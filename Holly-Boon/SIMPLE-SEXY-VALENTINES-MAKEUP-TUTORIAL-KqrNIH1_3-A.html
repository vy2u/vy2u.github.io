channel if you're new here hello hi and
welcome my name is Holly Boone so in
today's video I'm going to be doing a
sexy Valentine's Day makeup look this is
perfect if you go out of your boyfriend
if you've got on a date if you're going
out of your girl mates if you're sitting
at home with ice cream watching film you
know it's perfect for everything you do
not need a boyfriend slay this look you
don't need a date just lay this look
yeah so the first thing I want to do is
my eyebrows like always I'm going to use
the brow gel from Primark this is a
sculpt and fix Jiro brow gel and crayon
they crayon I don't use because it's not
the right color I picked up the wrong
shade and it's not my kind of brow
product anyway I'm just gonna comb some
this through my eyebrows I'm gonna just
let that dry down for a minute oh baby
baby it's just Lex okay so I'm gonna use
my NYX micro brow pencil in the shade
black I love that prymaat brow pencil
but I ran out and pum up for me is like
so long to get to so I haven't had a
chance to go and pick up another one but
I'm gonna go and get a ton coz that brow
pencil is the same as this one and it's
obviously cheaper so I think gonna go
pick up a ton of them can we not with
this bit of hair basically I used to
shave that bit of hair off and I've
always used to shave this little bit of
hair off so I had a really straight neat
hair line and I'm really over doing that
because I mean it doesn't worry about
expiry or anything I think grows back
fine but it's so annoying having to keep
shaving it and then it's like it just
grows back so quick so I just rather try
and grow how I think I do not do that do
not shave your hairline so I'm gonna
cover up my eyebrows and also for my
shadow base I'm gonna use my makeup
revolution concealer concealer in define
in the shade c5 you're probably sick of
hearing about this concealer now but I'm
just obsessed it's like the only
concealer that I've been using since I
found it
and I'm going to use my Sigma e 50 a
cream color brush
so I'm really sorry if the light keeps
going in and out it's just I'm so over
it honestly this one I cannot fit any
more lighting equipment in this room
because it's so tiny so I think I
probably need more lighting but I just
can't fit in basically I'm going to put
some translucent powder on top you can
see you'll are just a tiny bit so for
this look I want to do something quite
soft on the eyes and then I want to do
like a bold lip I want to be something
that's easy for you guys to recreate
it's not gonna take you hours and hours
and hours because he'd only got time to
that so I'm going to use my violet was
my Holy Grail palette I haven't used
this in its forever and I used to love
this and we take the shade transition on
this Sigma e30 8 brush and just apply
this lightly just above the crease yes I
could I want to do too much with the
eyes already somebody's gonna make my
brown eyes really stand out um but quite
soft like I don't want to do too much
because I wanted to really bold lip see
how what are your plans for Valentine's
Day what you up to are you doing
anything with your girl mates you doing
anything with your boyfriend if you've
got a day are you just gonna chill on
your own and watch films because that's
just as good me and Todd we're not doing
anything actually on Valentine's Day but
next weekend we're going to see thriller
in London and I'm a huge Michael Jackson
fan so I'm actually really pissed off
myself that I haven't already seen it
what am i doing when I study can be
forever like I'm always like for years I
feel like I need to see for a lot in the
West End and I just I feel like time
just goes so fast I just don't know time
flew by but I'm finally going to see
annum so excited
also some people that went to college
with are in the shows and that was quite
cool so I'm just gonna take this shade
right here which is cool are you kissing
me okay on my blank canvas a 42 brush
and I'm gonna put this right in the
crease unless you just ordered these
brushes the other day and I really love
them they're not very expensive and
they're really good so if you're looking
for good eye brushes that are cheaper
check
this blank canvas brand I also got
another one from might come it's this
EADS hand brush and it's a really small
blending brush I used the other side
it's got path on it but these ones
already good luck if you're doing loads
of colors if you're layering a load of
colors and you really want the deep like
that's the tiny little detail then
definitely get that as brushes they're
really good I ordered mine off PB Bay
I'll link them below anyway if you guys
want to get them but yeah the small
detail brush is good and also this one's
really good forget it in the crease
scans it to my Sigma brush and blending
the two shades together okay so I'm
going to use the same blank canvas brush
that Eve was here and I'm going to hit
show brownie points it's this dark brown
here and again I'm just gonna put that
right in the crease I'm gonna darken up
a little bit just a tiny because I do
want the eye look to be quite soft like
I said whenever I go for a bold lip I
don't like to do too much on the eyes
because I want the focus to be on the
lip not the eyes if you guys have been
following me on snapchat you'll know
I've literally been in the gym right
every day the last huy and my body is in
bits like I've definitely think I need a
rest day right
I've been training different body part
though like I've left my legs to rest
for two days and I've been doing arms
back shoulders abs in good throat I feel
so good for doing it but my body is
aching so definitely that is she up in
here with me right now Peter J is so
underrated so underrated
so I'm going to take this shade toffee
which is this field gold shade on my
Sigma cream color brush and I'm just
gonna apply this and just kind of write
all over the lid really and just go back
in writing decreases this color because
I don't want to lose that sorry the next
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
take my Marc Jacobs this is the eyeliner
and it's in the shade brownie which is
my favorite brown eyeliner it's a nice
chocolatey Brown and it's really creamy
as well and I'm going to just apply this
along the lash line sadly
see web I did that cream liner it looks
a bit harsh so we're gonna blend it out
I'm going to use my luck smoky shader
brush from zoeva it's gonna soften it a
little bit so yeah we've just softened
that line because obviously we go for a
soft eyelet we don't want a harsh line
across the lash line these liners are so
creamy and really easy to smudge and
this shade brownie is just like the
packet brown so I'm gonna take some
white Maybelline gel liner and my zoeva
winged liner brush I'm going to apply
some of this at my top waterline so not
on the lash line but in the top
waterline I'm gonna add some mascara I
want to try this bad girl bang from
benefit numerous car they sent me this
the other day and I want to see what we
think it's really hard for me because my
lashes aren't the best to demonstrate
mascara on to be honest I think the best
way to say this is good for me is on the
bottom lashes I'm gonna try the Queen B
lashes from Coco and he's my house of
lashes eyelash glue so we'll leave those
lashes to dry down I'm gonna use my Mac
prep and prime fix plus in this Senate
love and I'm obsessed with the smell I'm
going to use my Primark below primer and
I'm going to apply this in the center of
your face to pull my foundation I'm
going to use my Maybelline 24-hour where
I'm going to use the show caramel beige
mixed with this shade born I did just
spray a little more fact the fix plus
just for a bit more hydration so yeah
I'm going to mix these two shades
together and I'm going to apply this
with my Beauty Blender
I'm gonna take my makeup revolution
consider define in the shade c5 with my
under eye I'm gonna apply some just here
down the bridge of my nose oh my god
I've got my eyelashes again what's new
list it means I'm real quick dry
I just popped the lashes on I actually
really loved it is a really fluffy just
blending in my concealer with my Beauty
Blender
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to use my necks Foundation stick in the
shade rich which is 13 I'm gonna use
this for cream contour
so then I would use my beat bender again
I really don't know what I would do if I
beat you blender honestly like you know
I thought before the view Brendan came
out and we used to use makeup brushes
like what the I thought that makeup
brushes just I mean they do do a good
job but they just don't do as good a job
as a be render the view vendor is just
life
if you find that you put power to runs
are on
it just doesn't bronze you up as much as
you want try like a cream underneath
because it makes so much difference when
it's at its heinie bit under my eyes
nothing crazy we're not going to bake or
anything like that just a tiny bit of
powder I'm also gonna avoid this area
here because I am gonna apply liquid
glow so it's best just to avoid that
area I'm going to set my smile lines as
well which I wear on my nose because I
get what you up my nose with us I went
to the nail shop when I got my pinky now
fix this hand because it snapped and
then I so got my nails done I got home I
was like making some food and then I
snapped this now literally like two
hours after I've been to the nail shop
I'm gonna apply some bronze I'm going to
use my Mac mineralize skinfinish in the
shade duct tape got foundation in my
hair lovely gray else to the look hey
what they're getting foundation in black
hair is nowhere near his basket and
vanished in blonde her when I was really
blunt he's half white hair and back in
the day base get spray tans and you know
any sleeping your sprays hand I would
wake up and I would have like bits of
orange in my hair where my spray tan
could gone in my hair and when you have
white hair it's so hard to get out no
funny I copy me stuff white how you know
not an it she used to bleach it like
every week
I'm gonna take the show brownie points
no I'm gonna take my Marc Jacobs liner
that in that shape brownie I'm gonna put
this in the water line and I'm gonna
bring it down a little bit further as
well I'm gonna apply some of the bad
girl I'm gonna scar on the bottom lashes
and we're gonna see what we think
cuz bottom lashes is where it's up okay
I do think my bottom lashes are really
long so we're gonna do glow which I'm so
excited cause I'm going to use my iconic
London illuminated drops in the shade
original I love these drops forever you
already know if you've followed me for a
long time these are just my ride-or-die
I stopped using them for a while and
then I went back to and I was like why
the did I ever stop using them look
at I know and it looks so much better
than when you just put powder on I'm
gonna put powder on top because I like
an extra bit of pop but it just melts
into the skin but I'm just look at how
der at all
so next I'm going to spray my face with
some of the fix+ make my skin nice and
wet when I apply this next product I'm
gonna spray some on my brush and we're
gonna be used in the new ivory highlight
from Anasazi Beverly Hills
I cannot down look at this look at this
it just looks so gorge
I think it just looks on a row and it's
just so creamy like look at this it just
melts into the skin it looks so good
isn't a powder it so I'm just gonna
swirl my brush in here I'm using my hi
cheap brand highlight brush from Sigma
what I do like to do instead of rubbing
it when I've applied the drops on top I
like to press it in the skin rather than
rub because I don't want to disturb
anything underneath the trick is the
illuminator drops underneath it makes
the world of difference your highlight I
know the illuminator drops with my
London a little bit pricier 30 pounds
but the bottle literally lasted me a
whole year I worked for a whole bottle
but it took me a year and so I thought
your pound for the year is good because
you a need a couple of drops in the back
of your hand you don't you much product
at all especially if you're going on
vacation holiday you need the drops
because I drench my body in them one on
one holiday just seemed you out because
I'm gonna apply some to the body as well
I'm gonna use the open London drops
first of all on my finger and I'm just
gonna rub these and my collarbones rub
this on my collarbones and then just in
the center here I have a body state on
by the way it's from pretty little thing
it's a lazy body sticky I'll link it
below I'm gonna put this on my shoulders
as well and to say on this side and then
it means that I'm raising highlight on
top as well so I'm gonna use the same
brush and I'm just gonna I was so ready
for holiday and just to be going like
 I'm so ready for her so I want to
do a bold red lip with this look I'm
going to use my Patrick Starr brick
lip pencil which is the collection with
Mac
then I'm going to take my Anasazi
Beverly Hills liquid lipstick and the
shade strawberry
now if you want to be that bitch if you
want to be that bitch and just extras
 you can other glass like me or you
can just leave it like that
if you prefer it Matt I'm gonna add a
glass because you know I'm going to use
my patrick Star lip glass in the show
Patrick whoo another eyes on top
and then the last thing I'm going to do
is spray my morphe setting spray ok so
that is the finished look I hope you
