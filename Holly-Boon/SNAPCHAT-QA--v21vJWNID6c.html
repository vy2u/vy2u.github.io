snapchat Q&amp;amp;A because I haven't actually
done run things before and I didn't know
what to film so I'm going to be filming
that and so fast you've also asked me
questions on snapchat obviously a video
format so I'm just basically gonna go
through the questions and answer the
whoo um oh we're just gonna start from
the top
I'm hoping this is gonna actually play
like loud okay thank you
and I started wearing makeup when I was
about 14 maybe I saw up started doing
makeup there really and then kind of
went from there my makeup was really
terrible with age though but I've always
stood loved makeup even when I was
really little nice half days and when
they called it was like this is lip lip
brush you could get like a ball on the
top but everyone have it and it was just
like popping yeah
the reason why the YouTube channel
makeup was because I started praising a
lot of Instagram pictures of my makeup
of things and those of you started
asking me and to make YouTube channels
so yeah it took me quite a while to
actually get the courage to actually
start doing it and but I'm glad I did
because I really really enjoy doing it
now so definitely guys I did
I think that was dream job if it could
be anything in the world and I don't
know really that's a hard one dream job
probably not I know sorry I was like 9
oh I guess thank you and so I like I
said like before basically it was just
posted me start pasting make our
pictures and then I started getting
quite accomplished with it and I am
self-taught so I'm still learning now
I'm still not obviously perfect eye
makeup but yeah I just kind of everyone
started asking me to do it so we just
went from there really don't grow up too
quick therefore you don't grow up too
quick I think when you're a teenager you
just feel like in a hurry to be an adult
and use when you grow up really question
when I turn 18 and then you want to turn
like all these ages and this is like no
I like live your life as a teenager and
as a triode and just enjoy every moment
of it and don't grow up too fast that's
why I would say oh my god I think he
wants me wait what did I give her
Christmas do have a boyfriend and has
great eyebrows okay Christmas I just got
my knee because I'm really hard to buy
for I'm really fussy so a lot of people
just tend to give me money because it's
easier and yes I do have a boyfriend
I've been with him nearly three years
now
I'm trying to get into a boyfriend time
for me but his norm for it so sorry guys
um and what was the last Oh eyebrows I
just kind of let them grow I don't pluck
them just leave them yes they look a hot
mess for a while but it's definitely
worth it in the end because I used to
put my rose so thin and then I decided
to just leave them and just deal with it
being horrible I used to work with money
to party anyway and you
how people thought me there so yeah I
just say just try not to them just
really try not to and it's definitely
worth in the end I think anyone should
wear makeup if it makes you feel good
and you feel you want to express your
creativity no matter what gender you are
or who you are why not like makeup
supposed to be fun then people need to
stop making it out to be a bad thing
it's the place to be fun it's a way of
expression your personality it's just
one of those things where I think it's
being people who taking it way too
serious and it's really not that serious
so yeah do what the hell you
Center Parcs I'm good onstage as I love
set apart I actually love Center Parcs I
want that in someone and it's so nice
and dark circles I would say the Becca
under eye corrector I love that for dark
circles and I have quite dark circles
and that works amazing for me and what
else did you ask me I'm sorry I was so
bad but yeah
Becca under right I've got it here right
now Becca under-eye brightening
corrector this is my ride-or-die so
definitely that my biggest beauty makeup
what I adore is probably Carli bybel I
love her she is incredible she just
seems like such a humble person and she
is flawless like literally for us I look
at her and I'm like oh um also I look up
to are easy I love her I love her just
everything about her I think she is fab
and also filter list a Amanda ending I
love her like I wish you love her she
always say to me seems like such humble
person and she seems really lovely so
yeah I love her as well
ah favorite climbing band brand sorry
for Instagram is my bandage dress I work
for them as you guys probably know and I
just am in love with them I get offered
a lot to work with for different
placement companies in the Instagram and
I'm really fussy and as you guys know
hitching my brain addresses putting the
only one that I work with and I went for
about you you know nearly a year
actually know a lot about six months I'm
exaggerating but definitely my brand new
strands just amazed in and favorite
makeup brand is Too Faced I love the
packaging packaging is so cute and not
as you guys know that semi-sweet
chocolate palette is my life and also
I've got the liquid lipstick on today
this one is let me to see it's the top
is the melted chocolate lipstick in
chocolate cherries lips you love this so
I say to your face is definitely my
favorite makeup around to face girl to
face girl as you may be Anastasia
Beverly Hills as well because she slaves
my life I love her okay so I work I did
work part-time admin and now I work in a
marketing department and I work Monday
Tuesday Wednesday and then I have my
Thursday Friday sunny Sunday just
focusing on why it's around on my
youtube and things like that so that's
kind of cool I want to eventually be
able to have this is my full-time job
because this is what I aspired to be
doing and and cosmetic-surgery I knew I
wanted a boob job from sort of the age
of like 17 because I stopped growing
when I was about 14 and I knew from then
I was gonna get one like I was gonna
have a boob job so I'm just kind of
saved and that's it really
if you don't follow Joey's makeup you
need to follow him like me and him I
like their site but makeup wise he's
just everything my favorite thing about
making YouTube videos I think as we
asked I've got a strap to might link up
okay my favorite thing about making
YouTube videos this is quite difficult I
would say I love inspiring you guys a
lot of you always would be like what
would you inspire me so much that isn't
it she that means everything to me like
that is the nicest thing anyone can say
and I've also loved just I just loved
the whole thing making the videos edit
in I just find it so much fun like it's
like a massive hobby of mine now like
I've absolutely loved it at first it
used to scare me to put my edit in and
things I thought my app so you love it
now so I would say the best thing about
filming to making videos you guys and I
also love anything that I know like I've
got a massive thing for it so yeah I go
check out there was makeup my favorite
animal I am NOT an animal person I so
like I don't really like animals like
you're not gonna hate me right right now
but I am NOT a huge animal person I love
dogs
I feel like dogs are literally like
family members I dogs are the cutest
um but favorite animal oh I don't have
fun
I think giraffes are like welke um I
don't have one sorry dogs three dogs
dogs definitely faced doctor said the
packaging is so cute they take so much
time and effort into their packaging and
the products are one of my favorites so
definitely see phase 100% if I could do
anything in the world popping YouTube
job wise I don't know I honestly don't
know I feel like YouTube is like one of
the best jobs ever
yeah I thought YouTube is one of the
best jobs ever because I get to sit here
talk to you guys show you makeup like
makeup is like everything like I love
makeup so I just think this is probably
one the best job you can have instead
YouTube videos oh yes thank you
everybody stay logged in my house theory
does my head in
I'm like I'm filming a video now and
they were like shutting up the stairs
and running up the stairs yeah Rachel
you were so cute and not I've never
forgotten my glimmer folks I'm only like
5 foot 4 so I think I can but yeah thank
you
my strength in myself I would say as I
am quite confident and I'm proud of
myself being this confident because I
never used to be I used to be so
insecure so you should look in some
Instagram girls like oh my god I want to
be them and you see it quite down about
it but I'm Popeye myself now I feel it
one of my strengths is definitely
confidence I'm talking much more
confident I used to be so shy as well
like when I used to meet your voice but
I'm really shy but now I just feel like
so much more confident and my weakness I
would say I can be really lazy like I
struggled to make thank myself sometimes
I might Holly come on
a day is getting on you need to
took your iPhone so yeah my weakness is
definitely laziness who inspires me the
most
oh that's a hard one beauty wise in the
beauty community onion on YouTube and
the president inspires me the most is
probably Carli bybel I literally love
her and she just I just think she's
everything and inspires me also
Amory's e that is kind of like my icon
so the people I look up to people I'm
like whoo yes that is me like I need to
do that up that I need to do that okay
that's basically it I think
for this house they're with you when
you're first got them done Oh
my lips weren't really smaller they
weren't really thin they weren't always
like a little bit plump but I just
wanted them like more emotion to my face
that glaze we were like I'm a good man
and he may but literally I love them now
because they're just more powerfully
like I used over to my lips anyway so I
basically just got like first of all I
got no point five mil and then I take
the time I've got one mil and yeah I was
so scared like and I'm not gonna lie my
pain threshold is quite good and I even
though I had an AMA groom herself I
still found it quite painful especially
when they put the needle in like the top
here and like this certain sensitive
parts that it does hurt but yeah oh yeah
do her boyfriend and he never was to be
my social media I did wanna do the
boyfriend tag but he's like nice so yeah
you might be able to meet in one day
guys one day
oh hi and my favorite lip color okay so
my favorite lip color was the Mack spice
lip liner as you guys know I wear that
all the time but recently I have been
living for this color like I'm wearing
every single day since about it and this
is the melted chocolate lipstick in
chocolate honey is this brown shades
light brown and it goes really well with
the Mac strip-down liner and I've been
wearing it like this smoky Brown eye and
I've been living for it like it has been
my ride-or-die for the last like two
weeks so I'm gonna say max spice but I'm
gonna say this with Mac's trip down
liner is my favorite as of now okay so
yeah there are laser questions on his
field I'm sorry for didn't get runs
answering your question but this video
is already like 20 minutes long so I'm
gonna shut the up but I hope you
guys enjoyed this video you got to know
me a bit better and I hope I answered
