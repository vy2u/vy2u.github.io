filming this soft cut crease with like a
coral lip it's perfect for like summer
and I'm just kind of like spring/summer
that type of vibe also you guys are
asking for prom makeup and this really
nice soft cut crease would be a perfect
for prom and then you could switch up
with whatever lip that you want edge you
could do a nude or if you had like just
a white dress you could go for the
corals it's nice and summery um but yeah
I hope you guys enjoy this tutorial and
so if you want to see how I got this
look then please keep watching so I'm
actually gonna start with my face makeup
today because I just feel like and I'm
not gonna use redock shades on the eyes
so yeah so available to prime I'm gonna
use the Smashbox primer Ward's up okay
so for Foundation and what do we mix in
the Make Up For Ever HD foundation and
the Marc Jacobs and Markle foundation
this is my favorite combination at the
moment and purely just because I prefer
the formula mixed together rather than
separate also with the whole Beauty
Blender thing on my last video those of
you I was asking that how we do can your
beauty beauty blenders because mine has
so many stains on it and I was cleaning
of Annie back and it just wasn't working
and those of you said to try coconut oil
mixed with washing-up liquid add it work
yeah thanks guys
okay so now if we can see like I'm going
to be using the Maybelline fit me
concealer otherwise because you're not
half it about this and it's a shade 20
so I'm just gonna set that I'm gonna use
the nine apart by a for cuz my eggs and
this brush is the highlight brush by
zoeva
so just to warm up my face I'm going to
use the Mac it give me some skin finish
and this is a Real Techniques brush is
just a powder brush
so next to Kwanzaa I'm going to be using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills shade Java
this is from the medium palette and I'm
going to be using the luxe shared cheek
brush by Ziva I'm pretty sure you can
buy these separate as well so if you
don't buy the whole kit you can just get
this one
so I'm just going to contour my nose and
I'm going to use the Sigma medium
sweeper brush and obviously the same
shade I'm just going to take my PC
Brenda and just literally press over
that the only way I find the RG burns it
out and doesn't make it look obvious I'm
just gonna make a start on my eyes now
so I'm just gonna carve up my eyebrows
and I'm gonna use the Maybelline fit me
concealer and I'm also going to use my
mac 242 brush to do this because I try
to do it with a brush a few times and
it's quite difficult
so when I pray I just used the same
concealer just run it all over my eye
and then I'm going to set it with a
powder just to make sure that if you set
your primer or concealer whatever using
your eye first
you slipped it with a powder it just
makes it a lot easier to then blend
other powders on top so make your life a
lot easier
also it's going to prevent any creasing
as well you don't want crease thailand's
said I'm just gonna set that it's gonna
use my banana powder I think okay so for
all over my lid I want to cover II I
think I want a white one it's like
really bright so I'm gonna go with white
because it's the lightest color you can
get so I'm gonna use the naked this is
the Naked 3 palette ake this shade here
which is called strange
I petite crease brush I'm going to go in
with shade Peach Smoothie by makeup geek
so this shade here you don't want to go
into heavy festival you just wanna
literally apply this so softly because
you don't want it to be too hard so when
I get to this area here I'm just gonna
flick one out a little bit me don't you
have to do that if you don't want to you
can just let you rammed it off okay
don't worry if you get any on the lid
because we're going to cut that out
again anyway so don't worry about that
next I'm going to take my medium sweeper
brush by Sigma and we're take shade for
I paint my makeup beeps of this shade
right here
and then I'm just loose you're going to
talking up this crate
I'm just then going in with that to take
crease rush by Zoe Weaver blending that
up with slightly and then just to carve
it I'll make sure it's super sharp I'm
gonna go into my mac 242 brush and that
white shade this shade right here just
going to go over that
as you can see I've like really flicked
mine out every day I just have to pick
it out this one if you don't want to but
I just prefer mine like that but it just
depends on whatever you prefer yeah I
think I'm gonna add a wing so I'm gonna
take my zoeva winged liner brush and the
Sigma gel liner
I'm gonna do all of this I will come
right and then do this one off camera
just because it'll be a lot quicker so
I'm going to use the extended play
mascara and that so for lashes I'm going
to use the House of lashes iconic you
know I'm obsessed with I've got eyeliner
on me by the way oh and the lash glue
that I'm using is this salon system
natural lash adhesive okay so now I'm
just gonna finish off my eyes so I'm
gonna do my under eye and first of all
I'm just gonna take this crease brush by
Zoe bar and I'm going to take the shade
and frappe by makeup geek they're shown
here then I'm just gonna replace the
mascara to my bottom lashes and I'm
using the extended play mascara by map
for highlight I'm going to use the over
cosmetics you do you highlight are so
annoying because I very care like a how
do you my staircase when I went away and
I over my sickness get my makeup out I
need a broken so that's the situation
but I'm still gonna use it regardless
I'm gonna use there's a we've a
highlight brush I'm just gonna spray
some mac fix+ on the brush
because if ellipse I'm going to do
something bright so I'm going to use the
IFO cosmetics sunset beach just like a
really bright coral color I'm really
done a bright lip in a while so I have
actually used this before so this is the
first time
and so lastly I'm just going to spray
with my face or some mac fix+
