like a king
why are you making hello everyone so I
don't actually know what I'm gonna film
I'm just actually gonna play around and
see what happens I just know I really
want to make like gold and sparkly how
just put the Mac lip conditioner on my
lips before I start I always do this
lately I absolutely love this product
and when using it all time it's just so
good if you've got dry lips I get dry
lips in the winter really bad so it's
been really helping me anyway so we're
taking the brow gel right under start
dear Beverly Hills just going to brush
my hair and taking the brow is where I'm
starting bubbly hills this is a shade
dark brown I'm just going to fill my
brows
okay eyebrows the sisters are not twins
so I'm not gonna even try and make these
very symmetrical because it's just never
gonna happen
not really it should be maybe another
two information right now I'm gonna
start with my eyes because I'm when I do
get Arthur so always a fall out all over
my face makeup so first of all I'm going
to applies them as the Maybelline fit we
can see it out to my lips and I'm going
to take my Sigma fake precision brush
this is the f-89 brush
and I'm going to set that using the
laura mercier translucent setting powder
okay so I'm going to be using the Tarte
lip in bloom palette this is an all-time
favorite wine the court the colors are
absolutely gorgeous
and so first of all I'm going to take
shade smarty France this shade right
here on my Mac two to four
next I'm going to take my Mac 217 and
I'm just going to go in this shade right
here which is called jet setter my beer
is smashed by the way it's so bad all
that superstitious stuff like seven
years bad luck and all that jazz let's
hope not anybody even think that that a
nice nothing but a reading weird right
up my mine like if I put up an umbrella
in the house sight or doesn't know that
she would actually have a hard time she
started like in some superstitious stuff
boy that bears me I'm just I know very
blue
okay I'm going to go and be this red
radish shade hair one more ready Brown
added to this look and this is called
leader it's bit more powerfully than
Brady actually
you look like a really dark top path
what I would say
okay so next I'm going to apply a
glitter toilets and I'm going to take
the two-faced nude beam glitter it's
called this is a glamour dust I got this
Ruthie Vegas no palette and so I'm not
sure if you can write except for it but
if an aren't really real to get one a
similar color anyway I'll try and find
it on the website and link it below if
you can get it whoa threw me out of
breath you're running around trying to
find my yourself
I'm just going to leave that straw out
for a second if you put it on when it's
too wet isn't it likely oh it just goes
as like an oil shadow so if you do want
the foiled shadow type look then you can
apply it when the glue is more wet so
make sense and I'm just going to apply
it with my Mac 242
I'm going to take my pencil for a pencil
brush by first base I'm going to go in
with a true dark shade and just Pat that
on the outer corner hex I don't
okay so four lashes I'm going to take
these actually know what these are and
they are actually already there the
Revlon lashes and so first of all just
going to apply some mascara to my lashes
in the demure lashes glaze glue is so
good I guess I'm just a cos I'm going to
Sigma gel liner I'm just going to run
this in my top waterline because it
always helps to blend your lashes better
and from moisturizer matching use the
garnier ultralift ultralift de creme
so four founders founders was found ish
face of the foundation I'm going to ease
back ultimate coverage cream mixed with
the cover fix/enhance drops and to my
favorite combination at the movement so
I think I'm going to applies with a
Beauty Blender today instead of a kabuki
brush whatever no I've got a black
beauty brendham because it shows up so
I'm not going to the foundation art so
what nurses are if you want to get
stains up your Beauty Blender like I've
tried anything I try the Beauty Blender
cleaner try out see everything I'm going
to throw you can never get all this
stays out and then I saw someone say
that you should put your feet friend
right in the washing machine so that's
what I did and it definitely works
trying to get all the stains out and you
just spit like you've got brand new beat
Panda but brush cleaner and stuff has
never really get all these things out
for me I've also left up to like soap
for ages it's still not wet so washing
machine if you're the same as me
sit your booty right up don't put
clothes in there would you beat your
vendor you might end up with that
foundation win over you guys who's been
watching all the celebrity I'd if you
love it I love it it's like my favorite
for me when I hold on I'm like yes I was
a celebrity I would not know I don't
look good I've used a celebrity would
you go in there read up with a word I'm
too much of a website I was literally
scared of like every day night
everything I would think of is if I like
woke up from the despite rumors on it
let you see I would often call it
actually awards I can't die I know that
sighs read you my advice you think that
was
however we're going to take the fit me
concealer
with our wheel and oh how cute is here
floki I went to my granddad trying to
hook him up man
that dog is driving me crazy
what is she barking up Liz it she nobody
here intercept that with my reverse a
translucent powder I didn't do you
bender
so it's going to set their eyes on my
face using this Mac Studio Fix
perfecting powder
as you like to sit down and fill there I
can wait for a face I've got no way to
film not because I didn't want to film
it because I add it in like every retard
over there so lately I've just been
trying to spend as much time as possible
like teaching myself to edit and trying
to up my editing skills because take
some so long guys to edit one video it
takes me early soaked for five hours and
now I just got Final Cut Pro so we need
an IV V up until now and what I'll be
doing up now my last video and and I was
like no she's not good enough like I
need up my video I go so I spent nine
nine hours Hulot nine hours teaching
myself to use Final Cut Pro and I was
like okay but I still like no all of it
but hold on okay I wish I was at one of
these rigs like really good editors like
Joe whose videos I think are
unbelievable for edit his Amanda ends in
amanda ends his intros and her videos on
Joe I'm like girl you need to help me
out like can she make a video on how she
does that because that would just be
unbelievable but her editing is so good
also that you brought as a package all
of them not like all their editing
skills were crazy okay
gonna finish with my makeup oh okay so
first of all I'm going to take shade
jetsetter this shade right here and then
I'm gonna get this darker shade here I'm
gonna run this underneath my lower
lashline
okay then I'm just going to apply some
of the Joline Sigma gel liner into my
bottom waterline so from an inner corner
of my eye I want it really really
sparkly in a corner but this makeup is
perfect for even New Year Christmas
anything like that you can pair it off
it you can pair this eyelet with pretty
much either
like any lip colleagues I've read you
could have a nude of a read dark
burgundy I'm free online apple pear
Paulette because I'm a lip with this I
feel like so where's my butter
glow
okay so I was gonna put some in the
inner corner of my eye
cuz I'm going to add some sparkle
because I want it like pop
sparkly in a corner the glitter ombre to
use is the Mac or flex gold glitter it's
a really nice white glitter flecks of
gold anyway so I'm gonna finish up my
face so I'm going to bronze real quick
so let's hit the mat give me son and
this stipple brush from Lottie London
so for cons I'm going to take the
half-hearted shake by makeup geek I've
been using this all the time lately I
love it
so yeah this is just like a really tiny
stiff brush from that
okay so I'm gonna wear some blush always
peachy shade right here which is by my
fat leakers where I've been loving this
this is shade infatuation so time to
highlight my favorite part of the whole
entire makeup look I'm going to take the
stroke of genius palette by NYX this is
really really inexpensive and amazing if
you want a really really good highlight
planet I personally like to mix these
two shades but I mostly just use this
bright shade and I'm going to take this
brush quite understandable because this
is the a 2/3 brush to spray that and
throw my face
so I think I'm watching my go-to nude at
the moment because those have you been
asking me what my lip combo been wearing
so I'm first we're going to take strip
down by Matt this is a lip liner it's
brown nudie Brown shades or you know
okay then for lipstick and when I take
peach stock why Mac which is this new
shade so gorgeous this you want my
absolute favorite
so that is why going to lip color
