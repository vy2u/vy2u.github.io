like she just died it some sweating for
actually dries it's just a mess so yeah
so this video was actually supposed to
be my blog but my stuff got stolen so I
just thought I'd let you guys know about
what happened and how it happened and
stuff because I just want you guys to
read carefully when you go away or if
you go anywhere just be really careful
and mindful of your staff because I
think sometimes I mean I can be a little
bit naive a little bit silly they think
the things are going to happen what they
do so just be careful wherever you're
going just make sure you re careful so
I'm going to be a bit too careful rely
quite carefree tough person sometimes it
can be a bit too much and then I just
show this happens to me basically so
it's going to explain the story so if
you're looking that's out or Instagram
or anything are you pretty when I was
talking about when is nut chat but I got
robbed when we went away so I went away
for five days with the girls we did a
campaign with a floats company for I
believe I went to I believe oh so much
fun like we have seen amazing patients
and so grateful and we just had the best
time
after that we're such a laugh it was
really good we say this amazing Villa
for two nights
two nights we checked out of the villa
on the last day we checked out 3 p.m.
and our flight wasn't until like 11
o'clock at night so we decided we
obviously well we obviously have loads
of hours to kill so we decided to go
grab some food somewhere just get in the
minivan drive around and see where we
could find to e so yeah we do have a
minivan because so many of our and yes
we filled up the whole van with bags
suitcases bags everything that we need
to remember six were checking out and we
parked up and went and got some food so
yeah we went to eat and then loads of
the life of that up stop sucks they were
editing the film group editing the
little I love your buzzer sent on my
Instagram and it will clip with the bow
the yacht so editing that ready to go on
social media and I had my camera rocks
we were blogging and all that stuff so
where the comes out and I think Ruby and
watched I really do believe that we were
being watched like
we have so much equipment expensive
stuff out while you eat in I think
people thought they've got money Janata
means webbed up MacBooks everywhere
cameras everywhere like I had my own
Louboutin bag Sarah her Louie Vuitton
bag like I think from an outside point
of view people especially in front of
bodies of money we need to cut I don't
know how this happened I don't know but
anyway so after we've eaten and the guys
are finished it in what I needed to do
we still have hours to kill so one of
the vices why don't we go to this kind
like cliff top place I don't know what
it's called I'm really bad with names
but it's in Ibiza it's quite famous you
guys for you know I mean but it's like a
cliff top you basically Drive up there
park your car and you can go look over
the cliff it's really nice it's really
pretty
there's nobody up there actually there
was no one up there so we drove yeah we
drove up there parked the car and we
just left us up in the car left without
bags everything because we were
literally two minutes away from the bomb
we were like two minute distance away so
we left or something the band said to
the buyers you know should we have us up
listed yet if I'm only going to be here
five minutes just get some footage on
drawing and some pictures and stuff so
yeah through there for probably five ten
minutes ten minutes maximum ooh there
and so we go back to the van walking
back to the band which is obviously a
two minute walk no joke issue two
minutes you can see it from where we
were walk back to the van and my
Louboutin bag was just below the seat
the back sink I so going around we all
started up Winnie through the airport I
still get in the car
so when to get in the car I was like
where's my bag like I was thinking I
where's our I think cockpit had been
stolen I was just like where's my but
I've liked the car hadn't been broken
into
there was no smash windows nothing so
obviously we read this point we didn't
think a thought has been stolen so yeah
my bag was on the floor stupidly I
admittedly should not have left my
 bag in the car but I thought the
car was locked
we all thought the car results apart
from one of the guys said that the car
didn't lock so I was pissed off about
that because he should have told us he
should have said
by the way girls the van doesn't lock
and I would never ever left myself in
there regardless of who is in the middle
of a place and there's no cars
around I still would not have left my
 in there but because if I'm going
to try to actually break in the car it
smash the windows like we would've had I
did because we were that close to the
van so obviously they tried the doors
and luckily the doors are open they
managed to get loads of stuff so yeah
well Louie Vuitton bags on the floor and
I've worked again in the closet where
the fuck's my bag like my dad was here
where is it
so notice for our maybe it's been move
one of us has moved it so Jessica by
that you know like in my bag over there
like pop on my right it's not in the car
and then I guess you turn around I
realized the bag that had my laptops in
it my name is up so the black had like a
black hole doll type bag it was actually
under the sea but then he's been moved
on to the sea and I was like I was open
so I'm like why is this bad like why is
my holder bag it was under the chair and
now on the seat and it's open so I'm
looking in it and I'm like I laptops are
gone and I mean they're nowhere to be
seen laptops are gone a different unlike
we've been robbed so I'm like
we've been robbed so I like what was
being robbed my stuff's got all my
stuff's gone my million Vuitton
bag with all my in it like
everything in it my sunglasses my makeup
actually not everything was in that bag
and my laptop's
maps let's go and images up subscribe
and they even took my hard drives
they took my heart of all my work on it
so I'm sparking panic in the only reason
I'm panicking this was my passport was
in my bag in the inside pocket of my
loser thumb bag my password was in there
and I'm like how the am I going to
get home this is why I care about this
point it's my passport the other stuff
you know it's bad the exhausting Nick
budget so it is I can replace that
like I just want to get home right I
want to see my boyfriend missing my
family I just I just make it home at
this point
so I'm crying panicking like
stressing out because the guys will I
don't really we'll still be out of the
country and I'm like the charm and feel
better about the situation I'm like
there's no way in hell that I'm
getting out this country about Passport
because you can't so I'm actually a cry
stressing out like just want to get home
I don't want to be in the place I've
just been robbed I don't want to be here
so at this point myself have been taken
what's really strange about situation is
Becky one of the girls her laptop was it
she mixed my laptop by hers didn't get
taken from one an image but they went
through my bag which is so weird because
the bag was under the seat how did denim
jacket on top of all the staff so you
would have had to pull everything out to
find the laptops where's Becky laptop
was just literally their eye on the
floor next to mine so I'm just like I
understand that all my shits we've hated
but they didn't take Becky's up so and
they went through one of the guys back
in the front and you can take his
desktop but they went through images bag
which is at the front of the car check
on her you raise it one way or is about
all of our eyes have broken camera and
we set up her bag and the ladder in
front of my study was up subnormal and
but there was so much equipment in that
van when she'd never have even left of
stuff in there but because we were
actually a two minute distance away from
the brand there was nobody around we
thought that the band was locked all of
us was around rocks apart from the guard
then pops up and was like all by the way
cuz it doesn't lock it's not locked for
the whole holiday I thanks for
telling I shot him in his so I was
region I went offer him eyes I'm sorry
but you should have told us at
the fanzine locks if you did told us
that the president will never ever
aggress my shooting nurse did I mean so
anyway at this point we've just had to
accept the fact that all of our ships in
stolen all of my staff image and staff
and Joe stuff's been stolen and the rest
of people got their stuff anyway so
going to the airport going to the police
we should report this I'm going to the
police to report it dis let them know
what's been stolen so I said to the
police as I I've had my passport stolen
can it go out of the country now like no
you can't sorry you can't go out the
country guestlist the embassy this is a
Saturday night the Embassy is closed and
then it's a Sunday and Sunday Sunday the
embassies crisis I like that earlier
shaking real to get to the embassy to
get a pass for get it sorted out in
Monday I'm thinking where my goodness is
for a much one night money or my euros
have been stolen Michael my press bit
into my past and I don't then you take
my bank card just purely because
bankcard was wrapped in my wrapped in my
receipts so obviously they didn't see it
there but it was in there but I had to
cancel my cards because I thought they
took them that I thought they took my
card so I canceled my card
it took my euros and no money nothing
I'm like where the am I going to
say that what are my opportunity to do
that I've really just are as if you like
what the
and I was just like I plan to do with
this anyway
literally luckily one of the lads gets a
call while we report it to the police
and the guy Joe checked the car checks
everything like check the whole car just
to make sure because they had to return
it like the van just to make sure
there's nothing else in there and the
people that robbed to me has thrown my
passport and my purse officers given
that my past is very well past what I'm
impressed under the seat so Joe found it
can really I can put your passport I was
like thank the Lord for this
because I just wanted to get home that
you know in that that some another
17 years like I just want to get home I
just don't want to be here I just want
to go like my family my boyfriend
doesn't want to be with them and I was
just like me and image includes the
crimes we just are so violated it wasn't
a fact that it's this stuff like you
know some material sick things at the
end of they they can easily be replaced
I'm not bothered about that but
is the fact that someone's got my things
and someone's gone through in my bag and
took my stuff it's just such a horrible
feeling like it's just so violated and I
was just pissed up they took my
hard drive because I'm sorry
they don't need my hard drive my
hard drive is like 30 pound what
they gonna do that it's got and like a
year and a half's worth of work on it so
I was just like crying about that
because it's like all that works gone
and my laptop I'm just like so you
guys to go on Find My iPhone on our
iPhones and make sure that I refit Wi-Fi
laptops so I watched every cent of my
macbook put a pin on there and their
security message that since these
laptops been stolen so in as they try
and set it now they won't be able to
consider message on that says it's in
stolen and yes over 7/10 real to unlock
it that I've got I just always make this
video because I know is you guys are
asking how it happened and just thought
it'd be easier just to sit down and
explain rather than type it
on Twitter but just where you guys be
careful whatever your body just don't
leave your anyway honestly even if
divided away for two minutes
don't leave yourself honestly zone I'm
so naive and so carefree sometimes like
I said I just don't think things are
going to happen to me so just honestly
be careful like please where we do keep
your passport in your pants the
whole time like keep your passport near
sugar-coated it I hope you don't of it
but yeah I'm not gonna bite now because
it's just one of those things I see
other happens all the time it's one of
those things I wasn't asked about
materialistic stuff I just wanted to get
home in my passport I said about like
literally when I found out my ship is
stolen I was like where's my passport
like oh I wish my house was like
your home like she said and obviously
that bag I brought I've always wanted to
design a bag like since I was about 16
and was like I'm really like a nice bag
a really nice luxury designer bags but
my last week an Endicott Stalin it's
offering us a sign I'm not gonna buy any
more designer bags I'm over it
 that I'm just not even doing it um
but yeah might also what's annoying is
when I got back home obviously my
suitcase has suffered if I couldn't
actually remember what was actually in
my Louis bag on my bag I didn't know
what was in there I couldn't think
because I was panicking I was like what
header on my passport but I just was
thinking like I wonder if I put like my
hard drive and weather in my suitcase or
did I put this in my suitcase just
didn't know so when I go how much the
you can empty my suitcase towards
position light is that so mask me I just
cried I was like fat but I just remember
it all this stuff that's in that bag
that's gone now like my all of
my makeup brushes you can imagine a lot
of makeup brushes my palettes are in
there because obviously I travel with my
palettes in my hand luggage because I
want to get smashed with it in my
suitcase and wipe out my eyes my
favorite eyeshadow face glow kit and
felt like my power does everything is
all in my own bag and they took that and
I was just like my Celine sunglasses are
in there they were like my ride-or-die
sunglasses they were in that bag so
they're gone
I have just lost everything I'm
sorry up
I'm just gotta had the money threw up to
do is to replace his stuff because if I
didn't I would be stressing out like I
just yeah it's my work do I mean is that
not only if that did they take my laptop
and take my stuff that for my work
that's a year and a half worth of work
was on that hard drive and they took my
hard drive I just so up let's
just I was just hoping and my hard drive
was in my suitcase and when I got home I
got my new laptop I would be able to put
my stuff back on without something I'd
have it all and log into my account all
on there I never used to keep aging and
lapse at least keep it on my hard drive
because my laptop you some ran out of
storage so yeah I don't know I don't
know videos just I just thought I'd let
you guys know because if you go anywhere
just someone after going partying our
beaver and a male or any Webster going
anywhere if we just miss you guys
anywhere even in the UK anywhere just
please watch your stuff please because I
feel like we were watched from when we
ate at the restaurant
and I think we were followed because I
don't understand how that would have
happened I think we were definitely
followed without realising because if we
do it all the times I mean they probably
still be the all the time it's just
their lucky day that the van was open
and was it locked so yeah just please be
careful and I'm back to making videos
and off because my memory card
for my camera
luckily I took my camera updates up but
my memory card was in the inside pocket
of my bag which had almost 30 jokes I
blocked the whole week and has some
really funny footage not everyone is
uploaded
that's gone now in it so yeah
but as I'm as I'm safe and I'm well and
healthy and stuff as little as I don't
know about the other stuff so we're able
but yeah keep your passport inside your
vagina the whole time because also you
won't do any through the blog because
Imogen how to have footage go I was
Imogen channel and watch the blog she's
uploaded it and you can see what we got
up to over there so it was kiddin
feeling about Robson
see I hope you all enjoyed it and I
in my neck Vicki Oh fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
