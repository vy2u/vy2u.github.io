smoky eye
mmm I'm obsessed it's not my new
favorite look I think I love this so
much and so yeah if you want to find out
how i got this makeup look then please
keep watching okay so first of all I
just did my eyebrow off camera and my
eyeshadow base I used the benefit
precisely my brow pencil this is been my
favorite at the moment and you may mean
the eraser eye concealer and shade nude
like I always used first of all I'm
going to take the shade at Peach
Smoothie
on my Mac two to four brush I'm going to
use this for my transition color so I'm
just gonna apply this shade it just
above the crease so I am using a
different camera today because this one
for some reason enlightens but I wanna
use this camera and this is my just my
Sony one that I use for picture it's
only a 5 100 anomaly's my canon for
makeup tutorials but it just makes me
look too saturated into orange I need to
play around the settings and just try
and slow it out because it's rate
already sorry I'm gonna take my naked
heat pallet love is pilot so much when I
use the shade sauce and again I'm going
to take this on my Mac to t4 and I'm
just gonna run this in the crease so
yeah I do apologize if the quality of
this video isn't as good and it's just
because I'm using a different camera I'm
gonna yeah sort out the settings on that
kind of but I need to ask a profession
was like summer II don't know wandering
eye down son any like Tamra's about what
I do is press record
see Irene so that again I'm just going
to go back to the show keeps me eating
soften the edge now I'm going to take
the shade here you devil which is this
shade right here I'm going to use this
shade on my morphe M 506 brush and I'm
just gonna apply this shade right in the
crease
I'm just bringing it all the way in and
on the way out
I haven't done a smokey eye like this in
so long it's been summer and my first
time has just been and gone I'm
just over it
I'm not about the weapon everybody got a
memory sorry I'm just a typical British
peasant but I'm over the weapon now I'm
just I've accepted that someone's gone
and I want to accept it but I've
accepted it so now I'm moving on to more
like my vibes my teacher Ozai always at
my nose to March so when what my name
was on today a just so I could film and
went out of match these are the lengths
I go to for my content I just like
everything to look matched that make
sense I did love that balloon I fought
the Brailler core with the yellow when
kalila tutorial for that look all I
needed
I couldn't do blue nose with this it
would just a hot mess well if she get
one out I like every week because I'm
just like right I'm gonna film this this
week someone he pronounced to be like
this people do you mind has a probably
like oh my god like she's back again I
don't actually have a microphone in my
camera I just used the microphones in
the camera because I don't know how to
do with that that honestly I'm
noise untechnical person when it comes
to cameras and light and shadow that I
literally have no idea but I do want to
get like oh maybe a mic for everything
it might sound a bit better I don't know
let me know down below if you think I
should need to get a mic you think it
was some better probably get really
professional okay maybe a puppy huge
either so I'm gonna take the same brush
which is the movie and 506 and I'm going
to use the shade and throw angle and
then I'm gonna apply this in the crease
again just darken the art I'm just
basically building up the colors because
you read I want to go in straight
whatever dark hollow you just need to
build it up and it will just be easy for
you to pretend that way as well maybe
they spot that he's driving me crazy
I went for a stage if I'm gonna bad
break
I was breaking up all here oh here I
don't know what why I did whether I was
just stressed or like I scouts get that
time of the month maybe it was like and
I'm not gonna lie I neglected my
skincare routine for a little bit for a
hot minute and I think that might be
something to do with that I just like I
don't know I just knew that did it I
just used to cleanse my face wash my
face that would be it like every day but
I started cleansing toning moisturizers
and glycolic acids Kenzo using oils
doing masks again and my skin seems look
cleared up if you were to do like I was
gonna do it I could get on ready with me
type video where I just show you like
what I do when I take em thankful I use
cuz I started using the Urban Decay it's
like a melt off makeup spray that you
spray it on your face and it literally
melts your makeup off and then I like to
wash my face with stuff afterwards and
you just I feel like it's the only thing
that gets rid of every single bit of
makeup of my face I feel after as I
thought yes like all more makeup is off
you know what I mean so next I'm gonna
take the shirt EMBO which is this shade
right here on my Sigma e30 for brush and
I'm gonna pack this on the lid I don't
want to bring up too high because I am
gonna blend out the edges I don't want
to put yeah well it's a cover wife just
laid down yeah if you want me to do that
video I get I'm ready or like a skincare
of something like that then I'm give the
video a thumbs up so I know see what I
did there
cheeky little give us a thumbs up and
I'm just going back to the shade and for
a wing look I don't like it man at that
like why don't I say that last minute
and then I'm gonna just blend out the
edge Cheers
hey guys its delivery fussing here and -
it's my eyelashes I would assume the
eyelashes because I ran out I'm so glad
they came clean she I'm just much for me
I should silence home I was thinking
like I mean it girls like what am I
going to use I'm like my lashes glaring
having a wow that was perfect timing
so I'm not gonna use my Maybelline
lasting drama July night in the show
black I'm just gonna line my lashline
with this I'm using my Sigma yo six
brush I used a different eyeliner the
other day I think I had an allergic
reaction to it
it was the NYX you know the one that I
use from or yellow tutorial it was that
one I used it in black this eye I woke
up and it was like so swollen and right
and I was like oh god what my used and
that was the only thing that I use
different so you must have been that
which is weird though because the other
one was fine okay I actually got and my
cocoa ashes in the styling wall because
I always get them they're not my
favorite but I decided to order these
ones and these are the floor hello my
saying that right below below lashes
these are silk and these are in the
style I don't know what style is oh no
style yourself
I don't know below anyway this is what
they don't like they look so nice
they did it so full but I mean I'm about
that life so just gonna apply some of
the Mac extended play mascara okay so I
am just gonna use my clothes my lashes
because those ones are like full I love
them but I think they look nice with
like minimal eye makeup because I still
want to be able to see the eye makeup I
don't my lashes till it should be that
for you can't even see what's on my eyes
you know image it's kind of some cat
freeze done even following me for a
while I love this it's not my favorite
juice so we're gonna prime so I'm gonna
take some of the Rose the pixie Rose oil
burn just like a really nice oil and
it's like super hydrating I love it I'm
wearing it quite a lot recently
I've got it from Watkins fences and as
it Tut's and it's so nice I knew one
apply a tiny bit of disks oily but it's
just so nice because it's really
hydrating so I'm gonna take then takes
on my NYX angel veil primer and I'm
gonna apply a little bit of this it's
just a tiny bit just center of my face I
think it's just good fish moving out
pause I find it helps anyway I want to
try a new foundation situation today so
I picked up the Maybelline fit me matte
poreless foundation because I've seen
quite good reviews on this and I've
never tried it and this shade is not the
right shade for me but I want to mix it
with some of the L'Oreal True Match this
is in the shade golden amber I don't
like super matte foundations and I just
got this in case this is really matte
and this isn't completely the right
shade so I'm going to mix the two okay
that's a nice I thought it'd be like
quite thick do a bit too dark but you
cannot in it with concealer and stuff
lots of blending it down my neck over
you fine just smells I want to buy how
poised the foundation it's very nice but
I just watched my beauty sponge with
some raspberry anti-bacterial how much I
mean I normally mix it with the total
cover which is fine but in how many
total cover in my shade in Boots today
so I just thought I'll try that out make
a mask in the kitchen floor of us so
today for concealer I'm going to use my
Maybelline the erase I concealer in the
shade nude and also the Maybelline fit
me concealer in the shade 20 I'm going
to mix it - you know what I don't think
I'm gonna need this one today I'll use
this on a different day I'm just gonna
use the new raised I gonna bring it down
the size of when I sew I always do so
I'll say leave that to just dry a little
bit I'm gonna take my morphe concealer
in the shade nude and I'm gonna do my
nose highlight and contour so I'm going
to bring this down the front and then a
tiny bit on the end and then I'm gonna
press that in first of all with 3d
render and then I'm going to use my
iconic London cream contour palette and
I'm gonna take that on my morphe and
with three brush which is this little
brush right here which is so good for
contouring down the sides of the nose
and then I'm gonna round it off contour
just under here take my newzik sure I'm
sorry no dice makes the world of
difference that you can actually give
yourself a non-surgical nose job I'm
obsessed it's something it's so good I'm
just pressing this product in friends so
easy I'm gonna blending my underarms
using my 3d sponge again it's gonna push
it in bringing it up down the sides of
the nose down the side of where we
contoured this coverage is so good
because I was using this concealer
before but I took the sponge off and and
I was using it like with a brush and you
don't get as much coverage so I'm gonna
keep the pressure on this concealer
foundation looks so good oh my god oh my
god they've been together so nice they
had a concealer in the foundation so I'm
gonna take a separate sponge and I'm
gonna set my under eye and I'm using the
cover FX setting powder just don't
breathe in when you do this because the
other day I was breathing in for my nose
and it went up my nose and honestly it
was a worse thing of I like it just
smells horrible and I just breathed and
then in a little bit when I loved it
didn't taste very nice I've seemed in a
tiny bit so you can see exactly what it
looks like that it looks saw
bomb is exciter and I'm gonna break down
the size of my nose I've always there so
I'm gonna use my Stealer bronzer in the
shade dark and I'm gonna probably choose
my Mac 140s brush just gonna kind of
press and press it in just because I
don't disturb to pull out underneath I'm
really impressed with this Fantasia
my skin looks snatched a spot like I
literally can't even do right now
so I'm going to take my morphe contour
and highlight palette this is this is a
9c palette i'm gonna use this shade
right here to contours when I choose
with some cheekbones just one on it
really chairs or today I felt like it
you know you do my jawline it's gonna
bake a little bit underneath the contour
I'm gonna dust it off my nose
I'm taking it pretty hard shade from
this morphe palette I'm gonna run it
down the front of my nose okay so I'm
gonna use the benefit California uses
quite often I really like it that's fun
of it reminds a holiday good I can't get
over this foundation like my skin looks
insane and use the Urban Decay Naked
heat palette again taking that shade
sauce I'm gonna run that underneath then
using my morphe m5i six I'm gonna use
this shade he devil nut underneath same
thing on the other side then I'm gonna
go for the shade and for you go
then I'm still gonna used in war PM 506
and I'm gonna take that dark shade which
is M bar which are used all over the lid
and I'm gonna keep this as close to the
lash line as possible
this shade then I'm gonna take my black
eyeliner from maybelline and the Sigma
arrow six I'm gonna run this in the
waterline I'm gonna highlight and I'm
gonna use my Laura Geller gilded honey
I've been obsessed with this daily it's
such a beautiful highlights bitchy a
binman highlight is so good so I'm gonna
spray my face with some of the Mario
Badescu spray I'm also gonna spray my
brush this way I'm using my morphe M 5
10 brush you can highlight to
so from my lip color I'm going to use
the NYX way lip liner in the shade
vintage and then I'm going to use the
NYX lingerie liquid lipstick in the
shade cover ratio okay so lastly I'm
gonna take my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray set my face so that is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed
