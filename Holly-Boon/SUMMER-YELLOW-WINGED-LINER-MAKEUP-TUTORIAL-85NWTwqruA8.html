maybe narae's eye concealer with some
powder just to set it so now I'm going
to take my naked heat palette from Urban
Decay and I'm gonna take the shade sauce
which is this shade right here I'm gonna
take the shade on my Mac two to four
brush then I'm gonna lightly apply this
in the crease and then bring it all the
way up the lid as well once we light on
the lids
I don't eat into dark so for my yellow
wing I'm going to use this NYX vivid
bright yellow liquid eyeliner I love it
it's really really good I used it a
wooden stick the other day and you guys
asked me to film it and this line I
lasted all day didn't crack or anything
some people were like saying that
there's cracks but you sitting back on
me sir so we always start by just
drawing a line this way and then I like
to pull the skin here and I find it
easier to control the product bring it
back I'm just coming into this start of
my lashes which is here and I'm just
gonna need it up and then what I like to
do is I like to take a makeup wipe and
wrap it around my finger and then
sharpen up the edge so just a run money
makeup wipe along the edge
I normally really struggle with liquid
liners but I find this one really easy
to use so the brush is really really
thin and fine so it controls the product
very well I'm just gonna apply some
mascara and I'm using the Mac extend if
I'm just gonna apply little bit of this
so for my eye lashes I'm gonna use these
ones which is the iconic light I really
love these ones I've been wearing them
quite a lot lately
just stuck my lashes on and now I'm
gonna start on my face
so for primer today I'm gonna use my
Marc Jacobs remarkable primer I've been
using this all the time really it's
really loved it it was really nice and
hydrate in yes to the spot spotlight on
the backdrop thanks going on the corner
in one ounce video and told me how to do
it so I've just literally put a light
one of my umbrella lights about the
umbrella on and pointing up at the
backdrop and it just looks so much
better
so for my foundation today um oh my god
my foundation concealer in my last video
which is the hotman so let us look into
whether anyway I'm going to use my
hourglass stick foundation shade golden
tan and I'm gonna mix it with my Too
Faced Born This Way
I like the both together so then I'm
gonna use some of the Too Faced Born
This Way in the shade golden and I'm
gonna apply this with my sponge this is
a sigma 3d blender I'm not sure if you
can get this in the UK but as I got mine
from Sigma Kusum
they did send me it but um yeah I'm not
sure if you can get this in the UK but
such a good sponge if not I'll just get
the beauty render cuz that's just as
soft but I like this one because I like
the shape it's really easy to go around
their eyebrows and stuff that's why I
always use this one but yeah the beauty
vendors just as good just as soft don't
like the RO Techniques sponge I find it
really hard to use because it's like
rock-hard coming off an of that one but
yeah I've had a breakout here and it's
really frustrating me that's just really
annoying me cuz I'm Brian sent over my
head I started to get blue nails which
is so weird for me because I always go
for nudes but I really wanted like a
past silly color and I saw this blue and
I was like oh I like that I'm gonna
apply some of the benefit brightening
concealer with my Sigma concealer brush
and then let's end this in with my
sponge I was playing around with makeup
and then to do this look the other day
was just playing around so I bought
loads of days NYX livid bright lip
liners everywhere to try them forgot
like there's so many colors I'm obsessed
so what you try that and then it's no
ca√±azo oh yeah she looks me pretty nice
and summery so yeah you guys asked me to
film it so what we do into so then I'm
going to take my maybe in the erase I
concealer in the shade nude and
everybody's again my my concealer Brock
you know what of me I always bring this
down the sides of my nose because I'm
just it's like a reverse contouring away
I'm gonna Sun someone eyes anyway cos I
learned how to do it for once I didn't
she have found a way to comment on my
nose after so long a triad I've tried so
many times console when I do find it
very difficult but I found a way that
works for me so I'm buzzing about that
okay so taking my sponge compress it in
I went shopping today and got loads of
new backdrops cuz I was like I really
just want like new colors and I knew I'd
do like a yellow when guileless I was
like I want a yellow a backdrop because
no matter what Keith and I've got loads
of colors I've got like green on olive
green a nude a red a peachy color which
is so nice I can't wait to use that yeah
I was saying on snapchat if you caught
me on snapchat all I use is them
blackout blinds and then I just like put
two holes in the top put some string for
in and hang it out and I just find them
so books they don't crease and they just
get really good so yeah and if you get
make one them because they're like that
material you can wipe it off
not that I'm gonna get makeup all the
way back here but it is possible
yeah like if you don't know how to get
like a nice backdrop and definitely try
black outlines cuz yeah like I said I
don't crease end it really good
I'm gonna use my cover FX powder today I
really like this powder and
in my last video that to face powders
wasn't I don't know it really bad
main wonder I like so bright so I'm
gonna take a separate sponge I'm gonna
just set my under eye these powders like
ten pounds I then try that ten pound
it's really nice it's a really nice
powder you looking for a cheaper really
compounded and definitely try this one I
don't get any flashback with it's good
it's a good powder okay okay now I'm
gonna snatch my nose use my morphe
concealer in the shade nude justice
price down the front of my nose little
bit on the end and then some on the
sides because he'll oh it smells so good
okay so you're gonna take my sponge
press this in right to make sure that I
press this concealer in before I go in
with the contour because then I find it
easier I was a feel like it will blends
in and it just looks and maths and then
I'm gonna use my iconic London at cream
contour kit I really like this for the
nose oh my god I throw tomatoes in my
eye
does your eye ever just go blaring you
see this like film wave your iron I'm
gonna use this shade right here on my
concealer brush and I'm gonna bring the
Sun sighs my nose I like to start from
the brow and then bring it all the way
down and then I'm gonna round it off at
the end and then contour the end of my
dice make it a shot I'm gonna take my
sponge brush press it in then we're
gonna bake down the sides of the nose
don't know why I'm shouting it's you
ready there we're gonna break down the
sides of the nose this I'm gonna let
that chill I want to finish off the rest
of my face
bronzer I'm gonna use my Stila bronzer
in the shade dark and I'm gonna use my
Sigma large angled contour brush
well there's that Charlotte Tilbury
foundation you know it was like really
yellow and I was like ah but when I
blended into something it's okay well
anyway I used it and then I took some
pictures on flash and it was like yellow
like I was so bad it was so so bad and I
just gonna ride but it just throughout
the day it was just going a bit like
patchy after a while so that shot
Tilbury foundation just went straight in
the band I was like this
and then I do just want to chisel a
little bit today so I'm gonna use my
morphe 9 C contour palette and I'm gonna
use mmm-maybe this shade right here this
shade on the same contour brush can you
hear outside
it's literally absolutely chocolate now
I'm afraid and windy is which is
weird because when I went out earlier
sweating it when I was done and stuff it
was like really sunny
that's England for you that is the UK
for you it's so unpredictable be festive
is this weekend and I'm just like I was
gonna go with pretty little thing I got
invited to go them but I was just like
cosmos good tomorrow but I just can't do
a few UK wear but I can't do a bit so if
it's gonna rain I'm not gonna be at
first of all I just can't pull that mud
and everywhere I just no officer
wasn't not like Coachella okay but it
was not as best it was new UK are really
nice but I just can't be asked to rely
on the web on but hopefully anyone's
going to be festival and I really hope
the web stays nice for you I'll say a
little prayer for you let's finish off
the eyes so I'm gonna take that shade
sourced from the Urban Decay palette
which is the color that I used with the
lid I'm gonna run this underneath my I
feel like I'm such a typical British
person and like I always talk about the
wave art as an easy most of my videos
but I'm always talking about how I hate
UK wherever or I'm just talking about
the weather in some way out overnight so
if you didn't already know I hate the
you came over
okay so I'm going to
my necks it's like a creamy white lion
it-it's really really good I'm gonna use
this in the waterline
I do love a white in the waterline like
it really makes your eyes pop then I was
going to apply some mascara
so from the morphe 9c palette I'm going
to take this banana shade and we're
gonna run this down the front of my nose
where I applied that concealer is that
Fonda Martha it's thunder and
now oh my god you can get up forward
types of weapon will in one day and
you're UK it stresses me out
okay so gonna do a little bit of blush
and I did just get something Lottie
London blushes so I kind of want to try
this this is in the shade
Zayn I just think blush just makes you
look so much comfier but I never used to
wear blush but now I just love the way
it makes me look healthy I think you
know this is a nice blush okay so I'm
gonna take the sponge with the powder
and we're just gonna bake underneath my
contour cuz I want to look super
chiseled today my god can you hear that
what drives at us like I'm racing I hate
thunder excuse me when I was a kid I
used to be like if it's thunder and I'd
be like hiding under my bed like where
the hell are you basically how you like
oh my god this is really bad when I was
at school when I was in school I used to
have a teacher she was like Scouse she's
probably scales I'm not very good at
scales like 10 but she was she one time
she was having to go at me because I'm
something to do if I was using her
highlight or something I don't even know
if I like pens using whatever happens
and I don't know she was like give me
the highlights and I was like highlight

boom boom boom shake okay
 she amazing what's gonna keep
applying this I'm gonna apply some of
this highlight down the bridge of my
nose and on the end I really got the
Scouse accent I wish I could actually do

accident really like no a northern
accent max it's so boring so I'm
festival gonna line my lips with my Mac
boldly bare lip liner which is like
knees shaft and everybody lost my
sharpener I was on honey yeah absolutely
mug okay so I'm gonna pass them with the
Nick lingerie liquid lipstick in the
shade cashmere silk

they're straight affordable and that is
so good I use them all the time and what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a bit of
concealer on my finger and I'm gonna dot
