youtube channel my name is Holly beam if
you're new here nice to meet you I've
seen this sunset I look going around
Twitter Instagram and I was like damn I
really wanna do that like I really wanna
do it so this is my take on it all so
just quick make sure you subscribe if
you're not already a little cartoon me
down here to subscribe and yeah if you
want to find out how i got this makeup
look then please keep watching so I've
already done my eyebrow and I did my
shadow base off-camera I used the
Maybelline the eraser eye concealer in
the shade neutralized for my shadow base
which is a bit lighter than the one that
I use for my under-eye just because I
want light concealer so the colors would
show up better I'm going to be using
this Smashbox palettes this is the bold
eye palette and I'm first of all going
to take the yellow shade so this shade
right here this is the first show that
I'm gonna take I'm using my Mac two to
four brush and I'm gonna basically a pry
this in the crease and just above the
crease next I'm gonna take the orange
shade from this palette and I'm using my
Sigma e25 brush I'm gonna apply this in
the crease it wouldn't have a video like
if you watch my Barbie video I know the
intro was just like so much it was just
like I had to do it okay I had to do it
I just had to UM it was like you know
you're really high above you had sweets
before you filmed I'm like this is me no
more like I'm always talking just
annoying it like I'm just annoying
person I feel like you either get me we
don't you know I mean I feel that some
people just don't get me I'm being
sarcastic or I'm being like I'm messing
around and people think I'm being
serious and I'm just like I just know I
sometimes I'm like mad children
sometimes I'm sorry too
and then other times I'm just like I
don't show up he's like no in between
with me I mean for like Sochi or like
people think they're saying wrong or I'm
just like I don't stop talking now I'm
going back to that yellow
color and I'm using my Mac two to four
I'm just gonna blend out the edges next
using this same brush which is the Sigma
e25 I'm gonna go in with this red shade
here it's red feather and I'm gonna do
the same damn when I rise in the crease
but you don't want to put it all the way
over the orange because I still want the
orange to show through so I'm just gonna
fight just underneath work with the
orange
I'm gonna take my morphe M 502 and I'm
gonna put some in the orange on this
brush and just go slightly above the red
with this cuz I want the orange to still
show through I knew she'd never do voice
over video it's just purely because I
feel like I just like to talk to you
guys I'd sit here and talk I just feel
that sometimes with like voiceover
videos I I sound a bit robotic so I just
never do them I just know it's not about
that life
people like voiceover videos but I
personally as well as a viewer I want to
watch other people I don't like watching
I don't know watching voiceover videos I
find them like nice today
I preferred someone sit and talk rather
than voiceover but that's just me just
want to keep going back to the other
colors so now I'm gonna go back to the
orange and this brush and then I'll go
back to the yellow as well like you just
want to keep going back to the previous
colors just to make sure they still stay
through so now I'm going to take my it's
thick my e54 brush and I'm going to take
the purple shade so this red right here
and I'm going to apply this all over the
lid and then I'm going to take my Sigma
e25 and the red shade in the crease and
I'm gonna go back to the orange I'm
sitting on my leg and I just got pins
and needles really bad hi guys so
talking to pins and needles the other
day I went to London to get my hair done
cuz I need it redoing because I have pre
bonded hair extension
and when they grow out you have to get
them redone so had to go to London to
get my hair are you done and I was like
in their taxi on the way back to the
station and just all of a sudden like my
whole body had pins and needles and I
kind of explained like I was crying and
I was like what the is going on
like because I'm not on my own in
central London I'm like driver in
hospital I would want you to do know
what the fuck's going on and it was just
the weirdest thing and then I had some
tablets and I ate something and then it
went it was just like very weird
it was weird as I'm gonna go into
with the glitter liner and so I'm gonna
use this dazzling gel lineup from a
collection this is a glam Christmas is
silver I'm gonna use this to wing my
liner I can't talk while I do this
because I will it up so oh my god
so I'm a fat bitch and I just ate two
points of these pom bear so I I love
them so much they're so like boring in a
way like they're just plain but the
saying about them I don't know what it
is what's your favorite crisps right
down below or if you're American with
your favorite chips because I pom Bears
boring I know but like I said there's
something about them it's just something
about them it just tastes so good I
don't know what it is I do
that's enough without the UK has the
deadly selection for crisps I it's just
so dead I'm just using the Mac extended
play mascara brother and I I'm just
gonna put some black liner in my top
waterline so that when eyelashes look
okay I'm gonna use the Mac Pro Longwear
fluid line in black track one I ran out
of my Sigma gel liner and I don't think
they have any more in stock also I
checked it wasn't
on stuff in stock on the website so I
think I might get the Maybelline Joe
likes I've sent it off you'll be using
that and I used to use it with the time
I don't want to stop because it was
actually really good so I'm gonna get
that again I still actually can't
believe that have like for age and
40,000 subscribers like what the I
just find that so crazy that that many
people press subscribe to my youtube
channel like I find myself really
annoying I'm gonna use the cocoa ashes
in the styler more I haven't lost this
one today thank God oh my god if you
watched my video my Barbie tutorial I
lost an eye - half way through like we
always do it goes you know you know the
street you know the deal you lose your
eyelash and it's gone poof gone forever
I can't find it anyway
no it's my eyelash and then I put my
dressing gown on the next morning to go
downstairs and get breakfast and the
woman saved my life stuck to your ass
and I was like okay so that's where the
eyelash went and it was actually
squished just that's my mom and I was
like how did it even get there because
my dressing gown was nowhere near like
my robe was nowhere near like my shares
is it bad dad I'll never made love no
one ever seen y'all know how to up
beer bagger I'll prove it to you
oh my god I just wanna clear my eyebrow
how did I even happen okay so I'm gonna
take my the Maybelline the arrays eye
concealer and Shane neutralized so I'm
gonna apply like this on marks I'm gonna
finish off my eye makeup before I go
onto my face because I'm using this
color is because it's a lot like really
light so it shows up the colors very
well I'm gonna blend that in my 3d
render I'm just gonna set that with some
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
then I'm gonna go yellow orange red
purple just like I've done and wet the
top and where I'm reading the same on
the bottom see ya first we're going to
take the yellow
just real quick right one thing that
really bugs me is when delivery people
interview parcels and they say let you
get an email saying that you weren't in
they can leave the pass or whatever and
there having been knocked on the door
like they haven't even knocked on the
door and they say no one's here like
bitch you didn't even knock on the door
I've been here like all day how can you
say there's nobody here I don't
understand anyway
I'm gonna say it's orange I just don't
get why you just like say ol no one's in
when you haven't even knocked on at all
well delivery person are you
I don't that was anybody else but I work
from home obviously I fill my videos
here and I do a lot of work from home
yes I'm pretty much here 80% of the time
working and the amount of time that
happens like that oh no one was in and
I'm like I haven't been here all day and
I'd like know that you haven't not done
at all just gonna go into that red it's
like one of my biggest pet peeve and
they're gonna go with the pair pour on
my Sigma V 54 and I'm gonna put this as
close to the lash line as possible I'm
gonna go back to my Sigma e55 so now I'm
going to take my English eyeliner and
then shade 76 which is white and I'm
going to put this in the waterline I'm
using my Sigma yo six winged liner brush
and then I'm going to apply some mascara
to my bottom lashes I'm using the Mac
extended play mascara I'm just gonna
take a wipe and I'm gonna wipe away any
excess concealer under my eyes so not
wear them when I make up with you but
this is an excess bit here I'm going to
use the benefit Porefessional I'm gonna
apply this in the center of my face just
to minimize my pause
I'm gonna use this is a part of the
Urban Decay rehab makeup rap but the
label wiped off so it's just like a
white pop now I'm going to use some of
this because I let you love this so much
so I'm just gonna use this is my face
because it's so hydrating especially if
you're only is good because you can
still get that hydration without the oil
this isn't it contain any oil it's just
that water base it was just so nice on
the skin no but it was spray of my Mario
Badescu facial spray I like you come in
green tea those are people telling me to
get the rose water 1 but I just don't
like the scent of it I'll be honest I
just prefer the scent of this one they
both the same thing they're just
different sentence but I just prefer
this one before I apply foundation I'm
going to set my primer in my t-zone
because I've been super worried lately
like so oily so I'm gonna just set my
primer before I apply my foundation
especially my forehead and my chin has
been like really bad really oily it said
it my forehead hair gets so really so
I'm gonna flash to my chin so for my
foundation today I'm going to use the
hourglass stick foundation this if you
guys have been following me for a while
or if you haven't I used to be obsessed
with there's like so obsessed and I
stopped using it just because I just the
price of it was just ridiculous like
it's expensive you don't get much
product for your money but it is a
amazing foundation it's pure pigment
it's buildable coverage back and cakey
it's just like so gorgeous it's like a
full coverage if you want full coverage
you can build it up but I have a cup
it's like a full coverage satin finish
it's gorgeous this is such nice
foundations I don't really like stick
foundations really like I'm not really a
stick foundation kind of fan but this
one is so bomb I want to see before
coverage today so yeah and I'm just
gonna blend it in with my 3d blender by
Sigma but is your guy is a favorite
Netflix series like I love
venturi Oliver series out of a field I
love stuff like crying crying
investigate in what kind of stuff I'm
obsessed
um I'm not obsessive forensics on it so
I just I'm so obsessed of it
yeah if you can recommend anything just
say so what I think I want a really
bright under-eye today I just think I
want to I'm going to use the memory
eraser I with the one that I just used
in the shade neutralized
so mana is considered dry for a little
bit before but in the end and you get
more coverage of it
okay so again taking my 3d blender
okay so I'm going to set my under eye
then I Messier
okay so I'm just gonna bake down the
sides of my nose okay so I'm not going
to do any cream bronzer today I'm just
gonna go straight over my mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade dark deep and
reason my Mac 140s brush I'm gonna press
it in
okay so then I'm going to take my
Anastasi Beverly Hills
powder contour kit I'm gonna take the
darkest shade with the same brush and
I'm gonna apply this to contour so I'm
gonna start from with forehead I feel
like it's better to apply a bronzer
before you go in with contour so it will
just blend in a lot nicer if you go
straight in with calm so sometimes you
can kind of it just looks too obvious so
if you go for bronzer fast and then a
contour it will just blend in so much
nicer so it's easier
okay so i'm going to take my morphe r8
brush and my Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I'm gonna just carve out my
contour just to make it hello sharp so
I'm gonna like it
hello shot sometimes I like it more so
say for brush I'm gonna take my benefit
California and I'm using my Sigma small
contour brush is the fo5 this blush lip
she smells like holiday it smells I just
must say good smells I like coconut you
like some cream type of smell you know I
mean the my morphe and 500 brush I'm
gonna dust off this powder okay for go
I'm gonna mix
perla and peach fears from the Anasazi
our liquid glow
I love these two shades so I'm gonna mix
it to discover because I like the peach
tin in this one and this one's a bit
lighter so I like this one as well so
I'm gonna mix it to I'm just gonna put
some on the back of my hand
I'm gonna use my Sigma 3d render as
always I'm just gonna dip my sponge into
these and I'm going to apply them to my
cheek
and then I'm just gonna press some just
above the brow you like being
highlighted in this area just on my brow
I'm gonna fingers round the eyebrow as
well - my lip color I'm gonna use the
Mac lip liner in bold you fair I'm gonna
fill my lips with this as well and then
on top I'm gonna use the lip gloss from
NYX the butter gloss in the shade
tiramisu and then lastly to get rid of
all the excess powder on my face I'm
going to use my Mario Badescu facial
spray of aloe cucumber and goon cute and
I'm going to spray my face with this so
that is the finished look I hope you
