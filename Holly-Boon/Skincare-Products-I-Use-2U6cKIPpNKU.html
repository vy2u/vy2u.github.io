through my skincare routine type of
thing I don't tend to do this every
single day because I don't really need
to but when I feel like my skin needs a
bit of TLC that's when I'll start using
these products and but I will talk you
through what I kind of do on a daily
basis as well if you want to see a video
of me doing that then I will do that for
you guys
and but yeah I just thought I'd talk you
through sort of the deep cleansing
products and the masks and things are
that I like to use and I am NOT a
skincare Pro anything like that so I
can't really advise anything on if you
thought I really bad skin or anything I
just kind of know what's best for me but
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video
make sure you give it a thumbs up if you
enjoy it and yeah so the first product
that I want to talk about is the v2
carry oxygen
I mask and this is for all night so I've
been using this now for about two weeks
and it's amazing if you have sort of
dark under eyes or wrinkly under eyes
like me you're supposed to brine it up
and help reduce wrinkling under eyes
basically and so I've used a lot of
high-end brands before and I could
honestly say that this is just as good
and it's nowhere near as expensive so if
you don't want to spend a lot of money
and you want a really good product then
I really really recommend you getting
this and it's a basically what it says
it says I'm really bad at explaining
things I'm just going to read the back
if it says say goodbye to tired eyes
dark circles and fine lines now you can
always look refreshed bright eyed and
lively and and it says to leave this on
for 8 hours so you can make your basic
you just sleep with this on I have
actually used this I lived on for longer
than eight hours and it was fine so it's
not like a must if you're lucky to get
more than eight hours sleep and then
don't worry about rushing take it off
but yeah I'm just going to show you what
it actually looks like basically you get
six of these this is what it comes in
and you get six of these in the box and
this is what it looks like it's
basically just like a gel pad
and so they're quite wet when you take
them out it's this gel type formula what
you want to do is obviously you just put
it under your eye like that and then
sleep with it on and so yeah what you do
is when you put it on you can push it
into your skin and just then your skin
can absorb all the gel and all the nice
that's on the thing yeah I'm sorry about
explaining things but yeah that's
basically what I use and I will link
below and where I got this from because
I don't think many people know about
this product and I've asked my friends
if they've had a bit before and they've
never actually used it and I'm like oh
my god you need to try it so I will link
below for you guys where I got this from
yeah I don't say races but I want to
remove my makeup I use the Garnier
cleansing water yep
I use this and the reason why I use this
because I have very sensitive eyes and
makeup wipes sting my eyes if you have
that problem then I highly recommend
trying this because for ages and ages
ages I've even used sort of sensitive
skin my makeup wipes and it's still
we've done the same effects still
assisting my eyes so yeah I use this now
and it's not hard to get your makeup off
for this it's really really easy
I hate there's makeup wipes we have to
like rub scrub it to get it all but this
you don't do that which is amazing so if
you have sensitive skin I highly
recommend you trying this thing I like
to use is I have these two face mask is
a deep cleansing face masks so when I
fill up my skin really needs some TLC
it's feeling a bit dry or just feels
like it needs something and this Y is so
I've got one that's for all you skin
this point is the mud mask and this
one's great if you've got really oily
skin and then I've also got this one
when I've got dry skin so my skin tends
to change quite a lot and when it gets
to sort of like wintertime my skin dries
out and then summer time I said tend to
get like really really oily and but I've
kind of been quite oily at the moment
still which is kind of weird because
it's like really cold and I'm just
really so it's really red but yes and I
use temple spa products pretty much all
the time
I didn't read out anything about them
and then my mum started buying them and
I was like so I just decided to use hers
so I started using hers and I was like
oh my god they're actually so good and
the only problem is obviously they're
quite expensive but you pay for what you
get and these are so good
and they smell like amazing and as well
this pot is actually I think a she I'd
only think they're like expensive
because this pot I think is about 25 30
pounds and I've had this now since about
August and this still relies left in
there because I don't use this all the
time I kind of said you use these
probably like once a week months
sometimes like once every two weeks
depending on my skin's like but yeah
highly recommend days any of you that
follow me on Twitter or Instagram you'll
know that I am literally obsessed with
temple spa products I talk about the
mousse as high and because a lot of you
ask me skincare you've asked for several
times and I always tell you temple
spartans by sample spa so yeah I use
this temple spots hiding essence I've
just got new ones I just ran out and but
what I do is this is once I've cleaned
cleansed my skin I will then spray this
on before I moisturize it just makes
just give me for like that extra sort of
squeaky clean and it's just really
really nice but also is good for like a
rough your face first like it needs to
be a little bit refreshed it's really
nice to spray this on your face as well
and what I tend to do is get sort of
like cotton wore pads
spray this on and just wipe this over my
face when I'm trying to like extra
cleaning you can say lastly I like to
use for moisturizer I like to use this
deep moisture body lotion for dry skin
so when I had I was in hospital when it
came out of hospital because I was
drugged up on so many drugs my skin
reacted really bad and got really really
dry itchy my skin was like snake skin
and this kind of saved my life
it's just really really good it's kind
of like a deep moisturizing so it's good
if you've got really dry skin I think a
lot of doctors recommend this as well
and we've got like x-men things I think
this is good for that but yeah this is
what I use for moisturizer that's kind
of free everything that I use I don't
tend to use too many products because
I'm kind of Luckies have quite good skin
anyway like genetically my mom's always
had really good skin so I'm lucky to
just have naturally quite good skin so
yeah I think that's basically a well
that is basically everything I use so
yeah I'll link below where you can get
these products from and with flights or
chemicals risings you can email them and
sort of discuss what your skin's like
and they'll be able to recommend what's
best for you
and that face that I mask sorry and I'll
link that as well because you all need
if you've got dark circles but yeah I
hope you guys do it this video I make
sure you give it a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and also add me on snapchat
because I'm gonna do snapchat Q&amp;amp;A and so
I'll link that below so you can add me
