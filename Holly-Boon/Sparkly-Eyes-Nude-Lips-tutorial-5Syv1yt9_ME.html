semi-sweet chocolate palette by Too
Faced and I did already go in to my
crease with shade peanut butter but
apparently my camera didn't like it and
decided to delete it so now I'm going in
with shade truffled which is a darker
Brown and I'm just working that into the
crease and then applying some more to
the outer corner just to darken it up a
little bit and the brush I'm using is
the sigma e35 blending brush I am a huge
fan of this brush it just makes the
product blend really really nicely
together and it's definitely one of my
go-to is I pretty much use it all the
time
now going in with my Kiko blending brush
and with no product on the brush I'm
just going to blend those two shades
together now using my zoeva 2 to 5 brush
i'm going in with shade liquorice which
is a black I'm just applying that's the
outer corner of my eye and then I'm
going to blend that in with my Kiko
blending brush i like to do small
circular motions because i fill out this
and blends it a lot easier so basically
you just want to keep blending and so
there's no harsh lines and so just keep
blending and blending and blending until
your arm falls off basically
so now I'm governing with my mac 242
brush and I'm using the Mac reflects
glitter and this is called reflects gold
it's a really nice white glitter but it
reflects a really nice gold as it says
I'm just gonna pack that onto the I
start from the inner corner to about
half way I'm just gonna put loads and
loads and loads on because I just want
to look like a sparkly unicorn so
basically you just want to keep putting
the glitter on until you've used the
whole entire pot now I'm taking but this
is keep it in the glitter on figures you
can never have too much glitter on your
eye let's be honest now using the Rimmel
volume flash mascara I'm just going to
apply some mascara before I apply my
false eyelashes and I'm using the Sorel
UK long lash that I use all the time and
so I'm just applying them and then
applying some mascara to blend my
natural lashes in with the false ones
so I did my face makeup off camera
because you guys have seen me do it a
thousand times and I figured it would be
quite boring and now I'm just going to
move shade truffled which is the darker
brown shade I'm just using that under my
lash line and then I'm just gonna blend
that out so it's not so harsh now I'm
just applying some mascara to my bottom
eyelashes and then I'm going to go in
with my Elizabeth Arden smoky eye pencil
and I'm just gonna add some black
eyeliner into my waterline
and then finally for my lips I'm using
jarred cosmetics this is the Hydra matte
lip gloss in Aphrodite but I didn't want
to have a matte look then I'm just going
over the top of that with my mac
lipglass in c3 just to give it a glass
because I wasn't really feeling matte
lips for this look that is the finished
look I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I will see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
