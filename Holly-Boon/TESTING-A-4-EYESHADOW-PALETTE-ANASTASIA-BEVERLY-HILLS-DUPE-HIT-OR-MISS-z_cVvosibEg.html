channel if you're new hit that hello my
name is holly boon so today I'm gonna be
testing out the makeup revolution
eyeshadow palette these are only four
pounds each and after I use that
concealer I'm just so interested in that
brand now I want to test out some more
things and see what's what
like I'm just yeah obsessed so I've put
some powder underneath my eyes and I'm
just a baked in case we get any fallout
it will just piece dust it away
obviously I tried that concealer and I
was like wow concealer is so good and
I've never tried the right on a palette
so I really wanted to give them a go and
I thought that it really nice so makeup
revolution and doodoo dupes for pyrin
makeup so to me this one looks like the
subculture palette from Anastasia
Beverly Hills and this willing to put up
the modern or a nice songs for innocence
we're gonna call it and palette from
undecisive everything else as well so
let's see what they like their 84 pounds
each so I'm gonna use my makeup
revolution concealer in the shade c5
just quickly this video is not sponsored
by makeup revolution for whatever site
h-bond saying it's not sponsored
so yeah I'm gonna use my concealer in
the shade c5 - I like my eyeshadow base
I'm just gonna apply some to my lid I
have used this concealer like literally
non-stop since I got it I haven't
touched another concealer and also if
you watched my Primark a video that full
face department makeup if you happen to
go check that out and that Iroh product
is on my eyebrows now I've been using it
non-stop as well I'm honestly obsessed
so this brush is from Primark it's
really good for covering up the brows
I'm just going to go over it with my
sponge just get rid of any excess
product and it's just so much easier
yes thousand 18 I just want to try out
so many more products especially
affordable stuff haven't done much um
like affordable products on my channel
so I'm just really interested to see if
I can find good products no to you
so the eyebrow product that you know
this Primark I ran out is everything
this concealer is everything so I want
to try behind a good eyes
palate is cheaper so that's why we
wanted to do this video today we're on a
bargain hunt 2018 we're all going to
start saving money and I'm so going to
test high-end stuff but for now I just
want to see if I can find good and
expensive makeup okay sorry I'm gonna
set my lips and I'm gonna use my beauty
fakeri translucent powder at my favorite
powder of all time people have been
saying to me don't set your lids because
the shades that are brighter but
honestly it doesn't work to me and it
makes them slightly brighter I'm not not
like a huge difference and also it
creases like I should just crease it so
bad in my eyes and it's even harder to
blend I find I know Paige dawei's does
that she's done it for years
she didn't set her clients lids she just
go straight him of color and she's
amazing abundance you see how Paige's
the queen of that but me I that's a
struggle for me so picked up some NYX
and brushes I love the NYX eye brushes
they're really fluffy and again they're
not expensive
okay so from this palette I'm going to
take this shade first of all on this NYX
fluffy brush this is the number 17 I'm
gonna apply this just above my crease
very lightly because obviously I don't
know what these shutters I like so I
just want to kind of start lightly and
then build it up it's applying evenly
it's not isn't it patchy hey I don't
want to take this orange shade right
here from this brush which is the 16
brush from NYX and I'm gonna
again I'm going and really lightly and
I'm gonna build it up okay they're not
the most the most pigmented eyeshadows
but they I like to build up anyway see
I'm having to try and like dip back into
this orange one quite a bit if you're
someone who loves makeup and you just
don't want to spend loads of makeup when
you don't have the money to spend now as
a makeup then this is why I'm gonna
start doing these types of videos
because know that you guys trust my
opinion and I'm glad that you do because
I
be honest and I want to try and find
some stuff this is video for the role
and also it's like we don't if you don't
have to spend the money on expensive
stuff and we don't want to obviously I
feel like drugs are way up their game
lately
yeah these shadows are not bad at all
they're going on really nicely they're
blending well together that like I said
they're not the most pigmented so you
have to keep dipping back in so you're
just gonna have to apply more than you
would if it's like really pigmented she
just have to keep dipping back in a
little bit more but I don't mind doing
that it's not that big of a deal so I'm
just going back to this like a shame
he's fast on this brush and just blend
out the edge so far so good
it's looking good okay so I'm going to
switch to this palette now so I want to
use some shades up here I'm gonna go for
this purple color here this again is a
NYX brush this is a 15 brush so I'm
gonna dip into this purple and I'm gonna
apply this in the outer corner in the
crease and the inner corner as well so I
just switched to my morphe brush because
that brush wasn't really doing much for
me and this brush doesn't have a number
cuz I've got it in an eye brush step but
and I'll find this brush and I'll link
it below so I'm gonna get up eyes in the
outer corner bring it in the crease and
then the inner corner as well okay I'm
just gonna press the color room because
my brush is a bit wet so it's like
almost disturbing their shades
underneath now go back to the orange on
this brush in the edge cuz I don't want
to lose the orange so going back to this
purple color
I blend it up that blends really really
easily which is good
the powerful has a lot more fallout than
the other two shades as you can see so
from this palette again I'm going to set
this darker purple shade and I'm just
going to prize on the outer core and the
inner corner of the eye and I'm going to
use this same brush from morphe I'm just
gonna press this on rather than Rob and
I should have really used a smaller
brush but I couldn't find them so this
one's gonna have to do
so just keep living back to this dark
color to build it up make it a bit
darker and you do get a lot of fallout
with the dark look at that
use my revelation concealer in the shade
c5 I'm gonna cut my crease just in this
end up I'm using my prymaat brush
you
you want to go just slightly above your
crease good he's doing it to show up you
don't want to go in the crease just want
to get litchi slightly above his head
this flat brush from next which is this
14 brush and I'm going to use this
greening shimmery shade here which is
definitely like the one from the
subculture palette see I'm going to
apply this on top of that concealer
so I'm going to take this brush which
has that dark shade I'm just gonna go
over that line just to diffuse it
because you don't want to a harsh line
this is actually more like a foiled
shadow rather than like a shimmer I
thought it was gonna be like a sumo but
just looks more like a foiled when you
put on the lid and the texture and stuff
Azhar it's quite a creamy shadow okay
again I'm going to take this brush and
just diffuse the edge on both sides
okay so I actually think that has come
out quite well this one looks a little
bit messy but I think that I looks
better so I'm gonna line my lashline I'm
gonna use the Maybelline the lasting
drama Joe lioness is one of my favorites
actually and I haven't used this in
forever I'm going to just use the little
brush that comes with there
so I nearly didn't bake my undereyes I'm
sure when have that much ruled out good
you're dead so I'm just gonna dust off
this powder and this fallout from under
my eyes get rid of that see as long as
you bake onto your eyes and you do I
soloed in the ring Matt if you get full
one out because you just dust it off and
it's gone so I'm going to use my
favorite ashes of all time should the
Koko lashes in the start or more you can
get these from false eyelashes Cody at
UK and I think they're about seven
pounds and I get so many wears out of
them I actually wear the same pair I
just clean them and I've reused them
literally so many times like 30 times
they've got a really strong band which I
like and I'm gonna use my house of
lashes eyelash glue again my favorite
eyelash whatever it's the only one that
ever sticks my lashes but I'm going to
leave those ashes to dry down for a
little bit
you want to make sure they dry a little
bit so they're a bit tacky stick them on
and I'm gonna finish off my under eye
I'm gonna go first of all to the
transition color that I use for this
pinky color on this fluffy brush just
underneath my eye then we're gonna go
through the orange do the same thing
dad I'm gonna take the dark purple shade
here on this little brush which is the
NYX 15 brush
it's going to take some translucent
powder Enders Newt you're not at the
side because it looks a bit messy we're
doing the same inside just leave that
there for a little bit I'm gonna apply
some mascara to my top lashes before I
apply it and this is just the Rimmel
extreme black volume flash Muslera I
used to use this at school and I'm just
gonna put some of this Joel I know I
forgot and went up wore it on because
otherwise my lashes they'll be like a
little gap I'm just gonna bend these
lashes a little bit just till a man so
stiff when I go to stick them when I
my lashes are low for a sec just to dry
and the eyelash glue will dry clear I'm
just going to leave them alone
and I'm just gonna finish up my face
makeup I might as well just do it on
camera because we're filming so I'll
just finish it off with you guys here
I'm just going to quickly go over my
eyebrows this is the pencil from Primark
which was literally two pound and it's
just they're like good it's a prowess no
it's good so good but someone's I get
powder in my brows and they start to
look a bit gray so just to go over them
I might brush with some Mario Badescu
spray and I'm gonna use my car I'm not
gold rush palette I'm going to use this
shade because this gave me a beaming
highlight the other day so good
highlight in this palette so creamy and
I'm going to take this one which is the
radiant glow highlighter in the shade
moonlight beam from Primark again and
I'm gonna put it over the top the gold
run is more creamy than this one so I
like the gold underneath fit I like this
one cause it really lines up and also
from this palette I'm gonna use is blush
I'm gonna put some mascara on my top
lashes just a little bit and then I'm
gonna just apply some to the bottom
lashes I'm gonna use this um smudge
proof insta go kiss proof lipliner from
Primark in the shade okay he doesn't say
does it say what Shay that's 9
when you use this glutton framework
again which is the peach one and this
was like a pound and I love this so nice
just gonna spray my face with some very
bitter skin spray so my overall thoughts
on this palette is their bond they're
four pounds each look I'm only shade you
get four four pound it's blended really
really nicely they run it together
they're not the most pigmented but you
can build it art which is good
and you do get loads of foot bath I see
any problem so make sure that you put
powder under your eyes or you do your
eye makeup before you do your face
makeup but honestly for four pounds each
I think they look I think it looks
amazing obviously I haven't used all of
the shades but the darker shades seem to
have more fallout than the lighter
shades and this shade here is so nice
it's really creamy and really foil which
is the shade that I used in the center
of my eye and I'll just do another
little swatch of my fingers you can see
what they're just it's just really
creamy I'm really nice four pounds each
and I think they're really good so yes
that yes till that is a really nice they
do loads of pallets in there like loads
these ones stuff that you caught my eye
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
