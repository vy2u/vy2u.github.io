channel so if you're new here please
subscribe I'll love you forever and I
say that in every video but I will help
you forever
he's grown anyway so today we're gonna
be testing a boo through makeup so I
have teamed up with boo hoo for this
video that does not mean that my opinion
is gonna be any different - if it was
normal
my opinion is still gonna be 100% ro you
know me I always keep 100 and see ya I
have turned out the products I've got on
my face at the minute I'm actually a
little bit sure I'm not gonna lie so I
have a discount code it was just Holly
xx I'll link it in the description box
below C if you want to find out about
the products and how I did this makeup
look then keep on watching so we're
gonna start with the face today um are
we know maybe we should start with the
eye shadow fighting cases got fallen out
so this is the eyeshadow palette from
boohoo
I already swatched a few of these shades
on my hand when I've got it and I was
like a little bit shook actually these
shimmer shades are quite pigmented which
I didn't expect
so the price of this is so this
eyeshadow palette is 10 pounds get eight
shades and it's 10 pounds we're going to
try it out see what it's like and yeah
so I'm gonna first we'll take this shade
on my fluffy brush I'm going to apply
the shade in the crease and we're going
to try this palette and see what we
think okay so it's definitely pigmented
so far it's working out we're gonna do
the same on the other side so it has
only got to match shades I thought like
it could have like maybe a couple more
matte shades in the last shimmers - is
my personal preference now I want to use
this grayish color which is the other
much shade in the palette so this shade
right here and I'm going to place the
outer view of mine halfway in
I bet you like a huge variety of looks
because there are only two matte shades
but cute little palette anyway okay so I
see all the shades bring together
they're blending together quite nicely
so I did get white now since time when I
got shorter and I think I liked it so I
always got why on my toes I just went to
match someone's got a little bit think
about that I thought I might taste much
my fingernails I don't know why I don't
know how long it's gonna stay white for
okay so I'm gonna cut my crease with
some concealer huh and I'm going to
apply one of the shears
I'm just gonna go over the edge with a
bit of the pink first of all I just want
to make sure that it's blended our we
don't know line so go with the pink
first and then I'm gonna go with the
gray purple color for the shimmer on the
lid I don't know which quality is I like
a lot of these you might be quite cute
I'm going to make sure this one and this
one okay so I'm feeling this like this I
think if you're a beginner eye shadow
this is gonna be great Fuchs is really
inexpensive and it's good it's a good
poet
so I've stuck some rashes on off-camera
because boo hoo to her blushes I had a
tiny bit of fallout on this eye but
overall not much fallout so that's quite
good but I'm really impressed with the
eye shadow I really like it's in Rio's
update their iPhone and now I'm just I
don't even now sweat my phone because
Sony and I'm just confused they just
don't like it anyway so I'm next got
these boohoo illuminating primer and
this is six pounds on the website so
just gonna put it where this in the back
of my hand okay looks like a moisturizer
so can creamy oh it's a bit like Odessa
okay so it's not nothing illumination it
feels like a moisturizer but it is a
little bit sticky yeah here's a little
bit sticky I would definitely say it's
illuminating so that's good says does
what it says so is good isn't it
sorry they send me these two sponges
which come in a pack and you get two
sponges for four pounds they come in
this little box I've just stamped them
because I always dump my sponges they
are a little bit hard so I don't know
how I'm gonna feel about this because I
like a really soft sponge but I'm gonna
see how this works anyway so you don't
have foundation or concealer so yeah
these products aren't gonna be from
boohoo I'm gonna see how I feel about
these sponges I mean two sponges for
four pounds is cheap because a
Beautyblender is about 16 pounds for one
sponge so be honest see house works out
I'm going to use one for cream 1/4 power
dry like I always do
okay so this sponge is a bit hard send
me harder than a beauty render it's not
the softest but I'd say the only good
thing about this is that it doesn't
absorb as much product because it's not
as soft so I mean it's not eat enough as
a product I feel like it's kind of like
as hard as that the real techniques
sponge so if you use the Real Techniques
sponge and you're like this one is gonna
conceal
I'm gonna use the same sponge and I'm
just gonna press this in she feel like
this is better off under the eyes
because it doesn't take away any of the
products and what I find sometimes with
my feet Renda is that if I use that
sponge under my eyes he eats up the
product and then like my dark circles
still show through where's this I feel
it because it's harder he's actually
kind of better I perfectly under I
definitely okay so I'm going to use this
black one this other Spanish to set my
under eye okay honestly I'm not obsessed
with the sponge for the skin
further spine is just for the under eye
I don't it's not really working for me
for the skin it's too hard right so
let's just finish up my under eye so I'm
gonna take the pink on to the UI first
then I'm gonna take this brush and I'm
take a dark side so I've just put some
mascara on and now we're going to do
bronzer so next we're going to use this
bronzer palette which is six pounds on
the website and I'm just gonna take a
big fluffy brush and I'm going to use
Percival this shade right here I think
it's probably not going to be the right
shade for me it's pretty a bit too light
well I'm going to try anyway
okay definite think that bronzer looks
nice I I thought I'd be too light but I
actually really liked it so I'm gonna
take this show
who's gonna contour
I say I'm going to sharpen up my concern
we'll take the sponges and powder
if you want to highlight pilot from boom
here which 6-pound personally the only
show that's pretty gonna work for me is
this shade and it's pretty still gonna
be a little bit too light so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to mix it with
this shade out of the bronzer palette in
the middle here this we've got this
shade as well which is really nice so
I'm gonna just mix a bit of the two it's
like a really nice formula
I just think boo who can come up with
more shade yeah so just want them to
come up with more shades be honest I did
it some of these liquid vinyl lipsticks
as well do you really want to try this
color I really like it somewhere tries I
think this is more like a glove
other words look too much I'm really
impressed I really like the eye makeup
we like the lips the highlights nice
they just need more shades the bronzer
and the contour looks good
that's quite I'm quite sure come on
guys I'm letting you try this boo hoo
vitamin-enriched makeup setting spray I
always get scared to spray setting
sprays on my face but I've never tried
them because they can let you ruin your
makeup so it's good and if it's set my
makeup I'm not gonna know I'm ready
until the end of the day it's got a
scent to it and I can't explain the
scent I'm gonna people when it comes to
inexpensive makeup I do get a bit
worried just because um I've tried a lot
of inexpensive make on receiver like
giving me a reaction it's just not what
ever worked out for me that well I do
find bits here and there that I love but
it is a struggle for me to find
affordable makeup that I actually like
so I'm rushing I'm sure there's no shots
about this video I went in open-minded
of my eye makeup looks I snatch almost a
star Schumer looks nice it's been
discovered really well I love the way
the bronzer came out I love the way the
contours come out the highlight again
here we just need more shades for the
highlight okay
I mean more shades for the contour and
we need some more shades with the
bronzer the liquid vinyl or re nice I
applied this one and I just mix it in my
liner and I really love the finish looks
really nice with this sponge you get two
for four pounds which is so affordable
but with the sponge I personally would
love it for the under eye to blend out
the concealer because it doesn't take
away any product because it's not a
really soft sponge it doesn't absorb all
my products I really like it for the
under eye but for the face overall I
just feel like it's maybe a little bit
too it's just too hard it's not soft
enough for me that's me personally but I
said if you like the Real Techniques
sponge I feel like that's kind of like
the same sort of hardness as the Real
Techniques sponge
