channel and hello if you're new here hi
welcome so in today's video I'll be
testing out some fake makeup which I
port of ebay of course I'm an assassin
Beverly Hills huge Beauty morphe we've
got some NARS some Kylie Jenner some
Kylie cosmetics some Too Faced
so we're gonna try it all out and we're
gonna see what happens and I've got some
products to compare it to I have some of
the real stuff so I'm going to show you
what they look like what the difference
is I am a bit nervous because I thought
and what's in this stuff like I don't
know what chemicals are in this stuff so
I am a little bit nervous but we're
gonna see anyway let's just let's just
crack what the videos the first thing I
picked up with some dip brow pomade from
Anastasia Beverly Hills and this I do
believe was like 2 pound of ebay and
yeah I picked up the shade evany which
is the shade I used to use ages ago I
don't really use different women anymore
but they didn't really have any other
eyebrow products this is my real one and
this one is the fake one so I say the
difference in the packaging on the front
is that this one is the real one is a
bit more rose gold the symbol and this
one's like a little bit more silvery so
I with this one this one's in dark brown
and this one's an ebony I couldn't find
my ebony pomade from undecisive
everything else I twenty-four my dark
brown one I did pick this one up in
evany which is the fake one but yeah so
also with that it came with this brush
which is obviously a fake brush as well
so we're gonna try this and BA get the
small angled brush would you get with
the Anastasio brush and then this booty
on the end so I'm going to try this out
we're going to see what it looks like
how it feels this is very dark like
everybody from Anasazi above the hills
the row one is not the start this is
like almost black this is almost like
eyeliner wow this is dark
I would do the ribbon on this side but
the real ones in dark brown what
happenes so it's gonna look stupid I
mean I'd say the UH Nastasia formula is
a bit thicker and a bit more pomade II
this is a little bit more like a gel or
rather than a pomade this product is not
as easy to control as the pomade because
it isn't of hormone it's literally a gel
so the next product that I bought off
eBay is the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade ginger I have the
original shade here so this is the
original NARS radiant creamy concealer
in the shade ginger so you can tell
straight away that the colors are
completely different
this one is darker and a lot more warmer
and that want you to expect very very
light that one looks very light say the
packaging feels the exact same like at
the top bit it feels the same the NARS
the rule NARS one feels a little bit
heavier this one feels a little bit more
like that top one is the real one and
the bottom one is the fake one and
they're both supposed to be the show
ginger so that's definitely not the
shade ginger this is way too light so
I'm going to use this to carve out my
brows and on my lids just from putting
it on my skin on the back of my hand I
can tell already that it's way more
worried than the original I use the
original of this on this side so you can
see the difference so as you can see
just from looking like they're
completely different colors this one's
way more warm when way darker yeah as
well with this one is nowhere near as
like watery as this one I'm gonna
actually just wipe this off and put the
fake one on because we're gonna do a
shadow at home so you want it to look
the same so I'm gonna just wipe this up
I just wanted to show you the difference
actually on the skin I did pick up a
fake modern Renee Suns palette from
Anastasia Beverly Hills so this is the
fake one my real one is so trashed like
I look sure you have so many things on
this because I used it I use it so much
so I do have a lot of stains in it and
it's been through hell and back but yeah
this is a fake one this is the real one
the back of the palettes look pretty
much the same they both have the same
brighten on them apart from this one has
a serial number here you also do get the
little
as well which you get with the Anastasio
palettes and this is definitely a lot
bigger than the one that you get in the
original the bristles are a lot longer
again this is a longer brush the Anasazi
one is quite small and dense and this is
like quite long the top one is the
original and the bottom one is the fake
one I don't see a huge amount of
different scenarios I'd say the shade
realgar the original one is way more
orange we're gonna do one side with the
fake on one side with the brow and we
will see the difference I didn't get a
second powder I ordered a little remote
see a powder but you can comment on them
so I'm just going to use my own powered
I'm just using some of the patrick Star
hold on I'm just gonna put that on my
lids I always hate the show but orange
from the fake palette and I'm gonna put
this just above my crease
okay so that's the shade bird orange
which looks more reddish than the
original so on this side I'm going to
take my blank canvas cosmetics Eve 42
brush and I will take the shade but
orange again from the original palette
so buttery from in this palette
so yeah in the original palette the
burnt orange is a burnt orange whereas
in the other one who looks way more like
red from the fake palette I'm gonna take
this shade of red ochre you see right
here I'm gonna put this right in the
crease this is the same brush I used for
the transition color I feel like it's
starting to irritate my eyes I'm gonna
go back to the shade burnt orange on
this fluffy brush that comes with the
fake palette and I'm gonna use that on
the edge okay so we're gonna go back to
the real palette I'm going to take the
same shade red ochre on this exact same
brush of the e42 I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna put that right in the crease the
shade red ochre in the real one is
definitely darker more of a darker shade
than in the fake one a fake one it's
more pink from the fake one I'm going to
take the shade antique bronze this shade
right here and I'm going to apply this
to the outer corner of the eye and
despite when I feel like I really have
to dig my brush in pick up any shadow
okay so the shade antique bronze in the
real one is not actually a matte shade
which I didn't realize I'm gonna take
the shade Cypress umber which is this
shown here and I'm gonna use this shade
instead because yeah in the real one
that's not my shade again I'm really I'm
just swell my brush in the shadow and
the fake one okay then I'm gonna take
the same shade from the real one just
here red tops them off because you get a
lot pigment with this palette and again
I'm gonna put it in the outer corner
fellow pilots you just like put the
shade and it's blended away like went
over the new days when she's gone and
and yeah in the real one it's very
pigmented the shade site press on bar
from the real one is way pick weight got
really pigmented and it's still there
when you blend it I put on this side
bending here and it's gone so yeah so
I'm gonna just try some of the food
shades so and we're do the raw side
first I'm gonna use the shade primavera
just a shader
going to put this on the lid on this is
the real palette I'm going to wipe this
brush clean and when you use the same
brush for the other side and the fake
Kylie I'm going to take the exact same
shade which is here which doesn't feel
the same it's all the texture it wasn't
pretty different it's also a different
color it's actually a little bit Warner
in this fake palette okay so with the
fake one I'm gonna try and build up this
CAI little bit on the outer corner again
because it's just like not working okay
yeah and it she bends away to nothing
I have just got a real mascara I do buy
a fake one so I'm just gonna apply some
to my lashes I did pick up some fake you
nubira lashes so we're gonna see the
difference with these as well they're
not the same style but I want to just
compare at the packaging and stuff so
the top one is the fake one and the
bottom one is the real wine the
difference in the packaging is the top
one just looks a bit more yellow and a
bit more rough like the packaging is
completely different the bottom one is
occurs plastic cover whereas this is
just like cardboard so in the fake you
to beauty I picked up the style Brigitte
which looks completely different online
to be honest okay yeah okay so I'm not
even a sausage to dry for a bit before I
stick them on we're gonna start on my
face makeup so I picked up a fake
two-faced hangover primer I'll be honest
the packaging looks very very similar I
don't have my original one I don't
really like the hangover prior but this
is the only fake poem that I could find
so the packaging looks very similar it
looks exactly like the real one I would
say packaging wise there was pretty
similar you also get the pump so missing
the back my hat warm okay this smells it
smells very strong oh my god yeah this
smells very chemically really strong
okay definitely doesn't smell like the
to face one the two-faced one smells
really nice I think it's
to be coke nah I'll just carry on and if
my face starts to hurt we have to take
it off but okay so I then picked up the
Mac Studio Fix fluid foundation this is
the only foundation I could find I
picked up the shade NC 4x that's the
trade that I normally use in the real
one when I'm tanned so here I have the
real one here I have two fake one the
shades are completely different this NC
40 and the real one this and C for the
fake one I think they haven't filled the
whole thing up in this one on the map
original the writings in black this
writings in silver and the top feels
pretty similar but yeah I'm going to do
one side original one side fake I'm just
gonna put it on the side of my face
so the Studio Fix the original one is a
full-coverage it's not like a completely
matte foundation I'll say sucker semi
matte foundation and it also smells nice
I like the smell of the matte
foundations it's gonna go and wash this
sponge and I'll be back okay so I'm
gonna pour some of the fake one on the
back of man
he smells like now varnish remover oh my
god are you actually drinking it smells
so bad
it smells like acetone like you know
when you go to the nail shop and you get
your critics removed I swear you smells
like okay there's eyebrows stuff does
not dry down okay this that is a lot
more jewelry than this side and the Mac
Studio Fix fluid is not doing
foundations hey I'm gonna use the NARS
radiant creamy concealer from earlier so
the fake one on this side which is the
shade ginger which is not the is
hey ginger what I'm scared about Fitness
unwise and it really is the original on
this side isn't the original for my
forehead down my nose okay I'm gonna
blend out the fake side birth oh oh
we're going to slap the fake one a nut
smells so bad oh god okay so that's the
fake one
and it very share I does not read any
coverage so as you can see the original
you get way more coverage I'm gonna just
stick these eyelashes on real quick I'm
going to step with just my normal power
dog because I don't have a second part
of this fake so I'm just gonna use my
Patrick Starr Mac how long I then picked
up a fake console care they have a lot
of fake Anasazi baby hair stuff so
they're trying to rip Anasazi off which
is nothing and this is the fake one
Mayra one used it so much especially
 but this is the shades of friends
the top one is the real one the bottom
one's a fake one and so you've got the
same banana shade this shade is slightly
lighter than that one is this a chinois
nope that's a mountain or shimmer that's
your shimmer and then in the bottom row
you've got this cool tone shade in the
real one which is good for like it's
good to console with and it's kind of in
different order so you've got that shame
pretty much there and then at those two
shades look pretty similar not far off
so I'm going to use this brush on this
side and when here's the dark shade here
so I'm just gonna go forehead I kind of
use this more like a bronze or rather
than to contour I don't really contour
with it and on this other side I'm gonna
use this brush from NYX and I'm gonna
use that shade in the middle there
it looks very like red this side you can
see is very not bronze whereas this side
looks very red okay these lashes are not
even stuck on what better way to stick
down I'm just getting pissed off so I
don't count on my fret I I started to
sting on this side like it just feels
very sensitive I've ordered a
highlighter fading common time so we're
gonna skip highlight we're gonna go
straight to lips so I've got this Kylie
cosmetics lip kit in the shade dirty
peach so yeah you get the liner and the
liquid lipstick whoa
liner is brown and the liquid lipstick
is pink like a bright thing it was a red
streak of something in here and oh my
 oh my god that smells so bad oh
 that smells so bad because quiet
kids normally smell like candy like it's
no really nice that smells so bad
because the lip pilot is supposed to be
this peachy brown color and it comes up
pink
okay then I'm going to apply the liquid
lipstick oh god this is definitely not
the shade dirty bitch this is pink oh my
god
the chemicals are so bad I kind of is
and willips is so bad I feel weird and
why let us know what pronoun that is so
bad do not buy fake Kylie lip kiss
please do not buy them I don't know what
the is in this that is so strong
and I put on my lips and it just felt
like my lips are swelling up so also
picked up with fake jaclyn hill palettes
I really would see what it would look
like basically and so my original one is
here is pretty dirty I use it a lot I
love this palette it's one of my
absolute favorites so this one is I
think supposed to be like her new
packaging the more shiny stuff and for
here's the inside so what Wow
one's broke so that's that this was just
literally all fell out on me
great so this is the fake one and this
is the real one so this is the real one
this is the fake one the greens are
different the yellow here there's no
yellow at the top so over neutral shade
this the colors in is art to me
completely different to the original
like completely different in the fake
one in the fake one is he a Booker
bright yellow here and in the original
there's no bright yellow at all the
greens at the bottom ah maybe a tiny bit
similar but really not really and
they've got this bronze eagle here which
is more like a reddish brown kind of
gold in the original and then they put
this shimmery yellow here which is not
like that in the palette so it's more of
am just a normal go so this is the real
one
so this is everyone there's no you
Oh up here it's really hard for me to
show you side-by-side because my lens is
not wise enough ah yeah you guys can see
the difference I'm just gonna say
straight up do not buy fake makeup don't
 buy it just don't buy it you can
get really good makeup at the drugstore
now you've got some really good brands
are really coming through with
eyeshadows and stuff buy that don't go
and buy a fake like this because
one you don't know what's in it
my eye is starting to stay I'm gonna
take it off because I'm really just a
condo oh just do not buy a fake makeup
it's just not worth it you don't like I
said you don't know what's in it my eye
is starting to sting now I have really
sensitive eyes as it is I don't know why
deciding this very good idea and the
brow pomade is literally like a gel
liner it's not it's not a pomade at all
most of the shade evan is very dark it's
literally black whereas with the anasazi
one it's very very very very very dark
brown but it's not black and the
foundation smells like acetone it smells
like nail varnish remover it smells so
bad
Kylie lip kit literally made my lips
feel like it was swelling up but that is
awful I don't have what the is in
that but that is so bad so bad
um yeah overall I'll just say just just
a void my copy not quiet and yeah
I'm gonna go and pens my face and just
was really sensitive so I'm gonna go
cleanse my skin I hope you guys enjoyed
