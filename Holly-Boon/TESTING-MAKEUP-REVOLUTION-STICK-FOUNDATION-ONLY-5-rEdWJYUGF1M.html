channel and hello hi welcome if you're
new here my name is Holly Boone so in
today's video I'm gonna be testing out
the makeup revolution foundation sticks
I asked you guys on Twitter what you
would prefer more of a first impressions
testing video or more of a in-depth
review so use it for a few weeks and
then let you know but those of you were
saying you wanted the video now so you
weren't in first impressions which is
fine so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to test out the foundation and I'm
going to leave it on all day and then
come back and show you guys what it
looks like I've got a few shades here so
I've got f10 f11 and f12 because I
didn't know what shade I wouldn't need
these foundation sticks are only 5
pounds there are only 5 pounds 5 pounds
that's crazy
that's so good and I usually like this
packaging it feels really nice
I like the news with the rose gold love
that so yeah 3 shades here and I'm just
gonna watch them on my face we can see
which shade I need to use and so I'm
gonna do f10 first this one okay so
that's f10 which is maybe slightly too
light but it's the right undertale feel
like and then I'm gonna just do a f11
next to it
okay so f11 is maybe more of that pinky
undertone you can see and then I'm gonna
do f12 okay after I was quite dark okay
so as you guys can see this is f10 f11
f12 f10 is slightly too light for me I'd
say and but I feel like it's the right
undertone this middle one here is more
of a peachy pinky undertone this f11 and
then f12 again it's the right under time
but it's definitely too dark so what I
think I want to do is probably mix
f12 of f10 to do like a little bit of
both because I definitely feel like that
would work because f11 is definitely the
wrong undertone so just from just
watching that on the skin I can tell
that it's very creamy it's very creamy
formula and so what I am going to do is
I'm going to set my primer because as
you guys know I am slightly oily so I do
want it to last all day I'm gonna use
cream foundation stick foundations
anything like that that it's gonna slide
around I always set my primer I'm gonna
first apply primer I'm going to use my
Marc Jacobs remarkable coconut primer
and I'm going to use this because I
needs using up and doing a little bit
left and I just want to use up because
it's hella expensive and I'm just yeah I
don't need to go update I want to get up
you know so I'm gonna apply this to skin
so yeah I cannot believe that this
foundation stick it's only five pounds
I've been meaning to test it out the
reason why I did it is because I felt
like I've tested so many sick
foundations I did want you guys to be
like oh I don't stick foundations you
know any but loads have you said you
wanted the videos so I'm excited to be
filming it
see ya like I said I am going to set my
primer this is what I do with all of my
stick foundations I always set my primer
and whenever I use really creepy formula
because it does not stay on my skin all
day it was slide around and it won't
last so I'm gonna take my Patrick Starr
Mac powder and I'm just gonna take this
Real Techniques brush and I'm gonna just
apply some powder all over my face just
a really light amount I'd read it when I
play too much because you probably too
much it will look really cakey
underneath the foundation so I'm just
gonna go for a little bit this also
helps minimize your pores if you have
quite large pores you should put some
power dial where your pores up before
you apply your foundation and it makes a
lot of difference especially use like a
pore filling primer as well and then you
do that
your pores will be invisible okay that
is so then we're gonna apply the
foundation so I am going to use f10 and
f12 I'm going
use more of f10 because it's not too
much lighter than my skin and f12 is
quite dark so I'm definitely don't buy
more f 10 I'm just going to apply this
to the skin f10
just a few a few lines around my head
and then I'm gonna apply some F 12 as
well but not too much maybe just a
little bit okay so I'm gonna bring this
in with my sponge and cleese my sponge
most of the time so I'm gonna wipe this
into the skin using the sponge okay the
good thing about this formula is it's
not hard to blend in it's invented and
very easy it's not drying down really
fast which is good because I'm moms with
stick foundations once you applied it it
dries on so fast you don't have any time
to work with the product what I feel
like this one is absolutely fine in
regards to that the coverage is pretty
good I would probably add a tiny bit
more in this little area here but the
coverage is nice it doesn't say how many
grams of product you get in here on the
website I couldn't find where it said so
I'm not sure how many grams of product
you get okay it's working into the skin
really really nicely really nicely and
it's sitting well it feels good doesn't
it feel like heavy and it feel cakey so
far so good and like I said it's not
drying down fast which is good so you
have time to work with the product it's
definitely more on the jewy side finish
wise it doesn't seem to be drying down I
do look quite shiny at the moment but
obviously I'm going to powder and stuff
but yeah it's definitely more nigiri
sides foundation I'm going to apply some
more of the f10 which is the lighter
color and just going away a bit more
coverage is here
okay so it's buildable it's definitely
buildable to have really full coverage
because I just built it up in the area
and it's covered really well so you can
definitely build it up so I'm going to
do the window my concealer and stuff I
have got some shades here that I'm going
to use a cream bronzer and we're gonna
get tryout for that as well so I'm gonna
first of all do my concealer I'm going
to first we use my backer brightening
corrector because I really like to use a
correct underneath my concealer just
because my dark circles have been
showing through my concealer recently
especially as I get much sleep this
correct oh it's just the lifesaver
because then you won't get that good dog
circle show for your casino which can
sometimes you can see a look a bit
Ashley in a bit grey where your dark
circles are showing and it's quite
sticky formula which I quite like
because I put up the casino when you
layer on top really sticks to the
corrector which I like so I'm just gonna
run this in with my sponge gonna press
it in so my sponge is done then I'm
going to apply some my makeup revolution
consider to find in the shade c5 if this
product runs out really fast for you
which it does for me and take the
stopper out a few people taught me on
Twitter to take the stopper out and you
get more product and you do so yeah if
yours is running out fast to do that cuz
my own ones are fast so I'm gonna take
my sponge and just press it in I do
believe this concealer is four pounds
yeah I'm pretty sure it's four pounds I
think it's great that the foundation
sticks and the concealers have such a
huge shade range I think that's really
good especially because we love
affordable good makeup that is also
increasing that is the goal that's
blended in reading I see with the
foundation they won't really work
together because I do look very shiny at
the moment because this is quite do
finish and but I'm not gonna say it
so I want to try this for cream bronze
us so we have got the shade ff13 so I'm
gonna give this a go so I'm just going
to apply it like I normally do I don't
if you guys can tell but I feel like I
look a little bit actually like run here
I don't know if it's because I maybe
didn't apply enough of the darker shade
I applied too much of the light shake
because sometimes if you applied too
much of a foundation crud that's too
light for you you can end up looking out
that blended in so easy well and this
formula is very very creamy maybe a
little bit too creamy for me because of
my skin type I'm just gonna see how it
was okay so I'm going to set my under I
will use my Patrick Starr Mac powder and
my Beauty Blender I really like this
power die it feels so lightweight I
think it doesn't even feel like you've
applied powder to the skin it initially
melts into the skin you don't even throw
it you're wearing any powder okay I'm
going to set all the way around my mouth
my chin my forehead my nose definitely
gonna set one is because not even I lost
my nose otherwise and ran out my Beauty
bakery powder I need to order some more
but it's always seems to me out of stock
in translucent
so annoying so I'm gonna set the rest of
my face because I know if I don't this
foundation is not gonna last on me so
I'm going to use my Mac this is the
medium plus Studio Fix perfecting powder
I'm gonna pick up some of my brush I'm
just gonna apply this to the rest of my
face because yeah it's definitely not
gonna last on me facts if I don't do
this okay so the next thing I'm going to
do is apply someone must clean your eyes
to get finish in the shade top deep I'm
just gonna again this is another powder
I'm just going to rise
on top of why I applied that cream
bronzer this is my next brush NYX 21 use
all the time
love it love it okay so I just finished
my face off camera but so far I am gonna
wear this all day and then when I come
back I'm gonna see what it looks like
but my thoughts at the moment I thought
it's potentially from my skin type
because I am oily in my t-zone I have
combination skin I don't know if this is
gonna last all day on me I have set my
whole face and I still feel like I look
a little bit shiny here I'm just gonna
powder some more because I really need
to I really want this to last but if you
if you've got dry skin I think you
absolutely love this it's a very very
very creamy formula and creamy and
obviously punishes that I've that I've
used before I'm just gonna give it all
day and I'm gonna come back I'm gonna
see what it looks like I think it's
great that is 5 pounds I think that's
absolutely amazing I think it's great
they have so many shades
yes so I'll be back in about 7 hours
time and then we can see what it looks
like so I always see them well for you
would be like 2 seconds maybe 7 hours
hey guys I'm back and it's been almost
six hours I forgot I've got an
appointment I need to go to so yeah
sorry it was at 7 hours but it's nearly
6 been 6 hours and I'm actually a little
bit shocked because the reason why is
because I really didn't think this was
gonna last and just because the formula
is so creamy irie didn't think it was
gonna stay on my face I put him to sleep
beside around it would kind of wear off
a certain patches and stuff but I don't
actually think it looks bad at all
and we've got a little bit of creasing
going on here which I'm just gonna
smooth out ba and I've got a little bit
creature nerve but I get creasing that
all the time as you guys know every
single time I wear foundation I get
creases and my lips took a hot mess
because I can't eat in a drink and we
just fix up because my overall thoughts
are that if you are oily you need to set
it like I said because I am a little bit
oily I've set it I
really don't you think it looks bad so I
haven't really got any shiny areas maybe
a little bit shiny in my forehead but
nothing too crazy you can build up to a
full coverage I say it's like a medium
coverage we can burn up to a full
coverage I say the finish is more on the
Jewish side if you are a dry skin you're
pretty gonna absolutely love this
product and like I said if you are oily
set your primers set your foundation so
if you are really oily and you have
tried this foundation already then
please comment in the comment section
below and just let me know your thoughts
let everyone else know your thoughts and
what you think if you're really oily
because I am in that middle bit I'm not
really and I'm dry I'm combination skin
I'm oily in my t-zone and the rest of my
face is pretty normal but yeah / I'm
actually very impressed I think it came
out really nice it lasted really well
which I like I said I'm very shocked may
I hope you guys enjoyed this video

this foundation and your thoughts
