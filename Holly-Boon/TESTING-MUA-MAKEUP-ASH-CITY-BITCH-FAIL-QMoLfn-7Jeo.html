channel and hello welcome if you're new
here my name is Holly boons so in
today's video I'm going to be doing a
full face of makeup Academy makeup so
when super dry gonna picked up a load of
stuff so we're gonna see what it looks
like okay so I picked up this brow
pencil and it's in the shade brunette
this was the darkest color that they has
also and they do do
dip like dip brow pomade but they're all
really warm so they were not going to be
suitable for my eyebrows at all because
I have very cool tone blueish back hair
so it was willing to work
yeah don't normally use pencils like
this and all me is like the twisty one
that got from Primark that kind of
friends so I prefer it but we'll try
this anyway okay this is really creamy
which is nice it's not like stiff or
anything I did think the column might
still be a bit water is a product really
a lot of product goes I'm really easy
but it is quite harsh maybe a little bit
too hard from my liking so I then picked
up the cover and conceal in this really
light shade they literally have no
shades which is so bad they let you have
this and a pink one that is it but is it
she it so yeah she's got like a really
small dose applicator I'm gonna use this
on my lids this looks like pure white
like I've just put pure white on my eye
it's also like very sheer it's that it's
like no coverage at all I don't know
someone's only two shades likewise
already this shade in a pink shade what
the fuck just have such high
expectations for drugstore because I try
so many good products from drugstore
lately including Primark I'm not really
came for your products and makeup
revolution include it so it's like I
have high expectations now you know
cover and conceal cover war so I don't
got this makeup Academy I should have
put it this is that once called Allies
them desire so I'm gonna use
this shade is orange you show you here
on this fluffy brush system I understand
severe here's fluffy brush I couldn't
see it if they had any I should have
rushed you that I do they do they didn't
in mine anyway
okay the shutter is okay my brush is
picking up quite a good amount of the
color are y'all gonna have to build up
if you want it more intense because it's
not um it's not the most pigmented okay
there isn't a good amount of mattes in
here that like that one I just used
actually has a slight shimmer to it and
these are pretty much the only matte
shades on this one so I'm gonna go for
this one and just darken up the outer
corner and then just hit okay shimmer on
the lid just so we can see what the
shadows alike
this is starting my eye it's hard for me
to get a really good blend though
because they don't have a middle shade
it kind of just goes like orange white
gray or this color maybe I should try
this gray color no but some of this
color okay my eyes thing in really bad
okay the eyeshadows are the most
pigmented I mean you could build them up
it is thing in my eyes a little bit I
don't know what it has in it the causes
that I do find that sometimes of
palettes is I tried the collection
palettes once and they made my eyes race
things I don't know what it is something
in their formula I'm gonna try this
shade on the lid it's just really
crumbly okay that is a really nice
boiled shade okay the food chains are
way better than the mats I feel like I'm
gonna keep dipping back into this orange
but it's not going like any more orange
on my eye like this orange here it just
looks really like it always is I could
just took a subtle brown so they don't
have lashes so I'm just gonna put a
little bit of mascara on and I picked up
this volume high impact magnifying
mascara okay what the far I can't get in
this I don't think this makeup Academy
brand do eyelashes I couldn't find
anything anyway and we're gonna start on
my face I'm going to use this pro base
move set and prime it says it flawlessly
evens out complexion gently apply this
smooth balm over the skin to cover
finalize a mask create and a perfect
base in which to apply your makeup which
looks like this so let's give this a go
that is so weird case planar it's like a
pearls like Vaseline okay let's try this
keep it smooth out my pores I feel like
it's quite greasy its moves though I
like it definitely
smooth I would say that focus smooth my
paws at stuff it feels like greasy I've
just cooked my eyebrows I don't like
that I revellings and what I was excel
okay I then picked up this skin defined
map perfect foundation the darkest shade
they do is deep form yeah hey so it
comes with a pump so I'm just gonna put
some on the back of my hand
what is that oh my god is this a joke
this is like pure ash this is like gray
as fuck why is it gray why is this gray
seriously why and why is this the
darkest shade deep form Wow so I'm gonna
take my beauty but I don't want to put
my beauty Brenda in this foundation I
really don't I really don't this is
literally Asha turn your ashes at your
fucking funeral bitch like what is this
this needs to be cool fucking ash deep
ash not eat for not even deep what part
of this is deep can you tell me because
I already don't know what part of this
foundation is deep
listen after ash is up my funeral ain't
even going to be this Ashley this is so
ashy this needs to be called ash pure
ash pure ash I can't go over there
honestly like who who thought this was
okay who really thought this is okay
like always so this is the place to be
Matt right
this ain't Matt so I'm gonna use this
cover why even carry it on what is a boy
well it's a point
Disick so bad but we're gonna we're
gonna push through and yeah so I've got
this makeup a kind of a cover and
conceal to use on my eyelids which I
already don't like since they cover
anything but
and it's white like it's actually just
pure white and yeah again the shades in
this why do they have one white one on
one pink I don't know what's going on
there's no excuse for that it's like
even if this is like a cheaper makeup
like I've used prymaat makeup I've used
makeup revolution I've used cheaper
makeup and you get some amazing stuff so
what is this laziness this is what this
is this is laziness just made my under
eye look Wyatt I'm mad
I'm so mad even the power line makeup
wasn't this bad I look like flashback
this is why I look like okay so I picked
up this skin to pine matte perfect loose
powder and it just looks a bit like
yellowy this is one shade they have okay
so I'm going to take a separate sponge
with this powder on it
do you know why I shouldn't think that
powders too bad it's so hard to tell
there when the underneath looks so bad
that powder actually feels quite nice
the powder feels quite nice I'd like to
try this powder on top of like wearing a
good foundation in a good concealer I
call I call why so I picked up this
Sunkist bronzer which looks quite a tea
and more like the contour shade really
rather than up runs over the whole brand
should just be called ash ash makeup I'm
going to take my fluffy brush from NYX
this is what the bronzer looks like it
looks more contour shade I'd say that I
bronze are actually when you put on the
skin like now put it on I feel like it
looks really red so I picked up this mu
a glow be my lighting powder in the
shade gold
looks like it's already been opened I
think nobody puts up a used one okay so
you twist it right at this and it comes
out it's like a loose highlight so I'm
gonna use a brush for this I'm going to
use my Sigma soft blend concealer brush
I use this for high that one time okay
okay you know what else you like this
the highlight is nice okay I actually
like that
I think that looks really nice this
highlight the highlight is a yes from me
def I really love actually so picked up
this brush which is the pixel perfect
Multi blush okay there's like literally
no pigment at all yeah that's a no
there's literally no pigment at so I'm
like swelling my brush so hard and he's
not picking up like anything okay so I
lastly I picked up this long way matte
finish lip lacquer I wish I want to try
get a lip liner because I couldn't find
one so cuz it's matte it's not really
fine anyway smells nice okay this color
looks completely different to what's in
the bottle like that it was quite dark
it's actually quite like a coral color
so quite like anyway but okay the lip
color is not what it looks like in the
actual container but I still like I
can't I think it's quite nice and it
does apply quite thin like it's quite
sure but and you can build it up and if
this might comfortable it's not dried
down to Matt yeah I mean the only thing
the old definitely carry on using is
this highlight powder I think the
highlight powder is really nice
especially if it's on top of my
illuminator drops micronic London I
think you look so nice but apart from
that I think the eyebrow pencil is if
you like a harsh eyebrow and then you
like that I repent so that just isn't my
kind of thing I feel like it looks way
too harsh it stood a little bit too warm
tiniest amount and I shot a pilot is
okay I think you can get better ones for
the same price to be honest I prefer the
makeup revolution ones so that the
fucking foundation is pure ass that's
what I think to the foundation no knife
up no hell no I'm wise at the darkest
shade and I understand
the bronzer is okay when you put on the
skin yeah she's quite right and I think
it's the worst the concealer it's just
like doesn't really cover fuck all and
ya know they have they have a white
shade and they have a pink shade so
that's what I think to that as well but
yeah the only thing I'll say that I will
carry on use in is this highlight you
lose highlight actually you like it
