channel as hello hi is the new here my
name is Holly Boone so in today's video
I'm gonna be testing out the laura
mercier concealer and they did kindly
send me this concealer and I'm so so
grateful I really wanted to give it a go
cuz it's supposed to be a medium to full
coverage lightweight feel and all that
kind of stuff a long way and whatever
yeah I'm gonna give it a go and put it
to the test and see what I think so I'm
just gonna read you the product
description first of all it says this is
seamless coverage weightless feel
flawless wear coverage that won't crease
medium to full coverage flexes with skin
to seamlessly conceal under eye darkness
and facial imperfections all-day
hydration creates a crease resistant
natural finish weightless fear with
blurring effect incredibly light worth
formula feels undetectable on the skin
while the blurring powder blend diffuses
light to smooth the look of fine lines
and create a soft focus effect 12 hours
of high performance wear powered by skin
vision technology long wearing flexible
polymers fused to skin for 12 hours of
where that's transfer sweat humidity and
water resistant oil free available in 12
shades yeah it sounds good doesn't it I
mean it sounds amazing so I'm really
excited to try it and so they did send
me all the shades in here there are
twelve shades from fair to D I will say
the darkest color is not the darkest but
they could have more shades also they
don't I don't think they have a really
really light shade either I really like
the packaging it feels really nice so
you get 7 milliliters of product and
this retails for 20 pound 40 pence on
John Lewis I did find on some websites
this is 24 pounds but on John Lewis at
the moment is 20 pound 40 so 21:44 7 mil
product which actually isn't bad at all
I think this is going to be the best
shade for me and this is in the shade 2w
it might be a little bit too light I'm
just going to see if there's a dark one
I really like the applicator
this it's like a flat brush I really
like that okay yeah so that's three W
and that's two W I think I'm gonna go
with three so three W is a medium with
warm undertones and two W is alight with
warm undertones so I definitely love a
warm undertone to my concealer no primer
and foundation first see how I roll you
just concealer on for around eight hours
I don't particularly where my concealer
for 12 hours anyways so eight hours is
kind of the amount of time that I wear
my concealer not my makeup so I'm gonna
leave on for eight hours and we'll check
we'll come in and check and all that
kind of stuff so yeah I'm gonna first of
all prime my skin into my foundation so
I'm gonna use my wire cell or ours
primer I actually haven't used this in a
long this time I'm gonna give it a good
shake I'm gonna apply some of this yeah
I literally forgot I even had this I was
going from a makeup guru and I was like
oh it's my forehead I'm gonna use my
Maybelline 24 hours stay foundation in
the shade caramel beige I love this
foundation so much this is like a really
nice everyday foundation for me I let
you love it and that product one that is
similar to the Estee Lauder one I love
that but I feel that's more like a night
time where it took a really full
coverage whereas like I probably
wouldn't wear that every day but this
one is like my everyday foundation I
love it
Philip I've been reviewing so many
foundations lately that I keep
forgetting about ones I like a fun foot
a natural look on the eyes today because
I know in my last video my makeup was so
dramatic it was a little bit distracting
when I was trying to review face
products it's kind of like just just
traffic to you from unless you do it
this is like my everyday wear on my eyes
just a little bit of brown in the crease
and some lashes okay so now I'm going to
apply it the concealer I'm going to go
for the darker shades and vanilla 3w
which is a medium of warm undertones
just
guys I don't want to rebrand right today
I want something a little bit more
natural you could say so yeah I'm gonna
apply this under my eyes it supposed to
be a medium to full coverage which is
perfect and it's not supposed to crease
it's supposed to last 12 hours
I like this applicator I really like
this applicator brush on the end it's
flat I really like here it's really soft
I think 20 pounds for seven more product
actually isn't bad at all it's just like
the perfect shade for me definitely 3w
that is perfect for going down the
bridge of your nose because it's
something like the perfect wave of my
nose and it made it so straight yes to
that okay I'm gonna rent it in my Beauty
Blender I'm gonna press it in
okay it's definitely a medium to full
coverage just blending him really good
cuz I blend it in so easy oh my god that
looks so nice
Wow oh my god it feels nice and
hydrating exactly like it says it feels
even though it's a medium to full
coverage it feels really lightweight and
like really hydrate in it doesn't feel
dry or heavy it feels really nice I
think it looks so good oh my god oh my
god doesn't it look so nice wow I love
that I hope it doesn't crease and I hope
it wears well because if it does I think
this could potentially be a favorite
sometimes I find it really hard when you
put a casino down here to blend up that
a little bit there but it's blended in
perfectly and also this shade is perfect
3w oh wow I really like it so far
I'm very impressed so far okay what I am
going to do is I'm going to use the dark
color and I'm going to use this to kind
of like warm up my face I could always
do this is the shade 6w which is rich
with warm undertone this is the darkest
color that they do this in this
concealer and but I'm going to use it
just to
runs on my face this might be a little
bit too dark for me if I'm gonna put a
tiny little bit some would have been
this in West Bunge I'm just gonna press
this in Wow blend it in really well and
I don't feel like it's too dark so and
you put a tiny bit on so I feel like
it's not too much it it's good it
reminds me a little bit of the NARS
radiant creamy concealer fight it's a
little bit more full coverage than that
I also really like the flat applicator
it's really soft I think it applies to
put it really well especially when
you're applying for it under the eyes
you want to use something that's soft
because your under eye areas say
delicate so sometimes I find especially
with the NARS concealer is the
applicator is a little bit hard
I don't you guys know what you mean it's
a little bit rough and then whereas this
the applicator on this is really soft
and really delicate which I like I'm
going to set it with my Laura Mercier
translucent powder because I'm using
that concealer so I figured when I use
the powder as well it would work really
well together so I'm going to pick some
off my sponge and I'm gonna apply this
underneath my eye I really think my
under eye looks so good it was so
lightweight and it's a mediums full
coverage and normally the medium to full
coverage especially under the eyes sense
if it'll be heavy but it feels really
light way I'm just of course my next
thing for bronzer I'm going to use my
micro minerals skin finish in the shade
dark see I'm sorry I sound like a broken
record I use this in every single video
but it's my ride-or-die and I'm gonna
use my NYX brushes the o2 brush I'm just
gonna kind of press it on oh yeah so far
I am very very very very impressed I
need to try more Laura Mercier products
because I love the powder I also love I
had a highlight from there once the one
that looks like
I absolutely loved that used to wear
that all the time and I think tarty uses
their foundation and their foundations
and it was it's amazing on the scale I
always think I want to try it but I just
have so many foundations at the moment I
think it come from my dark circles
really well sometimes I have to put
color correctors on underneath concealer
because think sometimes still show
through okay so I'm gonna give this
concealer eight hours and we're gonna
see if creases if it moves if anything
different happens to it if it oxidizes
or anything like that we're gonna say so
I'm going to leave it for eight hours
but at the moment I am very very
impressed I think this could potentially
be my new favorite I just feel like it
looks flawless like I think it looks
amazing
I think the seven mil product the twenty
pound is actually really good and I
think that's not bad at all I do think
they need more shades but just it's so
creamy and it's a medium to full
coverage it blends so beautifully and
blend it out so easy
it feels so light way if those nice it's
no but luminous spidered obviously
powder and but it just feels so nice if
it was really really nice it doesn't
even feel like I'm really wearing like
much at all
I love everything about it so far I love
the applicator I think it's a perfect
way to specially kind on windows but it
just it's a really soft applicator and
it's also quite a flexible one it's
really soft under the eyes which is
really nice because obviously your under
eyes a very delicate area so I love the
fact that it's got a really soft brush
yeah I literally love it so far so yeah
I always see in eight hours I'm gonna
see what it looks like
well eight hours for me two minutes like
you two seconds for you but yeah hey
guys so I am back and it has been eight
hours before we go to the concealer I
just want to say I have no shine
whatsoever and no what do you want to
use this Maybelline 24 hours/day it does
stay on my face all day but I do get
really shiny and after like eight hours
I definitely get shot where is like it
doesn't look like that so I think it's
down to this primer the wire sell all
hours prime is the only thing I can
think that would make my foundation like
look like this after eight hours because
it's the only thing I
different in regards to like my chin and
my forehead like I have no shine what
the actual yeah like I used that
maybe in 24 hours a foundation several
several several times and I always wear
like a moisturizer underneath because
I've never found that like primers keep
my makeup all day I've tried so many
primers and I never felt like they
really kept my makeup on but I really
feel like this has stopped me getting
shiny like it's the only thing that I've
used different is that primer and I used
it because I saw it in my drawer and I
knew that I'd use two ages ago a few
times I am gobsmacked immigrants my
foundation no shine like what the hell
anyway onto the concealer so the Cocina
still looks perfect in my opinion it
looks so smooth under my eyes it looks
airbrushed I have natural like lines and
creases under my eyes anyway and the
concealer has gone in those lines but
that's not the concealer crease in this
I actually have creases under my heart
is like that's just how many eyes on it
still looks the same as when I applied
it eight hours ago it still looks so
nice and smooth and it just amazing and
honestly I couldn't I cannot believe
that my whole face looks like things
after eight hours I thought I could look
see exact same as like eight hours ago
when I applied the makeup right I don't
feel I find it any different and it's
really weird because like by now I know
we have like creasing around here I
normally have like a bit of shine I
don't have any of that I'm really
confused and yeah the concealer just
looks flawless as far as when I applied
it is so creamy it's a medium to full
coverage it goes on so nice it bends it
in really really easily
I love the applicator it's so nice and
soft fun to the eye and it picks up a
good amount of product as well which I
like yeah I do not have enough good
things to say about that concealer I
definitely think it's gonna replace my
makeup revolution one two the pure fact
that my makeup revolution one runs out
really fast because there isn't much
product in there I know it is only four
pounds and I was like oh my god you guys
full power over and we have a video but
it runs out so so fast it's like no
products in there and operation looked
at how much product comes in the actual
concealer
but yeah on me it just runs out really
fast
I feel like this laura mercier one is a
lot nicer to apply it's a little bit
more hydrating as well and also it's
wears a lot nice so like yeah this Laura
Mercier one is 20 pounds and 40 pants on
John nervous for some reason I look
fantastic it's 24 pounds I'm not sure
why it's different but on John Lewis on
the website it's 20 pounds for E so I
think 20 pounds forty four seven milk
product and the applicator is so nice
the packaging feels really nice and you
get a medium to full coverage it just
sits really really nice and it lasts
unbelievable
does my face ever look this Curt like I
feel like it looks exceptionally good
see everything that I use as my base
today I'm just gonna keep using because
I am shocked how good my base looks
after eight hours so yeah I think in
regards to the foundation it has
something to do with this primer because
it's the only thing I've used different
and it does say flawless matte long wear
primer I didn't even know as a matte
long with my mom I didn't even know it
is mattifying but it says flawless matte
long wear primer that's pretty white
it's kept me matte then and I'm not
shiny it is definitely this primer that
it's kept my face Matt I'm not shiny so
I am 100 percent a hundred millions and
using this every single time I wear that
foundation now you know I'm the first to
tell you when something I don't like
something I'm the first to tell you okay
but I love this I am you can see on
camera I think my basics amazing but
yeah anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this
video make sure to give it a thumbs up

will see you in my next video bye
