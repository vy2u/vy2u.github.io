channel and hello - new here my name is
holy Boone I always cringe my litte
wintry thing because I never know like
what to say so just keep it the same
anyway hi so today I'm gonna be testing
out the new l'oreal infallible long wear
shape and stick foundation I picked up a
bronzer shade a cream bronzer shade
foundation a blush and I've got some
primers and stuff so I'm gonna try it
out see what I think
and first things first I will say is the
shade range is really bad and
for a brand that has so much money so
much money this is just stupid it's
getting stupid at this point I'm just
yeah that's the first thing the first
thing is this no shade
there's one two three four five six
seven eight nine shades of Taylor Swift
and then three two let's say tarnish
dark shades and then a Rory dark shade
that's it so yeah that's the best thing
I am hoping they do come out with more
shades but if I so want to see if the
foundation is even worth it because I
mean if it's we don't need more
shades do you know I mean I picked up
this l'oreal infallible mattifying
primer so I'm gonna use this for like my
t-zone and stuff and then I picked up
this one which is a pore refining primer
and I'm going to use this obviously to
minimize my pores and we're gonna see
what we think of this so I'm gonna apply
the pore refining primer first I'm just
gonna put some on the back of my hand if
it wants to come out okay it's pink it's
actually pink that's word and you might
let's apply this in the center of the
face normally when you get like a pore
refining prime it-it's quite silicone II
because it's missed it fills in your
pores it kind of smoothes it out where's
this just feels like a cream like a
moisturizer okay I don't think it
smooths it out to be fair definitely
first me though
pause definitely look smaller okay next
thing I'm going to use my mattifying
primer and I'm gonna apply this I'm
going to apply this where I
early so my t-zone basically okay so far
I like the primers I definitely think
that's moved on my pores and it's
definitely made this feel a bit more
matte rather than shiny and it will so
stick the shine away as you can see I'm
gonna spray some on my mac fix+ just for
a little bit of hydration to the just
the rest of my face where Janet used
primer okay so for my foundation shade I
picked up the shade at golden beige this
is the shade golden beige so what I
would normally and when using creams and
sticks her foundation is set my primer
but because it's got a mattifying primer
and stuff always just try it it's just a
primer I think that's quite a good match
I'm gonna render in my sponge it's
blending in very easily it's very creamy
which is nice it doesn't stick to the
skin like some stick foundations tend to
stick or dry down really fast and not
like impossible to bend down I would say
it's a medium coverage or anything
that's a full coverage but then let's
just see if we can build it out so I'm
gonna just apply a little bit more where
I want a bit more coverage so mostly on
my cheeks on my nose
I whispered like foundation just doesn't
stick to my nose does anybody else but I
have to put like so much of my nose for
it to stay there I don't think you can
build it up anyway I'm going to move on
to concealer and then we're going to use
this stick for cream bronzer I'm going
to use the cream brush to see what we
think something is my makeup revolution
Cocina define in the shade c5c I'm just
gonna try it under the eyes
I hope she loved this conceive so I'm
gonna blend this in with my beauty
sponge coming up with the holes in the
sponge it looks she looks like a mouse
has been at it I know I need a new one
but I had a bit of black on there and I
could not get the stain up for the life
of me so I just yeah I need a new smash
don't lie to me
yeah anyway I'm gonna use the other side
without the holes the button is there
hey that's blended in well with the
foundation
I can tell with this foundation it's
already kind of creasing a little bit
here which happens to me anyway but not
normally like that quick I'm gonna say
that anyway so it's fine I just really
don't understand how companies that have
so much money like so much money don't
bring out more shades like what what are
you doing I don't understand
so the shades weren't cool enough to get
like a cream contour but I like to cream
bronze as you guys know I feel like if I
just use the powder bronze that he
doesn't bronze me up enough so I like to
use a cream underneath and so I'm I
picked up the infallible foundation
stick in the shade cappuccino which
looks like this it's yeah quite a warm
shade but I'm gonna use it to bronze up
the outer part of my face
oh so if I've got hairs all over my ears
I'm sorry okay I dyed my hair myself I
like it I like my ears everywhere every
time so just ignore that so I'm gonna
render sinan West Bunge right this might
be a little bit too more looks a bit
mustardy do you know what I mean
I've got put mustard on my face we
should make it work we can make it work
if then sit really well though very very
very creamy and Bend together really
nicely okay why don't I just take
so I mean it'd make my life easy
wouldn't it but okay so yeah Bend is
another really easy now it's been denied
anything get access bath to shade so I
picked up the cream blushes Raths in
this chain breezy nude which is number
two and I'm just gonna put some on the
end of the sponge like this apply it
like this because I don't want to
exchange this again it's gonna be too
much I do you like to bring my blush
quite at far back normally I don't like
to just keep it on the apples of the
cheek I think cream blush when you
haven't got much makeup on so like if
you're just going for a naturally
natural look and you're not even gonna
wear foundation I think cream brush is
quite nice I do think that cream blush
actually looks really nice I do what I
did just put a little on the back of the
sponge and just lightly apply it but I
look really nice it blends in really
nicely it's really creamy like the other
sticks and I think she looks quite
honest I'm quite impressed with that so
what I'm gonna do now is set all these
creams because at the moment I'm very
creamy and my makeup definitely not long
so I'm gonna set my under eye I'm gonna
use my Laura Mercier translucent powder
I actually found this in my makeup
drawer and it's only got a tiny bit left
so I thought I might as well just use it
up while I have it you know I mean and
because I do use my Beauty bakery run
all the time by just thought I might as
well switch it up use this one up so I'm
just gonna try this under the eye it's
fine you bit I'm trying not to put this
try these and powder over the blush that
I just applied because it's gonna take
the colour away I'm gonna apply this in
the center of my forehead I'm gonna just
set my smile lines because yeah the
cream was kind of already settling in
there so I'm gonna just do this
SMI smile eyes
okay so I'm gonna pry some powder bronze
over the top of that cream that's gonna
have to set that in place and it's also
gonna just change the color a bit so do
feel like it is still a little bit
yellowy just not quite the right time so
I'm gonna take my Mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade dark deep CA
it's a foundation stick anyway it's not
gonna help see a stick for bronzer so I
didn't expect it to be that I shared
anyway but yeah thought I'd give it a go
see I'm just gonna apply this on top
this is my NYX fluffy brushes in the
number 21 and I love this brush so good
oh my god it's three windy outside okay
I felt like the cream blush is fine on
its own today for I need to go over it
with any other blush I think that looks
really nice on its own so I'm just gonna
leave the blush how it is I'm just gonna
put some mascara on my bottom lashes I'm
gonna use my blood gel mascara from
benefit
okay honestly this mascara is no joke
like I really thought it was gonna be
over high like I really thought it was
just like bad girl bang was just gonna
be like their jaw I mean but it's
actually sick my bottom lashes
it was makes my lashes look so long and
nice no friend asking me about top
lashes for this because my top lashes
are so so no mascara is gonna help
that situation so yeah bottom lashes it
makes your bottom lashes ik so good so
I'm we're doing my highlight I might as
well do it on camera why you're here why
not is the amrezy highlight with Anasazi
Beverly Hills which is like to die for
I'm gonna spray my brush with my Mac
fixed-price in the scent coconut
I wasn't these from Mac which I'm very
grateful for thank you so much I love
this one of them but if you're on a
budget definitely just get the Mario
Badescu spray because they have
different scents in this one and I love
this one just as much so if you're on a
budget just get the Mario Badescu one
you don't need to get the fixed fast but
I've got it sent me so obviously I'm
going to use it you know you know I'm
gonna use this highlight it's just so
creamy it just like melts into the skin
and I can't even explain so I just think
it looks gorgeous look so delirious I'm
gonna put a little bit down the bridge
of my nose I die just focus it a little
bit more here as well being the brow
because it kind of makes this bit look a
little bit more forward which alright so
for my lips I'm going to use this boxin
plump line lip liner
I've definite not gonna use this to prop
my lips because we don't need them any
bigger bitch no well I'm gonna use it
because I like the color side this isn't
the color stealth no lying I'll it for
this it's just nice I'm gonna kind of
fill my lips in with this as well I feel
like it makes my liquid lipstick last
longer if I feel my lip similar then for
liquid lipstick I'm going to use this
barium mapme up matte liquid lip paint
which I really love this is in the shade
doll I'm gonna hit some top yeah these
liquid lipsticks are really nice and
they last a long time I had one on
yesterday and I
you there and drank with it and they
still looked well after hours okay so
I'm gonna check back in five hours time
and we're gonna see how the foundation
war how the cream blush is worn how
everything else is worn so we're gonna
see well it's like a five hours time but
my overall thoughts at the moment is
that I think it's really creamy really
easy to blend buildable to full coverage
I mean I didn't build it up all over the
face I only ever build up in certain
areas where for like a need a bit more
coverage and that worked out so you find
it definitely did work
I really doubt the cream blush
definitely like the cream blush but you
can't see it as much now put the
highlighter stuff on which is been doing
but I do really like that that's in the
shade raising nude and yeah they blend
together really really well they just
look nice so yeah I'm gonna check back
in five hours so I'm gonna see what we
think your anything I am NOT impressed
with is the shade range I think this
showing French is very poor for a brand
that has so much money
hey guys so I am back and it's been five
hours and I have to say I'm very very
impressed normally I get quite oily by
now especially my t-zone
I forgot that mattifying primer maybe
helps that fit going to be using that
more often I definitely think that did
something because normally by now I'm a
lot more shiny I mean I have still got a
bit of shine on my chin and a little bit
of shine it sort of inside of my
forehead but nowhere near as much as I
normally get by now yeah I definitely
think there's mattifying primer probably
has something to do with that and also
set in the skin but I think you know I
normally do something skin and I still
get oily so I think the mattifying
primer might be what's stopping me from
getting as oily so in regards to the
foundation it's very creamy it's very
easy to blend into the skin it blends in
very easy it doesn't dry down fast so
you do have time to work with the
product
it definitely blends really nicely with
the other ones if you want to get one
for cream bronzer and also the brush
works really well with it as well they
all blend in really nicely together the
only thing I'm very disappointed is the
shade rain lorry I'll have so much money
and this is not acceptable you have so
much money there's no excuse for it so
they need to bring more shades one
hundred million percent but apart
that if it the price is nice and I
probably will continue to do this I
probably will use this again
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video
