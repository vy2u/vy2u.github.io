channel hello hello hi welcome if you're
new here my name is Holly Boone please
subscribe so in today's video I'm gonna
be tested out the makeup revolution Pro
HD palettes and I also am going to be
testing up their flawless foils
I do believe these launched at the end
of February they kindly sent these to me
so I'm so grateful thank you so much and
see I'm gonna give these a goes but I'm
gonna see what we think about these but
these do launch at the end of February
I've got a few of these Pro HD palettes
I've got four in front of me here
this one looks right on my straight
there's a pop of color in here which I
love and this one is called defiant this
one is called innovation and then this
one is a socialite which is a tiny bit
like this one innovation but this one
has a few photo shades in it so I think
I'm gonna try out this palette which is
the innovation palette and then we're
going to try out these foils for the lid
and we'll see what we think she's got
some pinky shades some purpley shades
Black's Browns and whites and neutral
colors so yeah I'm gonna get this
palette of go these pastes are 15 pounds
and you get 35 shades in here which is
pretty good so I have done my face my
base makeup off camera just to save some
time so I'm gonna take some of my Beauty
bakery try to do some powder I'm just
gonna put some powder under my eyes just
to prevent any fallout and so if I do
get fallout I can just dust it away see
I'm just gonna put some powder under my
so I'm gonna press it in too much
because I don't want to bake as such I
just want to rest the powder under my
eyes to catch the fallout okay so the
first color I'm gonna use is this orange
right here when I use this for my
transition color I can only do like the
orange use the orange and the Pink's and
then talking out with some purple maybe
some black maybe some black and you do
get a lot of pigment there's a lot of
product that's coming on my brush you
get a bit of fallout but as long as I'm
completely over in mind so yeah I'm
gonna use this for my transition color
so I'm just gonna apply this just above
my crease really lightly
damn okay this orange is actually very
bright like it was very pikmin's head
I'm actually quite shocked that orange
is can't really good
I believe I'm only just discover makeup
revolution or has he been so intrigued
about all of their products since the
concealer like I used a concealer than I
use the eye shadow at this small
eyeshadow palettes of him they were kind
enough to reach out to me and send me
some stuff which I'm so grateful for and
I just very like impressed very
impressed that orange looks really good
and we do the same on the other side I'm
using my Sigma e30 brush by the way I'm
really excited to try these foils
because I'm actually filming late at
night because I got this package today
which I didn't expect was busy like all
day and I was watching those fours on my
hand and I was just so oh my god I
usually feel myself like I'm so excited
don't mind this brush by the way it's
just stained like like I've used so
many different shades in it like dark
purples black green and I've washed it
so many times and it doesn't come off as
anything because it's been clean face
like all the shades have just stained
the brush yeah I really should use dark
shades for dark brushes do you know I
mean in vise Neverland I never ever
learned I do it the same all the time
and I've brushes up with an
enemy's me and have to buy new ones cuz
that just annoys me so I'm gonna go with
this pink color in my crease again it's
picking up a lot of pigment I'm gonna
cut some off because like I said I
always liked going up a little bit at a
time and then bear it up so yeah I'm
just gonna pry this straight in the
crease where I've dried this brush the
bristles are just a hotter why honey why
why why
this is like a really cute Barbie pink
color I love it again oh my god the
pigment is a joke
I love this pink don't you know what
kind of look I want to do I'm Regis
going with the flow here like I really
have no idea I'm going back to that
orange on my a 38 brush edge of the pink
in with the orange oh and this brush by
the way is from morphe is one of that
eye washes out of that I can't think
doesn't have a number on it which i
think is really out of it and I stay in
every video and I'm sorry but I'm still
not over how annoying is I swear make a
revolution never used to be this good am
I just like I don't know maybe I just
kept on it I don't know but I don't feel
like it used to be this good or maybe
I'm thinking original Brown because like
I feel like I would have known about
this sooner you know so how am i how am
i use finding this now seriously what is
wrong with me been wasting money that's
what I've been doing wasting money and
like I said it's a thousand 18 we ain't
wasting money no more we're wasting
money know what so I'm gonna go with
this shade here which is like a berry
color and I'm gonna put this in the out
core not you know go on it and in the
crease as well and I'm using my NYX 13
brush I'm just gonna Pat this on instead
of rub and I'm gonna bring it all the
way in the crease because sometimes when
I rap I end up bringing it up too high
or I can't be try the product as as much
so I'm just gonna press it where I want
it so yeah I'm bringing it right in the
crease and the inner corner and the
outer corner we're gonna go for a halo
why cuz I want to put a foiled in the
center I'm gonna go back to the pink and
blend the edge with this pink
oh yeah then I'm gonna go back to the
orange oh my god how about why fake tan
hands in my last video why didn't you
tell me you know honestly like I didn't
even notice until I started in the video
and I was like oh yeah
I don't normally I put fake tan on how
I'm gonna fake tan on now I've just put
bronzers on my neck because I'm over it
fakes how makes you feel sick these
shadows are hot pin like this do
you see this do you see this please the
pit licker these eyeshadows make a
revolution can we just stop for a second
we're gonna stop I'm just gonna stop for
a second and we're just gonna clap
revolution it's gonna go a big cap
because honestly I'm sure I can't do I
wanted to try everything from make a
revolution so I'm determined like they
can't all be this get surely it was I've
really really been wasting money like
really I really have I'm just gonna take
this shade right here and I'm gonna
blend out the edge because I feel like I
brought the orange up a little bit too
high and it's not as blended as I'd like
Anasazi Beverly Hills brush that I got
with a palette and I'm gonna just go
over the edge just to diffuse it a
little bit so it does look a little bit
too harsh for me I kind of breathe this
is 15 pounds palette it's even cheaper
than morphe what we were doing what we
were doing relies honestly why are we
sleeping on this brand I mean you
probably not I'm forming that you so
when I set this dark purple shade here
I'm using the same brush from NYX the 13
brush which I just used yeah when you
use this shade as well just cuz I want
to make it a little bit more bumpy you
could say I don't want to apply too much
of this in one go you know I mean so
yeah I'm just putting this the outer
corner in the crate again and the inner
corner just darken up a little bit more
I don't want to apply too much of the
shade
just a little little bit then I wind it
back into that bright pink again okay I
like that
just dump it up a little bit cuz I don't
apply too much in this shade because I
don't want to make the look too dark do
you know I mean might link my ting from
barking 7 a.m. in morning she's kinda
muonic she's tired that brendan is so
easy as well so I've hurry didn't have
to do much work to burn that which
always good we're gonna do a halo eye so
I'm gonna apply concealer first I'm
gonna use my makeup revolution
considered to find in the shade c5
what's new I've been using this
every single day since I discovered it
as I'm just yeah
obsessed I'm gonna use my Sigma cream
color brush to do this I can't so edges
cuz yeah I can't even breathe what I do
this
you
okay it snapped on that I'm going to do
the foiled shadows so this is the one
that i've swatched on one hand earlier
when I was like so excited and this is
in the shade rebound I'm going to show
you what it's like on the hand and then
we're going to put it on the eye and
then I'm going to swatch the morphe so
you can see different shades I have here
so this is what it looks like you just
open up please if you see you get this
little bottle of like some sort of
solution and this is the intensifying
primer so this goes underneath this
shadow to make it way more you know BAM
see and then this is the shade which is
rebound which is like a rose gold which
I'm obsessed with I think I'll go
perfect with this look you just unscrew
this Lydia here I'm gonna put some on
the back of my hand just a little bit I
don't think you need too much of this
because you want to get a little bottle
so I'm betting you I need a little drop
and then I'm gonna take my cream color
brush which I had there which I had the
concealer on and I'm gonna use this to
apply the primer we're going to apply
the primer serve on the eye so it's
quite work and then I'm going to dip
into this solution which is very creamy
it's a very creamy shadow I'm gonna pack
this on top like it would applied that
over my finger but I think the fresh
supplies it as well but I've got big
nose on oh my god yeah a place is so
much better when you use your finger
okay I'm just gonna use the brush to get
in the corners so just right up to the
cut crease wow that looks really nice
when I just blend the edges of the
shadow so I'm going to take a mixture of
the dark purple and berry color ones
brush just go over the edge so what
happens is this solution tends to make
the shadow way more pigmented right so
it makes the fluid shade really
pigmented but then when I put the dark
on the outer corner it instantly made
that so much darker so I've had to
stocking up the inner corner and the
outer corner because it kind of just
went darker here and then it looked a
bit weird so you have just opened up
with the inner part outer corner and I'm
gonna just blend that okay so it
definitely is easier if you put some
mist the solution on the brush dip it in
the foil and then put it in the lid
instead of putting the liquid to the lid
and then the foil on top it's very very
foil and a very pigment here so I'm
gonna have to darken up the sides on
this side cuz I did on that side see how
I'm just building up that dark purple in
the outer corner which is the one that I
used two tiny bit up I'm this guy like
free in with it I'm just not even
tapping off the excess and just find it
straight to the lid I actually think it
expelled are conduc no no it's Nina oh
my god SHINee yeah
now you could even just put like a
little drop of the solution in the foil
and then mix it up and put it on that
way I think that might be a little bit
easier I think the way I did it on this
side when I put the solution on and then
put the forward on just made it a little
bit more difficult in the side this side
I just went straight on straight away
okay so I think the best way to apply it
would be either with your finger which
is difficult for me because I always
have long now said getting my finger in
those just all right not gonna happen
and or if you're going to use a brush to
put a little bit of the solution in
there to mix it around the brush and
then apply it or dip your brush in the
city shed and then put it in the foil
and then apply it instead of putting the
liquid on the lid first and then the
foil I found that that just made it a
little bit more messy but yeah I think
they look so good I'd like talents so
pigmented and just bombs so I definitely
need lock that I'm going to show you a
few more shreds say this is in the shade
rival which is a purpley color pinky
purple which is nice
so I'm going to again put some in
solution on the back of my hand pick up
some of this on my finger yeah it
definitely applies nice with the finger
so if you can do it with the finger I
would do it to finger so yeah that's
that color purpley pink so this is the
shade retreat which is like a green
positive effects of gold in it which is
really nice I would say you do have to
be a bit careful with how you um how
much how hard you press in the pots
because they are super pigmented like
this but it was so very very creamy and
it's like don't press too much or you're
gonna just like mess up the product but
yes that's the shade retreat which is
like a green flecks of gold I really
love that that's very nice they are like
crazy pigmented but they're very very
very creamy so just be careful not to
press too hard or put your brush in too
hard or anything like that the next
shade we have is unicorn foil which is
like a holographic white which you can't
run I think it's really picking up on
camera but it's a wipers got a
holographic reflect to it so I'm gonna
swatch this one so that's the shade
unicorn foil which is like I said a
while a holographic supper shade I love
that it's got like a reflective purple
torii looks more powdery and I'll put it
on the skin but like in there in the
container it looks more white this one
is conflict which I can see myself use a
lot because like a pot of gold shade and
I love my gold this is the shade
conflict so bronzy gold Wow why should
you put on the skin it's very orangie
gold it's nice it's really nice I can
definitely see myself using that one a
lot I love that so I think these are
going in store and online in February I
do believe so keep an eye out for them I
know they're not going to be expensive
this is makeup revolution so they're
always going to be very affordable so
definitely snapshot marks I think
they're really good like I said just be
careful don't press too hard it's a very
creamy formula and just a little you
just only need like a tiny tiny bit and
they're very creamy but yeah you can see
they're so pigmented
on my eyes it looks just as good so yeah
I love it
okay so I'm gonna go for the orange
shade again I'm gonna go under the eye
color excellence hit that bright pink
shade on my multi brush I'm on the
underneath and then I'm gonna go through
the dark purple mix with the berry color
I'm just gonna mix the two together on
my next brush and I'm gonna bring this
show closer to that I'm flying
sure I kind of want to try the
holographic whitish purple in the inner
corner for my highlight so I'm gonna
give that girl a set so I'm going to add
some line maybelline lasting drama gel
liner and my zoeva winged liner brush
and yeah I'm just gonna put a little bit
of black along the lash line not too
much I'm also gonna put this in the top
waterline as well did it really help to
blend your fake lashes in so when apply
some mascara just put some glue on my
lashes I'm using my cocoa ashes or more
which is so annoying I know I use them
all the time I don't use a few hours
I did actually order some new eyelashes
last night I wanted to try out some
different styles because I'm just stuck
on these and I just think and I always
thought of everything but I won't you
know I mean I need to switch it up so I
do want to use some of this white
holographic one in the inner corner of
my eye because I want to like really pop
it in a corner so I'm gonna give it a go
I'm gonna just apply some of this on
line my Sigma a 58 brush
oh I like that I really like that it's
coming up more purple on the skin like
it did on it looks really quite white in
this thing but then it comes up quite
purple it's quite cool where should I
stick my lashes on I always go middle
first then and then outside these lashes
are looking dusty I've worn these too
many times looking like they're but
crumb warm why stop in your eyes no more
but now okay so that is the finished
look I'm very impressed with the
eyeshadow pea under feels I'm very
shocked again the price is crazy
affordable and so in this palette you
get 35 shades for 15 pounds which is
really good the one that I used is the
innovation palette they have loads of
these which i think is really bomb as
you can see on my eyes the shades are
very pigmented they bend it really easy
together
I didn't struggle to blend them at all
and yeah the pigment was really good so
the palette definitely worth the 15
pounds obsessed
so these no individual foiled shadows
that come with this little solution are
very very foiled like very creamy very
nice they look bomb like they're
like if you want to gotten on that hour
and you want your eyes to stand out this
is something that you need these are so
good like I said they are really creamy
so just be careful when you pick up
product don't think you're brushing or
whatever because the solution is the a
very creamy so these are set to launch
in February so keep an eye out for them
they are going to be very affordable but
yeah make sure you check them out super
affordable and yeah I'm very impressed
35 eyeshadows for 15 pounds and it looks
bomb hope you guys enjoyed this video
