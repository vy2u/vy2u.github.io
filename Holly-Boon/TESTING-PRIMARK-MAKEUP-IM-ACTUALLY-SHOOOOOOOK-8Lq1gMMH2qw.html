channel if you're new here hello welcome
welcome welcome
so today I'm gonna be doing a video all
on the Primark make up or is actually
quite shocked I didn't expect this to be
that much stuff I got a lot of stuff I
want a bit crazy because I just didn't
expect it so yeah I'm really excited
I've got my receipt here so I can tell
you how much things were I spent a lot
like you can wash stuff I got stuck with
my eyebrows because I twist on my
eyebrows so I picked up this sculpt and
fix duo brow gel and crayon I didn't
know that it was a do open so I just
picked up so I thought it was a brow gel
because I did get a skinny brow pencil
in dark brown so yeah I'm going to use
this for brow gel and then I'm going to
use my skinny brow pencil and dark brown
to do my brows the sculpting fix brow
duo router and crayon it was 2 pound
okay so this side you get the crayon and
which obviously I picked up the wrong
shakes I didn't realize I just thought
it was a gel and but it looks a bit like
the anastacio um dunno what it's called
it's an Anasazi Beverly Hills pencil
like this and I can't think what it's
called
anyway so this end you get the brow gel
so I like to jail my brows before I do
the pencils I just keeps the hairs in
place so I just refers to it before said
I picked up this which is the skinny
brow pencil in dark brown which was 2
pounds
I'm hoping this pens who isn't going to
be too warm oh no it's not too warm at
all so it's a lot like the brow wiz and
it's also a lot like the NYX brow pencil
which is the one that I use all the time
so it's a twisty up pencil like that and
then on this end you have the spoolie
end which I love so as the Browns you
have to dry down for a little bit I'm
gonna zoom Youth over in so we can get
really up-close and personal it's gonna
start under under my brow okay okay this
supply is really nice just from the
first swipe just not like one of those
ones we have to go gianna means get
color payoff so okay then I'm just going
to through the brow and just doing that
little strokes so it looks like hairs
and then I use this end okay comb it
through okay I love this province oh so
yeah it's a lot like the next one and uh
necessity of ours it's actually nice and
then the railways because it's not as
stiff it's actually a lot creamier it's
coming up really well
yeah a lot the color payoff is really
good I think I was gonna buy this one
from now it's a 2-pound basically went
from using the precisely my brow pencil
from benefit which is pretty much
exactly the same which was expensive and
then I was like getting to it so quick
so I was like I can't keep using that
it's so expensive so then I went to the
next one which is exactly the same as
well and now I found this one with the
tube and which is exactly the same so
I'm very happy right now so the only
thing I do manage to get was concealer
because they didn't have my shade they
only have this shade which is really
dark and very yellow so I'm gonna use my
own concealer just because I actually
want this is her not good if I'm going
to use my makeup revolution concealer in
the shade c5 which is also affordable is
only four pounds gonna use this to carve
out my brows I got this buff and blend
smoky eye brush for 1.50 but I use this
as a concealer brush and probably not
first Mikey I okay just packed again
Oh so alone it has this small pencil
brush on one end and then it's like flat
synthetic brush on the other side so I'm
gonna use a flexing synthetic brush to
carve out the brows
it managed to get a sponge I don't know
if I might do sponges but there was in a
sponge available anyway so I'm just
going to use my V blender and we're
gonna just press that concealer in a
sponge and concealer is the only thing
in this video does not prime up but the
rest is gonna be yeah this brush is nice
it's one pound fifty and is doing the
job perfect so if you need a concealer
brush or a brush to carve out your brows
this one is just really good he just set
my list before I do my eyeshadow so I
did pick up this banana powder this was
four pound see I'm gonna just put some
in the lid I got this I shot up a
concealer brush again this was only what
this one's only one pound and this one
has a concealer brush on one and then a
bigger brush from the other end
police should use this door for my
concealer but this one's a little bit
more smaller and precise oh my god okay
I don't want to break my veneer so I'm
gonna get some scissors got scissors
it's all good I'm just gonna bottom make
sure there's no lines
it's creased see I'm using this banana
powder which probably isn't the best
shade and Ravi is translucent but didn't
have it so so good just gonna try some
of this on top that concealer I'm not a
bright because I need to use around
upstairs I'm so unfit ok the powder
feels nice and smooth I don't feel like
it except you know what right there I
picked up this bronze shadow and shade
palette which I thought looked really
nice it's got bronzer shayzon it's got
this nice blue shade and yeah I'm gonna
do it I like using this I'm really
excited
they really didn't have many eye brushes
I wish you just got this one fluffy
brush and those concealer brushes so I'm
gonna try and make this work anyway
otherwise I'll just use my own brushes
let me use this shade first of all his
palette change my hair use this shade in
my crease No so the palette was full
pound in the brush was a pound so far so
good and when he just use the same
fluffy brush
and I'm gonna go with a darker shade so
I'm gonna use this shade right here
anyway I'm gonna rise in the crease just
brush the shades are nice I'm going to
try some of these shimmer shades and a
set but the matte shades are nice okay
so I'm gonna use this shade next using
the same brush this is literally how to
do eye makeup of one brush one eye
makeup brush question is got two of
these fluffy brushes because just
couldn't find any eye brushes okay
I don't think that looks bad at all the
dark shade is harder to blend I think
it's because it's not completely matte
this dark shade so I'm gonna actually
cut my crease I'm using my time
revolution concealer again and this
brush let me just cut half my crease
carved up my brow really well no it's
carving up my crease many ways so yes to
the brush so when I said a fluffy brush
and when it's a that dark side I use
which is this one here and then we're
gonna just blend the edge there so that
we don't have that backwards over that
line okay for four-pound I am very
impressed so far I'm very impressed so
far mr. Potter I'm gonna try out one of
these shimmery shades I kind of want to
go through this one right here which is
like kind of like a rosy gold and I'm
using that brush that I used to carve
out the crease with the concealer I'm
gonna just apply this on top of that
okay okay we'll say it's a little bit
hard to get it to come on come on the
brush but it looks so good
don't you get it on the eye it looks
more of a bronzey gold on the eye and
then in the valley it looks more like
Mary's Goldie we're doing well we're
doing well guys and to him well
someone's I felt with these videos that
the
I mean that wish is a disaster so I mean
we haven't moved on to face yet on this
one so we'll just let's just not speak
too soon but Oh Felix good so far
okay so I've got this mascara which is
just like a black it says a high-impact
mascara ultra volume and lift and this
was three pounds I don't really care too
much when it comes to miscarriage
because I always wear lashes so mascara
is just so you know in if you don't wear
eyelashes and you probably care more
about like what you're starting to do
for you as long as it doesn't run I mean
I don't want mascara to run obviously
but hopefully I don't really care too
much I picked up these girls with
attitude eyelashes I think these are the
style fantasy I'm guessing that's what
the style is they're really fluffy and
they look like the ardell demi whispies
eyelashes and these are three pounds so
they also come with blue let them dry
down a little bit like I always do
I don't feel like you have to line your
lash line when you wear lashes like this
because they've got that little gap so
they don't know bend in way better with
your natural lashes so I'm just pinching
it to make sure that it's right on my
lash line oh yeah these lashes are
really nice too these are the fantasy
lashes I've got two Pesek he's always
stacked them but anything I won't stack
them I'd quite like got on its own do
you talk with lush that I would wear if
I'm wearing no makeup and I want like my
eyelashes to look nice I just took a
pair of these I'm because they look
really natural but I mean not you sent
this home I like to write about
eyelashes but you know okay I think the
makeup looks really nice so far the eye
shadow pipe support palette is really
nice that dark shades hard to blend but
I think it's hard to blend because it's
not a fully matte shade
there's a tiny tiny tiny tiny little bit
of shimmer in it so it's harder to blend
in the other shades yeah I got three
different primers plus the hydration
spray so I've got the blurring primer
this dangled a primer the primer water
and then I picked up this which is a
hydrating prep spray so I'm gonna just
 apply them all why not why the
 not so let's go with the
we're in from the first which is five
pounds he says PS dr. Tom insta go
hashtag selfie ready blur primer so yeah
it's just five pounds translucent Jerald
primer to blur the appearance of pores
and fine lines I'm guessing this is
gonna be really silicone II which I'm
not a huge fan of but it does smooth out
it does blow the pores so yeah I'm gonna
apply this
yes very silicone II but set of kind of
primers are really good for flaring was
like really good so I'm gonna press in
the center of my face I'm not gonna
apply this all over this one because I
don't feel like winning - yeah it's very
silicone II but like I said silicone II
primers are really good for Blair
another marinating pores and stuff so as
long as it works and I really give a
 stay all day primer that's almost 3
pounds extends the wear makeup smooth
skin to create the perfect base of
makeup so I'm gonna buy this one or over
and then we'll see what this needs to be
quite sticky it was gonna keep my makeup
on yeah it's quite sticky part istic you
bro it smells like actually smells like
oh that can it via mooster Iser yeah it
was it a little bit tacky its primer
water for two pounds so I'm gonna spray
my face with this this looks a lot like
the Smashbox primer water so I was
really intrigued for like primal waters
I just wore yesterday I feel like this
is a con I feel like it's just one more
time I think they play out you know
honestly I really feel like we gettin
played and we don't even realize it okay
I don't like this mother I don't like
this one up that one no that's enough
for me and I've got this one which is a
hydrating prep spray this one's got
camellia oil I don't know diagnose me I
can read and amino acids moisturize and
protects skin
witch hazel dieters pause okay well
anyway it was 5-2 pounds
give us a go this is a hydrating prep
spray always spray it away from your
face first because your face a little
bit it comes out as always that's nice
mmm that was nice okay I like that one I
like this one for the smell but then if
it really I don't refill a compadre it
so much picked up these strobing
highlight cream I want to put this
underneath the foundation and see if it
makes any difference got the shade
champagne in the shade pal both of these
were to posi each I think I'm gonna go
for this shade champagne which is the
dark one I'm just gonna dock this around
my face so when I applied underneath the
Foundation's to see if it makes any
difference - okay it feels quite dry
which is really weird just meant to be a
strobe in cream but if it was quite dry
and it looks good though put way too
much on it's just a nightmare to blend
out so okay but you know what it feels
weird I can't feel as dry but it looks
glowy so I don't know I don't know so
yeah I picked up four foundations and
this these are all like I don't even
know that the right shade so I'm gonna
light some of them a dark and then I did
pick up these little drops which help to
line your foundation so I mean NYX have
these and I've never actually used them
to see if it works but I want to try it
cuz I couldn't I couldn't get my
foundation shade anyway so I've got the
long way of mineralized foundation which
to me when I put on the back of my hand
looks really really nice but the shades
were way too dark it was only like three
shades and they were really really dark
so I had to get a dark shade so I want
to kind of try and lighten it with that
and then I did get this medium coverage
semi matte finish foundation which is
called my perfect color and then I did
pick up this medium-full coverage matte
finish oil-free foundation so don't
really want a matte finish I prefer a
semi matte or a moisturizing foundation
today so I'm gonna try these two but
this one's quite like this one's quite
dark so I might first of all just try
and mix these two together
it's still too dark I want to use these
little drop thingies
anyway this foundation was five pound
down to two pound and this is the
long-wave mineralized foundation this is
in the shade chestnut which is way too
dark like I said okay yeah this one
which is the medium coverage semi matte
finish is two pounds fifty and I've got
this in Australia light beige yeah I'm
gonna mix these two together and see if
this works the little drops were four
pounds and apparently they have to
lighten your foundation they also have
darker ones in there if you need to make
your foundation darkest so I'm gonna mix
these two foundations together I think
if I mix them together they should be
okay my gosh it's going everywhere it's
still too dark it's gonna look crazy so
I'm gonna put some of these little drops
in these little white drops and see if
this helps
I'm just gonna put like a 20 bin I feel
like I'm at school you know you know
it's cool and you get a little thing of
painted you just start mixing
colors this what I felt I'm doing right
now for primary school I used to go
around people's things and just mix it
with a color stick around just go on
with me a little prick anyway that's
better
so okay that's way though oh that
actually like that she works in these
other drops okay if you need to lighten
your foundation those drops or where
it's at
they really do work and like I said they
have dark they have them darker drops as
well so if you need to darken your
foundation you can as well which i think
is actually really good we have some NYX
do that and they have that I've never
I've never tried here like I said I
couldn't get a sponge so I'm gonna use
my Beauty Blender look up under sin it
smells like baby soap okay it's actually
coming up quite nice okay I actually
think it looks good I did mix two
formulas together like this foundation
is really a long way mineralized
foundation and this one's a medium
coverage so I did mix as you together
but I actually like it I'm really
actually impressed this one's got SPF
Dean in there and this one a joke has
any SPF in it don't think so you want to
do the same thing as we mix them this
one was on sale for two pounds and this
one's to 550 so you'll still get N two
foundations for 4550 so you can't be
reminded that and today what it looks
really good on my skin I still feel like
you can see that strobe cream underneath
as well because you got a little bit of
glow so that's definitely worked which I
like yes to that so concealer I'm going
to use my revolution concealer because I
couldn't get one in my shade then you
have the dark shades left but again this
concealer is only four pounds and it's
full coverage it's ugly like the shock
shaped hey and you know what I was gonna
do the bit whole video like comparing
this to touch okay but I don't wanna
spend this on even thought same day I
don't want it it's like 30 pound once
you get delivery and stuff of QVC it's
so expensive so I just know you know I'm
honestly like I really really really
like this foundation you know this
foundation concoction looks really good
for four pound 50 what the okay so
consumers blended in nicely with the
foundation so the casino works really
well the foundation and the concealer
isn't Primark but it's really affordable
say I'm gonna use this banana powder
which I used on my lids could see only
part I managed to get this one is four
pounds I'm guessing this is meant to be
a bit like the Ben Nye powder I don't
personally really like the been lying
powder but um we're gonna try this
anyway so when you use my sponge for
this it has made my under-eye look a bit
more yellowy I don't even think it looks
bad on my new using the tiniest bit
because it is a banana powder so if see
it's got a very it's very yellowy so I
don't want to look too yellow so for
darker skin tones this would be really
good it looks nice and smooth again like
I said it does am
has my turned a little bit yellow but
anything an expired cuz I only use it is
it I am very impressed with that I don't
what the flashbacks is gonna be like
with that you test that I did pick up
this my paper color concealer stick
because they did have the darker shade
so I wouldn't use this as like a cream
bronzer so I did get the shade caramel
have like a fear of stick concealer
after that how no makeup on just like it
get this little oval brush which I
actually forgot about I couldn't use my
foundation but I forgot how to put this
up this was space before power down to
two pound and it's like one of those
oval brushes so I'm gonna try this to
blend out this this is not EPA this
concealer stick I'm gonna use the
bronzer mmm
I feel like it's probably not dark
enough I did get a dark on as well I
think it's too dark and isn't she HS not
oh okay maybe not
chestnut can work I'm gonna use this to
contour my jawline i use this oval brush
which was to power and should have been
for power
it was Virginia's so I'm gonna try and
use this to blend in the cream concealer
it's pretty soft Leslie see how this
works okay okay this really just blend
this in really easy sometimes I don't
like using these brushes because they
can't disturb the foundation underneath
but it has a which is good I'm actually
shocked I hope that this foundation
looks not ready to blend in really easy
with this brush like very easy so I did
get this which is the gold rush
highlight palette which actually has a
bronze a blush and to highlight shades
in it which i think looks really nice
looks like this I'm excited to use that
for whole other thing I think it's
really nice so when you use this for
bronzer which might be a little bit
orange but I'm gonna just a pilot for
small small well I'm going to use this
powder foundation brush which is one
pump which was one power 50
good news this for my bronzer I'm just
gonna go over where I applied the cream
this okay it looks way more orange in
the pan like when it when you apply it
to the skin it doesn't look that orange
at all and then I've got this blush
brush which was 2 pound 15 I'm gonna use
I did pick up this blotter as well
actually it was good longhand 50 which I
think it's really nice it's like a coral
pink color but I think for now I'm gonna
just use this in this palette this
palette was 5 pounds so I'm going to use
the blush in here okay I think I went a
little bit over the top with the blush
but it's fine so we're gonna highlight
which I'm really excited I'm gonna use
this one here which looks on round
can we just oh oh my God look how
pigmented that is what the oh my
god the one next to it is more like a
pinky gold like a rose gold I'm gonna
use like the gold gold one I did get
this fan brush which was one pound 50
this brush okay when you go to pick up
the product you get the blows of it like
blows oh it just falls out everywhere so
just be careful of that oh oh my god
this is a really good well it's bad
brush applies it really nice as well I
do love a fan brush for highlight - this
time I think it supplies it really
evenly I'm really good so the fan brush
is definitely a winner you need to get
this palette just purely for the blush
and the highlight I did pick up another
highlight as well this one's a radiant
glow highlight powder this one was 2
pound 50 I'm going to apply a little bit
of this on top to line up the highlight
a little bit because it is a little bit
golde golde but
it's be a bit brighter so just try some
of this on top and see what it looks
like ok prymaat really did that you know
I'm not really did that
ok love that as well that was to 550 if
you want more of it if you're like a
lighter skin tone this one the perfect
next tip I'm 50 this one's a radiant
glow highlight power doll and this one's
in the shade moonlight beam well I just
piled the two on top and I love that so
from this palette I'm gonna mix this one
and this one together and I'm gonna take
my light that just the tiniest bit I
don't want too much why she really
shocked the house come out I think it
can't really nice okay so I pick up
there's a line I pencil in this brown
color I just want to put this in my
bottom waterline she was one pound and
it's really creamy actually I picked up
so much lip stuff because I was honestly
like loving every single color was I'll
tell me lip products I have I'm just
watch the one on my hands so you guys
can see them I did pick up this glass
which to me looks exactly like the dose
of colors in the nke graphs which I
haven't followed me now I'm gonna swatch
some wife so you can see the difference
this one is three pound and just from
watching it I've just noticed this one
is the prime like one okay so that one
next to where is there desi and ku1
which looks a bit more pinky but it's
just because I used this over the top of
a pink lipstick I mean this this was
limited edition anyway so you can't get
anyone which is really annoying and I
lost his gloss so when I saw this one I
was like okay that's amazing this was a
three pound and it's just as nice so
yeah if you didn't manage to get there
does he in Katy gloss you can now go and
get it from up this one is the peach oil
lip gloss in the shade peach fall and it
was one pound this way sweetie by 15 it
is one pound and that's that one I love
it I think it's so nice I got this one
which is a go insta go max color lip
plumpers
and this one was three pounds but yeah
that's that one they're really pigmented
considering they're like Sochi this one
especially is really pigmented that one
not as much but this one is very
pigmented it's only three pounds and
it's supposed to be prompt in so if you
like plumping glasses then you love that
and then I got this one which is the
perfect shine lip gloss in the shade
stay in peachy and this one was supposed
to be 2015 it was a pound and I love
peachy glosses I like my favorite oh my
god I love this that's that one it's a
really peachy peachy gloss oh my god
this one is my favorite I love this
really know where that one now this one
which is PS my perfect nude nourishing
lip gloss in the shade paramount kiss
which is that one which again is so
pigmented and it just looks so good it
looks so nice and yeah that one was too
pound and then I did get this liquid
lipstick in the shade like that which is
from PS insta girl intense liquid
lipstick and yeah this one was two pound
which is that which is really nice then
I'm gonna go for the gloss I did get lip
pencils as well I got this one from PS
lip liner pencil in the shade biscuit
and this one was one barn and then I got
these two which are from the same brand
which is PS it's to go kiss proof lip
liner pencil this one's in the shade
selfie and this was in the shade like
that I'm going to use this which is from
PS lip liner pencil and shade biscuit
okay so it's one of those types of
pencils I always find these ones way
more creamy and it is really creamy I
kind of want to fill my lips with this a
little bit is this gloss which is the
perfect shine gloss and stay in peachy
the one that was to no one pound this
was one pound and it's at future class
I'm gonna love this
this smells like sweets mmm I love this
I probably want to put some of this one
on top and because it's got little bits
of gold in it so I'm gonna realized
this one suppose that sweet it's not so
good okay so I did manage to get in the
set in sprayer I don't know if they have
a setting spray or not I couldn't find
one so I'm gonna just use this hydrate
in prep spray I'm sure it'll just be
fine
I would just spray this and see if I can
get it back to my skin again this was
only two pound so that is the finished
look but I'm actually very very very
impressed I'm actually just like I can't
say anything bad about anything
everything is worth the price and war
I'm gonna just take a picture of my
makeup with flash and I'm gonna see if I
get any flash back because that would be
the that would be good final thing for
me there we just take a picture okay
one flash there's no flash back as you
can see no flash back okay okay I'm sure
