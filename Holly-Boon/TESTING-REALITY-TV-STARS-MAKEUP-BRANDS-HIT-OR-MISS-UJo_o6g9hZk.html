channel and hello hi it's a new hit my
name is Holly moon so in today's video
I'm going to be testing out some reality
TV stars makeup brands and you get
tweeted quite a lot asking if I can try
at Katie's brand and Charlotte Crosby
I'm not kind of soft so I said why not
try it all in one video though I've got
like a whole bunch of stuff here they
all kind of have the same sort of thing
like eyeshadow pies in Eclipse ticks and
lipgloss something that I don't tend to
have like face products so I have just
on my face off camera I did my eyebrows
my foundation my concealer and I did my
lids as well yeah I'm just gonna go
through all of the stuff that I got I'm
gonna start by saying this stuff was
expensive like I was actually quite
shocked yeah it's quite expensive so
anyway I got this fleek professional
master brush kit this is Charlotte
Crosby's brush kit this brush set was 50
pounds so it's 50 pounds and you get you
get 13 brushes in here for 50 pounds
wow that's expensive yeah one thing I
did notice with these sort of where your
TV style makeup runs is that you charge
a lot I don't know if it's private
labeled stuff or if they've actually
made the product themselves but it's a
lot okay so this case it comes in it was
really nice actually
wow that was really nice and it's got
this magnetic it's got this magnetic
closure thing wow that's really nice I
hardly expect that okay so these are the
brushes the brushes are really nice so
like this rose gold metallic kind of
look they've got fleek right on them so
but it's no netting over the top of
space to protect the brush which is nice
so you get seven face brushes in here
and then you get six eye brushes
although I wouldn't really say this one
and here's an eye brush it's put in a
tube a and but I'm gonna test the
brushes out anyway and we'll see what we
think so the next thing I got from sleek
I hope this a you say is a fleek or
three K or it might be three K I don't
know anyway this is a shot across me
again this is a highlighter globe
palette this is huge this is actually
very big like I don't know why I didn't
expect it to be this big so anyway
it comes in this like sleeve so this was
how much was this this was $29.99 again
that's expensive so here are the shame
so you've pretty much got straight in
here for everyone to be honest I mean
it's just gonna be - Wow
shit these are very pigmented oh my god
I just put one on my hand there look how
nice that looks
it's very creamy I'm actually very
shocked that I know Weis didn't expect
much from Riley TV star brows that just
cuz they don't specialize and makeup so
just didn't expect you know but that
wall and on the back here it says with
love Charlotte Crosby which is cute I
like the rose gold as well with the
white it's nice next thing I got from by
KD is just mesmerized eyeshadow palette
and this is Katie from LA fighters brand
so I mean Katie I think how you did
makeup before
- I love Island so I think she's quiet
Crudup when it comes to makeup so I'm
pretty sure she's like - she was like a
freelance makeup artist or something so
you get ten eyes shadows in this palette
and this was 45 powers shit like that's
expensive painting you guys expensive
way by powers all of that you get a
mirror which is nice you get a mirror on
this side I like the colors in here and
hey you also get a brush that comes over
as well so it's kind of the anastasi one
where you have the flap the fluffy and
one end and then like the sort of short
shader brush on the other side okay so
that's one of those like Fuli shades
again it's nice it's really nice but
45-pound 410 I shall have oh my god I
mean when I went to order it online and
I was like oh my god don't be able to
pay 45 pounds of ten all right shadows
I did it for the YouTube did it for the
YouTube video but yeah I'm going to try
that out I like the packaging as well
it's like iridescent right and as well
it kind of shines different colors it's
really nice and then it has the
ingredients on the back the website the
Instagram so we're going to give that a
go and then I've got this bike hey Dee
a velvet liquid lipstick these are 18
pounds this is in the shade on button
okay cute packaging
I like the package it feels nice doesn't
feel cheap it's got by KD there she's
nice
okay wow that was with one swipe so flat
right now at my face it's a flux I've
just got the zero on concealer and
foundation I look weird but don't worry
we'll get to the video soon I just want
to show you what next day I've got here
is a by KD lip pencils in the shed una
Tran it's actually natural but I can't
help as I knew Naturals you know I mean
it's got like a Mac feel to it I thought
these this looks like a Mac lip pencil
these are twelve pounds I thought I
didn't have to like push hard to get any
color payoff which is good so that's
good like that yeah okay just cool but
girl these prices I can't dilled
okay I've got a vinyl lip lacquer here
in Lovers Lane these are 16 pounds and
it says it's a highly pigmented long
weary at lacquers providing more
coverage than a regular lip gloss mm
okay again the packaging feels nice it
doesn't feel I'm cheap or anything so
that's the gloss in the back of the hand
that's two swipes and I'm putting on the
back of my head it's a little bit sticky
I'm gonna see how it wears on the lips
but I'm not a huge fan of really sticky
glosses so I'm not sure I'm gonna feel
like that but it looks nice on the back
of my hand anyway so next got these
lashes from by KD these are in the style
dolly which look like this and these
were 23 pounds so yeah 23 pounds yeah
and then I've got this lash applicator
well which has by Katie Ritter and this
is cute and I don't have a lash
applicator so I'm gonna try this I don't
we just do it my fingers but this might
be actually easier so I'm gonna give
that go and yeah this was eight pound
dis your lash up okay yeah oh my god
it's a legit a blizzard outside but it's
snowing so heavy I just caught it out
the corner of my eye and it looks
crazy I settle in as well as been dying
all day so I woke up at like 8 o'clock
because I thought I'm gonna go to the
gym looked outside I was like okay I'm
not gonna go to the gym because I'm not
driving in the snow my car cannot cope
with snow the back end just spins out
like it's just not a suitable car when
it comes to the snow I don't know why I
got a convertible car
we live in this country but you know the
last person I order from was Chloe Lewis
beauty and this is one of her lipsticks
this is in the shade typically me and
this was probably not in iron so yeah
the one thing I would say about these
you know reality TV stars I have the
makeup lines this stuff is expensive man
like I know you're gonna make coinage
shit both black wanna Chloe Lewis his
lipsticks I love this packaging it's so
nice it's white and rose gold again
everyone seems to do the white and rose
gold it's I don't know I feel like it's
like a trend
everyone does Weimar is gold but it
doesn't nice and it's got Chloe Lewis
written there and he's kind of like a
matte feel which is nice this is tiny
oh my god I really didn't expect that
okay this is smaller than a normal
lipstick that is so small I don't know
if you can tell I'm coming but that is
tiny so let me compare the two again
this is my Mac one and this is Chloe
Lewis and I'll show you the size the
prints I look at the size difference is
they're not width and stuff like and
even that bit is so thin compared to
that can you see what I mean
like that is not a lot of product at all
and that is $12.99 $12.99 what so I'm
gonna try these sleep or fleek a
whatever the brown is called and brushes
so we're gonna take that fluffy brush
that all over the lid brush this you
might worsen
this is a big blending brush but that
could maybe work potentially and then
it's little brush here okay
I'm gonna use the mesmerizer palette
from Kady so with the Kady palette I'm
going to take this a big round fluffy
brush and so I'm going to go for this
shade here from the by Katie palette
okay so it is picking up a lot of
product which we like and there's not
fold up in the palette so I'm gonna just
lightly apply this just above my crease
so I'm just apply this just above my
crease it's gonna do circular motions
and kind of that backwards and forth
okay this brush is actually applying it
really really evenly realize the shadow
looks nice the moment okay that color
has applied nicely with this brush I
want to use that boy what are you gonna
use in my bottom lash line you use a
Browns on top I didn't look for over a
year ago now I did like a brown smokey
on this up in their blue and rush I
haven't done that since like literally
last year so I'm gonna just go for a
smoky eye on the top and then we'll do
the collar on the bottom so I'm going to
take this shade right here on this flat
brush and I'm gonna apply this all over
the lid I always think it shows the
quantity of the pipe when it comes down
to dark shades because I feel like in
place it's so hard to get dark shades it
pigment concert you know I mean and so
far this is working out it's quite a
nice fun one of these this eye shadow so
far it's like quite a creamy feel which
is nice I like a creamy shadow I'm gonna
go through this fluffy brush instead
because it's a bit thinner and we're
gonna go back to that light brown color
and then deep travel on the edge here
and see how we go so I like to kind of
go back and forth and then do little
circular motions I feel like the
circular motions helped so much and to
speed up the blending process like if
you just keep going back and forth like
there's it takes longer okay so I'm
going to go back to that dark shade
because where I've started blending it
it's kind of lightened that color and I
wanted to stay dark so I'm gonna go back
over it I wish there was a shade in
between this one
not one because trying to blend these
two who's different cooks is not like an
in-between shade in this palette I love
a smokey eye at the moment I've been
wearing it all the time they blend well
but I just wish there was like a shade
in between these two shades brushes are
working really well they're really nice
actually
and I'm not getting that spiky field the
bris was aren't falling out
I've had brushes before where I use it
in the bristles up or not so these are
nice brushes oh my god so I've been
watching Revenge body Khloe Kardashian's
show I watched a few of the old season
but like I didn't really watch it like
religiously or anything and then I've
started watching her sick is her second
season and it makes me cry like the
people and they're keep making me cry
they're just so cute I like to see and
I'm not achieve their goals and stuff
there was a guy on there I caught his
name he was like a blogger and just
pretend to be a rich person when in
reality he was like homeless and he
couldn't control his way and he lost his
mom and stuff and oh my god made me so
sad I for the new probably turned his
life right lost weight it's amazing
anything whole like thing for his blog
and I was like that is so cool it's such
a cool program I love it because I feel
like she doesn't just help with people's
weight like she really helps people
don't turn their life around like is in
like their career and stuff as well
which is so cool so I'm gonna go with
this shade again and I'm gonna run this
underneath the eye
so I with this fiber under eye concealer
I love accessory full coverage and at
the moment it's the only thing that
seems to be covering my dark circles and
I don't know why my dark circles I've
got bad recently but it's the only thing
that seems to be covering her but this
does crease lightly on me but I don't
mind because when if it's shadow
underneath the eye anyway you can't even
tell that is creased which is good but
like if I was to wear like no eye makeup
or just like a tiny bit of eye makeup I
probably won't use this concealer I'm
gonna put some in this blue along my
bottom waterline so this color right
here and
it's a little small brush from the
pallet if it's close to the lashline I'm
just going over the top of it with that
dark shades I use them over the lid just
a tiny bit of that just clear we went
dark blue a little bit if you don't blue
eyes and you've never done this before
like you you missing out if your blue
eyes if you put a blue on your bottom
waterline your eyes are gonna but I'm
like your eyes are gonna be beaming like
on a senior shiner yes this is a nice
creamy shadow not much fall out which is
good don't talk about any fallout
that's really weird and then we're dark
red again and just go along the edge
darken up a little bit so I'm gonna add
a line is my bottom waterline I'm going
to use my Marc Jacobs these are just
like he's a matte gel eye crayon it's in
the shade whirlpool I love these
eyebrows I can't explain they are so
creamy and just like the best the best
icons be bottom waterline they do so
many colors which I love as well I'll
link it in the description box but I
love them they're just so bomb turquoise
color rather than a blue okay I love it
it's so good okay so now I'm going to
apply some mascara I'm just gonna use
some my bad girl bad bad girl bang you
know I can't say it in a warned this
channel okay then we're gonna stick
these by Katie lashes on in the style
droll I'm gonna use my house of lashes
eyelash glue so it's my fave I'm gonna
use this by Katie lash applicator and
see if I find this more helpful I always
take the outer corner first and then the
inner corner and in the middle I
personally do not find that easier
because i find it quite big and I'm just
used to doing my fingers I think that's
why it's really good at getting
placement of where you want to put the
eyelash if you're new to put eyelashes
on I'm living for the last year's I love
these they're really fluffy okay so he's
a fusion of the rest of my face I'm
gonna try out some of those brushes
from Charlotte Crosby I'm going to use
this round fluffy brush like looks like
this and I use my Mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade dark deep I'm
going to bronze off a little bit
I'm just going to apply some blush I'm
going to use this color from my Primark
palette this is the shape blaze
I like this blush as I'm gonna take this
big fan brush to hide up my face because
there isn't really anything else I can
use so I'm gonna use a fan brush I'm
gonna spray it with some fixed glass
from Mac this is the lavender one and
then from this highlight palette then
what shade of one is okay I'm gonna go
with some best which is this one right
here okay I don't think the fan brush is
really doing this any justice it's too
big maybe hey there's a nice highlight
there's a nice highlight I win so this
is the best way to apply it I mean you
do get quite even application when you
use a fan brush but it's always said
that one of the hardest ways to apply
highlight I find okay so I'm going to
highlight the inner corner of my eye and
we need to shade rich sans which is the
one below the one I just a bit lighter
I'm gonna pop that in the inner corner
okay so I'm lastly gonna try out lip
products but I think I'm gonna bother
with this Chloe Lewis lipstick just
because that's definitely the wrong
shade for this type of work and I just
watch this on the back of my hand and
ice like is this supposed to be a gloss
like it it's glossy so I'm going to use
this by Katie lipliner desert or natural
liner I'm gonna use this along my lips
the pen slip line is really nice I like
to slip blowing on okay and then I also
got this liquid lipstick color from ykd
so I'm going to try this as well okay so
I really like that color liquid lipstick
I really like the lip liner looks really
nice
also this liquid lipstick feels nice
doesn't feel like really drying or
anything which is good so I also have
this lip gloss this is from Holly
Hagan's brand this is called pretty
little lips this is in the shade five I
do love this lip gloss I've tried it so
many times I've won it like so many
times it's really nice I'm gonna put
this gloss on top of him
see I love this cross I always get also
what look glossy you I'm gonna wear this
it's actually like nice color okay so my
overall thoughts and everything is that
everything that I used I think worked
perfectly fine worked really well and
the only thing I would say is that the
price of stuff is just so high and I
understand why it's so high and
especially this eyeshadow Pawnee has ten
shades it's a 45-pound that's so like
Anasazi Beverly Hills prices and like
that's like that kind of prior such
don't I don't I I don't understand why
this is so high but it doesn't really
nice it works really well it's a nice
palette it is a nice plate I'm not gonna
knocking the pilot the form of the
shadows is nice it's nice and creamy and
it blends nicely together
I just it's just the price of stuff like
the brush kit it was fifty pounds for
thirteen brushes which actually isn't
too bad when you think about fifty
pounds for thirteen brushes is not too
bad considering it comes in a really
nice wallet as well at the wallet is
really nice so you close up of a
magnetic thing it's nice the brush
design is nice as well like they look
quite bougie and they feel nice so the
brushes are so 50-pound I think is too
bad I'm not the worst not the best not
the worst I really like the lip line
I liked liquid lipstick I like the
highlight palette the highlight palette
was nice and dirty power and again very
power for 10 highlight shades is not too
bad again but when you're looking at
things like drugstore that you can get
highlights like this in the drugstore
yeah it kind of likes Janine lashes are
really nice the lash applicator is
really handy if you're somebody that's
nice eyelashes it's easy to place the
lash I personally put phase my fingers
and this I did find it a little bit like
especially trying to get in the inner
corner and stuff it's a little bit
annoying but if you are someone that's
new just to place them and then maybe
just with your fingers is actually quite
good I love this lip gloss Ivy's lip
gloss are hundreds of times anyway but I
love to skip classes from Holly Hagan's
brand but like overall I just think the
products work well they are good but
they're just it's just the price for me
that I think shouldn't be as high I
think a plenty all of these brands
should bring their prices down if
possible in the guys's Corey Lewis
lipstick I should be disappointed if
small weights like tae seok little
travel-size one and it's again the price
of it I just yeah the over the only
thing I have a problem of the stuff is
the price everything else I think is
fine this stuff works really well the
makeup came out really nice yeah that's
met anything we surprised so that is the
finished video I hope you guys enjoyed
it make sure to give it a thumbs up if
you did that helps me out loads and make
sure to subscribe I have a video coming
on Friday and a video coming on Sunday
