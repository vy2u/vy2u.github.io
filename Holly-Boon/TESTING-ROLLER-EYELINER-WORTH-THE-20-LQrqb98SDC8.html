channel and hello hi welcome of your new
hair my name is Holly Boone so in
today's video I'm going to be tested out
the nude Stix
rock and roller eyeliner so news Stix
sent me this yesterday I'm really
interested to know like does it actually
work is it actually easier like
obviously interested because I think
probably winged liner and eyeliner is
one of the most difficult things when it
comes to makeup so it's called the rock
and roller easy eyeliner Inc and it's 20
pounds it says that it's a revolutionary
ultra fine rollerball eyeliner that
glides Inc for easy straight smooth
lines along lashline high pigment sweat
proof smudge proof and waterproof
waterproof okay this liner stays put for
24 hours I like traditional felt such
brush tip liners the line won't always
be perfectly straight and even ink dries
down matte but never flat and it's vegan
cruelty free and paraben free so let's
give it a go I'm really interested so it
came in this note box and this is what
the product looks like so yeah this is
Brooklyn roller easy I learn it ink and
then when you open it up it's got the
tiniest little roll on it so now if you
guys can see but yeah it's got a really
tiny little roller on the end which is
really strange so we are very up close
and personal right now but I was even
doing so we can see exactly what's going
to go on with this okay I know that
there are brown other browsers that have
this eyeliner so I'm guessing it's like
a new thing well I don't know so I'm
gonna first of all draw a line out here
we're going to do one glider so I'm
gonna that bit was quite easy and don't
apply too much pressure I just did that
very lightly I actually just come out
really well so I did up a little
bit here but we'll fix up afterwards
it's now I'm gonna bring it back this
way like I just would with one or more
eyeliner
okay
it's just freezing it straight away it's
definitely I'd say harder it's harder to
use don't know what eyeliner
okay I think the key is to really apply
like hardly any pressure also I don't
think it works very well if you're gonna
bring your line of backwards I think I'm
gonna have to go this way here we try it
again this way do I think this is very
user friendly no I don't okay that was
better time
I think you've use somebody that already
struggles of a winged liner this is
going to make it even harder
honestly I don't find this any easier I
find it harder
actually quite hard to get a straight
line I think this wing looks the worst I
think it looks okay
okay I do think it works a little bit
easier if you pull the skin tight a
little bit while you roll it he says it
matte but not flat so but it's not much
it's actually quite shiny yeah I don't I
don't know about this
I mean it's 20 pounds as well so it's 20
pounds if you're not someone that's
advanced of winged liner or you're not
someone that does wings on it very often
you're gonna really shock with this I
feel like it's literally gonna make your
life ten times harder and it's really
hard to get a sharp edge on the end here
as well I mean it does work like it does
work but it's just really difficult when
I played 20 rounds for this no I
wouldn't pay 25 Bret I use this
Maybelline gel liner with a winged liner
brush an angled brush
and I just go one swipe that way one
swipe that way and fill it in and it's
so much easier this is way cheaper so I
mean no I would not pay 25 for this I'm
gonna try my other eye and see if I can
get these to match
Oh God
Ramona hi I'm ready stronger at this
side oh but I feel like a climbing brave
I think they want us to give up with
this side so I'm gonna take my normal
jawline on for this side because that
struggle was real right now
oh my god so much easier
okay so one thing I will say about it is
it is a very black it's a very black I
don't know which is really good because
some of them do dry down a little bit
more of a dark grey but this one is very
black it's not matte as always quite
shiny which is quite nice up today I
prefer a matte liner but the shining is
quite nice okay so I just put some of my
Maybelline gel liner on top I made this
a little bit thick I made it a bit more
matte because it was quite shiny and
stuck some lashes on I'm just here to
give my final one so I personally do not
think that this is very user friendly it
says easy eyeliner ink I read I think
it's easy at all I mean I would like to
say I'm quite good at eyeliner like I
didn't woman darling quite often I kind
of know exactly has to do it now and I
struggled with this I find it very
difficult to control and the eyeliner is
very black it's very black which is good
it doesn't drag our filling map dries on
quite shiny which I'm not a huge fan of
shiny when diner personally if you are
interested in try this out I will link
it below just in case you want to and
also if you do try out let me know your
opinions like what you think about it
but yeah personally it's a no from me
I just think stick to you know gels and
you know more liners so much easier
maybe I'm glad I gave it a go when he
makes us very interested in it and I
hope you guys enjoyed this video make
sure it's give me a thumbs up if you did

in my next video bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
