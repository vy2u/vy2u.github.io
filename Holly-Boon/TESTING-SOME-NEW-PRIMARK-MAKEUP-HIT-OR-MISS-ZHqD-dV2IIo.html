channel and hello if you're new here
welcome hi my name is Holly Boone so in
today's video I'm gonna be trying out
some new pro mic makeup I love trying
that Primark makeup I've tried out a few
things from there and I've been quite
impressed to be honest at the price and
the quality of the product so I always
go in there and just see if there's
anything new and I came across this so I
wanna try it out see what it's like the
first thing I picked up was this Bruns
shader shimmer eyeshadow palette and
this was 4 pounds and this is what it
looks like so I'm excited to try that I
actually swatched this in this store and
I was really shocked at how nice the
shadows look 5 matte shades and there's
two kind of like oily shades and then
two shimmers yeah I'm gonna stop with
the eyes Joe under eyes about Primark is
people come in there and they just stick
their fingers in all the makeup and just
then don't buy it and it's so
frustrating like this one was like
already opened and already whatever it
was the only one left and I was like I'm
just gonna have to get it like someone's
put their finger in that one but yeah
it's great really it's great I love a
bit of somebody else's fingerprint in my
eyeshadow it's brilliant
so for my base I'm gonna use the peeler
wheeze eyeshadow base this is so good
just the best place ever bottom of the
seat only since I've tried it I've not
gone back I'm not use anything else so
I'm gonna notice to carve up my brows
and use this as my caseta base I'm gonna
use my Sigma F 75 concealer brush so I'm
just gonna press this on my lid because
I want as much coverage as possible and
I don't want any brushstroke marks
because like not everybody can afford to
buy to spend money on makeup and not not
many people want to either specially
yeah especially if you don't have a lot
of spare money you don't want to be
spending loads of money when you don't
have to do you know it means yeah
finding some good makeup that's
affordable is this excited find really
exciting every excited by it
no five seven is really affordable and I
think it's really good I guess so
excited I let you tell my friends or
family I'm like you need to get it it's
so good it's so like inexpensive yeah
I'm gonna apply a little bit of this
under my eye as well because
I'm gonna do a halo I I'm going to just
put it up underneath not too much
because I just wanted for the shadow not
actually my concealer the from the
palette the first cut I'm gonna use is
this collar right hands dark color I'm
gonna place in the crease and I'm going
to use my blank canvas a 42 brush
actually picking up quite a lot of the
color I'm just gonna press this on in my
crease I'm just above the crease as well
I'm also bringing it I'm gonna bring it
all the way in okay it's not the most
pigmented shadow in the world I feel
that we can build this up next I'm going
to go for this color right here on my
Sigma e30 a brush and I'm going to apply
this just above that color again I'm
just going to press it on and then I'm
gonna blend I'm gonna go back and
forwards in a minute but I'm just laying
the color down first so now I'm just
gonna do circular motions and go
backwards and forwards to blend our Jim
I love about this eyeshadow base is it
makes so much different to any eyeshadow
just gonna give us that dark color I'm
gonna just talk a bit more the one thing
I am struggling with a little bit it's
just here on the outer corner don't you
can say just that it's just it's just a
little bit hard to blend it's kind of
what's stuck then it won't blend okay so
I really like how that actually looks
and so far but I do want to deepen up
the inner corner and the outer corner
and through the crease and there's no
darker shade in here that I could use so
that I'm gonna just pick her akshay from
a different palette I'm going to use my
morphe M 502 and I'm gonna use this
shade right here and the bottom reason
is the two three four locks smokey
shader brush to finish it out corner I'm
gonna bring it up through the crease as
well and you know corners are then I'm
going to go back to the Primark palette
and that first dark color that I used
the edge
you know put this shade all where along
the bottom lash line okay next thing I'm
going to do is I'm gonna cut the crease
I'm gonna use my pedals base again and
the same brush
now after that I'm going to try out this
shade right here from this prymaat
palette your champagne e gold I'm just
gonna press that on top of that base the
shadow is really nice
okay so then I'm gonna go back to that
showed from the morphe palette on this
brush and I'm gonna go over the edge I
picked up from Primark this loose
highlight oh it was only two pounds and
it's in the shade vacation and I kind of
way to use it as instead of a highlight
as an eyeshadow so I'm gonna tie some of
this over the top of that it's gonna
like a pinky rose color great I've just
poured it all over me right on honey
look what I've just done what the
why am I like this please I'm gonna
spray my brush with some fix+
and then I'm gonna pick up some of this
on this brush and I'm gonna apply it on
top of that foiled shadow they do have a
more of a gold shades that I would use
as a highlight by just fine loose
pigment highlight is really messy but I
do think they're really good as like and
eye shadow a little bit more I really
loved that on top of that I think it's
really got brightened up a bit more and
I think it explained eyes but yeah like
I said these top of like loose pigment
highlights I like to use them for
eyeshadow personally I find them really
messy like I literally just bought that
everywhere I cannot do I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna finish up this eye and then
I'll just do that I quickly off camera
and then I'll come back so let's finish
up this one whilst I kind of just focus
on this eye anyway but yeah so I'm gonna
use my NYX final liquid liner and I'm
gonna line my lashline with this also
when I was in Primark I saw these 3d
iconic bowls eyelashes not only to power
and they look exactly like the ones that
I would normally were so I'm gonna give
these a go as well I'm gonna use my
house of lashes eyelash glue I'm really
my ask to drive for a second I'm gonna
finish off my bottom lash line so I'm
gonna price them jaw line up but then
I'm gonna bring it to
stay below the waterline on the lashline
I'm gonna get back with him for his I
kind of smoke out the lower lash line I
love smoked out the lower lash lines off
everything okay so this is done I'm
gonna just do my other eye off camera
because it'll be so much quicker so I'll
be back in well I don't know how long
it's gonna take me but for you be 90
seconds never finished my other eye
off-camera I haven't done bottom
muscaria who cares
I'm gonna wait tough time what concealer
and stuff I've also just primed my skin
I use my wire cell towers primer this
problem is so good for minimizing pores
and also keeps me all free for like
hours it's I swear by it it's so good so
for my foundation I'm going to use my
Mac foundation
I'm gonna use my perfect color long-wear
ultimate matte foundation this one is
kind of like a dupe for the Estee Lauder
I did a video I compare the two and you
couldn't tell a difference at all
and this one's only five pounds and I'm
gonna mix in some of my semi matte
finish vitamin E medium coverage
foundation which is from Primark again
and this one was to around 50 so yeah
I'm just gonna mix these two together
because I don't want to look too much
anything else so primer I finally just
like the shade range is porous Park see
if you're darker than me or lighter than
me they do do these like drops and you
can put your foundation so they do like
dark or dark but oh and like a light
ball and you can put the drops in your
foundation it even light and do it with
darkness
I don't know if that's actually any good
but I think it's definitely worth trying
because it's so inexpensive see you
could try and see if it works if you
have done it before comment below and
let me know what you think let everyone
else know what you think if you think it
works if you for the drop said and
whether that's like really helpful
see I'm just gonna press this in with my
Beauty Blender I'm so glad my sunburnt
forehead is going down because it was so
sunburned I'll it she looked like I had
a bright red forehead look crazy my
forehead is so big
that is there's no one way what sunburn
it's a jacket size I used to get
cool big forehead I'm big got pointy
chin that's cool so now I like when
people try say oh you've got big void
you got a pretty chair I'm like I know
I've had it my whole life
one thing about doing one eye and then
doing the other eye is they never look a
hundred percent symmetrical when you do
that I don't know what it is that you do
the exact same process the exact same
steps but they still look different so
annoying conceal I'm just gonna use my
Laura Mercier oxygen wear concealer
she's like I love this concealer so much
it's my ride-or-die
so hydrate and it just feels really
really nice and comfortable and it's a
good coverage as well I used to show 3w
that if I do want to brighten up my
under eye stuff a little bit more I will
add in a bit of 2w as well which I'm
gonna do in a sec I'm a good concealer
if you're on a budget as well is the
Maybelline age rewind and they've got
like they've got more shades in it
finally I still don't for it there's
enough shades but they do bring up more
shades so if you've not tried at a
definitely recommend trying it you might
have to mix two or something it's really
annoying but it is a good concealer it's
affordable so first was gonna take this
brush this is my morphe doesn't have a
number on it so no um I'll just get
softer than this edge here because I
don't wanna ruin the under eye I finally
went back to long they always I had a
break for a long time and just have my
nails with acrylic relay by got
extensions again because extensions just
 when hours because I used to
capture their one things and I'd like
just my now so bad well yeah I gave
my now as a break for probably like a
month we longer actually and today I was
like no I want them back long and I felt
I've literally missed them so much I
love having them longer but it's just
yeah catches on things I catch someone
things all the time it's you oldest huh
it's so annoying so I'm going to use my
Laura Mercier translucent powder that
way under oh okay
so from this Brahms collection from
primark I picked up this matte bronzer
this was 2 pound and this in the shades
of sunrise to be honest I feel like this
is probably gonna be slightly gray I
don't know I'm gonna see what it looks
like on the skin because sometimes it's
different on the skin but to me it looks
a little bit gray okay let's just try it
I'm just gonna pick some up on this
fluffy brush so yeah it is
better on the skin then it looks in the
pan that happens okay sometimes they
like pressed powders are different in
the pan so when you put them on the skin
it still does have a slightly gray gray
undertone so I'd say anything I'm gonna
use that I'm gonna go in my mac
mineralize skinfinish because I love
this stuff to bronze up but yeah I
thought that might be a little bit
better as more of a contour shade
because it's not too gray
definitely not as a bronzer I don't
think not for me anyway I like quite a
warm bronzer so yeah I just wait to see
if it would be any different on the skin
the planet is slightly different it's
not as grey let's get it the minute that
she changes like the year
however one minute Raven Brennan one
minute Sonny
one minute Cody one minute Hale in a
minute snow in Kyle keep up it's not my
skin one minute Whaley one minute dry
one me I don't even know okay so it just
applies some bottom mascara so next
thing I've got is this radiant glow
highlight ah this was two pound fifty I
like the nice primer color I had it was
like in a um like a palette and I was
like four shades and it was like the
gold one and I loved it okay the
highlight is nice but I would say it's
kind of a little bit powdery but it's
nice it is nice what shade it says this
shade is moonlight beam I feel like I've
already had this I feel like I've
already tried this before
yeah I like that I think it looks really
nice it's really buildable as well so
you could have it subtle if you want or
you can just keep adding it of course
I'm gonna keep adding it next thing I
picked up from their bronze collection
this is a bronze in face and body butter
but it's like in a compact this was to
power 15 this is the shade golden and I
kind of just like swirled my thing
you're in and it is actually like a body
butter but in a in a in a compact it's
really like I don't know it like but if
you guys can see but it's like yeah
literally a body bar and it smells so
nice and when I pass on this to my body
why not when you use this little stipple
brush from Mac okay so just put the
camera down a bit I'm just going to
apply this here and look at that oh my
god that's really nice let me try this
it smells really nice it smells like
coconut okay I really like that yeah
it's literally a body butter in a
compact it's got a mirror it's soup I'm
50
so I'm gonna line my lips with my Rimmel
London lip liner in the shade blushing
nude I should have got a lip from her
Mac I do have a pulse actually that I
like and I'm gonna apply some West
Sephora liquid lipsticks and the shade
75 and now on top of that I'm gonna put
this peach shine lip gloss from Primark
on the top I love this gloss I can't
live without lip gloss honestly you guys
I feel it when I do my makeup for a day
wear lip gloss I just think I literally
waited
okay so overall I'm actually really
impressed with the products I tried the
only thing I don't like is the bronzer
because it has a slight gray undertone
to it so it's a little bit ashy and it
might be okay to contour not sure and if
you're a bit lighter than me a probably
better to contour I didn't think of the
very good contour on me but yeah I don't
really like that as a bronze is not warm
enough for me and the isolate point was
really nice I think those photos are the
better than the Mertz
the mutts are nice but it takes quite
all blending and I feel like I still
couldn't blend just here because it kind
of got a little bit stark like stuff
I can blend it out but I do think they
are a good pigment for four pounds and
especially the oil shadow that I put in
the center I also love this loose
pigment highlight and let me just try
this for an actual highlight and so
happens why not because this is the one
that I put over the top of that flute I
don't really like it we just put some up
okay that is so nice on the skin kind of
melts into the skin it's really not -
the only thing I have the only problem I
have with loose pigment highlights is
they're just messy but that's really
nice look at that okay / I love that
they also do a gold burn in there which
is really nice but yeah this is that
pink like a pinky rose gold one I also
love this highlight as well but I would
say it's a little bit more powdery so if
you kind of more of a subtle highlight
this one's going to be really nice for
you but you can also build up as well if
you like more of a Beeman highlight or
if you just do what I did and just put
that on on top and then it makes it like
be me and it will set up this from
primer as well which is the bronze in
face and body butter I just zoomed you
out which yeah that's what it looks at
on the skin it looks really really nice
it smells really good and I've never
ever seen like a body butter in a
compact before like that's just like I'm
confused how that works but it does work
it looks good he's less messy as well
which I like you can use a brush and
just apply it I really like that I was
only - 550 but yeah see I hope you guys
enjoyed this video make sure to give it
a thumbs up if you did please subscribe
and let me know if you've tried any of
these products and what you think and
