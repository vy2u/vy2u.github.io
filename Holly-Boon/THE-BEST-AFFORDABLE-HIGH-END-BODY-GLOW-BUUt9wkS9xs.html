channel and hello hi if you are new here
my name is Holly Boone welcome so in
today's video I'm gonna be showing you
some different body glows I did the body
guy video on the body lava from fenty BC
and then I asked you guys if you want me
to show you more options so some
affordable ones some high-end ones just
like a mixture of both and you guys said
yes so that's what I'm going to show you
today and so yeah I've got really
affordable ones and I've got some that
are a little bit pricier I'm just gonna
let you know the detail on the mall some
of them more glittery some of them are
more of like a sheen some of them have a
fragrance some of them one of them two
body butter I'm going to show you them
all okay show them all so I'm gonna
start with the sparkly ones these ones I
have glitter in them so if you're
looking for more likely to relook these
ones are perfect I have three here and
they range from like really really
inexpensive to really high-end so the
first one is the sunset goddess body
shimmer this is actually from Primark
and this is three pound fifty and
literally look how gorgeous this is so
nice it's got a really nice fragrance to
it it smells really really nice if so if
you love a fragrance you're absolutely
love this it's almost like a perfume you
smell
you just spray onto the skin I'm going
to show you spray it on and then rub it
in and it's got little it's really hard
for you to see on camera that's the most
annoying thing when you're out in the
sunshine like when you're out in just
about normal daylight you can see it
really well it's just got little bits of
gold glitter in it and it picks up
really really nice in the sunshine and
it has a really really nice fragrance
and this one is only three perfectly
from Primark it's a bargain it's so so
good and so yeah that's a really really
good one if you are on a budget and you
want a one that's got a bit of sparkle
in it really hard for you guys to see on
camera when it comes to the sparkly ones
when I show you the other ones which are
more like a sheen it shows up really
really well and you guys we have to see
but when it comes to the sparkly ones
they show up the best in like sunlight
or natural daylight the next one I have
is the Hawaiian Tropic golden paradise
the fragrant mist shimmer Edition and
this is warm Sun and creamy coconut this
smells like holiday this brand is a lot
of sunscreens
like we always it using holiday and it
has that same smell it smells so good
smells so so good so yeah this one is
similar to the Primark one it has the
gold flecks in it and you just spray it
all over so I'm gonna spray it yeah it
literally smells like the lotions that
you get from this brown on holiday it
smells so so good and again it has the
little bits of gold so yeah that is that
one and that one again is more of a
mystery every body as the Shema I'm not
really like a sheen more of a glitter so
if you like more likely to relook you
will love this one as well and yeah this
is the Hawaiian Tropic golden paradise
fragrance mist shimmer Edition and I got
this from Superdrug so yeah that's that
one yeah and this one was ten pounds
from superdrug so the next one I'm gonna
talk about this thing goes anybody wants
to splurge it if what anyone wants to
spend a little bit more money because I
am something that loves love's love's of
loves a bargain I'm sure most people do
but there are some people that love
high-end so I'm gonna show you this one
as well so this is a Tom Ford shimmering
body oil
this is gorgeous
I do love this I do love this but it is
pricey I think it was about 70 to 80
pounds I can't remember and but I was
just like it was sat there and I think
it was House of Fraser Selfridges and I
was like you know what I really I really
need it I need it and it just looks so
gorge
and this is what it looks like and this
is kind of like a mixture of like it's
more oily than those other two those
other two kind of like dry this is more
like a an actual oil with sparkle in it
and it does look gorge
so so so those lone eyes but it is
pricey and it also smells so good like
it smells next up also I'm gonna spray
someone this side of my chest so you
guys can see what I mean so yeah as you
can see it's more oily than the other to
the other two and more of dry like a dry
oil this is an oily oil do you know I
mean you know I mean it has got bits of
sparkle in it as well and it just
so so nice and it smells like the Tom
Ford perfumes it smells really really
nice if you are somebody that prefers
high-end and likes to splurge then this
is going to be perfect for you right
it's so so good okay so I'm not gonna
talk about ones that give you more of a
sheen like a healthy glow rather than a
glitter I personally prefer a product
that gives me more of a sheen rather
than a guesser but that's just me anyway
the first one is this face and body
highlighting cream strobe cream this is
from Primark and this is three pounds so
I'm just gonna put them on my hand and
rub it in and I'm gonna show you what it
looks like I'm just gonna put it on my
shoulder so you guys can see it smells
really really nice it's only three
pounds and it gives you more of a as you
can see it gives you more of a sheen
like a healthy like glow rather than a
pizza
that's what that one looks like and this
was only three pounds the only thing I
feel like because it's quite small we
improve on out quite fast but then it's
only three pounds you can just get a
couple of them but yeah that's what that
one looks like so as you can see it's
more of a get a more of a glow of the
glitter which I love so that's the first
one and that's the pro mark strobe face
and body highlighting cream okay so the
next one is the sole a shimmer oil and
this one was I think this was three
pounds as well or around about that and
I love this this reminds me of oil that
I used to have from dove it was like a
dove body oil I can't find it anywhere
anymore I don't think they do it anymore
which is so annoying because it was so
so so nice but this is literally the
exact same thing and so it's more of a
like a shimmer and a sheen rather than a
glitter which is exactly what I like and
it's more like his hand color I'm just
going to pour some in my hands and I'm
just gonna put some of this on this side
of my chest so you guys can see yes this
one's more about like glowy sheen kind
of look like a shimmer but not lesser
and it just looks so nice so the
difference between the Tom Ford one and
this one when you put on the skin isn't
look that March I suppose like when you
go out in the natural day like this one
pretty have a little bit more glitter in
it but I personally just prefer it to
look like this anyway I don't
too much glitter in my body oils I
prefer them just give me that healthy
kind of shiny glow um but yeah this one
was three pounds fifty or three pounds
or something from super drug and it's so
nice like it's so so good especially
this on the Front's of your legs we look
amazing like phenomenal it says on the
back of the bottle shimmer in it oil
illuminates your skin by providing an
even golden shimmer this lightweight
formula adds a touch of summer to your
skin and is enriched with vitamin E
argon sweet almond and rose hip oil is
to help moisturize and condition your
skin suitable for use of a natural town
ourselves town and it does it smells
really really nice but yeah so that's
that one I personally I thought that one
is probably my favorite out of the lower
end ones and that one is just like what
I love in a body oil to be honest just
like a shimmer not a blister
so if you're like me and that's what you
prefer then definitely go to Superdome
and get that once it's in three pounds
50 or something and it's so good okay so
the next one is a radius and body glow
cream this is the high glow the high
intensity go by Rochelle Humes who I
think was one of the Saturdays I'm right
I'm wrong and I'm sorry and this is what
this one looks like so this is actual
like a body butter so I'm just gonna put
some in my hands and I'm gonna put this
one down my arm so with this one it kind
of gives you a tint of color when you
apply it and it is like more of a cream
rather than a coil or yeah it's it she's
just like a body butter with like a like
a glow to it and it is really really
nice the only thing I would say if you
do have lighter skin than me it's
probably not gonna be the best because
it just it does have a tint of like a
bronzy color that you'd have to put it
all over to make it look even and but if
you do have like a tan from holiday or
if you are darker than me this one is so
nice this one's really really nice it
dries down nicely it has a real nice
smell as well and it says on the back
here for show-stopping glows move on to
the skin concentrate on arms legs
and deku don't know what that says then
I want that says done what it says and
then it says enrich your skin with this
Lux high-intensity formula this
specifically created skin perfecting
cream hydrates and illuminates even you
the warm flawless globe suitable for all
skin tones so yeah this one does have
attentive colors to it and it's more
body butter it does give you that really
nice Sheen that really nice glow without
the glitter and just a really nice
healthy look but yeah it does have
because it has it enough color if I
think if you're like really really light
skinned that you're gonna have to apply
most areas but it's gonna kind of add
like a tint of quality and skin it does
wash off fine but I just yeah gray so
lastly this is two products that I love
this is these are from ICONic London
this is the prep set of gly from iconic
London which I've been using religiously
lately I really really love it it does
set so this is perfect if you do put
like a body sheen on and you want to
just set it in a way so you dominate to
like kind of like transfer or anything
like that then this is perfect it really
does set that and it does add a little
bit more glow and it does have a little
bit of sparkle to it but it's kind of
more of like a sheen always say so I'm
just gonna spray some of this on it also
smells so so good when it comes to my
face with this product I try not to
apply too much of it the reason being is
because because it does still have that
kind of a little bit of a sparkle kind
of Sheen and I because I get oily from
the day I don't really like to put too
much on my face but I do like it on the
face especially on top of the
illuminator drops to speak about next
but yeah so that's that one which I look
like sweaty right now I just things away
for it to dry I'm actually covered in
body dries right now I let you look
sweaty base because I've just put so
many on top of each other but I am
low-key kind of might live before anyway
I kind of like it I'm just I just like
it anyway so the last one I'm going to
talk about is the iconic London
illuminator drops I love these because
they're so Universal like you can
actually use these in so many different
ways and I can use this is your
highlight you can mix it with your
foundation you can use underneath your
foundation you can mix it with your
moisturizer and put on your body you can
just do so much with this
this one little polite and it will last
you so long all you need is literally
one little drop of this mixing with your
moisturizers I put it on everybody and
it's next level I used it all last
summer this one little bottle I did get
a new one they sent me a new one but I
did have my old one for over a year and
it still wasn't clear on out crazy so
this product is I think 30 pounds for
these drops but they last youth forever
I promise they last so so long and it's
so worth the fake pounds so what I like
to do with these ones when it comes to
the body is mix it in with some
moisturizer I like to use the nourishing
body lotion this is the Neutrogena one
this is for normal to dry skin so it's
really really nourishing moisturizer I
don't actually have dry skin but I just
like it because it's very nourishing
so put some moisturizer on the back of
my hand like that and then I'm gonna put
some drops in the moisturizer so I'm
going to do a couple of drops I'm gonna
mix it in I used the shade original by
the way in these drops so yeah this is
what I do is I mix it in with my
moisturizer this is what it looks like
on the back of my hand and I don't know
where I'm gonna put this off Phillip
I've run out of air let's just rub it on
my hand so you can see what it looks
like because I feel I cannot add more to
my chest or my arms so this is what it
looks like on the back of my hand so as
you can see it's so nice you only have
to add a couple of drops into your
moisturizer and if you put this all over
your body so like your arms legs just
any way you want it just gives you that
really help it go it just looks so
phenomenal over the town or even if
you're not tan it looks amazing and and
it's just something that I just can't
live about what you guys are just
something that I really cannot live
without honestly especially in the
summer is something that I live for and
I just I like looking like I have really
healthy glowy skin it's just I feel like
everyone loves it you must love it it's
just the best thing but yeah so that's
what that looks like on the back of my
hair and say yeah that's just a sheen
there's absolutely no blister in this
whatsoever which I love no glitter it
just gives you a healthy glow like that
so I mean the glittery ones for me I
kind of like ones that I found being a
bit more extra and I wear it like just
put it on top if I'm going out for
dinner
with a little bit of glitter but they're
not really something that I really
really love when it comes to
at the site more that Sheen so this type
of thing like with the shoulder and here
rather then you can't really see the
glitter at the moment on my arm you
can't really see it but in the daylight
when I look right of course I can see
the little bits of gold glitter see this
side where it has like the little bits
of gold glitter it's just something that
I would add if I was going out for
dinner in the evening or whatever but
when it comes to daytime and I want to
go down to the pool with a bikini I want
to look really nice and healthy and the
iconic London illuminator drops in with
the moisturizer or or this one which is
the sole a shimmer oil which is 3.50
this one is amazing so so nice I love
that so yeah those are some options for
you guys
so you don't have to spend a lot if you
don't want so you can get some really
really good body oils and body cameras
and stuff anywhere like I swear to see
them everywhere you can just make your
own like me just add some illuminate
drop some of your moisturizer that works
just as well as well so yeah I hope you
