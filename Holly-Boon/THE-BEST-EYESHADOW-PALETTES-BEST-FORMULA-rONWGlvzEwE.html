youtube channel and say they had to or
assumed a video on my favorite go to ice
on those formulas palates in through
your eyes I know is just one but I think
if I were surprised I'm just so good so
that's I'm going to do today if you are
new here it's nice to meet you across
human earth nice to meet you make sure
you subscribe and I know let's crack on
crack on this is in no particular order
I'm just going to go through these and
so the first one I'm going to talk about
is the modern renaissance palette from
1000 of your heels my it's absolutely
ruined like it's actually covered in
makeup so yeah this is what the page
looks like mine like this is covered in
makeup but it's like this is suede
material which I'm not a huge fan of
because I feel like it feels like you
know a new scratcher nails on a
blackboard and it makes you go this what
this makes me feel like you know I mean
it makes me feel funny so I don't react
the packaging being honest and it does
get messy and but this is the palette
and using the shades it's just a really
really nice warm palette I use these
three shades quite a lot this one is a
really nice shade for work the lid which
I use quite often and this one here I
use a lot for the inner corner of my eye
and the brow bones highlight and then
this one I use a lot for a transition
color but this is such a gorgeous warm
up palettes you've got the Reds you've
got the orange browns and a couple of
purple shades I just think it's such a
gorgeous play and it's so worth the
money it's super pigmented and so easy
to blend so if you did want to splurge
on a palette then I'd highly recommend
this one okay so next is the urban decay
and make it heat palette I was shocked
when I tried this because so many people
and there were squatches go money isn't
it when this first came out and everyone
saying that it was bad and that swatches
it was not pigmented and swatch it looks
bad I'm not gonna lie I think some we
just did that on purpose just to be like
and ing I mean just to be honest because
this palette is so bomb the colors are
to die for
I've been I've been using this palette
so much recently like I've been using
this palette non-stop it's been the one
that I've been grabbing and I love the
shades so many warm
they put some plummy shades I use this
show quite a lot which is cool sauce I
use I quite off my transition color and
in the crease and today back today we're
just want to wear eyelashes and I just
want to have a little bit on my eye I
just use that color in the crease of
what the crease a little bit but this
palette is so gorgeous the shimmer
shades are so pigmented and also the
matte shades I'll do a couple of
swatches for you so you can see so here
is a couple of swatches of the shimmer
shades these are so pigmented so creamy
so blendable it's so nice it's so so
nice and then I'll just watch a much
show for you
okay so here is one of the matte shades
they are so so nice so pretty I just
love this palette it's a really really
good warm palette so again if you want
to splurge on a palette then this one is
so worth the price and it's so so nice
you're like I said it's been one of my
actually go to use recently okay next
next one oh you know next palette is
this one and this is from Julia's plays
this packaging is to die for it so so so
so so so so pre I'm obsessed I love the
packaging so much I really her on fluids
and ok so these are the shades in this
palette this one is the magic palette
they have a few pilots but now the
beauty boat which is so nice but the pan
size is so good by the way I like the
size of these eyeshadows is just amazing
for the price also they are so pigmented
so creamy so blendable these are some of
the most pigmented eyeshadows I've ever
used in my whole life I kind of explain
I put the Chinese bit on my brush and I
get so much pigment and like minimal
fallout so these are those are just
 bottom I'll do some swatches and
show you so I love this palette I love
the shades in this palette is so
versatile and I just would never think
clearly shows in the palette and I'm
just obsessed so I'm ready some swatches
and show you what it like okay so this
is one of the floral shadows and it this
is one swipe they're so pigmented the
most pigmented item it adds up I love
you to screen before I use this palette
in my two displays
oh I did a cut crease I use the screen
and it's so pigmented it's a joke like
this you can even see like Luster's once
why it's actually a joke public which of
these arts I'll do a swatch of one of
the matte shades so here it was the
matte shades from the palette yeah as
you can see they are just so opaque and
just so creamy it's just a gorgeous
palette the shades are amazing the PAL
size is amazing and you get a lot for
your money and also the packaging is so
cute
like I love the packaging so yeah this
is another bombers fast politics I'm
going to talk about the morphe palette
these palettes are just super affordable
you get so many shades to money like so
many shades if you just want one palette
like if you're just like eyes with one
palette of those of shades then you need
to get a mortgage lighter because these
are so inexpensive and sorry
fault I'll show you these two are my
favorite and we've got the 3500m which
is all matte warm shades and then equal
to 35 P which is all plum shade and a
few shimmers in there so with the 35 om
actually really low so you just got like
a huge range of warmth a to you but
orange warm Browns neutrals as well in
here you've also got a few cool tone
rails as well which is good but if this
overall like quite a warm color and and
this is the 35 om you get 35 OS which is
the same palette but with shimmer shades
and then you can also get the 3500 which
is just a mixture of the two it's a mix
of the mats undersheriff I prefer this
palette with just this dish the matte
I'm not a huge fan of the shimmer
eyeshadow in the palette from morphe
local not massive fan of them I do love
the matte shades so this palette is
actually one of my absolute favorites
haven't used it in a long time which is
crazy I think you just could have so
many palettes that I love I just I don't
know I kind of forget about this one
sometimes but this one is so so so good
if you want a warm palette anyone I
dread the next one is the 5p palette
which is all these plums shades and some
cool tone Brown some neutrals and yes
you've got a mixture in here of a shoe
myth and mats and then this is like my
go-to palette if I want to do like a
plummy
smokey eye or if I want to do purples on
my eyes this one others are quite often
look at that a lot huge fan of the
shimmer shades that's just been honest
they just don't work the best for me but
I do love the my shades so yeah you want
to realize plum palette and this one is
for you and this is a say 5p from food
ok next one more thing I want to talk
about their field pressed pigment these
are to die for
I if you just want to buy a few you know
you just wanna buy a few Sundays but you
don't buy palette then these are so if
I've explained up on these almost
watching to show you this is my absolute
favorite color and this is in the shade
Rodeo Drive
I use these press segments so much
because they're just just wait again for
this what started once what this is one
swipe okay this photo is to die for
they come in so many different shades
are really affordable like I said so
creamy super pigmented the only problem
I have with them is I break them so
easily like I dropped my share all the
time I'm so clumsy and I've dropped a
pop of these and smash them and I've had
to rebuy them and which is someone ways
to be really really careful with these
but they are so oh I love them so if you
want to get a map I'd say just get like
a matte and matte palette from morphe
35o and then you could just get like a
couple of things for shadows to go on
the lid and but c'est bon so i've said
bombs i mean i think hang a so
bomb up okay so next i'm going to talk
about this Z palette this is a new one
I've got another one that's just full of
warm trays but I thought I would like
the warm todas person enough of that and
show you some color so this is my V
palette with makeup geek eyeshadows and
these big pans are from morphe so I love
makeup the eyeshadows and I love the
fact that you can choose from so shades
that you want you can create your own
palette I think that's so good if you
don't want to buy like a whole palette
and if you see a hot palette and you
don't like all to show you like I feel
like action that side like I think it's
so good that makeup do this because like
I said you can create your own palette
yeah I want to watch a few of the shades
I've got a few months in here
a couple of I think that one is Shimla
it's not a field in our consumer and
that was a field so I do a couple
switching to show you and then these big
pans are from morphe which are so good
like the difference in parents lights
from makeup geek Denorfia is so good but
nope you don't have as many shades main
cupcake I'm a cupcake every
change you ever need okay makeup geeks
has come the through that every
single shade effort okay
come on find a shade of eyeshadow from
makeup geek then it doesn't
exist it sure did but it's such a
favorite of mine when green and one is
quite often I just love greens under
this this are in my own issues like an
obsession I have at the moment but I
love to show you so much this is in the
shade dirty martini
so I'll do it with scotch so this is
actually a dirty martini you can see
it's super pigmented and that's what
once what this makeup you guys on this
are just so creamy is so easy to use if
you're a good first eyeshadow you're not
the best at blending and I really highly
recommend makeup geek cuz I find that
the shades blend together so well the
formulas over - a dirty martini and then
I'll swatch a full-of-shit show you so
this shade here is will make up bigness
in the shade hot pants and this isn't a
fluid this is more like a metallic II
kind of like shimmer and it's so so nice
I don't even ever used to show before
I've had this in here for ages and ever
used and I don't know why because I love
that
that looks so bomb so I'm definitely use
that soon I do think makeup geek is
really affordable
I do but if you start by an OG shades as
soon as I'll make it soon it becomes
really expensive so in that aspect it's
not really that inexpensive tonight
works by Hollywood century like it's
expensive my absolute go to Shea from
makeup geek for transition color is
Peach Smoothie I recently hit pan on my
other one I smashed it so I had my new
one but I love peach losing it just
really has two blends out and sometimes
if I apply a transition color it's
slightly too dark I'm like allspark like
it you can see where come out my
concealer for my brows and then you can
see like where my eyes on who starts I
like haven't seen this men so I always
go in with Peach Smoothie from makeup
geek and it
resources they blend it out so yeah
teach me the makeup week is a really
good transition color I would say for
most this skin toners Pietschmann will
be really good for you these are the
photo sellers but in a pan and like I
said I use the ones the pressed pigments
ones the individuals in the case but
I've never actually use these ones I'm
going to swatch this one which is called
hooks which is like I'm really gorgeous
gold shades you know I said this is the
shade hooks this is the photo of shadow
from makeup geek in pan and the packet
of the pan size is huge but that's the
one that's a Rodeo Drive which is the
pressed pigment is that one and this one
is supported oh and honestly they're
both so nice so just go with whatever
cheaper eyewear if this one's cheaper
then go to the pan because you get a lot
of product the Paradise is the same size
as this one yes those are like my top
eyeshadows these the ones I go to a lot
I think are so worth the money and if
you want to splurge or some higher-end
palettes in there and then if you're on
a budget then I would go for sort of
makeup geek and morphe yes those are
ones I just think of so worth your money
and you may be disappointed with and I
love them and yeah if you guys enjoyed
