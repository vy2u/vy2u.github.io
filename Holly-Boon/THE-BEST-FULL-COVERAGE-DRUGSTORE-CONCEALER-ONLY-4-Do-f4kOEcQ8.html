channel if you're new here and hello
welcome hi my name is Lee boon so today
I'm going to be doing a video all about
the new makeup revolution concealers
which I'm really excited to try I went
to Superdrug yesterday and picked up a
few shade it says that it's a
lightweight yet full coverage concealer
to cover blemishes even skin tone and
counteract dark circles and it's also a
matte finish so I've got the shades C 4
C 5 C a and C 14 C 14 is the darkest one
and that one's gonna be for me to
contour with and but these ones C 4 C 5
C 8 I just didn't know what shed I
wanted so I got all three so I'm gonna
start by doing my base because I haven't
done my foundation yeah so I'm gonna pry
my skin
I'm gonna use my fancy Beauty profile
primer yeah like I didn't even know that
they had this concealer and then someone
tweeted me saying have you tried this
yet and I was like no I should experi
you know I love a full coverage so I ran
super drive and I was over I'm getting
up
I'm gonna use my Fanny foundation I know
I reached it uses because it does break
me out in spots but it's just it's like
so nice I just love how it looks on my
skin so I'm just gonna have to risk it
in spots because I love it and this is a
damp sponge this is my Sigma sponge one
thing I will say about these concealers
is the shade range is not the best it
kind of jumps and also the undertones on
the best I mean I picked up a few shades
because some of them looked quite pinky
but yeah the shade range isn't the best
it jumps from like a few light shades
and then it just kind of goes really
dark and I'll see I still think the real
dark ones aren't gonna be right for
people with skin tone it just looked a
bit like because those are kind of
contour shades and they just look a bit
too cool my actual contour shades so
it's like I don't know how you would
conceal with that okay so I'm gonna
swatch these on my hand first you can
see what the shades actually look like
so the first one is c4 which is the
lightest shade that I picked up and I
feel like it's definitely gonna be way
too light but just we're applying it on
my armor like I did in this in
shop it's very full coverage yeah so
this is the show to c4 which is light
but it's got a pinky undertone to it
okay so this is the shade c5 it still
has a tiny tiny tiny pinky on the type
more of peachy undertone I would say but
it's a lot more yellowy than that one
that one's very thing and then c8 I
picked up a darker one because sometimes
I don't like a really light on do i yeah
again this one again it's got a peachy
undertone to it this one is a little bit
more pinky actually than this one so I
think I'm gonna go for the middle shade
because that one's even though it's
darker it's actually more pinky and more
peachy that one's way too light for me
and also way too pink but that one I
feel I will be fine
so I'm gonna go with that one which was
c5 so let's give this a go so yeah I'm
using the shade c5 I like the applicator
it's got big like doe foot applicator I
feel like it's this applicator is quite
similar to the tart shape tape so that
we know just applies under my eyes
sometimes I find when I use cheap of
concealers they sometimes sting my eyes
but this one's fine isn't a stinging my
eyes yet okay so as you can see it is a
full coverage you don't need a lot of
product to get like a good amount of
coverage I'm just gonna apply some this
down the bridge of my nose as well and
then a little bit on my chin so I'm
gonna take my stick my sponge to blend
this in okay you know what I actually
really like this I really like this
concealer this is bended out so nice and
it's keeping the coverage because
sometimes what I thought I was some
concealers is it would say it's more
coverage and although I'm really full
coverage and then when you're going with
a sponge it takes away a lot of the
product and but this isn't
Oh My Goddess concealer looks so good
Joe what I will say this is very very
very similar to tar shake tape very very
similar you get the same amount of
coverage
it applies just as nice honestly I hope
you want me to gets heart shaped tape
and compare it to this and we'll do one
side touch legs at once like this I will
do that but um shirk I'm actually shook
now I've blended this concealer al I
don't think it looks peachy at all I
think it's actually blended in really
nice okay so as you can see it blends in
really well it's very full coverage it
feels really nice and the skin doesn't
feel cakey it doesn't feel heavy I'm
honestly really shocked and I'm really
like I said might know because this is
so much like the touch tank tape and
it's 34 pounds I wanna see sure I think
this might be my new favorite concealer
I'm gonna obviously see how it weighs
four out of the day see if it creases
already for not that but just from first
application of renting it in I think it
looks so nice
okay so I'm gonna contour now with this
shade which is the shade c14 I'll do a
swatch on my hands you can see the as
you can see this is quite a cool brown
shade it's not really like very warm
it's not very bold and it's kind of like
just quite cool so it's good habit for
contouring but the concealer I don't I
don't know I don't feel like good one
can apply a little bit of this to my
forehead under my cheek bone and then
put your line I'm gonna use my Mac ones
that a stiffer brush to blend this in
see how this blends in with a brush oh
my god you Alex so good
oh my god that literally looks so good
honestly just like shook I'm just like
what the hell I know like I always find
it's so hard to find really good
products that are just drugstore like I
have a few of my absolute favorites and
I always try and find a really good
drugstore because obviously we don't
want to be spending X amount on this and
that when it runs out so fast cuz I use
a lot of makeup so I always try and find
really good inexpensive makeup when I
find it so hard most of the time I'm
actually so shook at this concealer I
didn't expect it to be discard not gonna
lie cuz I like I said I struggle to find
good drugstore all the time okay so I'm
just going over with my sponge as well
cuz I just want to make sure it's nicely
bendin there's no like harsh line who
needs tart shave tape this is literally
the same it's even similar in the the
kind of packaging like the applicator is
similar and the like the too but the
thickness of the tubes life is really
similar as well so this is what the
concealer looks like I haven't set it
yeah it's starting to crease a little
bit but I haven't set it that's probably
why so I'm just gonna set the concealer
and then see how it looks
Joe what I've been trying to find a good
full coverage concealer for a long time
I do like my Maybelline age of my age
rewind it's very good to build too full
coverage but it's not full coverage on
the first application and then I end up
running out of the product so quickly
because I use a lot of it at a time
whereas this it's just like boom full
coverage straightaway you don't need to
build it up and again is for Kim four
pounds I'm just using my Beauty bakery
translucent powder to step by the way
even for contour and I really like that
shade to contour as well as you can see
it looks really smooth both sides it's
covered everything
it looks seamless I have no I have
nothing bad to say it looks so good
so I'm gonna just quickly finish up the
rest of my
face and then I will be back so overall
my thoughts on this concealer I honestly
think it could potentially be my
favorite drugstore concealer ever and I
know that's crazy because maybe narae's
eye has always been my favorite but I
think this is probably outdone it I am
actually so shocked but yeah I think
it's so so much as heart shaped tape
it's so full coverage it bends out
seamlessly it sets nice when you say it
doesn't oxidize
it looks really really really good I am
gonna come back in a few hours I'm gonna
give it five or six hours and I'm gonna
come back and just show you if I think
it's crease or if it's oxidized or
anything that's happened I'm just like I
need to go there tomorrow and pick up
this shade c5 and just pick up like 25
of them because I'm just yeah if you
want me to do a heart-shaped eight
versus this concealer then give this
video a thumbs up I'll be interested to
see if you want to see that because I am
just like 99% sure this is literally
gonna be exactly this ain't gonna be
exactly the same finish give exactly the
same coverage so if you want to see that
give this video a thumbs up and I will
come back in five hours five six hours
and show you what it looks like but so
far so good
see ya on the scene in a few hours
hey guys so I'm back five hours later
and yeah it still looks good to me is it
tiny bit of crease in here umm just
under the eye there but where I've used
my shadow you can't really tell that
much anyway um and I've got a little bit
of crease in there beside my nose but I
always get it there anyway cycle off
lines I always get that all the way down
here I'm even I would say I'm still
but yeah I think the casillo is perfect
so you can find your shade definitely
try it out let me know you all for us
