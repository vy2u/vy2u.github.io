decided to keep my hair short this is my
natural hair and just because I'm just
bored of the long hair just fancied a
change so I feel like I'm gonna roll
with the short hair
I don't know homeless in the last
probably five minutes and then I'll have
my extensions back in but obviously
anyway so this is a cute and a video I
haven't done one of these in so long I
honestly cannot remember the last time
going to queue in it I thought I'd feel
on my bed today I just like chilled you
know more chilled out so question one
what's your most embarrassing moment so
this is hard
there's loads of things coming to me
it's embarrassing but I think one of the
worst ones was when I was like I think I
was like 18 17 18 and he's here to this
club lightening my house and there's
like stairs you go down to get to the
dance floor over and then someone who
spilt the drink on the stairs
so I slipped ilex you fell downstairs
basically in front of everyone that's on
this dance floor I was so humiliated I
just went home it was so embarrassing
are you doing a meet-and-greet anytime
soon or during this year I don't
actually have one planned at the moment
I don't have one in the process but I do
really want to do one and when I want to
meet those two be a clove show and IMATS
this year it was actually so nice to
just talk to you because like I think a
lot of people were shocked that I'm like
just I think a lot of people think I'm
like stuck up or think I'm better than
other people then when people meet me in
person they're like oh my god like
you're nothing like that you're actually
really nice
I'm like no honestly they like I am just
a normal chilled out person I love
getting to know you guys and I like to
know things about you and I'm really
interested and what you get up to and
what you do so I love meeting you I talk
for England every time I meet someone
that's my subscribe bar I will talk to
them for like half an hour like with
these many great things you're supposed
to just be like hi picture by but I'm
like no I don't have a phone
of everyone that I made literally I'm so
interested I love listening to people
talk what's your favorite foundation and
best primer this is so difficult for me
because my skin changes so often I can
tell you like some days I'm really oily
some days I'm a bit oily sometimes I'm
dry like honestly my skin just odd
overnight
my skin changes constantly like today
I'm a bit dry yesterday I was a bit oily
last week I was so oily like last week
it was a joke so it's hard for me to
find foundation like one foundation I
absolutely love because my skin is
constantly changing so I am still yet to
find a Holy Grail foundation my Holy
Grail foundation but it's only one thing
that's wrong with it
why I can use it all the time is the Mac
Studio Fix fluid is perfect for both
skin types and it's full coverage it
doesn't feel heavy on the skin and but
the only problem with that is it
oxidizes on me and I know it oxidizes on
a lot of people as well that's when it
like those orange mix it with the oils
in your skin your natural oils and it
makes you Orange so that's the only
problem I have a bit but I feel like
sometimes when I wear it and by the time
you put on today by the time you've done
you're done you can see it oh you've
done your highlight and contour it
balances it out a little bit so it's not
too bad so yeah make sure you fix fluid
is a good one and primer I'm not a huge
fan of primers I prefer to use
moisturizers or the Nivea for men poche
bar is really really good as it keeps
you make one all day but doing problem
of it is I know it breaks a lot of
people are like let's do a little bit
I've heard days ago is tell me that it
breaks them out so just be aware of that
anyway how I feeling about YouTube right
now I love it absolutely love it I
always love it I feel like the bigger
I'm getting more hey I'm getting but I
can give a to be quite
honest I just feel like I need to push
myself a little bit more there and be a
bit more consistent because I constantly
do makeup tutorials I think I need to
switch up and do something where you
guys get to know me a bit better our
personality wise that's what I'm going
to sit down and do this
because sometimes when you're filming
makeup tutorials it's hard to get your
personality across so these type of
videos are perfect I need to start doing
more of these really and more fun videos
I want to do this year we're doing will
change videos more collaborations with
other people um and things like that
this year I think what is your favorite
makeup lip to do Browns bronzy skin and
like brown and gold eye makeup
I feel like brown and gold I'm a that's
probably everybody's favorite because it
looks so good on every single eye color
and I don't know anyone that doesn't see
a raw soft brown or a dark brown or a
chocolate brown or a cool tone brown
eyes I don't know anyone don't do it so
Browns are my goatees love them and what
fake time to use and how do you get it
so dark so for a little while for about
two months I was actually using some
beds I don't recommend using them by the
way they are so dangerous for many
reasons and they also age you so don't
even it but what happens with me is when
my skin gets like when I get bad
breakouts which is right like which is
right like it's kind of like once a year
I had a bad breakup when it was changing
from summer to winter and with skin like
it got really cold when the Sun and my
skin was affected by it so I had a bad
break out so some beds for me gets rid
of just helps I don't know what it is I
think it's the vitamin D I have no idea
but it gets rid of my spots so that's
why you summers for a little while which
got me a bit of a tan and then recently
I've just gone back to fake tan again so
I use the love in town in ultra dark and
honestly hands-down the best fake time
ever I also love because that one's from
Australia so it's quite hard to get your
hands on but if you did want to just
spend a little bit extra money I
definitely recommend getting that but
also the San Tropez dark bronzing mousse
is also a really good one
really really good one
what do you do to become so successful
tips to becoming a good YouTube and
start a Norfolk cetera um
it's just I don't even know what to say
like I get this question all the time
loads of people always asking for advice
on how to grow their channel or how to
grow their Instagram and things like
that Instagram at the moment is huge
there's so many people doing the same
thing it's really really difficult to be
to stand out and be unique these days I
feel like because everyone's kind of
doing the same thing which is not a bad
thing but it's just overpopulated
Nellore so anyone that start up trying
to start now is going to be so difficult
when I first started Instagram three
years ago when I started making it more
professional three years ago um it was
still big back then but it was nowhere
near as big as what it is now now it's
like everyone's doing makeup videos
everyone's doing makeup notes everyone
it's so huge now it's so big and it's so
difficult to beat it to be different
with my team at the moment I feel like
Instagram the hardest one to grow in my
opinion really sickly you have to post
once a day when you first start out with
the best thing to use is hashtags
I still use them now everyone still uses
them if you wanna get noticed by big
brands like hashtag Anasazi Beverly
Hills or hashtag benefit or hashtag
house of lashes anything that you're
used in or anything that you've got on
your face in there in your picture make
sure you tag it set you at the company
you tagged the company and you also has
tag that's how I got noticed the first
person I got noticed by was Lilly
ghalichi and she reposted me and then
from there waits around just kind of
blew up a little bit but putting the
work be consistent YouTube is not for
everyone everyone thinks it's ours
amazing job already YouTube as a job but
if you don't if you're not passionate
about it you don't love it it's just
going to feel like another job to you
it's just going to feel like a job so to
me it doesn't feel like a job because I
love it I love creating makeup I love
what I do so to me it doesn't feel like
that but for anybody else who's just
doing it for money reasons or doing it
because they want to have it as a job
but not because they like to get
creative not because they want to create
content you know who's going to end up
hating anyway you won't stick it out
that makes sense it's not for everyone
and also you have to be aware of the
amount
level of abuse that you're going to get
on a daily basis like there are some
horrible nasty people need in it and
know everybody's nice so really really
think about it before you do it but
that's my advice anyway consistency work
hard try and be unique if you can it's
really difficult these days
um yeah next one how do you say so
consistent honestly I don't see it as a
chore a kalapa who would say like just
is doing your makeup every day like I'd
sure like or compose do that for me it's
not I love doing it I love sitting down
and creating makeup looks like to me
it's like just comes natural that makes
sense and I I like she just love sitting
there and just spending hours on my
makeup like I was so much to sit there
and spend two hours alone just doing a
cut crease on eye and eye makeup just
playing around with different colors and
techniques or trying different ways of
doing things trying what I like to do is
well sit down and try it simplify things
so then when it comes to me doing it on
YouTube it makes it easier for other
people if that makes sense because there
are a lot of tricks and easier ways to
being able to do things so I like to do
that as well but it never feels like a
chore to me it always just comes natural
and I think that's why people are you
always say consistent are you always you
always face the makeup looks like you
always it on what because I don't see it
as like oh I've got a place to make I
would say stay consistent I just do it
for some a sense I can't explain it by
thinking I mean and what's your favorite
drugstore foundation my favorite
drugstore foundation used to be the
L'Oreal True Match but I feel like since
they changed the packaging the actual
product isn't the same I don't know if
anybody feels at that but I know you
can't get the old the old one at the old
packaging and I forgot the old product
only in America like in the UK it's like
you can't get it anymore but yes it's
they change the packaging and I fill out
the products changed as well slightly
and it's not then I it's not as good as
it why
how have you become so big it's
incredible I love you so so it to me on
anything right and that big like I still
don't think I am but when people see me
in public in they're like I follow your
YouTube channel I'm just like shocked on
my because I feel like you don't put the
number into people with that make sense
like the amount of subscribers I have I
like to see that as like individual
people I just see that as a number so
when people actually know who I am all
right I just find it really strange like
I went to I was in rugby the other day
which is near Birmingham because my
boyfriend lives there and we went to
like this little shopping bit near his
house I'm using debenhams and someone
come up to me and said are like I
watched a youtube channel right can I
get a picture and I was like oh yeah I
just find it change cuz I don't know I
don't see myself like that so it's nice
to be recognized for what I do that I
really appreciate that I think it's
amazing like being noticed for something
that your good eyes always good
obviously but yeah still crazy to me
here's your favorite YouTube to watch my
favorite YouTube to watch probably I
have a few I love a mind ends in
obsessive her I just I don't know what
it is so I defy her face I just love on
his like washing head put makeup on like
I feel like her under eyes she has no
creases under her eyes like a funny firm
i watch her videos and it just makes me
want to buy everything so that's not
good as well but I love around anything
I also love desi Perkins I think she's
got a really cool personality not really
cool love her um I also like Manny
anyway and Patrick Starr I also watched
them quite a lot as well all the big
ones really is who i watch tell us about
your diet of fitness
you're an amazing show you guys are the
laziest person you will ever meet
like when it comes to exercise like I
don't even know how I ended up like this
because I used to dance eight hours a
day my
Friday so for me to now be this lazy
it's not okay it's not okay
well boyfriend took me to the junior
ballet his slight huge gym and I was
dead after five minutes I might be
joking I was moving in like do I really
have to do this he was like yeah I do
this I'm like right honestly I hate it
III don't know why this year I'm gonna
get back into it and I'm gonna get fit
because I am lazy and I need to sort out
but I honestly diet-wise
I her under so I just think I'm lucky
honestly because I eat so bad like
McDonald's KFC Nando's anything you can
think of I it would time all the time so
I don't even have any tips but I'm gonna
get I'm going to go back to gym up a gym
membership and I never go so I actually
need to start going again
um tips on how to be confident I think
just I kind of shot everyone else out
and I've highly lived my own little
world and people sometimes are you live
in your own well but I'm like I like
living in my own little world like I
just do me I'm so worried about me what
I'm doing I don't worry about no one
else I think that's what's made me
really confident it's just not caring
about anyone but must know that I this
is not caring about what's going on
around me I'm just focusing on what I'm
doing I think that's really helped me as
well like I never used to be confident
at all trust me that I used to be so shy
not really really shy I think just focus
on yourself worry about yourself and
stop trying please everyone else because
the more you try and please everyone
else you're not gonna please everyone
like I'm just going to tell you straight
you're not going to please everyone not
everyone's going to like you and that's
okay but not everyone likes me but I
don't care I don't care if you like me
or not because I don't know you and I'm
too busy trying to do my own thing but
I'm not worried you know what I mean
what's the best thing you've learned
from the entire experience of being a
YouTube makeup icon
I appreciate the hey so if you write
hateful comment I actually really
appreciate it because it's made me a
stronger person it's made me a better
person and I appreciate the love as well
you have no idea how much you might
affect me on a daily basis all the nice
comments that you send me in front that
motivates me so much you have no idea
and I really want to give back to you
guys in so many ways I've got loads of
things in my mind that I'm going to do
I'm not gonna speak about just yet but
honestly the biggest thing I've learned
is to I don't even think it's lessons
learned I think it's just it's made me a
better person it's made me a stronger
person a more confident person all of
those really it's helped me a lot
what did you want to be when you were a
little girl so growing up until the age
of 18 or 19 I want you to be a
professional dancer I also wanted to be
a singer I wanted to be a pop star I
honestly did I really wanted to be a
singer and a dancer singing and dancing
was this my life up until then
unfortunately it didn't work out for me
but I'm glad I gave it a go because if I
didn't then I would have regret it but
it wasn't for me and now I'm here so I
appreciate I thought if I was for a
reason but yeah growing up I want you to
be a dancer and a singer I still like
you wanna be that okay
the industry is difficult I was in a
girl group if anyone followed me back in
the day when I spin a girl band so funny
um but the industry just wasn't for me
but it's cool I'm happy with what I do
not so sort of mine what are your new
year's resolutions so I think one a big
thing I need to do is get more organized
I am the most unorganized person you
whatever me I am so I live in the moment
I'll just wake up so I but when I do in
the day I don't plan things I'm a very
spontaneous person and but sometimes
it's a bit bad because I just yeah I
just need to organize myself but I need
to write things down I need to plan
and makeup look so I'm going to do but
Joe what I feel like the best makeup
looks always turn out when I just sit
down and I film and I don't know what
I'm going to do but I just do it so
that's always the best way but I do
think I do need to get Morgan eyes okay
because my life is just a mess joking
goes for the future where do you see
yourself in five years so my goals for
the future are I want to own a cosmetic
brand I went on my own brand and I just
want to give the UK affordable really
good makeup I feel like it's really
difficult we do have some you know we do
have some things UK that are affordable
I'm really good but mostly we don't have
a lot and I feel like I want to I want
to give everyone what we need it's just
so much missing off the market in the UK
my opinion there's so much missing when
you go into boots and Superdrug
I'll go and look look look around I'm
start even eyelashes you can't buy
really dramatic or nice eyelashes in
store anywhere I just can't find in it
like many things like house of lashes or
like coke eyelashes or Lilly ghalichi
lashes in stores like seriously come on
this is 2017 we need these in boots and
Superdrug
come on because that would save my life
then why I spend or shipping and stuff
is actually a joke and I want to have
five million subscribers hey um I will
see me when I travel the world I want to
get enough money and just see everywhere
go everywhere because it's quite easy
for me because I work I can work
anywhere work for myself so it's easy
for me to just take my stuff and film
wherever I want do not a minute when
will you be buying your first house what
would your house look like a specific
theme so I hopefully I'm going to buy a
house by the end of this year
fingers crossed that's not bad I have
very my taste is very simple I don't
like too much if that make sense I just
want it to be very modern
and simple so I like koalas like news
and Grey's and just really light colors
and just plain I'm very planet I'm a
very plain person and also I'm very
funny but I'm gonna have a sparkly
staircase and my house like it has to
happen have you seen that staircase on
Instagram it's been going by wrong it's
a picture and it's like sparkly stairs I
need to find it it's it's a bomb that's
why I'm gonna have my house my beauty
room is going to just be the tits I'm
gonna have like a sparkly wall I'm gonna
have like a whole room from wardrobe but
I've just got savory ideas you don't
even know like honestly I have so many
ideas but I want to buy my heart buy a
house by the end of I feel like in 2016
was a whole year of party and going out
and meeting new people and I wasted so
much money I can't even explain to you
how much money or waste it it was like a
freemartin this summer and look at my
bank statement I looked at my bank
statement and I felt sick how much money
I've wasted on going out and lights out
most of the time I didn't even have a
good time
I just went out because it was something
to do and it's someone I'm always going
to be out and something I always want to
be out doing things but this year is the
year of saving hard so my house what are
the three main points to starting a
YouTube channel and making it successful
one be yourself don't try out like
somebody else just be used to other
people don't like it them nan cares
but just be yourself
second of all consistency be consistent
don't post once a month or once every
two months because people get bored
people want to see stuff continuously
off and try and think outside the box
try and be different it's really hard
like I said because everyone's doing the
same thing so it's really difficult but
try your best to be different or push
yourself out your comfort zone as well
how much does Instagram and YouTube
changed your life that's actually a
really good one it's opened so many
doors for me so many opportunities I've
met so many people through it it's been
amazing I honestly
sixteen was the best year of my life and
I got noticed by some of the biggest
brands in the industry I recently got
put on the benefit PR list so I went out
of them for at Christmastime for torture
showing for drinks and stuff so that was
amazing I honestly never dreamed I'd be
on the benefit be honest but it's crazy
because when I went for a benefit job on
a benefit counter years ago I got
actually turned down so it's actually
crazy now that I'm on the PLS but and
it's it's just opened so many doors and
so many opportunities I've had clothing
collections with my bandage dress I
would never have had that like I said
I've just collaborate with so many
brands to share and um I'm just really
grateful it's honestly been amazing and
I've met some amazing people for it as
well how did it all start up what's your
inspiration where when did it when it
all began and how you've come from there
to now I can't remember what it was it
inspired me to learn about makeup I
honestly can't remember it was three
years ago not wanna see don't remember
what inspired me and there are a lot of
people on the internet that inspired me
I was obsessed with Lanka yes when I
first was watching YouTube and my
biggest inspiration is um Ricci she has
messaged me on Twitter and Instagram DM
Italy passed out like I'll like I
learned he was childhood select fine
girl because she was talking to me no
more as I never had his but I was
sure I was like no but I love her so
much I think she is just the
baddest bitch and I said if I want to
seal off her and I just love what she
stands for and she's so glam like glam
to the gods so I the most glamorous I've
ever seen in my life and I've seen she's
gorgeous and she has an amazing life so
she's very inspirational to me I really
she really inspires me and she's just
one of the nicest people ever
just from talking to her I think she's
so nice
what's your biggest achievements they
find your career I feel like this year
I've achieved so much so much and one of
my biggest achievements was becoming
self-employed I quit my job in April and
I've been 7 floyd since and it's been
the most amazing thing I never get that
Monday morning feeling I never feel like
I'm working and I always just feel like
I'm living I don't feel like I'm working
and it's just the most amazing feeling I
feel so blessed so blessed you don't
understand and and I've just achieved so
much this year that I had four
collections with my bandage dress I'm on
the anasazi movie who's pianist
I got noticed by benefit I've been
noticed by so many huge brands as well
yeah I feel like I would just achieve so
much this year I just can't wait for
this next year I feel like it's going to
be so good but yeah that is all I'm
going to answer for now because this
video is already half an hour off and
there's like 400 sign questions so I
