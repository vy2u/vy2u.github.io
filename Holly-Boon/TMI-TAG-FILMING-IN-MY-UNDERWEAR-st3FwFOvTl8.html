filming their TMI tag thanks to Rachel
Deary who tagged me to do this video and
so yeah I'm just literally gonna go
through the questions and answer them
which is what you're supposed to do oh
my god I'm so stupid sometimes
okay so the question number one is what
you wear in so missourian is like the
vest top and then I've just literally
got my fluffy dressing-gown like tied
around my waist
there I actually most the time I just
filming like this because you can only
see this part of me like a top and then
just like tracky bottoms or just
literally like my own daughter this is
called the TMI tag guys too much
information so they go too much
information you didn't need to know that
what I told you okay number two ever
being in love yes my home ever had a
terrible breakup no honey I have um how
tall are you
I am 5 foot 4 a lot of people thing will
fight to buy unless you don't I'm quite
small and how much do you weigh I'm
actually sure how much awakes that
aren't really weighing myself I think
I'm about 9 stone farm not sure any
tattoos no any piercings yes I've got my
ears pierced but basically when I was
younger and some of you guys will
remember if you're my age back in like
when I was in like what time he was
she's like year 9 at school maybe
and it was like fashion was where these
really big square heavy earrings and I
used to wear them and like they
stretched my ear hole and it's not
closed up and then when I work earrings
I don't hang out I look like Pat butcher
it's just awful on me so yeah he'll
never wear earrings and favorite show
I'm guessing that's like TV program um
Hollyoaks I live for Hollyoaks Holly oh
this is my life I'll mix you up estimate
whether they really need to like find
out the Lindsay's the Kenan Alex I'm
getting a bit bored I it's been going on

Lindsay's the killer piece anyway if you
watch how to make sure know what I'm
going on about

listen to bands so can't we say no I
don't we have a favorite band and
something you miss Joe what I miss I
miss when you like when you're young guy
and you're at school you want to grow up
quick and stuff I miss it she like faint
school I was worried about money we had
to worry about was what you was gonna
have for lunch I you didn't have to
worry about bills and all that jazz so
yeah if you're at school then embrace
that cuz when you have to get a job
and actually pay bills and stuff it's
like and I mean but yeah ahem
favorite song and I'm not gonna say we
are no work because that's everyone's
favorite song even though they're it's
my favorite song but okay so my favorite
song is Rihanna needed me which is from
her new album how old you I am 21 and 22
in July which means I am a cancer which
answers the next question and yeah
shallots everyone's account sir and
quality you look for in a partner
someone that doesn't take after you
seriously just was to have a laugh and
is like supportive and no negative
people but I like being surrounded by
negative people are not positive people
so yeah I've been my boy for now for
three years coming up three years and
he's literally everything like we get on
so well we just he's just so like
chilled out once over laughs and that's
the type of what I like so yeah um
favorite quote and I already know me
have a favorite quote as such not only
have one sorry
favorite actor and Adam Sandler sounds
I think this is it
favorite color nude orange car key light
pink black yeah loud music or soft loud
where do you go when you're sad my bed I
love my bed I'd actually love my bed my
bed is everything how long does it take
you to shower it depends on the mood I'm
in if I'm in one of those moods where I
just wanna like dance in the shower and
sing and all that jazz like you know I'm
talking about and then it takes me like
20 minutes but if I'm just like having a
shower so just like wash my hair do my
business then ten minutes maybe other
nice I've never taught myself how long
does it take you to get ready in the
morning it depends if I'm doing a full
face of makeup on my hair then an hour
and a half two hours but if I'm itchy
when I go to work because I won't money
she's there Wednesdays um
I literally just put like do my brows
took a bit of concealer under my eyes
and a bit of scar and then I literally
go go to work and I look like I've just
rolled out of bed so I always think I
want to go for it on my lunch breaks and
I'm will be Freetown I'm like if anyone
sees me now they're gonna be like she
does not look like a bit just because I
let you look like I've just started come
back to life but and again ever been in
a physical fight
no no banana fight I don't like fightin
no um turn on a turn on
I think just someone that can make me
laugh like yeah I love people that make
me laugh
turn off arrogance like I love
self-confidence but I hate when people
there's like a fine line I think between
like being really confident and being
arrogant and being arrogant and just
thinking you're better than everybody
else I don't know people like that
no okay
the reason I joined YouTube so the
reason I joined YouTube is because I was
started posting makeup inches and we
Instagram and so many of you but asking
me to show you how I create certain
looks and stuff so that's basically why
I did it and I'm so glad you guys pushed
me to do it because it's like my
favorite thing to do now like I
absolutely love it and yeah it's the
best thank you for pushing me to do it
um fears I'm absolutely terrified of
heights
and I think that's actually the only
thing I'm literally terrified of heights
and last thing that made you cry I don't
really cry that much sometimes I cry for
no reason I know that sounds really
stupid but you guys we know what I mean
like when it's that time of the month
and you cry because you can't fit your
plate in the dishwasher or you cry
because you can't tie your hair up it's
not I mean one of them I'm one of them
