this tutorial because I normally skip
this part it takes me so long to do them
but I've changed what I use and I'm
obsessed so I wanted to share it with
you all so um so I've been using their
benefit precisely my brow pencil and
also I've been using their gimme brow on
top and it's like my favorite thing to
do now so it's a bit this one's a bit
like the brow wears by and it stars if
of your hairs but this one's a lot
creamier and easier to use so I'm just
going to brush my hairs up I kind of
doubt it was like really define so I
just kind of just add her add light
little strokes so it looks like pairs
and sometimes I rub it over my finger
like this so it looks a bit more natural
I still love the brower's but this was
just so much creamier and easier to use
so when I get to the front of my eyebrow
I let you hardly any products I know
just that you do it so naughty
then after I've done that I like to go
over it with the gimme brow by benefit
yeah so I just like to brush through
gently just adds a little bit more color
and it will keep the hair in place as
well okay so now I'm going to just carve
up my eyebrow and I'm going to prime my
I will use an eyeshadow base I'm going
to use concealer so I'm going to
actually use the Maybelline age rewind
continue no this is really good the only
thing I hate about is a sponge like you
guys already know this um I'm going to
do just rip the sponge up about then
just come down like that and it's a lot
easy to use so I'm going to take my
Sigma E 58 brush and carve out my
eyebrow and apply this as an eyeshadow
base also
okay so then I'm just going to take my
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
just apply this to my eyelid just to set
that concealer make sure it isn't free
and also it helps have my eyeshadows but
are a lot easier so today I'm going to
be taking the sweet peach palette by Too
Faced this palette smells unbelievable
or I let you win it you so first of all
I'm just going to take this shade right
here which is called pure way I'm just
going to apply this in the crease and
the outer corner of the eye and the
brush that I'm using is the Sigma e30 a
bra
I'm not going to move too much of this
product straightaway I'm just going to
build up the color because I want this
to be more of just a transition color so
I'm justifying a tiny bit of it so it's
not a dark
so I'm going in with the same color but
this time I'm focusing it more in the
crease and then the outer corner of my
eye and then I'm just blending it up
slightly but not as high as up here
so next I'm going to take this shade
right here which is called somewhat YUM
I'm going to apply that in the crease
and the outer corner of the eye and the
brush amazing is the Sigma II 57 brush I
have a discount code with Sigma which is
just a poly if you want to get any money
off and you brush you're going to get
any I'll link them all in the
description box anyway
I'm going to take my Sigma buff and
blend brush and I'm just going to burn
these two shades together this one is
the e39 brush
so next I'm going to take this shade
right here and I'm going to apply this
to the outer corner of the eye and
halfway in the crease and I'm going to
use the same brush I'll just shoot
and then I'm gonna take my off and blend
brush again and then again blend out the
edges there's nothing on this brush it's
just I'm using it to off the edges out
there's no product on this brush
okay so now that's done I'm going to
take my age rewind concealer again and
I'm going to take my Sigma this is the E
56 lid brush and I'm gonna basically
carve up my lid
just cover my art my lid out to about
half way and then this out of it here
I'm just going to blend that so there's
no it's not harsh spend that in again
taking my box and blend brush by Sigma
I'm going to go for this stage right
here just peachy pink shade and does it
bother overwork justified the conceit
I'm gonna spray my brush I'm using my
firm shader brush yeah so I'm just gonna
spray some of this with fixed fast
because then it will to make the product
a bit more intense my eye so I'm just
going to apply this over the concealer I
just applied
oh my goodness how gorgeous is the shade
so nice it like reflects this really
gorgeous peach I know if you can see it
it's pink but it's like flexing peach so
pretty okay so now I'm going to just
line my lash line I'm going to take the
Sigma gel liner and wicked and also the
Sigma e 17 water line brush and we're
just gonna yeah line my last riser that
my eyelashes bend in a little bit better
okay so Mex just going to apply little
bit of mascara first of all so I'm using
the Loreal task Vic it's going to apply
a little bit of this before I apply my
lashes so for lashes today I'm going to
use my Lily lashes in the style Vegas
these are so dramatic like me I'll if
you love the lash glue that I'm going to
use is by demure lashes w washes unless
you want to no need to get some more
eyelid she loved this eyelash glue it's
the best Irish grip over years and a lot
of people got one about this eyelash
glue right this duo I hang it I don't
know what it is it doesn't keep my
lashes on it just doesn't work for me I
find it very difficult to apply it to
the lashes because you squeeze the
bottles ducts lightly and loads of it
comes out I just I'm just not a fan of
it at all but I've patched it a couple
of times now I thought I'll give another
guy but I don't like it at all
so I apply my lashes with tweezers and
like there's some reason why Anastasio
Beverly Hills ones but I find it so much
easier like if you struggle to put
eyelashes on then try and do it with
Twiiter that's rather than your fingers
it's a lot lot easier so and also you
just want to make sure that the eyelash
glue is a little bit dry before you buy
it to it so I always stick the middle
first and then I'll do this outside
you
I'll just pinch it to make sure it's
right near my left eye as well then I
switch her and set the time and I'll
just adjust good fun
okay so whilst my lashes dry they look
crazy right now their story jamai it but
they just crazy for something on my face
makeup so bear would have got it bad but
um I'm going to then it do my face so
where the is my wine well so for my
prime I'm going to use the Nivea for men
post-show mom
a lot of people say that this gives them
breakouts and it's never actually broke
me out yeah things gross touchwood and I
really like it it keeps my makeup on
order or my foundation today I'm going
to take the Mac Studio Fix fluid um he's
the one that I always go back to I can't
help it I'm just obsessed I'm also going
to mix in with that some of the iconic
London illuminator drops just to make a
little bit more luminous and not slow
matte and then I'm going to apply my
foundation with my Sigma cuz booth flat
kabuki brush SAT this video video
probably sounds like it's sponsored by
bloody Sigma but it's not they just sent
me like a whole new brush set for the
year and I was like Sigma brushes Mac
brushes and also it's the Weaver brushes
are my favorite and I tried the morphe
brushes because everyone was those one
of my homies in there I tried them a
couple years ago now actually maybe a
year ago now um you just see much you
can't receive a whole face oh my head
excitement um yeah I tried the more
people she's about a year ago and
sibelius I don't every just had a bad
experience or what but I ordered a few
brushes from them and I found them
really spiky like they really hurt like
when I use the eye brushes like the
brushes were so spiking I just I just
couldn't use it hurt like I said I don't
know if I just had a bad experience so
what I want you to try they're more
luxury brushes because I know they do
you like and more luxury ones so I think
I'm going to try those next and just let
you guys know what ink but it kind of
put me off using them after that happen
okay so for all consider how this is my
new favorite concealer are you guys
going to block for God's sake because I
change all the time
see I'm going to mix two concealers the
first one is what one of my favorites
that you already know and that's
Maybelline age wine so I'm going to mix
this one with my this is a new one I'm
obsessed with it's called the Double
Wear stay in place flawless wear
concealer by Estee Lauder this is one of
my absolute favorites now I purchased it
a couple of weeks ago I've been using it
every single day nearly and I love it so
I'm going to mix this in with my age
rewind the age rewind is a bit more for
corporate I like to bring my concealer
right against my nose here because it
makes your nose a pistola or thinner
when you like add the contour and stuff
so I like to remarket either up to there
if you've already got a thin nose and
you don't need to see that I get quite a
little redness around my nose as well so
depending like on hormones sometimes I
do sometimes I don't so I personally
like to highlight my chin area sometimes
I do sometimes I died mostly I do it
just because my chin sticks out anyways
so but what I've got quite from the
prominent chin so I don't like to to
accentuate that so I'm just going to
take my Beauty Blender this is a nude I
don't know why what I'm new to Butte
vendek's I just feel like the looks day
like on the side I'm look it's nude to
not me and but I just sprayed this with
some fix+ it's a little bit down what's
scratching my hand because I I have to
breathe it itch on my hand the other day
like don't if anybody's ever had that
like where it is like under your skin
like it was itching underneath my skin
and I just kept scratching scratching
scratching in it and then I'll just give
myself an actual scratch on my hair a
lot just scrape the skin off I was
itching it that hard take a layer of
skin off I like a really bright under
eye light each to their own but I like
my under eye really bright so before
anybody says anything your under eyes
way too bright I like it it's crazy how
like I used to lips you just wear
foundation the little bag of itches and
I'm like oh my god no
Pfitzner then what they should look so
flat okay so I don't really want to bake
today as such I thought this continues
really good isn't crease anyway I didn't
increase too much anyway so I just going
to dust some powder we want dust because
I'm going to press it into the skin but
I don't want to apply too much basically
so I'm just going to use this Sigma
tapered kabuki brush and here's the f-89
this estee lauder double I can see that
it's so good for not creasing and I find
that hard to find that's why I've been
loving it like I'm what you try it the
other day like I didn't even know you'd
like the Double Wear concealer I've used
a foundation before but I'm even no need
to consider so when I saw it I was like
ah honey straight up I'm glad I did
because I really liked that so I'm going
to go in with my Mac give me son next
and I'm just going to use this soft
angled contour brush by Sigma again and
this is the F 23 you can literally just
get all Sigma brushes in your life and
be complete I feel like fill up my
life's complete now I have all the
brushes
 I just dropped my gimme song after
that I'm then going to contour and as
always as I use this full design I'm
gonna use the makeup geek half-hearted
power this one here and to contour it's
such a good cool tiny shade you just
look so good it's easy to blend it's
these pans are very easy to run dry so
good get rid of this from Christmas
taking the trucks where contour that
chin come on boy lucky oh I think
like a bit too much okay so you for
blush because obviously honey blush I'm
going to take the Too Faced this is from
the peach collection this two-phased
peachy blush and it's just like a
shimmery bit shimmery pink and also I'm
going to focus it on the just part of my
face here rather than on the apples just
prefer the way it looks I saw so I'm
just going to finish with my eyes before
I do highlight and stuff of that and the
brush on reason is the Sigma e30 brush
so this is the shade summer young so I'm
just going to apply this of all and then
a mirror I was charmed I'm sure
I'm just going to kind of keep this to
the outer part of my eye I'm not going
to bring it all the way and just about
half way
okay and I'm just going to apply some of
these Sigma gel liner into my bottom
waterline I wants to be a bit more smoky
akin so I'm gonna apply this in the lash
line first of all again I'm not going to
bring it all the way in I've stopped
coming back three-quarters of the way if
I bring it too far in it makes my eyes
accrete close together I'm just going to
run it slightly underneath that line and
then we take my smudge brush which is
the e21 and smudge out that looks a bit
more smoky because my lashes i've got on
are so dramatic and I just like to
balance it out with more of a dramatic
lower lash line otherwise I just think
it looks a bit overpowering so M if you
ever feel like your eyelashes a bit too
dramatic
um just smoke out your lower lash line
honestly
so for highlight today I'm going to take
my iconic London illuminated drops these
are dope like I mixes in my foundation
or I just wear them on their own and
they're so bright so nice that if you
really want that dewy looking glow
rather than a powdery go this is like
these are life I can't even deal and
then taking my beauty blender to blend
that up they're just so gorgeous these
jaw drops like they just work amazing
and they work so well it's so easy for
your highlights end up looking like
really powdery when you use that powder
so these are Luminator drops on Italy
bar Phillips I'm going to use the Amory
Z new liquid lipstick in shade 88
because this stuff this color is life
and this lip this equip stick is so
smooth and nice like it doesn't go bitty
it's really creamy really nice like you
don't feel like you have it on your lips
if I make sense like a lot of other
liquid lipsticks I feel I can feel it on
my lips where's this I was really
shocked the other day because I worked
the best time and then like even off
like two three four hours it was still
the same and I was like oh my god like
so nice another so I was going to quit
using my hair on here but my battery my
camera is about to die
so that is the finished makeup lip I
