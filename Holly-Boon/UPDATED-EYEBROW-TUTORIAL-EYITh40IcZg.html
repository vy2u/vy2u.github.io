with the tutorial so I'm using the
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow pomade
in ash brown and this is a angled brush
from revlon and i'm just going to start
by anjali in my eyebrow
see then I'm just going to create a line
at the top I'm just going to stop where
my arches and then I'm just going to
start filling it in so I've been using
the dip brow pomade now for just over a
year and I just love it because I really
love the colors as well and because my
hair's ashy I have like blue-black hair
I don't like to use warm tone Browns so
this being an ass Brown is like the
perfect shade for me I also do like the
Anastasia brow Wiz as well if you're
going from all the natural look but I do
tend to use this more say then I'm just
going to make sure the two lines meet
and so from the arch to the end of my
eyebrow and then again just start
filling that in
if you guys would like to see a video on
how to create more of a natural eyebrow
please let me know and I will do that
for you and but basically just keep
filling it in and said I'm happy with it
and then with just the excesses on the
brush I'm not going to get any more
product on the brush I just start
brushing the hairs at the start of my
eyebrow because I don't like it to be
too harsh at the star
so yeah as a start of my eyebrow I don't
tend to go too crazy I just like to
brush through the hairs and just to kind
of fill in any like gaps or anything
like that but yeah
so now I'm just using this brush by fear
space which is the f20 concealer brush
and I'm using the mac studio finish
concealer in NC 20 and I'm just going to
underline my eyebrow just to make it
look more need
so yeah that's basically how I fill in
my eyebrows I hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial please let me know what you
want to see next and I'll see you again
next time
you
