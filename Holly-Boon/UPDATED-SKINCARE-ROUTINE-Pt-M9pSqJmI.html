film an update skincare routine about a
month ago I decided to change skincare
products and I've been really really
impressed and by these products I've
been using them every single day so I
thought I would basically share this
with you so yeah let's just get tired
and I'm not going to ramble on so I've
got a bottle of water here flannel and
all my skincare products and I'm just
going to show you what I do ideas every
night and every morning first of all the
reason why I just talk to you quickly
about my vanity planet Sparkie because I
use this every single night and with a
cleanse balm to get rid of my makeup
basically so it's basically a device
like this and you have got to to the
speeds and I put my cleansing balm on
this end and then I use it to remove my
makeup and then I have another head that
I use with a scrub that I have as an
exfoliator and I use that one kind of
right two three times a week but this
heads I've got on now i uses every
single night to remove my makeup so yeah
and with vanity planet you can use my
link in the description box and you get
70% off and I've been working with this
brand for about 5-6 months now
I'm obsessed absolutely love it so that
link is in the description box if you
want to get it so the original price is
125 dollars and with my link in the
description box you get it 38 dollars
which is obviously so good also this be
a really good Christmas present I feel
like even if you don't wanna get it for
yourself and just it's like a cute it
was bar kit so it's really good
Christmas present as well so I've been
using the LMS pro-collagen cleansing
balm and I absolutely love it it's
pretty much the same as the penny take
the day off farm but this one just had a
better smell it's a bit more lemonade
I'm literally completely run out nearly
I've seen another one but I absolutely
love it I just prefer I just prefer the
smell of this one that's literally the
only difference between the toes I
prefer the smell but yeah so I normally
put some of this on my vanity panic
cleanser and then I let you just do this
if I was going to wipe this side of my
face or a corrective scott funnel just
wet my funnel
my eye makeup is always a little bit
tougher to get on get off so I always
take a little bit of this bar on my
finger and just gently rub it over my
lashes and my eyes and stuff why does I
do both eyes at same time now part C
Vonda in what is here actually I'll show
you actually I'm gonna explain yet today
because I have actually expected in a
while so I'm just going to exfoliate my
face today so I can show you the other
heads I use with this machine so I use
this one which is a really flat it's
like a little bit more rough and it's
not as soft as the other ones I don't
know how to explain this but you get
three heads in this set as well so yeah
I use this one and then I have the LMS
skin buff I am not supposed to buy LMS
by the way you guys are putting anything
around because I'm using venomous
products apart from a serum but I'm
actually not I went out and bought these
because I always want you to try LMS I
used to use templates by light you guys
know it and I just always want to try to
mess up today's people use it so I just
thought I bought like a cleanse I did
what I did on I thought well I'm going
to buy Penzer and tiny this LMS and
what's gonna buy them all Belarus do you
not I mean hope I'll be ICD like that so
yeah I'm not sponsored by animus and I'm
not visiting this suffer for you or
anything so just so you guys know um so
yeah I'm going to use the skin buff I
use this once or twice a week this is
like a really deep cleanse and exfoliate
our CI so I'm going to use this so I
just put it on my fingers wet my hands
I'll rub it in my hands first and then
just apply it over my face this is quite
rough on the skin so if you've got
reasons to skin uh probably won't
recommend using this so then I'm going
to take my planet you've had it a
machinee thingy I don't know how to
explain this spark it that's what they
called it you know um and then I'm just
gonna rise my face
so funny because my boyfriend's always
like can you use that stuff on me like
oh come on why not barf and he's like he
was asked me if I'll cleanse and do his
skin Isis in the bath because he loves
her these products are really really
good they are expensive don't get me
wrong if what you can find cheaper ones
are just as good please let me know okay
next thing this is something that again
I'm not going to use this right now
bombs we talked about it this is a gel
mask it's a dynamic resurfacing mask
it's really really nice if you're in a
hot bath you put it on your face a 10-15
minutes and wash it off because it's
really cool in like it's really strange
like your face goes really cold and it
feels really refreshing really nice so
yeah I don't really use this too much
probably once or twice a week I'm going
to spray my face with the LMS I'm sorry
this is all well miss stuff but I have
really did like if I use one LMS thing I
have to use everything and a Miss in my
skincare it's pretty good
okay so I'm going to use this even
apricot toner and all I do this is
literally spray over my face and then I
just like tap my face that you just
press it into my skin
it smells on balloon will about then
after that this is for day and night I
have to doing things so when it comes to
daytime I use the LMS biotechs skin
energizing day cream this has got any
agent in it which is really good as well
I feel like a lot of people don't
realize when it comes down to an aging
products you're actually supposed to use
them when you're younger prevent aging
hence why it's called anti age yeah a
lot of people seem to think that you
just use them when you're old and it
gets rid of wrinkles that's not the case
they are anti aging so using when you're
younger and it prevents you look at
ongoing older that make sense other than
that made sense but yeah I use this in
the daytime and but because it's the
evening right now I'm going to use my
serum and this is the Estee Lauder
advanced Night Repair Serum not other
miss product but yeah I love this ilex
you just this is a serum and it should
just put up a couple of bumps on this in
my hands and then rub it all over my
face it's a really good oil and if
you've got dry skin has to be really
good for you but then again I'm oily and
this is still really good I find
especially this time of year like when
it's like getting the web is getting
cold and stuff like my skin tends to get
more dry so I find this theorem works
really well for me just to keep my skin
a good balance
um yeah of that so that is what I do
guys that is literally it I used to use
eye cream don't use an eye cream anymore
I just tend to put moisturizer on my
eyes and when it comes out during the
day and stuff but that is my full
skincare routine I tend to I do this
every single night in every single
morning and with the money you can its
black here and the cleanser etc etc it's
just the masks that I don't do all the
time because you don't really see a face
mask all the time obviously it depends
on the person but I don't do it every
night um but yeah like I said I'll link
that in the description box in case you
want to get this down from $125 238
which is obviously amazing and yeah so I
think that in case you want to get that
I'll also link all these pricing because
you want to get any of these as well
and if you have any questions tweet
Meg's twitter is the best place for me
to answer questions oh yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video make sure you
give it a thumbs up if you did cuz that
really helps me out
thank you and I will see you again next
