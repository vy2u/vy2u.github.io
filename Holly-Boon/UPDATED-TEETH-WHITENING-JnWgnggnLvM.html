would film and update your teeth
whitening video because those of you
always ask me what I use I know I do
have a teeth whitening video on my
channel already but I don't actually use
that anymore
I've changed what I used so I thought I
would just update you guys so yeah so
did used to use the diamond whites home
kit and I did really really liked that I
did gone really well with it but I'm
always looking to try new things and try
different products and see what I
think's better or seen if there's
anything better out there so I decided
to change and so I used to use these and
it's the crest whitening strips so I
used to use this all the time I've been
wanting in my team since I was about 16
which is so bad I don't recommend doing
that because I'm now I have like
severely sensitive teeth so I have to be
really careful what I use now so yeah so
I used to use these years ago and then I
couldn't find them in the UK for a while
but now I found them in the UK again I
repurchase them so this video is not
sponsored at all I've not been paid to
say these are good I am just telling you
these than what I use because I have
used these I guess use these years ago
and I've started using them again so
yeah I haven't actually got before and
after photo which is kind of annoying
because the reason why i whiten my teeth
is kind of just to keep it topped up
rather than go from like stained teeth
to white teeth because I've always
wanted to my team so I don't actually
have a picture of what they don't like
before I even started writing in them so
yeah I basically just use the whitening
strips to top out my white teeth
basically and so I'll show you what they
look like rolling the website below cos
I did get these from the UK and I can't
remember the website the top of my head
but I will link it below in case you
from the UK you want to get these and so
this is what you get these are the this
is like one session so it's like a top
stroke on a bottom strip for your teeth
and there's like I don't know how many
you get in here actually I think I
ordered 28 28 strips this is 14 sessions
in here to get 14 of these and so yeah
this is basically what looks like but if
it wasn't if T's in the higher you
recommend getting these because I might
Eve
ridiculously sensitive I lightly
anything cold ice cream cold drinks and
even I thought my teeth hurt and just
because I I was stupid and started
whining with you from such a young age
and I let you used to do it as well like
all the time but I'd whiten my teeth but
two or three times a week which is
obviously not good at all
I just have an obsession with white safe
I don't know this just me so this is
what you get so this is the top strip
into the bottom strip
it's the wages you just pull this off
pull this up at this and then you want
to stick it to your teeth and then fold
it under I'm just going to show you see
yeah yeah thick it like that and then
just fold it under and you can't drink
anything while you're doing this so make
sure you're not thirsty good I need to
turn sleep these on for about half an
hour to an hour depending on what they
like and this is the bottom one so that
little bit there is going to be the vide
fold over sorry so I'm going to stick it
like that
so basically this is what it looks like
and then I just get my name I'll let you
don't push it in the creases just to
make sure that it's all covered I brush
my teeth before I put these on and I
will so brush my teeth after I've taken
them off as well because when you take
them off you still like sticky so now
brush my teeth again so that's over half
an hour because I didn't feel like I
needed to leave it on for an hour
because my teeth already really white
and that is actually what I do I'm sorry
that I don't have before-and-afters like
because like I said I've already got
really white teeth and I just use it to
top it off and make sure that it's so
white and but yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video anyway and please
give it a thumbs up if you did and make
sure to subscribe if you haven't already
but yeah hope you guys enjoyed it and I
will see you again next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
