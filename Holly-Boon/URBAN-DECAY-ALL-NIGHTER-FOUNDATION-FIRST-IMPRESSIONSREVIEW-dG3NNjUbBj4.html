doing a review on the Urban Decay all
nighter foundation laser people have
advised me to try this it's very full
coverage very matte and lasts all day
and all night apparently and so it's
waterproof a long way and it's oil free
so if you want drier skin you might want
to add like drops of oil into this
foundation because obviously it's going
to cling to your dry patches so yeah I'm
going to try it out anyway I've got the
shade 5 I did get a light shade because
loads of people told me that it oxidizes
so I figured I'd get a lighter shade but
I'm not sure if this is actually too
light for me but we'll see anyway so the
box says the ultimate foundation for a
flawless looking complexion is
waterproof formula provides complete
coverage that lasts all day or all night
with a modern matte finish that never
looks overdone so we loaded this full
coverage foundation with such an insane
amount of pigment that a little goes a
long way and there's no need to build
your coverage or apply multiple layers
light diffusing pigments blur floors for
beautifully perfected skin while
high-tech ingredients mattify tan absorb
oil to reduce the appearance of shine ok
so my skin is combination I'm very oily
in the t-zone sometimes a little bit
oily sometimes really oily it just
depends and the rest of my face tends to
be dry to normal so today the rest of
this part my face is quite normal and
the to zone is a little bit early today
so first of all to prime I'm going to
take the Nivea for men post shave balm
and I've heard that you need to be very
hydrated when you apply this foundation
so if you are a little bit on the dry
side then use a moisturizer use a lot of
moisturizer before you apply this
foundation I've known Tony sure how to
apply it
Buchan under a brush but I'm going to
try a brush a thing ok so the brush that
I'm going to use is the round kabuki
brush by Sigma this is the f82 brush and
so yeah let's try this out and see how
good is so the shade that I got is
definitely way too light for me but
I heard it oxidizes so it will get
darker hopefully this shade is so light
I can't even okay so it does feel quite
Wow that's not it oxidized already
surely Wow okay can you see that as soon
as I'm blending it out it's getting
darker and this brush look how is
oxidizing the brush it's gone orange
come read Ark this is a fresh clean
brush as well there's no other product
on this brush wow that's crazy
did you see that oh my god what the hell
like I've known foundation C oxidize
quickly but damn that was fast
okay so I like the coverage so far I
think it's nice very full coverage
definitely ok quite like the finish the
moment and but look at the color when I
apply it and look what it's turned into
so you need to get light shade oxidizes
so quickly oh my goodness that's
actually crazy I've never known a
foundation to oxidize that fast okay so
I'm just going to buff this in I'm not
sure if that's okay that's pretty not we
supposed to do shits gonna bit flaky
okay do you think you're supposed to
buff this into your skin
because it goes a bit flaky I honestly
can't go over this I'm gonna do it again
right ply it and it's this color right
and then white light ten seconds
blend it in and you've got a whole
different color foundation I can't go
over it
what the hell okay so say for I'm not
really loving it to be honest I don't
like how oxidizes so fast it feels so
matte as well so if you've got dry skin
then I really wouldn't recommend trying
this because it's so mad it goes and
flaky wants it's too
ride I'm going to wait - never played
like conceder and stuff - give it a
proper review but at the moment I'm not
not that into it to be honest I mean
I've got put off straight away when I
saw how much oxidized obviously I wanted
to because it's too light anyway but
that's actually crazy because if you buy
the right shade and then you get home
and you apply this foundation and it's
so much darker you're going to be like
what the hell the only good thing it
doesn't feel thick it doesn't sit feel
like it's really heavy on the skin or
anything so once it's dry if you go over
it with a brush it then starts going all
flaky which is so strange see I'm just
going to see how it looks now
and when I finish up my face and see
what it looks like once I've done I can
see it and everything because sometimes
foundations and concealers can be quite
hard to blend so I'm going to see how
this works my concealer and stuff we say
for concealer I'm actually going to use
the double white stay in place flawless
concealer in light medium then I'm just
going to apply some of the age rewind I
can see that by Maybelline in shade
light mine's a mess because I took the
sponge off the top but it works so much
better it's way more hygienic - part of
a brush I obviously can't go over how
fast that oxidize is I don't buy your
shade like in it by like a shade to
light or maybe two shades - right I
thought that was two shades too light
for me and now it's like getting darker
as well like it's almost the wrong shade
like it's almost too dark now I'm just
going to take my tape it could be Kabuki
brush the f-86 by Sigma and I'm just
going to use this to just buff in that
concealer
the foundation feels really really mad
but my face was dry as hell so I feel
like I don't even need to set my face
I'll just set my under eye stuff
okay if you're really oily I thought
this would work so well for you if
you're really oily and you want a full
coverage foundation this won't be
perfect and so what I would do if you
are really dry and you bought the
foundation and you're like oh my girl is
such a waste I want to use it and I use
the cover FX these are custom infusion
drops and their radiance drops you can
just apply a couple of these drops into
your foundation and it will just change
the consistency of it it will just
change it to a bit more watery not so
maybe not so thick and it won't be as
dry on your skin if you just apply some
drops and also just use loads of
moisturizer before you apply the
foundation so I'm just going to set the
areas that I applied concealer and I'm
just going to set my Laura Mercier
translucent powder we're going to take
that same brush that I used to buff up
my concealer because this brush works
pretty well with powder as well I don't
really necessarily want to bake I'm just
going to apply like a little bit of
powder just to set it I don't want to
bake as such because I'm my face already
feels like crazy matte so I'm just going
to finish off the rest of my face
obviously so the concealers bended in
nicely it's worked well with the
foundation I'm just gonna apply some Mac
give me son this is my favorite bronzer
I know I use it all the time I need to
switch it up but I just calm I'm stuck
on it it's like my favorite we're gonna
get darker throughout the day star I'm
not feeling like a harsh contour today
so I'm just going to bronze and leave it
at that and then I'm just going to
highlight so I'm just going to take my
iconic London illuminator drops these
are like my Holy Grail you already know
you already know the drill so this want
to see how these work in regards this
foundation because this finish is so
Matt sometimes it can make your
illuminator drops or whatever lumen it
using its liquid it can make it look a
bit patchy and it won't sit right so I'm
just going to see what this looks like
with this foundation basically and you
can use code Holly b10
you want to get these drops and I think
you get like ten flames enough I'm not
sure about these are so worth it so I'm
just going to apply this up I normally
would I'd like to fly a little bit above
my eyebrow that's a bit of glow there I
look crazy right now
and then I'm just going to blend that in
with my finger sometimes I use my Beauty
Blender sometimes I use my finger if you
want that really glowy skin without
looking powdery than these illuminator
drops a perfect because they just look
like small like skin which is good
I prefer Oh anyway I personally like to
be highlighted above my eyebrow some
people don't I personally like it
because when I've got nothing on my face
and I send the day light I get a natural
glow here in this area so I like to just
enhance type of makeup as well because I
like the way it looks
so my overall thought on this foundation
is I don't know I honestly don't know
I'm going to try it again but the finish
is really nice I think it looks really
nice once I've done everything it feels
very very much very very dry in my
opinion and it oxidizes like crazy you
guys you've even witnessed it I can't go
over it this is a shade 5 which was a
lot lighter than my actual skin and now
is pretty much a perfect color or maybe
a little bit too dark to be honest so
honestly I think try out for yourself if
you're very oily this is going to be
perfect for you and because it really
helps to keep your foundation on all
night like it says if you're really oily
because I know when you're really oily
it's hard to find foundations that will
last all night but this will definitely
work because it's oil free and very
matte so if you've got oily skin then
this definitely recommend trying it and
if you are dry and you've practiced it
already and you really want to use it
and then I would add some radiance drops
or just apply loads of moisturizer
before you apply it and see how that
works but let me
know how you guys go of it if you like
it if you have any tips oh me to try it
with different ways different techniques
and let me know it might be different if
I apply it with a Beauty Blender I'm not
sure so I'm going to give it a couple
more guys and I will let you know how I
get on with it I hope you guys enjoyed
