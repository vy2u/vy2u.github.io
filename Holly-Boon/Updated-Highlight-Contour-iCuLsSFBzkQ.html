is highlight and contour video because I
have changed the way I do it and this is
more sort of a subtle way not so crazy
saying yeah and I just figured I'd
quickly let you know why didn't post a
video last week because I kind of need
your help and so basically I bought the
Canon 70d camera and I was in love it is
absolutely in front of all it was
amazing but I couldn't actually send
videos from the cameras from my phone
and because I don't me edit online maybe
on my phone I have a Mac or anything
like that
and you can wipe my pictures but you
can't wipe out video which is really
annoying so I was stressing out and I
quickly want to return there and then I
went to a camera shop and he told me to
get this Olympus om-d something climbing
camera and this is what I'm using now
I'm not a huge fan when I'm talking to
you now it sounds really rusty it sounds
really rubbish and all my focus isn't
great and it's also only 16 megapixels
so it's actually worse and they come as
I have before I don't know if this viola
news has anything to do with what the
settings are on I've had a look sorry
and I can't find how to sort it out
but yeah so one thing I'm gonna do is
gonna go back get the can of them today
and get a MacBook Air before you guys
love any really really four cameras
please please please let me know I
really really need your help so yeah I
just don't get that no quickly but yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this video make
sure you give it a thumbs up if you
enjoy it and I'm sorry about the quality
it's not as good as before but I will
get it saw it so I decided to dye my
hair this morning and managed to get
hair dye everywhere say yeah do excuse
that and but for primer I'm using the
Nivea for men post shave balm I heard
nikkietutorials talk about this and I
was dying to try it and I am actually
obsessed of it now I pretty much use
this all the time for prime it's really
really good and I would recommend it to
anyone
so for foundation I'm using the Mac
Studio Fix fluid in NC 35 and I'm using
the zoeva buffing brush I would highly
recommend using a buffing brush when
using foundation just
because it minimizes pause and obviously
you boffin it into your skin rather than
just layering it on top so it always
gives a better finish so I definitely
would recommend getting a buffing brush
so now using a concealer brush I'm going
in with the Becca under-eye brightening
corrector just to correct any dark
circles and then I'm just going to blend
that in with my Beauty Blender
so now to brighten up the will of my
face and to highlight I'm using the
Maybelline fit me concealer and I'm
using this under my eyes down the bridge
of my nose a little bit on my forehead
and my Cupid's bow and then I'm just
gonna blend that out with my Beauty
Blender I am a huge huge fan of this
concealer it's a lot like the NARS
radiant concealer so if you use that one
I would highly recommend trying this
it's a lot lot cheaper and the
consistency of the product is actually a
lot better than the NARS one so yeah
I know just to set that concealer in
place I'm just using my Beauty Blender
and the Mac setting powder now I'm using
this fluffy angled brush and I'm using
the shade cinnamon from the Anastasia
Beverly Hills powder contour kit I'm
just going to use this to obviously
contour and I just want to accentuate my
jaw line my cheekbone and then I just
want to shade my forehead because it is
quite big as they yeah
now for highlight i'm using the laura
geller
baked illuminator in ballerina this is
such a nice highlighter i'm actually
obsessed of it at the moment and I'm
using the lux highlight brush Weiser
Weaver so I just finished off my eye
makeup and now just to finish the look
off I'm using the lip line cosmetics and
Ruthie collection and this is shade
breezy it's a matte liquid lipstick it
looks really really nice with this look
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I will see you again next time make
sure you give it a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and let me know what you want
to see next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
