makeup look how our makeup gonna go on
holiday vacation whatever you want to
call it and because I don't actually
wear full face of makeup loom in the Sun
just because I feel like it kind of
melts off it feels come here
I don't like the way it feels on my skin
when I'm in the Sun and I'm sweating and
all that stuff so this is basically the
makeup routine that I do when I've gone
for a day in the daytime some other ways
and wet anything on my face but this is
like basically what I do so I thought
I'd share and so if you're like snaps or
holiday but you don't know where loads
of makeup in the daytime then this is
for you
also if you're in the UK or anywhere in
the world and you just don't want to
know much makeup but you still run it
snatch them this tutorial is for you as
well so the first thing I want to talk
about is tending my eyebrows because
when I go on holiday I always keep my
eyebrows before I go to finish I pin my
eyebrows
once every six to two weeks and the way
of Allah they make sure that they're
properly done and then I don't have to
worry about them so I read on my eyebrow
to my Arafa day talking about this rub
them a button obviously they just a yes
then for the rest of the vacation and my
eyebrows are fine they're just there
they're done we're not too worried about
it
so the eyebrows size that I like to use
recently I've changed I've been using
this combination and it ought to see
just works a lot like better I think
anyway I just think it lasts longer and
my eyebrows and it dies them a lot
quicker so I believe unless it's
actually an eyelash and eyebrows in this
is in the shade black one and this is by
professional beauty systems I got this
from my local stylist or I don't even
get this online but if you can I will
link it below so you guys can find it
and you need to get a developer and this
is the developer that I use this and
again from professional Beauty systems
this is 3 percent eyelash tint developer
and it comes in little bottle up there
so you just need that little squeeze of
this and then I have a couple of drops
of this and mix it together and then
apply to your eyebrows I leave on for
about 10 to 15 minutes because I know
you're only supposed to be going for a
few minutes but I don't relax
anything so I leave mine on for about 10
to 15 minutes and then my rather done so
yeah that's what I've done today I've
just done my I read like that so that
they're all done and they'll have to
worry about the next thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to apply some of the Mac
strobe cream this is in the shade pink
light those of you were asking me what's
the difference between this one and the
original one to be honest this one's
very self-reflective pink in it but
honestly I don't really see it that much
so I don't think there's a huge drastic
difference between the two and see I'm
just going to apply some of this now I'm
going to apply it to kind of like the
high points of my face and where I want
to look super glowy I'm going to avoid
my T's eyes obvious reasons because I
aren't really so I don't really want to
apply too much of this in that area yeah
I'm just gonna let my cheekbones and
kind of up the size of my forehead to
apply this if I sound a bit farmed up I
think I've got hay fever or I've got a
cold or something other than that I'm
going to kind of spot conceal so I'm
just going to conceal areas where I have
a little bit of redness around sides of
my nose and I'm going to put a tiny bit
under my eyes just because I've got tiny
bit of dark circles and then I'm just
going to spot conceal where I feel like
I need it so I've got a little red dot
there that needs to be concealed so I'm
going to put a little bit under my eyes
and then right sides of my nose where
I've got redness and then yeah just
start it where I feel like I need it and
I'm just going to press this into my
skin my finger
the concealer I use by the way is a NARS
radiant creamy in the shade ginger you
don't want to use a concealer that's too
bright for this because you just you
just want to cover up any dark circles
and just blemishes
since that mean that makes me look way
more awake like I look way more alive
next I really want to try this products
one steel is the awkward glow perfecting
bronzer and I realize right now I've not
actually tried this before so I'm a bit
scared but excited I'm going to apply
this using my duo fiber brush from Sigma
and I just apply a little bit of this to
the skin like this okay so there's
moisturizing on the skin there's no ice
it's definitely very glowy sister and
liquid bronzer
okay so I like that it's giving me that
nice bronzy glowy skin I really like
that my skin ought to be still it's like
skin and put foundation onto my skin you
can still see it but I like the way it
looks just for color like daytime like I
said in the Sun this foundation for me
and in the Sun it's just a bit too much
yeah I really like that so next I'm
going to use my eye clinic on an
illuminator drops in the shade original
I'm just going to put some of these on
the back of my hand and the minute eyes
of my authority band are from Sigma I'm
just going to does my render in the drop
and then I'm going to apply this to my
cheekbones and then above my brown
I think much love my brows it's already
given me this go here anyway okay I'm
just going to brush through my eyebrow
hair using the necks control freak
eyebrow gel I realized product and just
that my eyebrow head stay in place but
like I said I haven't got any product in
my brows I've just tended them and
that's why did it like this Odin loved
it she just dyed them do that so that
they stay and then I'm going to apply
some mascara I'm going to use the
Maybelline big shot just a little bit
Mascaro just a my eyelashes look a bit
darker and I'm just going to put some
lip gloss and I'm going to use the NYX
butter gloss in the shade mother line
and then I'm just going to spray some of
the mac fix+
just to make myself look a little bit
more aware even I look very dewy and
very wet anyway okay so I am going to
apply some of the illuminator drops on
my body because I always do this when my
skin is super glowy I just feel like in
the sunlight you have to kind of match
if you've got a really glowy face you
need to everybody as well you're just
losing so I'm going to take my duo fiber
brush again from Sigma
I'm just going to apply some of these my
collarbones
and almost okay so that is my minimum
makeup tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed
it this is something like I said that I
were on vacation
in the daytime it just feels nice on the
skin not too much makeup I don't come
too much makeup on in the heat that's
just my personal preference and I still
like to have a little bit on again I
will link all the products down in
description box I will try and find the
eyebrows I and the developer for you
guys as well so you guys can get that
it's a really good eyebrows dye and but
this is perfect as well for wearing
sunglasses because I don't know if you
guys I've ever notice where you have
eyelashes on and you try and wear either
sunglasses you can't blink because your
eyelashes get stuck on your sunglasses
so I tend to just put this on my skin
and then when some wear my sunglasses
like this and it's a little good you
know it's good to go
I'm really impressed with this Stila
apps or below perspective bronzer the
first time I've tried it and I just
prefer the way looks from the skin to
powders then only wear powder bronzer
but I actually prefer the look of this
so I'm really impressed that that's
going to be one one your holiday
vacation favorites to take with me so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
