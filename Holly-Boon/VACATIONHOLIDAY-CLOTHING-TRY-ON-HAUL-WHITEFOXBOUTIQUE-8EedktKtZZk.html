would make this video this video is
sponsored by white box boutique but that
is it see all the clothes that I used on
my holiday a worn holiday all the
bikinis the shorts the javanese places
everything that I worn holiday the
dresses was all from white box boutique
so I'm super excited to making this
video for you all please be sure to get
a thumbs up please subscribe as we know
let's crack on okay so the first things
I got was a pink : set I do this is the
exact same one but this one's a little
more of a nude your camel color which is
also really nice I find is really good
for like when you get the airplane and
go somewhere hot and use want to throw
something on Co when I'm on the airplane
I'm just about to get off man in a hot
country hour wear something that is
comfy but you're not going to be roasted
okay so the second thing I've got is
this little placing something for the
wrong part from America or Australia but
we would have placed it over here
it's riku I love the bright yellow and
this colors metallics amazing and it's
just perfect for holiday I think I love
the detail on the front I like the
little bar at the France I like that
it's off the shoulder I think it's
really sexy right off the shoulder and
this would agree Nantucket or across
from dead
I was pretty parrot with some wedges or
just some like I don't know strappy
heels or something but I absolutely love
that okay so the next thing I got was
it's kind of like white freetype it's a
romper again Lacey
it's really cute I like the frozen it I
like how it does look at the from I like
that it's got thin like those thin
straps as well but again this color of
the pan is so me I love like white and
kind of like yellow and just orange and
that inner someone's got a bit of line
is it's not going to
through which is good because I find it
so hard to find things that are white
that aren't see-through and but this is
a see-through so I absolutely love it
and I can't wait to wear it it's like
that needs because they nice like my
other stuff so the next thing I got was
this really nice news kind of Lacey up
type miniskirt and of the shade of it
and then it also just paired it with
this really cute white crop top so yeah
I was pretty paired this with some
strappy heels
or some putting on something and just
like a little clutch bag was going out
and also going to cute with some wedges
I absolutely love this okay so I then
got this three piece set which is shorts
a little crop top and then it comes with
a jacket as well again obsessive disco
lights so nice and well if I could
burgundy deep red shade so the bottoms
are in small and the tops and a medium
and then also I love that the jacket
goes with it's very nice I would pretty
words from the evening again pair it
with some strawberry hair or something
like that
and yes I love that pretty much the
early swimwear that I wore my lasting
one of days was white box boutique I
suspect they fit so nicely and the
designs are just me I really like
playing somewhere just playing and I
don't got those bottoms that kind of
like come in like that where they kind
of I too tight and they make a varmint
shirt so I've got this red one she's so
nice this is the top I don't actually
think my boobs are going to fit in and
start when putting ups and the sack and
get a different size because it's tiny
but I'm this color is just again going
to armor over town I love prioritizing
some arts Becca indeed but I was are
actually like a song a song bottom but
I'm like I don't want our town lines on
my bar my mother so I just get my ASL I
don't care
okay so next we've got this olive
colored bikinis leave the bottoms and
these are a scrunch balm which is
basically what I shall explain earlier I
like spongebob bikinis I just think they
look nice and they fit better and they
don't it's not as practical it's not
really a song it's just like a yeah
she's gathered in the middle so you
don't get that cut do you not I mean if
you guys know what I'm talking about but
I love these soft ones anyway so I've
got this collaboration nice and olive
again with a fan loving life and this is
what the top looks like
so this is the same bikini that I had in
orange
I am had this bikini in a bright orange
shade which will be still my Instagram
so nice solo yeah I just love the colors
of the white fox boutiques where I like
the colors are just so many and I
thought it you can't get these bikinis
in the UK I've looked everywhere you can
get kings others so so this bikini is
from the Iran agreement range I did
color it's just I can't even this color
is just so on where I'm upset these are
the bottoms are really cute and I like
to go with detail on the side and then
put the top looks like the top is so
cute as well so you guys like this and
then at the back piece cool straps are
this on the back today I've got a full
bath full swimsuit I love them too too
much little bikinis but I tend to them
bikinis Langara better town but I do
love swimsuits as well so I did have
this one in white and I just got it in
black as well again from the shiny
grummond range love her love these
swimsuits and so yeah I had this one ey
I were on holiday in and I just got it
in black as well but I will link all of
this stuff down below in the description
box if you guys want to get any of it
and then I've got some accessories I've
got some sunglasses because I am
obsessed with sunglasses I feel like you
can never have too many pairs do you
know it means it just depends on read
them in what's unless I want to wear so
a person sunglasses and I was obsessed
when I found out that white folks bikini
have key sunglasses because we all know
that if I confess sunglasses over so the
first pair I've got wear these ones
they're like bit big and round I don't
have a veil at this see the person's
about marriage
big aviators for five years this is why
I live for so that's the first pair that
I got slated as often key and you can
get them from white box petite loving
life they come with a little white thing
we fit them in which is cool so they
don't get scratched because mind gets
scratched all the time then I've got
these ones these ones it is all black
and I love these as well
so I feel like these are more like
airports on glasses do you don't you
mean
and these have a summer since I would
walk one at two o'clock
one asterisk the airport early I look
like we've just rolled out there so
I'll just whack me some glasses on put a
little track suit on for airport this is
what I do buy lipstick they love all
black sunglasses just much like a big
 ABS yeah and then the last robot
wear these is I'm not sure if this is it
anyone's oh what you don't know evens
already
I didn't say maybe they're not
apparently although they are the brown
ones that were faded guess to these as
well so these ones are the brown ones
and they're like a little bit faded and
I don't know which ones are dendi's in
which ones are I feel like evil eyes are
but it doesn't say anyway okay so the
factors like sushi is fat but the first
ones are like I'm a boss bitch
look at me
and the second ones are like I've just
run out of air upon asking our makeups
like sunglasses and these ones are more
like I'm just going to have some daytime
swag like I was going to put some six
track suit on some slides and what moves
on just to go run some errands in town
do you see I'm saying these are like
running errands type sunglasses the
second ones I like I've just run out
about I def going to the airport I look
some tires top sunglasses and the first
ones are like I'm a boss bitch
look at me cut sunglasses this is why I
have to have so many cuz it depends what
mood I'm in you know anyway anyway so
