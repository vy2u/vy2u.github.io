I start thinking again about
hi everyone so today I'm going to be
filming to talk through video I'm just
gonna I'm really thought about what sort
of eye look I want to do I recently just
got some eyeshadows from makeup geek
because they're available to get in the
UK viability be calm so I recently just
got the eyeshadows and I don't really
know what look I want to do but I just
want to play around and see what happens
basically so we're just gonna see what
happens I've already primed my eye using
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer this is
an NC 20 and just added some tape just
to make sure it's just things nice and
neat I'm just prevent some fallout as
well so yeah the iPhone is I got these
ones right here so I think I'm gonna go
for maybe like okay pinky cranberry type
I look maybe I don't know we're just
gonna see how this works out so I think
from like transition shade transition
shade I'm gonna be using a peach
smoothie I've never used these
eyeshadows before so this is the first
impression so yeah just gonna go in with
that and I'm using the affairs face
efore t tapered blending brush it feels
weird because I haven't done a video in
so long obviously I've been on holiday
and then I was meant to be putting up my
holiday footage but whenever I'm I
realize is like four hours of footage to
go through most of its crap so I'm just
gonna I've been going through and
sorting out like the bits I want to keep
and what want to been anything it's just
taking me quite a while so now I think I
want to go in with think I'm going over
Mango Tango I'm just going to apply this
to my crease
I'm just trying to build up this color
because I don't want to just apply apply
sorry and too much straightaway I'm so
I'm basically just going to keep
building the color up and today I'm
happy obviously the more product to you
apply the darker it's gonna get so I
don't want it to go to that I'm gonna
take the Sigma tapered blending brush
I'm just gonna just wait a little bit of
my mac fix+ because i want to apply the
same color go Mango Tango but I want it
to look a bit darker
and then I'm gonna go back with my
fierce face tapered blending brush I'm
just gonna blend that up slightly
make sure there's no harsh line also is
the craziest thing when I went on her
day I've met one of my subscribers I'm
her last day I mean it was my first day
and I was just like this is crazy like
how am i bump into people like on in the
Caribbean like it's just weird like
because like when it comes to
subscribers like they might subscribe if
you don't actually put that in to people
that you don't think of it like that so
then when you see people and they're
know who you are it's like how do you
know me I don't think I'm gonna go in
with this rate what's this shirt my tie
my tie is I don't know if they catch me
I'm just gonna go in with that I'm just
gonna deploy who's gonna fly that like
up here so just to put my crease
and now I can't decide whether to use I
think gets to be that one okay don't
worry I've decided I'm going to be he's
in in the spotlight and this is the
foiled shadow I was gonna apply this all
right over the are dead I can just tell
us it's gonna be such a nice color
that door one applies much to the outer
part of my eye but more to the inner
part of my eye because this is where the
smokey bit is so I want to keep that
darker
obviously this is a light shadow so
so the winged eyeliner up and I
had to redo the whole thing again so if
it looks slightly different that's why
and I'm gonna attempt was gone again but
I'm not gonna do it from around like
this because I think that's how
it up so I'm just gonna do it how I
normally do it cuz I'm literally doing
your makeup like this so that you guys
can see it easily it's actually regional
um yeah
anyway next time you said it up
again
so now I'm just gonna bust mascara and
I've been using recently the lower lash
architect for D oh it's got all right
really like it
and now for false lashes I'm gonna be
using this thorough UK look lash as it
plays pretty much always in okay so why
why are my eyelashes are dry in I'm just
gonna move on to my face makeup safe a
primer as always I'm going to use the
new government post shave balm it's
today like going over 30 degree heat in
the Caribbean to being like yeah it's
just a joke so I'm in so cold here
hating then okay because one days is
some bad I'm red I'm using the berry my
advice the color corrector one the green
one I'm just gonna apply some this to my
nose which I'll reduce any redness also
this is good at minimizing pores that
I'm screaming a five in as well okay
save the foundation I'm going to be
using the dual skin and this is the
airbrush foundation this is in honey
beige the reason why I've got a dark one
is because I've just been on my day so
I'm quite on so yeah that's me what a
shake and then I just like to spray some
I just bright like that and then just
use my Pete you better just to vent out
apply some more because I like poker
bridges and you see no breaking coverage
if tonight build-up right I believe we
can spray it in your hair or dick and
when you use the Maybelline fit me
concealer and this is in shade oh it
does it say I think is like light maybe
okay well we've got our nose but
he cares Yolo it I think I fixed it
did I fix it oh I don't even write
pretty excel hot mess
okay so I'm not gonna set that using the
newer Messier setting powder
while some just leaving that to you and
baked I'm going to contour new things so
I'm gonna use white always use
other Stasia Pony Hills contour palette
and this is in medium I do believe I'm
gonna be using shade cinnamon on this I
like a broken record but I am I'm just
gonna use this uncool contour brush by
fair space this is number f40
okay so now you're using my mr. right
brush my teeth face I'm just going to
brush off this excess powder
so I'm just gonna go over my winged line
I'm still great but with the sick of my
gel liner and wicked because I thought
this is like a really black eyeliner and
whether it's either not dries the
maybelline won't it goes kind of like
more of a grey like a dollar guys I
could rise up a dark gray doesn't stay
black so I'm just going over it
so now I'm just going to be using the
same as well the same scar used and you
had the glory oh lush architects 4d
let's go I'm just gonna apply some to
the exertion it's funny require this day
they caught was just pissing me off is
just no good day
so next I'm gonna finish up my eyes I'm
crazy I'm not up so I take my
medium sweep at 8:54 brush by Sigma I'm
just gonna take the shade voices Mango
Tango and apply this to my bottom lash
line
hey so now I'm just gonna apply some
mascara to my bottom lashes since so
many people doing that no mirror makeup
challenge and I'm just like no I cannot
do it it looks like really good like oh
did you see jump in here do it like what
the hell like I popped my winged
eyeliner everything else just looks so
good
anyone that can do window I know but
remember our needs a reward

last one smashed so he said he just boy

my foreheads I'm just gonna go in for

over like we don't get another four
hours to film this video because had
some reason not I make up like three
times and say full lips I'm going to use
