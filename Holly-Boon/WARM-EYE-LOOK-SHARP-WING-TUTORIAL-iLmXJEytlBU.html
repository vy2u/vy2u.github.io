am using eyeshadow base and I use the
top shape tape concealer and just set it
with a powder and on my eyebrows the
benefit precious eyebrows and get
schooled so I'm going to be using the
modern renaissance running song from the
home on the chariot and I'm sorry buddy
Hills palette with six like this - if
she covered in makeup
not even okay so first of all I'm going
to start with this shade right here
which is called raw Sienna I'm just
going to apply that just about my crease
for my transition color the brush irony
there is the Sigma to finish the crease
brush the ep8 yeah I'm just going to
apply it in the crease and then blend it
up slightly just put my transition color
okay so after that I'm going to go in
with this shade here which is called
burn orange and I'm just going to focus
this color in the crease
using the same brush I'm going to blend
this color up slightly not as high as
the transition color just itchy Bend
upper lip or tiny rest and then just
going to take this brush from backstage
brushes it's called the eye Brenda brush
this has got an eye product on this
brush and I'm just going to make sure
those two shades then discover some it's
you're going to go over those two shade
so next I'm going to go in with this
shade right here and I'm going to apply
this in the crease and the outer corner
of the eye and I'm going to be using the
Sigma e30 six blending brush this is
like a really tiny blending brush is
this so easy to apply the product with
this brush this is like one of my
favorite brushes
and then it for Mercedes color I want it
the outcome of my eyes so I'm going to
just apply it there as well to about
halfway now I'm going to go in my Sigma
defuse to crease brush which I used to
apply the shade in the crease and go
over that I haven't asked you fight
anymore product hunters brush I'm just
going to blend out the edges so now I'm
going to take the top shaped tip
concealer us I'm just going to carve out
my lid I usually - about half way and
then I'm just going to friend it blend
it out slightly so I want to keep this
outer part of my eye and that orange
color
you
okay so going back in with my Sigma II
36 brush just put a bunny little bit
more this orange shade I'm just going to
go over the outer corner just to make
sure that blends out of business say for
my leg color I'm going to be using this
shade right here I'm just going to apply
this shade on top of where I just decide
that concealer so next for my winged
liner I'm going to take the Sigma gel
liner in wicked condition my favorite
gel liner of all time I saw Scott and
I'm going to use my Sigma you know six
winged liner brush as well
so I never worry too much about this
part what I hear being too neat because
what I like to do is wrap my finger
around the main cup wipe like this and
then just clean up this edge here
sharpens that up and you are good
to go
you want your eyeliner jet matte
jet-black this next step you need to do
so I used to stick my gel liner because
I find it easier to use gel liners to
actually carve out the wing and then I
do liquid but liquid always to me a
little bit darker than gel so I don't
like to apply the Sigma line a liquid
line on top this liquid liner is so mat
and so black I don't think you can get
any darker than this okay so for lashes
I'm going take from my cocoa dashes and
what so I like to use my tweezers to
apply my lashes I think it's a lot
easier
you want to come from a bar Blackbeard
and I always stick the middle first and
adjust the edges afterwards
okay so for Prime I'm going to take the
hemp you have extra extra from
moisturize and like I said this is my
favorite which ties are some can use
this to prime my skin because I've seen
a little bit dry yes this tracksuit and
when our skin is victory
so anyone wondering is Victoria Secrets
it's attracting kind of day you know
tracksuit will be yes burning out fine
and I'm going to be using the hourglass
stick foundation is shade golden tan lot
I know is this is extortionate this is
such an expensive product but it's like
amazing I can't even explain I wouldn't
tell you to go and buy this if I didn't
truly believe it was blast the money
because it's 14 pounds and you don't get
a lot of product but I think it's worth
it but in a way you please you shouldn't
buy it because you'll get addicted to it
and then keep spending 40 to find the
foundation so I don't know yeah tastes
so good I love it so much I'm spending
this in the movie bender but anyway I've
applied foundation we went in mind you
don't used to do it like given you use
concealer so that's just extra for X's
and Y's which I didn't need to do well
done honey
so for concealer I'm going to take the
chart shape tape concealer this is a
very expensive product again I really
need to try and find more affordable
products for you guys because I don't
want you to have to spend those them on
it's annoying it's a sign land but
consider is so good you guys is so good
it's so sore coverage really really need
to bend really nice love it I've got one
of QVC from the UK and I've got shade
light/medium
but there but the maybelline age rewind
is just good so I just want to see what
the height was doing about because
everyone's been like saying how amazing
it is and it is actually amazing to be
sir they just died okay so I just
assumed doing stuff with it would be a
lot but I actually got to see exactly
what I'm doing
so I'm just going to set that with my
Laura Mercier translucent powder i did
like the RPM a powder but it's a bit
messy like still container and stuff
while I was getting pilot everywhere so
I do like that powder but just decided
to use my Laura Mercier today the both
just a good if you Thomas Drummond new
bitch is already no longer needs to
bronze my Mac gives me son
bonsoir watch the skin finish it's just
so good okay it's so good I just cause
clown outfit so I'm going to apply it
using my angled powder brush by
backstage brushes contour and when you
use my a nostalgia of Beverly Hills
contour kit the powder kit can you see
the light to medium and winter darkest
shown here and this stipple brush from a
Lottie London a lightly brushes are
really good they're drugstores wrath and
I like expensive so do any good
I'm then gonna just sharpen up a comes a
little bit I'm going to take this to
through and trim corn so bashed by six
Martin should be at seventy-seven brush
I'm just going to take some one writer
on Mercier translucent powder on this
brush and just apply some of it under my
contour this cleans it up a little bit
makes it a little bit more sharp brush
I'm going to take the sweet peach grower
palette and there's a brush shade in
hand about should be loving it it's
really gorgeous creamy pink trade and
it's so nice like I literally love it
it's a little bit of blowing it as well
which obviously we love so I am going to
apply this using my Too Faced mr. white
powder brush
going to quickly dust off this powder as
you can see it just made it show off a
miracle at one eat more chiseled it's
another calm going for today signs in my
eye I'm going to go for a pink a pink
ishe going to take this shade from this
color and apply this under my lower lash
line brush I'm using is do smudge e 21
brush by Sigma so to highlight the inner
corner of my eye I'm going to take this
chain right here which is the shade that
I use and for my lid color
by highlight first we're going to take
the iconic London illuminator drops you
know happen about these these are like
my ride-or-die and I know they keep
selling out so keep an eye on the
websites we want to get them you can use
code holy b10 and you get money off
so they want a more intense highlight
I'm going to use the iconic on edge as a
highlight palette and I'm going to take
this highlight and illuminate shade here
which is so bright and so crazy by love
it I'm gonna spray my a nostalgia eight
to three brush with some six five
this one is by CR T London what sure
that they say it I'm sorry it's not I
say it but anyway this liquid it stick
is called be too sweet I think these are
like quite new I'm not sure
