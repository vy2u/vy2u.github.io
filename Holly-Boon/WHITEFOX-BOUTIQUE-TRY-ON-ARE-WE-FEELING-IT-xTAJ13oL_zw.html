channel and hello if you're new here
welcome hi this is the night for tempted
Natalya's intro and it's rihana alright
anyway so today I'm gonna be trying on
some clothes in from whitefox boutique
they were just some stuff a while ago
and it's just been sucked that I've just
been like I need to film a video and I
really wonder whatever it like I always
wear stuff the other day but I was like
no no no wait for my video uh-huh anyway
so yeah we're here filming the video
just get all of it and make sure to give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoy it
and make sure to subscribe
I'll also link all the items in the
description box below in case you want
to get any of it also I do have a
discount code with whitefox I don't know
what the discount code is it's Eva Holly
or Holly 15 I'm not sure try both and
because some people try just Holly and I
didn't work and then I was like twelve
or fifteen and it worked so just try
both I'm just gonna say cuz I don't
actually know if that's my code or not
but anyway anyway anyway anyway right
let's just get into the video okay so I
have got just like two random backdrops
it's my wall so just ignore that I
couldn't bother sitting down I couldn't
be so I slept in there okay so just
don't worry about that just quick this
top is also from whitefox boutique I got
this a while ago and I love it I love
this color and these are just some cycle
shorts from cradle thing without further
ado let's get on with the video
so first thing I want to try on are
these jokers with this body suit if you
followed me for a while you know Oh
although way is Java some body suits
nineteen centers homeless issue you're
always so yeah I'm going to get these
because they're really cute and ping and
I thought pink just think about the pink
at the minute like money on the pink
real time I've just got to think about
things
so yeah pink dog is cute and then this
white bodysuit
I got these they're the Pharos sweat
pansy baby pink in a size small and then
I've got this body sick with a white
robe bodysuit
in a size small as well so this is what
the joggers would look like there's got
the black string and they're really that
they're tight at the bottom which I like
I like skinny joggers and it's got white
fox active written there in black down
the leg which is really cute so I really
wish we could
to me they want to do this I've just put
some background music on we could get
laid just you know I mean but I don't
forget some copyrights and can't do that
can't do it so annoying this is the
bodysuit so it's a room 42 it's got four
buttons at the front it was really cute
and summery and I love all right I think
you'll agree now to the joggers so yeah
I'm gonna try on like a sec okay so this
is what this looks like
I think it's really cute I love this
body suit and I love these joggers I've
had these drugs before in red and I love
them they're like so so Pompeii worm all
the time so these pink ones are so cute
I love them I love it here we are we an
on the beds 16 to go out there cuz my
room is too small
but yeah this is what the joggers look
like I love how they're just really
tight there and they feel really nice
and I think they're eager bodysuits
I'm already super knows of things but I
love bodysuit ajob it's like this cuz it
looks cute it's really comfy and I like
being comfy also don't you feel like
this body suit see-through and I don't
have anything on underneath and like no
bra no nipples nothing I don't feel like
it's see-through or pretty guys to edit
this don't you see throwing up like
yeah don't think it doesn't looks either
in the mirror so I did get a couple of
denim skirts I got some like blue denim
and then spreads enemies or three kids
I'm gonna try these by phone with just
46 I don't have another top to try on
with I've got both of these in a size a
and yeah this is the pretty one this is
the first one it is so hot in here
I'm new she's sweating off the peg
wetting like a pig why is that I say it
like two pigs sweat today they sweat a
lot I don't know maybe obviously
probably okay so I'm just on my tiptoe
so you can see this guy yeah this is the
red one I really like how I think I
never normally wear this sort of thing
like I'm normally like trousers or
chakras or jeans or like I don't be wear
skirts I don't normally but I really
like this yes from me I like it
the only thing is it's a little bit
short at the back it's a little bit
short at the back and I don't like the
backs of my legs so what's think about
the right back on my legs I don't know
is it just an art though does anybody
else have
problem right when you try and get it
like jeans or anything not over your ass
like it fits your waist but you know
anyhow yes this is the blue denim white
and I think I prefer this one to the red
one is it a little bit longer
I like this got the rips and I just
think the blue looks better
see I definitely prefer this one to that
red one cuz yeah it's a bit longer when
it comes down further at the back it's
not as sure as that one and I really
like the RIP detail I think it looks
good looks good looks it's good the dark
it's oh my god it is so on it cut down I
do
this is diluted by the way this isn't to
stop me drinking it straight you know I
mean there was that that my flipside
food up water proofing can now
she's drinks out the bow with some of
her the I would open the window but it's
so noisy outside
it's all this lights it's the lights and
make so hot but if I can't say it was so
serious has donned her can't catch her
myself in the mirror light up okay next
thing I'm dreading trial is on because
I've said it's boiling on it and these
James and again these are some black
kings and they've got this nice like
lace detail down the front which I
really like and they're kind of like oh
I don't know you call it they're like
I'm off black they're not like black
black you don't you mean I've got these
in the size small these are the offbeat
lace-up skinny jeans
oh yeah wash track so they're just like
an off black but they're really nice and
they're stretchy which I like I like
stretchy jeans and just so much comfier
and then I also got this top from white
fox as well I've worn this before that's
why the label was on it this is from
white fox and it's just like an
off-the-shoulder
like one sleeve top I really like it so
I'm gonna pair this with the jeans see
what it makes tonight I don't know what
it is but when I film these videos
always get really hyper like I just love
doing these gimmicks so I did okay so
this is what this outfit looks like I
did get foundation on my top nice so
annoying it's so annoying I'm just so
annoyed but anyway I love these jeans
they fit really nice they're really
comfy like they're nice
- like this like they've got some room
which I like because I don't like them
when they're so tight and stiff like I
hate jeans like that they have to be
stretchy and comfy
I like this lace up detail the front I
think it's really cute and it's
different about having a button I don't
have any to use like this I really like
that so just sit up here so you guys can
see what it looks like from them but
yeah really are these jeans really comfy
nice - stretchy I like this make
something sell here like that that I've
been off black and I really I love this
type of woman stop before I got makeup
on it
next thing I ordered with its dress this
is more like evening stuff now so I've
got this dress which you could wear this
dress in the day I feel like gross
material so you could kind of make it
casual or dress it up and then I've got
two really dressy styles and then I'm
gonna show you some swimwear I'm not
gonna try on this one wear because oh my
god my other swim my trial on home video
where tribal swimwear and I've got like
an email from Google to say somebody to
report on it for nudity and it been age
restricted and I was like oh okay
so no good on bikinis as talks about
something else but I'm going to show you
some things that he makes L of those so
yeah this is what this dress looks like
it's got this tie bit on the front here
I love this burgundy color this burgundy
color with my black hair wasn't really
nice I like it and it's really nice and
stretchy if it was already soft as well
and this one is in a size 8 okay so this
is the stress I love this this is so
comfortable is so soft I love the core
of it I love that it's top rope material
and yeah it she's really really
comfortable if there's nice and thin and
lightweight I would actually wear this
in the day with some sandals
yeah this is what this looks like I love
it it's really really comfortable really
soft I like the room material
yeah I really like it it hasn't actually
been anything that I don't like so far
um which is good obviously it's nothing
worse than when you order things and
you're like I'm not going to like it
yes so far so good I don't really what
was what n is the whores okay no how
many times Western it's really hot I
think someone say it something it
actually don't do that says a lot under
18 to watch my video
I study that don't do that they do that
the next thing this is like a really
nice flowy dress and I saw some that it
looked amazing on the model when I was
like hey I'm gonna try it this is
something that I would wear I would have
got hotter then it got out in the
evening it's just really nice okay and
this again is in a size small don't
actually know how this works how does
this go on it's confusing just go get
that Chris man there don't go over my
head you're not oh sure you know doctors
know how does this work I'm so confused
I need to get the website up so I can
see how you put it on but surely my head
is not supposed to go through here
because I'm just telling ya my head a
bit free there oh okay I was gonna say
this bit goes around the neck and kind
of pulls that bit nice and we just
try and figure this out okay this one
needs an instruction manual husband um
because I have picked you to spend 20
minutes trying to put it on and I still
don't think I'm fit alright but it looks
like the picture so we just go of it and
I don't think I like this on me I think
it just looks weird on me like it looks
really amazing on the curl on the
website but I don't think this is like
me this is what it looks like Fullerton
I'm just doing that so you can't see my
vagina I mean I sorta go side problem
it's like that crinkle it looks like
it's creased it's supposed to look like
this I feel like I look like I'm wearing
one of those like medieval dresses
something's the neck that's what I'm
thinking
I mean I could be actually like okay so
this is the last one to try on clothes
and wise and then I'll show you some
swimwear and like I said a weight try
this with monks at all my videos get
reported can't be out of that again yeah
I've got this blue it's like a silky
dress I've had one of these up there
before I had it in like a brown color I
really liked it so
were you nice I think this blue color
would look better with my dark hair but
we'll see also I did get this in a size
small but yeah so this is what this one
looks like I think this will be amazing
as a prom dress they do these in so many
colors in the website they have this one
in Fred and I could nice off-white like
champagne color they do this in so many
colors and it's so nice I think if
you've got prom and you want something
that's quite simple and just nice I
think this is that perfect this is how
I've tied the back and tie it however
you want I just went around my neck they
weren't Brown my waist and decided at
the back we can tie it like so many
different ways so this is what it looks
like full length it's got the slit which
I really like and it's just like silky
material I love the color of it like I
said I've had this one before in a
different color and I just love love
love it a woman is in my Tenerife vlog
and if you guys remember like literally
over a year ago and when it's in memory
if we went to that steak restaurant and
I wore this in like a brown color okay
so I'm just gonna get changed back
inside comfy and then I'm going to show
you some swimwear my cuz I don't gonna
try this with my on for the same reason
though research like twice at against
this is annoying and yeah it changes out
of this okay so I just got change to
back into this and I'm gonna show you
some swimwear ladies you guys I was
asking about the swim I love what sizes
I get and what's happens and that kind
of stuff it's gonna show you the pink
one I did post on my Instagram I'll link
my Instagram time down below in case you
wanted to see what these look like on
and but this baby pink one was one of my
favorites I was on holiday just like oh
it said I foil it she loved it so I get
the top in a medium and I get a small in
all the bottoms you can get different
bottoms on the website like if you want
like a full bottom or if you want a
thong and this one is a thong I
personally prefer more of a scrunch prom
than this type of thing I don't have to
get my bomb like fully oh yeah you can
get this one or you can get scrunch bomb
or you can get a thicker band they have
so many of these bottoms in different
styles so you look she caters everyone
and that's the first one the pink one
and like I said if you want to see what
these it like on go over some Instagram
and
we'll see what they look like on the
second one I love this is like a ribbed
material and it's in red this is what
the top looks like it's more like that
sports bra kind of top but I love love
love this white and they also do this
one in like a baby blue color on there
and I love that like I would on holiday
as well it just looks so so good with
the tan it's just like Conrad and so
yeah this is the red one so that's what
the top looks like bottoms I like this I
like I said you can get so many
different bottoms with this just
depending on what you like you can like
get what whichever ones you want and but
yeah these ones I got with a thick band
love them and then the next one is this
baby blue one they do so many baby blue
ones on the website and I love the color
let's color is unreal and like I said
you can get this color in this style you
can get this color in like so me do the
Styles you can get this and this type of
style like whatever style you want and
so these are the bottoms for this one so
these are the bottoms or I prefer
they're a bit bigger at the back they're
not like a g-string but they're not like
too big and this top I love this top
this top goes like this to the front and
then it's crossed over at the back and
then it crosses over at the back like
that and then you just tie it and it's
so nice I love this one if you need me
for size reference I noted that I do
have a boob job and boob job sizes are
slightly different to like a real boob
sizes but there's still might help
anyway so boob size I'm a 32 double D so
I wear a medium in the top and then
clothes wise I'm like an 8 to 10 and I
get a small in the bottoms and that's
perfect
but yeah so I will link everything that
I tried on down below I'll also link
this swimwear don't forget about my
discount code which is either wholly or
wholly 15 like I said try either I'm not
sure which one works and try them both
