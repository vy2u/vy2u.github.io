whitefox boutique to bring you this
video because when I go on holiday I
look she just wear white fox swimwear
it's the only swimwear that I like I
just like playing somewhere other
patterns on it I just like playing
fitted and I have a certain type of
swimwear that I like is in bottom wise I
like scrunch balm I don't like the ones
that cut you off so yeah this video is
sponsored by white fox boutiques I'm
going to show you all the ones I've got
and try them on as well I did a little
clip to ourselves and holiday me wearing
them so you guys can see what they look
like on so just quickly about shipping
and import tax because I get asked this
a lot and I am lucky enough to get sent
to swimwear from this brand and so I
don't know if that makes any difference
in pay an import tax or anything but
I've know how to pay anything but then I
have had stuff sent to me from America
before and I'll still have to pay import
tax so I don't really know and from
being completed on it the best people to
contact will probably DHL because I know
this is the delivery company that brings
it to me so it probably best to contact
them or ask white folks you might email
them or anything like this I honestly
don't know about that and in regards to
how long it takes to calm I would say
allow up to two weeks if you're in the
UK because I he is coming all the way
from the other side of the world so
please do allow two weeks if you're
going on holiday just give yourself two
weeks enough time for it to arrive
because sometimes it'll get here really
fast and there's some time to take
longer so yeah just allow enough time so
the past swimwear is this one it's
really cute I love the color it's like a
fuchsia pink and it's three hours of a
tan
the top path is strapless and like this
and then at the back it's got this
little clasp that um do up but yes the
top is strapless this is good for those
tanning days when you just don't want to
get strap strap mark towns or whatever
and then the bottoms again are a scrunch
bomb which is what I love yet also I do
like to wear and mind quite high up just
because my legs are short so I like to
make it like a foot long and I explain
tickly so that's why I always wear my
high-rise and not I'm just straight I
always pull them up like that
and that's just my personal preference
to make my legs look longer because I am
like five foot four and yeah and the
second one is why it's kind of like a
scrunchie materials are really showing
you miserably it's so nice I lay this up
at the front and it's backless as well
it's really really good it's good it's
laced up at the front because you can
put it in tight so kind of like keep
your boobs in place I love full swimsuit
dress and much love bikinis but I don't
wear full swimsuits as masters because I
like to tan but if I'm going to like a
pool party and stuff or anything that I
do like to wear and force them to but
this one is so so comfy I just love the
scrunchie material and again I always
pull mine up suits like high-rise like I
just put it off my leg more that makes
sense just again to make money longer
okay so the third line is this red color
this red color is unreal Vuitton red is
like one of my favorite colors anyway
but I love to wear red bikinis when I
have a town I just think it just looks
so nice the top is basically like a bra
and type of thing it's got class at the
back and like adjustable straps which is
good and yes to the cat priests and by
the way anyone has been for me for a
long time knows I love a Capri Sun so
yes to that listen and then this bottoms
are song bottom but I don't care I get
my arse out as I'm laughs - I mean I
like tan I like I don't have a white
bonnet on body so I don't mind getting
myself so got me and you don't care then
these bottom hospitalized okay so this
next one is from the shiny grim room
range shout-out to shiny it love her
lovely swimwear is so unreal and this is
just like up black a one-piece it's so
nice it fits really well it's structured
same with the friends it is the back
which safe has got big boobs pre you
probably want tip tape - where else I'm
going to be honest because Follette your
boobs might fall out but it's really
nice I already have this one in white
and I do believe they have a few more
shades of this which is nice so yes so
this next one is this kind of like
perfectly colored one piece I love this
it's a scoop neck
run and then at the back it's kind of
like a scoop again but it goes lower so
it's a bit more backless this is
gorgeous I love this and also again this
color of the tan is just unreal okay so
this next one this gray one is
definitely my favorite out of all of
these because you can tie it different
ways so the way I've tied it is I've
crossed over at the front and then tied
it at the back but you can cross over
the back part at the back you can you
can just wear this one in so many
different way and I love that so and
also this color is just so pretty I just
love this light gray and these bottoms
are they're not quite fun but they're
not they're not on there just like a bit
I search is a slightly bit bigger than
the song but they fit really well I wear
a size small in the bottom and a medium
and the top in these bikinis and then
with the full like the one pieces I wear
small but yet I always get a medium in
the top okay then this last one I
actually loved it like some people do
you think like what's up but because
it's like a velvet material but I
actually love this so much and I love
the color of it it's like a deep purple
and it's just like yeah it's velvet it's
like really nice it feels really nice
it's really soft I love it and again
it's got like these thin straps on the
side it's crunch bomb at the back which
is what I live for and then this top is
the same as the gray one I just showed
you but I tried it differently in this
video but yeah I love this one so that
is all the swimwear I have so much of
white box boutique swimwear people
millions to gram you know whenever I'm
on holiday the only swimwear I ever wear
is a white box boutique
I'm just so fasting when it comes to
swimwear and I like it to fit me
properly
I like scrunch bond bikinis I like just
plain colors I don't like patterns
I just want plain and I just love the
ties that they have on the white fox
boutique website they have like Riina's
carpi colors the gray they had this new
color which is unbelievable with like a
yellow and and they said go in the
bikinis I love it it's really amazing
but I okay I'll save up and basically I
had it all I was off in my life yes yes
yes lovely no yellow beautiful on
reverse and I went in the pool wet my
hair
get in I only dyed my hair like two days
before that so it's gone in the pool or
through the chlorine kind of like took
some of the hairs out of my hair
so I just sitting there like chilly
wondering where everyone's on sunbathing
and my hair a direct of this it was wet
and it died my swimsuit like a green and
I was like shit so the yellow one that
