Christmas makeup look I just want to
quickly start by saying I used this
flawless color corrector primer by Barry
M and I'm really obsessed of it it's
obviously gonna reduce redness because
it's the color green and it also
minimizes your pores and it's so good
like I never used drugstore products and
I picked this up yesterday and I am like
obsessed with this now my redness went
down so much and the pore minimizing is
just so good so yeah you want to find
out how i got this makeup look then keep
watching original my eye brows and i've
just concealer on to leave my eyebrows
and i'm still do my foundation so i'm
gonna be using the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation and I did you like the first
impressions they have a date and I and
I've been using it since and I'm
actually quite impressed of it like I do
like it I could I wasn't sure at first
but feel like you need to give them a
bit of time because like sometimes when
you wear it more than once it's like it
starts to go on like things like dry
patches or it just starts to look like
not as good so I had to sort of like
give it time but yeah I do like it I
definitely prefer it to the Mac Studio
Fix fluid because the Mac Studio Fix
fluid suck food oxidizes on my skin and
it goes quite orange it's not if you
want like for super full coverage it's
not the best because you have to kind of
like layer it on to get a full coverage
but it is a good foundation anyway
so now I'm just going to go in to start
doing my eyes so I'm going to be
probably my I use in the mac studio
finish concealer in NC 20 so I recently
this is the pot if anyone has this it
she runs out so quick because the pot so
small I basically got the Mac full
coverage foundation in NC 20 and it's
basically just a bigger version of this
so if you want to get this I recommend
getting this I think this is only 5
pound more and obviously you get a lot
more product so definitely recommend
getting that then I'm going to go over
to Laura Mercier setting powder and I'm
just gonna set that because as you can
see it's just creased
so if I shot it I'm gonna be using the
morphe 35o palette which is this one I'm
just gonna be using these brown shades
around here so that was going to be my
transition shade and then I'm gonna go
in with this one and then this one and
then this dark one in the out corner and
the brush the reason is the first phase
II 25 tapered blending brush so now
going in with that slightly darker shade
I'm just gonna apply that into my crease
as well but I'm just going to try and
keep that more to the outer corner of
the eye
so then they say my Brendan brushing my
face face this is the e-40 brush and I'm
just gonna blend those two shades
together it's just like no harsh lines
blending in
okay now I'm gonna go in with my Sigma
and a 54 brush I'm gonna be applying a
darker Brown to the outer corner yeah
when we apply this to the outer corner
of the eye you want to keep it on the
outer corner you don't want to bring it
across you just want to just pack this
color on and I'm just going to blend out
so now I'm gonna be going in with a
darker Brown and it's not black but it's
like just off black and really really
dark brown but he's really keep that
again
in the outer corner of your eye and not
above your crease line and you just want
to pack that color on and I'm using the
same brush again
so now taking the glam crystals dozen in
gel liner by collection mm this is a
gold I'm just going to be applying this
to the inner corner of my eye lid to
about halfway and just blend it out
I'm just gonna apply some mascara before
I apply my false lashes I guess now I'm
gonna be using the demure lashes so I
get sent a lot of lashes from different
companies and I'm very fast even for a
work with say you guys know that I used
to roam UK all the time because I live
for them but recently I've got sent
these lashes from Jimmy lashes and they
asked him want to work with them and I
was like oh my god yes like definitely I
use their lashes a few times and I'm
obsessed so they sent me the mink crash
collections and they just sent me like
the normal ones so it's synthetic ones
I'm going to use synthetic ones today
just because I'm not as dramatic and I
just don't want my eyes to be too much
and these are Chloe dashes I have a
discount code it's Holly B and you get
15% off and I think these synthetic
lashes are only like 5 pounds so then
you get 15% off to fuse my code and also
the mean batteries are really really
good they last forever like you can just
keep reusing them and reusing them and I
think they're like 15 pounds um but yeah
it was so I've been using this lash glue
it's they're lush gray as well and
that's really good I'm like enough
so now I'm going to be going to move the
back up under I correct corrector yeah
I'm just gonna apply this under my eye
so now to conceal my under I'm going to
be using the Mac and from coverage
foundation and NC 20
I'm gonna set that I don't want to be
here just wanna set and I'm gonna be
using the morphe m-104 brush this is
actually a contour brush but I'm gonna
use it to set
contour I want to be using the face
contour care to the pressed powder and
on highlighter and wine and this is by
sleek this is in shade light so and I'm
gonna be taking that more free and 104
brush again I've not actually uses the
console yet so we're gonna see how this
goes
okay so this is a little palette by
sleek and I'm loving the bronzer and I
use the highlighter yesterday and this
highlighter shade and I'm gonna show you
what it's like because it is so
bomb like I'm obsessed so when we take
my highlight brush by zoeva I'm gonna
show you what's it's like you don't need
to be spending 30 grid on a highlight up
because this is ten pound this little
palette thing and the cons are is so
good and look at this highlight so this
is the fierce face e30 pencil brush and
I'm just going to apply some highlighter
to the inner corner of my eye line that
same exact idea
so now I'm going in with a fierce face a
55 I shade in brush and I'm just going
to go in with not the really dark brown
but the like second from darkest Brown
from the morphe 35o palette I'm just
gonna apply this to my under eye I
didn't want to go stuck halfway I don't
want to go all the way across I'm just
going to apply some mascara to my bottom
lashes
so now lastly for lips and would I be
taking the Max Factor lipliner in Shea
red rush just gonna line my lips with
this
today I'm taking a review by Mac and
it's gonna tie this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
