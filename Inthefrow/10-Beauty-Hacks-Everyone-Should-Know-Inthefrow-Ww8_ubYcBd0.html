going to be a beauty hacks video so many
YouTube's have made a similar video to
this especially rock soros and kosher
Beauty news channels I really really
love and I just wanted to put all
together with all of my own beauty hacks
my own beauty tips and the hacks I
actually use so not just things that you
could use they're a little bit bizarre
or random but the things I actually do
use and I would highly recommend let's
get right in with hack number one if you
have quite thin hair or hair that is
quite flat naturally I would highly
recommend drying your hair upside down
take your usual hair dryer sit on the
into the bed flip your hair over and
just dry your hair with your hands run
your hands through your hair I think
grammar to do all of the work so let's
make sure you dry your hair upside down
until it's completely utterly dry flip
it over and your founder has so much
more for you is so much more body hack
number two this hat is all about washing
your brushes a lot of products out there
that would make you spend a lot of money
just to clean your favorite makeup
brushes all you may need are just some
household products again you could use
your own hair shampoo and conditioners
if you want to condition and shampoo
your brushes but and I would recommend
using a baby shampoo not only will a
baby shampoo be much more gentle on all
of your really expensive or beautiful
brushes you know keep this much better
condition you also find that baby
shampoo is a lot cheaper than your
favorite shampoos or your favourite
brush cleansers or anything else that
you use on your brushes cost less and
it's much better for your brushes hackin
number three if you really love to
contour everyday but you're finding it's
taking up a lot of your time in the
morning I would highly recommend
skipping that step and moving straight
into bronzer you can create very very
similar effects take your food brush you
take your favorite bronzer and you start
to bronze in number three shape so
imagine that your cheek
is the middle of the three and you work
it over the top around in the number
three shape you'll find that you'll
create a really easy bronze look that's
quite contoured and quite chiseled with
just an easy number three movement hack
number four if you love your cheekbones
extremely highlighted and glowing and
beautiful but you'll find it quite
difficult to find exactly where you want
to place your highlight
for me I find it's all about finding the
light find a light and make sure it
starts to hit the very top of your
cheekbones take your highlighter look
into the light as soon as the light
that's attached on your cheek that's we
can start to place your highlight
straight down on that beam just to
enhance the overall highlight hack
number five recent makeup trends have
all been about the eyebrows and
therefore there are so many different
eyebrow products on the market it's
quite difficult to know exactly what you
need to use for this hack I would highly
recommend just finding ourselves spoolie
spoolie is one of the best ways to get
natural well groomed of affected
eyebrows regardless of whether you fill
your eyebrows in with a pencil
or with a little pot and a brush really
is your Savior when it comes to making
sure the hairs are all in the same
direction excess product has been
removed and the brows are much more
perfected hack number six if you also
one that loves to wear eyeliner every
single day like I do but you're finally
it looks a little bit harsh on the eyes
it's making it eyes look a little bit
small try reverting over to a brown
liner seems quite simple but by just
changing over to brown from the black it
looks much more natural much more sultry
and can get away with it for any type of
occasion it still helps to make your
eyes stand out and look much more
prominent but without being so bold and
so harsh hack number seven if you have
really straight lashes and you're really
struggling to keep them killed all day
it's all about tailors and a waterproof
mascara I've tried and tested this
method for years and it's all about
keeping with the curlers on the lashes
for a minute or so plumping as you go
and holding them really steadily on the
lashes to make sure the curl is really
large perfected then and only then when
you're happy with your curl on the
lashes that's what you need to go in
with a waterproof mascara this is when I
favorites this is a clarence waterproof
mascara but you can try any that you
really really prefer with more of a
drive formula
dry the formula of the mascara the less
it's going to be wet on the lashes and
therefore help them to start to move
down again so when your lashes are
curled find a dry formula waterproof
mascara and coat your lashes and you'll
find the curl will hold all the day hack
number eight after you've applied your
eyeliner
new mascara and a beautiful eyeshadow
and you find that you've managed to get
the mascara wand or your eyeliner all
over your actual eyelid I know so maybe
I did this every single morning there
are a few ways to get around it and
clean it up perfectly first one
obviously being a cotton bud and taking
your favorite makeup remover just to
come to small amounts of product on
share cotton bud and then use a cotton
bud to wipe away large areas of mistakes
if you find that you have an eyeliner
issue and your eyeliner isn't quite on
point that day do the same thing this
time with a very slim brush put some
product on the brush and use the brush
to realign underneath the eyes remove
any excess that you may have left and
there's a third idea this is a prototype
and using a lot recently at the be brow
bar brow corrector it already has
product on the top of a little nib and
again you can use this to go onto your
brows go over any mistakes on your
mascara or to clean up your eyeliner
hack number nine this hat is all about
the lips and if you also want to who
loves to wear lipstick a lot but forgets
to line your lips first as a trick first
of all I would highly recommend you
start to do it really will help to make
it look so much more larger fuller and
more perfected this hack is about your
technique when you're lining if you line
your lips from below working upwards in
a more rounded motion up to your Cupid's
bow you will be left with a much more
fuller pout than if you line in a
straight line you line your lips in a
more of a straight line up to keep its
bow you find in the end your lips will
look much thinner and nowhere near as
plot whereas if you just work from the
outer corner up to your Cupid's bow in a
more rounded motion you'll find the end
result is much thicker plumper fuller
lips hack number 10 again if you want in
your lips look a little bit more full
why don't you try the ombre effect lip
it's much easier than you may think
and it only takes your favorite lipstick
and want more product the supplier
lipstick is normal and when you're happy
you can take a concealer or a very light
lipstick take a bit of the product and
dab it right into the center of the
bottom lip you can also work a little
bit into the inside of
as well once you blend in the product
you'll find you're left with an ombre
lip effect inside the lips will be like
to moving out to your favorite lipstick
color it literally takes two products
