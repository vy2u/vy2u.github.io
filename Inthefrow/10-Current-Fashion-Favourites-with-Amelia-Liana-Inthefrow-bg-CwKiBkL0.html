just filmed another video for a mean
this channel we did our top 10 unsung
Beauty hero yeah yeah so you've come on
the fashion video and over on Amelia's
channel is kind of a youtube video ok so
this video is going to be our 10 current
fashion favorites
so we've both dealt into our wardrobes
to find what we are loving the most
right now yeah so would you like to
start
okay oh I might start with box okay I'm
a bad person I freaking love love love
bags and this is my little YSL bucket
bag which I have been loving as these
suede tassels it's this gorgeous taupe
color
I didn't what's in my bag video recently
and in that video I said that it's kind
of a tiny bit inconvenient that you
can't fit that much in here but because
it's so beautiful I'm okay shoving stuff
in all my pockets yeah it's fine I'm
really okay with that such beautiful
quality so so so gorgeous and I love
they're kind of like drawstring fit at
the front and the little gold hardware
as well and you can wear it crossbody
which is how I normally wear it but it
does have a little strap there is a and
it's just it's such a gorgeous call it -
I love bad media okay I also have a bag
that an obsessed with at the moment and
it's my silene box back if I don't think
I've ever mentioned it on my channel
before but I put I mean I'm in the blue
everywhere before oh my gosh I didn't
think this would fit as much and then
when I said rummaged through Victoria's
bag I was like wow isn't that like one
two three little compartments even one
here as well okay
to anyone I can fill up the stuff in as
well yeah that's quite wide net to us so
really really like that so the way I've
been wearing this is just over my body
like complete cross body over the top of
a jacket I just think it looks quite
chic and quite nice so what I'll do is
because also these are designer if you
love designer perfect but if not I will
leave some examples down below in the
description bar awakened by alternatives
that look very very similar or very
similar style
I know Zara do a really good really good
bucket bag right now
yes so I'll leave all those down below
as well some little alternatives but
generally just these little tiny bags at
the moment I'm really looking rather
than like a big big I never carry big
bags anymore I love love love crossbody
bag yeah that means you stop put your
essentials in it yeah you don't end up
like carrying around everything my next
one is a who's gonna say roll net
because I read on that it's fun cheap
Monday I bought it from a sauce and it's
just plain black and white really simple
but then it has these kind of little
rips in them they're kind of what do you
call them like snags okay yeah it's
almost like I'm trying to cut out just
like threads the threads have stopped
being woven in that area and it does not
quite a bit so I think it just makes it
a bit more interesting
I've just been wearing this with like
jeans flats or like the little jeans and
boots and like the crossbody bag and I
love love love this and I love stripes
right now as well and it's really cozy
but it's quite thin to feel the material
it's not too thick that it makes you too
hot I love it so in fact my next one is
this roller which I know it's either
Victoria rolls I do I honestly do in
fact they also bought it in black it's
so nice I still love it it's a body like
this around for me yes it has poppers at
the very bottom and also it's so
difficult to get into I'll be honest
yeah he's really gonna pray hold it over
but because of night I just kind of like
you don't agree or make up for hard base
yeah literally so badly today I took off
my black one and it was cool
but in makeup but they're so flattering
a thing yeah and the fact that body just
took so neatly into jeans although the
trousers or whatever are skirts and you
don't get anything come out ride not
that's what qualities and it's so
affordable this one's from ASOS I love
it I'm gonna buy it you should know you
links down below these are a pair of
trousers I've been loving they're from
All Saints they're just your average
jeans but these have these like leather
panels over the knees blue leather
panels I think it's so interesting it's
really unusual
I just love wearing like my normal kind
of like normal casual clothes and then
having like a little mill something
interesting about them but yeah I'm
really liking these I think Andy's
brand-new in the reason I corals they
were maybe they're maybe like a year ago
but I think I keep them in quite a bit
bring out different variations I really
love this give us algae at the moment
it's like yeah it's gonna be one of my
faves
next thing I'm gonna mention yeah I
think how mentioned a favorite
potentially but it is this dress so it's
a shirt dress military style in a lovely
gray it's almost a bit of a blue gray
lavender gray I feel well it's just the
right length I think to wear without
feeling like you're showing off too much
to people I just think when it's kind of
pulled in so it's got this little belt
around the way so it pulls you in a
cinches you in
it's really quite flattering yeah and
it's been wearing this with a pair of
just simple black suede court shoes or
any kind of black shoes really nice
looks really really sweet and then again
with the saline bag you just saw like
black accessories
this is misguided I think it's just like
20 pounds or something it's 25 nice
I love the puppies pockets yeah I just
really like things that are structured
and the fact it's quite strong are
pockets of military style it's really
really nice so that's big thing we're
gonna end up buying to any cat lovers
yes and the day if I'm going to meetings
and things I wear heels ankle boots so
when I wear flats I always find son
they don't look at Lices yeah kind of
like a healed bootcut look but I always
find these look so full on so nice and
they're so cute
cuz they're velvet and they have a
really nice gold heel as well
but they still manage to give off that
formal look like a heeled ankle boot or
something would plus they're just so so
so cute I've been meaning to buy these
for years and I've always just never
picked them up for some reason I love
them
how do you find them for comfort that's
so Runkle comfortable and I really I
walk like you can tell you like well
bangs like that well yeah there they are
seriously well-loved because they're so
comfy as well yes so next up this really
needs an iron and literally whip this
off of my what's called clotheshorse
thinking this is a new top which again
is been a vlogger thing recently and
it's a top for March and it's just a
completely white and down the front it's
lace with these big frilly lacy bits
down the front
now this isn't usually when I would go
for cuz it's quite boisterous when it's
on so different dust isn't it it's
actually quite understated when it's
home somehow it's just really lovely
flattering shape I like the fact that
the back as well it's almost like a
thicker school burry cotton oh yeah is
almost Jimmy that's really of course
he's really good I'm in but it's also a
real of ly length as well so if you're
wearing high-waisted jeans it just kind
of sits along the very waistband of
high-waisted jeans so it looks quite
nice tapered and really flattering and
really girly yeah Victoria wore this she
weren't like 8 a.m. on the train to
Paris I was like your top yeah oh that's
so nice so this is a recent
coat purchase and I wanting like a plain
black coat that was really warm really
snug had a hood cuz it's always raining
and I always ruin my hair and I like
this one because I had like a little
leather detail on it there's leather
details on the pockets as well and there
are two really roomy pockets if anyone
has the iPhone 6s plus you'll know there
are no
it's that freaking huge so you can get
in big you're getting these ones have a
nice warm hood as well it's really warm
and it comes up like just below your bum
which I find keeps you perfectly
perfectly warm a nice and snug yeah and
I just I love the material with anything
yeah I know I keep talking about Paris
oh this is the only coat I bought to
Paris and the day we were running around
the whole day and at night we dressed up
when we went out and I wore this both
day and night it's quite like her she
looks like one sort of vibe yeah yeah
it's really nice yeah I mean I'm ops
totally obsessed right now I've got
jackets which is why my next one is a
black jacket this was so bad well this
is in sales still oh this is fromage
again like the white top and I got this
in sale and in fact you know what it's
not in sale anymore
it's just online at the half-price ready
I know you supposed to say it's like
it's no longer in sale but it's not the
price it was so it's about 200 pounds
now but I have literally worn this to
death have not I have not seen it sold
to us every Instagram every vlog me I am
in this jacket it's just really nice
it's just quite it's just really
flattering I find for larger coat
because you said that to me didn't you
yeah it's like it you yeah with long
coats especially ones with colours they
kind of make me whenever I try them on
look like that do you like that shape
where it's like Victoria's it just went
like that wow that is such a good yes it
is a really lovely fit that's thing
that's why I really like it formal
jacket that can just smarten up any kind
of outfit but without being overly
formal I could wear the dresses I could
wear it on a casual day with some like
baggy ripped jeans and my converse we
want it to look quite cool so nice but
with my saline bag I mentioned first
I'm loving it it's so so so nice and
