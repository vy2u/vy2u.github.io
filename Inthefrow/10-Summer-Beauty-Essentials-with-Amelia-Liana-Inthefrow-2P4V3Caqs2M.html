pleasure today I've been George by
Amelia you i'm sure you all know her
channel Amelia Jana I'll leave her link
down below and also just filmed three
minute makeup challenge oh so fun so go
and have a look at that video as well
again the link is down below so for this
video we're going to film our top 10
summer UT specials we've gone through
our favorite each parts at the moment
and what I'm going to be using for
summer and what we love the most we have
an action look so I'm just trying to
take a little sneak peek my hammock you
like I'll do you one yeah let's get for
it okay so my first solar beauty central
has to be million-dollar moisturizer
from lush hi how is it you enjoyed this
oh it's so wonderful i only can found it
recently heading to lush tried her by
how lovely is that smell it's so like oh
yeah it's like a coconutty butchery
smell jizo eatin ya go yessss a little
bit absolutely Oliver allah ya know
you're going to look so beautiful though
for creating really Jimmy skin because
I'm not have quite high oil content I'll
say so when you put it on it really
gonna sinks in the lease is ultra GE
glow okay yes a night it's literally
amazing it sounds so good it has SPF 30
and it has SPF 30 which is perfect so I
use it every single morning now without
fail it's like my one only my striper it
just makes your skin glow incredibly
crazy yeah oh my god it smells so good
so good this is something you have
discovered now I love putting I don't
love putting SPF on my face but I feel
like I need data SDF on my face more so
in summer and I always reach like a high
SPF like SPF 50 this is the chanel CC
cream
so it kind of adds like a bit of
coverage like just a tiny bit like if
you're going out and you want to have
like a naked face but you don't want to
wear foundation it like sits perfectly
in the middle but it also has SPF 50
that's really good i think is a really
nice Club it doesn't make you look
sweaty looking glow relay me yeah it's
sinking quite nicely take some really
nice you definitely use your fingers I
feel like it kind of like matches the
product better than skin sounds so
lovely look how pretty the packaging is
no similar kind of product i've recently
picked up is the mac pro longwear
nourishing waterproof foundation I
thought I'd mention it because it is
waterproof did you send this out and I
read there yeah with yogurt state it was
great you know it's great I mean I'll be
honest the day I did wear this it wasn't
overly hard well it was hot but it
wasn't like Sunbeam yeah I place all day
but it did staying like perfect all day
and I got a couple of compliments on it
as well because it made my skin really
flawless and it does yeah I'm so go
every foundation I can never find on the
lake you looked natural but and really
really really would recommend it
especially for anyone that wants
something walk through I have got to
cheat now because I have a three-in-one
but I would like picking these outlaws
at these are my summer favorites by
don't know what color they're basically
these lipsticks from lipstick queen
there that from the end of summer
collection that's super sheer but
they're really glossy but moisturizing
but follow me but oh my gosh and the
colors are like so gorgeous and you can
really build them up this is my favorite
shade it's called Aloha I was like that
LOL jet and then they have this one as
well which is perfect wave that reminds
me of the mac Nikki beautiful yeah
Marcia yeah it's like that this is like
share but you can just kind of like slap
it all anything if you were just like
going out wearing your sunglasses and
just want like a pop of color on your
lips he's it thanks sounds so nice
What's Wrong top again lipsticks I'll go
for my two new favorite is the
the Victorian you'd yet is this your new
I nude I always wonder what real ladies
oh yeah it's like my favorite name to
reach a lot number one sorry got to sing
thats why is that we usually know once I
don't have fun that's cuz I use it every
single day that's a brand new one and it
is literally my favorite food ever they
have tried these don't say this
wonderful or something quite not
well it's a she knowledge yeah it's not
really really opaque but it just out of
sight glistened lips and it's so moist
writing and it is a little bit bar in a
way that they feel like I pigmented bowl
yeah it is yes it is and it's a so
beautiful and also I mean look at the
packaging organized can't get away from
acting that's amazing and then my second
favorite is the mac viva glam miley
cyrus which I've mentioned on the blog
and mentioned it in a few of the videos
I make but if you're after something
really bright and really quite
fluorescent for summer I really like the
using mac lipsticks are great aren't the
only way they always got a great
imitation this one again it's just kind
of like a satin finish I don't just come
up yeah it's like summer in a stick yeah
I think so go for with a neutral eye and
just kind of like a peachy kind of this
it's so bad yeah yeah boom BAM I'm let I
love it have you heard of this no do you
ever burn yeah oh my gosh if anyone
wants to this bugs you need this in your
life it's like this French miracle cream
you can get it tons of pharmacies it's
called BF een it's like a white cream
and it basically is this one's a brand
new one but basically like just- is the
burn it's like a cream to minus whatever
you burn all I cannot just um yeah but
it's like what I never call off the Sun
that gets rid of just the buns so I like
but like knows what my ears sometimes
yeah I do
any to anywhere I don't put some cream
back if i mislike a time you catch it on
like a little round thing of like
redness oh my gooood know this that
takes we're already just take that way
overnight it's amazing really like a
miracle and if it already oh it's all
written in French did you guys in France
them no I bought it and a pharmacy in
Marble Arch called bliss all this
evening but you can get it in front that
sounds incredible ah well I mean this is
secret crush from victoria secret it's
one of their body mist fragrance mist
i'm not too sure if you can still buy in
this particular sin because it's
definitely my favorite but if you're
after something just to spritz on and
just feel really refreshed and like
Brian feeling really really beautiful
and smelling beautiful then these are so
lovely I just often 1000 in holiday with
me I get a shower spritz all over and
it's like a new way of always do people
talk about these and I never know it or
anyone or see one see this one smells
like watermelon nice but yes of course
of peony of peach blossom hmm oh it's
quite a light myth yeah that's really
nice it's a silver source all right I
think it's not that more times what's
the horse with it on the Eternals an
amazing and some of it seeker crush is
the one but if you can't find that all
of the fragrances are just beautiful as
well oh my god it smells like a victoria
secret girl would snuff yeah exactly
handique swanepoel why yes so what a
smell like this okay travel razor okay
basically in the Sun even if I'm like
wax my legs or shave my legs i always
find like that one new hair there's one
yet what is that the Sun brings out its
like the one that got away let's Nick
the razor or the wax or whatever I
always bring this guy with me it took a
look so
little mini razor and instead gillette
venus one and it comes in this little
thing you can just take it away it's
very discreet it's not like a horrible
huge thing along with you and it's just
those little strays to keep keep
everything nice and clean is it really
good as it which the same thing yeah
we're saying it's a bit kind of like
fidgety to use once you get used to this
little squishy thing but I'm helping
that's really good that's adorable and
tell me more products okay first I've
got I've got to I hope that's okay first

favorite products this I probably been
using this product since i was about 12

get the one for body but I use it on my
face because I remember I asked delayed
it now so come what come on my face but
that's a smaller bottle and it's like
the same price yeah where's the body one
she's not only what the Guatemalan you
face as well it's fine so it's about 25
pounds think from these but it lasts you
like all of these will last mate for
like six months to a year well easily
and you put it on your face yeah I'll
put on us no well I'd like to but I'm
just forget so I have to put on about
every three days yeah and you put on for
bed and I just wake up with much like a
healthy Regent globe it doesn't add a
ridiculous tunnel of your face it is
literally slight glow glow in and it
takes away my dark circles a bit it just
makes my complexion look so much oh my
god it's so brilliant it's the only time
I put my face if do you put it on your
body or just your face you can do but I
mean you put on I just put it on my face
