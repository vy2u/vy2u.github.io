things that make me really happy summer
when it's rained all year and you've
been praying for a glimpse of the
sunshine some time to get out with the
house and explore and a pair of shorts
and sandals and your favorite sunglasses
those days when you actually feel warm
without a jacket and your umbrella is
nowhere to be seen
when it puts a smile on everyone's faces
new shoes that feeling when you unwrap
and try on a new pair of heels for the
very first time and they fit to
perfection or when you find an old favor
in your wardrobe and pull them out ready
for day night I'm a self-confessed shoe
addict so for me this is something that
makes me super happy every single time
food brunches specifically but I'd go
for any type of food any time of the day
if I could I'd happily spend everyday
eating avocado on toast in a cute local
cafe with friends or family and I'd be
more than happy coffee when you wake up
in the morning tired hungry and
anticipating the busy day ahead and I
can think about is your morning coffee
something strong something
okay something sweet all mixed together
in my favorite mark endorphins that
amazing the feeling you get on your way
home from the gym you put it off all day
you finally finish your workout session
and your whole body is thanking you for
it or at least it will tomorrow you're
one step closer to your goals and you're
on the right path
that feeling of contented satisfaction
is one of the best discovery that
feeling when you discover something new
your taste buds thank you for like when
I realized I love vanilla iced lattes
what call is the pate our last month
when I tried for the first time and
became teas new biggest fan I know an
English person who doesn't like tea who
am i but not your normal tea of course
peach and lemonade tea of honor from
Starbucks over ice it's just that
refreshing kick I need for any day relax
when I shut off from the day and
actually take time away from social
media for a movement I throw on some
Netflix find my snack of choice and Pat
myself down for an hour or two it's my
favorite way to unwind time for me and
nothing else and that's the way I like
it
flowers filling my home with flowers as
I must for me they make the whole space
so much brighter and colorful and I
really miss them whenever I don't have a
bouquet in the room especially when they
arrive is a spontaneous gift from
someone they're even more special white
peonies and roses are my absolute
favorite
friends when it's been about day or a
good day and all you wanted to share it
with your best friend whether they live
around the corner
in a different city or even on another
continent
they're always there with a smile and
words can pick me back up I live so far
away from all of my friends now but a
phone call or a Skycar can bring them so
much closer comfort at the end of the
day and you can remove all of your
makeup take off your bra freshen up and
put on your comfiest loungewear and the
rest of the night is yours to do
whatever you like no more emails no my
work just a cozy chair cushions and me
time what makes you really happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
