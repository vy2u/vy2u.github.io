talking about fashion and in particular
wardrobe staples basically with the idea
of helping you to build your own
wardrobe of classic staple pieces that
you can wear with everything else in
your wardrobe whether you want to be
casual or more dressed up or whether you
want to kind of pair different things
together hopefully it will help you in
some way so I've gone through my
wardrobe and I picked out twelve pieces
that I think are my staples for my
wardrobe so hopefully they can be the
staples in your wardrobe too however
because twelve items is quite a long
video I've decided to split this into
two videos and have six items in this
one and six items in the following video
so this video is going to show the first
six staple items and stay tuned in a
couple of dings for the next video that
will show the next six staple items
really hope you enjoy this type of video
and let's get started first item is
something that I talked about quite a
lot and I've mentioned it in quite a few
videos and I wear it very very often and
for me it's all about the white shirt
depends what kind of style you want to
go for there are so many different types
of white shirts in the market here are
just a few examples this is wrong from
pazi it's got a drop hem back and it's
got that wing sleeves or I've got this
gorgeous one recently from Hobbes I
actually need to wash it got makeup all
around I mean is it just me that
struggles with that but this is the
cutest little shirt it's quite corrupt
as well it goes to seven different types
of trousers all some I bought in the
past this is one from Topshop quite a
long length little silky material with a
v-neck and no collar and I've also got
one here from a sauces actually inside
out they'll just washed it this is one
from ASOS it's sleeveless the little
collar and a nice soft length to it that
can either be tucked in or tucked out
depend on how you want style it for me
white shirts go with everything they can
go with jeans tucked in or out they can
go with trousers and a tapered or Bhagya
style trousers they can go with short
summer again tucked in I took town I
just look really really cool or you
could wear them over really skinny
fitted jeans or leggings jeggings that
sort of thing and again
can look really sleek and really cute
especially if you out the pair of heels
as well the second item I list has to be
black boots I wear black boots with
absolutely everything whether it be
skinny jeans trousers dresses sort of
long mini dresses or even midi dresses
shorts the go with absolutely everything
so I've got a few different ones I can
show you these are a new pair from
Suzanne Paris really cute love a little
heel on them nothing too high leave my
Alexander Wang boots or the cutout in
the back and the gold the rose gold
hardware I've got some little black
boots from next super easy to wear again
as you can tell the heel size and all
these are pretty much the same I've
gotten up my brand new Chloe boots and
they're very similar to the eyes under
ones but I love them anyway bit of gold
detailing and I've also got a pair
they're a little bit higher as well and
these were from Dorothy Perkins and
again I have worn these to death I love
them for me boots are more comfortable
to wear than shoes because they don't
roll the back my uncles they're super
comfortable to walk around in most days
because the heel is quite a large block
heel so the weight is spread across your
foot much easier to me it's much more
comfortable throughout the day than
wearing a stiletto for example the third
piece for me has to be a black handbag
again black just happens to go with
absolutely everything that you want to
pair it with but it's classic it will
often maintain itself throughout much
longer time period because it's not
going to get it worn and you're not
going to have to see any scratches or
dents are not that as easy as he could
with a colored bag at the moment I have
my new Fendi three shells bag in black
that I'm actually in love with and you
may have also seen me use this Tory
Burch bag and pretty much every single
picture on my blog and a lot of time in
my vlogs and videos as well but there is
so many back to the market you do not
have to buy designer bags to have a good
bag Zara do some of the best bags around
H&amp;amp;M or through some medical bag and of
course Topshop this whistles is Rhys and
cool far he do the most beautiful bags
to getting yourself a black bag will go
with your evening look as well as a
casual daytime look and you can wear it
with everything
the fourth item the list has to be a
white
tshirt I think that a white t-shirt
again can go with shorts trousers jeans
and can be dressed up or down I recently
picked this one up from H&amp;amp;M quite a low
v-neck sort of a wide v-neck with a
little pocket detailing and a really
nice almost textured white cotton fabric
to add a little bit more detail to this
I found I've just worn this so much you
can either make it casual or you can
make it a little bit more classy with a
pair of heels and a cute little bag if
you're after something a bit higher neck
though I also got this yesterday from
Col far he this has been cooked on the
bias which means that the thread runs
diagonally just so it adds a bit more of
a slimmer fit it's got some love little
headlines to it too and longer sleeves
maybe I would wear a t-shirt like this
in summer with a pair of shorts or
around this kind of time then pair of
really skinny jeans or trousers and then
you can dress us up with a pair of nice
court shoes for example a little bag and
a little maybe a leather jacket or denim
jacket through it over the top and it
look really really cute and very
prescient as well so the fifth item the
list and the one you're probably waiting
for is the camel coat this is one I
picked up from Sandro that has a lovely
sheepskin aside it she's beautiful which
desperately needs a dry clean I've also
got a lovely long trench it's in a
lovely camel color this is from hazy on
incredible jacket from Chris little
thing that I wear to death again it's
kind of a more of a topi camel shade and
also I have this gorgeous camel coat
from a misguided I'm sure you placing a
few times I'm just showing Lisa's
examples by the way of different styles
it could go for
however the camel coat will go with most
of your wardrobe it'll go with white
tees it'll go with nice ripped jeans so
go skinny jeans black jeans fitted
trousers just one of those classic
wardrobe staples it's been in everyone's
wardrobe I think for years and years and
years it's always been about the camel
coat and I think it's really sort of
come back again in the past five years
people have been really obsessed with
getting into that classic look and I
especially love it so camel coat has to
be my number five and my number six has
to be the denim jacket I have to here to
show you first of all the Levi's denim
jacket this you can still pick up I
think in stores it's a very kind of
traditional style one but it's fantastic
but if you'd rather go to something a
little bit cheaper and just as good but
I've got this from H&amp;amp;M that I bought a
few years ago that has lasted meet for
years and still fantastic surprisingly
even cheaper than that is a vintage
Levi's denim jacket that I picked up
from a vintage store and this was about
20 pound because it had a little mark on
it that I managed to go out with a bit
bleach so an absolutely love this as
well this is more of an oversize fit
Dillon jacket to that kind of cool piece
in your wardrobe with that again will
really help to casual up an outfit if
you want to wear a particular dress but
you want it to look a little bit more
casual throw a denim jacket and it will
really help to kind of bring everything
together and not make it quite this
elegant sophisticated most of wear don't
jacket with a pair of slim fitted Navy
trousers and some nude heels for example
throwing on a denim jacket again can
make it look really cool and quite a
classic style for me the din jacket is
something that I often go to when I'm
not too sure what other kind of jacket I
want to wear but I want something it's
quite cool quite small and fitted and
nothing too heavy hoping that's inspired
you a little bit as to some new things
you could pick up to kind of help you
build more outfits in your wardrobe but
make sure that you stay tuned in a
couple of days for part two it's going
to have another six staple items as well
that will hopefully help you even more
