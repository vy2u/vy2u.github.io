already filmed part 1 of this video so
you've not already seen it go down
subscription bar and click the link for
first video the whole point of this
little duo series is that I want to talk
about wardrobe staples so for me what
are the classic things you should have
in your wardrobe that will help you
build so many different outfits up and
will stay much more classic for much
longer time we've already talked about
camel coat black bags black boots white
tees white shirts and denim jackets and
now I'm going to move on to the next six
things I think you should have in your
wardrobe - let's get started again 7th
piece for me has to be the ripped skinny
jeans or just the ripped Jean in general
especially this spring/summer ripped
jeans are going to be huge white ripped
jeans or go into massive and I've got
this pair from this guy I did with some
nice rips to the knees distressing and
the cool thing about these is that
they're also cut off at the very ankles
which is very similar to how a few
different brands have done it recently
such as J Brand my most favorite pair at
the moment which I've mentioned a couple
of times recently are my new supertrash
jeans and much more distressed across
the side and also knees and they're
great for turn ups so turn up as well
would be a big big recommendation for me
doesn't mean you can wear so it's quite
cropped you can wear like boots or small
flat shoes or even heels and if you want
to go for extreme distressing 's and
then I've also got these ones from
glamorous that delicious dress all the
way down the leg to the ankles as well
rip jeans can again we dress up our down
pair them with a good pair of nude heels
and turn them up at the bottoms and it
looks really really chic and cool I
should go through much more relaxed
style maybe kind of a festival style
they're perfect and can just look so
relaxed and chilled out viii water of
sable has to be the leather jacket it
can add such a different edge to an
outfit if you wanted to it can make it
look quite sort of rug roll or biker
more grungy if you want it to or it can
make something look really really slick
I have this biker style one this is from
voder skins and a beautiful
all leather it's got some quilting
effects and it's just got a few little
features that makes it look quite biker
and quite cool but if you wear this with
a pair of heels and a lot of pair of
skinny jeans it can just pull the whole
outfit together and just have a bit more
of a cool personality and edge to it if
you're looking for something a little
bit more elegant though I have this one
from Lipsy it's in a waterfall style
some really slim sleeves as well so this
is much more fitted more elegant and
more chic to wear something that's quite
large and full cute like the back jacket
and this is a color I love wearing with
blue jeans especially especially light
blue jeans and ripped jeans it's a brown
leather jacket it's something that I
would never have thought to wear before
but now it looks so cool especially with
blue jeans - beautiful beautiful leather
and it will go with so many things in
your wardrobe number nine has to go to
one my most favorite wardrobe staples
and that is the nude shoe the nude heel
in particular here are two of my most
favorites I have desert Christian
Louboutin 100 pick a leg pump so that
means it's 100 millimeters tall in a
beautiful nude leather patent leather of
course the red sole that's quite beaten
and bruised now and I also recently
bought the Shelby Taurasi corpse in nude
and also white at the front but because
it's white monochrome it'll go with
everything still but generally this is
quite a nude heel the two of these will
go with so many outfits to dress them up
and make them look super chic but again
because of the color because they are
nude they will go with pretty much every
other color of outfit that you have a
little black dress is that piece so you
can pull out of your wardrobe when
you're really not sure what else to wear
for an event you're unsure about the can
of dress code but you know a little
black dress is probably gonna be right
on point so I just got a few here that I
really like this one is from a sauce
with a nice bit beading around the
neckline and it's a nice mini style this
little bot dress is from Topshop with a
nice wide neck some little crop sleeves
and a cute little bit of pump off fit at
the bottom this dress is from oh my love
London and it
and it's got a little bit of
embellishment bleeding around the
neckline cuts away at the side and goes
into a lovely fitted style around the
waist and finally one of my favorites is
this dress is just so stunning this is
from the lipstick and it's got lovely
kind of sequin embellishment along the
edges around the bust and up to the
neckline down the sleeve to count a
dress again that you want to make it
more casual throw on your denim jacket
over the top and put on a pair of boots
there if not pair with your nude heels
and a nice camel coat and you got to go
I couldn't make a wardrobe circles video
with only mentioning one type of dress
so I've also chosen the casual dress is
one of my staples I especially when I
rampage a few months ago where I bought
so many mini dresses to wear with long
opening boots so for me I do have quite
a lot in my wardrobe already but I think
that they can transcend through spring
and summer and through into autumn
winter depending on what kind of
Footwear I'll leg wear you wear with
them I have two here that I particularly
like this one I bought from monkey it's
in a lovely quilted ribbed style a bit
of a thicker fabrics it's quite warm but
I'll be able to wear this so much into
spring and summer because let's be
honest England does not get that hot and
if it does then I'll just wear this on
its own with bare legs and a little pair
of flat shoes but again when I'm not
having one those days I'm like what can
I wear this is so easy just to throw on
and put a nice pair soft black boots
with it but one of my most favorite
casual dresses recently has to be this
one this is from whistles I bought this
on a bit of a win I thought I really
loved it but try it out and I've worn it
probably the most out of everything else
I have worn recently it's just so sort
of classic style all in black you've got
this ribbed
neckline to make it more of a little
turtleneck and it goes down into a MIDI
style quite a long MIDI style so I
definitely think you need to look for a
dress so it's not to doll up and it's
definitely not too casual it's kind of
in between you will to wear it with so
many things and number 12 the left item
on the lift has to be the skinny trouser
whether it's a cigarette trouser whether
it's tapered or whether it's just a
skinny straight leg they go with so many
things in your
I've got a few here to show you I hung
mine up on these little hangers like
this in doubles so here especially these
my most favorite trails at the moment
these are from Reese navy blue super
simple but so cool and classic when you
wear them especially with a pair of
heels they add up perfection or you can
wear them with a pair of flat shoes even
or a pair of boots it's completely up to
you they have quite a nice crop style
but not too long so it just shows a
little bit of sexy ankle underneath
which just can take your trousers from
being too formal just something a little
bit cooler if you have to some color
though I would recommend going for
something that's quite muted in tone and
can still be worn with quite neutral
shades so these dusty pink trousers are
quite a good option I think and they
also have another pair from Hobbes that
I've just not taken off recently if you
see my Instagram you'll seen these so
many times on my Instagram and it's this
pair from hops so these are more of a
pattern which of course will go out
style much easier than the plain colors
but there's something quite nice about
them for spring these go beautifully
with little flat slipper shoes white
plimsolls with them you could wear a
pair of colored shoes for example I've
got a pair of rose gold slippers like
pointy slip shoes from Nicholas Kirkwood
that go beautifully with these and in
the same way you could wear them with
some beautiful nude heels to dress them
up so that was it
all six items and therefore twelve items
