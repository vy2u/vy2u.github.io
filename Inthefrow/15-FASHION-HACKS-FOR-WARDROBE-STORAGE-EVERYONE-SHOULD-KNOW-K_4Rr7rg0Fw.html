buy a lot of bags a lot of shoes and a
lot of clothes I don't really know where
exactly to store them all I thought I
kind of share a few of my favorite tips
of view of how I store all of my things
maybe your boyfriend's I'm gonna go at
you that your flat for total tip maybe
you've got backs everywhere and
everything this looks super untidy
I definitely got to that point and I
needed a really good way to store
everything to protect everything and
keep everything really really nice and
tidy so I thought show you all of my
different ways I store my clothes bags
and shoes okay let's start with a super
duper easy one the size of your hangers
muscley massively matters I bought so
many of these think you know these are
so pretty when actually they take up so
much room because of how thick they are
and when they're all stored back-to-back
on one row you finally going to get like
10 codes or something
they look really but they're not that
functional whereas these guys they might
not look quite as good but they're so
super thin you can get so many of these
on one rail especially if you're hanging
upon your t-shirts and glasses these are
a godsend plus with this kind of
Velveteen fabric and use all your
dresses don't slide off also where
you'll pay maybe 12 pound for five of
these for these you can get like thirty
about fiver okay one of the best space
savers I have found is double handing
your clothes so say if you have a really
large jumper and a really large coat and
you like to wear them a lot hang them
together so for example hang your jumper
Whitney favorite coat it massively faves
and you can pull it out remember your
favor outfit straight away so it means
you can almost like create a curated
wardrobe of all your favored outfit and
spaces at the same time one of the best
things I ever ever did for my wardrobe
was genre rising and categorizing my
different types of clothes so for
example up here I have my dresses down
here I have my tops shirts blouses and
also tiny bit gym wear and in here I've
got all of my coats long dresses per day
like day wear dresses down here I've got
trousers long trousers
jeans jumpers shorter jacket and then
what kind of like boucle jackets at the
very end so I found that one best ways
to hang my dresses especially seeing as
I only have this section to hang them in
I don't have a full-length wardrobe and
if you don't either this might help you
so I started to kind of fold hang my
dresses on the hangers so example a
dress like this beautiful dress like
this it'll get creased and all worn and
tatty at the bottom if it's in this kind
of wardrobe so I like to hang my dresses
and then pull up the very bottoms neatly
and tuck them in over here that means
they'll stay proof 3 they're not going
to get tatted the bar and they're not
going to get dirty and they fit nice and
neatly in the wardrobe there's a general
rule of thumb what I do with my clothes
is that I make sure everything that I
love and that I'm wearing a lot is
hunger I always for so long kept trying
to fold away items keep them all super
neat and tidy it never ever works and I
found out wasn't wearing anything that I
really really liked or stored away and I
wouldn't be able to see it so I made a
change I made sure of everything that
I'm wearing and really really love is
inside the wardrobes I can see it I can
take out and wear it whenever I like
things that wear anywhere near as much I
can fold away and when it comes to
folding make sure you choose certain
types of Clippers as well that are
better to be folded so the dark crease
and they're better for storage purposes
so for example in here I have my shorts
and skirts shorts are generally made of
you look at denim materials are not that
easily crucible materials so they're
pretty good to fall away so in here I
have all of my denim shorts all folded I
can easily see them but all together and
then I'm going to take up heaps of room
inside of a wardrobe here I have denim
then I have my more cotton fell shorts
below those I have my skirt again all
neatly folded down and then over here I
have a lava
lay off skirts it's kind of the skits
and shorts fold a jaw and it's keeps
everything super neat and tidy if you're
anything like me and you like to buy a
lot of jeans and hold your jeans for
years you might have quite an extensive
collection so I found one of the best
ways to store my jeans with actually to
hang them up especially in different
types of jeans dials so for example I
keep all of my wife and lyta calls
together I keep my ripped darker jeans
together and I've also got my mid blue
non ripped jeans that I want hang out I
have my leather trousers I have my
palazzo trousers hunger I have my
ordinary trails for hunger but the
reason this works is just because one
day when I want to wear a pair of ripped
dark jeans I can go straight to that
exact hunger and finally that pet I need
the best thing I ever found for brow
storage rather than throwing all of your
brows into like your knicker drawer and
it's being a complete and utter mess
wants to place them in one little drawer
like this so I started place them
back-to-back so all the cups sit inside
each other keeps them nice and tidy it
also protects them because I know that
we always like to buy maybe the of
expensive bra that keeps them so much
nicer plus you can actually see what
browser you want to wear on the day you
want to wear them rather than rooting
through not meant to find your favorite
bra they're literally all lined up super
easy to find when it comes to shoes this
is the first super easy one but make
sure to always keep the filling in the
shoes so easy to get a new pair of shoes
throw it all the Box all the fillings
and to stop store shoes away and then it
gets to a point where you going on
holiday or maybe everything has got a
bit jumbled and all your shoes getting
laid on top of each other so if you make
sure you keep all the fillings inside
the shoes ensures you stay there perfect
condition for as long as physically
possible you don't do spending so much
money on shoes and then find that they
lose all of their shape because you
didn't keep the filling so they come to
kind of storing the shoes and I know
that if you've got lots of different
types of shoes like me maybe flex it a
lot over the years you might not have
quite enough space to store them all on
one shelf for example so I found that
storing them back-to-back
really helped save us a little bit extra
space so for example one shoe this way
one shoe the other way
- this way Anshu the way watch it this
way on show you the way I can get three
sets of shoes on the shelf if I place
them all like this I'd get two sets of
shoes on this shelf just tiny bit of
space saver and the same thing with two
letõs if you've got a lot of stilettos
they can take up a lot of room so I've
found that placing them kind of in rows
next to each other front and back on top
of each that works so well so for
example once you at the back and then
place the other one inside with the heel
in front of it just you've got one two
three four five shoes on a row they're
not ruining each other the heels are
safely supported and sadly the shoe it's
not causing any holes or damage but make
sure it's where you can see all of your
shoes nice and neat like I mentioned
with clothing I find the best way to
find my shoes and the ones on aware
particular day it's just to categorize
and drawn our eyes my shoe collection as
well so if example in here I have all of
my different types of boots at the top
heel boots larger heel boots I've got my
Dior boots in a section and again very
pointed toe heel boots and in this one
is a little bit more messy it's still
watching it but again I have everything
categorized so a lot of sandals I'm not
that bothered about getting my sandals
more kind of dirty they're all together
I know I always take them I'm holding it
than the sand anyway so they're all good
then here I have my kind of taller ankle
length stiletto style shoes I've got
mules here I've got kind of heeled
sandals and then all below I have my
stiletto collection and a few boots and
trainers and then on to my by collection
and the best thing I ever did with my
bags would buy this unit so I could make
sure all my bags with sat side by side
even if you're not got space for you
know you've not got anything like this
just having somewhere to store your bags
side by side makes such a massive
difference it means I can see them all
they're not getting damaged they are
safe and secure they're not being
squashed you know this kept really nice
and you can see each and every bag and
the cool that you want to take out on
the day super easily when it comes to
storing bags I know a lot of people like
to store in different ways and a lot of
people also like to keep their
in their dust bags just to make sure
they don't get any dust on them the
don't get damaged that's totally fine
but for me I like to see my bags so I
can kind of get more inspiration as to
what might go with my outfit so instead
of storing my bags inside the dust bag
instead I put the dust bag inside of my
bags so for example with this Chanel
travel bag this is stuffed full of my
dust bags
it just means this bag is then keeping
its shape so much better it's also a
good place to keep the dust bags they
don't go missing you've got lots of bags
you've got millions of dust bags just go
everywhere so keep them all in one place
and it just means you keep a beautiful
shape to your bags at all times and that
also means that when you're maybe going
away or you need to pack your bags for
some reason you already have just bags
ready to go ready to pack away and the
left tip when it comes to bags
to keep them all nice and tidy and just
look in their absolute best I find the
best way to store them is to make sure
all the straps are inside the bag so
rather than having your bag tucked
inside it all straps everywhere way go
for each and every one of your bags just
take the strap pack it inside and store
it away and that is it those are my best
hacks or tips when it comes to how I
store my bags shoes and clothes I said
so many of you have asked me so I really
hope it kind of helps you when it comes
to your own clothing dilemmas let me
