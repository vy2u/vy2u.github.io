sauce party where Christmas looks and
outfits video I love to film this videos
annually so I wanted to bring you guys
18 different outfits and looks page with
my own bags paired with my own shoes
show you how I would wear them how I
would style them hopefully there'll be
some things in here that you absolutely
love right so let's get straight into it
with luck number one this look I
absolutely love this black this pink
I've put this gorgeous jumpsuit with
these really pretty pearl embellishments
all over it with some pink accessories
I've got my Manolos I've got this
gorgeous little sage or berry pink bag
you can dress it however you like you'll
have black shoes you could go with
silver shoes pink shoes red shoes but I
thought it'd add a little bit more color
to this full black outfit but the pearls
and the gorgeous mesh oversized sleeves
just make this such a gorgeous elegant
sophisticated outfit I love it I think
this outfit is one for the girl who's
going either
out maybe to a house party out out for
drinks with the girls or even just to a
Christmas pie with the Stars and the
meshwork it's very elegant and cutesy
but I have just thrown on an overly
paranoid and then just put a white
excess ring with it as well but overall
I love this whole look I just feel
really pretty and really key also very
Christmassy so this jumpers who could
look quite simple black and plain but if
you match it with some lovely shiny
silver accessories I think it makes it a
little bit more Christmassy so I've put
on some lovely silver earrings silver
bag and so shoes just to kind of match
everything together but the frill detail
around the cuffs of the legs on these
just make it a little bit more fun a
little bit more fancy and perfect for
most occasions
okay this is like the rogue choice this
is for the girl who doesn't really like
getting dressed up in the Christmas
style but still wants to look quite
pretty and wear a dress this feels kind
of quite summery but I feel like if you
put it with the right accessories you
can make it look a little bit more
festive so I've put some gold
accessories with this gold bag
and gold shoes big gold hoops I don't
have any it was a big gold hoops and you
put gold jewelry on you know make your
eyes super festive but I think it works
wonderfully but I wanted to leave it in
because I love this dress and I think
with over knee boots it could look
amazing as well this alpha is a little
bit more bold and colorful for the
person who likes to wear trousers
especially I work from very bright an
exciting option with these gorgeous
purple very wide trousers and then to
make it even more festive I have gone
for this very pretty cropped black with
this silver threading through it so it
looks really really festive and
Christmasy paired that with some pink
accessories but you could go for full
black accessories if you want to be a
little bit more pared down but I thought
the pink looked quite lovely with it but
overall I think it's a lovely bright and
fun outfit okay I think I found a
favorite so far this is so lovely and
fitted it's obviously got the trouser
section into the jumpsuit and it's
gorgeous sparkly embellished top piece
I'm not wearing a bra and I feel super
lovely and secure in this high net it's
just very elegant very fitted but still
quite sexy
I just thrown on some nude accessories
just to keep it quite sophisticated but
overall I think this is such a gorgeous
outfit you could wear it to so many
different types of events this dress is
super embellished it's really given me
like bow man vibes lots of beadwork
going on the strong shoulders a very
strong fall silhouette overall I'd
recommend sizing down with this dress it
definitely would've needed a size
slightly smaller but I think if you've
got incredible boobs and great legs and
you want to show them off this is a
great night club night outfit or like
fancy drinks out fare thing and I'm just
paired it with some ova new boots again
for the very balm on vibes and a little
black back Sochi but this dress is a
little bit more alternative but I quite
like it some are very cute
very pretty about it very feminine but
it's got stars and it's makes a little
bit more festive and cutesy again
perfect like a date night or much more
of a kind of like club night night out
I'd say I've paired it with some sock
boots just for a little bit more of an
edgy style and also another little black
bag that has some star details on it to
go with the whole theme but I think it's
so cute it's such a cute little outfit
and a little bit different I'm sure
everyone loves a little red dress and
this is a gorgeous white raspberry rich
raspberry cherry shade it's so pretty
so lacy and fitted and Alex really nice
funk teeth I love it I think it I just
feel really confident in that I feel
really pretty quite sexy and I'm just
paired it with a little touching about a
bag just with all the red colors and
then some little baby pink shoes as well
as support all the colors together but I
think it looks really really cute so
this is a really elegant sophisticated
choice the kind of thing you'd wear if
you've got to really fancy kind of
Christmas ball or big fancy dinner
something a little bit more occasion
where it's really gorgeous it's a full
maxi on me just skims the floor so
they're quite easy to walk in as well
feels really fitted bit lacy and again
because all Navy with a little bit of
black legs work you can pair it with any
kind of color you like so I've gone for
silver accessories II could go for gold
if you like to maybe some big earrings
as well
I just put silver shoes with it and fill
the back so I say this is for the girl
who wants to look a little bit more sexy
body car and bearish minutes very
Christmassy but also just I don't have
something very flattering and very girly
and gorgeous I actually feel a little
bit like Kim Kardashian vibes in this
but it fits really really nicely there's
a little in Christmasy quite festive I
was paired up some nude and cream
accessories I'm a huge huge fan of dress
it's got real like disco vibes with the
fabric and the colors and this
patterning but it's got this purple
green gold black it's just very very
cool very kind of Christmasy festive and
also quite sexy you've got slit in the
leg it's got these cutouts on the side
it's high neck it's very kind of me if
I'm going out might be a bit more kind
of sexy and fun and really really loved
it and I just paired it with some quite
nude neutral accessories but I'm a big
big big fan of this for me this is like
the perfect New Year's Eve dress you
know it's got the stars it's got a bit
of sparkle but it's still quite sexy and
really pretty like I feel really
confident in this dress I paired it with
a little black bag with gold to match
the gold on the dress and just some cute
little black stiletto sandals as well
but overall it just fits really nicely
it just feels comfortable but he just
looks sexy and pretty I think I feel
like this is such a good choice it's so
sparkly and embellished so really quite
festive but it's still fitted and it's
quite nice mini length without being too
sure I feel really confident in this I
feel
secured on health in quite sexy at the
same time I've got my legs out got a
look with pair of stilettos on and just
paired a little silver bag with this as
well doesn't match the more silvery
embellishments but overall like I feel
really lovely in this dress perfect for
New Year's Eve Christmas Day any events
that you've got going on
another more colorful option at this
time are more kind of true red I
actually will love it I love how fitted
it is it feels really kind of fluttering
a little bit sexy but without being a
little bit too much I like the fact that
it's kind of high neck and then comes
down very kind of fitted and then into
this more efficient a Lascar but the
laces keeps it quite feminine and fluid
really really pretty and again I just
added some neutral accessories to it I
really love the shape so such a
sophisticated kind of feel to it I
almost feel like it's the kind of thing
you'd be wearing to work and you slip on
your little silver shoes and go out with
it I really really like it it's really
fitting and flattering again nice low
back and then the gorgeous satin bow
just around the neck this makes it a
little bit more festive I'm really
really feminine I feel really confident
in there a beautiful lace detail over
the bosses is really really pretty and
then yeah like I said some silver
accessories or black silver accessories
works really nicely with this dress but
it's just a little bit more elegant and
put together a bit more classic
if you're after something really
embellished again I think this is a
gorgeous gorgeous choice it fits
beautifully I love this much you knit
kind of shape to it almost like chain
mail vibe to the way that the
embellishment is put together
it also has quite a blue tone as well as
like a silvery blue so it's a little bit
different I love the fit I love the
length of it I feel really comfortable I
think it's a really really beautiful
choice I've just paired it with a silver
bag and also some little black shoes but
again it could go for silver shoes or
even blue shoes so I'd say this is for
the girl who doesn't want to wear black
to a Christmas event it's a really
pretty like baby pink jumpsuit so it's
quite comfortable I mean with a good
iron it would look even better than this
but I'm just kind of wrapped it round
with a bow into the back so it pulled a
knife and tie it makes it really
flattering
I'm just paired it with a darker pair of
pink shoes and again added this little
bag with the red and the white just kind
of pour
color together buttocks is quite
comfortable it's not overly festive we
can make it little bit more festive with
your accessories and this one just has a
little bit more color more peplum shape
very fitted so kind of things that if
you're gonna meet a lot of things and
maybe would have recommend it it's very
much like figure hugging the same time
very flattering with the length and a
little bit of peplum and it's very
straight with the gorgeous straps shape
to it I really really like it overall I
love this very Movil light pink that
it's got to it so I've paired it with
some little baby pink Manolo Blahniks
and also a white bag it's kind of make
it very neutral and very pretty and cute
but overall it's really gorgeous dressed
I think it would suit so many different
body types and that if it guys 18
