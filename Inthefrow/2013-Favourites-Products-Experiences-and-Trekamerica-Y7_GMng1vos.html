years of my life so far out doubt I've
done so many things this year so many
amazing things I've achieved and it's
just been amazing so I thought I would
just do a bit of a 2013 you run down the
products that I loved some of the
general experience that I had and just
some other general things that were
favorites of that year so let's go start
off with a favorite than most people
really name is one of their favorites of
this year and it's the laura mercier
sort cream foundation I use this
recently in a makeup video in beige
ivory but I also have it in cream ivory
which is a little bit lighter and often
I mix the two together to get the
perfect shade but I have been tanning a
lot recently so that my body is a bit
darker so I've been stopped darkening up
my face a little bit so the beige ivory
isn't perfect it's flawless coverage it
is absolutely beautiful on the skin it
just makes you look incredible and I
could not recommend it any more talking
of that tanning the best tanning product
of the year has to be the Zen tan rock
and tan I've mentioned it before in in a
favorites video I think and I just
cannot fault this it it doesn't streak
it's really sort of beautiful dark all
of your color and you put it on I need
to put it on before bed wash it off in
the morning it washes off all the excess
product and less leaves it with whatever
has been pigmented into the skin
it's just absolutely stunning it's about
20 pounds a bottle 22 pounds a bottle
you can probably get about 5 full bodies
maybe six full bodies out of this so
it's a lot cheaper than going to the
salon and getting a spray tan and it's
not too bad of the smelliness so this
it's just a product I cannot live
without and I often have about two or
three bottles backed up in my drawer for
one anything favorite moisturizer same
as last year actually is the regen cream
again a product I cannot fault it is
incredible forgetting rid of any
blemishes any problems on your skin and
because this is obviously a bit of a bio
oil Joop so it's meant to be for
scarring or for blemishes or for dry
skin and scarring so it just takes all
that away then a couple
so absolutely amazing publishes so and
about for pound at all but from like the
best place to get its Aldi for about
three pounds fifty we can also get an
Amazon for about six pound and it is
amazing I would say my favorite powder
product of the year has got to be
hourglass I've only had this about two
months so but still it is by far the
best at pad product I've got this is
ethereal light which is a very lightest
powder and it's absolutely beautiful on
it just blurs out any imperfections it
sets the makeup perfectly I use a sort
of concealer and down my t-zone to make
sure everything sits in place and it is
wonderful it's about 35 pounds I think
about 35 36 pound but highly worth it
and this will put it last me a couple
years so amazing favorite palette of the
year I've got a few different palettes
but I would have to go with my naked
basics mainly because I use every single
day as my eyebrow color I like to use
for to lighter brown or darker Browns
cuts of black so two Browns I use a
mixture of for my eyebrows if I'm also
taking this away with me I'll use the
lighter colors as eyeshadows or as
eyebrow bone colors and it's just
fantastic palette for 20 pounds so
that's M Decay Naked basics bronzer has
got to be NASA bronzer like everyone
else and I've hit pan on this and I'll
have to buy it again soon I will be
buying it again soon because it's just
the best color obviously quite a deep
color but you can kind of build up apply
it lightly I use it as a contour shade
and all over my face is getting lovely
bronze look and a little bit of shimmer
in it not too nothing too much but it's
absolutely fantastic
and this is around 26 pounds I think
amazing product favorite eyeliner has
got to be the ICO liquid skinny liner I
found this about four or five months ago
and I've never looked back this
beautiful tiny
felt-tip pen kind of nib makes it so
easy to draw on the perfect cat eye
Steve Paul day it doesn't start to flake
off it comes off quite easily with I
makeup remover and it's just fantastic
so easy cheese and it's about tenner I
think one of these so brilliant product
favorite lip liner of the year and it's
gonna put a special shout-out to this
because that's adore it now it's the mac
cherry liner again we're not had this
very long but I'm already absolutely
obsessed with it I've got it on now move
a bit of a night off liner and another
lipstick which I'll show you in a second
but it's just the girls are so beautiful
a it's an absolutely stunning shade of
red cherry red and it will pretty much
go with every single red lips that
you've got I'm sure so that's an
investment definitely lipstick in
question is the Lime Crime poison very
lipstick which again I use in a recent
video I've got it on now and I
absolutely adore it for the perfect
purple dark lip it's absolutely stunning
I'm crime is an American brand but you
can get it over here
I think there's somewhere called
cocktail cosmetics shop coat at UK
something that sells these and they're
about 10 to 12 pound per lipstick but
they are in the Opaques range so like an
opaque lipstick that goes on with full
full color it it kind of safe spot all
day you miss you to non-drinking it'll
come off but it'll leave almost like a
stain on the lip see so that was kind of
a purple berry shade I just apply some
more afternoon drink but there's no
lipstick that always found that but it's
just absolutely beautiful and I
absolutely adored out like now the hard
a needle it for a while and that is
usually my go-to but when I do have a
nude lip this is where I go to the Mac
creme Cup I know a lot of people love
this shade as well but it's just a
beautiful nude pinky nude it goes on
beautifully it doesn't dry lips out if
save poor fur for whenever you need it
for until you obviously you're drinking
and it's just stunning and I think these
around 15 pounds from that lipstick now
favorite lip balm what's run the lip
front is calyx
I couldn't live without this now
generally this is my desert island
product and it's just really really
great and making my lips feel so much
better than they were before and perhaps
them for
lipstick every time I wear lipstick I
always have this on first before better
wear this now I put with balance feeling
much so much better and pretty much it's
only thing that takes away chapped lips
within an hour nothing else really err
but does that say amazing you for a
brush of the air again I've got to give
a shout out to this because I absolutely
adore it
it's the Mac 207 the best brush ever for
eyeshadows I will apply a full eye
shadow
coating with this one brush generally
the sweep off any anything you've got on
for the first color go in the next color
it's just a perfect blending brush it
applies beautifully it blends
beautifully it doesn't apply too much
product or too little product it's just
perfect
there was a week or two where I learnt
this to a friend accidentally and it
took me two weeks to get back and in
that time I just could barely apply my
eyeshadow anymore because I had to use
all the brushes I just didn't enjoy
using and I just realized how much I
adored this brush so much thinking about
another one and I think wonderful might
show you some of the dark shades I might
be ridiculous but that's one thing
you're doing and I hair product I
absolute could not look without now is
the Moroccan oil this is the one for
light colored hair it is almost finished
now unfortunately I will be buying
another one this is about 12 pound per
for a small bottle and it's about 30
pounds for one that's about twice the
size it's a lot of money but it does
wonders for her it keeps head of such
good condition my I apply it to my ends
after I've washed them before I dry them
and my hands are so silky smooth if a
bleached hair my hair is in really great
condition and I owe it to things like
these hair oils there are other ones out
there obviously that do a really good
job as well but an absolute doll and
Moroccan oil and I found it's just it's
a bit more viscous and a bit more luxury
on the hair so it really feels as though
it's really getting into the hair so
this is fantastic and highly highly
recommended ok so that's all the beauty
products still obviously I've got a
couple more that I could mention but I'm
going to keep it short this week and so
on to some other little bits and bobs I
would say the best thing about here on
the best things about is he
we sat in June I think it's gene I was
given the personal style blog reward
from company magazine I won against so
many fantastic blogs and it's still a
moment I'm so so proud of and still
can't actually believe happened but
thank you so much to everyone who
supports my blog it's in the fro calm I
have so many people who support me which
is absolutely amazing and to have only
been blogging for six months at that
time and to win with just the best
achievement ever and I still can't quite
believe it so thank you again to
everyone for that second of all the
second biggest thing to happen to me to
you as I went traveling I went all
around America from New York back to New
York 360 degrees all the way around the
edge of America North America and it was
just one of the most life-changing
life-affirming holidays ever if you're
thinking of doing a trek America tour do
not hesitate to do it I mean at the
moment that got like 20% off I got often
you can get 10% off deals and student
discounts and things like that but I did
the trail later tour which was 62 days
New York to New York and it was just
incredible I can't even tell you how
good it was the things I saw that you
would never really ever see unless you
went with a real tour leader and you had
that kind of time that we had because we
camped from place to place now and again
we've got hotels like Vegas we've got
Hotel Miami in places like that but all
the places we just camped and so many
people said to me like you're not gonna
be on to camp like you won't be able to
camp for 60 of days like no no I'm
absolutely fine and I must say I was one
of the people at Mon the least about the
camping I actually loved just being
outdoors not having loads of things with
me to worry about and just being with
friends like I made join 20 amazing
friends on the first trips of 13 of us
14 of us with a tour guide and then in
the second half a few people got off the
bus and people got on the boss so
overall I'm at 20 incredible people
and a lot of them majority probably lost
15 si I still speak to on a very regular
basis and a lot of friends for life
hopefully so I cannot recommend enough
if you want to do a tour of America and
your thing you'd recommend
do not hesitate anymore just go for it
go on your own meet new people have new
experiences and you will not regret it
it's money well spent and another matter
thing to happen this year I'll see was

the career ladder now and I just
finished a PhD in mobile commerce design
