hair tutorial video so this was inspired
by a recent trip to Paris Fashion Week
that I had with L'Oreal Paris amazing
the blogpost on this already or even the
vlog that I put together I'll leave
links down below to those who want to go
have a look but I was taken along with
L'Oreal Paris to a few different shows
we saw John Galliano jump Yusuf Ali and
also Maison rabbi Cayuse on this video
is just very much inspired by the
different hairstyles I saw it those
shows got a chance to go backstage and
see all the different L'Oreal stylists
and what they were using all of which
were a combination of lots of the new
L'Oreal studio Pro products I dunno if
you've seen these already
I am on set I think I've mentioned this
a few times already how obsessed I am
the whole packaging it just looks really
premium so these little a brand new into
stores recently their full pound 49 per
product which i think is an incredible
price point for how much you get and for
such a brilliant product as well I'll be
using these in a minute so you can see
so for example these are the boost it
range this is the volume mousse and this
it's a volume hairspray this is just for
that extra hold extra volume then you've
got the curve it moves such is perfect
if you really want that very cool beachy
the natural cool waves there's also the
sleek it which is an ultra smoothing
cream and it's also got 230 degrees heat
protection its uses to finish it runs
through the hair and create a much
muscle leek style and then there's also
a locket range which is a series of
different hair sprays and varying
strengths so you've got the ultra strong
five strong three or extra strong four
I'm gonna use a couple of these for show
you how to use and how I would use them
yeah hopefully recreate someone looks
that I saw on the catwalk so yeah let's
get the first look I'm gonna go for with
from the John Galliano show and it was
for a really cool slicked back low
ponytail really really sleek that way
I'm just going to brush through my hair
so it's a bit more sleek and flick now I
remember looking at the girls on the
catwalk for the show in Paris and they
didn't look like they'd have their hair
really straightened and what's it like
super duper slick for me I have quite
straight hair anyway
so I'm not going to straighten it myself
I'm just kind of I'm gonna leave it as
it is but enhance it I'm gonna start off
with a sleek it ultra sneaking cream a
little touch of this onto my fingertips
I'm just gonna run that through like I
don't want too much in my hands I'm just
using it to kind of tame any flyaways or
any hairs I might look a bit messy at it
through a bit at the top here by the way
this is gonna be my interpretation of
leaves looks some of them I know a bit
of what products exactly that they used
but I'm just gonna do it in the way I
would do it for you guys or how you
could wear it in a more natural way as
well I'm going to use the locket fixing
hairspray in the strong number three
make this wrap I want to really slip
and then I'm just gonna having my
partner's office on it but I'm just
gonna kind of work this part and back
this is really nice it's quite workable
as well because it's number three in the
strong it's not like extreme whole that
I can't now play around with my hair in
this I would say use one of the baubles
with the hooks that are very kind of
professionally used well it's their
piece and we go all the way around when
you hook the two ends together that's
the way to get an extremely slicked back
perfect look but I want to kind of do
this for you guys and what you're gonna
have at home so an ala bubble will do
just try and make sure that use of
hairspray to kind of help you get the
ultra slick look gonna use a little bit
more off the sleek it and run this
through the pony just remove any
flyaways well I'm so I'm looking down at
this at this mirror down here look
number one move now to the second look
in a suit this is actually from London
Fashion Week but it's a look I really
really liked and L'Oreal created his
hair so thought it would be perfect for
this tutorial this was from the Julie
McDonald show and it was with models a
centre parted and a very loose way if
you take out this sleek pony now I'm not
usually one for centre partings happy
honest I don't think they suit me very
much but I'm going to try it the safe of
this look okay I'm sure that we'll do
like out for this one we're gonna go
from very very loose beachy waves and so
I figured I'd try the curved it curl
mousse this would be better if my hair
was wet and I could kind of dry it into
it I know that the way that they did
this for Jimmy McDonald was it they kind
of wet the hair they put
curved into there and then they use a
diffuser a hairdryer diffuser to create
more natural waves and then they use
their hands to really kind of curve all
different pieces however my hair isn't
wet and I want it to be quite usable
tutorial I'm going to do it in a
different way in the way but I I would
do it now in fact that creates such a
lovely beachy style anyway we like that
I'm gonna do is we're going to use a
curling iron just to go through this and
create some very very loose waves too
many sections so just the top and the
bottom in it so it's going around the
top now at this point pop some hair
protection spray we've already got some
of the sleek it going through the hair
so and that has change in flash degrees
heat protection take a nice messy piece
don't brush it through keep it messy we
don't want this to be perfect here guys
take this piece I'm gonna open up the
tongue on my hair curlers cool okay and
then I'm just going to kind of run the
clip up and down let this out I'm just
gonna hold the hair I can pull it out a
bit cuz we really want these to be loose
we don't want them to be tight curls you
can do it sort of forwards I can do it
backwards through here so you can go
over from forwards or backwards if you
wish and I would recommend doing a bit
of both sorry I'm like give them a big
mirror there and I'm like I can't see
this properly also I'm leaving a little
bit at the end almost a little bit of a
straight bit quite quite like that look
and it looked like that's the way the
model said it does not like it was
killed or way to the end I'm gonna carry
onto the rest of my hair then I'll come
back to you when I'm gonna do the top
okay
here in the back I'm gonna wrap these
just save getting the kinks and when you
get to the front of your hair go put the
one behind and work backwards curls away
from your face
okay there we go I'm just going to go a
little bit more off here then we want
the weight and the body here kind of
middlings these I've been messing with
it and playing with it for so long it'll
have this really a really great texture
to it
we don't want slick we want it to look
like this flyaways and that is it
look number two to really love this look
it's so messy and it was so easy to
achieve love it now
look three is one from the jean beatty
strip family show which is where I saw
Gigi had it backstage to clean up models
and that was amazing to go back
seriously it's just a really great way
of seeing all the products in action and
how I could potentially use it so
because I was there and I was watching a
guy do it on one of the models I kind of
know what they were doing so what they
did it was security look very similar to
this but they were much more kind of
perfected sleek waves so I'm just gonna
take some more of a sleek it and
obviously create something similar to
this but make sure you brush through the
pieces before you do it so they're a bit
more beautiful and they're not so messed
messed up like these I'm just going to
sleek it to run through these I just
perfected curls they're much more sleek
and slicked down now let me work this
one it was all in the parting and the
way I did it was it was extremely slick
back and all on the back was curling and
back like this but with the top slicked
back so this requires a lot of be stitch
that's for sure first of all gonna use a
bit the Beast it volume mousse music to
run back
okay and then I need the boost it has
break because this is one holding
jamaats for sure it's about keeping the
hair all really pushed back and slicked
back
I think the key with this one is that
you don't worry about putting on too
much hairspray you just do it so you
don't want it to look like it's Plus
into your head the way they were doing
it is it's almost meant to look like
you've been in the sea and you've formed
your hair back and you rather go through
it and it's wet and it's slicked it just
looks really cool that's the trick and
that is a look so it's super slip back
wet look but with a bit for combed feel
to it you're not almost look like it's
got some KO marks in there and then that
goes back into a really cool pretty
style that is it for look number three
this is a very kind of red-carpet look I
think anyone could achieve this
remember this sounds really big about 18
months ago a year to 18 months ago I saw
loads of people didn't the whole
slicked-back thing and I've never done
it so I'm actually really glad that I've
given this a whirl and the more and more
practice about the better I get at it
but I've never really seen anyone do the
whole kind of curl in a more straight
style that's all three looks which was
your favorite let me know down the
comments and if you recreate any of
these looks make sure that you tag me on
Instagram they were to hash tag in the
fro so I can have a look through and see
