location this is the Godfrey hotel in
Boston I've seen here for a few days
with my mom my stepdad
and obviously Alex and we're having a
bit of a kind of break away thought we'd
go away together not going a holiday my
mom for a long time and also Virgin
holidays of help just kind of set this
whole thing up so it helped us work out
where stay what canif like to get and
all that so big thank you to version
holidays as well as well as the Godfrey
hotel for letting us stay it's really
really nice it so I wanted to film
something freshly from Boston I figured
I kind of talked to you about my Boston
outfit so it's a little bit like what I
film for the mall days like a wide
packed video so I'm gonna get right into
it I've got four different outfits that
I've worn for each of the days that
we've been here and that actually really
really looking about fit so you may have
already seen this on Instagram but I'm
going to tell you all about them anyway
first outfit included the incredible
little Fendi bag you may see this in the
net of port a whole little Potter haul
so it's got the two little sides the
door but get back it's super cute floral
autumnal with these beautiful colors and
it just look gorgeous because all the
leaves in Boston Common
we're just a little bit obsessive bus
and commenting on it I also brought with
me the stunning wreath both hair color
and the blush Rose style it sounds like
a really fern felt wall it's absolutely
beautiful long length
I felt really regal and sophisticated
and elegant in this jacket it's just
such a gorgeous piece beautiful and with
that bag the color to say to the rust is
so cute I also obviously brought with me
my nutria Sally boots I'm a little
obsessed with these boots the most
incredible color I've never had boots in
this color before I always go for black
because you know but these are just so
wearable been wearing them non-stop on a
set got so much bear at least already
for such a large heel I can spend quite
a lot of hours in these trudging around
everywhere so I've just patrician around
Boston for quite some time in these
total of them and again with all the
colors in the soft pinks and the
burgundy of the bag it was just perfect
with those I was insanely cozy beautiful
knitwear from NP
this is one of their cashmere pieces
they specialize in cashmere and it's
absolutely still in cashmere and the
cable knit on this is so beautiful and
intricate I don't even know what kind of
a knit this is it's dawning it's
absolutely beautiful but it's felt super
cozy and lovely in this it's beautiful
materials it's absolutely stunning so if
you're after something a bit more kind
of luxurious cashmere honestly have a
look at em peel because their products
are just beautiful so wall that with
that and then on my legs theiry me just
a kind of statement pair of black
leather trousers but the cool thing
about these that they're love on the
front and then they're like a jean
material on the back so for anyone that
sort of struggles to get leather
trousers to fit their bum properly these
are such a good option because it just
means that your whole bomb just looks a
lot more flattering like jean style but
in the front is like super cool leather
style so these are from Reese really
comfortable I wanted fashion we totally
love them and this is a really great
piece to have in your wardrobe to be
honest so that made your outfit one okay
outfit too so day two I went around this
insane new bag this is the Bulgari surf
and Tosh bag I have the 70 forever bag
the beautiful dark sapphire blue with
the patent leather which is just
beautiful and this is brand-new from
Bulgari in a pretty short she's next
season's but they let me bring it along
with me because I really want to take
some beautiful photographs of it and
it's just the most incredible bag so
I've got it super early and it's in the
Python skin I think this gorgeous almost
mosaic patterns snakeskin feel all over
the bag and also housed the stunning
step and chain as well that comes with
it if I can show you that it's that
perfect length of strap so you can wear
it crossbody or you can just wear it
over your shoulder and sometimes I like
to hold it as well it's so beautiful
so I want that with the other reefs
jacket of my dreams which is this
ceiling aviator black ceiling aviator in
fact I've worn is twice I'll show you
how I wore in another outfit as well and
this is just some more stunning fabric
and bits a longer length it's super warm
it's kept me so warm over this holiday
and I've had
compliments on it love that chopping it
to bits as well as the bag my other
favorite thing about this outfit while
the boots so there's a fee to russy's I
kept these from an exporter or because I
was so obsessed with these for so long
and they're so comfortable I've worn
this a couple of times now especially
out for like dinner stuff on these a lot
for going out for dinners and boss
eventually they're just that piece
everyone kind of looks at your leg and
girls like wow they are killer boots are
incredible love those and with those I
wore another piece from NPL this is a
Kashmir mulberry scarf it's a stunning
mulberry wine shade gorgeous material
again it's supposed to be a full
beautiful Kashmir super stuffed and just
have a little bit more color and it also
went along perfectly with the colors in
the back so that was such a cute little
choice together and then the main part
of the outfit top-seed cover me up was
this CDC cream jump dress I got this
from evolve actually I'm not sure what
brand it is but of course all links will
be down below for everything that I've
shown you here but it's just a fleecy
jumper dress I'm not really had anything
like this before and more of a few easy
cozy fabric so it's super cozy it's
really nice to wear it's really quite
warm and I just Wallace with the over
knee boots which just skimmed topsis
really great length for them and yes
just feel the national Kosak so that
made up outfit number two
okay so outfit number three on our third
day I wore it with the gorgeous family
on bag so the beautiful embellished
crystals are all over this super
statement on a phagosome in a compliment
gorgeous smooth black leather and this
makes a big statement beautiful piece
the other accessory I wore with Vance
were these boots these are from Kirk
gaya just a really easy shorter style
boot I'm pulling away knees home on a
plane just to kind of get my feet a bit
of a rest from all these heels
I like she brought three pairs of heels
with main heel boots three pairs I did
bring any flats and I can't live
regretting it now a little bit at least
with the beautiful black ordinary suede
just really easy simple to wear but this
little bit of a color to the heel
that little pop of something extra with
those I wore a new pair of boots and
jeans personal one my favorite jeans
brands just a really lovely material
they fit me really well I always go for
the 25 I believe you have 25 mid-rise
and yeah these are the mini rise Nico
style they have one full leg with over
stitching here and then to the other
knee is a cut knee here and I'll get
another bit stitching so it's not
completely rittany it's just one route
knee just add a little bit more detail
well it's really comfortable fit really
nicely and the final piece which is just
so simple and I actually have makeup all
over this now I'm gonna wash it again
it's another piece from evolve and it's
a beautiful chunky knit in gray you know
I'm not obsessive he's chunky knit too
on that things and this one was calling
out my name absolutely loved it this is
a really cozy piece so as well so that
makes up outfit number three and finally
alphadon before I got to wear my dear
Rama bag obviously the perfect autumnal
shades and I brought this with me as
kind of my honor plain handbag so I have
to get wearing it I love this bag and
with that I wore another piece of knit
printer this is the Tommy Hilfiger and
Gigi Hadid collaboration range that they
put together and it's the little crop
from that range so it's in a really
gorgeous cream it's so super chunky like
megachimp key this is I've said this
before it's almost a bit of a neck brace
feel good so chunky but it just adds
that very wintery or Tom not feel to the
whole outfit it's still big and chunky
so I wore that felt very warm indeed in
fact it wasn't a really hot day in
Boston so it might not been the best
choice but I made it work and then I
just threw this burberry scarf around my
neck because I really wanted to wear
another scarf this trip and I haven't
worn this since last winter so on to get
this out and it's the one that I have
monogrammed with VCM so this makes a
little bit more special I think I just
still think you can go wrong with every
scarf I feel it's like statement piece
in anyone's wardrobe bill it's it's just
beautiful fabric and the last piece that
went with that was this little skirt now
this I'll be honest I don't think you
can buy this any mile this was from
River Island and it's on their suede
pieces they're more premium pieces and I
pull this out my wardrobe because I
thought it would look so cute paired
with the big chunky net but what I've
done is I've looked all over the market
for things that quite similar and I'll
leave you loads of links down below to
lots of different high street looks your
options to get something quite so much
this because it's just a really great
piece in your wardrobe in fact I think I
had two of these because I loved it so
much I knew I'd get a lot of wear out of
it so I'm not getting too real of this
piece so I'll leave some options down
below for you and with that whole outfit
I just wore this resada boots again
because with the colors and the mulberry
scarf it just looked really quite tonal
was beautiful autumnal colors so that
made up the fourth outfit and the only
piece I didn't get to wear in this whole
trip that I've hacked was my bad man
sweater so the bomb answer to that wore
in my last video and I showed you the
neti pot at home that's why don't you
say nothing Potter enough to Porter Hall
it's the only thing I brought with me
that I didn't get to wear which I'm not
a bit good about both syllabus I think I
might wear this home on the plane so
that if everything that I brought with
me and packed for Boston there's the
four outfits that I wore let me know if
you like this kind of style like talking
you through the outfit so or he'll put
them together why and just generally
what I packed for my trip I really
enjoyed actually filming it was really
good fun this whole trip it's been
really amazing actually just like
spending time with my mom and Alex and
it's exploring a city we haven't been
seen much of before I have been to
Boston before but not really seen as
much as a half this time so I've really
explored it it's been amazing like so so
Berlin so again thank you to burgeon for
setting this all up for me and to
Godfrey for having us it's been really
really good fun and thank you so much
