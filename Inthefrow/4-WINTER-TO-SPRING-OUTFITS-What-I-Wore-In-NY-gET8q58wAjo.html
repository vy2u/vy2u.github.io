back this is going to be a bit of a New
York Fashion Week run-through there are
few pieces in my wardrobe that I wore to
New York Fashion Week and I kind of want
to show them to you so if we could have
show you what I wore for each different
outfit on different days and can I do it
that way
so let's get right into it I've got some
beautiful new pieces that can't wait to
show you
you've probably seen these already on
Instagram by so I could give you a
little bit more information about them
and show you a little bit more about
each product so let's start off with
what I wore kind of first day if you do
follow me on Instagram and throw you
will have seen that our plane was
cancelled to New York instead of snow so
we had an extra day in LA to kind of
spend some time and chill so technically
my first New York Fashion Week outfit
was actually worn in LA which was kind
of good commitment that I was still
quite warm and toasty in what I was
wearing just because it's so nice in LA
so the first thing that I wore is this
amazing coat from Bali so I kind of
built the whole outfit around this I
want this to be the focal point and I
think pink is huge the season I really
want to do like a pink lookbook soon
yeah I think it is a massive trend for
the season especially if you wear it in
jacket form it's such an easy way to
going to throw it on with your usual
casual style and just inject that little
bit of color and this is the most
gorgeous pastel baby pink it's
absolutely stunning and the quality is
magnificent as which we're wearing this
around la I got so many compliments of
four random strangers although what pass
and clip stuff perhaps a beautiful goes
down into quite long lengths quiet kind
of in between a million and MIDI lengths
really with this jacket it just meant
that with this I could weapons and super
casual and it just looked denote really
cool and with a stylish so that was the
first thing I wore just because that was
such a statement I wore it with this
white you're seeing this in my eighth
overall as you've seen it already so
it's just a white body super use it's
got makeup on this now and is really
good clean it's a sleeveless which is
perfect for the weather at the time
because the coat kind of kept me nice
and warm plus it was already nice long
as the Sun and it just took it straight
in to my jeans which again I bought in
my eighth alcohol and I love these so I
kept the
and I kept the body and there were
leaves together and they just looked up
now they really flattered legs becomes a
very elongated shape just a bit
distressing to the knees to add a little
bit more detail and color is gorgeous
and it's just my very usual kind of star
like white tea blue jeans can of style
but they worked really really well with
the coat and then for a bag I went with
this little Sally bag it sort of kind of
like a crackle painted black leather
pocket at the back and it's on a chopper
so opened up and then you've got the
chain strap and silver hardware she's
super cute and in the picture you'll see
that I was wearing that kind of holding
it I also had it on as a crossbody for
most of the day as well but because the
pink was so pink and vibrant and has
white and blue in there I thought the
black would just be a nice kind of
contrasting shade to go with all and the
final piece was the shoes and I went
with these amazing gym shoes again as
one a few times and instagrams like
always get so many compliments on them
they are insane that almost is such a
brilliant boot for the season you could
wear them with socks if you want to but
generally because we have these holes in
the front you can see the skin down the
front of your foot I was purchasing up
quite a long waiting on a leg as well
but with this high ankle again it's just
very long waiting very flattering and
you know super stylish really feminine
up so I love these boots
so that was outfit one all of that two
pieces
so outfit two which I think might be my
favorite now I'm so upset with how dirty
these are I was walking through New York
and snow and sleet and they've got a bit
messed up I'm sure they will clean up
perfectly and they altered a little bit
battered in my suitcase full of silk in
amazing
so these cars are boots which you've
seen a few times now absolutely love
these because not wait to wear them and
again have so many compliments on them
New York Times fashion featured them on
their Instagram when I was wearing them
yeah and it just really enhanced this
whole outfit so I wore that with this
gray jumper dress still loving jumper
dresses and this one has a really lovely
neck which I just left and let it kind
of hang it become quite loose along the
Cowley but you can just tie it into the
central double bit like this one wearing
I don't often not wear these but it's a
really great length Clin it was really
nice and warm and yet I felt think it's
really quite flattering especially as I
paired it with my belt now this you can
no longer buy and when it's set with the
coach Bell I bought it last season I
absolutely love it I got it in Chicago
actually it's got these beautiful
details on the buckles and all the way
around the belt actually stunning I'll
try not small turn to fit felt for you
down below and find anything similar
I will definitely show you but what I
did was because most belts obviously in
a waist lock for a hip belt it fits
really well around my hips but not so
much your on my waist so I just went
into a key clip it's often do belts and
things like that and have gotten to put
some holes in it for me so now I can run
through the waist belt and as a hip belt
so I wore this with the dress and just
kind of stitched and pulled it in made
it even more flattering and also the
detail with the kind of silver and
silver boots was also quite nice I mean
like that so that's a nice little tip
for into spring just kind of pulling
things in making things little bit more
flattering it has worked really really
nicely now I don't have them here but I
also wore tights for this outfit I never
wear tights it kind of my northern route
I got so used to the cold back when I
was younger and in the north
I don't generally wear tights I just I
find my legs don't get that cold and
also I'm just not the biggest fan of
tights I think it kind of ruins all
cashews I feel like shoes with bare legs
always look beautiful but on this
occasion I actually found some types of
like stop it I'm so cold I was going to
go in it but I really like the way it
looks actually it with the silver it was
quite a nice contrast that did kind of
work well so that's what I wore and then
I wore it with this gorgeous jacket I
don't think I've shown you this yet I
got this from All Saints it's a really
deep dark navy it's got a black trim
around the collar and I always pop my
collar anyway this is one of those
colors that stays constantly off and
part which is even more my style I love
that it doesn't very lightweight coats
not super thick it from was very
lightweight almost cardigan makes a coat
style it's got one button to bring it
the center to pockets and goes down
again into a
kind of mini mini meets MIDI links that
kind of longer scale coat you'll see it
on the picture but again this is worked
really well with the colors I was going
for conserve and navy black scene I know
a lot of people don't like to wear blue
with black but I don't understand that I
really like blue with black I think it
works really really well especially
quite dark shades so yeah that leaf
looked really nice without the apps it
loved it the final piece faster on with
that was just beautiful Jimmy to lock it
back in the mini size in pink super
pretty and do lots of in types of these
and these are smooth leather that you
crack a leather I think this is just in
the baby pink I can't seem to find a
link for this anywhere so I'll leave you
a link down below for once very similar
but this looks so cute and the thing
that's really nice about this well first
of all is this Navy buckle that opens it
beautiful needle beeping it's on my
favorite shades together and then the
strap on this is beautiful all the
locket bags have this detailing in the
strap which almost like it's been tied
like super nonchalant tying it just
looks great so when you can have a non
crossbody the sleeves is almost like a
little broke your mouth little bitty
brooch of the chain so I love that so
much but this extra bit of pink and a
touch of color to a very monochrome dark
outfit and especially now with the
silver it just kind of added those pops
so I thinking is my favorite outfit that
I wore in the week well let me know
especially only video let me know down
in the comments which with your favorite
outfit I really like to know okay so my
third outfit that war was very very deep
cheap kind of ask and it was almost
based around this little skirt and I saw
this online so completely in off of it
it's not the most inexpensive skirt on
the market officers because it's Gucci
but I'll try to find some alternatives
to get a link down below if I can find
any but I'm just so into the style like
Mideast weird boots are over knee boots
as you know that's why I love jumper
dress too
and I wanted something that's a bit more
statement and this gorgeous waistband is
kind of skate all the boxes for me
beautiful big goals it but the back it
is fit to really beautifully on so this
is a victory absolutely love it so I
wore this and with that can either
something was sort of match and it's
this and it's almost more cream ribbed
body well it's not a body it's a
turtleneck I look through all
turtlenecks for all four of my outfits
but you know me all slightly different
them so this one is a ribbed turtle that
into some bash Vash I'm pretty sure you
say it as bash but it's just a really
nice quality actually it's lovely
quality material and it was the perfect
shade really solve like lemony creams
that works really well with the skirt
yes look really cute together so all
those I also warm it with this cute
little Foley Foley bag that I got just
because I wanted to add a touch of red
and I have this with me I thought it was
just perfect little accessory this is
about 160 pounds so it's much more
affordable than my elbows my other bags
in my collection but it was really
really sweet and it's got all these
lovely gold details to it this is
gorgeous so it is clasps it reminds me
very much after Chloe drew bags in the
kind of look at the sky love it
somewhat expression of kind of mind a
little bit it just looks super cute this
outfit so that was the accessory and for
the jacket actually is before just my
Gucci jacket of course it went perfectly
with the beauty skirt and this is extra
in terms of this scoop she kind of
captioning ribbon effect around all the
edges I love this jacket so much one as
I can tell me how my compliments I've
had OS Jackie I think every time I wear
it and must have about five plus
compliments of different people and it
just makes me feel so happy absolutely
love this jacket fit so beautiful
investment piece that I will own for you
so that was a jacket and finally the
boots of course they made an appearance
nice too oh my goodness and they look
great see I'm wearing some sweet in the
snow and all this front bit got
completely wet and dirty if my short
move I mean you can try and still see a
little bit but I think I think that so
far and I thought they'd be much worse
so I got to wear them I really wanted to
early from New York Fashion Week the
color is just beautiful stunning fabric
and answer I've worn these suggest I can
know so many people ask me and they
really worth it you really get your
money's worth out of them because about
600 pound boots and honestly I bought
both of my pairs and have used them so
much I could not recommend them more
they are so comfortable I could do a
whole they walk in these they don't feel
that hacks I mean
only quite a small hill anyway I would
say it's a beautiful pair of boots that
I can't recommend the more seriously
such a good investment and you'll wear
them all year because they're not too
too hot or warm self yes love those
and the final outfit that I wore
consisted of mainly this All Saints
dress and what happens is I which is
picked all these things out of my
suitcase to film us for your services
little bitty guinea pig lady so this
also strap which I thought was very very
many houses cooked out detailing in the
shoulder can see that goes up into a
high neck it is very black so I'm
showing you my other things and then
sleeve and then down into it's like a
jumper dress this with a bit of twist so
again I wanna seeee with the belts or
cinch it in otherwise it just drapes a
lot and it looks great but I feel like I
want it to be a bit more flattering and
more pulled in so that's what I did so I
pulled that all in together like the Hat
I wore it with this beautiful Jimmy Choo
locket in the large size I thought it'd
be absolutely stunning this is such a
beautiful kind of crackled leather
effect
Jimmy sure you lock it bag it's an
absolute view it's got a long strap but
I just generally wore it like this
because it went really well with the
jacket which is it this one actually
wall is my season and that play loved
this jacket to pieces it's a perfect
camel jacket it's so thick more I'm so
glad I'm actually out breasts colleges
around now you said to pick up this coat
yeah I took it with me finding out
Fashion Week's I knew it was gonna be
cold so it's such a good coats that it's
really really closely born beautiful
walls together got load of confidence on
this because you can't really beat a
camel Jackie I don't think really long
and it just pulled the whole outfit
together with the colors the black in
the beige and the brown and in the final
piece with these now how different these
for me but I actually really really like
them these are a pair from all things
and when I saw them it really reminds me
of the louboutin boots that you seeing
everywhere I mean the Louboutins are a
little bit of a slightly less chunky to
you a little bit higher a little bit
taller than the ankle but kind of very
similar features that that's all causing
the lace-ups and the black patent kind
of style and these are obviously much
more affordable that Vanilla's come one
so but
you really liked a bit more grunty
before on judging it while masculine
style for me and yeah it's a big change
of six and lotsa little heels like this
to something that's a bit more kind of
chunky clunky their B's were great
firing actually and real like these and
again it went well black and having the
Browse together put site worked really
really well
so that was it another kind of a lot of
new things in my wardrobe as well so I
really hope you liked the way I did this
to kind of showed you the new things in
the way I wore them with some stitches
and all that so do let me know in the
