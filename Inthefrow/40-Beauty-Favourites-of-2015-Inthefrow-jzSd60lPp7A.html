review video it's a really nice way to
recap back through a really cool year a
lot of different products and talk about
the ones I really really loved which
ones have really stood the test of time
over this year as you know I'm a beauty
blogger as well as a fashion blogger and
therefore I have used a lot of products
this year from a lot of different brands
from luxury to low-end and I feel I've
kind of got to grips with what I've
really loved for me personally so this
video is going to be a roundup of all
the products I'm really really loved I
feel like it's the featured in this
video they were pretty down special so
I've gone through my bathroom and my
office collecting products I'm just
gonna pull them out and go through let's
get started first of all with skincare
so first things first favorite eye
makeup mover off the year is v she's
pure thermal waterproof eye makeup
remover it removes waterproof eye makeup
better than anything else apart from
maybe Chanel's but this is a more
affordable version on the high street
and it just just a trick so well
favorite cleanser this was difficult I
have so many cleansers right now it was
a little extreme however straight away a
lot times this one I was like yeah you
want for me Yves lom's
creme cleanser this is just one bad-boy
the cleanser I love how oily it is it's
kind of an oily gel cream it's almost
feels a little almost slightly gritty
when you put it on I just find and smell
so spa-like it's just beautiful and it
just melts down your makeup better than
anything else and then I also I add that
all over my face and then I use this
which is my favorite two of the year
which is the foreo cleanser to the tough
one because I do also really door the
Clarisonic but this one I find it's a
little less abrasive more everyday use
for me I use it twice a day without fail
I just don't feel right if I haven't
exfoliated if I haven't cleanser this
I'd still feel alright
looks nice yeah so the foreo definitely
my favorite couldn't live without it
with the Elan is a winner they return
the year I've used many this is the one
I went back to the most last year
I definitely have some new ones recently
I've been using more than this but I
feel over off an entire year this was
the best for me it would see some play
one hour time this is the in fact things
just in one color yeah now it says here
use it for three hours to get a dark tan
I would use it overnight at a cover my
body in it
put my tanning onesie on get in bed
sleep in it wake up wash myself the next
day so people had like eight hours now I
knew ten how I've seen it but I'd love
the time it gave yeah it's a good
favorite hand cream of the year has to
be this one from hand chemistry this is
the 24 person active complex extreme
hydration concentrate I love the fact
this is almost like a gel gel cream it's
completely clear and transparent when
you put it on but it has that almost
silicone feeling it just feels like it's
adding it's a bit like if you've ever
used benefits Porefessional primer it
feels a bit like that but for your hands
it's really soft and smooth and silky it
makes your hands feel incredible it's
extra intense and moisturizing and it's
really beautiful so that even my faith
or moisturizer night moisturizer
specifically the Lancome Visionnaire
nuit beauty sleep Perfector oh my god I
love this very soon I'll be doing a
nighttime skincare routine video because
I want to tell you all about my
nighttime routine because I'm just so in
love with it right now it's just my best
routine I've ever had I feel very very
happy with it
and this is part of that and this is
beautiful I was shown this power on the
girls at L'Oreal cuz I'm common film by
L'Oreal this is wonderful it's just this
kind of like bouncy gel kind of feeling
like you've got a kind of almost scoop
of it to get it out and it's just it
just melts into the skin I love it I
love it it's beautiful
favorite parfum of the year overall it's
got a bit of fun this is my favorite
every single year Viktor and Rolf
Flowerbomb extreme all the comes in a 50
mil size and for that it's about 70 or
pound this is one price little perfume
but alright truly adore it's like my
signature scent but I also want to
mention one other that hasn't been a
signature scent before but it's
definitely one that I
the most and it's a ton for Kosta Azera
anything's that any of the kind of
special private blends the Tom Ford do
are just extremely stunning to smell but
this one I feel it's just absolutely
beautiful
no there's just something somewhat
masculine about it but yeah it has these
feminine notes it's so alluring it's
absolutely in this bag okay
oh my gosh by far my favorite ever dry
shampoo this stuff changed my life when
I found out about it about three four
months ago this is just so fantastic I
hate using dry shampoos that when you
put them in your hair you literally
cannot put your hands through your hair
because it's just this matted ropes mess
hate that so much and this is one of the
things that I've found that doesn't do
that it's really light it's a pillar
proof blow-dry to date extender oil
absorbing dry shampoo but it's really
really liked I just put it through it
kind of pick up sections spray it
through I can still put my hands through
my hair rub it through it doesn't leave
any kind of white bits or white mess any
all of your hair it's really amazing I
just can't love this anymore for hair
volumizing I love putting mooses in my
hair after I have washed them so I dried
them I will use a mousse and I put a big
bowl full of mousse in my hands ribbon
together turn my hair upside down and
rub it through and this has become my
one and only it's a red can got 10
volume spray foam and you can to spray
it into your hair if you want to fair
enough but like I said I dove still
spray it into my hand room together
I'm rub it through and I found it gives
a lot of volume I use a surly it's still
quite volumize I've washed it and I've
curled it it smells lovely it's sound
quality it's good am i my favorite hair
oil as always is the Moroccan oil
treatment I know that some people don't
like this because they say it coats your
hair I don't care if it cuts your hair
it coats my my ends nicely and that's
all I kind of care about
as long as it's kind of making my hair
look shinier and feel better but then
I'm a lot happier to be honest there are
other things that I love using like red
can have a fantastic oil that I also use
this is the one if my hair is just
feeling like crap this is the one I'll
go to and I've put a ten pm out into my
hands from it together and I'll rub it
through all of the ends before dryer and
it just makes my hair feel so much
better
so yeah I can't live without that
another one for hair which has always
been a favorite place for the past five
years
it's a GHD kill hole spray before
curling my hair this is only thing I use
it's got heat protectant inside it
almost acts as a curling helper so it
must have agents inside it must have
chemicals inside it that when you add
heat to it almost starts to help form
the hair almost a bit like hairspray it
kind of helps to kill this form I will
spread this through each section my hair
like I did today
spray it through each section curled it
and I know it's got the heat protectant
in it and it's also gonna help hold
these curls now for a few days it's
honestly a secret weapon ever since I
found there so I fell in love with it
and I think I found this about three
years ago when I first started blogging
and I've never looked back I think the
last one in hair my favorite brush
tangle teezer
can't take me away from the tangle
teezer it is the best I've got so many
of these lying around the house this
one's got so much hair it is zombies
they really help to volumize my hair I
find they don't make it static they
don't take it out as much hair as other
brushes do on my hair it's a winner
favorite eye palette lorac Pro - it was
a toughy I have the lorac mega Pro -
I've got the rat Pro - and I've got the
rat Pro one and lorac Pro one it's also
insanely good but I find this one is the
one I go to the most especially for more
glam nighttime locks
I've hit pan um - which of my face the
rose gold and the champagne the rest of
colors are just absolutely stunning
pigmentation the blend ability of these
shadows is second to none this so
brilliant and yeah if you are in the UK
you can get this
from Nordstrom online I'll leave a link
down below and they do shipping to the
UK it's about 15 pounds shipping but
this is definitely worth it I promise
you favorite face palette if you know me
well you will know I've you see
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette
now pretty much a lot of the year and I
loved it
however I deliberated over this before
and I realized it has to be won by the
lorac Pro contour palette for a few
reasons
this one has shades in it that are a
little bit better for my particular skin
tone and I feel for a lot of other skin
terms - the first thing it houses a
highlighter which the other one didn't
really have and it certainly wasn't this
pigmented or beautiful on the skin so
highlight is amazing this shade here I
find it's a wonderful bronzer for me so
anyway I've got highlights I've got
bronzer these two I use as my powder
shades and whilst they're very similar
to the Anastasia Beverly Hills banana
powder contour pan these to take away
shine I'm so much better than the other
one I found Anastasia was wonderful it
just to take out as much shine as I
wanted and these really do help to
mattify without clogging the face so
those two and then this contour shade is
just wonderful and if I really want to
have if I'm more time and I want to
really darken up my contour I'll go with
this one so I find that everything in
this palette gets used and it has a
mirror and the honestly so I'm didn't so
for that reason well Sam loves the other
palette this one as soon as I got it
completely trumped it it just it has
everything that I can use whereas the
other the other palette had like one or
two that I used out six I use all of
these I'm sorry a BH lorac wins in this
time I also wanted to mention one other
face palette which is more of a bronzing
blush palette rather than the face so
it's not cheating and it's this one from
hourglass which I've used to death
through it's the hourglass ambient
lighting powder palette
the shades and this is stunning I have
to new this the highlight mix of this
one and this one is a highlighting
bronzer and I find on the days when I
just want to add glow and depth to my
face this is so beautiful I just use a
brush work it through work it through my
contours and around like a bronzer and
it's just a really beautiful palette and
I used it so much I couldn't not mention
it but then my favorite bronzer most
definitely is the bronze goddess by
Estee Lauder huge pan easy to sleep you
brush into it's got a mirror I always
use this mirror when I go traveling and
I'm on the road whatever and I'm not got
a mirror with me this is the thing I
pull out my makeup bag to do my makeup
with so it's super handy beautiful color
of bronze nothing too glitzy glam it's
also not mapped either so for me it's a
wonderful wonderful bronzer favorite
face moisturizer you all knew this gonna
happen it's a million dollar my strata
from lush this is like a gold cream and
when you put it on it just helps to
illuminate the skin it has so much doing
this that when you put your foundation
over it the skin to still gleams but
nothing else I've ever used most people
and user since summer so they look super
doing summer I use this all year round
because who doesn't want to be glowy in
the winter too I do
favorite eye lashes branded the air it's
gotta be this one for mosquito their
lashes are just for easy step and to put
on I like the packaging is quite
packaged I've got the cute little card
inside the eyelashes these especially oh
so sweet I've been my favorite oh so
sweet by sido I just cut them down a
little bit but they're just more natural
what's also being enhancing they go on
much better than any other lashes I find
and with that my favorite lash glue is
also by sceeto it's a companion long
lasting bond
I just find the fact that this is a wand
you can add it along the edge of your
eyelashes so much easier than using any
of the other types of glue so these two
together by far my favorite eyelashes
favorite lip balm of the year I have two
because one is incredible but I've
recently started using the past two
months which I have to mention and the
other one is a long-standing one as you
all know the by Terry Baume De Rose is a
good'n
ladies Rosie babe this one is the just
original light color but they're so
hydrating they really help to plump up
my lips they add a really beautiful
Sheen to it I find his nice lipstick
they're fantastic but I also like to
mention the lip glow by Dior because
this really rocked my world when I got
it
the idea with this is that you put it on
it's a bit like the blush the Dior glow
blush in that you put it on and it
reacts to your skin temperatures so it
can turn any kind of color but this on
me I find just as a lovely light pink
sheen which is exactly what I want on my
lips because I hate my normal lip color
and I like them to be lightened flight
Li but still look rosy and this really
did it for me a bit like how rows are
babe did so those two without a doubt my
favorite lip balms favorite foundation
this was a tough one it took me a couple
minutes to come up with this one but I
think the one that I preferred the most
for the perfect shade for me the right
consistency on my skin it stayed on my
skin the longest and made me feel more
glam or more affected was this one it's
the make up for ever ultra HD foundation
granted I only use it for the past two
and a half months or so to the end of
the year but it really round me and it
made me feel so much more confident when
I had it on the shade this is shade to
3/5 I think it's just a really brilliant
shade for me so I found my favorite
favorite eye brow product has to be the
eyebrow maestro from shershow Armani
this is in the shade number 2 Wedgwood
and it's a dark brown a really dark
brown but as you know I like my dad
rounds I've got it on now I still like
the consistency was perfect for me
it wasn't too waxy our Sun can be little
bit too waxy and totally ruin your
brushes this one is a great mixture of
color and wax and it was stayed on my
eyebrows all day and was a perfect color
for what I wanted so have to be that one
favorite mascara of the year no guesses
what this is going to be it's the
Clarins truly waterproof mascara nothing
holds a curl of my lashes more than this
mascara it's all I need to say it's
wonderful I just go hand in hand with
our killers which of the Shu Uemura
eyelash curlers I'm just going to say
this one last time because I say it all
the time if you are like me and have
lashes that point downwards straight get
yourself a good pair of curlers like
these curl your lashes fill they're
perfect exactly how you want them to
look then use a clown's truly waterproof
or the Lancome doll eyes waterproof
mascara and gently brush them through
and your fan your lashes stay all day in
that exact perfect position better no
other favorite blush of the year I've
got many many but there's one that I
always go to back to especially for more
glam looks or when I'm going out I know
it's perfect for my skin tone and it's a
Charlotte Tilbury cheap to chic first
love so this is a lighter shade of blush
that they do it's a very light movie
pink nude shade and when I first bought
this I honestly thought it's not been
gonna show up in my skin tone why am i
buying this but do you really want to
give it a go give it a try
and I was totally wowed by it it's
perfect my skin tone a very light nude
pink beige flush beautiful favorite
highlight of the year has to be this one
from Becca it's a Jaclyn hill I'm pretty
sure that most people will say this this
year but I think as soon as we all found
this all the beauty bloggers or anyone
that was into beauty or anyone YouTube
who loved this I think everyone realizes
just how often whilst the pigmentation
just makes us cheeks shine like the Sun
like nothing else it's so gorgeous and
you can also get this now in the UK
really easily I'll leave a link down
below so you HOT for this well get into
the bottom now guys get into the bottom
concealers so - I've got to mention one
isn't technically a concealer Celsus
from first and it's a Mac prep and prime
it's more of a an eye brightening pen
and I just use it in the way that Kim
Kardashian would usually use it in the
triangular shape underneath my eyes and
then I'll Pat it in and it just
brightens and also it conceals very very
slightly the point isn't to conceal it's
to brighten and illuminate so I use that
first and then my favorite concealer
must have to be the Mac I think Pro
Longwear concealer it's one I've used
for years and it's one I trust with all
my heart but make sure you set
after you've used it because otherwise
it picks up products on your face but
I've got a few shades and this this one
at the moment it's NC 15 and it's very
brightening under the eyes whilst also
it's got a really great coverage by a
heavy coverage but it isn't cakey so it
will clear up all manner of under-eye
bags but won't be too cakey subscribe
for the best favorite eyeliner has got
to be this from Tom Ford the Tom Ford
eyeliner
double ended one Stein in their want
along it along in it with my favorite
cuz it just really sweeps on it's a jet
black color unless your eyes water and
wheat big-time like mine do sometimes
this is not going to come off it really
is great for staying power I just find
it's super easy to use and it's a
wonderful pair next up is lip products
favorite liners okay I've got a few here
my submit to I can't choose between
because I've used them both so often and
I use them interchangeably really and
its Max or Mac world they were the two
shades this year that you could not get
your hands on for so long that was even
last year it could have been but these
were the it colors because Kylie Jenner
said she's there are more people
thought that she use these so I got them
both well is more of a beige tone nude
saw has more pink in it but I have used
these to death as my nude lip color i
line my lips with these almost a little
bit over lining them so little bit
bigger and I'll fill them in with a nude
and I find that that's a really great
nude lip for me and then lipsticks I
know the wife's l PR quite well Holly
she's lovely and I love the fact that
she's almost coined this lipstick as
Victoria's nude and it's a why sell nude
number one Rouge Phillips it's a light
nudey pink and I've worn this so many
times I think this is play my fourth one
this year plus the packaging is just
absolutely beautiful and I just love the
fact that she actually calls this
Victorian in the Victorian nude because
I wear it so much I love this shade but
if I'm not wearing this quite often I'm
wearing this which is the Tom Ford nude
4-nil number 12 which is a very similar
if not more nude it's a little more nude
this one has a little bit more pink to
it but I always have these in my makeup
purse in my handbag for every single day
this is the one I go to from definitely
want to go really really nude this one
helps to brighten up my skin a little
bit cuz it's got a bit more pink and for
lip gloss
I don't wear lipgloss very very often
and therefore when I came across this
lip gloss I was totally blown away and
in love with it
by Guerlain and it's one of their
limited edition I think the losses gloss
DNF are and it's part of their Christmas
collection so pretty sure you might
still be able to get this especially on
counters but I just love the consistency
of this the fact that it's not too it's
not sticky it's not sticky at all and
such a brightening gloss to the lips
with these little particles of glitter
and it's just stunning I mean look at
that packaging beautiful so I have to
mention that last but not least our
tools my tool of choice yes this means a
clean I'm gonna cleanse all my brushes
right after this Real Techniques sponge
it's also brilliant but if I had to
choose between them I'd go for the
beautiful under this is a beige Beauty
Blender by the way they usually paint
both of the beige wrong the fact that
the nib is a little bit small are really
allows you to get into the creases of
your eyes better and around the edges if
you nose ever since I found the Beauty
Blender my makeup has not been the same
it's just been ten times better than it
ever was because it just allows you to
really push in your makeup and make it
perfected and it's all down to this
little guy but in brushes I have four
favorites that when I mention first stop
is the Weaver looks sheer cheek and this
just come in a set again I know it needs
clean don't forget me guys I've just
littered us use this it's the only thing
I use for my blush now it's just got a
really great angle on it it's really
soft you can't work in the cheek shade
super easily it's anything I reach for
so that's first next up is the Real
Techniques blush brush and I use this
for bronzing generally now so I'll whip
it into the bronzer and it's just got a
really great soft brush that used to
wind up along the edges of my cheeks and
down the con
tools as well as around the edges of the
neck and down the nose it's just
extremely soft it doesn't molt for me I
reach for it daily
my favorite contour brush is this one
it's the loo easy on l15 one I believe
yes I've never used contour brush better
than this shape of it being so soft flat
and square it's great for getting right
into those contours underneath your
cheekbones it's just a really great
shape and really enhance the way I did
my contour as soon as I got this and
I've run out of these products that's it
of course I will leave all the links
down below for all of these products in
order so this is something that you
