so so well I'm going to run through my
mother's Fashion Week outfit so you can
I ran through my New York Fashion Week
outfit last week maybe 10 days ago
something like that I'll leave a link on
the screen now if you haven't already
seen that just going through everything
that I wore for New York so I want to do
the same for one thing cuz quite a lot
of you seem to really enjoy it and I
also really enjoy putting this together
- it's been such a great London Fashion
Week it's all over now
it's a very exhausting process and I
need to write more blog posts on London
Fashion Week because I feel if so many
people that would like to go who aren't
too sure about how they get there what
the process is and all that kind of
thing and so I need to do a lot more
writing on this just in case and if you
are quite interested but it is really
good fun and it's incredibly inspiring I
didn't feel amazing to come in and miss
yourself in the whole fashion world and
to really see what's coming up the next
season and what the inspiration is
please and all that so it was a really
amazing week
it was also incredible because I was
joined by the Glamour magazine team
which is amazing they want to do a video
around the idea of follow along a
fashion blogger at Fashion Week and they
created an incredible video for all the
better than any vlog that I could have
ever made which is really really cool
even if you're kind of interested in
kind of seeing something like a behind
the scenes follow me along fashion vlog
from London Fashion Week's and honestly
go and click this link unless she's
heading back means to go and to make
sure I don't mix up these days so first
Instagram this is what I wore
gate 1 love this outfit ok so literally
went with was this beautiful Louboutin
Capucines mm I think that's right so
it's not the medium sized Capucines bag
this is in the Magnolia pink and a lot
of you ploy know if you've watched in
previous videos I lost it at about 6 to
8 months I think really really loved it
and finally got my handset from best
year so there's a pre-owned purchase and
I absolutely love it which is like new
and so it's a great professionally so
what that and to continue those Pink's I
wore it with this beautiful coat I kind
of wore a very similar coat Ashley last
week in New York Fashion Week for New
York Fashion Week and that was a bit of
a different material a bit thicker this
is more of a lightweight jacket needs a
coat almost it's beautiful pastel pink
to button to cinch it in big
yes but this is more of an oversize fit
so it's a lot like it's almost like a
large coat meets a cardigan kind of
styling and it was a beautiful I just
cashed through this over the whole
outfit and with the pink of the bag it
works really really well
I love those two together and of course
pink its massive for the season so I
thought that was Oxford beautiful the
other piece I absolutely love of this
outfit as these trousers so I've got
these chances that the day before I put
this outfit together totally fell in
love with them on the phonic these are
like the trousers I've been looking for
for ages now I saw Victoria Beckham who
probably know is my biggest inspiration
she's an idol of mine I think she's
fantastic
she's wonderful so she was wearing
something very similar to these trousers
at her show which also worth Victoria
Beckham trousers for next season's
winner out yet and I found these so I
wanted like wide leg trousers to wear in
a navy and i found these from all same
and these are absolutely perfect what I
wanted a great wide leg but not too wise
are still very flattering on the leg a
little bit of detailing with a stripe
down side in a black cuts of black
stripes to the Navy trouser a nice
lightweight material not too thick and
also not just in there for food groups
going to fit like a dream I absolutely
love them out I got these in sick so I
got it in my normal size and they say
that cause later on I got a different
pair of trousers and a slightly smaller
size so I'll mention that later but yes
I love these and they're a great piece
for this outfit for a more tailored
style love it and to go with those I
finally got to wear this rag and burn
top which sends my own bit funny when
it's on screen but you might remember I
got this in my upper high street haul
that I did I found sausages from Ragan
Bowen and toast and loved it and I'm not
had time to wear it since then and I had
an outfit for it but it works so
perfectly with this with a navy
so they went together wonderfully and
just for an extract of three I went with
a pair of black heels and I went with
these heels from the your that I don't
get to wear enough so any time that I
can I try not leave out their kind of
side by tulip shape
hence the beautiful work on inside and
cut out and of course the kind of comma
heel
is very deal so that's why I went with
that was outfit one oh no it will live
to alive
I also am in Paris and watches a pair of
Fendi cat eyes pizza love that outfit
actually have so many compliments on the
outfit so nice lot of my friends
messaged me Susie as well especially
Susie message man was right dick I love
it when you do tailored stylingg he
looks amazing when thank you so much
it's really really love to hear so that
was day one outfit one now deku with
absolutely Juli McDonald show and
amazingly in Gil McDowell team actually
lent me a beautiful dress to wear
so embellish so stunning I leave a pitch
on the screen seek a block and it was
just an outfit dream to wear Juli
McDonald it was incredible so Anwar is
my own accessory so what I cannot show
you that dress because I've now sent it
back to the team and I can show you what
a wore it with and I wore it with this
up beautiful pockets of stunning this is
all very certainty from bag in the
Silverton palette color pattern sterling
vulgar gemstone and the amazing
snake-like strap I think I show you this
a few times metallic is just a total
dream but absolutely love this and it
went well with all the metallics in the
dress and to go with the Blues in the
dress code sorry McCulloch but than a
lot of Blues I went with a pair of
Malone Julia's I love the motherfu years
makes absolutely stunning shoes a lot of
teams well and this has worked well with
the colors and the metallic so a bit lot
metallic silver at the link across here
and then the blue so these were great
accessory for that now last piece to
make sure I wasn't cold I thought that
that out where was necessary whilst this
blue woollen long lines jacket from
offense which actually I've actually
worn so much already Laura in New York
I've been wearing it for most events
recently I wore it last night as well
for an event I went to so it's actually
a really really great piece so I wanted
to mention it again does what the hair
is doing today
looks real like this and also my purple
kind of came out is fading out it's now
gone through a really kind of minty mix
with the gray and silver
like it okay so gay three really love it
up and I actually had two outfits for
day three first ones being this
incredible Reis kit that I've shown you
a few times now so I'd opt to wear it
for Fashion Week softeners please in
fact another women I didn't get to wear
the New York I don't think I was in New
York but I wanted to wear it at some
point and I got to wear it because it
was all about green so into this I took
a gorgeous preen bodysuit again curler
screen show and the preen team said they
would like to dress me so I got to that
it's beautiful body suit which now I
can't really obsess sent it back but
it'll be on the screen so you can see it
although I'm actually thinking of buying
one because under stops in love with it
it was perfect so work beautifully with
this green skirt also continued the
forest green shade in that so I wore
that I wore it with my super cool saline
box bag which I don't get out enough and
it's one of my most favorite bags ever
it was one of the most kind of spending
purchases I ever saved up for I say for
this for about a year and a half until I
could actually find the right color of
it I wanted and a black rain I mean it
says it right now but the time it was
really rare we sold out and I just
absolutely love it and it fits a lot in
here it's just a really gorgeous bag I'm
never I ever see anyone else wearing the
Saleen box that girls think white I love
that bag so much it's just so classic
with that I also wore it's incredible
I'm so in love this it's incredible new
leather jacket from all things how cool
is this
this stripy very kind of sports look
scale elasticated cotton fabric around
the back and that very sporty cool vibe
and then to the shoulders is just
beautiful oxford shade with a cream
piping you're just going to break up the
course it's not all about the black it's
just extra color and then you got the
black and white honestly I'm so upset
for this jacket and it fits so well and
through it all it just kind of looks
like cool quite baggage it
I just really love that a lot of people
in look that a lot and the final
accessory where my show me to the rusty
black suit because I love the half-scale
a black boot thing or open e boot thing
and these were perfect choice so this is
the final accessory of the outfit and
probably one my favorite fact I'm not
sure which is for my face because I
really like them
put together so that was outfit in a
Missouri sorry then this was outfit
number four and most probably my
favorite I think this is a Reese laser
kind of trouser suit that I picked up
which like a day before I wore it and as
soon as it came out like yeah perfecting
a fashion week outfit was so pleased so
underneath of suit first of all I wore
this beautiful and you can see what
we're now not quite fixed but really
lovely very soft cotton emotional
physical and I think your bit cockney
fabric roll map super easy but gorgeous
shades very Turk grow personally lilac
lavender all the shades token shades and
it just works really well with this
whole suit now I'll show yo the suit
comprises of these trousers now I've got
these in a sore because then the past
I've had reached trousers and they've
always been a little bit too big
especially when it comes for their
leather trousers it's not always size
going with those I'll be honest so I got
these before and that's just fit really
really well quite tight and fitted but
that I'd rather have them fit is going
to loose these are described as
off-white and in fact they're a little
bit more cream than the Blazer you
probably might not be off feet on camera
here but when I started having pictures
taken I start to realize these are
actually slightly more cream but it
actually doesn't bother me that much a
film color difference is very
insignificant they work really well
together to realize if I go into store
and pick up rather than getting it kind
of online I might be able to pick
another pair of trousers come pretty
surely do a few pairs of white trousers
this season so I would maybe just have a
little look around
but these fit really nicely bit more of
a cropped style which is what I want
it's not too long because it works
really well with the heels which are
showing sec so those were childhoods and
this is a blazer which is absolutely
stunning and I've been looking for a
blazer like this for a few months now
and nothing else to find one and I was
looking at this value on which is about
sixteen hundred pounds like no I don't
want to spend that on a white blazer
that's not going to ruin where it's
there it's just absolutely perfect and
it's reach so it's not exactly like a
lower high street price it's obviously
if I had to price but it's something I'm
going to wear so much obviously although
I put it on and within five minutes it's
already got makeup on the sleeve well
that's just
it'll come out fine I'll get it
dry-cleaned so let's eat together with
this lovely taupe top and then these
heels are an absolute favorite Malone
junior new season shoes in a goddess
metallics of silver rose girls and their
girls here and the rest is all black and
again I got so many compliments on these
or beautiful Newell's are very easy to
walk in I got my normal size and they
fit really well after meals I know kind
of cut you off at the back here and it's
often better to go maybe half size up so
maybe say if you can get buying them and
you can get it half size of pad made or
half size that probably is but if not
then these two fit me fine as my initial
size I think they're absolute stunning
and then the bag all the back ok so I
was going to the morbus show so I wanted
to take along my brand new mulberry and
this is the new Bayswater style bag it's
beautiful
it has got so many gorgeous details or
the new branding from Albrecht beautiful
black or in leather which is very very
mean it also comes with a strap which is
inside bag which isn't too long which is
great so you can wear this crossbody as
well and pretty sure this is the small
size I will leave the exact link down
below I've got a link for this which is
the perfect link for it if you can find
it but I was so smitten with this bag
and it kind of worked with the black
piping on the shoes and as a nice
contrast to the white suit and finally
outfit number 5 at member type of the
week which like the orange a fork
so all those two outfits in one go final
outfit comprised of a new pair of jeans
now I know a lot of people will be like
oh no you wanting to Fashion Week
that's on it well yeah I wear jeans all
the time generally and I don't believe
that jeans are extreme the casual I feel
you can really dress them up and down
and it is a great pair of trousers to be
honest so these are a pair from page fit
really really lovely they're just a very
simple black skinny jean notice dressing
no nothing
just a well fitted pair of lucky which I
think everyone needs in their wardrobe
quite frankly for accessories a wallet
with a new pet of Chloe boot these are
just a very kind of spring to summer
boots or thought why not wear them to
the transition and I wasn't cold and it
wasn't callback to all this day I do
real of boots that share your terms
think it's quite a nice style so sure if
you pose here you'll cut out inside
great high lengths and beautiful heels
heels were my favorite thing I'm here
also a really lovely buckle so I wore
those in terms of a band I finally got
to wear the new Valley Susie bag really
be truly lots different colors in this
this is the gorgeous one with the white
and the gold
ridet and if you can see this whit's be
little hop kids and be for Bali and I've
actually got quite a lot of space inside
of here it fits a lot in here beautiful
suede lining and then gold hardware
great gold straps too good size too
through a coffee shoulder quite often
like this dad can pour it underneath my
on and cross of my arm it's a very cool
shape and I feel that Valley is really
quite underrated I think it's an amazing
Brown but I always see so many things
there's and totally swing of them I mean
like like that amazing bag I was wearing
last week and coat from Valley apps in
love though so that was that and the
main piece of this outfit which is
completely button which is so it's
called love this apart now I miss
so long it's a still McCarten sheer
beautiful silk fabric with the dog print
all over it I mean how cool seriously I
know it is very unique and a little bit
different especially for me but I just
love it and the flora insight looks so
chic on the model on it for say she all
it kind of bit open like this and took a
little bit tucked into some trousers and
a really big coat through the top and
she does look so amazing and I was like
I look like her so I tried out and
absolutely really loved it I mean I wore
it with my hair up you look really cool
your hair down quite messy as well and
quite fun but I just wanted it would
like my hair often a lot bit sort of
messy at the back and really loved it I
think it's absolutely beautiful sure I'm
pretty sure this comes in trousers it
comes in a dress so if you do like this
print what you're not sure about shirt
then it comes in a few different ways
I'll leave links down below for and the
final thing whether that outfit is the
outerwear was another or things jacket
and it's this more oversized fit
Greymouth woolly coat this really easy
piece just one button to put on your
where it's got a much more oversized
style so the way it falls on your
shoulders a little bit lower
it's got that more kind of
drunkness masculine fix which I really
really liked and I sort of threw it over
top of everything for this outfit
there's a little bit chance there's a
bit of white there's a bit of cream with
black and white and coral another
neutral and through my gray jacket over
top and I really wanted to wear there so
that was the final piece for that outfit
not exactly everything that I wore for
London Fashion Week this time like I
said make sure you check out that
