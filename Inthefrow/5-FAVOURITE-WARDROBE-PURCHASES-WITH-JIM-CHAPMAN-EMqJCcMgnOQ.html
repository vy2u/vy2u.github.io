would you call it maybe like five
essential fine fine top five five five
favorite wardrobe purchases come on
favorite what that's it yeah yeah cool
okay Tom we're filming to shut your face
no you are busy no no good morning
thanks
I realize how much for giant I am Olivia
yes I thought I'm quite tall
you're quite a female yeah yeah okay
right hey guys and welcome back and a
massive welcome to super special guest
this is Jim Chapman look if you didn't
already know
sure you do I love Jim Channel um Jim is
just killin it in the fashion game stop
Oh information so I really really wanted
to film is that we've been trying to
film together yeah a long time cause Jim
does fashion hiding fashion and quite
frankly I really wanted to look in Jim's
fashion closet because I have some
amazing things you're watching yeah well
you're gonna have to wait and see for my
video yeah so today we're filming the
five favorite wardrobe purchases yes
idiot
correct so pretty much I'm South gym and
I've also looked as well to find our
five favorite things we've ever born
ever so ever
yeah feel like things that we just
couldn't live without now again so much
yeah so Jim hopefully through his
wardrobe I what's in my wardrobe I'm
going to show you what we love them up
it's really hard to pick five things
yeah because I'm one of those shoppers
when I buy things I think about
longevity and how long it's gonna be in
my wardrobe how long I got away I'm like
we're it weird and how versatile it is
so picking only five things was tough so
a lot of them have fun like sentimental
value
yeah that's why they're my favorites you
have a story behind yours yeah I'm going
to try and think what my stuff
but you know I can pull out ten things
early on I gotta Whitley's down yeah I
think I've done it do you want to go sit
sure okay yeah and I'm going to start
with actually probably the first thing
chronologically I think and so here we
have a really gorgeous double breasted
berberine hot coat the reason I love
this so much is one is beautiful and
it's camel and it's really wearable and
looks great with jeans or with a suit or
whatever but also this was I felt was
like four years ago there's one of those
things I wear every single year when the
weather's right Tom bought this for me
when I proposed to her in New York and a
few days late who was just shopping
around
we found a missing Marcel is my first
ever item of designer clothing and still
wear it to this day it's I think wool
cashmere mix is gorgeous and I just feel
like a million bucks on where you know
yeah I've seen you in there but no you
look so dapper yeah it's one of those
things I think I think in one of my
first photo shoots like we're gonna
start it myself for GQ I want this and I
will always take this with me I know it
just looks great on and it's one of
those things that is classic and
timeless and forever stylish yes I love
it to pieces
well done tardy burger by Venus hey
what's your first thing okay so seeing
as he went to their brain I'm gonna go
for baby - yeah I brought the very
trench it's so classic isn't it this is
so tiny I haven't that immense whether
it's just like massive in comparison but
I love it I feel like I've got like
trenches are harder to wear for guys
though yeah I know definitely I mean
yeah it's been a few times I've worn and
it's looked a little bit and feminine
only because it's kind of yeah if it
doesn't if you don't work with the right
outfit but it's right with a suit yes I
always think that guys the suit um I
think really yeah really smart in these
kind of things but for me I can wear
this any time of the year because it's
so light it's lightweight but then it
still does keep you all yeah the shower
proof and all that stuff all that good
stuff and it's got the belts you can
pull it in if you want a little bit more
flattering but yeah we're open it's just
throw on cool casual well it just looks
so timeless and classic I actually have
it in this color I don't have it in blue
as well what do you and you'll have a
Navy
I got a navy yeah I think again those
clothes are both really great you can
wear them with a lot of things yeah
definitely
good choice thank you my next thing is
again very sentimental I own a lot of
suits but this suit is the two about
marrying and and it is bespoke so it's
entirely made to my measurement that is
the first time all the things I own and
you'll see I have like an entire
wardrobe full of them I often like given
them by brands and they'll come and I'll
tuck it but this one was really lovely
experience to me I went in about three
or four times and measured me they kept
neither you made I kept measuring the
suit and they made it inside my
measurements when I got married in it I
felt just amazing so it's a 3-piece it
comes with two blades I've got like a
double-breasted waistcoat underneath and
then trousers as well and it's just
really I mean one I got married in it
but it was just the most beautiful suit
that fits like a glove
thank you it's kind of like um a gamo
Harry type thing I won't really classic
with it you know that you when you go
bespoke you can do whatever you want
yeah but I thought I wanted to unless
I'll be wearing forever you know so when
we have nothing your name Superguy is
one of those things that you just need
to have definitely you know wardrobe
staple for any cozily that's gorgeous
thank you Tom Thanks oh you've got good
stories people seeing as he went out
where I'm gonna go from I guess so this
is nice I'm gonna go for the fan man
blade mm-hmm
just because I've got so much use out of
it you know and I feel like everyone
needs a good blazer in there it's also
very bad man isn't it so many things
need to know when you look at it
straight away
stretch it stretch it down shoulders
that's the words about structured
shoulders it just screams Falmouth's
straightaway and then the
double-breasted finish it's just it's so
classic and it's straight way you know
it's pal man yeah it seems like it's
quite tough for a lady to wear a blazer
well I think I can be quite boxy and it
can be quite mastered in but I think
that Brown does it really well yes no
I'd not agreed yeah especially cuz it's
got obviously much more
structure here but it really pulls you
in at the way so it gives you all that
really flattering figure but yeah I mean
I do look lasers but you're right they
can be hard to wear sometimes if you
find the right fit you've got to run
with it and this is a perfect fit for me
so I hope to mention it lovely
ok so what's next next up for me is this
watch this watch is a fairly recent
addition I got it at the beginning of
the year
my wife she the very end of last year my
birthday town bought me this I'm
obsessed with watches and watches can be
very expensive
this one is certainly not cheap and I
was looking at a new watch for a long
time and she's looking at this very
watch and I don't know this she went out
and bought this for my birthday
um and on my birthday she's been
dropping hints about like having kind of
a few presents and you know kind of all
of you looking forward to get your
presents and kind of telling me little
things and leading off into like a
different direction or my actual
birthday she gave me this and I lost my
mind because I mean it's so beautiful um
I know where every single day it's one
of those things where I put it on there
just like it's just really special
special to me personally it's time for
tea but also like people stop me though
and if you were watching beautiful I
know you genuinely think it is one more
song you're suggesting
so yeah love this and it's wise things
that get sold with you as well you know
yeah you can replace the strap at the
shop it's a bit and tarnished or
whatever but for the most part um you
keep your watching good Nick and get it
looked after it will be with you forever
and I can pass it down to my kids if
we're gonna have kids if not my dog
whatever but I think watch is one of the
best investments and yeah I mean they
can be pricey your tea works your budget
but it's one of those things that if you
have one that you've worked hard for and
it's one that you and that means
something to you is yes you can't beat
it that's beautiful without the white
with the rose gold yeah yes by IWC which
um is again my other watches I don't be
so really drawn to this brand I just
think it's stunning it's classic thanks
second beautiful good what's your next
thing thing number three okay hello I'm
gonna go for paraffin one I'm hookin
them now these
they're a little bit unusual yes and
they're very unique
but people my child probably will
recognize these these are apparently
your boots and they were for kind of
madman spring this year right maybe it
was fall last year but they were kind of
like a runaway boot and these are one of
the best things I've ever bought really
they're really amazing I just think
they're so unusual yeah I mean are they
hard to wear because they're well autumn
is the coolest yeah this is quite a lot
going on yeah there is a lot going on
but I just use it whether with a pair
jeans a nice like white yeah right wait
because like I said pizzazz to a pair of
jeans you know I always get compliments
on them even like if Sarah wore them I
think about five people on the street
just went oh my gosh your shoes
yeah actually random people that's nice
yeah I will really loud Jackie by Lou
Vuitton once when I was in New York work
with them and I kept getting stopped on
the street and I thought was because
they were view is not like yes I am Jim
Chapel let me jacket like that from it's
really it's is your economy it's quite
nice yeah yeah especially when you
really take pride in fashion when
someone notices that really makes my day
hmm so yeah so these I would have been
so gutted if I had missed these which is
why I really am so happy they're in my
wardrobe good yeah do you have like a
system where you cycle things out I have
kind of reached capacity particularly
comes to shoes I can't fit anymore no
wardrobe so when I get a new pair I have
to give another pair to my brother yeah
I'll bet your looks oh yeah he loves it
yeah yeah I kinda try and do that I had
a bit of cleanup recently I'm gonna
organize them all and there isn't one
space free now yeah next time it's a
charity shop near mine near where I live
which is just like glorious swimming
with my other things I can't wear any
more Jim Chapman shop yeah my god my
next one is just a blue hoodie which may
sound really boring but is it cashmere
and I love cashmere I if I have the
option I will always wear it I've got
kind of Kashmir everything I will catch
me socks don't wear them very often one
pan away and when I'm in the house doing
nothing because they'll actually be cozy
yeah but it's so soft and it's so sort
of a tactile this fitting is kind of
tipping special doll because this one is
from John Lewis now this is part of my
first edit with John Lewis so last
season and I work with them a basically
until their menswear and they said pick
stuff you like anything other guys are
like and we'll call the gym Chabot edit
or the install it will be online what do
you like so I went through in Styles
their menswear basically and then gotten
yes really an amazing sort of thing for
me to do I think this was one of my
favorite items of any kind of mark the
beginning of it yeah my next edit is
coming out actually buy time until you
guys logical beat you're gonna be out
it's coming out in a few days so this is
kind of old season now I wear all the
time kind of heartbroken and that my
wife borrowed I say borrowed in
quotation marks cuz actually she sold it
and then she kind of got some weird
donkey mark on it which I can't get off
and I don't know what it is thinking the
thing with my wife is that she can't be
trusted
she can't my white because always got
background hey and really when she wears
my things it has to be things that I
don't mind getting ruined
and actually I love this and for me it's
kind of really special because it marks
a big achievement for me
you know um so yeah living its muscles
fine whoa
okay so I've seen you in this yes in
fact this I bought this the premiere of
June when you were trying everyone yeah
and we had a look like yes so I wanted
to mention it because self portrait I
think is a brand a size totally killin
it yeah and it's for dresses straight
away if I've got an event or premiere
something to go to the special I go
straight to self portrait because you
just have the best selection beautiful
colors incredible fabrics so many
intricate details yes lovely just one of
a kind
mm-hmm and this is one that like I said
I got the premier and I've won a few
times since I always get so many
compliments on anything in the back is
so pretty and it got comparing it but
the back is so pretty
it's all cut out and lace work it's just
a dress up like eat for so long longer
is keep wear and see it's amazing events
cuz it's just do you have a thing where
once you've been seeing this on the
ikana again quite often if it's a very
statement dress yeah I mean and this
this kind of but this was just a dress I
love that much there's no way I'm not
wearing it
I think that's was really great being a
guy cuz you wear a suit anyway that's it
again because I was going to no you know
put a different shirt and tie on them Oh
Jim is wearing a different assuming are
not for showing one
but no one really knows but when you
were thing like this you kind of up what
yeah box yeah especially premieres and
events where people are taking photos
are you gonna let any social media it is
hard to wear something again yeah but
for everything else and go today I'll
just keep you send you said I'm not
taking photos I'll still be wearing it
in the house on holiday yeah I mean time
has a thing about our 30 wears she wears
you buy something and she so I have to
the wet it's at least 30 times because I
think there's a kind of an ethos out
there at the moment people buy something
once their guys aren't aware once and
then they'll just not wearing and I
don't think people realize what that
does to the world that he made by
someone he produced and a lot people can
take an advantage job and I think it's
really important to kind of support and
actually wear things lots of times so I
think if you want it to an event you can
then kind of bring it out for ya
different look okay well maybe there are
people taking photos and so it's a yeah
one it's like family meals yeah so
family events and yes get the whatever
outfit then I love this choice my final
thing they're boring actually
spare jeans okay now this kind of and
this is more the style of G so it's
quite hard for guys and girls I have to
find the right genes view I think diet
because everyone's different exercises
you look at it on you know on the image
where you want to go pick them up from I
they look great on they want to try
those ones on and then you realize that
actually you bummed too small thumbs to
bear your big cars
I have very skinny legs like I've got
actually deceptively large thighs with
really really small paths so finding the
right fit is really important so I've
got a few brands that I go to and know
the number or that's the name of the fit
and I just buy them in every color yeah
so these are by Levi's they call five
one two five twelve and there's all the
newest it weather a little bit room
you're up top still slim but they're a
big room and then they kind of have like
a real tapered on the bottom so if
you've got tiny cars like me so I've got
these in three colors and there are Brad
I think lead or a really nice one
forgetting what accord now but they do a
really great fit for me too and again I
don't think you need to spend a fortune
on G necessarily a good quality that
Levi's what you get look for 80 quid oh
yeah got you I mean even Topshop for
women yeah especially for me
sighs it is perfect fit I know like I
said the exact name of them I know the
exact size I need and I can literally go
away and not even have to try the bottle
fit yeah I mean that's why I quit
oh no totally and I think when it comes
to denim is one of these things that
it's really hard wearing and though but
this kind of will be not this color
forever it won't kind of age as I do
which is quite nice but then I can
replace you know and I said best thing
about jeans I think yeah they do just
age anywhere with you yeah so I have
probably I've got loads of has a jeans
they're probably actually only about
three styles I guess I have them in
different colors so yeah I think they're
one my favorite things because I think
is really important when you feel
confident in something and you know
you've kind of nailed it and you can get
them in a few colors on this t-shirt
I have three black three white to gray
to blue and a green because yeah because
I know it fits me and so there you go
actually a pair of sunny
oh they're so nice and then the rebound
Club matters just because I know any day
wait sunny and I rush now I need a
person is these are one thing that will
go with every yeah I don't know why but
they just you see my face mm-hmm it's
quite hard I mean I've got a whole
question for others up there it's hard
to find sunglasses that and match your
face because everyone's different and I
was really hung up at mine help of quite
small head on quite a big body and I
struggled for a long time but now I kind
of know the shape and the style so you
know I did kind of keep getting them
keep buying them because I know I look
good now oh yeah yeah and I feel like
very bad especially the brand fit me
really well yeah but these especially I
just go with everything I love them so
these are definitely thing that I will
always take with me on any trip any time
going somewhere that I need some
sunglasses
I'll have these as I could back up I'm
looking forward to
sunglass and more IRC West spectacles my
ice is appalling put them on really yeah
awful oh my
yes I am legally blind and so I'm
getting laser eye surgery next week yeah
and it'll be really nice to be able to
have sunglasses my pocket and be able to
wear them rather than going oh no no I
can't sit you know and squinting so yeah
I'm really excited to just don't have to
work I mean I actually might like these
on me
a lovely glasses but I want the option
yeah you know I don't want to have to
wear so I might have the lenders removes
but just kind of way they look nice but
