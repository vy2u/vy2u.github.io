as much as I do
so go along to there and subscribe and
give a loads of love cause she deserves
it so today we're excited to film a bit
of a different video it's going to be
five product fakes Charlie Rose on yeah
the idea being that we just create we
both got different makeup we're gonna
create a full lock with just five
products I'm gonna put this in there now
that we're going to omit brows yeah
mainly because some people don't do
their brows some people just use a
spoolie and then some people also get
their died yeah so just for the sake of
keeping it into five products I'm gonna
use side products that aren't you clean
brass yeah I hope that's all good if not
that it thick look off I think it's
really good if you have much time in the
morning to get ready this is just a
really quick like five minutes
yes I've put on face exactly so we're
gonna show it pretty much show you some
of my favourite products and what we
would use if you wanna quickly pop some
makeup with fat products so I really
hope you enjoy this we do it you look
good so let's get started I'm gonna tie
back my hair because I can't some half
of my hair yeah I'm gonna have to talk
mine behind my ears I know it really
annoys everyone but really it's fine I'm
gonna start with foundation okay I'm
mine you have to shake up this is the
Charlotte Tilbury liked one day youth
boosting perfect skin foundation with
SPF I use three fair I love this because
it's like is a moisturizer this
ring Chloe yeah it's quite liked isn't
it yeah I'm gonna go is really do it
this bottle now I'm gonna go for nas
luminous weightless foundation I've got
this in Deauville which is the same that
I've got in the shake low yeah I don't
know which other fair I think I prefer
share blow yo that this is too high
coverage for me yeah it's better for
oily skin types
yeah I'm using my Bobbi Brown this is
called full coverage face brush
why do you think my zoeva look foolish
brush it is quite hot covetous and it is
fairly yellow I think it's more yellow
than now sure glad I think yeah nice
foundations are very yellow have you
used this show at Oprah foundation for
yeah but I think I've got it in a shade
too dark for me I so can't wear it as
much if I always find it does leave a
lovely finish it's nice to use I
actually like you applying it my fingers
I just talked about it to get messy
happens today but it's such a nice like
light foundation do you always do
foundation with your hands no but when
it's like an orbit into moisturizer I
feel like it applies better because then
it doesn't sit on top the skin you
cannot really work into those feelings
and I say that's why I like using a
sponge quite often cuz I find it's
really good to go over your face with
sponge itself i sinks in yeah really
nicely wet your spine yes yeah for ages
I would just spritz the sponge with a
bit of face mist and it works really
well like that as well but then I
started wetting it and then I realized
was how much more it helps to think you
finished yeah Alex amazing on you but
I'm just gonna leave it it's quite a
it's not like heavy at all you still see
my skin but I like it just fine yeah
great and we would have you talked about
this no I put two then the best is the
best brother ever it's like the real
take these fluffy brush but kind of a
bit better quality you don't go through
them as quickly it's so good not just I
love buffing in then then you feel like
you really can't see it on sitting on
top of the skin that's really lovely
it doesn't really like am wearing
foundation I'm gonna leave my foundation
there actually yeah me too I'm it's just
for an everyday look so yeah okay so got
wet sponge by the way just just to make
it clear we're not including our tools
yeah I put up this is just for the
fabrics that going on the face yeah I
could probably use oh no not for my
bronzer I couldn't use my hat everything
else good yeah yeah like streaks I'm
sorry that I'm staring you I love what
you people do they make it like I'm a
viewer here
okay so sealer step two I'm
gonna use the Charlotte Tilbury the
retouch up that's a Charlotte Tilbury in
this one but I actually I've got like
three concealers I like the NARS one the
urban decay one and this one I've run
out of the other two so it's just one of
those really easy like windup why don't
say throne brightening for under the
eyes if I have founded the eyes and face
but I'm just gonna use they're
everywhere it's a bit of a to chic la um
not really because I don't like the
tissue club because it's more like a
highlighter and is this like yeah this
is like an actual concealer if I got
good coverage it's just got like nice
light not highlighting brightening yeah
sorry to put under my eyes dominoes I
always get red around my nose me too
so what can see though using so I'm
using the Clarins instant concealer
which is just one of those like Holy
Grail products I know it's gonna do a
good job but you've got a good skin you
can use just that because you can use
that bit like foundation as alright yeah
it just go a long way to smell yeah and
it's so easy to blend it's just yeah
it's a fave and I merely ran out so I'm
gonna go buy a new one yeah without a
doubt I'm just like passing it in with a
sponge where your eyes is I'm using the
real techniques setting brush to blend
mine I think it's like the perfect sized
brush I love that brush concealer right
okay for two parts down third product
okay my third product is this soap &amp;amp;
Glory soda powder bronzer because I
think if I had to pick the teen bronzer
and blush bronzer
I just can't this is the one's difficult
miss I don't even know why I'm not that
pale but I just feel like it changes my
face me too so I do like going out
without any bronzer on known I love it
so I'm gonna go for the hourglass
ambient lighting powder
mainly because it has a few different
products in it so it's got this
beautiful like bronze here on that I
love as a bronzer I could glowy bronzer
and the middle running use of a
highlight and then I also use with my
shadow oh yeah I'm gonna use mine as an
eyeshadow as well because this has got
like one matte side and one slightly
would she Mireille a bit shimmery yeah I
love that palette let's use them
together it's such a good one
and it's such a lovely mic muted shadowy
brown shade isn't it yeah he's a big
fluffy brush if he just wasn't all over
town but and I also sometimes used to
Charlotte Tilbury sculpt and powder and
sculpt brush if it on the mat side to
contour a little bit yeah colors and
onto my cheeks actually as like a blush
- I'm gonna start using this as an
eyeshadow I think I'm just gonna take
the matte Brown shot Brown side you
putting that all over our Oh to the
crease and all over and then look
underneath it's nice oh it's lovely you
kind of like a a winning brown yeah just
using a zoeva crease brush I love these
as if money - my favorite they're so
good we have tried to say this is the
Real Techniques blush brush and it's
incredible with this palette it's so
good I'm just gonna move on to the cheek
brush which is in the NYX picks
collection I'm going to use that with
the middle shade as a light make me one
that palette ya know I've got I've just
got one of the hourglass powders that I
used to set my makeup my clothes all
that I've done a little shimmery oh I
kind of thought it think it was so
beautiful and I've used it today I love
it
do you have these very light does that
you makeup no diffuse oh yeah I think
it's the fuse like it's beautiful
make up and I'm just gonna use these
Oliva look soft crease I'm gonna perfect
this bronzy tonin
okay I've done my bronzy and I shine a
step so a bit fast
sorry I'll wait I'll wait that's nice as
it I said they're pretty isn't it
there you go I like an orange toned
bronzer that I showed before yeah I
really like it it's a good one
I often put this in like when I go
travelling about something or to this to
Disney oh you do yeah it's really nice
everything although I should have done
like to shade first cuz now I've got a
dirty brush it's okay I'm going to use a
very shimmery bit just on the wood very
pretty
okay yeah really nice okay get it
mascara
yeah um benefit roller lash which you
didn't really get on with that well but
I really like it
I've got quite naturally curly lashes so
I think that's probably what we do see
yeah but I feel like this really kind of
lengthens and defines and I've just
finished mine so Victoria gave me hers
I'm very happy I know it just
I have very I've talked about so often
but my arch is really straight so I'm
going to use my schumer eyelash curlers
but you can pick up any I don't know
someone who uses fast and then I'm gonna
use the Lancome Hypnose doll eyes
waterproof because it's just fantastic
holding a curl I love this mascara
something about the wand look how it
works my gosh it really does okay my
mascara is done sorry I'm quite far so
um I don't put that much on it this is
just like an easy day look just like a
few strokes that it's that's such a good
mascara it's lovely isn't it
I need to try that I do um be dexterous
with you mascara don't you do it all
with your right hand or with my right
now alright do use your left
yeah right yeah right right let's select
I don't know why I don't know why
I'm so jealous I can't do anything with
my left hand like I can't even pick
something up from the table hideous
you can't me nobody I can but I would
never I would never go to you I realize
I was like that to see I would never use
my left hand for anything
oh really wish my brows were doing point
number five okay mines in lipstick - um
it's from Lancome it's number two one -
it's kind of like a blush e-news but I'm
gonna try these as blushes on I know I
can make put a little bit my cheeks I
doubt my word is my most cheese lipstick
every process you can see an S but this
is so YSL rouge developed nude beige
number one and it's my favorite famous
noble like famous yeah I love that shade
though I've been using that a lot it's
kind of glossy they're quite a few
products that we could use for more than
one thing
yeah absolutely like I feel like like I
personally like to have dark brows with
this hair so I probably would do my
brows and leave it vile I know but if
I'm just nipping out and I needed tried
products these would be the ones I
choose yeah I always wear eyeliner but I
think there's some days it's quite nice
to just have it makes you look a bit
more fresh yes I'm sorry I agree yeah a
bit mascara on a little bit of like
eyeshadow an inner corner your eyes are
so pop yeah yeah I think we did well at
Lowe's
