video so I'm going to do the 50 facts
about me tag let's go
today is my birthday 18th of July is my
birthday and I'm 25 years old today this
morning asked route to the most
beautiful bouquet flowers as you see
here from team bloom and another
beautiful bouquet of sunflowers from my
lovely fly mate I've had purple and pink
hair now for the past two years I prefer
wearing bright colors over dark colors
moment I just think it matches my hair
nicely during the day I work at the
University of Manchester as a fashion
retail lecturer I am also currently
finishing my PhD at the moment which
I'll be handing in two weeks
and hopefully if all goes right then I
will soon be a doctor of fashion I got a
first class honours degree in design
management for fashion retailing
I've lived in Manchester for the past 8
years 7 years 7 years I play the guitar
and I will soon be buying brand new
guitar the mini-mart in Alex Rock which
I'm super excited about and used to play
the flute at the piano keyboard and
recorder Plus that was a really large
record of the really big on I started
blogging around 20 months ago now in the
froude calm in that time I have won two
company magazine blog awards won s the
personal style newcomer in 2013 and this
year as a personal style blogger 2014 my
favorite food in the world is chicken
liver pate I just my favorite colors are
turquoise peach turquoise and peach I
prefer wearing heels and boots of flat
shoes and 5 foot 7 I hate Marmite the
love peanut butter I own probably around
75 pairs of shoes
I love music and I love rap music
happened to some incredible geeks over
the last four years including Bruce
Springsteen Bon Jovi NASA and firm bryan
adams REM this goes on and on and on and
on my favorite sport to watch is
basketball I have a huge fear of sharks
so much so that sometimes I don't feel
like to go in swimming pools cuz I'm
scared when I was around eight or nine I
had an obsession with collecting lights
and lamps so at one point I had like 12
13 lamps in my room all going at once
sorry dad I love dark silence I just
scream at dogs they're so cute and
they're always so friendly and so happy
just makes me so happy if I handed them
the PhD and hadn't got a jobs lecture I
would probably now be working marketing
a PR for a fashion brand I used to
always dream of living in New York or LA
for the rest of my life I've actually
changed my mind now and I would really
like to move down south to Brighton I've
been travelling twice now Oster America
for ten weeks and recently again to
America three weeks now I've got a bit
of a traveling bug and would like to go
to Canada or Vietnam Australia New
Zealand I'd also have to go around the
Scandinavian countries as well my
favourite way to spend an evening is
going out for food and a boyfriend going
having a nice wine and really yummy meal
but I don't have to cook and then wash
up one of the most random things I've
ever done and take them to go on the
front of a packet of crisps you notice
in this packet of crisps real crisps
this one is me ever see a pack let me
know pull a one the best days of my life
was when I got to go whitewater rafting
down the kicking horse river in
Vancouver Canada it was the most
exhilarating of fullest experience I've
ever ever had I was a ballerina from the
age of 7 up until around sick
Steen and it's a biggest regret of my
entire life giving it up I gave up
ballet and dancing because I was in
college and then have enough time I had
to get a full-time job and I started
getting a boyfriend and there's no time
for anything else
if I had one superpower I think I would
choose to fly and still love the idea
I've been able to fly anywhere over
everyone and they might have dreams I
have about flying it's ridiculous you
