to get shoes I hope I named some
accessory yeah that was so so difficult
I find hard I'm really really difficult
I took a few hours on it
me too it sounded good that so what
we've done is I've chosen an outfit
under 50 pound for Roxy an on Roxy's
channel she has chosen a 50 pound outfit
for me so I'll leave a link down below
and also remind you at the end about
that as well so you can watch part 1 and
part 2 in effect and you can see which
of the outfits you like the most
yes this is all under fifty pounds so
I'm thinking it pretty well I hope you
like it though I will okay first piece
that I took me home behind it I thought
this was really cute this is an
off-the-shoulder Bardot black dress
lover and I know it's kind of very basic
and just very chilled well I thought
with all the right accessories
yeah that's so me I really like that I
was just trying to picture in all this
stuff and white you look really gorgeous
in it so I felt a little tiny let me
flee I'm going to go and there's some
accessories on some cute shoes a nice
bag
you can just kind of dress
this was 15 pounds no way right
so good yes like something like this
that you'd find out on top shot they'll
be well expensive yeah probably like
throw your 40 pounds yes exactly yes
really yeah nice actually
yes no clear dress pretty song yeah okay
so fifty you know judge well done on
that yeah yeah it's hard it's like the
base product for that yeah yeah and then
the shoes yeah
I was thinking of going for a dress as
well I thought I want to get like more
pieces in and try and get like more into
the budget but always make like that
made us so much more different I know
we'll see the found a Semite right I'm
gonna build out and around it okay okay
I'm gonna go to the shoes you get out
you can have all these one mega cute so
like a lace-up sandal oh I love these
season me look ah how cute they are
adorable baby like a maraca
yeah cuz he was so huge at the moment
I'm really like on trend whenever like
cute little pom-poms but it just adds a
little bit more color then when I walk
is gonna be like Judah man like little
cat oh I thought they were lovely though
I'm really into these shoes a moment I
almost feel like I've made this outfit
for me yeah no no it tote it stoning me
as well yes super cute release then so
these were $17.99 that's pretty good
yeah I've been you look as well yeah not
too bad I was good yeah I think it's you
just have the hardest one yes although
somebody though okay so this is not
accessory I've got you this again good
new look and again it's kind of very
trend lead right now but it's one of
that the long choker a style it's a
little bit early Western II yeah
what sort of Garnett and then it's kind
of here and now going all over the dress
yeah joke a bit more detail on the black
dress
exactly that's really cute and exciting

it's so on trend as well it also feels
like some sort of leather came yeah like

I got you this back so this is from
glamour and it's a little clutch Chuck
how fun is that we twelve pound no way

pretty like for somebody and just don't
even spice up like any outfit and
especially because it's so like black
base and it's like such a nice pop of
color

use and so on you can even put like
heels on with this outfit and go out for
like drinks and then yeah yeah cuz it's
