so so well this video has been 3 years
in the making by the time you are
watching this video I will reached
500,000 YouTube subscribers
the excitement is real it's just a bit
I've got no words for it I never ever
thought I would reach 500,000
subscribers I mean I never thought I'd
reach thousand subscribers and then
100,000 was just a little bit
mind-blowing and now half a million is
something I never thought I would reach
so the biggest thank you to all of you
for subscribing and supporting me and
always being there and being so positive
it's just I love this community so so
much yes thank you for everything so I
wanted to kind of give something back
this is like a huge giveaway video I
picked up a few things of the last month
or so unless you really really wanted to
get them away as a prize so in fact
there are five prizes seeing us it's my
five hundred thousand giveaway I feel
like it needs to be five prizes and
they're all pretty amazing so it's gonna
be pretty simple to enter the giveaway
to win some these prizes I will leave a
link down below but first of all let's
actually look at the prize it's okay so
fifth prize in the haka flight it's
going to be some little pieces from
Victoria's Secret which I thought was
pretty appropriate seeing this on
Victoria thought it would be so nice a
good way so this is a Victoria Secret
look more odor puffs arm in 50ml and
this is a gorgeous gift set the
Victoria's Secret EXO Victoria tea set
so you get the fragrance lotion the Eau
de Parfum and the fragrance powder and
it's got a little powder puff it's
really beautiful is that
so those come ask this really fourth
prize is a kind of limited edition set
that you can't get anywhere else it
comes this black box like much but when
you open it up inside you'll find five
as a limited edition
Victor and Ralph Flowerbomb cents these
are all of the different limit edition
bottles that they have been seen in I
mean look how gorgeous this one is so
beautiful and that comes in this little
gift box so that was just mostly the
same prize it's just you can't get this
anywhere else so if you bet for
collecting you look at perfumes
I thought you guys might a little bit
prize number three
it's from Michelle she won money and
this is a set of their incredible
brushes right here and the maestro blow
this isn't shading before which it kind
of it's a shade that's almost like bit
too dark for me and hopefully it will
see one of you if not you could blend
this in with your dark foundations are
lighter foundations depending on your
skin tone to kind of still reap the
rewards of cementing foundations is like
my favorite foundation so I really
wanted to give it away and here there
are so many brushes we've got you can
see the brush the foundation brush lip
brush flat eye brush spot concealer
brush the blender brush angled eye brush
and another eye brush so literally
little brushes and the foundation that's
prized with great prize number two is
another pretty insane gift box again you
can't buy a where else and it's a gift
box of all of the Maison Margiela
replica scents inside this is my
absolute favorite offices Beachwalk it's
absolutely beautiful
it's also T skate promenading the
gardens lipstick on latest in the
morning by the fireplace pull everything
and also flower market
there's eight different scents can
Maison Margiela range and these are all
absolutely beautiful honestly such as
present - and prize another one is a
pair of the GHD platinum serene pearl
straightness comes this gorgeous lilac
bag and it's got the liner key two-toned
so pretty inside so that surprise in the
one so as you can see the prices don't
really go up or down in value by the way
I just label these as price one two
three four five there's no kind of
difference in price or difference in how
much I think you'll love them it's just
I have five amazing prizes I need to
kind of put a number on each one so
that's each and every prize for the
500,000 giveaway so to enter all you
