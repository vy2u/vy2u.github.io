like this is Victoria really yeah I
don't know there's three different sizes
to the case nobody's defend I should
have done that I didn't think to do that
should no actually the reason I didn't
do that it's because everything was sold
out in different sizes so I was like
perfect I can get this one so it will
work out so this video is kind of like a
two-parter so make sure you also watch

No
okay so I saw this piece this was 14
pounds which I thought was pretty good
it's kind of me but I also got this kind
of you oh my god this is kind of me kind
of me yeah that's all for 14 pound job
really nice really nice your Tyrael as
well love a little knit it's kind of
very so much one right now but that's a
bit more neatly the knit version yeah
it's really for I love this brand Jack
came too young and I haven't either
sure okay boots always 14 pounds so I
kind of tried to build the outfit around
that maybe so we're trying to go the
autumnal wintry here this is more
difficult okay so okay so I thought I
know when to option can be quite dark
and dreary well why don't you try to
grind up with a little spice of white
okay oh man I think they should fit so I
almost have a feeling I have these I got
them for Fulmer oh my gosh that's so
nice I keep right oh how much for these
those jeans were yeah 1699 amazing
yes oh I love this so far okay hopes
neck oh good okay I need you to get your
jacket opposite because wintry and I saw
this one this one 29.99 okay we're
almost reaching 75 pound market oh wow
this is nice do you think oh I love the
shoulder right love it obviously like a
faux like fake leather yeah biker but
it's an anonymous as well as well
yeah nice like zip work and also no real
colors I thought if you wear open could
be quite cute yeah and also you just
throw a scarf on with it too but I
thought for $29.99 but kind of like a
faux leather right
right and I thought again Oh every day
well we've got the net love it the
we're 15 pounds and I thought that'd be
kinda more that kind of chilled that
option and we have white jeans I love
