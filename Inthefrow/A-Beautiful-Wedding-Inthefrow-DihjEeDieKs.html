lessons your time and stand for two pole
so she could pulled up in the kitchen
two years I'm in the middle of the
kitchen unattached to the floor or the
ceiling and therefore the hover to
anyone who does swing follows the turn
went desk freely over her shoulder head
down Bonilla and Romney across the road
to escape catholic males coming towards
us reading she's away on a full golf
crawl but there's managed to sell a
three-pound got fiber to a guy in a club
220 pounds like a new business woman
treated herself to a pizza for speeding
and honestly though all of these stories
I could tell you for the past eight
years of my life would show you how much
fun laughter an amazing time for art I
think there is something wrong this and
then that I
day reading this speech there is
something about that that magnetized me
to her as soon as we met we both did my
face really separate Cuba announcement
in that time said at the time we both
know exactly all teacher business but
also has been so much more the district
read to me she was the most caring
selfless and lovely person I've ever met
she kept me three some off times and we
also love for equally amazing times she
was like the big sister I always wanted
and my laundry cart
she knew my secrets even before I had
told her and she cannot tell exactly
what about stating before that it just
returning my voice

became work mate and flatmates and one
of the much of the very best of friends

our plans and dreams of the future
