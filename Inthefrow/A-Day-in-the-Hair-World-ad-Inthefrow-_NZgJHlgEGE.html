looking at not like this anymore

little bit late so you two hurry up I've
just got a my usual whistles black dress
honest just like one the best things
ever whatever and I've got my zombie
tour Rusty's as well
don't had a great little lunch no now
I'm back it's actually been so long
since I got back that I have actually
already just eaten lunch again so that
was almost like a breakfast route that
was a breakfast just had lunch aren't
mean access made lunch now I'm just
going to sit down and do some work so
I've just been there's gonna be ICS but
I've just been checking out my new
comments on my name my favorites video

place
and now I'm just gonna write this blog
post which is about a dinner mean Alex
had at West 36 and nothing else has got
to write that now and saying I need to
start your to read date for tonight's
event so I'm going to take off all of
this makeup of course and I've got a
beautiful dress to wear from a qaq which
amazing already if you follow me on
instagram it's a beautiful peach dress
really long maxi with a sequin skirt
okay we're back you're just showered I'm
ready to put on more makeup hence when I
look at this dress all pretty excited
about tonight I don't really know what
to expect from it I'm quite looking
forward to it and it's also black-tie
event
and I've been to black-tie event before
so that should be quite nice
I'll give you an idea well this is
tonight's dress choice its peach with
iridescent tails to it so I need
something okay so now listen my camera
just died
what Sal's doing that by thought in the
day this isn't really meant to be full
get ready with me it's meant to be more
about going to the event so I've put on
the dress and probably a felicitous
dress seriously it's absolutely
incredible
so just kind of finished obviously
whilst doing our show you and Sheila
shaded
okay so this is pretty much what I was
hoping for I think it as big zone is it
- and now I've run out time so it's just
it's going to have to do to be honest
it's not the neatest thing you read in
my life but I straighten bliss and yeah
this will have to be my final look I
guess so off to the event

I have to say what an amazing event so
far at the time I come to these I walk
my stone expired the shows are just
breathtaking there has been so much
deliberation that the judges would load
away and the teamwork has been fantastic
it really has been noticed in spoke
about by the judges the tea backstage so
the Northern Irish regional Rory colour
Trophy winner is awarded to
hey guys so it's just the next day but
as we surround up this vlog and just say
thank you so much L'Oreal for having me
yesterday at the hair trophy award
it was so cool it was really kind of
inspiring to see so many kind of local
hairdressers and hairdressers from all
around the UK he was so inspired by hair
and we're so creative I'm just creating
these really incredible colors and
styles and just really thinking outside
the box and to see how happy they were
when they worn was just so wonderful to
say that kind of so much excitement it's
really nice to see the more professional
hair side of L'Oreal because also they
have so many different types of brands
that are underneath erm brands L'Oreal
itself has so many different types of
things going on in terms of hair and
makeup but they also have this very hair
professional side and the fact they have
so many hairdressers that work
underneath the L'Oreal brand it's just
really really inspiring it's really
great thank you so much the L'Oreal for
having me I really really hope you
