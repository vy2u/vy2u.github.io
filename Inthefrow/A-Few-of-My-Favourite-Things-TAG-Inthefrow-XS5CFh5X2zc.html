hello 200,000 of you can actually leave
a pit of despair subscribers is such an
amazing amount of you it's kind of bit
evil thank you so much for subscribing
and being a sport and being a subscriber
for as long as you have been its maiden
to have you and I'm just so so happy so
today I wanted to make a new tag this is
going to be the few of my favorite
things tag the idea being that you talk
about a few of your favorite things in
different categories a few meaning 3 as
it's generally known 3 few so you have
to answer three of your favorite things
for each category to answer categories
and they are all on gender specific
Javanese and girls who both do this time
just as easily
it isn't about beauty isn't really about
fashion or anything like that it's just
about general questions so anyone can
answer them all so sticking with the
three theme you've got to do it within
three minutes so the body of your video
apart from after the intro and the
ending so the body of the video with the
questions has to be in three minutes so
there's no babbling there's no mumbling
on about things that why I would like
things said this has got to be boom boom
boom I like almost like a bit of a
challenge I was just in the shower
yesterday and thought you know what I
really make a tag and some reason aside
thinking of a song from the Sun music
and thought you can't sing along to
another like a few of my favourite
things
oh cool I'll do that that's what I'm
going to name my tag so the tag is
called a few of my favourite things and
that's what it's going to be all about
so I've written down all my questions
here
ready to answer and it's just got to be
short fly around really really quick
complete left of your head unscripted
just so you can try and get everything
out quickly know for any youtubers
watching this and want to do this tag if
you want to edit your video down a copy
that's totally fine as long as it can
keep something and have three-minute
boundaries we just want to keep this
short and sweet people you have no one
else positive this tag at least I did
something different and hopefully you
enjoy it the waste is gonna work is I'm
just like should put down words
Chris so if you imagine that the
category is just type of favorite things
