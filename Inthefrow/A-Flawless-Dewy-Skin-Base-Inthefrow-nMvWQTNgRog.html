really liking to do my makeup recently
just add so much more of a glow I'm
gonna start off for the body shell
vitamin C energizing face mist and just
spray that all over just to start the
skin is feeling amazing first things
first you can use any serum you like but
as always I'm currently on this whole
body sharp drops of youth thing and I'm
really liking it so just getting a
little bit of a serum is something else
I can't live without now after that you
can use moisturizer at the moment I'm
really enjoying the Elizabeth Arden skin
balancing lotion again you'll have seen
this exact routine in my other videos
but this is just like the combo and
really enjoying at the moment this is a
step you don't have to do what if you
want to just make sure that your pores
are filled and beautiful a bit more
smooth feel free to go in with the body
shop volume on insta blur and rub that
oh you've been my cheek those were my
paws okay so the difference I've been
doing recently is I'm not going to apply
my concealer now before my foundation so
the few that I've really been drawing
using you don't have to do this you have
to use three concealers like I'm about
to do just the way I've been really
enjoying it so first of all I'll use the
NARS creamy concealer in vanilla I'm
gonna add that into this inner corner
here
I could pull into this entire thing up
just with that concealer thought I've
been really enjoying doing a few then
I'm gonna use a collection concealer
lasting perfection this is quite a hold
now but still going and it's this in the
fair shade and it's just a little bit
lighter than that vanilla so it's great
as a highlighting shade for underneath
the eyes last but not least you'll seen
it every single time the Clarins instant
can see their clean hands I'm gonna add
that just below just for a little bit of
depth of color
I took my Real Techniques sponge make it
down a lot of people keep asking me
what's the point in putting this on it
mainly because I'm kind of odd right now
to get up to a sink and make it down
plus add a sink why not put on a really
nice mist aunty brush auntie sponge
instead of water you can also take over
nose and underneath it so I will take it
round all this section now I did
actually miss one step I got too ahead
of myself and I was going to add the
temple spa look on the bright side this
is an instant radiance booster and what
I've been doing after found it and after
applying the moisturizers is that I've
been applying this with a buffing brush
I love the face doesn't matter I can now
dis apply it in with my foundation
instead it's not a big deal my Real
Techniques buffing brush so I'm gonna
add this to the back of my hand first it
looks like quite like a bronze bottle
but when it goes onto the skin it just
shares out totally so you'd have to
worry about that and then my choice of
foundation at the moment because I've
been tanning is the Illamasqua
skin base i have this in 5.5
okay was gonna work those two together
I'm just gonna work that into the areas
that I didn't touch with a concealer
and with this radiance booster should
just add a little bit more light
particles into the foundation which
means that more light is going to bounce
off your face and just make it look even
more flawless and chewy okay now for the
extra added light well I've really been
loving is this it's a Clarins instant
light radiance boosting boosting
complexion face this is a product that
when I first got it I just wasn't about
key on it and thought what's the point
in this however since then absolutely
love it it's amazing for adding a bit
more sort of shine and chewiness we've
got a little bit to hand it looks pink
toned it has this almost glittery pink
luminescence about it and we're going to
add it onto the bottom of buffing brush
not too much I'm just gonna add this to
my cheek bone around face down the nose
to centre of the forehead very lightly
they'll see don't go close it's almost
like yeah I think the light back into
the skin really lightly it works really
nicely on the forehead down the nose on
the end of nose
keep your films bringing the light
through Hughes I'm just gonna put on my
trusty by Terry
lip balm cuz that just looks amazing on
nude lips like today on my favorite
products ever I think this lip balm if
you'd watch my last one of my last
videos the beauty trends for 2015
I mentioned baby lips by Maybelline and
a lot of you said please try out show us
how you use it now baby lip become her
number of different colors one of them
being completely clear which would pull
work fast
I have the shade just peachy here I just
recommend non shipping tips our faces
look focused catching light in all the
right places without being too much not
to disco ball II apply my brows with a
dip brow from Nastasia
anastacio and the over brown eyeliner
then I've really been getting back into
using my Charlotte Tilbury cool
chameleons this is in the shade and
behave gonna add a wash of color of this
to my eyelid I'm just applying it dark
at the base
and I'm just going to use a brush to
smudge that out it just looks nice and
smoky but we're really simple as well
this can do that to the rally after
that's done in my usual style I'm just
gonna add a little bit of a shampoo and
highlight you can use any that you like
I'm just using some from the vice
palette from them okay I think it's a
tiny bit into the inner corner I'm just
going to use my hourglass palette
because this is such a beautiful radiant
color so just a little bit of this just
into the hollows for a little bit of
definition and this will just add it to
glow
so that's the base done pretty much I'm
just gonna finish off with some ink for
eyes by urban decay as my eyeliner right
over the top with quite thin line it
gets thicker towards the outside and
then it's a very small flick to each
side and that's it super jewy dry
illuminated skin with my usual I makeup
pretty much but hopefully it's been
nicer to see something a little bit
different because I don't usually do my
makeup like this with the concealer
first then the makeup around the outside
with a really illuminated base and the M
and the baby lip for the cheeks as well
so I personally love it I just feel
really dewy and really flawless with
this skin now and I'm also a big big fan
of this eye look as well at the moment I
think it looks really simple and
laid-back also really really sultry and
pretty yes I'm ready to start the day
now I really really hope you enjoyed
