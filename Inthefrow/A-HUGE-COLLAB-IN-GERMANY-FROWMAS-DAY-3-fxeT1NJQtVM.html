plane over to Frankfurt Germany to start
working on a super exciting campaign
that meant going on and so you'll find
out much more about that which is that
like so obvious what I'm working on as
soon as you see it but I'm really really
excited so I'm just gonna call and it's
so early and we've got an hour though
now to wait for the actual like plane
till that was armed
getting my back
hidden French luggage this was easy
this place is so like clean spotless it
clean it's really almost like no one
here it's really nice to fly early I
think I'm going to try and do the floor
Lauren Fletcher

okay guys it's been on it's been a few
hours since I saw you but things are
gonna let their hectic so I'm not going
to come to say hello and tell you what
hell it's going on so I am working with
Vauxhall or Opel if you're not in the UK
and just in their huge this is a huge
warehouse that's the car over there it's
called the rock salt atom and it's a
personalizable car so you can
personalize all the colors in it on the
outside the inside it's so cool and it's
gorgeous like this one over here it's
just getting I went from our with purple
berry red color with a white roof on it
and this one's micro copper sharing this
one is white with a blue roof but you
can personal a different cause and you
can have different called seats in it
and if a clerk wheel trims like there's
a rose gold well to remember that was
incredible
so yeah so I'm working with the Vauxhall
a nice campaign with about 8 of the
European walk
and youtubers as well so I'm kind of
here for the UK which is really cool and
the idea is that I'm going to personally
I think a car kind of choosing my own
colors and everything which is really
exciting and and then I'll be telling
you guys on my blog and later on
downline about competition you can enter
and you can can't create and fly into
our own car and people can vote for you

be too rough seas mucho gawd when we put
this net on his dad it's got so many
things so at the moment I'm in my own
space so everyone has their own space
with all their worlds so it's almost
like a recreation of our usual setup so
