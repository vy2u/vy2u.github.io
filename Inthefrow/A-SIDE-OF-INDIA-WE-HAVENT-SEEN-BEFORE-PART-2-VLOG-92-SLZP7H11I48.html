have a chill I'm gonna do some work and
how am I gonna go in a pool and have fun
this is a pool this is amazing
wow wow wow wow wow wow just get myself
ready for day I didn't my boss and I my
camera died which is super cool start a
new day today's Saturday I'm just
starting off the morning with some
breakfast and then we're gonna go into
the bazaars and I did that this palace
is absolutely amazing I think the more
by Palace in Cheyenne polka Palace are
all absolutely amazing but something
insane about this place take you for a
spin Thomas thank you
all I'm using is a Lumia Andy but for
anyone that's been asking me about it
the best way to get the most out of this
out of this brand it's just go for a
consultation so in London it's in having
it's the most beautiful little salon to
go for consultation you can check them
tell them what kind of skin care regime
you want to tell them what you want to
kind of saw your face and such and they
will recommend new products and
literally obsessed my skin has never
been so good
honestly it's the best it's ever been
right now I totally hooked all I'm using
yeah partly wanted to kind of just
quickly talk about some of the comments
that I got on my last vlog but anyone
that had any care criticisms and try to
get back to
to rest I'll just let you know some what
I'm doing wrong here again Alania md
dehydration in the versatile tent
this is SPF 40 so option to focus on
these retinol every night as well you
know quite shocked because I don't often
get really negative or critical comments
but when I do I'll I want to take them
on board and see this feedback I barely
ever delete any comments on I so really
like disgusting pretty much or if it's
someone that's just looking for a site
but if anyone starts fighting with
someone else and my comments I delete
them because I think you it's not very
nice place and if you have started
fighting people are leaving nice
comments on my videos like what's your
issue one other comment about that that
they felt I wasn't doing enough hair I'm
not getting out enough I'm not showing
the real India exception things but I
wouldn't also meant that these were
primarily from British or American or
that's the same non-indian people what I
gathered from one or two comments was
that you want me to go out to capture
the poverty sign of India don't be
honest I don't know about you but all I
ever see about India is the poverty side
you see all of that in the press you see
all the bad news everything it's bad
it's happening yet so much so I to also
have an impression of India that was
based around other things because that's
all what ever shown will never shown
anything really good about India on TV
this trip I'm on I've been in to
activate our Palace Hotel groups
that's why I'm here for I'm here to see
some really incredible luxury side of
India that's the point to see the hotels
whilst also getting a lot seen a lot of
the culture going out and about seen the
tourist attractions generally getting a
really amazing impression of India and
so far it's absolutely amazing you can
say that one of my it's definitely one
of my favorite trips I've ever been on
it's completely entirely chain
view India from what I have been told
and how to grind into me with from TV
and media in the UK and everyone else on
this trip feels exactly the same
everyone is just absolutely wowed I have
had so many comments from my Indian
followers saying how much they love my
pictures how much they love my vlog how
thankful the Arthur I have not just
focused on the fact this such a poor
country in some areas that they're glad
to have seen me promoting as beautiful
incredible lavish area of India which
I'm more than happy to go and I what
that's what I wanted to do so that has
been fantastic to be back on the back of
negative feedback because some people
aren't well oh well I got a different
impression when I was there said well
the chances are that you went
backpacking around India and did it in a
very very different way I've got friends
that did that too and they loved it but
we're here to see it in a very different
way and I'm so glad I am because it's
completely opening my eyes to a very
different type of India so anyway when I
cannot do my makeup and head over to
breakfast but I really hope that kind of
clean up a few questions about on how do
they but overall having it the best time
which they won the best trip served on
India is absolutely beautiful food the
people hospitality a friendly faces I'm
honestly having to such such a good time
yeah where is he exactly breakfast he
went the gym this morning I could not
get up especially because we went to bed
at 12:00 cuz I was working and I wanted
to get up this morning for yoga at 7:00
but it just didn't happen how so so
obviously I'm too tired so Alex went to
the gym to be very very good of him I
haven't been to the gym since we got
here I'm tired all the time
oh by the way for anyone who's wondering
about my fantasy hoop earrings these are
part of Rosie's collection Rosie
Fortescue jewelry I'll leave a link down
below running hey morning I'll leave a
link to our below where you can find
them because they're so cool I don't
usually wear hoops but I really really
really like these if anybody's wondering
where my
garish shirts are from this one strong
Levi's yeah if I love that shirt did you
jump ring in Atlanta yeah I'm a bright
green one yeah

anything that's a bit flamboyant my
grass is falling dominoes with the heat

it's scorch you and I have no Sun cream
on
alex has just walked up here it's 300
steps all those girls who started not to

find him when it comes back to haunt and
this is the proper thing that is used
and then the banging and then the
finished product is is gonna be like
that take a small octopus right Simon so
this is what the finished product is
going to look like and then the stones
are in a very particular pattern which
is done by the lady surfer who would be
sitting inside these are all you know
tops or blouse pieces for a sari
I mean a really really good day we had a
tour of Hyderabad went around the fort
we did go to the tombs but didn't intend
to go to the tomb but we kind of just
ran out of time and we really wanted to
go through the market so we went to
market we brought some beautiful head
jewelry to go with our saris for later
and now we're about to have an afternoon
tea out on the low Han and play some
croquet so just got myself ready again

afternoon tea this is gorgeous

this bathroom is so cool this is really
really nice
so this one's called heart runs end in
Mumbai in Bhangra I believe the
difference with this one is that this

lovely and we have a view out over the
sea what's it's flat huh yeah forgot a
couple more days come on more days at

got an awesome tour a beautiful is this
right across the road is this
boiling consoles much height my head
because I'm gold cheer we think I really
took inside upon bed today it's really
really nice we're just wandering around
one of the houses now it was beautifully
staff it looks so colonial fine I'm
gonna love this like we seen this always
different mustaches guys I can't even
explain the heat my whole body is
covered
wet what pretty much I am roasting I
don't know why I bother just not do my
makeup this morning all my hair hello
really enjoying today so much Portuguese
influence around today which is why
everything looks quite Portuguese in
vibes
oh gosh no been so hot in my life is
that tall I was literally wringing wet
we just got back for a quick shower and
we're gonna be heading down the stairs
in the London hotel for an Indian meal
which is pull gonna be our last Indian
meal of the trip I mentioned it a few
days ago when I kind of had a bit of a
chat with the camera about the way that
India is portrayed especially over in
England for anyone who has a negative
perception of India because of what
they've seen I kind of want you to know
there's so much more for you to see to
experience here then you may even
realize I have completely fall in love
with this country this is one of my
favorite trips I've ever ever done now
cuz I know I've had a lot of Instagram
comments from people that said I never
really wanted to go to India before what
your pictures have really changed in my
mind which I which is perfect that's
kind of exactly what's out to do you
wanna take my pictures to kind of show
an area sure what it might be like give
a bit of an experience she'll feel of it
and hopefully inspire people because
that's how I get inspired for travel I
see pictures and I'm like I want to go
there because I wanna go next so that is
an amazing compliment to receive that
it's it's been a major massive I this
place is just incredibly beautiful the
people the people have totally made it
for me I think no friendly everyone's
been I mean I thought it is so so
friendly I mean I definitely want to
come back I definitely want to do Delhi
I want to I want to see more it's but
he's so big
yes huge yeah even the people are on the
streets selling food obviously they're
on a much lower income level they still
got a smile happy faces you know if that
kind of living by their means and I
didn't realise as well but everyone
pretty much speaks English here yeah it
sounds like twenty or thirty other
languages yeah streaming educated so
honestly I think this country is
wonderful
all coming to make a living for
themselves of a cure for a lot of
middle-class people naturally is a
washing machine with the fact that labor
is cheap it's far more easier to
outsource your laundry to a group of
people who'll wash arm and send it back
to you on China this is the biggest
public laundry in the world
the idea that these are all different
companies so I say to like hotels or
different companies will sell they will
send their products you wash by one of
these companies and then they bring it
here just pick up laundry
there's anything like see the people's
homes up here as well so they live and
they work please guys are watching them
all by hand there are also a lot of
machines now it will do it much much
faster
this is what people do everyday she's
doing it from my imagination
let me see
amazing
guys notice how he's putting the clot in
we're just in a fishing village look
around he's gonna show you how
[Laughter]
right I just made it back to hotel it's
been a long day absolutely amazing day
yeah today was completely unexpected
actually I had no idea we would be
visiting a larger place I don't even
realize was there or that it existed all
that those kind of places existed so
that was very eye-opening I'm so have I
kind of learned so much today from that
and visiting whirling village which is
technically classed as a Salaam by the
Indian government it was completely
unexpected I don't realize we were
visiting there today I know the day I
mentioned on Twitter this trip was very
much based around visiting the palaces
and luxurious side of India an officer
going out and visiting other places but
that the mission of this trip wasn't to
highlight the poverty and you know in
that sense because it's obviously
documented so much in the media but in a
way I'm so glad that I did get to
experience that today because obviously
it was extremely eye-opening an
absolutely amazing experience thing for
all of us we were all obviously very
touched by it seeing it firsthand so it
was nothing like what I had ever
imagined it to be like the people were
so friendly so you know so kind of
almost welcoming they wanted to solve
show us their homes and their village
they were you know they weren't in any
way hostile they weren't like we didn't
feel unsafe or anything like that like
he kind of made to feel it would be
every was so lovely and constantly like
little kids floor always want to say
hello and get pictures with us and it
was so cute yeah so it's it's it's been
an absolutely incredible day I've
learned a lot from today and I won't I
won't ever forget this day going to get
ourselves right now gonna go for some
drinks and our very last evening in
India we are at the end of our meal
we're in house
inside the Lampson hotel and let's just
arrived chocolate cookie pudding okay
Carrie you're gonna dip it and see what
it's like in the middle more business
