today one Chester and I've got a couple
of meetings to go to and then I'm going
down to London I've been invited to a
called different events one with
Claire's accessories that's tonight I
think that an amazing hotel stop in the
Royal Horse Guards hotel that's on
embankment opposite the Thames and
apparently my room has a view of the
London Eye so I'm so excited so I can
show you all of that and then tomorrow
I'm going to a breakfast with Lee
Stafford and his team and some other
bloggers and then I've got some meetings
after that and then I becoming home so I
thought I'd bring you along with me
again so if you want to see what I get
up to the next day and a half then keep
watching
Melanie's make a penny collection is so
cute
these earrings something else
in London on the exercise some champagne
even talking to some more bloggers and
okay oh my gosh I've just been shown
around by the concierge to my hotel room
and it's absolutely stunning it's got
this it looks like a little prison
marie-claire and they've left me a
little treat
how gorgeous is this this is kill we can
put your iPod in here and it will play
through the entire room you can choose
to watch the TV in the bath which is
just insane in fact let's have a look at
the view because I haven't haven't seen
what the view looks like that's happy
this is just insane I can't believe this
hotel me wish I was like here longer to
like enjoy it more but Wow
so I order myself some pate and massive
chicken up on say so and I might
absolute eat myself as well something
out of the minibar
who's next morning I woke up in this
amazing in size bed just kind of like
sprawled across all the sheets it was
and it's the most beautiful day in
London look how pretty is it's so
beautiful and again the view is just
superb so it's got to do my nails and
then I'm going to get I have a car but
that's going to take me to this
apartment in Soho to meet Lee Stafford
apparently you've cooking those
breakfast meet some of the bloggers and
some of the press so that should be cool
and I'll try remember to film as well
say

I'm gonna run another play but let's go
really a lot of fifth day I didn't know
101 your page and my mom this is a time
when we find each other exactly
proprietary site Oh Scott if I'm always
check for outing me around and just one
thing she said somebody you know what
would my hair and that was he I just
wanna play me straight yeah but quite
complete challenge but you know I mean
talk about being my best because you
know the minute I started doing it you
know I just fell in love with it for so
many different reasons and I've never
felt like I've done of those work in my
life you know
the only times I love you too Susan I
would always young girl sponge he'll be
more you know the more in stars the
Scythians why do the things that signs
actually doing the question maybe
because most of the time you know so
it's a boo thing especially proving that
toilet is pretty
um goodbye yeah looking forward so
that's gonna be fun
I'm also just starting up so you have no
passion there nothing that's where I'm
really gonna focus my energy and it's
five years I've got and of course the
Brian I mean that's you know that's my
probably like you know biggest products

work very hard on bringing innovative
new products to the market yeah

invited into the dress and renewing
myself for it for I cannot fix a sharp
recession so let's try it on a million
different outfit into five gorgeous
pieces like two jacket dress tops yeah
but it's so cute in here I'll shrink it
magazines it's just really really nice
hello

finish off this vlog because I'm just
about to go out to a friend's wedding so
I thought I'd show you what I'm wearing
and so this dress is from Little Miss
dress I got this about eight months ago
I just know had an event to work for and
it's so beautiful
little bummed out princess dress and
then I'm wearing so misguided wedges
which I thought went really really
nicely and it's a little bit edgy really
jewelry like my Olivia purse and watch
some pearls and I just kind of left my
hair to kind of kill dry and then gone
through it with a few more and curls
using my new curling wand I'm ecstatic
