whole octave ages so I'm back with a
vlog finally today is extremely exciting
because I'm on the way to Barcelona out
from a very festival with my one of my
best work what she does with Nana hey
that's one of my oldest friends we went
to primary school together didn't we
together as well just okay well yeah
primary school together so she's my
oldest friend I've been invited along
with Levi eyes which as you probably
know is a brand that I love anyway I
wear their Devon jacket to death but the
cool thing about this trip is that
they've allowed me to kind of customize
it to the way that I would want to go
away and have like an awesome trip so
taxi to get to the airport going on a
British Airways flight we're going to
prove here at a festival I just thought
it was a pretty cool chilled out first
of all I just wanted to go somewhere
that was just a bit more of a kind of
laid-back chilled out vibe and Levi has
made it happen so I'm really really
excited
Levi's invite him into their new tailor
shop were you allowed to customize
anything which was super cool
so I went in early of the day and hard a
pair of 501 jeans customized into shops
with turn ups and I had little vista's
patil over one pocket and I had a V
patch but on the other pocket and I had
them all ripped up afraid so totally
personalized and then I also chose a
white shirt that I had frayed along all
the edges and a collar just to add much
more of a vintage feel
taxis just about to arrive so better get
going
we're just in the taxi to the airport
we're almost there
I think you look good for time we have a
really good time really good for time
and we're up so starving now so we're
gonna go get some breakfast I'm thinking
something like a bacon cheese give me
any kind of thing you know I like a lot
yeah
hi guys dis arrived in only show up like
a sec nothing too strenuous so
the drinks and then get ready and then
I'm going to go up to the best
so finally he took a district in fire
here
oh nice look at that view
oh isn't that isn't that what good
festival is over there that is a view
Wow
okay so on our way to the festival and
Levi's told us we could get there in any
way you wanted to so we decided we were
gonna go for roller skate road blades
although they're not told me she'd never
ever elevate you in their entire life so
they turned out to be quite difficult
boys on the fun I'll run our way now to
the festival I'm gonna get some food
then hope it does
what show
finally finally
guys let's see it work back from the
festival back to the room although we
can still hear the music so loud so God
knows how we're going to sleep it was
just so much fun to be able to kind of
customize my own experience I mean that
was the kind of whole point that really
Levi's wanted me to be able to customize
my own full day so I said I wanted to go
to her a very festive office for the
chilled out called time I said I wanted
to kind of do some cool things I'm not
done before such as getting rollerblades
and go rollerblading along the promenade
eating crepes but festival ice creams
and I wanted to kind of dance and just
soften really enjoy myself and they made
all happen for me so it was absolutely
incredible the outside war absolutely
loved I totally love this white shirt
with all of its of fraying along the
edges and the top and obviously my
customized shops from the Levi's tailor
shop so awesome outfits are really
enjoyed wearing that today and it was
fun does it spend time with now as well
cuz I don't get so much time together so
that was a service that fun so thank you
so much Levi's for setting this up for
me and allowing me to go away and just
have this cool personalized experience I
had at the best time so I really really
hope you all enjoyed watching if you did
