all doing so well so last week I was in
LA I was at VidCon and I didn't really
film anything there but I did buy things
so I thought it'd be the perfect time to
show you some of the things I picked up
in America they were mainly from Sephora
I went a little bit spendy and brought
some new things that had my eye on and
also I had a few meetings while I was
out there and I got some beautiful new
clothing pieces I thought I'd show you
those as well so let's just get to it
when I start off with Sephora because
I'm super excited about this bag of
treats let's just get into this so first
of all I bought myself a brand new
Beauty Blender as you probably know
these like my like Holy Grail item I
can't do my makeup without these now
especially for concealer and foundation
to make it much more flawless this is
kind of my go-to I do also rule out the
Real Techniques blending sponge but for
many Beauty blunder I don't know very
very similar products base for the real
love this I thought pick up a brand new
one and I like the one in the pink this
is what I went for I cannot wait to
start using this while I was out there
and I was walking around the till
section that area is just a nightmare
because I just go a bit crazy and like
take this I'll take this and I saw this
it's the Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray the long-lasting gwon and
it's literally one of my favorite
products for setting and I bought one of
these last time I was in America and I'm
almost all the way through the bottle so
I thought it's time to me pick up
another one but it's just a really easy
travel size companion there's a cute
little bottle fits right into makeup bag
it's a little bit smaller than the
normal size one so I thought I'd just
pick up another one and as do all this
product so much the product everyone
seems to rave about is the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer and I have tried it
but I had the wrong color I had a really
really dark one so I picked up the
lighter shade and this comes as a tiny
little try on again this was around the
tills
I was pulled in by this and this is just
in light shade so it looks so much
better for me so when honestly I haven't
even tried this yet oh yeah that looks
perfect my kind of skin tone so I'm
really excited to try this people rave
about how much they adore this so
looking for trying out how cute is this
version so if I really like this small
version I'd probably go for larger one
but for like my purse and my handbag and
taking this around for like top-ups
it's quite a cool little travel size
well hello
Becca and Jaclyn hill like literally I
lost champagne pop in the powder and I
saw Suzy from hello October had got this
I think she has it saw something similar
and I absolutely love the more light
colored version of this anyway very
similar product so because I love
champagne pop so much I felt I needed to
try this too
this is like an under foundation
illuminator the skin Perfector liquid
sort of shimmer and it's in the
champagne pop version so it's much more
kind of shiny champagne rose gold tint
so I'm going to try this out and smooth
my foundation and maybe even mix it in
with foundation if I want an ultra glow
and also you can use a soft pad onto
your cheekbones and get that kind of
glow going so I'm really excited about
this it was wasn't well it was quite
pricey but I'm sure I'm gonna love it so
we'll see what the fact that I saw this
area I was like oh my god I need it more
highlighters everyone's been going on
about this glow kit from Anastasia
Beverly Hills so I felt like I needed it
too this is the that glow version which
I felt had better shades in it for me
really I really wish this had a mirror I
feel it needs a mirror but anyway
sunburst golden bronze Buble I'm
dripping in gold and they look like
really great highlighters for me but
they're so incredibly pigmented I saw it
was like wowza
I need this in my life gorgeous so yeah
I had to get it this was most pricey
item this was like $45 I think but I
thought I'd loved it so I thought I'd
give that a go
give it a whirl I will let you know how
I got on this probably on Instagram and
the next three products the last three
products are my favorite kind of
products ever liquid lips so in the
moment I am obsessed with Anastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lips so I picked up
another tick because the Anaheim Sephora
has loads of products left usually
they're so so about but they had quite a
lot left and they were the nude colors
so I literally now own every single
nudes anastasia beverly hills dolls just
to make sure i have the one health
I mean you know you know what women can
be like sometimes so I went for these
two we've got stripped and we've got
naked now looking at these this is more
of a move Newt it's got more kind of
hazy stony tones this one is a little
bit more coral but barely coral but you
know a bit more orange toned it is a bit
more kind of movi tones so this is a
more muted and this has a little bit
more color to it so naked has more color
but they're both beautiful the one I
wear the most I mean the one I've got on
my lips now is actually Kat Von D
bow-and-arrow with Anastasia Beverly
Hills pure Hollywood over the top this
makeup you either seen already or you'll
be seeing next in my everyday makeup
routine so have a look at that if you
like what I'm wearing on my face I
thought I'd get these two as well and
they're really made great I'd probably
say that stripped is my favorite out
with the two and then I often wear crush
as well which is even more move and a
deep nude but I thought I'd get those
the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid lips
generally are not overly drying I mean
after a while you might need to put a
bit of gloss on or a little bit of balm
on just kind of rehydrate your lips but
they're not just by the Sun at drying
out your lips
I don't think especially if you use some
propylene just put a very light coat on
and don't like lacquer up and lock her
up or else you could let your own be
like stuck together but otherwise I
absolutely love them to bits
I love the matte lock the moment forgot
those and then as I was speaking about
this is a Kat Von D bow and arrow which
I picked up and I've been wearing
non-stop ever since so this again is
more this is much more Brown so if you
see these two more nudie this is much
more brownstone Brown kind of shade but
I really want to try some a little bit
deeper and like I said this is kind of
it with pure Hollywood over the top but
it's absolutely beautiful
it's so easy to put on it's almost like
the doe foot applicator doesn't get too
much product on it before you put it on
it just goes on super easily I mean the
packaging is gorgeous
on these as well yeah totally in love
with this it's very very similar
consistency I find to Anastasia as well
which would be my favorite consistency
may be honest Asia only does it by a
tiny bit but they're both beautiful
so that was messy for Hall just as an
idea all of that cost me about $200
but there were things I really really
wanted so I'm super excited about Lamar
right okay and a few bits of clothes I
just wanted to quickly show you how
beautiful is this new triangle set I
mean I adore triangle if you see my
Instagram you'll know that I wear quite
a lot of triangle when I'm away just
because we fit really really nicely as
an idea sizes I always go for small on
the bottoms because they do have this
very neoprene fabric which means that
they're a little bit tighter
I found the normal so small fits me
almost like a 6 to 8 UK normally would
this is the print and then the top is a
triangular bikini top shape but that
fits me really nicely and that again is
in a small so that fits me absolutely
fine
sometimes go fetch a smile sometimes go
for small in these but this is pretty
perfect for me so I got those and then
the other things I got were from revolve
clothing which you probably know I loved
bits I wish so much of their products
and I went in to have a meeting with
them in LA cuz I've got a beautiful
social club there just like a big
showroom so they let me go around and
pick some pieces to take home which was
so generous of them and so lovely so I
picked a couple of nice summery pieces
first up is this dress I've worn a few
times now you may have seen on Instagram
so pretty this is by Tularosa which is
one of the revolve brands and it's just
a very beautiful lacy duck head green
blue shade that goes down into a mini
dress but it's really pretty Bardot
style with all the lace so just fits
like this very very cute I love that two
pieces this is about 130 pounds in the
UK to buy I try and leave links down
below to everything here by the way
the next thing how pretty is this dress
got this almost cut out lacy effect
overlaid over a white backing so it's
not you see-through and again it just
goes down into a dress at the bottom
like a lacy scalloped edging but it's
very pretty how it has this right which
way is forward lets us check so this is
the front it has a slight keyhole to the
very front here your arms go through
here
this goes around your neck I'll insert a
picture on the screen for you to be able
to see what looks like on the model but
it's just very very pretty very flirty
perfect for holidays so I picked up that
and the last thing a lot of you will
probably really love because it has
pineapples on it and pineapples are big
currently and it's this place ooh
so this is quite a cool really unique
place ooh and now it houses cut out in
the middle where you can tie the central
pieces like two cutouts this goes around
your bust then this kind of ties around
the middle of you and then it goes down
into the shorts at the bottom so it's
like a little play suit romper very
sweet again I'll attach a picture of the
rumpert and you can go along to the
website and that's it some more pictures
I would show you how it looks like on
but you might miss a tail and kind of in
a bit of a hurry I'm about to go out and
watch Beyonce and I don't have much time
so I'm very sorry but I really want to
the film is for you so I'm sorry that
can't rise on belief there just so you
can see yeah very very cute I got this
in extra small size and this is from a
brand again from revolve called privacy
clean very very cute indeed oh and the
last thing actually I am wearing looks
like I'm very naked actually on this
camera it real-life so this is the last
piece it's a kind of denim chambray blue
jumpsuit and it ties on the back it's
gonna find my bra tighter on the back
zips up the back here ties my cute
little bow and it goes down it goes down
into very long almost a little bit wide
legs again I'll put a picture on screen
you can see but I absolutely love this
jumpsuit I wore it in LA from the
parties and got so many compliments I
feel almost like where did you get that
jumpsuit from so it's from revolve I'll
leave a link again down below for you so
you can go and have a look but this is
definitely my favorite piece I picked up
it's just really cozy and comfortable
and easy to wear and I'll know hour
where it's so much over summer so that's
everything for this America haul I hope
