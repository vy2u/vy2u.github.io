good we sat here filming like I'll put
all of my cuff links and the setup
together I felt like it must have been
weeks since I sat down to film this
video especially as recently as I've
been doing one video a week just because
I've been so busy and trying to focus
more on my blog and the things that are
going on I'm not quite have enough time
to film so it means I'm sitting down
here less and on the lower altitudes
comes video so it is startled really
really nice today doing this whole
various video for you I'm sorry I'm so
late but because I have my Sri Lanka
trip and a maldis trip and then the Cuba
trip I had a few videos that I kind of
like to get out before a favorites video
because I'll enjoy kind of keep it
timely to when they happened so if
you've not seen those videos I really
hope you've seen them already if not
I'll leave links on the screen also down
below you can watch maestro Lanka cares
look books cool vibe kind of video and
also the somalis video it's more like a
day in a life and against but hours
hours now I'm filming this video so I
really hope you like that but this is my
chatting from our chilled and just me
and you and we're going to go through my
favourites of April and office it up
until now which is our half way through
May so it's quite a lot to get through
I think today we'll start off with hair
actually I think I mentioned before
about the red can mega masks but these
are also changing my life and pretty
early for like brand new to red care
they're just really great on fat protein
masks they really help strengthen the
hair so they make it so super soft I've
never felt a mask like it I use it
everytime now that I wash my hair which
about every four five days I just
slather it on throughout five minutes
take it off an answer the texture and
condition of my hair has never been so
good as it is recently with this we
obviously use in conjunction with the
collecting magnetics shampoo as well for
shampoo I don't even really bother with
condition anymore I just goes through it
into a mask to be honest you probably
shouldn't do conditioners well know
they're going to do but generally this
go straight for the mask and I love this
combo so much but I do have to give a
bit of a shout out to my other favorite
which I've mentioned before the L'Oreal
Paris
alvey's lotion shampoo this is my one
and only when I go away
so moldy Sri Lanka Cuba Tuscany
everywhere I've been I obviously I don't
take big kind of bottles away with me
with all my different things I
take this one and only bottle with me
because it's a shampoo conditioner one
again it makes my hair super soft it's
easy to use if your hair similar links
to mine then you play about 15 points
list in your hand all over give it a
quick of a massage in and wash it out
dawn hair love it okay I don't know why
this is taking me so long to come into
my collection but listen for Kiel for
midnight recovery concentrate I'm sure
I've heard one of my besties and she'll
she's here on YouTube as well
she loves heels and she loves this and
for some reason I've never really had it
in my routine until now this is really
changing my skin the moment I've had a
blemish here on my cheek for about a
year now it just hasn't gone this is not
been healing and this is me the biggest
difference I can see it's now really
started to go away from my face and the
rest of my face all the under skin
blemishes that I've had recently and my
skin was a bit rubbish a few weeks ago
this is a lot of the skin kind of like
system wasn't great and honest service
is making the biggest difference I don't
do my skin now at night without this I
just plug it onto my hands and really
pass it in and kind of massage it a
little bit into my skin and then I go in
with my moisturizer over the top love it
a bit I'll be repurchasing this over and
over I believe for the near future but I
get Vanessa Oh since you out yes I've
got nothing else on that odor puffer
yeah it's absolutely beautiful oh this
is such a stunning fragrance I'm sure
it's got a kind of like rose in there
it's also quite fresh and floral it's
not too fruity it's somewhat sweet not
overly sweet it's just a very wearable
feminine fragrance and the under notes
from quite erm citrusy as well oh it's
just beautiful it's so beautiful and
it's little bottle is gorgeous as well
I'm really love how simple it is this
cute little ribbon around it in the pink
I think it's a gorgeous honestly give
this a try if you are in a Persian store
look out with the tag of Vanessa
I honestly recommend this and let
something new that's just come out it's
from Chanel is the hydrant how do you
can't yes look exactly that's the French
this is a four sighing
replenishing hydration cream I guess but
we're talking about this oh so it's got
a little tiny beads in it which going to
pop I'm sure you have chamomile in them
it's just so refreshing on the skin it's
beautiful to me
it really sinks into the skin makes it
feel so hydrated and moisturize but
still leaves this lovely plump top the
looks of skin like it looks like it has
moisturizer
kind of on it if that makes any sense
it's wonderful I love on to new
foundation because I feel it as much
more kind of moister into my foundation
and makes it more dewy which I love and
oh yeah heinie Ricky mango cream
completely mess up name there but
honestly it's beautiful absolute
beautiful third big fave I feel it's
been a long time since I mentioned a
powder mainly because I don't really use
that many powders on my face generally
because my skin is somewhat dry and I
don't really like adding too many
pounders I generally will just add it
underneath my under eye to set the
concealer so that my mascara doesn't
transfer down so this is the Clarins
pore perfecting mattifying kit suicide
of here you've got that it's really cute
how it opens as well I like that it's
got this little powder try like a
transparent translucent powder it has a
sponge and in here at have some blotting
papers now I don't usually use them
credit they have oil in our skin so
that's great for anyone that can needs
that so you can I got this full light
mattifying kit which i think is so good
and offer half a mirror but this powder
itself is so brilliant
it doesn't cake it just almost like your
skin to set up as a look and it takes in
without looking cakey or like your even
got anything on it takes away all shine
entirely honestly it's really really
good I have to mention it oh and a lip
gloss of choice recently now I'm not
usually prof. kind of gal but this is
your strategies mate I absolutely adore
it it's so great it's a discreet nude
shade Estee Lauder and the thing about
this it's a little bit of shimmer in
there it's nude but if I'm like a
champagne nude so it doesn't just add a
glossy Sheen as a little bit cooler too
it's not really sticking I have it on
now the fine just adds like a lighter
tone to lips or make them really turn
glossy and shiny not too sticky I think
it's fantastic
I really look formulation look how it
makes my lips look big firm and before I
moved into a few products that I really
want to mention in terms of things I've
just started using and I think are new
and exciting just to be freshly bit I
have to give out a mention again to
these shoes you may see these a lot in
Instagram pictures and also I've
mentioned before in a video but honestly
I knew our
get a lot of use out of these and I
obviously have so far I've worn them so
much in Sri Lanka in the Maldives these
are so comfortable the fabric is just so
durable and robust I just love them I
think this is such an incredible shoe
and I'll probably have the news for as
long as my feet day aside for just a
couple of fashion E bits to mention
first off this beautiful swimsuit from
Tyler Hilfiger me night seal it looks a
little bit like the coke sign it's got a
bit of a retro crook cool design to it
in a way it's kind of designed really
love it though in the red navy blue
piping around the outside trying a
little Tommy Hilfiger flag here and then
he'll forget to the front it has got
that very retro Baywatch inside to it
when you wear it it's just quite
flattering
I felt really covered up in this so I
don't feel like it's showing too much my
skin or being too revealing
until wearing it oh it's been a while
since I showed you anything
self-portrait and I'm so excited to show
you guys this
so it's self portrait have brought back
a couple of their most sort of famous
dresses I feel like these dresses were
what really kind of started
self-portrait on the whole like growth
spurt that they went through I never
really got my hands on them before but
they brought out a few about the classic
colors again and I thought you know what
I need to kind of get one of classic
shapes and with me going away I thought
it'd be the perfect opportunity to get
one so I was for the baby blue it's on a
nude backing and the news goes all the
way down to a miniskirt so then the rest
of the dress is like this we can show my
leg better and loose with some very
flattering shape extremely feminine lacy
beautiful fits really really well not
much more I can say
I absolutely love it so leave links down
below where you can get that obviously
with everything else it's in the
favorites of course and the last piece I
wanted to mention is this beautiful
sauce a salmon red pink stunning dress
it's one of those dresses that needs
lining a lot though only if she would
take on holiday so I take a mini steamer
with you our little mini Travel line if
you did buy this and your six holiday
but it's just so stunning and I wore
this in Cuba and just lots of pretty and
it's floaty and it was perfect
for myself so dancing lessons that I did
and actually really good nearly on were
partnered and we killed it the people
that were teaching this after all loved
of we would have so into it and I wore
this and
pretty net if you have bigger boobs than
me you probably love this more because
your boobs will fill out the dress a
little bit more and it will feel like
they're going to come out as much with
little bit
it fits I'm totally fine it looks lovely
my only worry was that I would keep
looking down and let is - well you know
that kind of feeling but it has bigger
boobs it was filled out more and would
have felt small in place
I feel so what I did was I walked very
beautiful light-colored bralette that I
have like non non wired it's just really
cutesy as water underneath and then I
saw the top so you could just view this
really pretty lace coming at the top it
looks really really good so that's
another idea if you are a bit worried
about having chemic cleavage or you'll
be flipping out and finish off I'm just
going to go through a few products I'm
pretty excited about quite a few about
you to put on my face as well so I'll be
have to show you how they kind of work -
what we're going to start with okay
first up there is the Estee Lauder kind
of bronze goddess summer line they come
out with a beautiful line every suit
this looks like a little CD vinyl -
every year we come out with incredible
summer palette range are some aligned
and this is this year soon as I saw it I
was like oh my god what is this opens up
to a beautiful big palette just used it
for this look so this is a blush which
I'm wearing now drilling color almost is
very kind of coral eyes a bit bronzy
just a pretty Kasimir flush and these
three are eyes shadows so the champagne
kind of like a deep aqua blue and a more
chocolate color awesome are shimmery and
quite kind of and catch the light
beautiful is and also have a big mirror
so it's such a crazy little palette I've
used all three so I've used to be
champagne all over my lid I also use the
bush shade in my crease this comes warm
up a little bit then right in with the
chocolate and the grease and then I use
the blue as like a liner if you can
assert part of blue love it it's really
beautiful the pigmentation isn't crazy
like you're on different disciplinary
Ryan Billa girl it's too much product
but beautiful buildable and if you top
packet on works wonders the blushes
excuse is pigmented they're just a
little bit of this kind of went a long
way so big big France that and that also
comes with the most insane highlighter
oh my god
check that out it seems like openness
else with Alex not like babe oh my god
this is so shimmery and I mean I'm
wearing it now if you're wondering what
this mega pop of sunshine is on my
cheeks right now is this absolute
beautiful design it's like a big Sun and
it's just a big mixture of bronzy goals
and oh my god is so brainy it's actually
yeah
estee lauder have killed it for summit
let's just say that some newbies from
zoeva the Weaver it is kind of slaying
the game recently I feel they're making
some incredible products first one is
the basic moment palette beautiful
shades and here lots of beautiful
neutrals these are all matte down the
side and leave it all shimmer so it's a
really great palette take around I
really do wish that Zoe would start
putting mirrors inside of their palettes
though that's the one drawback how
scientists so we've a pallet otherwise
these are kind of my go-to
I throw these into my holiday bags or
into I'm going away for a weekend or
whatever I always kind of take a little
so we've pellet with me because the
pigmentation is always amazing we always
have great colors just it needs a mirror
you need a mirror Zoe Weaver okay and
that also comes with a basic moment the
lush palette which I must say I'm pretty
excited about this this baby pink almost
a bit coral tone blush is totally me
this in the middle is more of a wow gold
highlight very similar sized Estee
Lauder not quite as yellow gold and then
a bronzer so I'm also a big fan of this
kind of thing going away do I need a
grungy highlight any blush in one
palette what more could you want
we've got some newbies as well from
Chanel how to mention if I use this for
you guys on camera this is a brand new
Chanel libbers in cushion format I love
it it just feels a bit different this
isn't like all the cushions are dry
there's something about this fabric it's
not like a mesh like some of the
cushions are it just feels like a little
pillow
almost like a little bouncy trampoline
below gorgeous this is in shape 30
thought for me I'm not tanned at all at
the moment and for me it was a really
great shade I've got all over big big
file actually extremely Jimmy this is my
kind of foundation to a team it's a very
good light to medium coverage what the
doing is from this is so gorgeous
and it's
really illuminating and really
brightening and it's yes it's my kind of
foundation right contractor Luigi with
skin lock this is also in the range this
is the living healthy glow luminous
color and there's a couple different
shades of this and inside is a sort of
ribbed powder and they get dark from
darker so you could have one more to
Brunn's but this is more of a kind of
very light brown shade I used it more as
a powder and a sort of whisk all over
mainly where I've put bronzer but also
all over I really loved it for that so
if my next trips were a bit more tanned
this will be great all over colors all
over powder but the actual dark shades
of this are also filling and then it
from Armani you also always bring out
incredible from a collection this is so
pretty and it's their spring summer 2017
palette they always bring out one of
these every year and they're always sold
out amazing so this is kind of a fabric
that was used in the show this was part
of the show that I went to as well for
this fabric on clothing so they always
put on top of the pallets will get
gorgeous and it comes with two different
sections the first one is a bronzer
which I am wearing today really
wonderful deep color bronze but nothing
too heavy or too dark smade beautiful
really bronzer shade though and then
underneath that I have in there and then
underneath that are three beautiful
shape again that were totally from the
runway collection they were using this
gorgeous blue shade backstage for the
models on the eyes so you've got the
gorgeous blue shade you've got a black
and also a very pretty rosy that
champagne you really actually just very
very wearable so the blue again you
could use if I could either eyeliner
shade I could go all out and be brave
and go for a full look with that it
comes with two brushes so I think these
little palette is it is sexuals a little
trouble kits and just great spread in
your makeup bag during the day as well
so I use those and as always I think
it's a wonderful oh and the last things
to mention lipsticks so two lovely
ladies I know has just collaborated with
Mac and brought out their own lipstick
shades I mean what an absolute dream
come true when I heard about this whole
collaboration I was like you're joking
every makeup lover's dream come true
would be to make a MAC lipstick exactly
how they
on it so for two ladies we have
Alexandra Alexandra Stein her from llama
she is the beauty editor for Kelowna and
she's also on a sassiest woman I know
she's amazing
so she has brought out her shade which I
am wearing now and I lost who's kind of
a nudie rose
I feel like a nude Rose it has those
always pink tones in there but it's
still got quite a deep nude shades
nothing to light very very wearable for
every single day and if you see pictures
on her Instagram for wearing mesh she
asset kill this which they have perfect
shade I'll leave her Instagram link down
below but then we have slur so flirty
fourth also got to make her own and I
mean that's quite similar they both
companies or some new ladies like myself
this one is a cream machine and this
Aleksandras is a luster lipstick so
close it's more of a nudie deep beige
and our Sanders is a rosy nude and
they're both absolutely gorgeous so
massive congrats to flirt and to Alex
for this because it that's a huge like
what a collaboration to do and I'm very
excited I'm gonna leave it that guys I
