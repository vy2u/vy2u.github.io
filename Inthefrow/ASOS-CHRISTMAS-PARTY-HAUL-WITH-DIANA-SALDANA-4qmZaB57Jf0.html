somewhere now if not down below
she is amazing she's just the most
incredible makeup tutorial even a
Russian home thank you I love yours
thank you and we're going to glean party
tomorrow so Diana it's over for a few
days in the UK so I kind of snatched her
up and I was like we have to film yeah I
think I'm so excited so we're gonna go
through some kind of really cool
Christmas party outfit so we both went
on the ACS website and we picked out so
many items for like holiday parties and
things we think you guys would really
enjoy to pick out so we both picked a
few bits and now we're gonna go through
and show you everything that we really
loved yeah let's do this
okay so much to shape okay maybe this
the sparkly ones me I love sparkling hot
clothes it's just kind of happy yeah
okay so the first one we picked out was
this beautiful sequins dress and this is
for the girl who loves to dress out who
love Sparkle who love sequins and is not
afraid to like just go although it is
pretty short so if you do like showing
your legs I feel like you would really
love this and then on the back is
gorgeous cowl neck back isn't it yeah
it's so beautiful and the color is
really stunning as well beautiful fabric
yeah
this Montek glitzy option yes love that
this is something that I would
personally wear actually tomorrow
morning a gold sequins dress oh yeah I
think you would actually look incredible
in this dress
thank you people this dress is more for
the girl who likes to kind of go all out
super party girl loves to go to the
clubs let's go for it dance I love this
this is so much fun yeah it is the super
fun is just a little bit kind of short a
little bit more kind of skin on show but
you know you can always throw a jacket
on some amazing heels and just work it I
feel or you can like a faux fur like a
dark faux fur so cute that would be
gorgeous
actually yeah just like sparkly the
little stuff and the glitter and sequins
it's just super festive phone
I love doggy it's super cute this one's
so gorgeous I love the material
I love the cutouts I love the length I
feel like this is for the girl who wants
to dress up who wants to look a little
bit more on the dressy classic side yeah
and I just really love how it looks what
do you have in gorgeous I think it's
midday from what I remember from the
pictures about midnight isn't it so some
amazing like taller ankle heals look
incredible with this and like could wear
like nude bag or even just go for like a
silver bag yes and then like some silver
accessories yeah it's doing even better
self-portrait as well definitely really
wide enough to and this one sold out so
quickly too like we had to like quickly
order it because yeah it was gone
so we'll obviously leave links down
below to everything in this so hopefully
it's back and stuff it's so pretty let's
move on to this one because this is
something that I would like to
personally wear tomorrow today yeah
right now no something it's like a body
con meaty dress as well I feel like
meaty dresses are like everything
especially for the holidays but this one
just really hugs your body and the
cutouts just make it really sexy and it
goes up to your neck look my really your
neck but it has a high neck and it just
looks so stunning yeah it'd be gorgeous
and again I mean what would you read
this maybe like new teals white nude
heõs white heels okay what you should
show the pants with that box you think
I'm dying over it yeah I know it may be
okay so I thought for the girl who isn't
really into dresses as I know quite a
lot you guys are often saying you don't
really like wearing dresses so I found
this insane die it's so gorgeous
listen I have to keep this it's funny
amazing so it's a beautiful so heavily
embellished so many kind of colors like
nudes and blues and a bit of kind of its
kind of like a duck egg backing isn't
it's the mesh and in the back is that
completely open so it's quite sexy very
hard yeah it's gorgeous so I thought
this
would look amazing with these Samos
purple silky shiny gently of this color
it's so different and it's not something
that people will like normally gravitate
towards yeah but like when you put it
together just it stands out and it looks
more dressy so I love it
yeah and with this kind of fabric it
kind of looks more festive it's more
silky it's more shiny and those two
together though I'm just hopefully in
love with this outfit I mean I love it
you need to keep that one
so we also picked out this one and I
love the details on this dress I love
the mush I love that it's like a little
bit more covered up so if you don't like
showing a lot of skin then I feel like
this will be something you really like
and it's something similar to
self-portrait as well but more
affordable so yes you're getting the
best of both worlds yeah and the clouds
no lace and it's just yeah if you prefer
to wear black I'm not really into color
this would be such a good option perfect
for you arms as well and the arms are
just make it so sexy too gorgeous and
the very last one again it's a bit of a
different choice it's darker colors
again so nothing too out there but I
felt that the little velvet details made
it a little bit so gorgeous and the
fringe on this yes it's super cute so
it's kind of bummed out so you can
actually like have your shoulders
exposed which just make it even sexier I
think it's really cute without being
overly Christmassy I feel that you could
just throw on a pair of like glittery
silver heels with this and a lovely
silver bag and it would just make it a
little bit more
I love yes so that you could wear it all
year round otherwise
so we also picked out some shoes for you
guys and these are actually my favorite
because you can literally wear them with
anything and everything and silver is so
beautiful and these actually have like
crystals in front like lace up which are
my favorite yeah that's so pretty
so easily wearable as well and so nice
for the festive period not too much
bling but still silver you could wear it
with so much but then still have that
little bit of sparkle yeah very subtle
but still like it's a statement shoe so
if you want to go to more of a black
option I thought these were really three
it's about the purse
he'll at the moment I've seen a lot of
perspex heels but on the kind of light
designer she was recently so that's kind
of cool and then it just kind of
attaches around your ankle to kind of
keep your ankle and the ranch which is
nice it's just very simple but in the
perspex heel it's just I feel people
would comment on these shoes and
compliment them because they're quite
sweet and they're really quite
affordable as well I thought it was
super cute if you prefer more of a black
choice and the last ones I just sees
really cute rose gold shoes I love the
nice black heels are a little bit
different everything else but with this
kind of color you could wear it in a lot
of different ways it'll just kind of
catch the light just have that little
bit of festive feel there's so much fun
and the black heel just makes it so much
more comfortable so much more
comfortable if you want to go dancing
then these would be a really really good
choices yeah and we also got this little
cute clutch in fact that would look
really good with the nude dress from
before oh yeah like the bodycon dress
yeah this is just a like a clutch you
can literally wear with anything to a
holiday party and I just love the
crystals that's why I picked it out yeah
it's everything guys I really really
