soft unboxing video one of my favorite
things to film and also one of your
favorite things to watch so hope you
like this one just as much this one's
going to be all about a sausage new
party where ranges for all the Christmas
so anything for Christmas parties
Christmas meals out at bars and
restaurants or even Christmas Day
Christmas Eve hopeless will have you
covered so as always I went on to the a
sauce website had a look at all the part
where and chose six outfits that thought
that you guys might really really like
and I might really like for my Christmas
to those always I'm just going to unbox
everything now show you every single
piece and then at the very end of the
video that's when we're going to do the
triops we can see everything pieced
together and style together so make sure
you stick around for that and I don't
need to say this but all the links will
be down below in the description bar we
can click through to a sauce and buy all
of these pieces since all so let's get
right into it I'm going to start off
with the shoes I picked up these little
cuties these reminded me of Manolo
Blahniks with the big embellished
encrusted gems on the front this is also
in a black velvet so very on-trend for
the moment and also not too high of a
heel I know some of you guys don't
really like the high heel so I thought
I'd give you an alternative it's a bit
lower and these are really quite
comfortable as well I had a little try
on already these ones are a little bit
more sexy lovely pointed toe much taller
heels is probably like 6 7 8 inch heel
he really reminded me of Christian
Louboutins so I thought these would be a
lovely affordable version and also
really like the croc print as well all
over and also down heel so I thought
these would look so sexy with so many
different outfits these were too
adorable to miss how cute with these
little pom-poms I never had an issues
like this before
and the pink blush champagne satin all
over the body of the shoe is really
classy and cute as well so I thought
these would go with outfits just to make
it a little bit more feminine and cutesy
and also quite festive with the furry
faux fur little pom-poms my shoes are
these these are almost like a shoe boot
heel hit on it
isn't too tall though maybe again male
six-inch heel but because your entire
ankle is kept inside of the boot it
feels a lot more secure on your feet
when you're walking around the little
tie but you can get into the back of the
shoe via the zips so you won't always
have to keep untying them and I sort
these would go with so many different
outfits for party season I also picked
up this faux fur wrap which is from Risa
a sauce I really love the colors in it
the silvers and the blacks I thought
that it would be really nice just to
sort of throw on over any dress you clip
it together it's got some little button
there is little button you can clip it
together or you can just wear it around
your arms really kind of Hollywood
glamour ask for it was really lovely and
it's beautiful material as well for faux
fur the two accessories are picked up
first of all this rose gold clutch
because I thought rose gold you can't go
wrong with this it'll go with so many
colors I'll go black dresses red dresses
white dresses and it's add a little bit
more glitz and glam so that's the season
it just opens up and then opens here and
you can get inside and also the bottom
also collapses down as well so you can
make it a bit wider at the bottom
my little pouch so I thought that was
really quite lovely
and I also picked up this metallic
clutch as well which again just sit open
can fit everything inside you can fit
loads inside of this then it's folds
over and you can fold it you can put it
underneath your arm and hold it I
thought it was really quite wearable I'm
ago so many glitzy festive dresses okay
moving on to the dresses so first thing
I picked up was this bodycon mini dress
I just really liked that it was black
but I had this little bit of a festive
glittery edging to it what was quite
sweet but because it's not too fussy
I'll fancy this it'll so many of you
would love this I think the rib
detailing down these two panels across
the body just help to keep it quite
cinched in my body console as well and
it's quite a lovely thick it elastane
fabric as well so it's got lots of
stretch so you'll feel really
comfortable
think in this so I really like that one
this one is so festive
it's beautiful color of this it's like
an ivory creamy silver I hope you can
see just how Goleta releases glitter
coming off it everywhere but it's
gorgeous and it ties at the back around
the back of your neck with some ties and
then it goes in down into a cowl neck
this is all completely open then how's
the excess cowl neck fabric so it's
really unique and really different and
some quite Grecian about this and just
goes down into a MIDI style as well I
thought that was beautiful the next
dress was a bit of a wild card but I saw
it and thought it just looks so
beautiful and this is a it looks more
red like bold red on camera but this is
much a bit more cherry red than that and
it's a hot neck completely open back
smack see sales it goes all the way down
to your shoes and I just thought the red
was so festive and beautiful and I don't
ever wear red so I thought take a chance
on this one and see how I get on the
next one I'm absolutely in love with and
it reminds me of a dress I got last year
from a sauce very very similar
loads of sequin work all over it this is
just as beautiful so it's got the mesh
to the cleavage area then goes down into
the beautiful pattern down the front
I just fastens at the back with a little
keyhole button fastening how gorgeous is
that
it's stunning this dress is so beautiful
this is River Island at a sauce and it's
a fully black dress but with this
amazing fringing with so much movement
to this so if you wanted to go out like
partying and dancing they'll be so much
you're so next gonna dance and something
like this but it's also got nice little
sleeves as well for Nelnet likes to have
their shoulders covered and then it
fastens around the back with another
little keyhole fastening she's really
sweet but again nothing too low copped
it's quite sophisticated it's still
quite covered and it's lovely length as
well that almost looks like it's to the
knee so yeah I really like this all the
texture our last dress is super simple
but I thought that
it would be great if you just stick some
accessories with it it will just make it
look a lot more glam and glitzy but for
any of you girls that don't really want
to do have a whole party thing that's a
bit too much glitter and glam then this
would be quite a good choice and it's
just a very simple black maxi let's go
into a full maxi with slits on either
side of the leg but it's just quite a
fitted style and I thought it'd be
really beautiful quite simple and
elegant and then you can just throw on
like the fur wrap or you can use a
little clutch bag that's a bit brighter
or maybe some shoes so I thought I'd
give this a go and also it's really
affordable as well and that is all the
pieces let's go try them on so this is
the river island at a sauce dress such
lovely textures it moves beautifully so
if you're going to talk to Christmas
dance Christmas party this is a really
lovely want to go for it's just got
keyhole fastening at the back a really
lovely length almost to the knees if it
feels really comfortable you won't be
put it down all night to put it with
these stilettos if I look quite classy
sophisticated and also the rose gold
clutch just for a little bit more color
and also you know a little bit more
color with your lip color as well I
really love this I think it's really
cute for a party dress I feel really
confident as well this dress is so
glittery it's gorgeous really lovely
ivory almost grey silver coloured dress
nice comfortable length I paired it with
these cute little pink pom pom champagne
pom pom shoes for a bit of glitzy
Clutton also the rose gold bag cowl
necks the back is so unusual I think
really Christmassy and festive and it
feels really lovely as well to work I
feel really quite confident
it feels really fitted if you're quite
feminine and
and I also look for like how to wear a
bra which is quite nice too because it's
a lovely fit nice high neck yeah
really like this dress is absolutely
amazing
I'm totally smitten with the color look
but got a whole neck lovely sexy low
back but these feel really fit since we
don't feel like they're gonna be showing
a side groove any time soon so it feels
really comfortable feel really pretty in
there but also really festive I'll put
it with the pink shoes I thought they're
quite fun and festive to you and also
the little bag the red lip I think sort
of deep red lip works beautifully with
them this dress is super simple but I
think if you had the right accessories
it makes it so much more glam and glitz
and festive so I'll put the Reese the
Risa a sauce scarf around my shoulders
to sit a little bit mocking Hollywood
glam and I've got the rose gold clutch
and also a pair that with these drop he
heeled boots just for a little bit more
height and also quite like the texture
with a bit of texture right bottom of
this sort of simple plain dress but I
feel so comfortable in this it fits
beautifully but it's just really simple
like I said with the right accessories
can make look so glam I absolutely
adores dress it's beautiful it's so nice
to have your arms covered as well offer
those jewels and embellishment it looks
so festive and fun and sparkly I'll put
it with the a sauce crease scarf because
think that the college works so well
together the silver gray the silver grey
in the dress so put those together
I've also paired it with the little
metallic clutch and also the black high
boots the dress itself fits so nicely
it's quite a nice length it
dress obviously but it's not too short a
dog feel comfortable in this but the
pattern work with beading it's so
flattering on the back some politely
hole fastening more embellishments and
really love this one this one is a very
very different this is more bodycon it's
again it's mini that's much more fitted
and it's more revealing so if you like
your store mini bodycon dress this might
be for you and back the whole neck style
but nothing too low it's feel to an item
fitted with this ribbed effect on the
side kind of sink juicy where nicely and
it feels really comfortable as well the
fabrics really nice and stretchy I
played with uh some talent clubs I
thought it went well with the colors I
also decided to go with a little black
velvet shoes a little bit more Sparkle
and ice absolutely everything guys which
was your favorite piece I'm still not
too sure I mean absolutely adore the red
I think the red is the most gorgeous
color and I like that I never usually
wear that and also the white glittery
dress they're all really really
beautiful so I can't decide yet I'm
going to have a little think about which
is my favorite and what kind of events
want to wear them all for but let me
know down below which was your favorite
piece and hopefully might inspire you
for your Christmas party this year too
