and I also have a few premium high
street items to show you as well but I

like a a sauce plus a few extra brands a
bit of a haul however first thing I do

kind of celebrate the hundreds lakhs
plus I'm nearly on 600,000 subscribers
so thank you so much guys my mind is
blowing this is amazing so to celebrate

Ferriss and together we're giving away a
Valentino rocks stood back it's worth
nearly 1000 pounds it's gorgeous it's

channels as well so make sure you're
following everywhere and you'll see what
is coming on Sunday I cannot wait anyway
let's get into this summer wedding
guests appropriate hot
in fact I kind of wore this because I
feel this is actually really appropriate
if you're going to like a garden party
wedding somewhere that's kind of you
know you'll be outside maybe it's
someone that's been inside for their
actual ceremony inand outside of the
reception you can have drinks
it's very lightweight it's really pretty
floral colors and you could wear some
gorgeous big hoops and earrings with it
some strappy heels sandals too / nice
you're gonna be on grass or not but yeah
I thought I'd wear this just to show you
it's like it's a lot of length it's
quite a long mini almost to the knees
it's got lots of pretty details so I'll
link this one down below as well but
okay I'm gonna start with this one so
I'm actually really excited about this
now this is a suit that found that I
thought would be really pretty little
cameos right in this floral print it
also comes in shorts by the way but I
got trousers it's quite nice thick
fabric let's try this okay a little
white cami of my own I'll link it down
below actually cuz I think I got this
myself whoa people like me you know this
is actually really really lovely quite
thick though my only worry is a little
thick so if you are in the sunshine and
your summer wedding you're gonna maybe
have to take off this blazer it's my
only concern
you know the fit of this is really nice
let me zoom you out here we go
fit it's really nice so kind of quite
fitted around the ankles some beautiful
nude shoes would fit perfectly with this
you know I actually really really like
it it's a jacquard is it no I don't
think you something it's just
embroidered embroidered
all over with these little and it's
almost like how you thin floral experts
will let me know I'm sure well how nice
is the fit is there I'm really really
like it guys I think it's a really cute
sign up Instagram stylee sure I'm a big
fan I'm a big fan I've lit with this
white but you could also pair it I've
also got this little black could this go
in a black what kind of like that the
contrast is quite nice otherwise blue or
a white to keep it nice and light for a
way
and I really really like her perfect
let's dive in again we've got a dress
very pretty it's creamy and it's got
lots of flowers all over it which I felt
was still appropriate for a wedding
because it's not fully white it's very
cute how beautiful is this dress
surely obsessed with they're almost a
little train here you see that guy's so
pretty but it's shorter at the front as
you can see it's a lot easy to walking
us have a bit of a lever train going on
here but the fit and the frills it's not
too over-the-top it's really pretty it's
not too overly sexy I mean I don't think
so let's see maybe you could do these a
little more so I mean you don't have to
have any cleavage if you don't want to a
little better please here just tell it
to you but this is so beautiful what do
you think I think this is beautiful by
the way everything I've got here is in
my usual size 6 just for anyone that's
wondering what sizes I've got let me
know I found a lovely mo thing again
florals because of course you can't
escape that this time if you hit and
again this is an extra small this is six
oh I think I'm gonna like this this is
really nice too wide leg nice wide leg
it's got a lot of shape to it a lot of
some lovely movement this mope Inc is
stunning it's like a blush mouth really
really like this fit the way it hangs
it's not too booby I mean I don't really
I don't really have big boobs anyway
what you don't mind hell I'm a little
bit spot I'm not showing too much I
could wear my push-up bra but it's not
gonna get for me too much cleavage so
don't feel too showy
but it's got nice if you do have goddess
big boots and this is still so beautiful
yeah I like it so much and others alike
for receptions and want it to like dance
a bit the dad dancing
apparently I mean this is pretty great
you know I'm really loved everything
I've found so far I don't know how I'm
gonna
here so please help you guys okay this
is the most expensive I think calmness
on its fall but for anything else you
want to spend a little bit more and get
something a little bit more embellish
it's a little bit more going on that you
might like this one it's pretty oh wow
the detail on this dress is absolutely
stunning
it's a pale blue grey cream embroidery
beautiful little petals and then set
lace embroidery and it's got tool it's
got sheer panels
it's got ruffles oh it's so cute it
really looks I think this looks more
expensive more special and we've got
some here as well it's got an
underlining in the grave just keeps you
all covered it's almost out well you can
see it's almost to my knees it fits
lovely it's so pretty it's really pretty
and feminine and a floaty I like this a
lot actually
what do you guys think of this one like
I said this is the most expensive on the
list I think this dress might be about
250 pounds it's more premium High Street
brand let me know what you think I think
this is so pretty
whoo the Seabreeze choice oh that color
this is like one of my favorite colors
not gonna lie guys I'm getting
absolutely boiling in this room place
lights on this is absolutely beautiful
this fit like it's like an actual dream
like they've fitted this to my body in
order to cut this this is so stunning
look at the color actually I'm in love
with this it's not something I would
usually go for but I mean the cut the
neckline is stunning I don't feel like
I'm falling out it just feels really
well put together everything is tight in
the right places so that you not feel
like you like Oh perfect length of
sleeves lace I'll gotta see it's like
broad around Blake's in different places
this pleating some it's not silk it's
like oh this goes to me and I love this
belting it there's something very
vintage and romantic
would you say this was guys up no.not
medieval nah I can't
I literally can't think of the word for
this do I really love this well the way
this it's not really high up here so I'm
not like its skimming my shoulders
absolutely beautiful I love this I
wonder if it I think it actually comes
in a few other colors as well if you do
like it but you're not showing this kind
of Seabreeze greeny blue it's not green
yeah but I actually think this is
beautiful this is stunning
oh yeah this one I promise absolutely
look this this is slightly white again
but it's mainly about the embellishments
Wow so I'm like poison ivy in this dress
I couldn't quite do it all up with
watching because alex is watching the
football in the other room I can't quite
get to so I thought I just shipped these
you can practically see how it fits this
is really cute really cute I do for that
poison I'm there with all the green
maybe it's a little bit too embellished
or maybe it's a bit too buttery sequiny
what do you think I stand a bit more
ladylike rather than this these fluted
sleeves well it's actually really pretty
it's beautiful material it's very well
made I love the green I'd often wear
green so this is quite nice to mix it in
with this white yeah I can love this how
it's like the high neck and here this is
really pretty I like it I'm just not
used to seeing myself in green I'm not
sure if it's a little too little too OTT
what do you guys think think about it
okay and then we've got another one this
is it a great I'm actually loving
everything so far I don't know how much
is here oh I remember this one this is
so pretty for the girls who like their
fitted bum down oh god I don't know who
I was kidding when I got this size you
know I think it's the right size me it's
just it's meant to be fitted give me a
minute a little bit hot trying to over
my head remember but no it's definitely
meant to be like step into it oh yeah
steeped throat eat but actually really
nice makes my figure look pretty bad
actually
I mean this is actually really nice this
is very different to everything else
this is a fitted body con for the girl
who loves her body wants to show it off
really but still wants something quite
floaty feminine a very pretty for
weddings the colors very pretty
does come in a lot of other colors I
just got this lavender gray blue was
really pretty this would suit a lot of
ladies I could see a lot of women
looking fantastic in this dress if I
remember rightly it's not six pound as
well so I don't think it was some too
crazy you just have to make sure that
you don't have a food belly well these
are the kind of things that would make
you look like you're a little bit
pregnant so ya can't see what you think
guys I think that's actually it I didn't
order two other things but they weren't
for this haul they were just for me yeah
I'll show you this one so I'm very
excited about this that I really want to
fit me I'm going to Italy tomorrow with
Armani so I'm filming on Monday this
just looks so Italian couldn't say no to
this little place it I mean this looks
like it could be very short well save a
house okay but quickly guys I'm going to
show you a couple of all the dresses
that I think you will like for wedding
season just really quick starting off
with this one that a few of you not seen
in my new vlog Karen Millen very very
kindly sent this to me and I think if
I'm not gonna wear any this new these
new pieces I picked up I'm gonna wear
this Saturday for this wedding if not
for the wedding after so I'll try it off
you can see Oh what does all of this
dress it fits so beautifully look at the
place the prints the mixture of this
baby pink with the fuchsia and the teal
blue some of my favorite combos and I
think it's absolutely stunning me look
at that links on this in fact my hair
like this although what I might do is
curl all of this as well so it's a bit
more curly but isn't that gorgeous also
got some Montana but I think a lot of
you guys would love this in fact I
showed my best mate that goddess and she
was like oh I wanted to buy this for the
same towards the same wedding so sorry
Rebecca yeah isn't it gorgeous I had to
show you guys then I also Vence thought
that this would be a great option as
well if you're someone who prefers
darker colors so I won't show you any of
the darker colors here so I thought
maybe something you guys would prefer
something a little deeper just have a
little pink top I wore this a few days
ago actually have tripped I was on with
me as I Michelle and I got so many
compliments on it oh it's so pretty and
it's really comfortable
how's this masticated ruffled waist here
which means it a little bit more cinched
without feeling like too constrained
around the stomach which I hate when you
try to eat it has this ruffles and I
really like this print it's really
unusual it almost looks a bit like eggs
like fried eggs I don't think it is it's
more like flowers Tomatoes like fried
egg yes like this an open flip and it's
a great length there's a hankerchief
style silhouette but I thought a lot of
you guys would love absolute love this
dress and in fact I think this dress is
30% off right now so everything will be
linked and I also thought I'd really
quickly mention this dress now I really
hope this is still in I am as you may
know this was in an ASIS hall a few
months ago and took it to India with me
but I've had it in my closet waiting for
a wedding coming this is perfect
especially for a reception because the
lights aren't disco lights when you're
all dancing all reflect on this so try
this on finally I remember a lot of you
guys a lot of this dress and it's sold
out I think really quickly about hoping
they've got a few more back hand for you
because I think it is absolutely perfect
for weddings the tulle and the way it
just looks so Cinderella like and then
it's cut it's like sorry I'm not doing
