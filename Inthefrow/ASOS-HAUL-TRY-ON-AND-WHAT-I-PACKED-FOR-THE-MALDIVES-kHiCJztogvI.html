sauce hole this is going to be a bit of
an asshole slash holiday why I packed
Hall as you can see I'm in a very very
different surrounding I'm currently in
the Maldives I know a lot you probably
saw that on snapchat Instagram and
everywhere else but I really wanted to
film the halt from here
and sort of show you almost around the
islands a little bit as I try on all of
this bearing so first I'm going to show
you what I got from a faff to kick this
ah I got this really sweet pair of
sandals of one is quite a few times they
are really comfortable but lovely sweet
lacy pattern with these little
butterflies on there it has rose gold
straps and they still straps go up your
legs but it was really really
comfortable what size I get easy I've
got these in a size sort of a half size
bigger than they'd just be really fit
nothing comfy but yeah but they were
really gorgeous those are the bats if
you want doing what that noises so this
is one of my favorite things I brought
actually if I see a sucker print like a
striped peach and cream print all the
way throughout fabric and it's just one
of those very low necks and it goes all
the way around to the back sauce it's
low it back low at the front I've tried
quite a lot of these from suits and in
the past they've always kind of might
show my boobs that booms have popped out
and then or something but these are
actually really quite comfortable I
don't feel that unsecure in this it's
really gorgeous really flattering
swimsuit I love the color another
favorite actually this is so beautiful
it's got a bit for caftan meets the
wrong meets long floaty dress feel it's
a bit of a thing it's kind of thing I
throw on over a bikini in the same way I
would have CAFTA
it's just really stunning I've been
wearing this or like a gorgeous blue
Melissa oh gosh bikini that's going to
show you next and it just really sets
off the colors and it just fits
perfectly over that area so you can just
see a little bit of your bikini poking
out but with these cap sleeves and long
length and the way it's cut into three
sections - it kind of flows and the wind
it's really really flattering it's a
really great piece if you're going away
soon I would highly recommend this
I love wearing it so much next I've got
to jersey pieces like a black jersey but
it's not very easy for you to throw on
whether it's sort of casual or evening
pair of heels first one being this
halter neck it ties around the back as
well and it's closer you can throw on
over the key Nate and just feel it
secure in it it's a nice length I wallet
on a boat trip of the day this felt
really pretty in it like easy piece and
then this one actually is my favorite
I've been wearing this so much and again
it's black chairs material this feels a
little bit thicker than the last one
actually but it's got these gorgeous
pom-poms runs down the arm holes
this gives with more texture it's quite
fun and cute again into these shorts are
too tight so it just really free really
kind of easy to wear it also looks quite
flattering when you wear it and can-can
you can wear it with heels they could
wear it with flats and de-stress exam
but a more evening peak so I think all
the perfect for your autumn madro not
just flat holidays or like holidays is
this gorgeous play through again this is
just like a sauce own but it a almost a
turquoise teal fabric underneath this
black leg so just sort of shows through
it's very deep green with the two
different tones
it's got mesh it's got higher net comes
around the back with a zip and then
fastens at the back of the next got a
bit of a keyhole and it's long sleek I
just felt really pretty wearing this
I've saw it was really flattering it's a
good length for play suit I've quite
covering as well for like cool tonight
over here it's been great but this is
kind of thing I will wear back in London
over autumn and into winter really this
is kind of like a going out piece next I
got this towel because I thought just in
case you weren't in towels here and I
wanted a bit cuter to sit on the beach
in I got this towel black and white
Aztec print it has fringe ring around
the edges it's just one of those cool
round towels that were kind of quite
hype last year I remember but I really
really wanted one for this trip I
thought was lovely I also got this
bikini which is just under here let me
show you I've been wearing it's loads
it's a gorgeous kind of peachy tone it's
but a ribbed patterning it's really
quite flattering on my little boobs as
well so I quite like it and it goes down
to normal little string bikini buttons
but I thought this was gorgeous and they
also do this and lots different types of
styles it's almost a mix and match style
they're doing at the moment so you can
get it in bikini style balcony polt neck
and a few different types of bottoms as
well I thought sure you got and last but
not least I got an inflatable pineapple
yeah so I really wanted something fun to
bring for like pictures not to be really
cute and I've seen so many people with
these inflatable things so I want the
pineapple we blew up ourselves you're
going out split up feels like some time
to do this it's so big we've been really
nice to have quite fun what kinds of the
pool and in the sea okay so a few more
things I brought with me these red heels
I don't really bring any other heels
apart from these and these are from next
next this season are really killing it
when it comes to accessories long after
this before but they're accessories this
season especially heels are so gorgeous
and these are beautiful or a cherry red
they've got a great set of straps look
at the leg so this really flattering a
nice strap over your foot there's a
really gorgeous pair of shoes so I Pat
those for the trip I've been looking for
this pair of sandals for so long they've
been sold out everywhere I finally found
it before I came away I thought seeing
as I've been wanting so much I'll treat
myself to get pair and these are by Lena
Lena darky a Greek design I think
they've been so hyped this whole summer
with this whole pom-pom lacey sequin
beadwork now there's so much going on
with these shoes but I really really
love them and I really wanted them I
mean they're all kind of tangled who hit
me the whole this color and everything
but they're just gorgeous so I've got a
pair those as well
I brought a swimsuit with me this one
from Elle space how gorgeous is call it
the white orange possibly orange and
also mint green so it was beautiful the
colors so much and it was just beautiful
style how it cross-sells at the back and
whole back connects both just really
gorgeous style and I'll mixing this up
with I'm just kind of picking everything
up here I also brought my self-portrait
dress as my kind of evening piece and
factor brought to I thought I show you
the slides gorgeous lace work and nude
backing so just looks
really just looks like you're wearing a
full lace body really beautiful and I
also really pretty when I wear this I've
got another bikini from cease folly
running current all over this tropical
bloom white deep black print all over it
and the same to the halter neck top
adoption where these helps knit tops
I've really enjoyed grown s and it also
double-sided picking also where it's dry
key which is kind of cool because then
you get to bikinis for one price again
another piece from else based I really
wanted just for more beach dresses to
wear because in the Maldives especially
you generally just wear these dresses
and bikinis miss today's clips are so
hot so I got this one from Elle space
it's a stunning print just white blue
look know how to scribe a print but it's
just a lot going on it's quite busy it's
shorter at the front with the drape and
they goes longer these two box would be
might squabbling for days and we keep
seeing them kind of puppetry we get so
really little that dress I brought one
key accessory with me which was the
Gucci velvet mama bag hey shut up shut
up shut up
I brought one key accessory with me the
Gucci mama bag in the velvet green sorry
about the bat so just this thing going
off so long I want to carry on with
video and it just goes is pretty much
all the dresses I brought picked option
and another piece actually at this
Melissa Oda bash placing again it's just
really light really kind of billowy it's
not tight so it doesn't kind of feel too
much when it's so hot but it's a great
little cover-up of
Keeney's and it just goes down into
little pair of placing shorts switch
eyes around the waist to put in and then
ties around to here as well so it's kind
of the larger side pull in and make it
how you like but yeah I love it another
became to show you is this one from
Melissa oh - I were a lot of Melissa
other brushes pieces as I've mentioned a
few here but I just find they're just
really feminine and flattering and quite
sexy as well and this one is in a blue
reptile print with these gold pieces to
each side halter neck and then the
bottoms again these gold pieces here and
a full blue that's a print
I was felt really pretty wariness it
really tells me in it all right places
