of Hall I think this might be a really
good one as I remember from what I
ordered
a lot of really cool things in here I'm
going away on Tuesday and I actually
needed some new things in my wardrobe if
you can actually believe it I felt like
I have a few gaps in there things that I
needed more for spring and kind of more
pieces just to enhance everything else I
have just to mix and match with
everything else so in here are some
really really cool pieces I'm really
excited about them let's try them all
together and see what we think he's
learning your swag as always
okay remember is another thing to hang
out I'm really excited about this okay
so things that I pulled out this bag is
a cute little chair so they happened I
actually bought this yesterday what you
think is part of the Maria gratia Curie
range from Dior and it's kind of like
the statement star I love it I saw it
and I was like I need to get it before
it sells out again so I got this
yesterday so I might not actually need
this now because I want you to cool do
all this cool little choker when it is
very cute though
this is hearts in like a felt all around
that is very very cute actually
but do I need it now and our deformed
y'all don't know very nice so I like
yeah God so much in here okay this top
is so cute look at this so it is an
off-the-shoulder Bardot style bit quite
thick like a really thick embroidered
fabric and it could look amazing just
with some cute don't sure I like it I
wanted a bit of a lighter colored pair
of jeans because I realized I really
have any light-colored but not too light
colored shoes so I got a pair from a
sauce obviously I mean quite like these
and they have just some minimal cuts to
the knees and oh yet close longer at the
front on the bottom of the leg and then
shorter at the back kind of like cut
like this it looks very cool on the
model so let's see them pull those up
totally in love with the top how cuter
it's a I love it if you like need
to be like
gymnix kill her and that dance on the
beach and life ever since an absolute
yes the jeans I like it will completely
love them though I saw I like the
alcohols a lot more but actually realize
I do like turn ox machines and Cantley
turn up the jeans when they're a little
bit asymmetrical start but I do like the
rock fit in the feel and it's a great
color
I just built in the quite what I wanted
the children actually really cube it's a
perfect kind of size so isn't such a
value what your tie and actually really
cute thickness would look volumes of so
many talked about it like I said I do
just have the brand new walk so I really
need it for the price this is such a
good one by the way of course everything
will be listed down below in order that
I show you just in case you like and
bang six up pair of shoes Cielo is
everywhere and I saw these and I thought
the big great cut around the pool and
all that kind of jazz there's really
old-school little sliders quite like him
I mean surprise I'm think these were
like 20 quid something that really is
quite affordable and quite like them so
give those a try
these are so cool thing I think I'm
definitely gonna keep these just because
it's so like usable of wearable and
perfect for our trip we're going arms so
just like around the pool there and
children running flat you know it's
super super easy and really affordable
so I'm happy it's got cute little top in
here that is sweet it's really sweet
this is from Miss Selfridge and it's
like cheesecloth great top with some
beautiful bro during wave cooked out
details I'm here this is very cute and
very me very me at the back it ties a
little tighter like it let's try that on
totally all now got a new bra row
underneath and but I feel it can work
I like it's got this the back I think
it's a very pristine that boho with a
pair shorts especially high-waisted it's
going to look really cute especially
with a blazer over it yeah well this is
a definite keeper
ooh Ginga are taking them it's
everywhere and I cut it up Oh anything
Kingdom so I thought I'd go and try the
trendy
hell oh yeah not cute it's a very tiny
very sweet Bardot top with very sweet
ruffle sleeves ruffling along here as
well that it's very very cute and I
found having a good body day this will
look fine wines it's very cropped so see
how it looks it's a scent here and love
it fits amazing it's got a zip here so
it kind of fits really perfectly around
makes it look too baggy so it's got a
lovely shape to it it's very good tweet
and a little bit Little House on the
Prairie Padma it's a rule it is so cute
absolutely I'd like this actually with
her jeans and heels or boots or
something I think's really nice for
holidays it's very interesting but if
you like am interests then thank you
like it next we have a Bardot top this
is an a soft own Bardot in white with
this cute ruffles around the very top
and more saluted sleeves well this needs
a really good iron and it feels like a
cotton fabrics that feel like the best
fabric ever I'll be honest here I mean
it could look kind of cute underneath
this place Rachman see that looks like I
think for a basic cotton bar there that
makes is a fluted burn sleeves this is a
really great option I think it's quite
an expensive it just kind of takes off a
few different trend boxes and it's not
sure if I prefer this one on the other
white Bardot I've got in the hole so let
me know what you think it was very
comfortable fits really nicely yeah one
kit Oh what it is okay oh this is very
very very cute remember this now again
very kind of cheesecloth crepe fabric
very sweet little please
it's a little bit of a body shape in
style with buttons at the front at a
very it cut craft is also ruffled
there's a lot of different textures
going on here
after the stripes I thought of holiday
it could look really adorable with some
sure so we'll see that on another very
very very cute - what I think I matched
I have to keep all these up this is very
cute single eyes but this one is a
little bit longer so it's not quite
crapped it's perfect with these students
it just causes
it's not too long I love little straps
I'll offer roughly bit it is very cute
and it does pull human here really
nicely it fits like a dream this is nice
this is very pretty very pretty actually
this analysis has fought again I kind of
hope you can seek I know it's so right
here so many people always say is so
bright in this room so much whiteness
going on it you can't see anything
so I'm very sorry but I hope so you can
just about see it beautiful cooked at
work down the very front with some
ruffles so Margaret ant shape but a
longer lengths it's not cropped this
could look very very beautiful on Ashley
especially with shorts not very nice
another really lovely lacy top here just
saw a I remember one give again too many
I'm going to have too many more donut
this is also really sweet a very
different style longer I've tucked it in
but this is it looks like out and wear
it out as well
yeah it just fits really nicely it's
very sweet I love the ruffles and lace
work yeah I think it's a very cute top I
guess it's bit more than the shorts and
the other ones it's bit more reserved I
really like it
oh yeah pretty blouse and it feels on
 so this is a polyester fabric
which isn't the best but sometimes you
get that for price don't you it's got
this mesh lace at the very top some
ruffles again I've got the memo about
the ruffles I think here I think
sometimes I get something in my head and
I'd get everything that I think is like
that trend and signed out which is the
best so what I've sort of done here this
is Margaret Brown top style very sweet
with this one put it on a bottle yeah
well not not asking on but now after
looking at it in the mirror few times
and I actually it's really really nice
too many nice tops in this hole and I'll
say I feel like I've done pretty lucky
this is really cute as well and although
it is polyester it does feel quite nice
it's not feeling really low quality
doesn't feel too cheap or anything like
actually really liked it it's very very
pretty
what do you think things it was a very
simple t-shirt dress yeah is just a gray
t-shirt dress like very minimal
very very basic but I just had in my
head this could be kind of cute with a
blazer thrown over it and some knee-high
boot or just some like cool but very
cool ankle boots I just got some amazing
arms from betting on which could look
amazing with this so we'll see this is
super basic and chilled but I think it's
kind of one of those pieces you can keep
in your wardrobe for it like whenever
you need it
so with denim jacket through and over it
a leather jacket I just put on with cute
little pair of boots that we have over
knee boots you have really heeled boots
you know heel you know it was kind of
easy to trot belt on with it I didn't
quite like it for the price of it just
going to have it around you just want a
very shield a letterman jacket going out
I like it largely what you guys think oh
yeah these are saw really like just if I
could update two things I've already had
in my wardrobe before but a bit more
wearable so they're just a very cute
sandal with a little pom-poms on it and
this is called nice round your leg but
they were really free I think this might
be one of the best hope of ever doing I
literally love everything these are
amazing we're not too fiddly they're
really comfortable and really bright
they're not going to rub my feet because
they're just over the toes rather in the
toes on the feel of these two bit so big
okay okay next up another top oh and
it's another bar down to hot blonde
behold but aunt is actually related to
my website though it look really cute
and I like the way it got Cerreta
running through the sleeves to pull it
together so it's a bit more sort of
ruffled and textures very cute I like
that this is actually really nice it
fits nice it feels really secure a light
for details and swings it gives a bit
more texture and a bit more kind of
silhouette fit so yeah you actually
really really liked it and the last
thing is bag is another pair of light
blue jeans high-waisted some cool
contrasting colors in there with the
dark blues and very cool frayed core
uncle yes the jeans are like they fit
great English jeans always interesting
really nice
just depends what we've got on them
whether I really like them or not and
it's not too sure all three uncool I'm
not too sure on the style and also
really into the whole crafting trend so
maybe try and look against markup use
but I do like them there's a little fit
it was not quite what after and that is
it guys what do you think up-to-date are
