forever the 1st of 2017 where the hell
have I been I'm excited to get into this
so I went shopping on a truck
I have a few things I kind of needed and
off to LA and Fashion Week a lot of LA
as a New York Fashion Week is in London
Milan and Paris so needs a few bits can
I chop up my wardrobe so the few things
here that kind of really really needed
30 bags this is kind of fun box and bag
together you know logistical it in
pencil if you haven't been here before I
will leave a little subscribe button on
the screen now make sure you can stick
around please subscribe for two videos a
week I'd love to help me come back okay
this is it bag number one what's it to
remember me oh yeah you get aget okay as
you may know I'm big into the whole kind
of mini dress either jumper dress or
shirt dress thing with OHS new boots
right now still massively in fat so I
saw this actually this is from Sport max
it was like a cotton mention stylist
very life lace work in these two panels
galas run it's a lovely light blue it
goes down into a longer length I was
like a long yes can I go okay so I
try to do some types of do's and do
quite like it with these flash and boot
arises although I feel this is a little
bit too long I do like to have that kind
of slight bit of leg in it too but with
the black boots I thought I put it on
with a black belt because in our state
it's kind of a little bit shapeless
without a belt
salicylate without the belt I'm not sure
I'm gonna keep it but let me know what
you think to how I found it the belt so
they did you give me another damn power
oh my god okay and it's identical to
what I'm wearing
so this is a gorgeous knit though this
is a beautiful Thrym knitted pilot
jumper my crochet please really cool so
it's what ripped on the body and then a
lacy lacing crochet effect to each
sleeve and a lovely turtleneck so it's
kind of me all over and I love this
color this is much more kind of
oversized in my little junk post
but I kind of like it the back just a
little bit different it's great detail
especially
so you two small conscription a to do is
like that in the net so you just come
back something a little bit different to
the whole thing yeah it's a little bit
larger look at my cozy and comfy just
depends do I really need another jumper
I don't know about do really like you
blacks can come here
oh yes purging they are an uncle length
kind of uncle braids alone I'm still
obsessed with that from the stress work
through each new first sample by thought
if they fit nicely and I'll have the
great style to them and again it will
look amazing a pet ankle boots the jeans
fit great I've gotten to my usual size
yeah looks get really really nice lovely
skinny love the midrash blue beautiful
is really easy colors to wear if it's
really nicely on the floor just like an
all-around easy pair jeans with just a
bit of stressing a good uncle length and
to Flint
to my amazing like restore the boots and
offsets will be really cool outfit
specially with the gray jumper as well
together just as a simple layering piece
I picked up another body
it's a white turtleneck body with no
sleeves or sleeveless but general get
them with sleeves but I figured if I'm
going to serve the top or shirt or
jumpers then it wouldn't be a massive
deal I often find I have a few of these
in a drawer I have like a drawer full of
different bodies and they always come in
handy and it's good to have a nice white
one we'll see how that looks on I think
for how affordable it is it just one of
easy things with like you can I draw
sedate I really need it it will fit
really nicely I've not got my smooth bra
wrong cuz I can't find it I'm sorry I
knew Brian I think it's fine and put it
with my little mascara and it's quite
work
see it's one of the things you can pair
with everything it's worth having in
case you need it one day guys look what
I found
I know it's not the right season from it
but I've been looking for this for
months if you know my eight or toes
while you'll know I've been looking for
this for month I think I found what I
like yay it's a rest men suit where it's
actually Marvin neons pinky red it's not
completely red so sweet
well this is a Body Glove swimsuit in a
great low back you love a particular
back
I hope it looks is amazing of the help
it will do I look like Pamela Anderson
yet really really like it looks great
color this is a Ralph Lauren gray ribbed
little neck top pretty much just really
easy simple I'm sort of turtleneck 1/2
said is actually beautiful fabric
absolutely beautiful soft fabric this is
another great fit
I love a Fitbit feels really flattering
the eautiful fabric which have secant
painful not beautiful fabric with it
being wrapped Lauren and so that is
really really lovely it fits really nice
yeah and I think it looks really great
the pair jeans we feel right this is
kind of my style
all those are some really easy lovely
materials start with an easy pair jeans
look into I mean like here okay I bought
this on a whim because I saw her on the
site and totally fell in love with it
but I was feeling it look awful on my
skin tone I think for darker skin turns
to look incredible
this one too it's sort of a golden
office tinted green are more of that
kind of styled gold but when the light
catches it might be a little bit more
kind of golden but lovely little back
host looks amazing I think I'm a skin
tone it might be right I can't have an
incredible counter edit
I love happy metallic it off so see I
love Justin soon it looks so much better
than I thought it was
although understood as a pioneer that
the crotch area has too much fabric so
that in any way that you wear it it just
doesn't look flattering so I can't
really wear it and I'm really good
because I'm really like I think it looks
great
what are just too much fabric in the
cotton this dress is so pretty I totally
fell for this when I saw it it's very
pretty very kind of cinnamon meat
self-portrait in a way I so looks like
this
very cute pink I mean it might be a bit
too cutesy it's very kind of frilly
ruffle legs yeah kind of everything all
over this dress so I'll have to try it
on a nutshell if colors mind I'm not
sure a moment with conscious Barbie doll
c39 brother
parts of it I really like I think it
does have something very very cooling to
keep seeing quite self-portrait around
here in some way and then there's lots
of details like that has really tough
now and really beautiful but then the
backs lovely lovely open back but
overall I think it's really pretty and
it's not sure overall if it's just a bit
to come Victoriana style a bit too and
that your fashions may I don't know what
okay next up is a job state currently no
address really long lovely dress in
black and feel like this detailing to
each size this lace work low v-neck
backing and quite a low B next to the
front but I thought could potential it's
really really gorgeous and we're going
away to LA I thought I needed like a
lovely dress just in case I need an
extra dress I really like this one so
excited to see that on actually I love
this so much aren't I so much mom I
thought I would and it looks good in the
one side but and it's cute it's got a
really like it feel really comfortable
to wear another branches again it of
skills looks like I'm gonna fall out
feel comfortable I really like the sound
detailing without something a little bit
different to it which is really
appreciate that is great slips down each
leg again makes it a little bit sexier
but it's not chief active it's not too
overly sexy it's a really lovely black
dress I think this is a big hit I like
it okay
couple more pieces this jumper can
remind me a little bit of Gucci guides
becomes floral embroidery
it's very loosely related right now I
saw it and it just kind of reminded me
so it'd be quite a nice little piece and
believe it or not think this is actually
yes with the new look pretty nice fabric
it's also not the best fabric in the
world but it's also much more affordable
but it's a six great fit and bride
Jessica Reuter is going to use his
season and a really nice easy links not
too corrupt and also not too long after
you really really like Linux unlike the
large embroidery I think it looks really
quite cool and a little bit different
everything that Elsa got I've got great
for cuticle to wear as well
like it with the jeans and you think
it's quite a nice even for using to
throw on you could dress it up and dress
it down putting how you wearing it
okay another pair jeans is prone
Monteith on the river island you can
realize I thought there actually sucks
and I got this I do really like the
marching through around so that was make
sense it's a really great light wash
color lots of distressing down these
more of a not wider leg well a more
relaxed fit leg more boyfriends diet
well mom style and yes great highly fit
so the jeans I actually really really
like so much my eyes even saw I would to
be honest even when I put the mask on
not too sure actually I pressed and a
lot I put this curved felt on in there
and I put on my little Chandi to rocky
core so it's mitt more my style and
really really liked them I think they
fit really nicely but not overly draggy
or to mom Jean a scandal about style and
it's not enough fitted on the bone but I
don't think it's it's not too bad I
think it supports larger range right in
the very ground that piece in here on my
list of things that kind of felt I need
is my wardrobe
oh yes again another high net cop it's
very nice fabric out there oh really
flat cotton so it's a really smooth
cotton finish just a nice layering piece
perfect I mean where's things like this
like light wash it black and I feel that
you can't be that combo my favorite kept
saying I shall have to live in gorgeous
tops and jeans forever was incredible
pair heels that's kind of my sorority
okay so really really like this I know I
have so many of the youth litter so many
I know it's not necessarily body but
just to tuck into paramon jeans or
high-waisted jeans works just as easily
to be honest it's been comfortable so
trying something systems my most basic
so I can need in my water okay so that
was everything guys what was your
