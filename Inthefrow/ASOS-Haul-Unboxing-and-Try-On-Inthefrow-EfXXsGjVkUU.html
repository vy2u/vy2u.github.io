video I just got a big parcel from a
sauce and I figured I'd open it with you
and we'd go to the close together and
would try them on together and we'd see
what you want to keep by the way I am
wearing a jacket indoors it's because
I'm a little bit cold and I don't want
to have to put the heating on so let's
just go for it then straight off okay so
with this I went a little bit spendy
yesterday I bought one thing on its own
and then a lot of things to get there
remember at my blog you might know
there's like an area called shop and in
there I make wish list of all the things
that I'm absolutely in love with and
have to have and well I made one of
those of the day and then realize I had
to have most of the things on that list
so I've ordered everything with the
intention of sending a lot of it back so
this is going to be for the purpose of
finding out what we look the most I'm
gonna use my trusty scissors get into
this bad boy and we're in first thing I
got was this t-shirt from a bow it's a
jersey sweater material that says Maison
suitemates also home sweet home
obviously it's actually a beautiful
fabric really cute I thought that'd be
really sweet for summer the spring and
swearing with pet jeans or through an
over something so I like that okay next
thing what it what's it this is a
t-shirt with a high neck by the way
everything I bought here I'll leave down
below with links so you can go straight
to them don't you worry so I bought this
because I had gotten massive thing at
the moment of wearing white t-shirts
because white t-shirts go with
everything so I got this one the high
necks again I'm also obsessed with my
met turtlenecks as you might know and
she really lovely fabric so again just a
basic white vest polyester fabric
I kind of got this overhang at the back
the overhangs and drapes and then it has
a d-ring to close at the back just kind
of slow everything in I just thought
that was quite cute violation wondering
this coat it's in a stone color answers
from pretty little things if sleeveless
deep v-necks flowers it reminded me of a
Victoria Beckham laptop that I've seen
that have this bit the ruching effect
down the V thought this was quite nice
to wear with trousers and nude pumps
nude court shoes beautiful fabric again
like really lovely kind of luxurious
fabric now this top 475 pounds but I
thought I'll order it just to see what
it's like and if it's worth 75 pounds
and I'm not sure it kind of to me looks
a little bit like chef white don't know
how I'm feeling about it and it's also
very oversized incredible fabric though
that fabric is tops of silk but quite
thick textured silk so fabric stunning
absolute beautiful I'm just not sure why
it looks a bit like chef white okay so
so far we've had five white tops let's
get into some colors shall we
some a little count moment from Couture
pair of jeans so I start trying socks I
haven't tried at a soft jeans for a long
time actually quite cute skinny jeans
with some rips to the legs the knees and
yeah you know regular jeans put the
quite sweet so quite that dance the
color is lovely quite nice spring Jean
next up slim mom jeans say now I do like
mom jeans a lot on these but really nice
really high waisted cool color I really
vintage wash color these rips
distressing just a very nice pair of
denim actually next up these are pair of
cheap Monday jeans like these are kind
of mangy in their deck for too big favor
our mom Jean was just really straight
straight all the way down and the model
happen on with pair court shoes I loved
this we next up is a pair of white
written uncovering quite sweet
obviously the test I think with white
jeans is whether or not you can see your
naked through them so I'll be doing the
nickers test and the last pair of jeans
I really like these are like a dark gray
black charcoal we've got some
distressing to each knee and yeah pretty
nice high waisted style again moving on
to shoes got a few pairs of shoes first
up being some Pumas I've been up just
some white trainers for a while so let's
see what these will look quite like them
so these are Pumas Puma baskets yeah
just a cute little sneaker really I mean
I'm not really trained aware uh but I'm
thinking about wearing it with mom jeans
for spring and just kind of casual it
went up my outfit what sorts of looking
she can trainers be chic I don't know
next up are from June and if I'm going
on holiday next month
some things I could wear like a slider
and I saw these in June I thought these
were really cute aren't they sweet we've
got that Birkenstock style Solway fetus
it's in sad shape because it's just deep
pink leather bands over the top
these are 49 pounds I think should have
been going through all the prices here
but I forgot to but they'll be down
below next up are a pair of
that were in sale actually reduce to
about 17 pounds so these just look
really quite cute just throw on with
pair jeans and then 17 pounds
they're nice as soon as I saw its jumper
I was in love with it so I'm really
trying it lifted my expectations however
again this is one pricey jumper this was
75 pounds for this jumper like I said I
was like I really like this is from a
brand called just female and it is this
pink toweling style material knit pink
jumper and it is really really cute by
the way I am getting my hair done by it
in fact by the time you see this video
I've got my hair done to thank the Lord
it's so like so many people like where's
your purple hair god it's like well I'm
sorry but it fades I think I could do a
pretty please all that I'm gonna no I'll
try everything on show you and then yeah
make up my mind
okay guys so first outfit I'm wearing
with a white silky chef's whites out top
with the cheek under jeans I thought
would be too big slate they are too big
but only by a size of slow so I'm going
to reorder need to think that like the
very cropped straight leg know
distressing static they're really quite
cute I'm spoiling with my John Titor
Rossi corpse cuz I'm all about wearing
some jeans of course no man I love that
the top is gorgeous but I don't think
it's worth 25 pounds so I'm putting an
SMS back okay first impressions I love
it actually love that s you can see
online but this is some new doll-like
because these won't be too bad at all I
don't think that's too bad
but fit it's actually really good I
think everyone's gone one time with
these I think I'll do these are 26
something actually five but this jumper
I think is gorgeous and I love combo
colors and I'm also wearing my course
game but as a little outfit I think this
is so cute
a little bit so these are yeah okay so
an X outfit I've gone with the Maison
sweet Maison these on scotch tee with
the stressed balloon skinnies which are
the perfect size this time I will not
surrender with the little black flats
which I'm not peeing off but not overly
comfortable over the top your feet and
they make my feet look really wide -
don't like both the jeans are a great
fit really nice clothes dressing and the
tea is also pretty cool I think I
probably got a lot of wear out of this I
think it's yes to take maybe to the
jeans and notice shoes okay so next I'm
back on for the white steering vest with
the grey skinnies I know they don't
really go but it's the sake of travel to
get there to show you I've also got a
little sliders so finders are super
comfortable that really comfortable
I'll fit really well my size for feet
these are size false it seemed to fit
pretty true to size the white top nice
it's already creased which means you'd
have to look I know every time you used
it and it's quite see-through so you can
see my bra through it so I'm not too
sure that's the great skinnies are nice
perhaps a little bit too long I'm
usually a thirty two leg I think maybe
should on fourth it looks quite longest
about to turn them up and I feel like
the foot through a little bit too low so
I might give these ms2 but sliders are
in yes I think okay so the final outfit
aren't the mom jeans in high waisted the
Puma trainers and this white top now the
white top makes me feel like a dentist
it's too high neck so this is a no the
genius actually quite liked at first
because they're really soft fitted for
mom Jean but they're too long I feel
like mom jeans need to be cropped so
I've had to pull out myself but by doing
that and look like I've got a really
short legs so I'm not keen on those the
pima's are cute and I think I probably
will keep these because these are kind
of what I've been after but the top and
the jeans I think are a no and the very
last thing is this looking pop chiffon
top I actually quite like this I think
you've got a lot of things it's quite
sophisticated it's quite mature style
like I said it's very can Victoria back
at the moment as well it could work top
10 or not now that I paired the jeans
with Ted of course she's actually fat
prefer them now I think they look a bit
sexier and sleeker and my legs don't
look quite short because they don't have
the sneakers on anymore and like I said
it could tuck this
so I do quite like this now as an outfit
so I might be thinking these jeans and
that was the whole unboxing hopefully
that gave you a few ideas of new things
that you might not have spotted on any
size I spotted and now you can go buy
them and love them as well hopefully
enjoyed this kind of setup trying on
things and boxing the whole the whole
thing so let me know if you did and I'll
do a lot more of these but as always if
you like the video then please do give
it a like and subscribe if you are new
and in that case I'll see you in my next
box bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
