new a sauce unboxing video I serve scene
from the title I filmed one of these now
about seven eight months ago it's one of
my most watched videos that you guys
loved it loved the concept in the whole
way put it together so a minute to do
more for ages just like it so this is
going to be it I went on to a sort of
the day
found load loads of new bits they've got
in I thought I'd order all of them so
that we can kind of try them on together
see which ones we liked the most and
then I can send the ones back that I'm
not interested in so we will go through
all the clothes and at the end I will
try on everything so a lot of people
last time light you not try it on the
clothes because they didn't watch it to
the end so watch the end and then you'll
see everything that we try on you can
let me know which you like the most
everything that I own back I will leave
a link down below so you can go and find
it super easily if you'd like to so
let's just get into it
okay so bag number one I've have these
that waiting to film this video now for
a few days I've been desperate to kind
of see what I ordered so it's like a
third item with a Bardot white top this
is actually a size four because if you
run out vary the size hopefully restock
it but I might put this up I thought
I'll just go to size four see what
happens but I have salute love this
embroidery all over the front and little
buttons down the middle is something
very sort of Swiss about this I thought
it was super cute I mean thing is I feel
like I should have bought it once ago
because it's not quite summery but we'll
see let's see what it looks like on the
next item I ordered was this suede
jacket this is lovely but sure this is
never
yeah it's that was a little more money
but got that in UK six this is a black
it from s3 I really liked the cuffed
sleeves on this I thought it was
extremely wearable to fill many
occasions I absolutely do off shirts as
you know it's actually really lovely
fabric to be quite thick cotton fabric
next up is a pair of cotton trousers I
saw these teeny bit of an iron but these
are in the rust color and I thought they
looked really cute and easy to throw on
I really love the way that they dress
them up on the website looking at them
now I'm not too sure if these are very
me or not do have one little pocket on
the bum and two pockets as well out
sides it's not to see those arms but ya
do quite like them I feel like they
might better on than off no look a
little bit like Genie pants this is just
an a sauce own easy white crop fix is
only half a cup of pounds I thought it
would go with those rust trousers I
think next is this cute little Bardot
strap your tops toast
strappy over your shoulders and then it
sort of comes around the edge of your
arms really lovely fabric really easy
simple fabric yeah thought it was quite
pretty and really feminine this is a
dress from whistles and if you watch my
child for a while might know I was
absolutely obsessed with a black
whistles dress a while ago I wore it
non-stop but not off so solid so today
this so is a navy and black knitted
dress so it's knitted I didn't realize
lovely
knitted dress going start this to a
rounded dropped hem at the bottom that's
rather a love lipstick looks like on
this was something I order but I wasn't
overly sure on but I thought I look
really great or really not right and it
a pair of it's like a jumpsuit clopped
jumpsuit to River Island with a zip down
back up into a high collar sleeveless
into collapse so a pair of stilettos it
could look really kind of killer
sophisticated so we'll see the last item
in this bag is this super pretty top
that is adorable
I'm really loving these very feminine
most boho inspired lacy tops right now
especially once at high neck and
sleeveless I saw this and thought it was
super adorable embroidery down there and
then lace down Center a nice round color
bag number three got a pair of jeans
alleys are pricier these are a pair of
seven from unkind jeans I'm actually
wearing a pair now if I saw these and
thought these were rather gorgeous too
I love the fit of things once I'm
wearing to follow my getting pair what
was black gray some cut up they remind
me a bit of a pair from J Brand that
people went crazy about recently we've
got zips up the legs and that's bag this
is a pair of J brown trousers that I saw
I mean that look up but again I was I'm
not too sure to very me about Lords and
I went to see they are these they're
armed with a good cocky green a little
bit of a utility feel with these pockets
on the legs and two little pockets on
the bombs well pockets to the sides
I thought would look quite slouchy with
some heels and white tea might look
super cute yeah so that is everything in
the hole now let's get trying on okay so
I just put together this outfit this is
creamy white blouse with lace detailing
and the embroidery and also the G brand
almost like utility trousers I suppose I
was putting with heels yeah
really like you actually I mean I kind
of wish that this a little bit more
cinched in I feel like it's a little bit
open
I might cease to have smaller size
actually in this but I'm so glad I went
full size down these either a size 24
and I'm so glad because these are still
really but comfortable and so I wanted
to sit when we kind of slouchy and can
wear them tables and yes actually really
really like the trousers a lot the
really different but looks super cute
with heels on top but I do actually
really quite like her yeah I would think
about that so I actually quite like this
with the d-ring belt you can really
cinch in pull in your waist get much
more fluttering figure and obviously
kind of wires out the wide legs but I
really like the length of a matching I
think with heels quite a little bit
length something really quite
sophisticated about them elegant
I just really wish it had some pockets
it's an it a bit really lovely it's not
over flattering on the form either
a bit more fetched the other one quite
like it so blue whistles dress let's
just say I'm very hot right now it's not
really thick knit but it just feels off
it's that kind of fabric it's mooched
off more wintery autumn winter sort of
perfect for autumn winter and love the
length like this super fostering really
flattering exhaust has these pockets the
more I use these pockets aren't going to
pull out the dress get this off shape
I'm not sure about having my hips look a
bit off like that I'm not going to sure
I mean the quality seems really lovely I
love this doll adrift from their family
so flattering
I'm just so wearable for those occasions
as well so do really like it I'm just
worried about the fabric how long it
lasts and look this great because it's
that very knitted style and the more you
stretch out the market changes shape
what my to relieve the color some of the
fit okay next I have paired this white
Bardot egg and top girls however it's
also very see-through so you can see my
white strapless bra or dread it's such a
shame to the white it'd be so beautiful
it's really lovely fabric it's off hangs
and floats lovely but then the jeans I
love I mean how gorgeous is jeans they
fit perfectly
I got 25 I'm usually a size 25 inch
waist
so we fit really choose to size the
ankles are super skinny and which are
great because we've got these zips on
them
so the zips are you get in there keeping
with your skinny I love the length of
them as well they look perfect with
stilettos and
lovely patches on them so a really love
these something can I leave just lose
the trial at the little white crop tea
this is super EBT I think it was Richard
about four pounds this it's just news 9
but some of these simple easy just
longer than a short crop tea so it was
nice and watch jeans I don't want to try
on this wheat harvest look quite like it
very Orangi Town shade you like it could
be a little smaller but that's posing
winter of our baby's knitwear
yeah the model clear and more it's
growing on me definitely
okay so these rust trousers there's some
problem I really quite like a lot of
color I don't want the felt that then
you dive in that violence but I love the
color and I like the fact we go right
straight into a skinny legs bottom so
it's quite flattering and I know the
quiet kind of loose and quite easy to
wear makeup synonymous get more tape and
I think I mean the whitey super easy
affordable to put on yeah I mean
together quite cute but I'm just not
sure okay so I'm paired the Bardot top
with some of my own jeans at Gotham
exhaustion spot it's silly fact the
whole these jeans are actually in sale
right now they're seven from one kind
like the other pair of jeans I thought
it'd become really really cute I
actually really love this top it's super
soft summery thorn I don't know
its main vendor the fees and to own
something like this at the same time
it's really pretty then this is shirt
from s3 in the back it almost feels bit
kind of silky it's a really nice fabric
actually I really like the way that the
sleeves are already rolled and the quite
tight as well so they're not going to
fall down clay always love to roll up my
sleeves like this so worn out it's quite
a lot of length or able to easily tuck
it in yeah so this is a way that I
really really like this shirt and that
was everything guys my little well I say
little but it's quite large actually a
sauce on boxing I really hope you enjoy
this as much as the last one I still
need to make my mind up on some and see
which ones I want to keep but I've got a
