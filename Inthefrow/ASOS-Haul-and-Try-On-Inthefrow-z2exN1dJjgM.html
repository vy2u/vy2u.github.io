sauce hole I just couldn't stay away
I just wanted to film another one I kind
of felt like my last day South Hall was
almost a tiny bit of a fail like I liked
a few of the pieces but I didn't like as
many as I should have done so I actually
ended up sending quite a few pieces back
I did keep some and I noticed that the
majority of things I kept to the things
you guys really loved so I think we're
on the same wavelength with that but I
wanted to go back onto a sauce and find
some even more awesome pieces which are
done so this gonna be another a sauce
hole let's get right into this first of
all this isn't bag because I've been
wearing it and loving it and you may
have seen it already on snapchat and in
a few of the places and it is this
bomber jacket it's so cute in fact I
wore this in my Topshop haul and I
mention up II put it out for you guys
this is of course from a sauce duh but I
think this is 40 pounds it's from River
Island but I just really liked how it
was it was bomber jacket style but it
wasn't just plain like quite a lot of
them are had a bit more kind of pattern
to it it's just a bit cooler I just
really liked it plus it's more
lightweight this is so great for summer
because it's just easy throw on isn't
too heavy or too warm so yeah absolutely
love that bomber jacket okay so the
jacket like I said I really really love
this jacket it's just something about
the shape it's just so lightweight it's
easy to throw on with everything I watch
if I'm wearing it non-stop since I got
it
it's just a really sweet shape I love
the patterns you can go with blue jeans
and go a shorts it can go with
everything pretty much like I wore it
the other day with a pair of navy calf
sports luxe trousers it stood up to you
but I really loved that I mean I know
it's 40 pound but I think you'll get so
much wear out of it the big thumbs up
from me and the thing as we talk about
bomber jackets I'll show you and hope I
want to have again this is from River
Island that is obviously killing it when
it comes to this summer I was gonna say
spring but this summer's trend bomber
jackets now this is a bit thicker this
is quilted
it's thicker fabrics it's for more
cooler days definite but I'm really in
love with it the quilted styling it's
just a very easy one you can throw on
with everything you have so I'm a big
big fan of this gold details as well
it's just very cool I don't know if it's
a bit too cool for me but you know I'm
working it this is a black bomber for
River Island which like said I
absolutely love I think it's just a
really great fit it's just quite padded
and quilt it's a something very typical
bomber jacket style
what's so where I've always so much like
today I wore it with a dress just to
kind of like mix up the Styles a little
bit and it's a really good length and
the elasticated waist line so I think
it's quite quick it could find I really
like this I think this is going to fly
off the shelves oh my goodness okay I
forgot I did actually order another
bomber jacket can you tell it about this
is from River Island again this time in
more of a gold very lustrous gold
metallic thread so it's got more of a
sheen to wear and I'm sure I've already
tried this one wants to see with a blank
and I'm sure that the sleeves are too
short but we'll see I've look again but
it's elasticated around the waist ah
skater on the sleeves so it's got more
of a pulled in effect and again it has
gold detailing okay so the gold metallic
bomber very cute love the color and the
way it catches your metallic finish but
this one is different and then it has
these coughs three-quarter sleeves which
was the elastic makes them really quite
uncomfortable it's like it's going to
cut off the circulation of my arm
and feel it's such a shame I almost
wonder if this is a Fault in the
manufacturing maybe or if it's meant to
be like this but if that's the case II
should be a little bit looser
it is literally suffocating my arm but
the overall shape is really lovely and
this isn't kind of bomber you could wear
for more date night nights out and you
know throw on with some jeans
that kind of talent glue to me and just
I actually really do love it I just wish
these with a little bit looser well
maybe if I went up a size maybe it would
be better or maybe I could just come and
stretch out the elastics I really like
it
okay now getting into more of the back
now everything in the bag I haven't yet
on bag please just because I was super
excited and needed a jacket it's like
okay first of all Oh cute a pair of navy
blue shots very sweet kind of cotton
material pockets a bow to the waist a
very easy style I feel they're not too
short either so about what might do I
might try these two on together so these
are knit shorts I really really like
these think they're a great shape
they're quite feminine and pretty
they'll go with so many different things
especially for summer or even kind of
like date nights or nights with the
girls when you swim away like a pair of
stilettos a cute pair of shorts top
tucked in and they're a really great
length as well they're just quite dim
your and you can kind of dress them up
and down and they're not too showy like
I feel completely covered and really
comfortable as well and the air pockets
which is a bonus
next up oh I forgot I love this top when
I saw this is mega sweet cute this is a
pink blush more of a neon coral pink I
guess Laos this cute little peter pan
collar regular length and similar
styling on the back with a little button
to fasten sweet use an iron as
everything goes always need an iron from
a sauce but still that is super cute and
this little pink rosy blouse is very
sweet it fits really lovely I just got
my normal size this is comfortable for
me it's when you can kind of see
everything on the bra that you're like
it's a bit too see-through yeah just a
little button back these stripes
I just feel again I like it's really
pretty actually with the blue jeans you
just go through a nicely with a pair of
jeans again the top dress down so you
could pair stilettos with it you can
dress it off very cute I actually really
love this feel this is a good whole so
far what's next
from fear and mode I ordered this white
tee just a really easy white tee like I
don't know I mean it's cool it might
just be nice and easy with jeans that's
kind of what I wanted it for to wear
we're just like a cool barber jacket
over it a really skinny pair of jeans PO
black boots and that's kind of my style
wrapped up in a nutshell to be honest so
I'll give this a go so this is a white
tee needs an iron I know that I just
took it into these shorts just to get a
bit more shape the way out wear it for a
blue jeans but yes it's quite cool and I
like the fact it already has kind of
course sewn into this it's got more that
cool style I'm gonna like it I'm not
sure if I can find something made a
little bit even more flattering what is
this oh that's pretty
this is a white blouse with a beautiful
lace neckline and cutout work at some
ruching to the bust and a kind of
standard length really nothing too short
and then pretty buttons to the back they
so pretty and kind of reminds me of
things at the moment from Temperley just
that very pretty almost boho Thomas
something quite majestic about this type
of lace as well that is
beautiful jewel obsessed already this is
so pretty
doctor how is it to fit just very fitted
up on top with these more loose very
gorgeous almost bound sleaze but not
quite the same extent it could be this
is just so feminine it's perfect sort of
trends around at the moment that lace
and white blouses it's more boho style
this is the back or buttoned up it's
very sweet
yeah I love this I can see myself
wearing this so much over the summer
it's very very beautiful I always seem
to do these holes and things I think the
themes are based around items I'm
desperate for at the moment so it seems
to me that I've got another white blouse
oh pretty what why have you sent me a
medium large though knowing okay descent
me listen to medium large yeah I asked
definitely ask for small medium and they
give me a medium large this is the
second time now that estas have messed
up my order but okay I'm after a order
now in a small medium who's actually
really gorgeous
so it's by Goldy at a sass and again
just lots of cutout work white silky
fabrics a beautiful cutout down the
center
beautiful sleeves it's almost quite an
Aztec formation to the lacing and this
is gorgeous at the back so it laces up
at the very top of the back but then oh
it's an open back as well see that's
gorgeous and that would look so pretty
on my holiday on Monday but now it's too
big it's so beautiful why did they have
to send me the wrong size you just kind
of feel like it does sort of fit though
but I feel the smaller size to speak
perfect but the overall shape cut and
silhouette this is so pretty and
feminine that back section is so
gorgeous we know they're not quite
managed to tie X I'm not
it helped me but this is so pretty
it's really beautiful so yeah I'm gonna
be ordering small index definitely
anyway
sleeveless shirt okay oh yeah I remember
this looking really pretty so this is a
sleeveless shirt how cool is that collar
if I cannot turn collar fully I really
like that with this almost ruching of
fabrics to the very neckline and the
same to each sleeve each little cutoff
sleeve and again quite a nice standard
length like this with a pair of jeans
will look really cute and also with this
neckline with the bomber jacket over it
will also look rather nice okay and then
this blouse it's actually really dainty
pretty I love the sleeves and that's a
better texture it's got and also around
here it's actually really pretty it's a
bit more creamy than I would you to go
for but it's a bit the thick of fabric
so I feel like you definitely get away
with the white bra underneath this it's
just people know you're wearing a white
bra but it's not big deal cuz it's not
that see-through Janome and this is the
back just a very sweet easy kind of top
I feel and again it can look quite for
month it's been really good work wear
option with pairs my suit trousers and
blazer would look really quite for more
mature and responsible and sophisticated
yeah like it I found a bikini that I
really love this reminds me of the
Victoria Secret bikinis for people after
damn banerjee how cute are these colours
hello colorful buttons so lovely can you
tell in fact yeah the colors show not
really well they're purple baby blue and
white so there the bottom is what's how
did I get I went for size small and
these are looks Lane
and then to match I got the matching
bikini top in EXO and then again it's
got these bands that go around it is so
difficult to show you they go around the
waist oh so it has two bands okay it's a
one band two bands like that around the
back and then this drums
this is nice kind of material fabric as
well so see what that looks like on okay
well this is pretty okay I rebuilt this
swimsuit like I said I would and this
time I've got it an eight I hope yes so
this is a minute so I'll see how I get
on with that but I really loved it it
was just this was a bit to tie in
pulling on because this was too short
this fits much better it's not quite as
tight as the last one it's like it's
gonna hurt me quite as much so I would
recommend sizing up some shoes
I thought these looked very dear it is
these little flats where's this
crossover like bow detailing which is
kind of very similar to the new model of
recent cruise do your line which was
beautiful but yeah I thought it's quite
sweetness metallic fabric but they look
a lot harder than I anticipated
we'll see I mean my feet quite hot right
now it's really hot in this room but
they do feel quite tight and fitted like
a pulley go for his half size up if it
did it but they asked really really
sweet I mean look how cute they are
they are lovely and I like the fact it's
almost like the whole side for cut out
they are really sweet but they're almost
a little bit this somewhat hard but not
the hardest shoes before why my life but
yeah quite cute though and that is
