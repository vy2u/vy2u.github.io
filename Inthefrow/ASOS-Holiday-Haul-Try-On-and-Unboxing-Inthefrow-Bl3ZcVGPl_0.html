of my huge a sauce haul this haul was a
little bit too big to fit into just one
video so I thought I'd split it into two
which means you get a little bit more
information a little bit more time to
think about what items are in this whole
relic there's been this massive blur of
clothes whizzing by so I'll just get
straight back into it this section of
the haul is much more summery so I got a
little bit more inspired because I was
looking back to my travel photos I was
like oh gosh I can't wait to start
traveling again soon hopefully it's like
June about all these lovely sunny
destinations so I got a little bit sort
of summer happy so some of these pieces
are almost getting ready for holidays
and more spring lead pieces so if you're
wondering why are things a little bit
kind of some related holiday related
that is the reason but I know a lot of
people do like to go away in the early
months of year hopefully this will be of
interest you guys as well as always with
this I'm going to go through each piece
I'm bagging it as I go and then at the
very ends of video that's going to try
on everything for you to see so stick
around for the ends the actual trial
yeah let's get to it
first up where shots are first off this
is a swimsuit so it goes underneath the
bust and then over top and a very low
deep plunge neckline and it wraps over
over the back to race our back for could
be quite flattering another piece of
swimwear I got whilst this bikini which
I really liked
because it had that very triangle esque
style which people love to kind of
replicate but I thought it did it in
quite nice way and he's actually from
new look a sausage looks like it's going
to be too big for my boobs but how nice
as colors it's bright white with a nice
navy blue got straps as well I will most
probably wear this as a strapless and it
fastens in the back with one of these
easy fastenings as well so that we look
at this a lot and
then bottoms just very simple easy
bottoms nice sized up with these because
after I find Anita slightly larger size
for my little rock okay I've got an
accessory at options i accessories okay
so but I wanted a waist belt and I saw
this one and it's a great not sure if
it's real suede or not and also the cool
thing about these as well as that they
came in lots of different sizes and
often these belts are too big this is an
extra smaller they did have an extra
extra small as well so if you've got
quite tiny waist this could be quite
good for you but I thought it would be
rather nice to kind of cinch in a
oversize dress or no size jumper origin
per dress even better yeah really light
lines really love the material it's a
lovely place Reuter top oh it's really
really pretty
how gorgeous is this so it has this
almost rainbow embroidery across the
front some rotary all grace lacing oh
and then it's very pretty lace trim as
well but in the back is rather sweet
houses open back a little three little
buttons there as well so it's almost
like an open back I'm a little pretty
little top that would look really sweet
on a nice wintry holiday I fancied
looking like Pamela Anderson so I
thought I'd give it a go and it's worn
off see I have this I think already in
black and I love the shape of it and the
fit of it and how I feel in it and this
one's just in the red it's a nice bright
red it's really they're really confused
nice but pretty much they wear at this
and then this crosses over the front on
set picture stick out to see what the
hell this looks like on this is from
Vela and this is nice since they white
blouse again it's almost a creepy fabric
and it has this black elastic at the
back put a halter to the back together
and it's plunger you neck at the front
and I'd really like this double layering
it had thought that was quite feminine
two large straps as well something quite
pretty about that this I really like is
actually boohoo at a sauce I really
really like the style of it this shirt
so it's white and black it's a black or
navy a white and black stripy shirt the
way the girl had it on in the pictures
it just look really super cute and cool
tucked into a pair of trousers and it's
got the big pockets to the front quite a
regular length to it not cropped and not
overly long and some little buttons of
sleeves as well this is so pretty
this is very very slight spring/summer
II though and definitely for summer
holiday but I really liked it it's this
dress summer dress your baby pink was
blue embroidery on it and it has these
cutouts leaves so it's no shoulders to
the sleeves these little straps go of
your shoulders these little sleeves go
around there
and it's too severe it's a very kind of
short length so this would look gorgeous
over a pair of denim shorts for the
summer as well Offspring definitely kind
of holiday attire though okay
this is a white quite sick cotton just
from Mt WTF SS a weekday quite thick
though it's almost feels a bit lastania
SKU berry but more but more soft and
cotton area but it's a plunge neck fun
v-neck long sleeved it's more of a
jumper feel this really but you have to
not look at it in the picture I don't
actually member picking up happily so
this is a really gorgeous play suit and
it's black with floral sleeves and it
goes down into shorts play shoot play
suit shorts at the bottom but it has
this great cut out the front so the way
the girl had it on the website she had a
bikini underneath and then this almost
was kind of riding on the edge of the
bikini
so obviously you couldn't wear this
without a bra but over bikini looked
gorgeous on the pictures so I couldn't
resist it as I can
really getting ready for holidays type
thing okay that's all the pieces
let's get trained up okay so first up we
have the black play suit kimono which
fits the multinational super comfortable
the colors are really pretty
and I've just draped over the new lock
blue and white keening which actually
fits really beautifully it's really
flattering it fits exactly how I wanted
to it's a good idea it's kind of size
and up so I could fit my bottom into the
bikini bottoms run this over it this is
really put it in a way it drapes at the
back which is really nice obviously just
needs a bit an eye but I think that for
kind of wintry holidays right now this
would be really really lovely super
pretty little summer dress as soon as of
what the songs I feel really pretty in
there it's really gorgeous eye material
is really lightweight and soft but the
kind of thing you'd want to throw on if
you wear like a more summery holiday
quite pretty how it ties up at the back
I don't have got the pineal again sort
of see how that would look and you can't
see it too much which is quite nice
blood isn't ridiculously short again you
could pull it wear it with shorts I'm
tuck it in it was a quite sweet like
that or you could just leave it like
this if you have to get your legs out
when you're on your summer holidays but
otherwise I think it's really beautiful
at the embroidery the sleeves the way
it's cropped I think it's really really
flattering and I will love this actually
just a quick glimpse of this one really
quick peek of this one this is the cute
little lacy
and embroidered prodrome lace top which
is really really sweet actually it fits
perfectly it's quite drapey its crop
obvious if you like props it's not
number four you what the back is really
pretty
it opens up I guess it's kind of things
that if you are brave enough I mean I
swear at that bra again you can wear a
bikini top if you wanted but there's
something really pretty about this and
really spring-like and I feel really
girly in this but also paired this with
a pair of the jeans from my first egg
sauce hole so I'll link down below to
that she's not seen already this is the
we coat off quite thick fabric like I
said I like the fact that it's really
really white really bright and it's kind
of very matte look how was that do know
what I don't know about I mean I know it
needs an iron I'm not sure about slit or
how feel about seam running down the
center there's something really quite
nice about it but I'm not entirely sure
I like the fact that the sleeves also
want to tie it as well how look bedroom
to them so something really quite nice
about it I'm not overly sure I'm in love
with this shirt I had a feeling that was
going to love it and I really do the
fabric Draper there is just really
really flattering length off the sleeves
it's also nice how the stripes mix up a
little bit so they're going vertically
down the front and horizontally across
the pockets just kind of mix it up a
little bit um yeah simple look really
cool very very easy to wear and styled
up or down a little bit so yes love this
one a left we have the white shift from
style top which I really really like
actually the drape fit it's very very
flattering it fits really nicely it's
comfortable
I like this a little bit of a black and
I'll staying here at the back it has
something a little bit different to it
specially I had your hair up you go to
sleep a lot nicely makes it quite sweet
I like the way it just sort of hangs
it's a really lovely length especially
with jeans off rumba trousers but yeah I
really like this is not fashion it quite
sweet quick time interesting the belt as
well officer wouldn't when you wear it
like this but I don't have any dresses
to show you this on we also show the
actual fit a bit this is extra small
which is my usual size and it fits for
really nicely and that is everything
