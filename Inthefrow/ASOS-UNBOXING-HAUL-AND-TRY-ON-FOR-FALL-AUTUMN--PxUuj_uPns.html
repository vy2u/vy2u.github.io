welcome for the first time if you are
new to my channel today's going to be
another a sauce whole kind of for
September October I've actually had
these things bag now for a few weeks
dying to film this haul so I'm pretty
excited to get into this it's always I'm
just going to unbag try on and chat with
you about all the pieces that I found
kind of thought few months so I think I
found a few lovely piece especially for
kind of autumn transitional wardrobes so
yeah this is dive in shall we
nice fun toy pretty big okay gonna start
off first part with this black
embellished sequin bodysuit I don't know
why I picked this up think house
thinking of wearing it with something
new maybe for Fashion Week so that's
kind of what intrigued me with this but
it's actually really lovely this sort of
thing I mean I wear bodies a lot and the
fact is got this embellishment the
sequins I thought could look really
quite nice on and it goes into the song
body at the back just talking in all the
right places that try you can all see
University or after in college and
you're going out or even anyone older
than that want my talk about anyone
that's going out kind of her drinks and
somewhere a little bit more kind of
glitzy glam they should actually be a
really really nice piece to wear it's
cool with the open back I feel feature
so I'm just not wanna brass and hope you
can't see my nipples but I really love
this but this is a real of a featuring
it's very kind of here at the moment
this hope very choker style black feel
but I think it's very nice but it tucked
into black Harry's jeans works really
well just cuz it's quite high here with
the branding so you need something
that'll cover that so high-waisted is
definitely kind of what you need for
this yeah I actually really like it it's
got a lot of shape to it there's a lot
going on it kind of billows but that's
the whole point of a sort style a bit
something to be too fitted I think it's
really really nice weight the next piece
I was drawn to because of the color
because I thought it might look quite
flattering on but now I've taken out the
wrappers I'm not overly sure so it's
just in almost line look lavender blue
blouse with clout shoulders go down
long sleeves I'm not sure looks a bit
twee now with all these ruffles or
ruffles that really cool on the model
I'm going to show now it's got some nice
details in the back actually gets rid of
the top I'm just not sure if it will
suit me or not let's see this is it is
lovely and I like the overall style I
just not sure of it on me I think this
could look so pretty for so many people
for work guess like I've worn it with
skinny jeans maybe not with the rip so
I'll just with a post skinned jeans or
pair of very skinny trousers black
trousers or something nice little heels
it could be very sweet but it's not sure
for me and also wish it looks a bit more
fitted here quick it's quite flowy I
feel for my style it's a little bit too
too feminine and too flowy you know but
very very nice
very pretty this pieces were my
favourites that I picked up and it's a I
jumped suit actually Carly Rowena showed
me she stayed over here and she was
talking me through what she was going to
buy for me sarsen I was like I need that
so I picked it up too so it is this
halter neck jumpsuit in a black crepe
fabric with this repeat pattern I think
these are roses all over it zips up to
the kind of waistline so it pulls in
nicely there and then goes down into a
Plaza wide leg sow trousers at the
bottom I thought she's so beautiful it's
from a sauce obviously from a Bronco
flynn sky murdock before automat be
really lovely this is so 70s the shape
is amazing I know anything in the shape
the way it's so fitted and then so
fitted here and then straight down to
the wider leg and almost completely
flares out I don't have anything like
this I don't see anything like it before
it's also got this elastic 8 back so
it's a bit more comfortable in it that's
quite fitted I mean my bombs are not
quite as amazing as carly's does you
know Carla oh we know well you'll know
she's got an incredible behind I don't
quite have that but it is such a great
flattering on me which is a plus the
only thing with it is this little bit of
extra billowing fabric here but it's not
a big deal I don't think I actually
really
I do like that it's so 70s it's so
different what do you think this what I
think this I mean this is the most
expensive piece I think in this whole
hall so I'd love to know what you think
of this particular piece often these
halls I like to kind of bring you items
that I feel are really quite popular at
the moment in terms of what every store
is doing just to can find one of that
piece that I think you might really like
so I found this part of the whole like
shilling denim jacket style and this is
so sweet
so this is River Island it looks really
cozy really really cozy so this kind of
goes around the collar a little bit down
each side it's not completely fair not
fair but not all shilling inside so it
won't be too ridiculously hot like
they're not down the inside of the
sleeves for example just around the edge
of the opening really boy thought that
was a really nice one in terms of this
sort style I like that a lot
go try some they're going it absolutely
boiling here would you'd like huh oh
it's quite an oversized fit oh and
actually makes me like it more yeah very
oversized fit singers this is my usual
size subtler overall feel and then just
feel very very big they're like too big
it's definite to be my normal size I'm
gonna like it that's sweet but I think
you just have to kind of wear it open
just for the cool sort of style to it
rather than having it shot
yeah fastened up coated and it just
looked a little bit too big without
meaning to with a moment when you swear
it loose
it kind of looks like you mentioned
enough but yeah I actually really like
it that's inking a lot of peeps really
cool yes which is a tiny bit smaller so
this is a dress refrán that looks like
a two-piece so it has the appearance of
a sock cable net jumper that goes down
into a cable knit midi maxi pulley midi
actually midi skirt really liked the way
it looked on the model some hope it
looks cool on me but it seems like an
really nice fabric she's 48 pounds it's
not the cheapest dress ever but these
kind of sweater dresses for winter with
lovely high over knee boots always look
pretty chic look at that go I like this
a lot it's so comfortable it's all
soft fabric I feel like it could be a
little touch more fitted it was more
fitted here at the way and build out it
would be even more flattering but I feel
this is meant to be more sort of a
comfortable feel this would be amazing
for work there with some little black
heels on with it yeah it's kind of wish
it would show off a little bit but I
figure because I did balance in my
normal size so maybe you could size down
and we try and get fit a little bit more
fit to the guest but the overall like
this fits wonderfully all this fits
really nice in it into the sleeves but
this is a really great autumn work
peacefully one that kind of works in in
not this kind of environment it's quite
cool it's quite fashionable but also is
comfortable appropriate yeah like it
next up is this blouse okay this looks
very much like that blue one and so it's
a white blouse with ruffle very rough
cut hem collar again
cutout shoulders but then short sleeves
I think this I think I might prefer this
is the blue one it feels like a really
lovely fabric to general kind of blouse
design nothing that really nice it's
actually very very pretty almost quite
angelic almost but it's a polyester
fabric but it doesn't feel that cheap it
feels quite like a lovely material to be
honest but that just means it drapes
quite nicely but you could also took it
in as well from our fitted shape which I
probably would do you mean me but yeah I
like the arms I think the collar is very
very pretty very flattering keyhole back
yeah what do you think do you quite like
this it is very nice okay I think this
style of top I would stick in when I
bought it here is another one so this is
actually from Lipsy and it's a bodysuit
ouch this is really nice it's a peach
beige bodysuit again with that very
ruffled collar style but it goes down
into body suit so it tucks into kind of
blotch against whatever and it look
really lovely but I very much liked
again these ruffles down the sides the
pleating down front as well thought it
could look very feminine cutesy sweet
for date night gosh we've got a lot here
I do
you know sorry guys I'm a really really
big fan of this top I think it's
gorgeous with the ruffles and pleats
like I said a really pretty color it's
very feminine it's very girly and cute
but then also it's a little bit kind of
sexy and you know and we took to my bra
probably look better and I just tucked
it into a pair of my Topshop young jeans
to show how it fits
you got a quite careful because of this
when this is you know showing don't
really want not shown or look like
you're wearing massive pants but
generally I'm really really nice I think
I've get a lot where of this actually
sometimes when these a sock holes would
get so stuck into it and I'm like what
if I not got what might you guys really
love to see as well as doing this to my
wardrobe I pick things for your wardrobe
to guys I really like okay I found a red
swimsuit I've been out to one for a
while and this is love legs very low net
I'll see how it looks I don't know if
I've done something wrong and get my
naked body on see okay this is very very
me gosh that's a long neck that's the
neck okay this is a black ribbed
turtleneck jumper it's just extremely
long that's two sleeve I couldn't wrap
that around me like a scar yes really
really long this just feels very out of
shape I mean I could be wrong but that's
a very very long nap I mean I obviously
you can roll these but how much roll
neck do you need people try not to it's
actually not as bad as I first assumed
it may be I mean there's a lot of fabric
I don't like your sleeves and whatnot
but just it's more that rolled up effect
same with this it doesn't look anywhere
near as bad a thing cause it's quite a
thin fabric it's got a little bit more
drape to it and say a chunky walnut wood
obviously that just beat up over your
head like a ballet Clark but where is
this drapes nice around the neck and
just ask more of a formal effect because
of how much the wrist but you could just
properly fold it down as well to create
more of an actual to it like shape so
really sweet it's very soft fitted quite
flattering
yeah do I like it and the bomber jacket
seems to making another revival it would
name it was in in summer and it's even
bigger I feel for art in this season so
I found this one from a sauce obviously
I keep saying that this is an easel for
two from noisy may go a sauce like a
quilted it feels quite thick lots of
cotton details or colors and also the
sleeves quite cool I like it okay so
just try it on this black bomber jacket
with my turtleneck - I actually really
like it it's got good shape to it
because of the thickness of the fabric I
mean it's kind of hard for you to see I
hope you get to see it now because I'm
wearing a black top underneath it but
that's sort of my autumn style sometime
quite a lot of black on black and what
you're wearing all black yeah it's
actually really quite nice and it fits
nicely I just got my usual size yeah I
think this was actually really really
warm as well the autumn did you like
that oh this is nice oh okay don't quite
remember Guiness actually but this is
almost like a pinafore style juicy it
goes down to very wide collapse the
bottom you can't even see that it's just
so black big there's two straps come
down together at the back into one long
strap that touches a little button they
have a different choice but it could be
great there's something about this that
I really like it's very cool you know a
matter this one it's very creative and
kind of design ladled wear this and you
look amazing in it it's very cool I mean
you can see my bra here I wanted to show
you how it looked like without anything
else on under it but with something else
on Andreea like a lovely gray sweater
this could look amazing I really love
the co-op style latch like it almost
looks like it billows out into a bit of
a skirt it's so draping wide-leg like it
can I try it on with a jumper this is it
with a jumper on underneath it I mean
you could wear black you could wear a
white top put any color you want it
actually sits black this is by the way I
would wear it more so do actually like I
don't feel like it more without
something under it but just to show you
how you could wear it I think it's
actually really lovely just a nice
layering piece for autumn thumbs up by
the time you watch this actually I will
have already been to Paris but at this
point I'm looking for a gold dress
because go to L'Oreal gold obsession
party which again you look pretty like
nap chat and
it this is kind of like me beforehand
looking at dresses so I bought two first
of all this one they only have this in
size 8 though and I haven't tried it on
yet and I'm hoping to god it fits me
because I really really want to wear
this beautiful goes down into a full-on
maxi skirt and these really tall heels
for this to keep it the right length but
the sweetheart neckline is to die for
please please please fit I love this
dress how God uses shape it's quite
straight all the way down it has a lot
of movement and it's so pretty I feel
like I probably will be hoisting it up a
lot something like that some things I
feel like I could do just like a
centimeter off each that I thought I
think I can probably manage it so I
think that I don't have another dress
and actually really love it
little pretty if not I have a backup and
this is a jacquard fabric look at those
colors gold creams dusty rose pink again
quite like the Dixie sweetheart neckline
but this goes down too big
good it's short on the front and long at
the back so it's pretty safe when it's
pretty cool dress so let's give that a
try as well should I really like this I
think it needs a good steam and it does
feel for six let's just feel like it's
fallen down I mean I don't have the
biggest boobs in the world what do what
hope it would be positive but look at
how shape I literally feel like if we go
inside Cinderella's ball in there what
