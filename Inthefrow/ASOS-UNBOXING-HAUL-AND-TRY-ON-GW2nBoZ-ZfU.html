foxhole my favorite type of videos to
film and you guys still seem to love
them so let's just get straight into
this so I head onto a SUP and got two
bags full
well actually got one big box and one
big bag I just stopped entered them all
into this box the only reason it open I
know I like to open it on camera
but I have to find something in here
that I actually needed the other day so
otherwise I've not seen anything nothing
else has been taken out packets Oh
brand-new so let's just go through it
together
yeah okay so um the other day my friend
lived look perfect I'll leave her link
down below because she's such a babe she
has the most incredible blog what Olivia
did and she's also that YouTube channel
it's so brilliant I absolutely love her
video so I'll leave her link down below
she was wearing a denim jacket of the
day and it made me realize I have a
warrant on a jacket in so long and this
trend is getting pretty big right now
and it's a whole like oversized big
denim jacket very kind of funny style
jacket and this one has watermelons on
it I thought it was really cute I mean
she's really not my style at all but
bought hell I'll just try it see what
thing and I thought so many of you guys
might like it too so I would swear that
open over a white top or something
we'll see what we think try this on
there may be such a different style for
me quagmire okay I officially love it I
really like it it is really cool it's
just not really me though is it it's
kind of cool though it's kind of me in
the festival season mode it's not me in
Fashion Week mode you know it's kind of
super cool and quite hipster and that
kind of isn't me but at the same time I
want it to be me you know I want to be
this cool person you can wear this I
really love it thank you guys are going
to go mad for this jacket this is like
brand new into a sauce I think so
hopefully lots left obviously links are
down below everything if you
like it pop that color the ants is sweet
and getting my dad in I'm digging it
digging out I like it a lot
oh my goodness another Bardot I'm not
over this trend yet and this one is in
denim I thought this was really sweet
actually on the website it has these
ruffles all around the edges we've got
quite a lot of texture going on and then
the same on these little sleeves to have
elasticated cuffs and it's all ruched
yeah quite like that that could be
really sweet oh I love that flop we'll
see okay I'm really liking everything in
this hole it's going to cost me a lot of
money now um I think it's very very
pretty the way it's styled this kind of
ruching and roughly I think it's very
very sweet it's honest I can denim style
fabric and he's cute little please yeah
I think that's so lovely it's such a
cute little date night thing like tight
white skinnies and some heels could look
gorge
yeah okay next up is another it's very
similar to the last type but this one is
in a white cream very similar style
Glasser cated cuffs around the sleeves
but this is in a midi sleeve with frayed
edges I remember this now actually I'm
really liking this it has frayed edges
all the way around it's a little bit
more undone a little bit rougher but
then this fabric is that very bright
quite kind of stark cream white fabric
quite sick I actually like this I think
I'm going to like this a lot
then come on to a winner with this whole
guys I literally I'm like loving
everything this top is so cute
it's really comfortable it looks like
it's riding on my arms it's not feeling
tight it is feels really really
comfortable you know it's kind of it
hangs well because the kind of thickness
and fabric so this looks really quite
flattering and it's like the frayed
edges and that's a bit longer back it
fits really nice so yes this is a keeper
okay and in fact I wanted a really cool
hipster swimsuit and I couldn't really
find what I wanted I really wanted one
in red like a very Baywatch style but
kind of thing is he camel around
Ursuline and unfortunately a sock didn't
do once but once because the next best
thing is fine this is actually from
misguided la but this is the style if
you like style but imagine some red how
gorgeous it would be but I did quite
like this one say in LA on it very low
fat I don't you should go for big
slogans and some things but we'll try it
we'll try it I could love it
you know I actually really liked it I
didn't know how I feel about it but I
actually really liked it is very kind of
cliche la but the style like it's very
retro swimsuit style I actually really
really love I think it's really quite
cute yeah I actually really quite liked
it
I think you'd be quite cute on the beach
it's still got that a bit of a Pamela
under survived again oh I did buy some
more swimmer action and really like
these okay this is from Ted Baker black
with white and black like these like
rope straps got this in the sidewall so
probably the smaller size they do and
then the matching bikini again with a
white black roping and it houses gold
that says kid Baker Justice Center
although it looks like that's another is
right where am i right yeah so it's
quite simple but I like the rope
detailing I've got to try that
this actually fits really quite nice and
it's very it's as simple and it's quite
chic and it's just an easy black bikini
just with these nice little details as a
black and white just kind of mix it up
but having this gold here with this
being kind of like a thick band it means
that you don't get much cleavage on the
go so if you are lady like to cleavage
this might not be one for you but I mean
I don't have the biggest boobs anyway
I'm not bothered so it is just this is
very easy simple penis really wish I can
before I showed you my body we got some
lush
these are for from a brand called pinky
keep all quite lighting I look a little
bit too big don't know I got these in 32
looks like a bigger Shore look like a
cover more of me this is the kind of
shorts I'm really into we solve bigger
cool style on the back it says authentic
denim touch to get rid of that LC okay
so the shorts are a dream I'm definitely
keeping these they so wonderfully
like when I was putting them on with my
legs but alas I'm too tight but of
course when it gets up to way so the
perfect perfect fit on me they fit like
a dream all around here is tight enough
so it's not baggy lightly usually are so
I kind of feel like they fit my legs
quite nicely it's literally the most
perfect fit for me ever
I'm in love with these Hey oh and listen
to it
I forgot I got this but I love this
especially this is for a brand called
Jade in London and years ago when I
first started blogging I actually went
Jade in London on a photo shoot I also
want to send you look what's it's so
much fun I said I've got a bit a lot of
us friend how beautiful is this swimsuit
seriously guys so gorgeous and I love
the higher neck I think I'll be really
really sexy on actually what size do I
get this in got this in size 6 I use a
little a little bit more expensive
it's obviously slightly high quality
it's an individual brand independent
brand let's see what it's like okay I am
officially in love with a swimsuit this
is so beautiful it is so flattering as
well it's beautiful it fits really well
this is the back gorgeous back to then
and it just fits like really really well
the way you'd want a swimsuit to fit
really no love sorry again my mirror is
just here so I can kind of like look at
myself I'm speaking to you and give you
like too much you looking at yeah I
absolutely will love it fit cut the
colours so so pretty
another pair of trousers these are a
sauces own all these look too big these
are uk6
too big for men these are navy with a
brownie red burgundy striping going our
way down and look at pinstripe tailored
style supposed to be quite answer the
white shirt maybe and some high heels
that kind of power dressing styling so
the trails it's actually fit really
really nice I'll just fit around the
bottoms my waist on to my hips just very
comfortable I think with a pair of like
some heels on with them would be
wonderful for work actually they're
great soft work trouser I mean I've just
left it armoured to blue top but you
could just as easily I can ice cream top
on with it would look really sweet yeah
music and trousers that I would wear to
an office color environment or let's
just wear some heels a cute little top
of them and a jacket for shopping or
days out you know I think these kind of
suit pants are so versatile these days
you don't necessarily have to wear
tailored pieces to work environments you
can wear them or ever you like for
whatever you like and I think they're
really quite sweet and Alex just like
them too so double dot I also got some
necklaces this is a suede and Segar cute
little choker in a beige leather with a
cute gold feather on it I'll be honest
at the moment I still have acrylics on I
need to get these off so badly
so I'm find it very difficult to undo
and do up and make it cute really cute
so this is what it looks like on I think
it's actually really adorable again it's
sort of really tight to my necks it fits
away a choker should it's very sweet
actually just depends on your outfit I
guess if you want to wear a black
chokers you want to wear and more beige
choker like it's super kind of boho
sweet this is perfect for festivals as
is this actually I also want to try out
this choke as well so for a reclaimed
vintage hey sass me chokers are huge
now so I thought I'll try a few and this
is just like a band again but with a a
wiggly line made in cotton I'm sure I'm
not going to feel like this I thought
give it a go see how I mean this could
look super cool with the denim jacket
problm short kind of denim on denim very
cool lot I just don't know if I can pull
off super cool this is the choker and
just put it on with this swimsuit but
it'd look really sweet I actually really
like it I don't own anything like this
usually I go for very kind of pretty
delicate jewelry you know like Silver's
that kind of thinks this is quite
different but it fits really well just a
little clip at the back and it does yeah
fits away ain't wanna choke or two and
it looks really cute with the high neck
of this as well yes like and the last
pieces I'm not too sure I'm looking at
them in here well it's a cohort like
each step so this has a top it is quite
sweet actually coming out it's lace with
a very ruched cotton white fabric lace
trim to the bottom actually it's really
pretty detailing on this so that is a
top and it comes with the matching
shorts which look extremely see-through
this is kind of thing you've left to
wear a bikini to get away with it but
otherwise it is actually very pretty
that lace is gorgeous round bottom so
that's a cute little set right now
okay so this is actually super cute very
see-through as I expected but over
bikini think it look quite sweet
actually
it's beautiful lace it's a cute little
soft beachwear material you know and it
does look adorable
it's went through to Alex and this it is
I only you look you okay yeah it is
SuperDuper see-through like you need a
bikini on underneath this or very new
Nick as we could still be able to see
that definitely but it's like a little
through one on the beach it's actually
really adorable okay guys so that is the
end of another a soft whole really
