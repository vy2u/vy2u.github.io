favorite favorite videos to film I know
so many of you guys love these videos
when I made them so I thought it's about
time I got down to it and did a full on
a sauce try on haul so I got a little
bit spendy on a sass got a few new
pieces that I found I thought were
really gorgeous and really great for
sort of summer holidays kind of late
spring summer holidays are we even in
summer yet probably technically yes so I
went a little bit spendy and I found a
few things I thought you guys might like
to so as always I'm gonna unbox go
through everything and then I'm gonna
try on as we go so let's get started the
first thing is a box only because I
bought this today before my big parcel
arrived because I was going to wear it
for a night out and I didn't realize
just how kind of summer it was it just
was not right at all so at night hours
so this is the first piece I got this is
a peach placing from Villa de saucé
it's that sort of very jersey fabric
with a lace up crochet overlay layer so
looks almost like you're wearing a
cohort op with some of shorts which is
really quite cute and at the back it's
pulled together by this strap that
touches to the two straps on either side
so it keeps these on your shoulders
which is quite nice yeah I thought the
color was beautiful and definitely for
summer holidays is one of those things
you can throw on every single day and
just feel super comfy in it so let's try
it on okay first up this needs a bit of
a iron definitely oh I think from
holidays this would be so easy to wear
really comfortable by the way did you
see the look from here
I've got a mirror literally right behind
the camera just hook up some speed I
like something sex and chat to you about
it yes it's really comfy such as
material it looks yeah and the fun of
this it's really sweet and really easy
next up is the box so let's get into
this and see okay I'm just gonna snap
the top and go through each piece so
it's based off um white little shorts
thought these were super cute I like the
turn ups alike that they looked as so I
think wouldn't going to show too much
have your bomb but we'll see when I try
these on these literally look like
they're made for babies so tiny I don't
think I'm gonna be able to fit in these
what size it I buy extra small it'll
actually looked like a size four I'll
try them though wait so the really
lovely fabric they're not too thin but
also not too heavy denim but they look
like little denim shorts and they're
from a brand called jackeline DeYoung
cute and just so we've got more of an
outfit for me to show you I'm gonna try
those on with something else so this is
kids eyes this is from supertrash Oh
static this is from super trash and it's
a grey jersey it's a little bit more
knitwear that I even imagined it would
be it's definitely knitted it's not like
a knitted Jersey grey slouchy top its
kind of thing that I wear so regularly
and just go out in if I'm going like for
brunch I come back to shops often what's
hanging around the house like I just
love these kind of tops it is so easy to
wear they're comfortable they kind of
look really kind of chilled out vibe I
just like the look of what it looks like
you've made no effort or but look really
put together and that's what I thought
this would be so want to try that on
with the white shorts total of this gray
top this is my kind of gray top it's
just so comfy so easy to throw on with
anything and that's quite cool I mean
I've got a white bra on with it now
which isn't too bad I think black bra
they will seal a bit more so a new draft
play the one to go
like this I say I leave it's black it's
up to you the white shorts fit me
somehow but they literally feel like hot
pants but look how tight they are and
yes I am wearing a black black underwear
sorry about that but I just want to kind
of do the test to see how thick they
were and yes you can't see black
underwear underneath them and also I
hate the fact that these are so pockets
they're in our pockets here and I really
want it to be pockets
yeah they literally feel like hot pants
on me and they're not that flattering so
I'm not sure but I mean I don't know I
think maybe fell when it size up might
be a bit nicer but an answer here I
don't know anyway I really really really
like this great top um yeah I think it's
we super easy one to kind of pop with
some jeans heels
that's quite sloppy and slouchy next up
I bought a hat no I'm not really a hat
person and I want to get more into have
and I do like wearing cats when I'm on
holiday because I definitely need to
protect my white hair or outsource girls
yellow green so I thought I'd pick up a
new hat and this was really quite sweet
I like the fact that it was more kind of
angular than the Shelby style I like the
fact just kind of straight on top quite
sick I mean thing is that it's been like
bent in the box
it's like bending back so I'll try that
on with the last outfit and see how we
go and this is the Hat I actually like
it I don't usually like hats and it is
it was either between small or medium
and I went for small although usually
I'd go for a medium Czar's
kind of dicing with it there but it fits
and it's kind of the right fit it's
almost a little bit tight so that it's
not going to come off if it's breathing
which is quite good and I really like it
I like the style I think it's super cute
actually
do I look like a sombrero is it I don't
know I do I think I really like this
okay let me know if you think this house
suits me uh knocks I'm not sure I think
I like it
next up
a swimming costume I saw I thought this
was really beautiful actually I'm really
quite unique and this is it's like a
necklace it goes into two sections
that's cut into a large be at the front
and then a completely open back but how
gorgeous is this seriously I mean how
did you even get this on okay so that
kind of opens up so you can get back on
but I thought that was really gorgeous
and really quite sophisticated and sexy
I just went for usual UK size six and
this I also picked up a cord that
unfortunately the pot wasn't available
in my size but I still really liked it
so I thought I would order it anyway
just see what it look like and then if I
really liked it I just buy it in small
sacks so but the shorts are in my size
so they're a peachy called short with
this almost like a scalloped stitching
all around the edges of the pockets and
around the hem and elasticated waist
line so this looked really comfortable
very easy breezy for on holiday how cute
is that color so I also bought that with
the matching top so matching top I have
to get in a size ten but like I said if
I really really like house buy it a
little bit smaller but this is almost a
cropped Bardot style top with keep
little straps and it ties just for the
top for this little added detail they
just have some embroidery in black going
down the front to match the scalloped
edging on it the thought this would be
really quite sweet so let's get that try
okay so with this one I've had to really
pull the shot so this isn't too short to
make more of a code style yeah I mean
knows I bought this from the wrong size
and maybe a few sizes found it better
and it's lovely and it's super cute I've
also had parts of new knickers with this
because the black just show through
ridiculously well it's very pretty you
don't if it's a bit too neon peach for
me I'm not too sure but still very Q and
I think somebody would look so gorgeous
in this they'll have a little set I'm
not sure about it on me what do you
think I'm not sure about this neon coral
on me but really pretty features
okay now everything else in here is a
top apart from this
a new pair of high-waisted shorts and
start this color was quite sweet and
very very blue but looking at these now
they look quite long I'm not sure if I
wanted them this long I mean could I
turn them off from often somebody
extreme Chinese arts or a bit more I
really like that color that color is
super cute okay so for talks this is
very thought of Norwegian meets Austrian
vibes very traditional obviously
Austrian baobabs very frizzy floral
embroider down front cut out almost like
crochet knit cut outs cute little bow to
the front it's got open back again with
this embroidered crochet style cutout
work and the kind of fringing to the
bottom I mean how sweet is this this is
from a brand called Sunday's love in
some days living I saw it give it a try
so I try that on
with the shorts this is mega cute like
really really cute
that's not if it's a bit twee for me
that keeps really sweet and blue wear it
quite often although you can't see my
browser back which isn't great because I
think they couldn't wear a bra that you
probably would be able to see nipples
let's be honest so again it is that kind
of very see-through white fabric but I
mean it is hard to do anything else
unless you wear nude bra back I'll just
wear a bikini top potentially but these
are the shorts though which I actually
make a cute I think they fit really
nicely actually
I'm just turn them at once motorcycles a
bit more shape around the legs but the
actual sizing in the high-waisted really
fits me nicely
yeah so these are really sweet I love
the color I think it'll go swimming from
outfits so you got quite taken beads I'm
not sure on the top but it is super cute
but don't know if it's me personally I
don't remember buying lips
they still look like something I would
buy those artsy I don't even asking for
this did I even ask this okay well this
top isn't even on my receipt so this is
snuck its way and it's quite cute it's a
white shirt with cutout sleeves how
funny
eeep send that back now this is very
Coachella vibes although obviously too
late Coachella but look how cute this is
a little camisole he's a very kind of
life oh they're our last it's elastic
okay that's cute
okay so it's a little comic so very cute
fringing on it
lovely embroidery v-neck I mean how
sweet will that look with a pair of
shorts for somewhere on holidays very
boho but a bit kind of rock and roll
boho work I like that a lot
try that on I love the shape of this
tassels and Rory
very very sweet I think it's really
pretty I just don't know why it's got
this extra fabric here feel like I've
got like wings almost but then it's kind
of part of the style yeah so it's really
nice and any kind of you could kind of
hide those into your armpits I guess and
it is really pretty that's what she
didn't have so much fabric I do all the
tassels oh and it's a really lovely size
and crop in order to sort of fit right
over the top of these shorts which is
really cute yeah what do you think I'm
not sure then I found this top from the
island which is look another Bardot top
again I'm very much into floral
embroidery it would seem everything is
floral embroidered never mind sleeves on
this are beautifully embroidered with
this lace trim they see embroidery all
over each sleeve embroidered down the
center I've also seem to have bought
everything that has these ties on them
I've not meant to do this happened but
again I thought that with a cute little
pair of black shorts or white short they
look adorable so in fact I'll try these
on with the white shorts let's see how
about
okay this absolutely love this this is
very me it's very sweet artifact it's
black as well I've not seen many Bardot
tops in larger black shade so it's quite
nice that it's kind of everyday but you
could glam up at night there were some
really gorgeous jeans and some heels but
this is very very pretty and it's very
comfortable I think I'd probably find
myself wearing this a lot yeah I like
that a lot
lastly I found this dress for River
Island thought this was super cute
against embroidery but it's more Aztec
print this and style if not a floral at
least which is great this is only 25
pound as well which is really great so
it goes down to is fringing at the
bottom and again it's kind of like
double layer so this fits almost like a
little crop over the top with a lot of
skirt but be really beautiful why
gorgeous neon lime and teal and lilacs
and peaches going through I thought it
was adorable and again super easy to
wear on holiday it's kind of things that
would look beautiful in like Santorini
I'll grease it's so white of the preview
so let's get that a try on 2 so here is
a river island dress I'll be honest it's
quite see-through I've actually had to
put on some nude knickers to go with it
all the wise it was really really black
you could totally see everything in fact
you can kind of see in between my legs
even it's going to vary c3 which is a
shame because it is really lovely so it
is kind of like you can kind of I'm
surprised if you can't see my nether
regions right now but it is a shame I
mean maybe if I wore it over some white
shorts it'd be okay but otherwise if not
perfect we're over bikinis if you wanna
buy a beanie with it that would work
quite laughing oh it's lovely other
cause of beautiful the tassels it's got
a lot of lovely movement to wear machine
it's a little bit sweeter so I'm not
sure and that is everything guys which
