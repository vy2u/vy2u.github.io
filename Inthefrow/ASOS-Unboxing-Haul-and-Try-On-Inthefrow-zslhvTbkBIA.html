long overdue video and it's one of my
favorite videos to film as you probably
know we're going to be doing an Asus
home this year I'm thinking of making
the a sauce haul or a similar haul a
monthly thing if not more often if you
guys ever noticed that I'm not doing
them just tweet me or comment under say
hurry up and get my fashion videos out
because I do often put them off because
they do take longest to do and to edit
but they're also my favorite film so I
just know I need to get them out for you
guys I'm going to so as always this is
an sshole
I've gone to a sausage shows and loads
of pieces that I love for this season
you guys really know a sauce also ships
worldwide so anywhere you are in the
world watching this right now you should
be able to get your hands on any of
these pieces first thing I got hell of a
sauce denim jeans oh really cool things
they're almost like a worn off gray
black charcoal almost um no splits or
anything just nice and simple a little
bit of wearing down the front but I
think I'm pretty sure these are a
cropped leg and I wanted a pair of these
all last year couldn't really find the
right kind of pair and these look quite
high-waisted also so I think they'll be
actually really lovely especially with
the good pet stilettos what we have here
this is a pair of trousers oh it's a
pair of collapse oh I remember now thank
you it could maybe do with a 9 though so
there's a pair of a sauce a sauce and
collapse there a navy blue can you even
see on there yeah and so they're usual
regular clot length so above the ankles
a nice wide leg for more shape to them
and more drape and they fastened up the
side right here and they also have
pockets I like the fabric the fabric is
like a really thick cotton actually
feels really that high-quality it's
lovely
ok next up is
a jumper I've always wanted to do the
whole shirt under a jumper trend thing
and I've never nothing to do it so
that's what I've gone through all its
beauties gone for some shirts and some
jumpers so this is a black and white rib
jumper large white pocket to the front
and it almost goes through blocks of
white and black but hot let's look
really cool on the model and I thought
with a nice white shirt poking out the
top it could look quite cool so let's
see let's see what we think for in terms
of white shirts I've gone for this
confirm a sauce so the first white shirt
looks like this super simple
long-sleeved and it also has a sheer
section to the back top panel and these
long all they're quite nice oh cool Xie
pockets the front too these pockets hit
the front a shear that could look really
great into that jumper or not look great
oh well see and then here is an a sauce
soft casual shirt so this is an in
lovely cotton fabric instead which I
actually really really like this is
almost a litte bit more wearable more
give to it more movement else rest on
your body nice and desist block of
we'll see but this looks quite pretty
also super easy to wear shirts aren't
there no so gosh I did buy quite a bit
mid Stone wash boyfriend jeans okay so
these are a boyfriend Jean they look
quite large out of fridge Wi-Fi policy
distressing down the front to the knee
cuffed legs large pockets to the but you
could look a bit down to though bit
soccer mom this is a grey mal leotard
turtleneck so as you know massing muster
fan of these turtlenecks roll necks as
people like to call them out to call
them turtlenecks this one is one with
poppers and a leotard body as well the
cool
about these is that you can put pair
jeans over these and you'll never be
worried about it riding up you know it
kind of eyes that all of your creases
and keeps you looking really spelt and
slender and flattering but also the high
neck just elongates a neck as well this
makes you look really careful together I
love this sort of thing so I'm sure I
love that okay what's this I love this
color this is an oatmeal shade and this
is another almost roll next out Wow this
is oversized
- lovely cotton fabric really soft
actually nothing too thick but enough of
a layer to put over t-shirt for example
love the color cause gorgeous and I like
that it's almost a mid turtleneck to
that look really great the genes Bank
and I thought for those days when you
just kind of lounge around the house but
still a lot really cute this could be
cooked and it's in humid jumper and the
Pima is written in a rose gold shade and
this is almost a beige pink very light
rosy beige pink but it's a great fabric
it feels like it's somewhere between a
scuba and a cotton fabrics it's got a
thickness to it but nothing that's
ridiculous or too thick as I have asked
you this before that are so thick it's
literally like wearing a bodysuit but
yeah so far it was really quite sweet
from Fira moder and it's very similar to
a black shirt I put in a nice little
hole a while back could not believe how
many of you loved this shirt very very
similar actually so it's a low v-neck
with buttons long sleeved really light
weight but soft fabric a drop hem as
well but does something very easy to
throw on
okay the next piece is actually a piece
I'm most excited about this is from
whistles it's not the thickest fabric
it's quite nice lightweight knitted
fabric and it's really like these colors
so sleeves have the yellow green and
blue white and also yeah so it's just on
the sleeves actually and it's also on
the inside of the neck but of course you
won't see that but generally just sort
of course my sleeves I thought was why
no just to throw on with some jeans
little cuff poor thing - it's like
softer that's one of the most expensive
things in this hole so we have to be
good the last thing is a white blouse
and this is a crate style fabric yeah
the low v-neck a regular length three
little sleeves actually there's no seam
here on the shoulder so it's almost got
that kind of overhanging drape style to
the sleeves and this v-neck is in a
stretchy lasting fabric I'm first look
at it not really sure but we'll see it
on okay so that's all the pieces in this
first section the whole let's get drying
on here I've pieced together this is the
blouse I think from only and with the
plunge v-neck Camilla staying to the
collar not over sure it is nice and it's
quite nice Fitness only how it just go
stretch out into sleeves us know there's
no seam here so just kind of draped off
the shoulders it's just quite plain and
simple since buy it I really quite like
but not too short there but then the
jeans these jeans are nice at the fit so
nice on the form not too baggy and there
are so legs a bit more straight leg look
across to the bottom I'll just paired
with my Jean Vito Rossi co-op's which
I'll also link down there for you just
in case and yeah these are nice I'm just
not only sure on this pocket so I most
like the pocket is coming out the pocket
this loose strip yeah I'm not going to
be sure about that otherwise I do like
distressing I think the quite nice set
in shape for an assets button fastening
which I'm utterly
fond on and on a stick much prefer good
sit fastening what the lines quite
things a lot of outfits so much I paired
the whistles jumper with the collapse
collapse fits so beautifully it like
I've got on the size six which nation
style and the fit so perfect around the
waistband just fit a couple of really
nice pockets in them they're a wonderful
saucer and shape really lovely so I
thought I took this in slightly deeper
shade well this is more of a black catch
later this is navy blue that look quite
nice especially with the bits of color
on there again just with my corpse in
definitely knows this just feels really
comfortable and I'll be able to wear
this a lot and these again fit knees a
bit for Fashion Week I'm a great for
anyone who has many fun dresses but
likes to go out a little bit and dress
up a little bit more you can wear these
so different types of tops crops shirts
tucked in jumpers so here we have the I
think this is severac moto black shirt
and the a sauce denim jeans this fit
like a dream so I've got two pairs in
two different sizes to check these are
my absolute size so if you want your
what size to get I'll just go with your
usual size see what you usually aren't
in Topshop that's not single foreign
these so they fit really nice a lot of
differences in the kind of charcoal gray
color turned up each of the legs as well
so it's even more cropped through that
the crop style yep it really really nice
I like the shape and then this shirt is
so similar to one I got from SP which is
actually now out stock so if anyone who
likes a black shirts in a basic style
then they said probably for you it's
really easy to throw on quite flattering
not to know the v-neck it needs a good
iron but I mean you could also talk in
if you wanted to yeah quite easy and
simple but really like this outfit this
is so sweet
Puma jumper and I understand now why
they had quite a lot of size we have
this an extra small violet net for extra
small so it is almost a little bit kind
of like
oversize style but this makes it more
comfy is really fabric actually think
just for kind of like chilling out in
the house and wants to keep warm or
walking to the gym I wanted something
kind of another layer to put on over top
a kind of bra tops this would be so
lovely I love the rose gold personally
really like this in the sportswear style
so yeah what take it it's quite nice now
this is Rena with your size of the
thoughtography and I think a lot of
people would like this because it is
easy to throw on
it's very comfortable it's a wonderful
fabric it's really soft fabric I've
tucked it in here but it is very long we
take it out depends what you are into
really but the slit on the side I try to
talk industry little bit more shape but
it still is extremely oversized oil
actual fabric and cooler it's really
really gorgeous I'm just not sure about
this for me this is so me I really love
these of the small of grandma second
area light bodies because they
definitely look it's just so flattering
on and yeah they just I mean it's also
extremely tight like it's really tight
around the neck but it's just also to
keep to really maintain that very
flattering style so I really love it it
just looks really flattering really
cinched in I love the color fabrics with
a quite nice I like it with this outfit
this is the easy cotton white shirt like
I said really nice material it's fits
nicely it's comfortable it's one of
those easy pieces to wear with jeans and
it looks quite sophisticated which is
the kind of style that I really like and
Taylor sophisticate style it's got two
little pockets just sweet lovely card to
it yeah it's a really comfortable shirt
where it is so yeah I think this one
should be a big hit and Here I am just
putting it all the way up to the top and
lay it over the black might jumper and
absolutely quite like it it has an
elasticated trim though which means it's
cinching in which is not the can jump
you want for the style so if you like
the whole light shirt with jumper look
it's much better to go for it jump
listen to health assassins down I just
want to see what it look like together
anyway and I do actually really quite
like it especially with it buttoned up
to the top it's quite prickly style used
to go really really liked it and this is
the more soft structured white shirt
also with the mouth kind of structures
feel but it's more oversized I thought
it'd be kind of a little bit more baggy
then I thought slip through the back so
that's a little bit more usual quite
nice length as well it's just one those
easy shares its net but I don't know if
I prefer this I've got one more and
swish the ACE off this stuff came a bit
more I and I mean otherwise it is quite
nice it's a shirt with the jump run
again to the top same difference again
this needs to be less escape it is kind
of pushing everything in which makes it
almost skirt out of it and you don't
want that happen at all but otherwise I
quite like it again with you open collar
it was quite sweet open cover and then
after this to the bottom already like
this start the moment I stood for this
hour and for anyone wondering this is
what the job looks like on its own as
well really comfortable quite a nice
loose fit and I like how the mutual is
not really seen engines like this before
