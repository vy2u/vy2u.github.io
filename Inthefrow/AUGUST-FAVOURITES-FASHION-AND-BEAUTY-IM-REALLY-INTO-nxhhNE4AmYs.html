well welcome back to a favorites video

haven't done one thrill a lot of months
now huh quite a lot of months so I
figured I'd throw one in here granted
that I've been vlogging a lot and I have
been showing you guys a lot of things
and I'm putting on my face and I've been
wearing I guess it's almost like rounds
up everything to kind of the favorite
most favorite things I have been using
for the past few months so I just kind
of flip it around now that we picked up
some things that I absolutely adore so I
hope you may like them too lets us get
right in here with I always seem to like
to go with you too so let's just
continue with that and I've got like a
full box full of bangs to show you in
fact I think it's worth noting here
actually now start this off in a really
lovely positive message probably the
favorite thing of a few months has been
my vlogging so many of you guys have
really been so supportive and really
enjoying blog so thank you so much for
the incredible comments the amazing
support you guys always offer me I'm so
pleased so many of you are really
enjoying them the amount comment forget
saying that I know your favorite vlogger
and that you love watching every single
video and mostly like that means so so
much to me to hear cuz I realized
through it hell of a lot of good
floggers out there in a lot of good
videos so to hear that off so many
people is really amazing so thank you so
much for being just so so lovely I am
really really enjoying vlogging actually
I pick up my camera every day I'm
excited as well to things you know what
I'm doing and we obviously have a few
days they're a little bit build and not
quite as exciting well hey that getup
happens a lot of you seem to like that
that I'm in the house and I'm working
and I'm doing it frames as you like to
kind of see me that more had realistic
daily life stuff which I'm more than
happy to show you yeah I'm so so glad
you like that so if you're kind of new
here or you've not really been watching
my vlog so maybe just give it a try see
what you think so no problem if you
don't like them it sound good but you
never know you might learn so thank you
so much to everyone that has been
watching so so hard I'll just get into
the save let's get the top of the palate
I feel like I'm not showing a pallet in
a while really really dig in there's a
Too Faced natural love palette it has
some 50 shades in here a lot of very
light pastel shades obviously moving
into the deeper as a couple of matte
quite a lot of shimmers from
a bit market about iridescent summer a
little bit more glittery feeling here
you kind of got a lot of different looks
you can play with
I'm usually sticks or kind of lower end
of the scale thrown in a little bit more
of a deeper shade into the crease now
and again whatever can add a I'm feeling
recently I did a really lovely look
using my cranberries and light shimmery
pinks and I knew these two and loved it
and I wore an Instagram and Lois people
kind of commented and said you need to
show us what you did here it was kind of
mixed with these two actually with a few
with the cords make sense so and the
timer's got a big mirror so it's quite a
cool travel friendly pack you can take
this with you and have so many different
looks in here the pigmentation is great
and blend well especially you some are
shimmery shades to make sure you wet
your brush first you'll get really good
pigmentation payoff I'm a really really
big fan of this I think it's a really
really great palette so I thought I
mention it
one thing I've actually run out of I
don't do up these videos it's not I
showed you this before I did for it away
absol of this it's a century spark
avant-garde and I let you just pick this
up in the boots as I was walking past it
it just kind of called out to me to
cleanse moisture bursts facial wash
monster birth to me just brings just
ticks all those boxes together it's
awaited impurities to a skin clean and
fresh without over-drying
and ashes exactly that it doesn't
overdrive skin after you set after
taking off my makeup with micellar
waters I love just go in with this or if
I have also use a cream cleanser I like
to do this is like a last step just to
really get everything off and it just
doesn't it kind of makes me feel like
it's rehydrating the skin as well it's a
really lovely formula got little tiny
little gel beads in there that the it's
absolutely gorgeous so yes if you
looking for a more inexpensive quite a
light gel kind of face wash I'm a big
fan of that I loved it
since I've been talking about this a lot
in the flaws but this is all I've been
wearing as you can see I'm about 2/3 of
the way down
if the because of you by Emporio Armani
Alex also adores the male one which is
stronger with you swim with you person
if you guys are looking to buy since
your boyfriend also strong ideas on
traffic it smells beautiful I love it he
loves it this is the female fragrance
sir it feels very me this fruity notes
in there there are sweet floral note
this is quite not lifting
feminine noting Joseph you're it's
nothing to kind of revolutionary but
this is something really gorgeous about
it and I'm a big big fan so I have to
mention it here I've kind of like them
around up
I'm creams really doing this
bareMinerals skin longevity facial power
eye gel creams it's just very it just
feels very light and very hydrating on
the skin I'll just take a little bit
with my ring finger and pass it
underneath my eyes Nova tart and it's
just a really lovely hydrating layer so
they're loving serum and moisturizer
over top and primers yes big big fan and
fan with so many eye creams in the
market I get very confused I don't know
what I want it to do but honestly I find
this it's been really really good for me
very hydrating after using this I found
that my under eyes get far less soft
caked or drive at last throughout the
day so big big fan of that if you're
looking for a new eye cream continue
with skin to face hangover primer you
may have seen this in my whole life in
Chicago and I mentioned that if I loved
it I probably would bring it into a
favorites video and yes I do love it so
much
actually I don't really ever use primers
but this has honestly kind of totally
changed up my makeup routine now I have
been use this almost every single day
since I got it it's very kind of
hydrating and quite moisturizing on the
skin as well I'm pretty sure you can
diffuse it as a moisturizer as well I
think they can't be duped to say you can
throw this on without moisturizer and be
good to go I add it over the top of mine
but honestly I'd found the longevity of
my makeup since wearing this has really
really changed it's so much more
longer-lasting I'm not too sure on that
filter because of the foundation I've
been doubling with a lot which I'll
mention a second which is a long wearing
foundation anyway could be kind of a
mixture of the two but I really do feel
a big difference for this so I'm really
annoyed at myself for not picking this
up earlier but I truly would recommend
this if you're looking for a primer and
it's very moisturizing and hydrating and
really adds the longevity of your makeup
because I think it's making a huge
difference that was a long one full
highlight of choice right now the RMS
if you can see what I'm wearing today
and I'm very much into this very jewy
skin and I love wearing creams rather
than powders because powerful to look
more powdery creams often set on the
skin and
the net this radiates light so I have it
up here and have it over here I have on
my eyelid Cupid's bow no spit everywhere
just a very cute little handy part I
think I've shown these the socks there
is more of a translucent change which
again just captures the light in a way
I've never seen it's called the
illuminizer this is no loop the
Luminizer by rms beauty and this is one
of champagne rose so I think this might
be like the new one
in more of this kind of champagne tone
but it's just beautiful it's a very jewy
gorgeous glow I use a little brush with
this and then I pass it on and often go
over to my ring finger and Pat it over
the edges of the coat
blend the edges away but that glowed
it's absolutely beautiful it is a bit
more natural and a powder would be
although it's still like beaming and
obsessive this kind of very jewelry
makeup look at the moment now so if
you're after something like that it's a
gorgeous little travel size absolutely
tiring little highlighter but it makes a
world of difference on the throne away
with that for below you have to mention
and in fact I just done a blog post on
this so if you are interested in seeing
the whole new I see a lot of bronze
goddess collection head over to my blog
post I'll leave it linked on the screen
for you with female pictures but this is
the summer gorgeous palette I think it's
called this is a blush and then three
eyeshadows so you can kind of play
around the eyeshadows but much more kind
of summery cool statement look with that
gorgeous blue aqua blue it's like a lash
line or be stunning this blush though is
so beautiful it's somewhere between like
a terracotta rosy Coral I'd say it's a
bit more kind of bullshi skin tone than
that though what would these really deep
tones I have it on today and I just work
it over the top of my across my cheeks
to blend it with my and my
highlight and it's an absolutely
beautiful shade but it's very pigmented
so very light hand is all you need since
of going last for ages but I really love
this color if you decided you just call
out I was like this is what I've been
looking for for a long time
plus the packaging of this is absolutely
stunning so to see Estee Lauder and
limited-edition summer collection so
going to look this soon it's not less
and links down below as well obviously
you can get all these products as well
another palace to mention is the copper
glow by T Boren I got their foot again
always get it personally you may have
seen my Korean beauty kind of pole and
makeover I'll leave that link on the
screen eccentric
that video and it was such a pleasure
working with boring on that but since
then I mean it's a lot of the products
that I now use my daily routine but this
I am really blown away anyway I think
it's beautiful this is a proper glow
powder compact for bronze hue so it's a
very subtle bronze hue you can keep
building some and build this up I look
adding it as an eye shadow that's my eye
shadow today and I'll use a bigger brush
in there and I'll work it over the top
of my contour and it's working tomorrow
a bronzing shade I think it's beautiful
if something kind of very luminous about
the powder it has got quite a great
amount pigment in there without being
too full-on it's quite subtle also I
think it's just a beautiful product it
does a little sponge so you can pack it
on a lot of people probably use it as
more of a powder all over the face just
to kind of add a little bit of a glow
from within but for me I just love to
build up runs and especially on the eyes
I think it's beautiful
okay lipsticks choice right now I go
through so many which is what I'm
reaching for the most oh right now it's
a Tom Ford lips and boys in Alexander
which I believe may be easy like to
shake I also love it it's called
Alex it's my face so this is probably
like a shade I think it is it's a very
light nude slightly pinky rosy coral
tones but very very made but I love the
consistency I love that color it's not
shiny but she beautifully captures the
light makes your lips look lovely
implants it's absolutely beautiful
actually and I also like that it is
quite a small travel friendly size as
well this is one of my reach for the
most and taking with me so you seen any
Instagram pictures recently with this
kind of lip that is what I've been using
a few more beauty bits to mention the
foundation of Rome today and what I've
been wearing a lot of recent pictures
and falling in love with is the bare
minerals bare proformance wet liquid
foundation granted I did work with bare
minerals on an Instagram post to promote
this but I was more than happy to do
seeing that I had already fallen head
over heels in love with this I'm pretty
sure this is now everywhere is a long
lasting foundation that I would say I'll
say this is a medium to heavy coverage
personally myself on the other day put
it on their intercom and said it was
light to medium but I would say it's a
little bit heavier than that
definitely definitely at least medium
coverage for me it's very for a great
skin tone I think we have about 35
30:35 colors in the range ranging from
very very light to very dark it's SPF 20
it's not really jewy and it's also not
matte it kind of sits in the middle on
me this will last so well all day that's
why I'm saying about hangover primer I'm
like is it the primer or is it this
foundation by hand in hand I literally
go out looking like this called home I
don't even need to top up the makeup to
a day as a photo shoot I did six
different looks I was there for the
entire day and not once not once that I
put my makeup because it's so so perfect
and please trust me these are so
fantastic and hot that's all I've been
wearing that Nick cosmetics CC creams
there can like my number ones right now
but this is mainly what I've been
reaching for I think it's great and it
all favorite for just my brows I've been
back on the benefit gimme brow train I
have number three and I have number five
number three is kind of like a mid
chocolate browns kind of this kind of
shade and number five is a lot darker
almost like a very deep dark brown I
need to do number three just in the very
front and just flip up the front I don't
fill in the front at all with any kind
of Pommard or powder I just leave them
spooling them and then I'll just brush
this off and out maybe like two coats
and I find it stays at all day I just
prefer this kind of brown look right now
looks at my so Brown more kind of
brushed and these are a great product
for that so don't up from me you'll be
happy to know that fits the beauty now
guys but just a few things extra to show
you that I really really love at the
moment these sunglasses from Dior
I've got these in Bloomingdale's in New
York and I am a big fan onto something
black and sleek very cool and this is
what I found I love this kind of detail
where this gold bar doesn't actually
touch the frame it's like a little gap
here in between the frame and a gold bar
I think that's really pretty I will
leave a link down below or you can get
these because some glasses shades can be
quite difficult side alleys of down
below but big big fan choose a choice
recently I've had a lot of recent and
major issues but I have been wearing
these to death it's kind of getting back
into that kind of weather
I'm kind of girls because I do love my
boot stuffing now I have a lot of these
and I'm so pleased that after buying
these I was wondering am I really going
to get as much whereas I hope to and I
really have I wearing this non-stop with
skirts jeans with dresses huge fan so
usual this Chanel don't know the name of
that for these repairs Chanel boots I
can try and find our wheel down below
what this glittery
it's an emitted very illustrious and
glittery fabric and I love them I'm also
a big fan of this last month of Jim
shark they very kindly sent me over a
few of their news pieces to try out
because I can watch my blog he'll know
I'm on a major gym binge I've go pretty
much every single day now and it's
having all three pieces and I really
really like this design actually the way
it comes around the back and this big
round
I'll wear on the sides and how they've
got out here I've got some jackets that
I've been wearing a lot alot alot this
Reese track it in a blush beige and
favor the bush beige suede I've been
getting a lot of use out of this
recently in a very transitional weather
from summer to autumn throwing this over
t-shirts or cute little shirt this is a
very beautiful suede jacket a lot of the
travels I've been doing I have been
wearing this little jacket as well a
very easy bomber with these gorgeous
satin panel and sections to the arms on
the pockets there as well very very easy
jacket to throw on it's very simple and
very laid back but quite optional wear
it with this choker and a little swipe
tee it's just kind of very off-duty
style I like that styling right now and
the very last thing I have to mention
because it's probably my favorite piece
of clothing I have had in our war room
in awhile
is this jumpsuit words cannot describe
just how stunning this is on it's got
ruffles
it's got mesh it's got slices of velvet
it goes down into a cotton material leg
it's extremely fitted it's got lace as
well it's just it's got a bit of
everything in this it's got long sleeves
as well it fits like a dream it's just
it's just a string I have this in a UK
size 4 because with this round 3 4 I
always find you need to size down one so
I would use to buy you
put in three floor ima UK for so bear
that in mind the UK for its tight and
it's very fitted but it's it's better
than the six for me so it's just
honestly it's so flattering and it's
absolutely stunning and we're posting a
