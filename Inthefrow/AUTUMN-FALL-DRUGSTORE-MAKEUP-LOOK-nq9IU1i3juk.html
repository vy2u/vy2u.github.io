see you here for an autumn fall makeup
tutorial as the title suggests I would
play around these sorta looks now for
the past few weeks I'm really loving
something a bit more intense especially
on the lid with this more kind of
cranberry and deep terra cotta shades
and then it's very metallic deep lip I
wanted to create something completely
drugstore so everything here is much
more affordable all the way down to the
brushes I looked in my collection
brushes and found everything that I
haven't used for a while but it's much
more drug store base so I really really
hope you like this everything I use what
we also linked down below but generally
if you like to look at this and just
keep watching ok let's get into the eyes
I'm very excited about this actually
honestly because the whole like soap
with little Tweety lights and the
autumnal theme really reminds me of
videos I'm used to make years ago why
don't you slip back you meant of this so
look let's start off with the one
product that's probably the least
drugstore here and I very much apologize
just I didn't really have a moisturizer
that was drugstore I don't know how I
must have run out recently you can try
some of the Kiko hydro glow it was
really glowing I see you from the name
hydrating and glowing the name would
suggest I also gonna try this the new
Tanya burr cosmetics face illuminator
who's gonna gain from all the glowy look
so actually really really nice we've got
a little bit of concealer I'm gonna go
in with the Rimmel match perfection in
soft beige and it's quite pinky tone
this so I'm going to use it almost to
kind of color correct under my eyes
because if you can't tell they're
looking a little bit blue I'm sleepy
it's gonna use this Lottie London brush
by the way I've gone for all through
still brushes too I've gone through all
my literally so many brushes in my
collection I went through and chose if
you had not really before and makes it a
little bit yeah so this come back from a
trip with L'Oreal to Barcelona
shooting really exciting project
but she might have seen more of my
snapshot I don't know how much I'm
really allowed to talk about it but it
was really exciting anyway I'm really
tired still from that so I'm looking a
little bit beaten up now especially
these spots have come out through stress
I think on my face unfortunately let me
go in with the NYX ultimate palette
which looks perfect
absolutely like ridiculously perfect
perfect for terminal styles so the zoeva
looks soft definer brush bit of this
second row more peachy tan brown shades
you know the drill
nice little crease pull up I'm just
going to move into the Sigma diffuse
crease brush shape
okay after a little bit of that I'm just
gonna go in with kind of main color I
want here which is this beautiful
cranberry taking that on the looks brow
light I'm just gonna use it as like a
larger shadow brush and pack that into
the middle of the eye is so pretty
where we have like that cliche really
okay now I'm going to go back in with
this more deep terracotta Brown into the
crease used to brush to set up almost
winging that out softly up towards my
eyebrow now I'm just going to go in with
a bit of mix of these two more ready
shades primarily this gorgeous plum and
more the coverage that there Matt I just
work that into this very outer corner
not so much Vitalis
the same brush very lightly applying so
it connects to my own drive I'm not
going to go underneath there it's gonna
go in with this skin tone beige shade
and start to use up to blend out that
edge and for the inner corner of my eye
because I can't always forget that I'm
going to use the l'oreal lapel at nude
in beige and it's really pretty cool on
the ends and in fact for this i always
like using the brush in the palette and
just a little bit of light in there
I'm gonna go for the L'Oreal cushion I'm
a couple of shades nice I'm gonna go for
one and two here I think just mix them
up a little bit I'm gonna go straight in
as well on a Real Techniques expert face
brush I think I've not used this in so
long I'm really excited brought out some
oldies and goodies for this okay I think
this is number three this could be
better
so glowy even like how God doesn't go
away that is it really blends in nice as
well feel cakey you look cakey right
concealer I'm actually so excited to try
this I got this through and was like
this is beautiful
Zowie concealer spectrum got nine
different shades so you got more color
correcting shades darker skin tones bit
of everything in there some thanks gotta
go for this little shade actually looks
pretty good it's gotta go straight in
with my sponge because I don't think
anything is currently spot here right
now it's just it's too far gone I think
just too large and too angry to be
covered and I covered it up the other
day but I try to cover it blue the day
of the shoot and that's what's just
enjoyed it more
that's why it's looking pretty angry
just rolling out a little bit powder
with the Real Techniques
do a fabric I think and the trusty
Rimmel stay matte powder that we all
know and love don't think anyone uses
any other drugstore it's so good I don't
get rid of all the gymnast completely
but we do need to set this line okay
better bronze cushion de Soleil by
L'Oreal it's gonna use that on the qo5 a
contour brush and get a little better
products
I really want face so nice and also for
anyone who's like you've got makeup in
your hair well please try having silver
hair all right her and not getting like
beige and skintone colors on it and if
you are surround one here who manages
and feel free to give me some tips
I'm trying my best guys I'm gonna add
some highlight my favorite highlight
tree match highlight in room C glow
again this is L'Oreal sorry I don't mean
to put for it all being L'Oreal here
I've got my favorites this is such an
incredible blush and highlight my
cheekbones and then also just a little
bit for rosy flush but not too much
color comes off in terms of the pink
which is great but then you can add more
of that lighter shade right the top of
your cheekbones I'm gonna go back in
with my sponge and it's like dab over
and you can come to awesome bronzing up
dog it just helps to blend all the
products together so they're not just
fat on top of each other
okay brows I'm gonna go in with the
Maybelline master brow brow palette and
deep brown
I'm gonna do that on a real techniques
eyeliner brush
I'm an advocate for very very good
eyebrow brushes so let's see how this
goes
to cut at all think I am happy with
those nice dark strong brown just taking
this gold shade here and just patting it
into very center of that lid on it to
top
champagne here
so we're so bronzy and glowing I feel
like if you're applying on these darker
shades it's a shame to be completely
mapped your name so that's why I'm going
all out here gonna go for the Rimmel
scandaleyes black kohl and do my inner
waterline just Omni off the lashes my
lashes this is the l'oreal false lash
sculpt it's just massive
love that the scar alone so yes it seen
there's all we have left is lips so I
have a few options here
I'm because I was gonna go with this
gold obsession color each in plot which
is gorgeous but I want to mix it up a
little bit so just want to use Wario
here so I'm gonna go with it some NYX
liquid suede cream lipstick in cool papa
which is in deep Stoney
okay it's actually really really like it
it's not what I was imagining first of
all when I thought this tutorial but
it's in time I do really like it a
little bit of me really wants to apply a
bit of this plum just to make it a
little bit more for me I'm gonna try it
out a little bit oh my god it's actually
gorgeous right this color is mixing the
metal from before and make it more of a
purple metal okay I love it I love it
and this is the final look I really
really really hope you enjoyed it I'm so
sorry that some of that was out of focus
I only realized afterwards that my depth
of field on the camera was pretty tiny
so I was kind of like in and out of shot
without really realizing where I was so
I'm so sorry about that but we can still
see the colors and everything not used I
absolutely love this look
I could wear this any day you know every
day going shopping even if it's more of
a date night or if it's more of a night
owl I just throw on some wind line and
maybe some falsies and be good to go but
generally I would still wear this every
single day so I really really hope you
enjoyed it thank you so much for
