you're brand new here it's lovely to
have you this is going to be a sort of
autumnal for wardrobe transitional sort
of whole in a way I've got a few new
pieces collected together because I'm
going on a few different trips to the
more colder areas of the United States
I'm going to Boston and going to Chicago
and because I do live in London as well
it's kind of perfect time to build some
new cool pieces into my wardrobe and
I've got a few really gorgeous pieces
that I really really wanted to share
with you as always I like to share so
tamela's really sure what I'm going to
call this video yet but it's something
along the lines of autumnal transitional
wardrobe pieces okay I'm going to kick
this off with a very favorite piece out
everything here I mean I love everything
but these I am just so smitten with
right now and it's a pair of boots these
are pair of tres Rd boots the very first
purchase Ollie boots I've ever owned but
oh my god have you seen these boots
literally I saw on the website got them
off Luise be aroma and literally was
like this is autumn in a boot but just
show up on camera just how rich this
call is it's almost like a burgundy
brown stunning gorgeous suede finger
really like about it is just stitching
effect that it's got that goes around
the boot just add that little extra
piece of detail and the heel let's just
talk about feels so it's almost like a
two totus tour toy shell heel with a
gold rim that goes into a horseshoe at
the back when I got these from Louise of
aroma I didn't even realize it has that
and I was just like oh my god the heels
are cool and then as soon as I came to
had that was like oh my god anything
better than I thought they're just that
a super cool I've already worn these to
death I wore these last week in
Barcelona when I went on a L'Oreal shoot
and ended up wearing them to shooting so
I was wearing them all day and I've kind
of worn down a little bit which I'm a
little bit got back but they have to
warm now to one and it's truly in love
with them he's a perfect autumnal
transitional piece they're just a little
bit more of a statement than the black
boot but in a very similar shapes that
you know that I love to bit very similar
shape perfect whole ankle style but kind
of heel that I like to walk in I could
walk
hours in this can appeals are quite
comfortable to makes it's so thick and
this color just screams autumn vibes
so it's cannot wait to wear these much
more over autumn and winter let's
continue talking boots do you guys
remember these bad boys Dolce Gabbana's
that I've got left
yes well I have kind of pulled them back
out of my collection and I'm making
these myself autumn boot again the fact
is they're incredible incredible pair of
shoes it cost me a lot of money and I
don't want you to swear the one season
and not weigh them again and dodging
Gabbana have around this style of boot
again this autumn so you can get pretty
much exactly in boot but with a
different type of embellishment on the
back I think they've got almost like big
large red roses and a few different
types and if one needs a few times
recently and literally strangers have
stopped me and said where are your boots
from and it just sort of spoke to me and
I was like these boots are seriously
awesome money to wear them much much
more so I thought I'd mention them as
the piece I'm pulling back out of my
wardrobe and pulling into my wardrobe
transitional pieces and making much more
use out of them for this season I'll
leave some links down below where you
can find the new versions of these and
for anyone that loves boots would want
something a little less high and you
like my high boots these are a pair of
Kirk Ida boots and you might recognize
them because they're very similar to
another pair that I have in a suede so
they come in late and they come in a
leather and the wanton leather come with
beautiful golden it must be sort of
plastic but it's a golden effect it's
almost like metal that's been bashed in
with a hammer so it's lots of texture
all over it and a very cool completely
cylindrical shape so they're just quite
cool a little bit you know there's that
little extra bit of bling on the heels a
little something-something and the
overall shape is just so extremely
wearable I've been getting a lot of use
out of these I am sure you know that I
do love my cider bags but quite frankly
there are none but it's going to be more
perfect mate than my new diorama bag I
know I've mentioned a few times already
but seeing as this is all about autumn a
time I mentioned fun this is what you're
going to be my autumn back through our
autumn I'm gonna wear this all the time
I mean the color is perfect autumn
shades art is so stereotypical is that
sort of golden Burgundy's deep reds deep
round you know that's the kind of thing
we also see it with autumn and therefore
I'm just going along
but the fact is this is going to be
perfect it's almost like an ox blows
raspberry shade yeah so if you see me
roundabout we're going to have this bag
off just a few makeup options I thought
throw in here two things that I want to
mention in terms of sort of the autumn
lip this year for me first one being
this one from Anastasia Beverly Hills
and this is vamp I bought this so long
ago now and this completely forgot to
wear it cuz I was into all their nude
shades I was rocking the nude lip for
ages and Canada soft put this in the
back of my collection I have a lot of
different lipsticks threw it in there
and any other day I was looking to do
more of a deep lip it was like oh I
remember this now put it on and it's so
stunning it's much more Brown than red I
feel just so hard to describe it's
almost like a roasted red Brown you can
see that it's very similar to sort
flowers I have just behind how pretty
these flowers by the way so gorgeous
links down below always if you ever like
anything in my background by the way I
always leave the links down below just
so it's quick easy but yeah stunning
shade and for the more purple shades
this is my want to go to right now and
it's what I have one now it's the color
each plum gold gold obsession range from
L'Oreal beautiful beautiful deep plum
shade that line
like I've said before and I'll say it
again the L'Oreal lipsticks if you're
looking for a affordable Brewster
lipstick you cannot go wrong with a
L'Oreal lipsticks are so wonderful so
pigmented not drying really smooth and
soft on the lips so just a really really
great formula so if you're looking for
some new autumn let's eat and my to go
tease right now in terms of a pair of
sunglasses the one thing I'll be wearing
the mostess autumn are my brand new
shades from Fenty how cool it is
seriously that is so cool a huge massive
cat eye effect sunglasses I saw them in
the airport your the week when we're on
our way to Maldives and I thought
come on I'll treat myself to get a new
pair so I've got a new person is to wear
in blog post and yet I don't take them
off all the time we were there but not
necessarily an autumnal piece but I mean
what kind of glasses are lesser like
thick black you know in a bit darker but
for those last bits of wintry sunshine
autumn or Sun which is after my favorite
but it's not very kind of cold feeling
not stealing bright sunshiney face
that's kind of my favorite time of year
I think perfect so I'm going to be
taking these with me on any other trips
I go on a lot of those two pieces okay
and just moving into some fashion pieces
right now oh I can't me show you this
actually this piece hello
chunky cable knit I don't think this
could get any chunkier and cabling if it
tried seriously it's insane I mean look
at this neck on this this is part of the
Tommy Hilfiger and Gigi collaboration
range I saw this online and was like
that is the best autumnal jumper I think
I'm going to find I have to have it but
it's cropped which is super cool it's a
little bit different so we'd like tall
high-waisted jeans her fat it's a super
cool well this high neck is so muscle
with chunky it's almost a bit of a neck
brace feel it's so big what a seriously
gorgeous gorgeous piece and it's blend
not as expensive as you think will it be
Tommy Hilfiger and elaborations I think
it's about 155 pounds I would thought
it'd be a lot more to fun because the
quality is fantastic it's Tommy Hilfiger
but I think it's probably that more I
think it's blo that more higher-end
piece that a lot of people will go for
though this season because it is a
statement cool cable knit that everyone
always long for and can't usually find
the high street yeah in love with this
in fact there's a couple of knits here
that I want to show you another one
being this want that I picked up from
Karen Millen you're the week again it's
just a really easy shade turtleneck long
sleeves really beautiful soft knit
fabric not too thick so it's a good
layering piece over t-shirts underneath
jackets when you don't want to be too
ridiculous there I mean this is gonna be
really really warm so I'm going to be
careful when I wear this is glass sweet
like freezing cold icelandic style days
this is more you know those jake's with
a little bit breezier and you want to
throw it on with a jacket but how pretty
is this overall print I saw in the store
littered in a beeline for it and one
side this is just me and not sure
I love it black piece of knitwear is fun
from All Saints again it's a very
different fabric No - laughs - this is a
very woolly textured wall fabric
literally how long these they're so
super long these leaves but it fits just
really nice I don't know how it always
works I will say this again
lovely turtleneck shape and a it's not
quite crop it's not quite long it's that
kind of in-between length now again I
found myself pulling it down a little
bit sometimes I find I've got like
builders form as it's sort of written up
Samantha pie yes jeans are a bit lower
home sat down so it's almost like that
length in between but I do love it so
much that I can kind of go for that
floor yeah it's a really lovely grey
texture of the jumper okay two of the
pieces I thought I'd mentioned dresses
this dress and while it's actually for
fashion week I got it from All Saints
and I didn't realize I would love it as
much as I actually do it's a very very
easy wearable piece the length of it
means you could wear casual algae could
wear it more evening it sort of mid
length it would be perfect with over
knee boots it just looks super chic same
way that if you paired it with a pair of
stilettos it just look really cute quite
sexy but with a gorgeous long coat of
the taffeta software the transitions it
up for autumn so I'm a big big fan of
this from All Saints it's a really
lovely material as well soft material
and for a bit more of a classy hair kind
of night out sophisticated number I have
another dress and this one is from Karen
Millen and you can probably tell what
attracted me to it the whole lacy vibes
it's very kind of self-portrait I felt
very regal majestic lacy number but it's
so stunning like these little sleeves
cuff sleeves that lace out and this lacy
collar it's seriously beautiful back so
how it comes together up in the zips and
it opens up with this leg and then a
button here and another button here says
load a little extra spaces where it
opens up it's just sexy and it's
gorgeous no war it's the weekend for a
Karen Millen event that was part of
where I had a meet-up so hello - and if
you go
watching that saw me wearing this dress
had so many if you compliment me on it I
thought the colors in this the whole
overall style it just screams autumnal
vibes to that light now and I have one
top to show you which is this absolutely
stunning piece from a sock literally I
would never expect a student's a nice
it's just so embroidered embellished so
much going on is absolutely stunning I
wore this last week when I was in
Barcelona the L'Oreal shoot that I did I
took it with me the stylist fell in love
with the end up wearing it so you may
see these soon on the L'Oreal efforts
whenever they come out this is what I
was wearing
it's a little bit more pricey for a
sauce I think it's around 70 pound if I
remember I got a few weeks ago now but
the amount of embellishment and worked
on to this I can kind of get it but it's
a piece that I find so many people
probably pick up as a very easy
Christmassy autumnal night out piece you
can wear it with jeans and some little
heels and it just dresses the whole look
up completely it with a nice dark clip
it's just like phanpy glam sexy I love
it okay the last two pieces in this
whole whole are the two main pieces
really because autumn for me it's all
about what beautiful coats and I found
too from Reese that I just tilt it a
little bit not worn these yet and
packing them for my trip next week I
don't really want to wear them
beforehand Lauren to be kind of brand
new so here we go first one almost like
a lavender blush pink with a stunning
faux fur faux fur collar all around the
cut I mean how gorgeous is that and it's
the most super sir such as so super
sahab oh wait it's dry it's dry people
don't oh my god oh the Turk moment it's
dry it gets dry I'll let you just went
like this on this no it's time to thank
goodness anyway beautiful beautiful it's
the most stunning fabric super soft it's
not overly thick either so again it's a
good layering piece
that can be to ultimately having at the
back it has this call belted pieces like
little extra feature but generally it's
quite simple and quite plain just with
the two buttons on the front it's just
all that scholar absolutely beautiful
and the second piece which i think is my
absolute favorite piece is wait let me
put it together so you can actually see
it this sheepskin jacket from reese if
you've been following me for a while you
may have seen last year I had the gray
version all in sheepskin and they say
they brought one out in black and it's
much more of a longer length so it
almost extends down second lengths here
silver zips and work on next is to kind
of add that pop but bright still the pop
against a super dark black which is
probably why I look so much it's just
super black but then the sort of
sheepskin shilling goes all the way
around the bottom and the course and all
the way I mean even comes from the back
of this collar it's just gonna be that
snug amazing piece that I wear anytime
when I throw a jacket is like my wall
layer so that's easy day so you've no
flat t-shirts this was probably warm
enough to be honest and just totally
head over heels me with this cannot wait
to get wearing it and that is it which
was your favorite of these autumnal
pieces let me know and if you spot
something incredible in the shop so I
haven't really spoken about yet or I
haven't featured it anyway then let me
