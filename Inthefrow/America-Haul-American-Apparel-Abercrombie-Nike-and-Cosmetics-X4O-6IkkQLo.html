must say of apology for not filming in
about four and a half months obviously
I've been away in America for three
months and I've been interning and I've
been working so this is first
opportunity I've had to actually start
filming so Matt apologies for that but I
do an America haul because obviously a
few you may know I went away to America
three months and obviously in that time
I picked up quite a few little things
cosmetics and garments and a few other
bits and bobs so I thought that I would
show you what I brought home because he
might go into make yourself or maybe
live in America or maybe you have
friends America could send you things
over they can have enough so I thought
that's why I do that's not the beauty
things I obviously pics are quite a few
cosmetic smart starts over there being a
bit of a beauty theme so first of all
we've got two things from one wild one
of them is this blush which is in
Payless and pink rose and really nice
kind of pink white deep pink color a bit
shimmer and on cheeks it does it just
can be quite strong if you build it off
it's a little soft and quick were struck
through on your cheeks it's a really
lovely kind of rosy pink color so that
was lovely
and I think that was about three four
dollars really in the cheap brand that's
really good stuff laughs something else
from wait a while whilst this walking on
eggshells palette and it kind of comes
with three four colors and two little
brushes and it sort of states what you
can do with them so with his feet brow
bone listen for the crease this is for
your eyelid so really really nice again
my kind of color is very kind of neutral
things you can wear over your eyelid and
up sit in the crease of umbrellas
perfectly for every day so again that's
great I'm probably about four dollars
again so super cute I went to Victoria's
Secret now I know we haven't these over
here in the
okay but I've never really looked at
their cosmetic before I picked up this
one in wish and it is it's almost a jeep
for creme Cup by Mac if you like cream
Cup now I barely got any left because
that's how much I used on holiday except
I loved it but it really is just a cheat
for creme Cup and not as the quality
isn't officer quite as good as max cream
cup but if you love that if you look
that lipstick and you want some a little
bit cheaper
this is one you could try and absolutely
love that hence why it's all gone anyone
that lives in Oregon will know that it
is a tax free state so when I went
through there we found a Nordstrom so I
went a little bit crazy on the counters
in there so I picked up quite a few
things from Mac so I picked up this
lipstick much is pale pop and pink pale
pop again it's just lovely
I think call out with it with a bit of
shimmer in it and it's cream Sheen so
it's got a creamy glowing finish to it
if you like I kind of think because I'm
quite sure whether you can kind of build
it up into a much brighter pink so that
absolutely love that Cup I also picked
up cream cotton but of course you think
cream color on my lips now and I picked
up a blush a dainty but again that's
packed away and let's let mineralized
blush which is gorgeous and pretty much
the same as every other bush I will show
you and I also bought this liner which
is the naked liner and again because I
wear cream Katara wear more nude or eye
pink lips I wanted something that could
use a little water
really going to draw a massively pink
line or an ellipse so I got naked which
is a very nude nude liner highly
recommend if women artists like me like
the more nude lipsticks and really
really great shade and a lot sauce and I
also it's an ounce counter and decided
to try the airliner State stylist steelo
maybe it's called and black and it's
amazing really won the best eye on as
I've tried actually so easy to apply get
a really good Katherine wing look highly
recommend that to anyone who finds it
really difficult to draw eyeliner and
it's just absolutely amazing so that
means that I also picked up this Tarte
blusher because again we don't have
chart over here in the UK so it's
something I really wanted to pick up so
this is what I got this is in glisten
and again it's really lovely corally
pink sort of deep pink with a little bit
of shimmer in it again it's quite it can
be quite strong if you climb up onto
brush then once you cheek see yourself a
little bit throw you onto cheeks and
it's just perfect
no really and as you can see it's very
very similar to the wet wild one so this
bit of a color I like to say that wise I
also picked up because again we don't
have cook girl over here in the UK so I
picked up this mascara right now I'm not
entirely sure what it says I thinking
about the lash blast looks there were
about 15 different types of mascara from
covergirl then I got a little bit
confused so I just want the one night
look to it quite good and again it's got
quite a really good brush for really an
instant lashes and combing through it's
not the blackest of black mascara it's a
bit more of a natural on SCARA and I've
actually really enjoyed using it so if
you're looking for a very cheap mascara
to put about five dollars here's how I
recommend it actually ok so moving on to
Pelosi and come to that guy and first of
all I love this this snapback
I've never been to snap back where ever
but going around America with 14
all nine of which were guys who were
wearing snap backs and patrolling who's
gonna snap back and then the girls
gradually started to buy snap backs and
it's decided right I need to buy one so
I picked this up in Canada I think I big
stuff in the band live in Canada
but you can get these kind of caps
everywhere that kind of not rounded
that's not a new era and it's just a
general snapback so five dates fall in
the trip we get to Boston
otherwise I haven't exercised in the
past three months so I decided to go
tonight and keep myself out in a
completely new motivating outfit so
first of all I got these nine trainers
obviously the more of a fashion shoot
than a running shoe so these aren't
recommended for running but I don't have
to do that much cardio I do more kind of
leg workouts not everything stretches so
I ask someone about it so these these
were pretty good anyway
so all she's got kind of amazing blue
deep blue with coral pink bars just
gorgeous absolutely love them I always
have got myself this little gym top and
little crop top so just like Nike logo
on it but it kind of matches the bottoms
of the shoes
so that's color coordinating and so yeah
this is just the cutest thing fits
really really nice I mean I got this in
a small use I'm like in excess but I got
this in the small because it was so kind
of small fitting so if you are going to
buy out online I would say maybe go a
size up if you can and I absolutely
adore this so just wear this with black
capri pants and tonight I new shoes and
yeah feel motivated to watch the
exercise we want seniors wear around
$95 and the nectar was $30 I think
that's also in Oregon as I mentioned
earlier I went to the Abercrombie &amp;amp;
Fitch store which obviously is watching
over there anyway and Oregon is tax free
so it was super cheap so I picked up
these jeans a nice soft light blue
casual kind of dem jeans quite skinny
with rips to the knees right now on them
and these were bargain price of about
$40 because you're on sale and but
there's really really nice quality and
I'll say love the little I've become a
package on the back which is really cute
and depends if you and travel company a
fit shot not but $5 we kind of complain
these are about them $2 each late in the
UK so we got those lots of also know
combi I got some joking buttons just to
care about casual pants around the house
I mean I got these in Oregon right
before I went to Canada where I knew it
would be absolutely freezing so I wanted
something really warm to wear at nights
and 10 so I went for these leaves which
became my kind of pajama bottoms in
Canada but generally just I'm just been
wearing them around the house and it is
most comfortable nice it's material ever
these are men's 1 mm and in excess so we
fit perfectly and they're just the
softest nice isn't it eerie leather so
yeah if you have to some jogger buttons
I had this I've got to mention those
joke bottoms worried about $75 a lot
smell so good I've got me I picked up
this little triangle bikini with neon
embellishments Navy and white print just
really comfortable really really cute
and this little bottoms which are
actually pretty miniscule but when
you're in holiday sometimes you just
don't care do you
things are amazing these were like nine
dollars each jeez from like 30 each so
they would absolute bargain then I went
to American Apparel because it's one of
shops a little over here and over there
it's pretty much the same price as here
obviously an equivalent Dallas town so
it's a lot cheaper as well so it's a
cheaper so first of all I picked up
these pants and now I need to wash but
these are the rain pants in the pink
color I think referred to and they're a
really sweet light coral pink shade and
also quite bright and if you want to
wear bright colors and those good things
but I've just been wearing these loads
just with white ease and little crop
tops things like that and it's really
really cute comfortable and continuing
quiz that kind of cool scheme as you
might know it I've got a bit crazy on
the corals I also got this to address
from American Apparel this was $70 I
think maybe $60 it's a cute little so
draft at the back we're really low back
it's just got these straps that go over
it's obviously it's a kind of dress that
you won't wear with a bra
it depends how brief you are not to wear
a bra or not I'm not sure yet but I
bought a little bundle crop from Urban
Outfitters to go with this like a coral
one and so I feel much safer wearing
that but it's like you sort of thing
it's quite sure but it's just really
really sweet so again with this course
game I found this all day summit
American Apparel hoodie but this time in
pastel shades
never seen it before I don't know if you
can get it over here in the UK you
probably can now and but this was in San
Francisco that I got this
and it's just so cute Scott well I like
pink mint and peach sections and I've
said well it could flow and again it was
not the usual stuff to read a nice
little material kind of thing is throw
on over t-shirt if you go further a
little casual walk out or if it for uni
if your new name and I think it was
about four at five fifty dollars a kind
of usual making a Power price but it's
just something I've never seen before
and it's a really adorable so I thought
I'd show you that there's something I
didn't buy in America but it's something
that I bought
whilst I was there and from the Black
Milk clothing website it is the I think
it's called pretty lights dress and the
usual kind of Black Milk style dress
body can stop time Tyrael and that's
something lasting that they use we've
got this really really cute prints it's
kind of like a skyline with kind of this
kind of sunset in fact through it and
the rest is kind of again it's kind of
the print goes down the dress into some
deeper color so great for night out
anything else would go amaze and they
were dense and that was about 17 pounds
I think
obviously this equivalent in Australian
dollars to about 110 dollars I think
yeah for cents a pound and that's quite
a lot but I absolutely love that not
clothing so that is a website highly
recommend if you've nothing on that I
was in Venice Beach I I went to a list
of all kind of vintage store I will put
to the link down below for this and I
got this really cute little white crop
jumper that says vintage your new animal
house Venice California so I'm pretty
sure there's jobs called Animal House
bar check and I'll link it below and but
yeah it's a really beautiful vintage
crop jumper that they've printed on it's
like that's so cute
like some sure some genes it's like you
crops in that was about $30 I think
lastly I got this t-shirt from Venice
Beach and obviously I don't know if
you're a Breaking Bad fan or not I'm
huge Breaking Bad fan and the last
episode is out tonight I think in
America so tomorrow I'll get to watch it
and I'll say it got it it's finishing
but excited to watch the last episode of
Islands so this is the I am danger
t-shirt if you seem like series 4 you'll
seem worried because I put this big
round it goes on but I have a danger and
it's pretty awesome speech so this is on
a t-shirt and it was pie it's a really
cool company and Venice Beach that did
that prints on t-shirts and they also
deliver so if you love Breaking Bad a
nice t-shirt you can get them to deliver
for you preachy and the t-shirt was only
by $18 so I will try and link the
website for this down below if you'd
like to or yourself want and they also
have so many other different prints so
if you're into these kind of printed
t-shirts then get my website cuz I think
that is everything must have bought a
few other bits and bobs but I cannot
remember now what exactly I brought home
with makes there's so much stuff and
it's really looking about filming and
hopefully I'll get filming a few more
videos in one a week that kind of thing
so I'm working now so I have quite as
much time on my hands you know I've also
noticed it's a bit of a different
backdrop I've moved flat through my
flatmate and some on a bit more central
and Manchester - it's gorgeous all flat
so you just be seeing a lot more kind of
videos in this kind of setting and if
you watch my blog you'll see a lot more
different backdrops to my outfit shots I
can't think because I've now moved it's
exciting
thank you for watching and look forward
to seeing you I'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
