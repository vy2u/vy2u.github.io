favorites I have a few new favorites for
you from this month so let's get started
first up is my new favorite night cream
it's a clinique Moisture Surge there's
something about this whether it's a
smell whether it's fact that it's a very
light peachy pink shade inside the tub
and it just looks almost like Twiggy
viscous gel I don't know but it's just
so wonderful for applying up the skin
it's almost a bit silicon e so it goes
on to the skin and the snakes everything
feels so beautiful it's refreshing and
I'm just really enjoying having this on
my skin every single night before bed
it's the extended thirst relief so if
you have quite dehydrated skin then this
could be the one for you let's just mix
this up next favorite you've probably
seen these in so many instagrams and if
not then you prolly gonna see a lot more
instagrams and blog post coming up these
bad boys these are pair of ray-ban
aviator glasses but I have the club
masters and I have the Wayfarers and it
was to see aviators I felt like really
used it in my collection of sunglasses
and I just think they look really really
cool on so just got that kind of
attitude to them feel a bit like Tom
Cruise and Top Gun wearing these but
yeah yeah love those and they're gonna
be a favorite for somewhere I know that
now next up is a body souffle from and
other stories this is the floral momento
body lotion it's dusty violet settling
among bergamot trees and peony dreams so
it's very floral but it's so beautiful
you can really smell that violet I
really love the violets max it's quite
parma violets ii but this isn't quite
strong as power pellets it's Jessica up
here knee and really light fragrance
about it it's so pretty reminds me of a
perfume I can't nothing on what it is
it's full of lit and this is almost like
a whipped cream body souffle so I'm just
really enjoying getting out the shower
most days recently
I'm popping this on my legs especially
on my arms but yeah so this boat if you
play smell you should go and have a
smell of these bollocks you play because
it smells like a dream next up we have
some nail varnishes and these are from
which we are and these are the lalak the
lac first of all I realized packaging
because it look like pieces of cake so
are they all fit together almost like to
know lecture if your pursuit through the
play Trivial Pursuit you get the piece
of cake me off it in like this really
sweet la packaging but these four in
particular I absolutely adore the shades
that these comment this one's called are
you ready and it's a cherry red you
can't be a cherry red this one's Beach
violet and although I have quite a lot
of violet purple toned nail varnishes
this one is such a gorgeous shade
there's something very violent about it
think oh it's called Beach violent so
that'll be why but yeah the share that's
beautiful greens again not massive on
greens but something about this one near
Vinny's blue and here we have white
spirit I've never had a fully white nail
varnish so I'm quite excited to give
this one a go we've already swatched all
of these and it was pretty blown away
with the closest particularly I'll seem
to fit together really well so I'm
really impressed with ease and yet big
favorite so far next up my new favorite
eyeliner it's this one from Todd fraud
it's a Tom Ford i define pen stealer who
blended so this one's a longer and
longer nib and this one is a short in it
so this one is great for drawing on the
top of your eyes and starting the wing
and you can use a shorter neb to really
get that wing and really precise line on
the go it's just a beautiful product
yeah it's more expensive it's definitely
a luxury product you don't have to go
with it really deep dark black it lasts
for so long and I just really enjoyed
when it on with this beautiful pen is
are a bit gross in a bit of shoving
dirty now but these are a pair of plants
also i got from H&amp;amp;M in Japan in Tokyo in
fact we were in Japan in the week with
kontiki I didn't take anything flat or
you know let trainer esque
so we spent a full day in Tokyo on these
on my Khloe boops and although I can do
a long time I can do a long time on the
square boots I couldn't quite do that
long and so end run into H now and
picking up these they've not gone off my
feet since they're so comfortable they
don't rub me like most shoes with me but
something about these that just don't
work me so I can wear them for so long
they're like seven quid and at the
moment I think they were even in sale in
H&amp;amp;M so bargain and these by far massive
favorite but if we're looking for
something you've more beautiful but also
just as loved my new sandals these are
from tory burch what you sure on the
name of them but course a link of it
down below but i saw these i'm a big fan
of Tory bitch as you know I where the
bag nonstop saw them online and just
totally fell in love with them for the
summer summer holidays are going to be
so beautiful so it's not this just wraps
run your leg and it's fully like over
the top of the toes which I love because
I hate having things in between the toes
and it's just got the tory burch emblem
that's been cut out through the front so
the quite simple quite plain but they're
really quite comfortable it's beautiful
leather I really really like another
favorite thing in the month was being
invited into the river island style
studio this is a big river island on
Oxford Street inside there they've just
opened something called a style studio
and it's where you're able to go in
there it's beautiful and loads of
couches and private fitting rooms and
you can get someone to help you find
anything that you want any kind of out
for any occasion and will help you and
this wonderful ladies like amazing so I
went in there and have a crown storm
found some bits and one of the main
things i found I'm just loving and
you've seen this in my boyfriend tag
video it's from River Island and it's
the denim style dress so it's on like a
denim dress of course lose long denim
dresses are pretty big this season
anyway but this one was about 25 pound a
thing
like so affordable and I'm going to get
so much wear out this for this summer I
come already wearing it so much now it's
not to see through as well which I
really like about it so I'm just looking
wearing these with blimp souls and
aviators with some soufflé on my legs
and yeah I'm allegoria the next thing
I'm going to mention is a favor this
month if not product but it's a new TV
show it's daredevil if any of you have
netflix you may have seen this new
daredevil shows come out each episode is
just like a film itself that ever so
much money must go into each episode so
it's really kind of thrilling and it's
it's really got to hook now so if you're
looking for a new show then I highly
recommend a daredevil and last but not
least but definitely the most favorite
thing of this month and if you follow me
on Twitter and the fro in fact on his
gun as well and anthro then you may have
seen me going on and on about it but I
started a new exercise regime I decided
that for this summer I wanted to really
feel my best and feel extremely toned
and lean and kind of just remove any
excess fat that I had to slide around in
little pockets on my thighs so I started
a new regime and it's called bark or for
non the UK you may know about it if you
are in London there's also one in
Manchester and I'm sure the police find
out all the places as well but I am
absolutely in love with it at the moment
it's so brilliant for both like my
physical body and also my mental state I
feel it's a workout that combines yoga
pilates and ballet movements with a
ballet bar as well and it's all about
really strengthening the core shredding
off any excess fat you've got I'm really
elongate in the muscle so it's about
almost creating this ballet body it's a
little bit more pricey because they are
set lessons almost like a lil
well it's just so fantastic for the body
and for the mind so yeah it looks
something new that I highly recommend it
and that's all I have to say about April
it was a great month lots of things went
on I was really quite busy but I am
excited about May and especially for
June I've got a lot of weddings and 10
pints and things coming up so they
should be exciting months I hope you
guys all really really well and things
go well for you guys to hopefully enjoy
the video and if you did then give me a
light I always makes you feel super
happy and subscribe if you're new and in
that case I'll see you minutes on my
