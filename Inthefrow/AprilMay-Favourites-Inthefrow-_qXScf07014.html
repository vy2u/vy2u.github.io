I have not filmed a favorites video in
around five six months so I thought
today I'd go through a few my favorites
it's technically an April favorites
video but chances are this will probably
go up quite late so just see it as a
kind of favorite sort of recently April
a bit of May and probably the month
before that as well let's start first of
all with sort of beauty skincare things
one thing I have loved now for months
and once a month probably since around
September time it's incense and I just
popped two more got a stalks as they had
25 okay so it's comes in a bottle like
this how much to get you get onto your
48 mil you probably get about four or
five bottle full bodies worth of these
and it just gives you the most amazing
town olive Brown it stays for quite a
few days it just makes it feel so much
more healthy looking it gives me so much
more below and it's by far the best I've
tried so far so I thought I have stuck
to the same facial wash now for years
and years and years so I thought
recently when I had a bit breakout maybe
I need to change about I'm using to try
something new so I went for the Vichy
Norma doom and it's in clogging
exfoliating gel and I absolutely adore
this it's got these little tiny beads
inside it in like a gel you rub it all
over your face and so I rub it in and
wash it off and your skin just feels so
much more smooth
soft clean and fresh well it's I
absolutely adore this now so I bought
two of these and this is halfway through
the second month so I'm going to buy
some more really soon but that's a
definite definite favorite recently this
next one is a product that I got in
exceptive 3 around Christmastime and it
is the laura mercier bath body this is
in the ombre vanilla scents so sweet so
familiar it's almost like an ice cream
and vanilla I have what's been getting
out the shower or the bath find this all
over my body to get into pajamas like
everyone wearing for bed and in lining I
still feel beautiful I think feels so
soft I can smell like a big
vanilla ice cream so it's just so
luxurious I mean the quiet pricey if you
buy them in a big size it's just a
disabilities so definite favorite next
favorite is a Regency room I've used to
regen cream now for around year and a
half in two years and it's really helped
my skin beautifully so I've tried two
serums see how different that might be
and it's like the cream just bit more
gel formula to it applies smoothly and
it's really refreshing and again I just
feel like it's a beautiful base for
makeup so really loving that this is one
of the new Clarins lip balm crayons that
they brought out there's a six different
shades this is my pink and it's looking
to really choose light and evening I'm
not gonna try and many of these cancel
it Bob crayon things that people are
raving about the second style I Drive
and I just totally fall in love it it's
gorgeous shade of pink if you do I make
the morning and start fab age 90 lips
and put this over top you're such a nude
light pink Sheen really my stress is
really hydrating and it also looks
really lovely underneath a lipstick as
well so if you're thinking you're trying
out these kind of chilly stick kind of
lip balm hybrids then definitely give
this a go I think this is just full all
this I love it
nail varnish favorite is this one from
Illamasqua this is called trilliant it's
a bronzy gold silvery champagne shade
that's made of of little pieces of
glitter so when you apply it and you
apply topcoat
it just gives such a gorgeous
shine in the thing I love about these
kind of glitter nail polishes is that if
you chip them
there's nowhere near as noticeable as if
you've got smooth coat on so it means I
often go back and self apply more to
this chip to area it's just to kind of
do it more quickly rather than taking
them all off and then put them all on
again so I really love this and I've
been applying this over over for the
past two thinking it's so big favorite
thing next favorite is this eyeshadow
base from Sigma you may see me using
this in your recent video where I filmed
it from makeup look and this is an
eyeshadow base very much other Mac Paint
Pots and it's a champagne shade it
applies like a cream base so I really
really love this I think this was about
my feelings around 12-pound I can't
remember now but it was definitely worth
it oh I'll definitely get a lot of use
out this I'll definitely be going to
wait up to the bottom with this and I'm
now using it as kind of an eyeshadow
primer as well so what do you function
I'm very very late in the bandwagon with
this one but recently when I went to
Paris on a work trip I stopped off at a
pharmacy finally I've been wanting to go
to a French farm since so long
and obviously I stopped on Bioderma now
I actually got the bigger version and
ivory bought two of these from a
sensuality cently
food about ten pound a bottle for the
smaller bottle
in France I got the larger bottle for
about 15 pounds weight I would say but
they are fantastic they were taken if I
make up what I would have said in the
past about this is completely right they
are fantastic and it's just a light
fresh on the skin it's like using water
to sweep off your own makeup so it's
really fresh really really cleansing and
I can't really fault this so I'll
doesn't take this where my holidays with
me as well I have little travel-size and
yes it my try say but it's most
definitely worth it and the last Beauty
favorite is the ICO liquid metal liner I
have spoke before about the I carolinas
and this is a metal version that comes
with the twisting the bottom push the
more product the top and this has just
been my go-to every single day for the
past few months well it's two months
it's just a really intense black shades
it goes on so easily its weeps arm it
creates a perfect cat eye I just can't
really fault it if you're after a new
eyeliner pen and this is amazing and the
fact I've been using it for so many
months now and it doesn't seem to be
running out just show us how the product
is actually in this so in terms of the
to ICO eyeliners this definitely lasted
a lot longer it's not dried out and it's
got so much product in it so highly
recommend it in terms of clothing there
is one thing that's really stood out to
me this month and it's been
this dress now this is from Miss
Selfridge and it's a PU leather long
color-block dress in the most beautiful
shade of baby pink I have ever seen in
an a piece of clothing
it isn't stunning it's a shape with
adapting on the side it means it's
really kind of fit in four sides but
then opens out little bit more and it's
not a nice fitted round your waist and
your legs they don't feel like you're
walking like a penguin and then the
baskets are cream shaves this is just
literally and vanilla ice cream dress
it's got the pink a pink see it go
through a silver try that kind of pink
from the front to pull it through and
it's a fantastic length I have been
wearing this to work a lot of people ask
me where I work I work at the University
of Manchester so I'm actually a lecturer
so I'm wearing this to lecture in yes
length it's not too short but it's not
too long I don't wear it with tights
because I don't really like to wear
tights but I've just been wearing it
with a pair of ankle boots in various
different colours but they sort of denim
jacket over it a Ronco it's just I adore
it I've been spotted five pounds and
beautiful material and it's highly worth
it so that is definitely biggest apparel
favorite and finally i'm sure that some
of you thought this might have been
coming up but my definite favorite of
this month since i bought it
it's my new
and back this is the Givenchy Antigo de
toast back it medium I was just walking
through Selfridges with her mommy it was
Mother's Day and I've been treating us
to load meals out and it's because she
wants to buy I'm walking to Selfridges I
think because I've been treating her she
was just like Victoria you need to buy
that back it sounds like really this is
not like my mom usually I must say she's
usually like what are you doing so for
her to say you should buy the bag really
was like turning to me it was like okay
I'm going to then I was actually bad it
worked for about me you constantly
looking at constantly going on about it
think about failing good why not and
then it came out in baby pink and it's
kind of my color
don't really say no but otherwise it's
just how to love it so much and yes I do
wear it with this dress so I think that
that is everything for this month's
quite but it's still have not mentioned
Butte in a while it's all been about the
clothes so I'm sorry if there weren't
enough clothes in this video but you
