Victoria video so I asked on Facebook
and on Twitter if any of you have any
questions that you wanted to ask me that
you're intrigued about about me and
quite a lot of you kind of respondents
so I've got quite a few cool questions
to answer for you so hopefully your
question will come up but the background
is different because I'm at my mom's
house back in my hometown today that's
my matter and also you might notice that
my hair is purple okay so I just got my
computer with all the questions on it so
that's my feeling
yeah Christy Jordan asked if you could
go work with any fashion designer who
would you choose and why I would work
with Victoria Beckham without doubt I
think she is such an inspiration she is
just one of the most powerful people and
moment in terms of fashion designing as
well as office her background there's
that she's done she's just such an
inspiration itself people I actually
adore her products we thought I bought
my new girl on she bag I thought to buy
other permits or pink bowling bags is it
just so cute but otherwise I think her
designs are fantastic because she's
always bringing out new innovative
designs or make Jesus amazing Emily
Valentina's certain act do you think
your style has changed all the time
yes massively and especially about year
ago who or maybe you half a girl and a
sister at my blog add quite generic
style I suppose I would just sort of
throw on like a knitted jumper cut pair
of leggings wedge trainers or something
like that and I wasn't overly as
bothered with trends or things like that
whereas now after kind of fashion
blogging for a year really can
experiment with fashion and try new
brands and now I really think that my
style it's completely different
I just wear things I love
attractive quite experimental especially
now I've got Coolidge hair
I've definitely been more experimental
with my clothes and your family often
wearing pink outfits
pink hair just because I really really
love them so doughnut to the rescue
I really hope I said that right Diana
which making palates would you recommend
more of the first or the second ball I
personally love the second one and
that's the one I have because I always
looked at the both of their mouths no
choose between the two and I felt that
the naked 2 just had a few more shades
we could mix up the colors a bit more
whereas naked 1 palette it's very much
about the Browns and the neutrals I felt
like naked tooths have that little bit x
just some things you create some
different looks Georgia asks what music
do you listen to
I listen to a very eclectic amount of
music I am a big well mostly a big fan
rock music pop punk metal everything
classic rock things but then I also love
more kind of alternative country folk
he's still so with red Martinez songs
I'm a huge rise my set fan I think we've
seen if you watch my videos I posted a
la and massive that's why I'm for the
fan
so that kind of rock style like Bruce
Springsteen those kind of bands but then
I also love I love our banal of hip-hop
doesn't kind of thing something I work
out when I'm walking here there or to
see everything for now how I always have
hip up my game or Drake or I Rihanna you
might R&amp;amp;B can style so yeah big big
eclectic to instant Georgia also asked
me what inspired you to start a blog in
fact the first person I ever saw in
whole blogging world was Sammy from
beauty crush for some reason I was
looking at how to store some shorts and
I stumbled across some means YouTube
video no idea that people made YouTube
videos like that some reason no idea so
I found that was immediately got hooked
watch those of our videos found her blog
then realize other people that blogs I
don't know where I've been at this time
seeing if I studied fashion but yeah and
straightway out hooked and and these by
all so I decided one night after about
six months of reading and watching you
know what I'm going to start on myself
it's just gonna go from there
Abby Wilkins asked what's the best
facial moisturizer that you've come
across I need to do one facial
moisturizer for me would by far the the
regen creams I usually use the normal
pot size region cream all over face feel
like get rid of red marks scarring after
is your miracle base then it's just a
hand the reject serum skin regions
similar range which is more Assyrian
rather cream and this is for answering
clean skin jus nation and firming and it
was a really beautiful serum it sinks
its skin so nice
that whole pound Arabella asks me how
many languages do you know say hi in
every language you know hello
I'm sure hola oh I don't know any
languages I am rubbish I did Latin at
high school I think I may let you know
that so some Roman guy comes along I
could totally speak to him Josie Chaplin
asks what fake Tanjung you use a good
question my favorite fake town is the
zentangle Iraq in town I've moved quite
a few different ones recently and I
wrote a big kind of tanning post on a
log if you'll check that out but my back
my favorite by far is the Sun Tan
Rockets on its most beautiful olive tone
sprite the ark put it all over your skin
it the next day you wash it off after
about eight hours of unit on overnight
wash it off and it just like late he was
a most beautiful glow olive color and I
got so many compliments and people say
what tongues you use is great so highly
recommend it's about twenty-two pounds
and you probably get about five bodies
with 45 Whitesburg it's still much
cheaper than getting a spray tan and the
effects are was it hard for you to start
a YouTube channel
not as such I think about a year ago
again you know kind of just starting
with blood and it's about three months
in and I thought YouTube might be really
good way for people to kind of see me
see what like what mannerisms like
I've seen you talking not doing things
because it's just a nicer way of getting
to know Padma so I did a bit makeup
tutorial it wasn't difficult
I just did it I wasn't overly fond of
one come up with because the camera
tackles the best the first time in a
talking video that was more difficult
because it's talking to a camera for the
first time it's just a bit as usual and
gonna get used to that
yeah I think if you wanna do you choose
and you just go for it
I don't care what you say and just get
yourself out there
Shannon asked me how do you keep your
hair so healthy-looking well I didn't
release a video on this which you can
look at which is a how-to pink hair
video where I go through loads of
products I use and I also did a full
haircare routine video as well game that
went through loads of products so if you
want to know about how I kind of keep my
hair a bit more healthiest thing is it's
so bleached out so coloured then go
along to those but generally I just use
a lot of treatment conditioners and
shampoos are really good ones so use
treatment some difficult treatment
conditioners I've used oils to make sure
at the end as well as they're really
really nice and I also don't put much
heat on my hair
I only blow-dry it upside down and then
after that I mean this hasn't been
straightened nothing's been done to this
sister just blow dry but slept on they
learnt straightener I better curl it if
I do Kayla it's only a few weeks so it
through that it's kind of its kind of
lost a lot of split and so I just happen
how does the beach block so yeah
something want to leave it that really
if you liked this video give me a thumbs
up if you did I can even do some more
aspect Tory videos and I just really
liked watching these from other
youtubers so I thought I'd give it a go
don't forget to subscribe if you're new
and you follow me on Instagram and we
set that in the fro and hopefully I'll
see you all again real
I've got quite a few events to go to I'm
going to London afternoon I've got an
incredible hotel stop tonight so if I
could show you around the room and
everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
