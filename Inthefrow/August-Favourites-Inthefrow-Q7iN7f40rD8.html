favorites video I love doing these
videos it's just a really nice way to
recap on everything that I've been
loving for the previous month and this
time this is for August
it's almost autumn winter summer has
pretty much gone already especially in
London it's so gray and gloomy outside
today so let's just recap on everything
that I loved and let's get into it
first up I'm going to talk about my
nails I adore shellac I really love the
fact that was shellac he can leave it on
for a couple of weeks and not have to
worry about it chipping or your nails
looking awful so I can go to meetings
and I can go to events and I can go to
everywhere I want to go and know that my
nails are looking pretty darn great I
have found a new nail salon it's called
dry bye it's in London it's literally
right near to Topshop and Oxford Street
it's amazing they do nail arts at the
moment I have pink with gold tips with
gold glitter tips they do lots of
different types of nail art so different
colors and they are so really it's the
most beautiful salon gorgeous but I
thought I'd also mention the fact that
if I'm not going for shellac and I'm
having a bit of time off a little my
nails rest for a bit
my favorite nail varnish brand is join
sign there no idea how to say this is so
I G&amp;amp;E oz it's wha
I don't know anyway these are absolutely
beautiful I'll leave a link down below
to where you can get them but there's so
many different colors these are just
three in my collection lightest pink one
lemonade rose I wore this recently on
instagrams on our videos I think and
people went crazy so many people said
what is on your nails I need it and that
you think it was this lemonade rose sit
up durov's
it's alder rose there's lots of rosy
shade here but they're so beautiful and
they last for quite a while they don't
ship that easily especially for a lovely
coat off
you know like Seche vite over top
something keep it in place
so if you one drink what kind of nail
varnish brands I love this one is top of
my list you just look gorgeous as well
next up is probably one of my biggest
favorites off the Beauty bunch this time
and it has to be the L'Oreal
professional silver gloss protect system
shampoo this is amazing I just got my
hair dyed as you all know so I went
first gray white platinum I went to
Ibiza two weeks ago and I'll see we're
in the sea air and my hair started to go
a little bit more yellowy yellowy almost
green tinting I mean it was it was fine
I could just about get away with it but
I sort of was like I need to get back to
the silvery Grace and someone
recommended I tried this it is
absolutely incredible this is a very
thick dark purple and all I did was I
quickly just dumped down my hair then I
added this over everything is I almost
please maybe a half bottle this is how
much I needed the color changing you've
got half a bottle of this in sections
put it through all of my hair everywhere
so the whole head tied up put up on an
elective about 20 minutes because I
really needed to strip out the color and
afterwards my hair went back to this and
it's exactly what I wanted back to the
white platinum gray silver so if you're
a blonde and you want to go more white
silver then give this a works it'll
definitely definitely help it's the best
I've ever tried by far
next up if you watch a lot of my makeup
tutorials you probably know that I love
using face Britta's and this is by far
one of my favorites this is a Clinique
Moisture Surge face spray it's almost
like if this well it says this is skin
relief but I mean I just use it as kind
of like a refresher I also use it as a
setting spray so after denial my makeup
might a bit powder it I'll just is so
wow it's a so good let's totally
refreshes your face just it's brilliant
as well if you've gone on holiday great
to take away and holiday with you I love
this every single day I use this product
and I can't wait to find at the bottle
so I have even more a new perfume I've
really been enjoying I'm pretty sure
this is in shops now if not it'll be
very very soon
but I'll let you know mm this is the
chiffon she live irresistible Oh de
parfum gorgeous little bottle lovely
textured glass bottle but this I'll just
wear this before and even Alex's I call
you
gorgeous it's really light and sweet
it's not a really mature fragrance of
say if you're sort of in the 50s 40s 50s
plus it's might be a little bit too
sweet girly for you but is it very very
sweet very girly so even it almost
reminds it a little bit of holidays I'm
so awful at describing scents but it's
just one I will just recommend you go
and try if you see it in a shop if you
see in a boot so super drug or
Selfridges go and have a little spritz
of this to see everything cuz I'm really
really enjoying at the moment then we
have a foundation that I've raved about
before and it's definitely been in my
favorites before I'm wearing it on my
face today it was a mixture of this
shade and 5.5 so this is okay let me
just get back starts here this is
Illamasqua skin base foundation a
brilliant brilliant foundation unlike
many other foundations on the market I
find it's just it's not overly cakey but
it's a really fantastic coverage they go
down to such a minimal light shade if
you are extremely pale this might be one
of the only foundations you can wear
there really do cater to every skin type
with this so many different variations
of colors this is the 4.5 I also have a
5.5 mix the two together to get this
today because I've just and this is
great when I bit more pale the 4.5 with
a brilliant but there's just something
about this it's just kind of like your
skin or better nothing too cakey but
still kind of a medium to high coverage
it's a good really really good and I'm
getting much more into this again now
and the final a beauty product on the
list is a nude lip combination which
again I'm sure I've missions before but
it's back under my radar right now and
it's the illamasqua again I mean I love
it Alaska as you know but this is the
illamasqua fantasy lip liner which has
been a favourite for a very very long
time if you're a kind of girl who likes
to wear Mac well or Mac saw then this is
a different slightly different variation
to go to and I think is pulling my most
favorite it's my most Jews lip liner
that's for sure
and I wear it with there and I have it
on my lips right now this is a very
matte lips
dick but it's just a really great nude
matte lip and those two work perfectly
together
love those let's move into fashion
accessories first up if you follow me on
instagram at in the fro cheap look then
you will have seen a picture of these
boots and so many of you like three two
people went crazy over these boots a
stiff array and they are they new Dolce
and Gabanna sure I don't even know what
these are called but they're from Dolce
and Gabbana for my first ever dachang
Cabana purchase but I saw them and
within 10 minutes bought them because I
was white like wow these are incredible
I need these in my ottoman to wardrobe
this year they were perfect for wearing
to Fashion Week this year as well but
they're just absolutely beautiful
gorgeous black suede boot this style of
boot is kind of my one and only South
boot you probably know that if you
follow my blog I were a lot of boots in
this style very soft pointed toe sort of
a sexy curve at the front a lovely tall
heel they're just absolutely gorgeous
gold zip to pull them down it says door
shank banner unzip and this is all
entirely encrusted the entire doctoring
Cabana range the season it's just to die
for
it's stunning and there are so many
pieces in that collection that I would
absolutely love but it was this shoe
that I thought no this is the piece that
I'm gonna invest in so it's a big
investment a very big investment but I
know for a fact I will wear these until
they are worn down to the ground this
jumper is also a huge huge favorite this
month I've worn it in so many shots on
snapchat or Instagram and everywhere
else but this I wore and so many of you
gained were like where's that from
it's so lovely and this is just a sauce
it's an asus jumper in a high neck kind
of turtleneck style
three-quarter arms and quite a large fit
and I love this style of knit yeah but
it's beautiful super cozy
I'm really affordable as well next thing
on the list is this pinafore denim do
Marie dress pinafore
I showed this in a recent hole it's been
all over my blog if you want to see more
pictures of it's go over to in the free
comment the loads on there but I found
I've been wearing this so much and it's
really comfy it just goes down into a
kind like a pencil skirt style the
bottom with bottoms all the way up the
middle it's super comfortable you can
wear it so many things underneath where
it's a short sleeve top shirt high neck
turtleneck in either a big chunk knit or
you could do it in a lovely thin sleek
style a fabric if you like lots of ways
you could wear this and it's so full of
offing it's like 25 pounds everything
that I've mentioned today as always I'll
leave the link down below so you can go
have a look for it but it's just great
I've just been wearing this to death and
that's it love it and Alex loves it as
well when I wear it so this has been a
massive favorite and the last piece on
the list is another piece let's make a
feedback another piece that people went
crazy for on my social media on Twitter
and on Instagram I'm going to wearing it
on this weekend and it is this dress it
looks like such a huge such a big tulip
princess dress it's absolutely
incredible this fabric is so soft thick
fabric meets almost it almost looks like
a pink match like when you look at it
it's got the mesh effect and it's backed
on like a white it sounds like foamy
it's like so big it pops out at the
waist over the hips so you get that
really kind of cool it out look it fits
to about the knee as I recall you can
take off the straps if you'd rather wear
it BAM down or you can wear it in the
straps if you prefer so you don't want
to feel like you're pulling it up all
night and it's got a zip in the back
just to pull you in but this is a rosy
rosy pink with the lilac and blue it
sounds like an electric blue roses
printed here and there and a lovely
complete
effect it's so unusual it's so unique
and this is from a sauce a sauce right
when I saw it I was like oh that is
different tried it on put the picture up
immediately onto social media and people
were saying how much they loved it as I
yeah good choice good choice so I'm
wearing this as a wedding guest outfit
always best to go large and there we go
