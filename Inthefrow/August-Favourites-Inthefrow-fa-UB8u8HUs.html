August favorites sorry it's so late I
have been away on my holidays and I
didn't have time to film before I went
away or when I was there so I had to
wait until I got back so it's now quite
late interception but I wanted to show
you my favorites from last month
what I do is show you beauty then
clothing and then everything else I've
been loving this month so starting off
with huge products this Carmyle body
sharp waterproof eye and makeup remover
really really great I have taken to
using waterproof mascaras now therefore
I need to use some pretty intensive and
really effective products and it works
like a dream completely takes off I'll
trace the makeup I mean it does take a
little bit longer than other makeup
removers just because the mascara is
waterproof stuff and you can really do
about that but it really takes away
perfectly it doesn't leave your shadows
it's just really really effective so I
highly recommend them I don't know if
you've heard this before I hadn't really
heard of it before I saw this it's an
electric nail polisher so if you ask
someone that has very kind of brittle
nails I was a bit dull then this works
wonders looks like this a little device
like this you take off the top and here
already attached is the smoothing roller
the idea behind this is a bit smooth the
nails gets rid of any ridges or
imperfections on the nails before we
then use a shine roller so you take off
the smoothing roller button to the shine
ruler and then you'll start to shine up
the nails after you smooth them you will
use a smoothing roller only for a
maximum of two seconds per nail no more
in because it really works away at the
nails also just very lightly glide over
the nails
ask them
I think split off ad to the next room on
so this is see shiny other place so
shiny see
so now let's super shiny feel really
really nice silikal products I've been
really liking this it's just part of my
nail routine before I put on my nail
polishes or if I'm doing a manicure on
myself quickly using this often my nails
shine them up and they just lock much
much nicer so that was called micro nail
and yeah highly recommended another
product type of loving is the Clinique
custom Repair Serum this is quite new to
clinic collection it's fairly pricey now
this is around forty five pound I think
for this small product the idea there
behind it is that it's kind of a smart
product you put it onto your face
and it works to repair I think it's
three or four visible imperfections with
the skin so it might work it wrinkles it
might work a dark circles dark
pigmentations visibly repairs lines and
wrinkles dark spots uneven tone firms
and contours imparts Regents use twice a
day I don't know about all of that I
know is that I've really been enjoying
using this it's got a lovely serum gel
hybrid creamy texture so it's really
quite gel style but when you put it onto
the face it sinks in beautifully it
leaves your skin feeling glorious like
I've never had used a cream like it for
my face I think when the de trials of
this we found that after twelve weeks
people notice a huge huge difference
this bottle will only last you four
weeks or so so you need to get three of
these in order to get full impacts now
obviously that's mentioned 20 odd pounds
especially if you're more of a mature
lady and you found that nothing else is
really working you want a new boost I
would have to really recommend giving
this a go and really enjoying using it I
have noticed my skin feeling much
plumper and nicer and smoother and less
imperfections I haven't had a breakout
in quite a while there aren't you late
touchwood let's probe it about three
weeks I've not had any breakouts and
it's because I'm using this next product
it's a foundation now I haven't featured
a foundation in a very long time I don't
think because I haven't really use
anything that's blown me away until I
found this this is the other Massacre
skin based foundation I use this in the
shade 5.5 so it goes with pinpoint five
shades he gets lower different shades
and a lot of people know this product
because it goes down to zero I think
which is a very very pale shade if I
point five is a perfect shade for me
it's most flawless application it makes
the skin look so beautiful and radiant
and covers all my imperfections and it
just
it perfect another illamasqua product
and this is the brand new lipstick which
is called kitsch it's the dupe for
corrupt which is from Illamasqua they
look almost identical and they're just
great pink shades for a statement pink
lip nothing too bright nothing to neon
and nothing too garish it's just the
perfect pink shade I think so kitsch
well corrupt I would highly recommend
and I have been loving them for the past
few months so I thought I'd finally
feature them think I might feature this
next product in one of my last videos on
possibly last favorites video so I'm so
so if I did but I am just still loving
it and it's a Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze glow I use this every
single day without fail now I just love
it it's not like a huge girl and taking
chocolate bar it looks stunning the
packaging is to die for and then it's
got these two beautiful contour colors
inside the perfect it's kind of bronzing
contour shade and also a lovely
luminescent brightening highlighter if
you're looking for a Christmas present a
birthday present or a gift from someone
mention this because you're not
regressive moving on to fashion first
favorite is this bikini
feature this in my recent haul it's been
all over my Instagram channel because I
wore recently in Turkey and I love it
it's so pretty and it felt really really
attractive in it it fit really
beautifully the bottoms are high waisted
I've never had this kind of style before
so that's from ASOS and you can get that
for think it's 30 pound for the set set
really really nice I've also been loving
my brand new ray-bans I find they suit
my face so much but over loads of the
glasses do and the other way fair is the
way they tilt forward I didn't really
like that on my face I didn't really
think it suited me
so I went for these ones here um new
ones the ultralight style so the really
thin polarized lenses a really good for
for reducing glare and the idea is that
the only let enough light through the
lens as your eyes need the glasses will
let too much light in and therefore
course Blaire these will make sure that
you're gonna get the right amount of
light and therefore reducing glare I
just love them they're great they really
suit me they come in loads of different
colors as well if you're not have to
black and ya really liking that and I
think for now on polarize it's a way
forward for me I really really like them
so a clothing brand I've really been
loving of the past few months is Motel
they seem to stock so many on trend but
also just quite generic basic pieces
that you can dress up with lots of
different styles and always quite
affordable as well I have my own Kota
Motel as well which is in the fro and
that get you 20% off so it's worth going
to that I'll leave the links below and
everything for that these are two of
pieces that I really like at the moment
and first one is this one in a lovely
blue royal blue just like a little shirt
dress a little sleeves to it and we've
cutout shoulders you can see touches
around the neck
could have shoulders a little sleeves
and I also got that because I really
love the style of it I also got that in
white as well they're almost like a
linen material lovely lightweight really
pretty material and I took some on
holiday I loved wearing them over like
layering over but body suits and
swimsuits and things and they're just
really really pretty and these are just
two of the things that most have happen
in fact they have this dress in so many
colors and prints as well so it's worth
going to have a look I love you said
jewelry I've really been loving is this
necklace which is your uncle's hot day
but this particular brand is called in
mozi oniy the idea behind it kinda
reminds me the pomodoro in the way that
pandora you can get different customized
pieces and put together your own jewelry
piece it's kind of similar in that what
you do is you buy chain then you buy a
coin and you want to buy a coin keeper
which is this bit around the edge you
take off a chain and then you're left
with this then this opens up and inside
you have a little coin I have three of
these of the coins and they're all so
pretty now on this one I've really been
liking looks like a Roman coin of the
little purple amethyst in the center and
there needs to have almost a little
diamonds to Konya in the center and
really pretty style choose the coins
they're loaded with constitutes round
you can choose the coin keeper which is
what goes around the coin so let's go
for this coin put it in close up the
coin keep her and then just thread
through necklace super easy but it just
means he get customized ball change ball
necklaces every day I'd love to buy a
Louis more of these coins as I've gotten
more of a collection the last closing
favorite is my new bag I hope how am I
doing this before you've probably seen
this in so many halls because I've
styled it with everything but it's my
brand new Tory Burch backpack I saw this
in Selfridges went straight for it and
had to buy I just absolutely adore it
it's a black pebbled leather so it means
that you can't see any scratches on it
and never goes with painted leather
handbags because you will always scratch
it and it'll look ruined so if you have
a purple leather you can never see any
imperfection entirely black a lot of the
little size gold hardware to straps to
the back so it's the foot backpack or if
you want to you can take off on the
straps attach one strap to the very top
and use it as a tote bag and I've had so
many compliments on this people love it
also comes in
but I've been finding wearing the
backpack on my back is just helping my
shelter beds have got really bad
shoulders recently and look how cute it
is it's so cute a little bit Tory Burch
so obviously it's not that cheap its 430
pounds but not too bad I don't think for
designer handbag and one that I have
used religiously every single day since
and will continue to use it and it will
last me forever so yeah love this so my
random favourites I've got first one is
the L collections magazine
I adore our collections I have collected
every single one of these we come out by
and your list you get to in year each
one for each of the clothing seasons so
got autumn and ten also spring/summer so
this is a rundown of everything that
happened at the last London Fashion Week
and it just gives you the perfect from
down everything stickers in it and it
just shows you all of the catwalk pieces
a few too little articles in there I
want you should be wearing and breaks
down and all the trends as well and are
different Browns so I'm from the Queen
obviously doing now berberine it shows
you the entire collection laid out with
all models wearing the pieces so these
are great I mean in about seven pound
magazine but they're really quite
substantial and collection pieces one
last favorite I thought I would feature
is a new piece of artwork that I have
it's from a French brand I think I'll
leave the links down below friend for
the actual brand today when I'll leave
it on the screen as well cuz I can't
quite over now but they have such a
great collection of prints and also
decals stickers and things like that and
I also have my own
discount code for that the hair is on my
wall it's beautiful
some of you may know that I have and a
lot of smaller set tattoo that says you
live you learn so something about this
this will ever learn that I really
really liked and then it has this little
detailing here losing few feathers won't
stop you from flying and I just thought
it was really really quite sweet this is
a reproduction of the original piece
that was made and I also got a great
frame from it
fitted perfectly and it's a really
statement piece of artwork love the
lettering and typography in it and it's
really really loved it so that's been a
massive favorite of mine recently - a
little bit of everything in there I
really hope you enjoyed it that's just a
little rundown of everything I've been
loving this month again I'm really sorry
it's so late but at least it's late
rather than never hope that it's
somewhat helpful and hopefully you liked
it so give me a good old thumbs up if
you did and make sure to subscribe if
you're new that'd be awesome and I'll
see you all really really soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
