type of video I've been thinking about
filming this for a while and I figured
today I just go for it this is going to
be call my monthly love list so if it's
July its limit Jul I love lists August
love lists etc etc it's kind of a bit
like a favorites video but instead of
being about all of my favorite products
and like beauty fashion products in the
month and said it's about things I've
done about things I've seen experiences
and things like that rather than just
products so you'll have a usual
favourites video with beauty and fashion
but you also have a loveless that I'll
be able to go through lots of different
other things that I was also living for
this month one thing it's glaringly
obvious I have gray hair you may have
seen it in my visa blog but I had my
hair dive and I mean it's less gray now
it's much more great when I was away on
holiday but the sea got to it a little
bit but I'm gonna put loads of purple
shampoo and it laid tonight in fact
right after this video I'm gonna go and
dust in purple shampoo for about 20
minutes and just pull it back to Y it
again I really really like it just to
get rid of the purple and try something
new
I was purple for three years three years
I had glitter so this is great so I
think to the back to the platinum and
the brief I'm just gonna get right into
it to Circe intro it's a ridiculously
long okay no one favorite thing to watch
this month has been orange is the new
black when I moved into this flats in
January we didn't have internet for two
months it was a nightmare and because of
that I didn't get to watch any Netflix
and then I kind of fell out of love with
watching Netflix and then the past month
or so I've really got back into it and
art is the new black
it's a thing that I needed to watch so
I've watched all of it now and I'm
really excited for the next season so
he's not seen orange is the new black is
definitely want to watch next up is my
favorite photograph of the past month
and seeing as this is the very first
time I'm doing a love list there was one
photograph especially I wanted to talk
about and I'll put that right here this
is a photograph of me and Alex obviously
as well as Julia from style and nylon
Erika from the edited and then Leon and
Karly as well and this is when we were
in Greece and we had an awesome
afternoon on this beautiful beach with
beautiful like silver gray cobble stones
all over the beach and it was really
kind of overcast day but just under this
really beautiful mood and we just kind
of hung out and we were playing
underwater underwater cameras and things
and we got this shot on this is one of
my favorite photographs played the last
year never mind at the last month if you
want to see more of these photos as well
I've just done a full blog post I'm in
the Frodo come my favorite person of the
month now this could be anyone I mean it
could be youtuber it could be an art if
it could be someone in your life they
absolutely love I think my favorite
person this month bearing a man had just
come back from Ibiza with five amazing
girls I would say every single one of
them because they're all incredible well
there's one girl who I absolutely love
we became really good friends recently
especially on the grief trip and she is
just really inspiring one of the most
sweet and warm-hearted people I've ever
met and I was absolutely adore her we
got on like a house on fire and that is
Carly Rowena if you don't already follow
Cal arena you definitely definitely
should she's just a beautiful person
inside and out and I'm just so so happy
that worth of such a good friends down
so I'll leave everyone's links down
below by the way that I speak about but
she's just yeah I have to in love her
next up is my favorite clothing piece of
the month and aside from this dungarees
skirt that I'm wearing that I just love
the other thing I definitely would have
to say is this dress and this is from a
brand called sailor
and I got this from revolve clothing and
I wore it recently in my I beat the vlog
and I just absolutely adore the colors
the colors and the sequins
there's something so sort of sexy but
demure and mature about this dress it's
fairly sure about I just think it's so
gorgeous front holiday so this is
definitely the thing I would say it's my
favorite piece to wear this month next
up is a favorite way I have spent my
time this month aside from being Wayne
officer being a beast from New York it
doesn't get much better than that but
otherwise things I've really been
enjoying recently are going around to
family and friends houses in London and
chilling with a bottle of wine in the
night it's been beautiful weather and
really warm and just sitting out and
chatting and gossiping Gavin about
everything that's been going on catching
up and just you know just being with
friends and just feeling so part of a
group and yeah I really really enjoyed
that it's been so nice to kind of relax
get away from the computer and the TV
and everything else and just to kind of
really distress so I've really really
enjoyed that this month my favorite
thing to eat this month has got to be I
probably say I've really been getting
into delivery the delivery app never
used it before
I heard loads people talking about it
it's like the load of the app and it'll
love it it is so easy just going through
see what you got to eat or doughnut it
comes within that half an hour what
whenever I order it does it's super
quick so there is a sort of Vietnamese
time place and quite nearby called to my
and they do an amazing chicken pad thai
so I've been pretty obsessed with that
my favorite drink this month has
definitely got to be trapper chinos I'm
not a coffee drinker and I'm really sure
when I get there
in fact I'm right or Carla Rowena how to
drink coffee because she too was like
the like office I tried Frappuccino and
now she's obsessed but I yeah I really
really like them especially I have an
espresso machine so I use that and I use
like a caramel espresso pod with fill it
with milk and it's a perfect drink
really I can't really drink coffee in it
like without the milk the milk really
helps to dilute but make it much more
creamy and I find it's such a nice drink
in the mall
before I start working or before I go to
bark or or just in the day it's like a
little better pick me up so if you're
someone that kind of wants a bit of
caffeine to kind of pick you up but you
don't like coffee
definitely track frappuccinos and also
castor do a beautiful long cold I think
it's like the coffee like a coffee
cooler creamy caramel coffee cooler and
since that and it's like a caramel
Frappuccino milkshake cooler and it's
delicious so good my favorite event next
month I think this is the first one I'm
doing I'm going to kind of roll it back
to July as well and I'd probably say one
of favorite things I did recently it was
I went to Paris with Victor Ralph and we
stayed in the peninsula hotel and went
for victory off party in central Paris
for their 10th anniversary and it was
incredible it was amazing to be part of
it and it was just a brilliant brilliant
little trip away and he was really
amazing actually so that would
definitely be high in my list as well as
the three weddings that I had around
this time for my mom my best mate Rachel
and my best mate Steph
they were incredible also but if it was
something outside of weddings I just
have to be Paris my favorite song of the
moment I have so many and if you follow
me on snapchat I often talk about my
favorite songs when I'm listening to my
favorite songs but I really say my
favorite song right now is the Selena
Gomez song good for you it's just so
kind of sexy and I don't know Simon
quite seductive and playful about that
song and I really really loved it and
it's something that I would never have
imagined Selena Gomez doing I thought
she was much more kind of poppy but
there's something kind of I don't know I
really like the sound it's got a really
cool vibe so I really really love that
song the moment desert jacket out and
last thing is my favorite thing to use
so that's good bit like a gadget or an
app or anything like that and I probably
say my favorite thing different it's
months has been snapchat so if you don't
follow me already
I'm snapchat in the fro I'm in the fro
everywhere so if you ever wondering is
she on this have a look for in the fro
beyond their months probably but I've
been loving it like when I was in high
beef that I've seen so many snaps and I
was almost vlogging it but by snapchat
so I'm truly is it much more and I'm
really getting into it like I'm
snapchatting most days now for the past
few weeks so I love that so definitely
go over there and try that and hopefully

loveless for August and a little bit of
July icing as at first bond let me know
