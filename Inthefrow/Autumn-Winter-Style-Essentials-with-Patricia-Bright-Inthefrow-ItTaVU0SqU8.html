the pleasure of being joined today by
Patricia Ella
hire her I've roped in Patricia to film
a five autumn style essentials feature
with me if any of you saw me the week on
the stand up to cancer stream I was on
there talking about similar things so I
thought I'd film it for anyone that
didn't see it and also see what Patricia
had as well in her closet and see what
we can bring together yes and I actually
neither like autumn as well I feel like
it's my favorite season yeah and like
there's so many nice things you can wear
to meet you look good so it's like yeah
perfect video we've got five different
style essentials each I'm gonna go
through each one one by one yeah and
hopefully inspire some of you so do you
want to go first
my first essential is an oversized
jacket for the altar time I'm one of
those people I always get really chilly
really cold so I have this parka jacket
right here and you know another part of
my favorites night style essentials as
well is like anything with like a fur
trim and I third trims on anything it
just looks so nice and then a park card
is just really warm and cozy and quilted
if you can get a park or an oversized
jacket definitely do it because it's
gonna keep me nice and cozy
yeah where is this one from this is from
very cold at UK and they've got really
really nice bits and you know I love the
color khaki and long fur trim and I love
a pockets like all my favourite
essentially yeah I hope that I thought
was really nice exactly right hopefully
it's almost like a wine purpose yeah
it's such a nice kind of isn't it I was
like if I cut this off and it just where
is it yeah so love that that's what that
looks like I'm nice and affordable if it
was it very as well I think this one was
quite affordable definitely good I'll
try and leave links by the way to
everything we talked about together okay
so okay what can I talk about knitwear
so what I'm wearing today I wore it to
Sukkoth show you and the next one I've
wanted a you've seen it everywhere I
love this yeah right the color is just
so imperfect you know I never would have
been able to wear this with purple hair
but with my white hair now
I really look good it's so cute I think
it's like a caramel q can't like the
caramel in it
but I think anything turtleneck for
autumn just goes with everything and
keep your neck warm it means you'd have
to wear a scarf and be a little bit too
over heart and I think it's really quite
a sophisticated style I think it's super
nice it's like the opposite of me would
like my boobs like anything kind of big
and chunky night knitwear you can't go
wrong so I'm going to do Beauty next and
I'm going to do lipsticks and for me
it's anything that's either move or
Brown and I love move and burn lipsticks
I like to blend them I like to wear them
on their own and these are actually two
colors from L'Oreal Paris and one of
these creditors could pull em in air
which is I can really dark like mo and
it works on all skin tones it's so it's
really nice that be gorgeous on you got
looks gorgeous on me and then also this
color called food food obsession it's
like the most amazing Brown and it kind
of looks a bit ugly like when you see it
like this but on it's like oh my gosh
this is fabulous
so yeah I love that I think that if you
can get go with the darker colors and
the warmer colors for autumn it just
looks so nice yeah especially with
knitwear like that like caramel knitwear
with a lovely bramlett is so nice
beautiful yeah okay next one gonna go in
accessories I'm gonna go for the suede
bag you know this one is Chloe so this
is more expensive if you like your
designer handbags and perfect if not
just I'm talking about suede bags in
general there is sewn out there where
they're tousled or quilted or just have
a flap that's suede and the rest is
leather so many different types you can
have a look for in fact on my blog
recently I did like a rundown of lo
different tight yeah and like
alternatives I'll leave the link down
below we can go and have a look at that
but I just think that is so wearable
with everything for the winter there's
something about the way that this one's
kind of warm and kind of Christmasy I
think
young and that back is just the most
gorgeous bag ever it's like it is a die
for you I know I'm but a Tsar I have one
that's quite similar
it's like laughs not similar but it's
like a suede Brown and they make furry
as well Oh kind of like texture like um
Pony Harris okay it's not like that but
it's a really nice alternative if you
can't get the curly one and then you
think yes so sorry
and also there are quite a lot of dupes
of this back as well again I'll leave
links down below or dresses look so for
me my next autumn essential is an
oversize dress I'm a dressy kind of doll
anyway just because of my body type and
I find that Jesse suit me more look at I
like like a long oversized one that
comes down to like MIDI length which is
what I'm wearing right now this is a
really long dress I love there I might
stand up a bit later on but it's got to
sit down the side and I can wear it like
by the hills or I can even want me like
flat trainers and look kind of cool and
for me I hate being cold so I don't go
for mini dresses in the autumn I'll go
for like something like there's
something knitted as well it's super
nice yeah you look gorgeous from and
totally suits it oh yeah thank you
enough that next thing from me would be
the over knee boost if you watched my
channel
last year you will have also seen that I
was then obsessed with over me boots but
I kind of feel at the back again every
season yeah yeah perfect swear I either
wear these over jeans if it's a really
cool day over jeans perfect otherwise
with kind of longer mini dress it's just
above your knees and then you've got
these you've got a tiny little slit in
between the knee and the boots I mean
the boot the dress and the boobs yeah I
just think it looks really quite classy
and sophisticated
keeps your legs warm and allows you to
still wear shortest dresses if you want
to so it's sexy as well that's what I
like like over the knee bit so sexy but
sophisticated at the same time yeah I
think so I mean these ones are from Kirk
Tiger and yeah you have the heel but
there are a lot of them out there that
have more of a chunky heel the dirt the
not pointed on the toe so these are more
of a sexy of boobs but you don't have to
go as sexy C's even if you want to go
over the knee Oh sex it
they after that so for me one of my
favorite colors I know you mentioned the
suede but mine's kaki
so I've already showed you the jacket
but I basically have coffee everything
anything that's like olivine eparchy I
just find it to be so warm and so
flattering you can just wear so much of
it in the winter this is a dress I wear
this dress all the time people are
always asking me about this dress it's
got a turtleneck as well okay and
there's like a midi dress as well it
just fits so well but there's something
about just the color copy that's just so
rich and so warm and if you don't know
we're all over we'll get you know kaki
bag or coffee jacket skirt there's so
many different bins and for me it just
looks good and actually everywhere
specially if you've got red hair so I'm
like this is the perfect color you know
look that I did it where's this one from
I says from what a house is this one
what is this for my house it should be
like it's so nice I love that yeah I
should drop it okay next thing for me
which is probably my favorite piece for
the autumn is the suede jacket this one
is from marsh because I was looking
everywhere and found this one was my
favorite but there are so many
alternatives on the high street you've
got Topshop River Island a sauce all
doing pretty much replicas or similar
spells somewhere tassels on with
fringing this one is just a kind of
generic zip or aviator style but the
suede is so gorgeous though so yeah just
one that's quite nice and fitted it's
got a few little details like the button
details and whatnot it just looks so
great for the autumn and you can layer
it with lots of different things
gorgeous but finally my next favorite
trend when it comes to autumn is
anything shearling so I'm totally into
texture and I love jackets with that
I've got like suede or faux suede and
like shearling on the inside so I hope
you guys can see this but it's like
shilling on the inside of this kind of
this is my curved throw which is from
remover island
hopefully hoping you're in screen it's
just a really really nice really wall
and if you're someone again who gets
chilly like me if you've got that extra
layer of war and of shelling on the
inside it makes so much difference and I
like just to see that extra flap of
detail you know the contrast looks super
cute yeah is this just kinda like an
older jacket yeah it's not going to come
off and I'll call it colonel
yes exactly lucky cake yeah that's cause
your eyes the same come with the belt as
well that's stunning
so it was a really nice KP brown cote
thingamabob okay I'm just gonna go buy
my new wardrobe is Patricia's wardrobe
yeah okay my last thing actually I'm
wearing my potatoes my next thing is a
pair of ankle boots and these ones I
have not taken off I'm pretty sure I've
mentioned Merida in a favorites probably
but these are from Reese again there's
those different jeeps in the ninth
Street this is what you want but I
always say a good ankle boot you cannot
go wrong with I just I've worn this with
jeans leather trousers jeggings skirts
mini dresses everything and they're just
so comfortable I think if you've got a
heel it's not too high you can kind of
get away with walking in it everywhere
are they comfortable like when you end
up well game good boy okay fine yeah I
adore these ones but a really lovely
suede I think especially like a lovely
black super black suede look so
sophisticated and slick yeah see and the
heel on that is just gorgeous it's like
a wood in here with the gold dito as
well I just think it's so cute so that's
my last awesome essential and it put
