doing so so well this video I have seen
on quite a few different channels I
think since I did this tomorrow did this
video losses this video and in nicely I
kind of put it off because when I was
thinking about what I would name is my
kind of worst products I did like the
most I've ever bought I kind of didn't
think of anything straight off the top
of my head I was like well I kind of
love everything that I have bought in
the past but actually when I got
thinking about it I was like these shoes
weren't as good this bag wasn't my
favorite and I realized that actually I
have been disappointed a little bit by
some products so I thought I'd put this
video together for you so I've got three
items I really loved in three items I
didn't like quite as much so thought
we'd just have a chat about them I'm
gonna start off with one of my best look
sure purchases and that would have to be
the Yvonne she added gonna in Navy which
I've talked about so much and yes it
really does need a clean I'm really
really sorry fact to have them use this
bag now for quite a few weeks maybe a
few months but it still sounds is like
one of my favorite bags and at the ball
and it might be because I bought this as
you probably all know I've mentioned
before I bought this in pink years ago
like three years ago
which obviously means that I really
really love this bag and it's still
going so strong this down the bag it is
just so cool the shape it holds so much
it's just one of the best bags I've ever
bought it's just when I was really easy
wearable bags I could wear with
absolutely anything and fit everything
into it without it being too heavy so
for that reason it's definitely kind of
a favorite and the fact that it's in the
textured leather means you can't really
scratch it or ruin it so this is a bag
of thing a poly half for the rest of my
life hand it down to my daughter if I
have a daughter like this one that's
really robust bags so this is definitely
kind of a safe so on the flipside of
that something I was a little bit more
disappointed in I guess would have to be
the use these are my Louboutin I think
they look a gal a pump now these are
like the 12 centimeter like the highest
Louboutin
and in our time not necessarily
disappointed and I'm not naming these as
a worse product I'm just kind of
mentioning them to bring them to your
attention these are like the most
uncomfortable shoes in the world like I
love heels I could walk for hours and
hours in heels like the don't bother me
these massively bothered me these are
the most uncomfortable things I've ever
put on my feet ever I bought them
because they just look absolutely
gorgeous and I still stand by that and I
do still wear them because they're just
absolutely stunning and they make a
massive statement but I can literally
wear these front hour and a half before
my feet just want to explode I want to
love these more but they're just so
uncomfortable so yeah if you're thinking
of buying some Louboutins please beware
they're extremely uncomfortable this is
certainly a worst product or robot but I
want to mention it so my next kind of
best product purchase I'm sure a lot of
you're probably waiting for this weight
have to be my Valentino Rock stuff so
looking a little bit beaten and bruised
now I'll be honest especially seeing as
I like throw them in my case now they're
still gorgeous
I still wear them to death and that's
reason I wanted to mention them because
these were perches I put off for years
because I thought they were kind of done
and they were overhyped
and I didn't think I really needed them
until I had them in my life and now I
feel like I need every single color ever
in every single shape and size unless it
is so comfortable if you're a heels
where you'll realize these are actually
really really comfortable I could walk
so long in these without feeling like
the hurt in my feet anywhere or let my
feet get too tired like my feet to still
get that tired of these because of the
ankle support the fat it can have
strapped on to your ankle I don't know
it just gives me more security and more
support and they're just so gorgeous in
this color especially this is the powder
color they will go with absolutely
everything that you own any color after
all powder will go with
I think these are very expensive shoot
about 1730 pounds but by far and wear
them rather than any other shoe socata /
where is minimum and I love them too
this and that too a more disappointing
product would have to be these actually
Prada boots on the outside look at them
like I'm still totally in love with
these boots like they're absolute
gorgeous like a matte smooth leather and
leather goes everywhere all the way down
the heel
it's got a cute little Prada similar
here it's got a zip up here and another
kind of boots that I in winter or my
autumn winter I wear these sorts of
boots about the going out of fashion I
love them to fit however I was a little
bit disappointed with these because the
quality just didn't really match my
expectations or the price of these boots
like these boots around 600 pounds and
the quality of this heel is shockingly
bad I think the first day I wore them
and I got home and all the leather here
on the heel was pushed up now that could
have been my fault maybe I walked onto
something it pushed it up probably
whilst but then I thought the price
should it have been that easy to ruin
well then pass that I send them back to
Italy they fix them I got them back I
then got them back and more than once
more for day and at the end of the day
realized that the stuff they steal bit
here have completely come out so now I
was walking on metal so everywhere I was
walking on my tile to fetch it just
looks really really bad it just makes
your shoes look like they're really bad
quality so again I took them back has
altered it Elaine got them back and
Barry mind takes about six weeks every
time you send them back to get fixed and
they always say to you never to really
send them to a boot maker and to send
them back to where you got them from
just so that you don't kind of like void
your policy and all that I kind of went
along with that okay something back to
Italy but then I got them back again and
again I wanted for one day and this has
happened again
that shouldn't happen to a 600-pound
pair of boobs I'm not walking anywhere
that where the ground is unusually hard
I'm just using them as a city boot the
way they should be used I went into them
in Prada and said these meant to be for
carpet only because otherwise this is
ridiculous so anyway this happened to
get so in awesome when it hit into my
own boot makers and Satan can you put a
more reinforced heel on because this
isn't working so yeah so that's the
reason why I say these are one the worst
pitch sticks that the brother purchase
that has brought me the most
disappointment and then back to the
positives a product I love to bits oh
I'm so glad I thought was my first
Chanel so I bought the Chanel walk the
wallet and chain bag I bought it in
Paris a couple of months back was about
four or five months ago now it's
actually so well use it really needs a
clean I'm really bad for cleaning our
bags I'm so sorry but it's so beautiful
and a lot of people have these wartime
chains because they are kind of a small
Chanel bag that's very easy to wear
they're a little bit less expensive than
like a boy bag only a little bit though
but honestly I'd say this is one of the
best purchases I've ever made because
I've worn this more than I ever thought
I ever would because of the color of it
and the style it goes with everything
again like I come up with black navy
white light blue
I mean I'd happily wear this in fact I
think I have worn it with this so many
times
and it does fit quite a bit in I mean it
fits my phone it'll fit a liquid
lipstick and mirror key my card because
inside it has a card area where you can
put all of your credit cards so they
don't have to become a falling around
your bag you can put any cash in here if
you want to inside the zip pocket but
quite often I like that to use for other
things like keys for example but it's
just very compact and I remember
thinking it is actually going to hold
anything in it but it does expand out at
the sides so you can kind of wear it
stretched out if you need to I mean I
think tomorrow whisper going oh my god
why stretching a Chanel bag but I mean
you've got to make use of the baggy just
pour and
that's kind of the way I use it I just
kind of expand it out put what I need in
it and honestly I can't tell you how
much I can use this if you are thinking
of buying this and you're worried that
it's a bit too small and you'll not use
it I guarantee you'll probably use this
as your most kind of date night club
night going out Kanak back especially as
well for like daytime and just when
you're nipping out the shops is so handy
so yeah this is one was that okay and
for my very final kind of disappointing
product this is really quite
controversial it's the Chloe fake Chloe
Fay Mini and I mean I still love this
bag I love aspect of it and there's so
much hype around these bags like they
were so hard to get hold of and when I
finally found it I was like oh my gosh I
finally got it and I was overjoyed
especially as it's a little bit less
expensive than the other Columbia bags
it just means it was a lot more people
wanting to get their hands on this the
only thing that makes me feel it was a
little bit disappointing it is
discoloration that it's kind of formed
over the Chloe sign and it's probably
where I probably used this area to open
the bag like that but I still feel that
I didn't touch it that much for it to do
that and yet I kind of feel like it's a
little bit discolored around here now
don't if you can really see it just
looks a little bit discolored and of
course this is tan suede totally my
fault I totally get it
I knew it we're going to happen but this
is still my video I'm talking about
disappointing products and for that
being fun I am disappointed that this
happens and it's probably sort of worn
away rubbed away but I just didn't
expect it to kind of look like this so
what I'm trying to say is if you're
thinking of buying a Fay I would maybe
think about going for one full leather
or going for the one in black so you
don't get any kind of discoloration on
it as I Talia is just a little bit more
sensitive definitely so that's why I
wanted to mention it just in case you're
thinking about this bag it's a gorgeous
little bag I do love it I just wish that
this hadn't really happened because it
kind of puts me off using it
but now cuz I feel it looks a little bit
more and that's it my three best and
three more disappointing products like I
don't want to be too negative and then
honestly there aren't any products I
ever thought I really wish I didn't have
that or I felt like I wanted to sell it
not yet anyway so it's kind of hard I
didn't say those three are the ones that
disappointed me so I really hope that
helped with anything that you're
thinking of buying soon hopefully did
let me know down in the comments what
you think let me know what your most
disappointing product is just so I don't
go and pick that up too as always thank
