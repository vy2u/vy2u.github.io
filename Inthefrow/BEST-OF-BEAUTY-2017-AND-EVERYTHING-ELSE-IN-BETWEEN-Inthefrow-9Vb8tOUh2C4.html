and happy 2018 this video is gonna be
all about everything that was awesome in
2017 so I thought you know I'll just do
a few things my absolute favorites but
then when I got looking I was like what
that was awesome that was awesome so
this is just turned into a full-blown
long video about everything I really
really did love last year but when it
came to choosing like absolute holy
grails
and if I was on a desert island how to
choose only one these are the ones that
I was like it's just about beat the
other one anyway I better go with it
it's gonna be hella long I'm gonna start
off with shampoos and conditioners first
one I have to say is the L'Oreal aviv lv
blow shampoo this is just my travel
savior or the thing I go to when I don't
want to over wash my hair so if I just
want a shampoo and condition it's super
quick give it an amazing clean cleanse
and feel like my hair is amazing
afterwards this is what I go to and I
also use this every time I go traveling
I literally throw this in and it's my
like shampoo conditioner in one this
deserved a royal shout out as one of the
best things that came out and that I
discovered last year but alongside that
I also always take with me a mask just
to complement it and usually I'll have
the red can click 'save magnetics mega
mask with me the blue one is more of a
protein based one which I love if my
hairs feeling super dry but this one is
the one that I use most of the time so
that I don't over kind of protein my
hair and on a Cyrus fan it's one of the
best things it really brought my hair
back to life this year and gave it all
the nourishment we needed with such a
nice bright blonde coloring so yeah
honestly amazing I love I love red
cancer hair stuff if you know me well
you also know that I love to use
different hair products as well so the
next thing someone's gonna get it's
gonna get comfy here the next thing has
to be mousses every time that I wash my
hair I use a mousse before I dry it and
then just scrape it through my roots
into the hair so the first thing to
mention would be the L'Oreal creme de
mousse it comes in so many different
variations and colors of strengths that
all brilliant this one is the one I use
quite often it's a strong cold one it
just gives ultra volume and then I
always dry my hair upside down it's
allows us to get to work as well the
volume but I don't drive my hair without
mousse I just love how it feels so have
either been using L'Oreal come to mousse
I realize it's that this is too but this
is the one I've been using for the last
maybe four months and also just really
really into pure algae clean volume
weightless moves maybe it's a little bit
lighter in the head and the L'Oreal but
maybe that's because this one's a strong
cold I mean they're both fantastic this
is a little bit more of a kind of luxury
this is also vegan hair product and then
you've got the kind of classic L'Oreal
product but both are starting my draw
side-by-side
I don't really prefer one over the other
I think they're both incredible I just
said something maybe a little bit
lighter and also for you and probably on
our favorite styling products is here
has to be the L'Oreal sleek it bear in
mind there are a couple of L'Oreal
proxxon here for transparency I am a
L'Oreal ambassador especially last year
was for hair but I mean this isn't a
sponsored video and this is just talking
about the products I've loved the most
and I guess because I used so many
L'Oreal ones I found some like super
gems and with one of those gems hacivat
the sleek it I use this a lot last year
especially if I was having straight hair
or if I was having like really slick
ponies get a little bit of this run it
through my hair sweep down any of those
little strays and it's just such a good
product I've never had anything like
this before and I honestly don't know
where I was before it it's so handy and
it works so well it doesn't weigh down
the hair so definitely my favorite
styling products of last year and going
to this year this product it's pretty
favorite blue from our last five years
it's go by the Moroccan oil
I don't dry my hair without putting oil
on the ends let us feel like my hair
feels really dry and I don't like it so
I'm rockin I'll it's my go-to and I've
used this probably nine eight nine years
now every time that I wash my hair a
little bit too far my hand run it
through dryer and my head it feels so
much nicer afterwards I know that this
gets mixed review some people say that
it's too much coating the hair and
actually nourishing it but it feels good
to me so I love it and the last hair one
would just be too old I mean I love my
Dyson hair dryer but if I had to choose
if I dried my hair or if I killed it I
would go for curling every time I've
loved curling my hands here and sort of
experiment to a different hair style so
the ghd's have got to be the one and
only
this one which is a large barrel or the
more conical wand barrel I'll link both
down below both remaining but this is
just the one I reached for just before
who put honestly I couldn't live without
killing my hair with them I think
they're just they're kind of like a stay
pulled us to have ready to kill your
hair fake town what am I wearing right
now you ask that would be this one the
Loreal sublime bronze overnight elixir
self-tan for nighttime the thing i love
about this is that its face and its body
so you can use it for both super honey
when you just want to do the whole of
you especially if you're away and you
can't brother taking two products want
to do faithful to do body and then you
mitt so this one honestly it's amazing
the one drawback on this is it is quite
biscuity you will have the smell of
biscuits even after you've showered and
scrubbed it still got slight smell
biscuits until your second wash that's
why i found but it doesn't bother me
because I actually love the way it makes
me look it stays popped for a good week
or more and just gives me a really
lovely bronzed whenever I've got this on
people will ask me about my tan
when I'm wearing this so it's got to be
one of my favorites but I know the smell
of town really bothers some people if
that's you then I highly recommend Peter
Liberata it's just one of my wanna know
leaves I've used it for years the
phenomenal fake tan mousse to three-week
tongue moves this is an medium I also go
for dark as well sometimes I mean I know
I'm super pale but I do like to
especially them going away on these
slight mouldy strips and away places and
I'm gonna mean a bikini I just want that
ultra kind of super tan but honestly
it's such a brilliant moves with Amit
you're not going to get streaks it's not
too overly smelly and it's just just a
really great time for body products for
me it's gotta be sanctuary all the way
sanctuary you can get active boots I
believe it's just boots I think it is
this is yeah it's just one of those
awesome brands that just stock loads of
different body and face care things and
they're just just just just what it says
in the tin in fact what's him on that
another one it's a sanctuary moisture
best facial wash this I have I've
probably been through about six of these
no walk back to back it's my favorite
thing after I've cleansed and taken off
a makeup this is my very last thing to
go on the face to wash everything off
before I Pat it dry and then it's kind
of done I just love how light this is
I love that doesn't make my face feel
dry it's just a great face wash
overall I'm just feel super clean after
I use it but before that for cleanses
I've got to say my favourites got to be
the pixie Caroline herons double cleanse
I love I'm literally out of this one now
pretty much I'm almost out the oil side
especially is the one I love just to get
in there and break down all the makeup
so you can swipe it all off then you can
use the tones and cream on either side
to really kind of get in and make him
feel super lovely and moisturized again
yeah it's just one of those great
products again I take this away with me
all the time because got two in one it's
super easy super handy and it's just not
overly offensive in terms of smell it
just does what it what it says on the
tin and I trust Caroline so much I know
that she would not bring out a product
that she did not believe in for things
like I makeup removers it's gotta be the
Garnier micellar waters this is the oil
infuse one if you love your waterproof
you cannot beat this if you like
waterproof mascara if you don't go for
water from Skerritt then the pink
version of this is amazing it's pretty
much all that I use I have been kind of
flitting between a few of those recently
because I've had a few gorgeous look she
wants to try some using them first but
an honesty to recommend I honestly don't
think you can beat the Garnier's they're
so good I'm so affordable like the use
now is that also flight three quid so
good
best face mask of the year has to be
this one the detox mask from L'Oreal
again it just makes my skin feel lovely
and clarified detox afterwards just
clean just really with now so it just
feels like it kind of pulls everything
out it just makes my face feel great so
it's the one that I kind of trust the
most this year I just don't think you
can go wrong with that product it was
two more for face while I'm on it keels
midnight recovery concentrate definitely
a shout out as my kind of late-night
overnight beauty product that I've
absolutely loved I just Pat this all
over before I moisturize that and I
really have felt like it's added so much
more radiance luminosity into my skin
and just really really helped it at the
moment I'm having a bit of a breakdown
my skin you might notice this huge bad
boy right here on my face which is just
broken up and it's very angry today so
maybe I need a bit more of this on
tonight nice for sure and the very very
very last beauty product to mention has
to be this one the body cream the boom
boom cream by Sol genera it just smells
the best
I'm not really one for caring about what
lotions I'm putting on as long to make
the film moisturize open this one but as
long as it smells amazing and this is
the one that smells the best fer me just
a few things can I mentioned general
things youtubers I absolutely love this
year and would high recommend obviously
I watch a lot and I love a lot I have a
lot of good friends who are youtubers
and that you guys know me well for being
friends with but just to kind of talk
about the people who I think you've
really kind of continued up in their
game this year and created some really
cool stuff and things that I've really
really been excited like super excited
to get watching so first one I'd say is
Sammy Maria which I'm sure you guys
already know she's a good friend of mine
I think she's amazing but I think the
main thing that I love about Sammy is
that she had a baby this year and
although obviously like becoming a
mother for the first time super hard
work she kept up with channels she can
also has her blog as well which it keeps
up with my amazingly she got married
this year but she goes about everything
in such a classy sophisticated way and
continues creating gorgeous content
that's really true to her and her
audience and I just love everything that
she does and she's super fashionable
such a great genuine girl and it's kind
of wish her on a success really another
person who I am just so in love with is
chriselle lim I've met Chris Elle a few
times and she's just as lovely in person
to such a girl blast huge inspiration to
me in terms of what I want to go and do
in the future and six kind of the
success she has is so inspiring she also
saw an who continues creating incredible
content for her blog as well as her
youtube channel which i think is very
very difficult to continue creating blog
content along video content not let them
kind of blow my own trumpet or anything
like that I know that I do both but I
want to say that it's very difficult to
do a bit of both and to do it well it I
kind of feel like some of these bloggers
and youtubers don't get the kind of
praise that they deserve for the amount
of time it takes to do both and to kind
of upkeep in them microcell does it in
quite impeccably she also has a little
girl and just yet just manages
everything with such classic grace and
beauty and she's just such an
inspiration I think she's amazing
another channel I absolutely adore this
year was the Philip DeFranco channel he
is awesome he is like my YouTube news
guru everything that happens on YouTube
or in the world that's kind of a huge
deal or off note that
people kind of in my audience range
would be really interested to hear about
he calls it in a really kind of an
excited to digest way gives you all the
points in an unbiased way I know loads
of other people a friends of mine who
also love him I think he's just
brilliant and he's literally as soon as
he uploads a video I'm straight on it
especially when I'm at the gym because
he does like 15-minute news stories and
I'm just there on the cross train and
just loving a bit of his news and I
think he's amazing
oh and then obviously Megan elevate as
well she has worked so hard again
this year I'm really opening a game on a
YouTube channel she's always been
incredible bloggers that I followed and
she's a good friend I think she's just
amazing and also a Manchester gal there
are not as many youtubers in Manchester
as there are in London so it's a so nice
to see more northerners - extremely
extremely well and get they praise they
deserve a distinct she's awesome her
content super cool she's got an awesome
style she really puts the roll in and
again she's also a blogger and continues
creating incredible work on her blog -
another step praise where it's June I
think she's amazing so those guys are
definitely my recommendations for 2017
also seeing as I do so much travel I
thought I'd need to kind of mention at
least one place that I'd recommend the
very most everywhere I went last year I
did I think about 26 trips last year so
there's a lot of good contenders here a
lot I would probably say the resort that
blew me away the most was probably the
shangri-la resort in the Maldives there
are a lot of amazing maldis resorts
really are well that shangri-la was just
perfection it was beautiful absolutely
amazing and definitely a massive
highlight at 2017 for me so I would
definitely feel looking from all these
trip if you get married going on a
honeymoon and then TV shows okay so
couple this year that I want to mention
what did he see that fish sons of
anarchy
if not you have to our solicitor Nicky
Charlie Hunnam is like my number one man
I love him so much is just absolutely
impeccable
I said impeccable few times this video
that might be my new word my new word
for 2018 yeah it's just an incredible
show you've got to see it things that
come out this year though Manhunter or
some Oh Ozark also so awesome very
highly recommended I'm also kind of
going off of things that kind of came
out this year that a bit newer
yeah those the two that kind of stand
out if not I'll leave a few more link
down below cuz I know I'll think of some
soon as I turn off the camera when it
comes to fashion I'm gonna do that just
have to make up a few fashion bits it's
gonna be mainly based around brands
because we're gonna be so many things I
love this year so instead what I'm going
to do is choose my favourite brands I
really feel like killed it and then show
you a few pieces I've got or maybe like
my favourite piece from that round so I
don't go to head over heels here we
don't want to be here all day let's get
into the maple this thing unless it's
not makeup but it's technically in that
arena perfume this is gonna be my
favorite there are a lot of favorites
there would be a lot of contenders are
all like here and this is just so worn
that if I had literally thought as
Island had to choose one thing to smell
like for the rest of my life which one
would it be and it would be this one
Rouge malachite yeah I've also got the
people on Suzu from Armani as well
absolutely gorgeous but I'll be honest
it's hard to get hold off because it's
so popular it's very hard to get hold
off you can get all of it amazing good
on you you will love it if not then I
just don't think that Rouge malachite
gets the shout out that it needs because
it's just insane honestly like I just I
can't get enough of this perfume it's
gaudy nice ok let's start off with
skincare for makeup shall we I think you
pull you're expecting this but it's got
to be something to do with lemare the
renewal oil first of all one of the best
things that I've ever found my skin I
have it on now underneath my makeup I
also have some on the tops of my
cheekbones this is just radiance in a
little beautiful part but I often will
do is I'll Pat it in before moisturizer
or I'll mix it in with moisturizer one
second
oh and therefore the moisturizer I need
to mention is the lemare soft cream the
hard cream the normal moisturising cream
I do not like it's too hard it's too
thick does not work for my skin the soft
cream is so voluptuous that's not the
word sumptuous
so nice and I love mix these two
together hell yeah they're the price it
they are like megabucks skin care
products but I think that as soon as you
kind of get on the hype you'll
understand how wonderful they
and how beautiful they make your skin
feel and it I know so many women who
will invest just in skincare mainly who
don't really care about shoes and bags
and everything else they'll just go for
their amazing skincare cuz it makes them
feel incredible and you know I guess
that's what these brands are kind of
made for trying to remain calm there are
enough people outside playing with a
baton ball very loudly I'm like shall I
continue
shall I are you gonna go away right
let's just continue I'm very sorry if
you can't if you can still hear that
yeah next thing's gotta be Foundation
and my goodness do I have a ridiculous
Foundation drawer I have so many things
I love but this is all about using that
one and only so for me it's gotta be
this one bare minerals bare Pro it's one
of the things that I have worn the
absolute most in fact I don't descent
how I still have oh it's a new one why
this is incredible
medium coverage almost meted too high
buildable coverage it's a wonderful skin
tone for me I am number twelve in this
it's warming well it's also not being to
oranjee it covers everything it leaves a
gorgeous base I can't fault it I think
it's incredible I also think it's
amazing this is sky thing that I could
wear for every single event and for that
that makes it the foundation of choice I
really wanted to mention cushion
foundation but I'm not going to want to
move on one concealer to choose it's
going to be nice creamy concealer this
is in Canal it's the main thing it's
honestly just the best thing ever
I've packed it on top of this spot I
can't tell you how good it is in
comparison to how this looked before I
don't go out the house without one of
these in my purse and I dug out the
house I apply this on my face first
either
it's hella good it's so good I'm gonna
do lip products cuz that's what I'm most
excited about talking about next
lip balms first up Willam a lip balm has
to be my chosen one this time it's the
smell it's like very subtle peppermint
smell it's the way it makes my lips feel
it has her almost bit of a mattifying
effect to the lips when you apply it I
cannot talk more highly about a lip balm
and about this one but they just release
this as well in pit it was like a pink
tone and it's barely that pink it's
literally the slightest mouth pink but
it just is exact same products a little
bit not pink thing good in 2018 it's
gonna be all about this one
I hope this isn't limited edition when
I'm very upset us case this tiny little
knob that's left the rimmel cappuccino
liner it's my one and only it's
incredible it's just that very natural
shadow lock to the lips that goes any
any color any color you can wear this
with dab it in blend it in a little bit
with your finger then apply your
lipstick and it just makes your lips
look insane can't say any more about how
but that is I'm very sorry but I have
three contenders here for lipsticks
because they all do different things
y'all do very different things the thing
I'm wearing right now which is probably
my absolute holy grail number one
lipstick you know what it is Tom Ford
Alexander number 82 bear in mind there
are two different Alexander lipsticks
from Tom Ford two very confusing this
one is number 82 and it's a very light
nude one thing although on it's like a
baby bubble pink so slightly confusing
and in future I'll always make sure I
say 82 now this is just the most perfect
nude look you've ever seen but with so
much coverage to it to like it doesn't
just wishy-washy nude it's so beautiful
with this luminous so I'm just looking
in the mirror here
luminous satin it's not really shiny
it's off like it radiates right Oh
so that's my favorite if you can't find
that one then I also recently bought
spiced honey which is almost the same
it's so similar and also gorgeous and
that's larger that's the thing I like
about this is that it's a mini one it's
a lips and voice mini one so just go
tuna lips so no I don't go out the house
without it let's just say that now to
other contenders if you like your matte
liquid lips you cannot do any better
than the bare minerals I don't think
this is the gen nude bare minerals and
this is in the shade slay there are a
couple of colors alike I also love
smooch but slaves probably like the wand
this smells like vanilla buttercream
it's just wonderful and it's just got
the loveliest moosie creamy texture but
leaves your lips matte without being
overly dry it's fantastic
and my very last choice has to be the
Armani lip magnet and especially in the
shade 508 okay the camera just died and
still so much away from the apps
but I'm going to continue with what I
was saying before I got cut off yeah the
thing I love this about this is that
it's got this doe foot applicator with
this perfect point seeing it right into
the Cupid's bow the finish of this it's
almost something in between a stain and
a lipstick it really kind of stains the
lips with the color without feeling like
you even have anything on the lips oh so
it looks like you're wearing lipstick
but doesn't feel like it and it's more
than a stain does that make any sense
oh I love is consistently it's just
beautiful color it's comfortable it's
not sticky it's not like heavy on the
lips I don't think it's a revolution in
lipsticks so I had to mention it mascara
options were also a very very difficult
choice and after a little bit of thought
it's definitely got to be this one the
George Armani eccentric Oh mascara like
I said a few contenders for this but I
think the thing about this is that I
know what I'm gonna get from it I know I
can take this anywhere with me and it's
gonna give me like gorgeous lashes it's
really black it's like super jet black
it coats every single lash its
lengthening it's thickening is
volumizing I mean you don't get that
ultra crazy like spider eye effect that
you get from maybe the Dior pump and
volume which was another contender with
this one it's just yeah gorgeous yeah
highly recommend two highlights of note
this one from Charlotte Tilbury I am
pretty much out of now the beauty light
wand it's just absolutely gorgeous you
just Pat it onto the skin it looks like
your skin but with most ultra glow it's
stunning I've had so many compliments
wearing this and then I often quite like
to pack powder over the top or my second
favorite which is the RMS Luminizer
which again I've got on today and it's
just one that's all around the products
that you can just apply and apply and
apply and it just makes the most
incredible glow wherever you apply it I
just think it's just incredible just to
have on you and have around old times
it's gonna apply more because why not
honestly and this one is in the
champagne color by the way this is
something I will buy lots and lots and
lots of safely said to me tomorrow I'm
really sorry but we're actually gonna
can discontinue this I would definitely
buy ten let's just say that the same
with this one it's incredible it's the
most gorgeous creamy highlight and again
you just dab dab dab tap it in it's
foolproof it's so easy to use and
it's just absolutely amazing I honestly
think it's like the one the best
products this year well sure I think one
of the favorite blushes I got actually
was this one from Estee Lauder this what
I think was a limited edition this
summer looked palette when it has yeah
doesn't even say what call that blush is
but it's just gorgeous for oranjee
terracotta I always say it's too hot
it's not it's almost like a rose meets a
coral blush and it's just the most
beautiful palette I just really love
this shade so much if they still do it
honestly I'd highly recommend you get
this but I don't think you can get it
anymore but it might always be worth
going asking Estee Lauder like what was
that blush and what's it's similar to
because I'm sure they have something
similar I think it's absolutely
beautiful but if not my favorite for the
past maybe three years has been a
Charlotte Tilbury first love blush I
think it's one of the most amazing blush
colors for me ever and the textures
gorgeous on it currently say mom not
about a blush for contour it's all about
the Tom Ford shade and illuminate think
this might be my third one now that I've
gone through I've got it in intensity
one it's just what the best cream
contour I have tried I wear every single
day ray not sure how you and the
consistency and everything is this
beautiful on it I love the tone I love
the shade I love the texture I love the
way what it does to my skin and I also
love to add it as an eyeshadow as well
so for me it's like a jewel product I
really wear now how often I'm saying
it's amazing so I'm gonna stop that
because otherwise yeah this is because
we're ridiculous favorite brow product
has to be a Tom Ford fiber brow gel
I discovered this earlier this year
started using other things and then
rediscovered it again about a month or
so ago and realize just how amazing it
actually is it's got little fibers
inside of it so that when you apply it
on my brow so it not only applies really
good amount of product to coat the brows
it also brushes them and adds fiber so
we thicken up - this is kind of thing
that I could absolutely wear alone
without using any powders to fill and it
just gives you an incredible natural
bushy brow look that's amazing don't say
it for powder and fit I don't often wear
too much powder but the one that I did
keep going back to because it's so
beautiful its Victoria Beckham powder
looks a bit dirty now because I dip it
and blah blah and it's just great it's
just a really great transparent
mattifying powder without being really
that mattifying at all it's kind of
really
folks at the product makes everything
lovely impact on without being cakey or
drying or taking away any luminosity
it's just a really gorgeous product and
great to kind of have any person look so
pretty but I mean the products inside is
good it's not just about the packaging
by the way oh my god nearly there nearly
there now when it came to eyes shadows
again it's a lot of things I use on my
eyes for eyeshadows but I had to kind of
think about what I'd recommend the most
and for me it got a visitor so Eva
pallets every time that I get new so Eva
palette the shades are always different
but the textures and the pigment and the
consistency it's always incredible and I
don't think that so either get the
height that they deserve
I mean I've always said that I really
wish it had a mirror but a lot of people
disagreed with me and were like well it
means that they can keep it cheaper and
I'll just use my bathroom mirror which
is fine but quite often for me when I'm
on the go I do quite like to use mirror
but at the same time it's nice it keeps
the price a bit lower so these such a
great affordable price for so many
eyeshadows the pigmentation is really
beautiful on them super saturated colors
the shimmers especially just gorgeous on
a foot things arrived or some of the
best eyeshadow brands out there and also
just think that massively overlocked I
think they're incredible remaining shut
up shut up but I think most people if
you hopefully give a shout out to modern
Renee salts or similar from uh Nastasia
Beverly Hills I actually did really like
the subculture palette what is it the
green one I did how she really liked
that the shades in it but these are
absolutely gorgeous shades too and I
have used this palette a lot I must say
but if it comes to like shadows that I
would want with me onto the island I'd
probably go for zoeva bronzer so sorry
but this was actually intuition I'm
really sorry but it has you know it was
my favorite the Lumiere bronzer this
year just for the color and the payoff
of this is amazing literally just use a
little dab or else you will be Barnes
like super bronzed and I also love
applying this as an eyeshadow so for me
if I can get like a duo purpose product
out something I love it even more I'm
sure little a man must do another
bronzer very similar I least I hope so
because I'm gonna be so good in the mist
from South I think it's amazing yeah
honestly it was my favorite bronzer so
I'm sorry if it wasn't edition but I
have to include it and photos for face
brace Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray was my water no late and always
has been I think that's it for makeup
products oh my gosh Fanta
stick right let's just talk a little
about fashion as well just to finish off
this video and I'm going to mention five
brands that for me can of where my
brands of 2017 mostly you guys might be
able to count against what these might
be but I've included kind of a few
different ranges in here but these would
definitely brands I absolutely loved the
absolute most for 2017 and yeah just
think a lot of really these brands very
me very much my style and I feel like I
really I just wore them a lot so you
guys might know me for wearing new
France let's kick it off first of all
with Dadar Ted Baker look how beautiful
this is okay so much you might know me
as being someone who always has to make
suitcases because I've had the past four
four generations of terrific suitcases
I've loved it I love how lightweight
they are whilst they're kind of a hard
case while still being somewhat soft if
that makes any sense I know it's like
it's a hard plastic case but it's not
anything compared to the steel metal
cases you can get or super hard thick
plastic ones something about these allow
them it's a little bit more blood you
can remove them a little bit more you
can push them together a bit better yeah
I just feel like it's a little bit more
room for maneuver with these cases and
they're also quite light so you're not
gonna have to worry too much about
having super heavy steel case it looks
awesome like the remoter ones look
amazing it's so heavy you can barely put
anything in there because they're so
heavy so Ted Baker is or what I'm all
about
I'm so proud last year to be a part of
their campaign that was a face of Ted
Baker last you which is insane it's an
incredible achievement that not many
bloggers have actually had the chance to
do part for maybe a few us brothers but
I just felt so proud that Ted Baker the
huge established brand wanted to have me
as a model in their campaign I'm still
like blown away by it and I love that
team yeah but but now I just have so
many gorgeous things from Ted Baker that
I just absolutely adore means the peach
shoes are one of their like classic
shoes are absolutely beautiful very
Manolo vibes but even more extra and if
anything the quality is just as good if
not better
I mean I wear a lot too big have got a
lot of their clothing and I just adore
them so for me that was definitely one
of my top brands it's going to be on our
top run around for 2017 I mean if you
saw that NASA shoot that was all Ted
Baker clothing
it's just an absolute dream to be just a
baker for that the next one I want to
talk about gives me an M which is where
this blazer is from Ian M is kind of
like an independent very cool but I saw
upcoming although I feel like this
pretty established now but I guess in
the scheme of things not so many people
know about me and M as they should do I
think that's gonna change definitely
over the next few years they're kind of
my style down to a tee that's lot of
tailoring that's a lot of roll necks
there's a lot of tunic style clothing
gorgeous fabrics of Kashmir's its walls
the silks it's very much everything that
I love like if I was to make my own
clothing brand me and M would be a huge
inspiration to me it's very much what I
would make myself that's why I adore it
and they've just brought out this
gorgeous blazer with the matching Prince
of Wales check trousers looks really
cool red I don't if you saw Instagram I
wearing this recently about absolutely
fall in love with that a little bit this
is more oversized but super cool though
you might also see me a few times
wearing these really cool quite cropped
but chunky jumpers I've got it in black
and I've got it in gray and I've worn it
today I absolutely love it the quality
the fabrics the way it looks the way it
sits the silhouette it's just absolute
gorgeous
so me am I think it's going to be a
brand to keep hearing about I think this
next year I think they're incredible
another brand who I'm a huge advocate
for as you may know is Strasburg I think
they're gonna have some incredible
things coming up this year the fact the
mega marker wore one of their beautiful
totes recently just I'm so pleased
because I feel like it's really kind of
helping put them on the map they're a
wonderful team of people they are so
creative and innovative and cool it
would have gorgeous new ideas they just
have a beautiful product
that's an incredible quality like
literally this rivals of quality of my
designer bag collection but much more
accessible price point for a lot of
people and again I think it's one of
those brands that it's just going to go
from strength to strength to strength
this year in the next few years if it
already has it's growing huge it's grown
so huge listen it's I first discovered
it like five years ago but for me this
is one of my brands for 2017 without a
doubt another brand that I absolutely
adores got to be Reese as well I wore a
hell of a lot of recessed year one of
the things being this pea coat that
recently came back in stock I'll leave a
link down below if just in case there
are any last pieces left
it went into sale I'm came back in stock
but I've lost so many things from race
this year I have the most incredible
white suit that I got from Reese I've
got a couple of different pairs of shoes
I adore they do beautiful tailoring
again it's very kind of me kind of brown
so that's why I like it this top is from
Reese actually they do some of the best
leather leggings out there leather
trousers if you like leather trousers
but it's their kind of coats and jackets
collection as always as well that really
can't have hit the spot so again a huge
huge brand loss for them 2017 and when
it comes to designer luxury brands who
was it gonna be if you know me well
you'll know the answer this straight
away it's gonna be do you do your is
that brand for me that if I could wear
one runs the rest of my life and I could
choose any and it was possible a little
bit you're it's just something so
beautiful and whimsical magical about
the deal brand for me there's so many
people out there that I know that a big
Chanel fans and they would always choose
a Chanel bag over any other but for me
it's do it so let's do shoes do your
bags do your accessories I just have
something about that brand for me that
I've always loved ever since I was
younger and I found out about the brand
history of the brand and what came first
and everything that kind of went on
through the history of the brand up
until now I haven't like a real affinity
with it with that brand I think now yes
so I've invested a lot into do I I must
admit that bags their shoes especially I
mean these shoes and I have worn so much
and they're still one of my absolute
favorite shoes they're probably my top
like three favorite shoes at all time so
again last year for me was very much
about deal I went on filmy trips with
them they're incredible team they're
really kind of welcoming with open arms
both the fashion and the beauty team so
it kind of became one of sight the Dior
girls for the UK which is insane and
just a complete dream come true for me
so that was like a massive highlight for
me for 2017 yes oh I've got to say those
the five Browns sort of firebrand this
fashion brands that I think were like
the bomb for 2017 have I missed anything
out here I've taught Beauty I've taught
fashion I've talked lifestyle II bits
