curly hair routine this has been the
most requested video for the past like
month also I've been doing this hair in
numerous Instagram so like this one this
one this one especially its basically
been the same process and same routine
every single time so so many of you
especially on one of my latest videos
I think 95% of the comments were pretty
much please can you do a hair routine we
want to know what you're doing to your
hair so thank you so much being so
complimentary and especially with this
whole new center parting thing I've got
going on this is all done to you guys
being so super nice on recent video so
thank you all so much
I'm really trying this out and I'm
really really enjoying it so it's about
time that I put this video together for
you I'm gonna let you in on a secret as
well with this video I film this whole
thing and realize that my camera has
switched the settings on the audio it
didn't have any audio if you're
wondering why I'm talking in the cutaway
that is why so let's get into the hair
starting right from the very beginning
I've literally just washed my hair with
the new L'Oreal LV fiber ology air race
is brand new to l'oreal paris to serve
volumizing thickening sort of range so
if you've got quite thin hair quite fine
hair you'll find it's really quite
thickening especially volumizing it
gives really great root lift it really
makes your hair feel so much thicker for
me I have somewhere in-between thin and
thick hair it's kind of in between
somewhere so this works really really
well for me it definitely makes my hair
feel thicker without weighing it down it
feels really really lightweight it also
smells gorgeous or
that also L'Oreal Paris says this is an
T flat for up to 48 hours and the really
cool thing about this product is that
the conditioner is the very first
L'Oreal Paris crystal-clear conditioner
so this blew my mind it's almost like a
clear gel rather than a thick creamy
opaque conditioner as you'd use again so
I've never seen anything like this is
the first time the L'Oreal Paris is done
this she's pretty cool okay so after
washing I move in to adding some more
kind of volumizing products just because
that's what I like to use so first thing
I use will see L'Oreal LV extraordinary
oil this I just poked about four pumps
of this into my hand work it into the
very ends of my hair I find if I stop
doing that my head has lapped up but
just coats all of the ends overall to
drying my hair just feels so much
lighter and softer and smoother
so this massively helps the condition of
my hair I literally can't wash my hair
and dry my hair without using oils on
the end it's a must and it's even more
volume I mean I do like the volume for
real l met creme de mousse which is part
of their new race if also this brought
out this is just the one I really likes
its volume and stronghold it gives me
extreme volume and it also kind of holds
up for you for quite a few days so I
really really like this so I just pump
about a tennis ball sized amount into my
hands I usually flip my hair over and
I'm kind of roughly ruffle it off
through the roots into the little links
as well but most is the roots because
that's where you want to get that
ultimate root lift
there's flip over my hair upside down
and it's really roughly dry it with a
really fast powered high heat hairdryer
I don't use a brush because I find it
kind of flattens my hair so I like this
really roughly dry it through with my
hands kind of really rough little plus
with drying it upside down
you'll get ultimate volume and it will
really help all of those sort of root
lifting products to really get to work
when I dry my hair I've got great root
lift my hair is quite
captured is still lightweight and still
feels quite thick so really love the
texture this especially from using the
fiber ology err final work really really
well on my hair so ever since I've had
my hair that's Center parting and got a
bit more kind of texture to look going
on I've been a little bit obsessed with
dry shampoos so this is the one from the
fibre ology err range the root lifting
dry shampoo which smells gorgeous it
works really really well actually it
doesn't make your hair feel clumpy it's
really lightweight so I've been using
dry shampoos just to add a little more
grit into the parting give almost a bit
of a texture spray kind of feel to my
hair and especially if it's like second
day hair it also then helps making hair
look less greasy or you know just makes
it much more manageable so I've
generally just been spraying this
straight into the middle of my parting
down center then using it underneath my
hair into each side and it just gives
you that much more textured before you
must feel so yeah this is massive part
of my routine now like a year or so ago
I would never use dry shampoos but I
don't know since having it in this style
it's kind of been my go-to and just
before curling as well I'll also use a
heat tip hot and curl heat spray as well
it spread all the way through my hair
just make sure I've got some heat
protection and this helps will kept
holding the curls as well so big winner
so moving into curling and my favorite
kind of thing my favorite clients for
this would be a large barrel some people
like to straighteners I just really like
the large bowel this is like a 1.5 inch
barrel and all I literally do to get
this style it's going to be the easiest
hair tutorial ever seen this I literally
take it straight down the center and
part it into two sides then I'll just
take one side spin it round and tighten
one just to get it out of the way I
start right in the back
take a nice smallish not too small but
not too thick just whatever you feel
it's a good amount onto the wand so I'm
working on the right hand side with my
right hand and the wand is in the
opposite hand
so the wand goes behind the hair and
literally I just wrap it around I use my
hands to make sure that the hair stays
straight on the natural barrel I'll just
wrap it all the way around twist the
barrel further into the hair and I'll
hold it there for maybe 10 15 seconds it
depends how good your barrel is if your
barrel is really really good and really
hot then you can pull it release it a
little earlier and now I throw it back
just behind my hair this works out the
way so I can start on the next piece of
hair I literally do that all the way
around taking section then the next
section all the way until I get to the
very front section of my hair and when
you're at the front and you've got a
little bit of hair left there again I'll
take the one in my left hand hair in the
right I got the one you're really really
close into the root of the hair and I'll
wrap the hair round once move the barrel
really close into the root just to give
that ultimate heat and then I'll pull it
away and just wrap it again
and I'll let it go and that just make
sure that that front piece of hair is
twisted the right way around and also
gives you a bit of root lift at the root
as well and just do the exact same
routine so moving from the back forwards
just in almost in stripes along with
your head again when it gets a very
front piece and take the one behind as
close to the root as possible to see you
get loads of heat there
and then let it go so at this point when
the hair is looking extremely pristine
and a little scary delicious
take your hands and rough it through
your hair to use your hands as a hair
brush and just brush through all the
pieces of your hair and it will just
break up all the pieces and seems much
more softer lovely wave so I'm just
going to use a Loreal Elnett hairspray
this is the one with extra caring argan
oil that's always nice special bleached
hair and I like to almost hold the curls
and squish them up just a little bit
more texture a little bit of spray the
front hold that in place and that is it
big big hair so I really hope that
helped guys hopefully you learn

been doing and I've been sort of putting
