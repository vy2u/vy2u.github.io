the past few days actually we got back
from Mexico after that awesome awesome
trip I don't mean listen can actually
even vlog was going back and we we got
back anyway on the Monday and then we
had to go very quickly back to Wigan so
we got her on repacked went back out to
Wigan for my granddaughter's funeral was
yesterday so they don't vlog any of
yesterday either
we've been away so if now Wednesday and
something horrific is just happened now
I'm sure I've seen at my news spread
felt our I wonder last night I was in
bed or sky and wondered what all the
noise is about so many sirens all the
way through tiny I'm so jet-lagged and
it was super light what is going on
outside I'm so noisy look at this
morning Emma texted me citizen okay over
there like I said what fire realize it's
literally right opposite our our balcony
it's absolutely shocking
quickly show you it's terrific it's just
here
kind of actually but it looks like looks
like a lot the fires gone out now that's
still smoking so badly still putting the
fire out it keeps the middle of it
actually keeps coming on fire again
yeah um I don't think Nick fire engine
red the climbing has to get up higher
higher yeah so I'm so horrible to wake
up to again the just devastating story
so many people lost their lives in their
hours it's just so sad
alright ok so I've just em do some
outside to get my cab which has to get
awful all along this street fire engines
are lined up and this Billy any traffic
getting in and out and the sort of that
is there is my piled up I can't believe
it's absolutely shocking and just an old
fire engines outside and all the
ambulance service and please
we potentially think of moving we love
this flat and we're thinking of saying
but we're also thinking potentially
moving so I'm just going to quickly go
look at some class today I really don't
have any time for it I don't want to
deal with this stress right now
what these things happen sometimes when
you live in rented places back again in
the same position this area we've been
out and I've done a few flat viewings
now what you said we are definitely
going to move just due to some issues
with our logs so we're going to move
back now going to get working on a new
blog post that lvl lash lift blog posts
after now I've just not had any time to
do it yet and now it's going to be a
monster average last post it's about 40
images in this blog post so if you're
someone who's interested in how the lvl
treatment works and each stage and
logically happens you might want to see
this blog post because it's going to be
so in-depth oh I'll show you what this
looks like right now I'm just going to
got everything laid out so far sore
enough to pictures look so sleepy yeah
you look a bit more away but I feel like
a bit odd it's so funny when you see
your face like really straight on god
lows and those maslov's those those
those are the pictures in here so I'm
going to write that now so I was linked
to this now half 10 finish that blog
post I am going to go and put some
channel now but now the shower and
really exfoliate really good exfoliate
oh god I'm gonna barely talk though I
think I don't know how to do that I
think I've like snap something in my
brace and it's like it feels like a
piece of wire is sticking out and when I
talk it slightly to the side my tongue
is cooked a bit right now so our books
emergency appointment event an emergency
appointment at the dentist for 8:30 a.m.
fine 8:30 appointment I've got 9:30
meeting and now I've got ya
dentist lunch get my nails done after
that and I've got another thing after
that I seem to film another video at
some point so I know I did I went no
idea what I'm going to do that
good morning guys so lovely fresh air
links ton 207 Dylan's engine done and
it's now half past 7 so you to leave any
tonight why is everything always so
last-minute in my life maybe to the
dentist I'm at half an hour early
at least Silicon Valley talks is so
digging in her so it is a little bit
wary Matson she'll need to have like
classical music playing in there when
you all that's why I'm really behind her
I have them lingual braces which are
like train tracks on the back of your
teeth so that's why I'm coming going six
today I will leave all the information
out below if you are also interested but
look how big you're almost there this
only little happy one I focus on
absolutely beautiful a London let's go
get some turmeric way to the homeotic
town quickly think and then back home
lots and lots of work at the new nail
look out we knew our music a delight
people go for ma when I'm home and Mac
on my favorite spot on the sofa and it's
in such a beautiful day today I'm doing
so nice uplifting weather but I
literally just got back a dentist then I
had a meeting then I had another meeting
with clinic which was hilarious
so which one then I had my nails done
look how love this colors it looks quite
light hair on camera but it's actually
quite a lovely pink tone I think it's
CND one pink passion or something but as
always get my nails and dry by my
favorite salon ever I'll leave links
down below it's always kind of fear that
it looks very mysterious with sharks is
this slight shadow going through so very
toned fact I am very talkative today so
I did that and then I went and did like
a talk presentation which was cool and
then I came home so it's been like a
full full day from like 8 a.m. on words
and but very very exciting news we have
put an offer in on a flat it's bigger
than this current flat where hey and
it's going similar price so I'm just so
happy we found it got a lovely landlady
and the cool thing about this new flat
is that it's kind of like actual room so
like the lounge is a room and you can
shut all the doors it doesn't sound like
much but when you've lived in that your
studio flats that have that kitchen
dining room lounge so long it's kind of
nice to have that separated room thing
again be nice for me not like candles
lit on the couch in front of the TV if
you like you can swimming certainly
catching for the TV watching films or
candles wet but I under a throws and you
know there's something quite romantic
about it don't wanna move here it's just
a bit of a stress off my mind in fact
that we've got that now tell me Lisa
which means moving vlogs it means home
we're home this going to be our last
well hopefully our last rented place
ever since I was 18 when I moved out
I've had like a different flat per year
so 8 9 flaps apart now I'm so sick of
moving and swimmin half my old house
