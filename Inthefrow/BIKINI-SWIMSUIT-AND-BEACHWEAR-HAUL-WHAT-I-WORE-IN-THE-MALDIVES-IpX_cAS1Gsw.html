be like a swimwear beach wear holiday
we're sort of whole collective sort of
whole I've been on a couple of beach
trips recently and picked up a lot of
amazing swimwear that I really really
wanted to share you may have seen a lot
of it in the vlogs but I thought I could
show you in a little bit more detail
just things like the features of each of
the bikini swimsuits the beach where the
prints the styles and yeah just kind of
make this into more of a whole video so
without further ado I'll get into it's
quite a few little bits to show you the
first thing I wanted to mention is this
swimsuit you may have seen these
swimsuits around all over Instagram
they're literally everywhere you'll
recognize it by this very cool very over
embellished like feathery leaf detail
down the sides or some of them I have
them all the way around the bust off
somehow them over both shoulders some
are extremely flamboyant this one just
has it over one shoulder like this very
low back the front just kind of cut
quite low as well it's very very
flattering
another thing I do really love about
it's well ice it's almost a bit of a
song bomb and I'm really into this more
kind of bikini song style bomb so if
you're kind of really into that the
moment then you may lack a lot of these
bikinis because I have scoured the web
just find bikinis that a lot more
flattering on the bomb not that I have
the most amazing but ever but I feel
more amazing when I wear that sort of
swimsuit so I wear the sort of larger
bottom swimsuit satisfy I don't feel as
flattered so that's why I really really
love this it's this from a brand called
layer of ish yeah Larry this of course
all links will be down below for
everything that I've shown you I'm gonna
go through all the bikinis first and
then go on to beach wear okay next up I
did not take this off in the Maldives
and a lot of you asked where this was
from so it is this cute little what
would you call this like balcony balcony
kind of bikini top so comfortable really
really flattering if you've got bigger
boobs than me it'd probably like really
push them or permit them look super sexy
for me it just kind of covers really
nicely don't fit I want to fall out a
net but it's still really flattering and
in this you can get loads of different
types of bottoms to match it so these
ones I went for which have the more of a
thong bomb and it has the ruching down
the middle so they're super flattering
on the honestly looks so lovely
but you can also get these that don't
have the tie sides and it's just more of
a Brazilian side it's a thicker strap
around each side this also comes in a
band down style I think there's loads of
it so I can mix and match that they can
get this is the style I went for and
absolutely loved it and I've seen it
quite a few other girls wearing this
exact set as well on Instagram so I
think it's a bit of a hit and I'm pretty
sure is set together was like 20 quid or
something and it's one of my favourite
bikinis of the whole trip and now the
bikini that you guys seem to love I need
to wash this yeah a few of these pieces
are waiting to be washed I was about to
put them in I was like no no we need to
film this video it's this you may have
seen this on some of the sunset pictures
we've talked and the underwater pictures
I am obsessed with this it fits so
nicely this new bar in the front it's
just a very flattering
lovely band of style and this comes with
the matching bottoms now these are quite
a large bottom but I didn't mind I just
really love the style anyway a comments
a lovely set so I love those a lot
another set in that same colorway now
this has tan on it so it's like it looks
like the Flex of town on it
unfortunately well this is an absolutely
amazing for kini I'm obsessed with the
color of this in fact yeah what is it
got it looks like it's like foundation
I'll turn all over this so annoying I
get it off in the wash so this is the
top really flattering the way it pulls
in because of the way it's got these
this section in the middle means that
you kind of quite nicely supported and
pulled in a little bit I love the strap
detail I mean the way it Criss crosses
across the back it's very flattering
super cute I love pastel colors or my
bikinis like this one I've got another
one in a minute to show you and I'm a
little bit obsessed of them I just think
when you've got Tam skin and especially
with blonde hair
I mean clad brunette hair as well what
would tan skin and a passable bikini it
just looks so summery and I just really
really like it so yes so this is the
other bikini to see little gold details
and the crisscross straps makes it real
luxurious and beautiful and again it can
it's a bit of ruching down the middle
here in the back it's not super song
line it's got a little bit more shape to
it's a little larger but it's not too
huge so big fan of that as well
the award for the most brightly coloured
piece of swimwear
goes to this go home this was brand-new
for this trip and I was just like this
color of yellow is just too epic I need
to try it cool thing about this is it's
kind of got these its built-in if you
can see that but it's kind of got this
built-in it's not wired but it's just
like a piece of fabric that kind of
helps to kind of keep your boobs in this
area lovely low back the ruching society
is gorgeous it's a really great material
beautiful color I mean even the enjoyed
wearing it from the same brand is this
one and again so blue it's that
incredible royal blue shade ruching this
time through the center a great V cutout
down the very middle but I didn't feel
at all like how it's gonna fall out and
I a smaller boobs I think you got bigger
boobs again you wouldn't feel like gonna
fall out at all because it you just it
would be much more covering on you and
it also has these like built-in pads on
each side which are cool the only issue
is not really an issue but the only
issue is that you just have to make sure
that when you tie it that the pads are
over your boobs are not in another I
know the position or else it does
doesn't work but overall such a gorgeous
piece of swimwear and again just cuz I
mention it on all of them it's a little
bit of a wider bomb but it didn't really
bother me okay I think this bikini is
the most flattering on me of all of them
and I think it's for a few reasons the
color like I've seen before about the
pastel blue on this pastel peach I think
is my absolute favorite color when it
comes like there are tops bikini tops I
just love this color it's just so
feminine and cute I love it so this just
fits beautifully again with this little
section the middle it pulls you in I
mean I don't have massive boobs at all
they don't ever like push together
perfectly but it did I definitely feel
more supported and a little bit more
flattered in my cleavage it's just
beautiful I love this and again the
bottoms are just lovely and small
nothing too teeny-weeny I fit still feel
covered but they just look really really
flattering on I want to get this bikini
again in this color just so I've got it
back up and they also do it in white so
I'm going to splurge and buy some more
just so I've got them then we do have a
white bikini and this one in fact yeah
do get to wear this one this one's kind
of cool and it goes around the
go around the back on this and then it
pulls across your boobs the leg here's
like this and then ties up around the
back this it's got quite a cool
crisscross detail I know I got a lot of
messages when I wore this on my insta
stories people asking where it's from so
I knew I had to mention it it just looks
really gorgeous I think I think a white
bikini on any trip is just like an
essential even if you go for like the
mix-and-match one I'll get one it's
super inexpensive but I think that white
just looks gorgeous not so much when you
get tan all over it or when you put it
in the wash afterwards and it goes
yellowy I mean this one actually has
stayed perfect and this has just been
through a wash so that's good but yeah
lovely bright white against tan skin you
cannot beat oh sorry I forgot to mention
these are the bottoms got a split side
and quite a nice size bomb nothing to
lose if also nothing too teeny and this
this swimsuit actually wasn't new but I
had it in my collection and I recently
cleared out so many bikinis I must have
cleared out like a good 30 bikinis out
of my collection and I tried everything
on and I tried this on again
and was like this is so amazing and it
has like a thong bomb sounds like I love
it getting a little bit obsessed seem at
times I've said the word Fung and bum in
this this thing I'm so sorry I love the
colors of this it comes in lower
different types of colors as well you've
seen these swim pieces everywhere but I
slide on it my collection I don't know
worn it well that's enough I need to
wear this again it just looks so so nice
so I felt really lovely wearing this and
I mean the quality of these is just
amazing as well so I'm just gonna
quickly check my Instagram just to see
if I've definitely come in every single
bikini yes yes yes yes yes yeah thank
you yeah I mean there's one other bikini
that I did wear on my last trip that was
a gorgeous deep but like navy blue when
it had like split shoulders but I think
I showed that in the vlog I'll put a
picture of it here for you as well that
is also a massive favorite and again
it's so flattering to wear on the bottom
the bottoms but otherwise I think it's
not a bikini right let's move into a few
other things one thing to mention that I
love and it was good it was great for
this trip especially was a pair of
things to sleep in and this is what I
took to sleeping in the Maldives and I
did show it actually once in the vlog
but don't if I mention it it's just this
little sleep sir it's a camisole with
this stripe pink to the top and same
little shirts but they're really comfy
they're a lovely lovely ripped cotton
the super soft yes really really
comfortable these are just from me nem
the gorgeous set big big fan of that I
took that to the Maldives and I'll also
be wearing that for summer loved it
okay now I just got four piece of beach
wear to show you now this has just come
out of the wash so it's a little bit
okay very very very creased this is such
a beautiful romper first of all the
quality of this fabric is beautiful it's
almost like a cotton linen oh it's rayon
100% rayon
it's so soft I just love the detail it's
colorful but not too over-the-top not
too intrusive the way it fits it's just
so beautiful
I just think it's just one of those
rompers that anybody could wear you
could wear it over bikini and it's not
to showing that you could also just wear
this without a bikini under it as well
but I have to mention it because I wore
it on the trip and I'm gonna be keeping
this for future trips as well a jumpsuit
that you may have seen again in my
Instagram's this is so pretty it is
BAM Dao it's stretchy elastic ated it's
beautiful cause of blue and little
specks of yellow and it goes sound these
lovely big wide legs almost a bit
Palazzo style but it's just so carefree
it's just easy to throw on any night
when you don't really want to make too
much effort you can just throw this on
no shoes or stilettos would really dress
this up a little bit even sandals a
gorgeous pair of like tan sandals would
just look really really pretty with this
it's just one that's like very
hassle-free pieces that you can throw on
but look like you really made an effort
without making any effort if that makes
sense
and again it's gorgeous gorgeous fabric
beautifully almost was a bit silky now
this dress you may have seen this in the
sunset shot that we got that sunset was
unreal absolutely insane we race
across to that area too so we could get
that shot and we were so bad with it and
I was so glad I was wearing this dress
clips perfect for the tones and the sky
it just looks so pretty this is just one
of those if you're going on any kind of
summer holiday and you want that kind of
super fancy dress that makes you feel
amazing a real statement call a dress
this is absolutely beautiful so much
detail going on beautiful fabric it's a
self elope t yes it creases a little bit
though so bear that in mind for your
suitcase but otherwise I just think it's
just absolutely beautiful if you're like
tanned and dark skinned you would look
insane in this dress
it does also come with a waist belt as
well just to cinch it in a little bit
but the quality of this is absolutely
beautiful this little number I bought
just before I went as well as like a
last minute thing this is literally just
from River Island but it's a black
jumpsuit a little bit of embroidery
across the front very low V now this is
if I'd had bigger boobs I would have
felt more comfortable because it would
have pushed out a little bit whereas I
felt it wasn't showing me but I kept
checking a minute just just in case but
same type that really lovely in this it
goes down into a full jumpsuit in these
big wide legs like this but they also
splits little wide legs split down each
side so it almost gives the impression
that you got this sort of flowy and
lightweight flowy dress when you wear it
which I could really quite liked yeah
this is a really really lovely piece
I'll leave a picture on the screen of
how this looks on the model but I
thought for the price it's just a very
pretty piece and again I'll probably be
taking this to India and then pulling
one of my favourite pieces that I wore
whilst this don't sue I'm all about the
jumpsuits and I'm on holiday because
they're just so hassle-free so easy to
wear this jumpsuit is absolutely
beautiful it's such a gorgeous silky
fabric don't know if it is silk is it
let me just check 100% silk
it just feels up so beautiful the
pattern is stunning I like the fact that
it goes down the back with these cheese
still it's just two straps down to an
elasticated waist line and you can
change the length of the straps as well
if you want them a little bit shorter or
longer and again they go down to lovely
floaty panting too wide legs just very
very flattering I just
lovely wearing this jumpsuit I don't
like us falling outfit I just felt very
flattered and this very feminine and
pretty well also the darker colors just
just keep it quite classy and stylish so
