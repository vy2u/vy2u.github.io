a bit cleaning up in editing doing some
bits and bulbs and I'm just packing at
the moment for the ski trip oh by the
way this is what my tan looks like okay
so if you were wondering okay look I
look you from our town in this light
this is not good lighting all set okay
that's that's better I didn't do my face
though so you can see that difference
because I always put makeup on my face
anyway like darker foundations so it's
all good but yeah in terms of my body
and the color I think it looks pretty
good that's one quite pleased that
that's that was the yeah Bondi sans
liquid gold
I just been packing and yeah so I've got
all of my rock the gear and they're all
of my sweaty better get got my hair
crazy and I'm going to travel in this
jacket this is sweaty Betty again it
goes with all those are the pieces that
got let's see if I can put your fan you
can see yes yes I love all of that
beanie on sections on it so that
turquoise orange and then hopefully is
this hood thanks so nice so I'm going to
travel in this just so it didn't have
like I don't have to have two massive
jackets in the bags I've got this one
which I'm Polly gonna use more apres ski
Kenneth afterwards connections just to
throw on and then I'll use my Roxy
jacket on the actual slopes these are
just stellar sportswear that's all my
rubbish should have been this is just
still sportswear pants I'm a little
Calvin top comes chillin today doing
some work we've got no food in either we
never have food in you you know Alex
made me lovely frappe hair though I just
have lots to do today so much to do do
lots of blog posts I want to get loads
of reviews done as I've got some peas
from Charlotte Tilbury I've got
neela rat I've got the hourglass I've
got these in sterling pieces from Galan
the baby globe this looks absolutely
beautiful this primer lipsticks mascaras
so that's stunning
also the brand-new maestro glow from
Armani I cannot wait to try that that
looks gorgeous and also let me show you
this because this is just insane this is
it looks is more shershow Armani palette
which opens up this is literally like
Christmas gift affection so these are
the colors in there can you see those
properly that's better
stunning so there's ten eyeshadows there
this opens out into almost looks like a
contour bronzer kind of shade and a
powder and they are brushes I think
there's two other sponges just one just
a big mirror and I've also got some
other bits from Burberry schnauzer boat
hills from Tom Ford and so much of our
shoot that I want to do and like a full
face makeup
oh and deal as well if you don't know
already I also block so I am primarily I
guess a fashion and beauty blogger and
if you know my blog and a lot of my
youtube videos as well you'll know that
I do feature a lot more high-end luxury
pieces and just because that's sort of
what I do now Mick mainly I really like
being kind of a luxury beauty and
fashion blogger so if you love high-end
makeup or you like buying like the odd
little piece go along to my blog and
have a look up fully I reviewed it or
talked about that particular product
that you may be after only if you want
some inspiration for new products go
over there yeah so that's why I've got
so many luxury pieces here like all of
these are luxury apart from a few bits
so go up to the blog it's just in the
fro comm have a little peek at that also
how gorgeous is this gleam got us all
little notebooks from smashing for the
Christmas party and myiasis Wunderlist
on it which I thought was so perfect for
me everyone else had different things
written on them because I feel like they
really put effort into thinking what
everyone like so wonder loss is perfect
for me and the blue matches my native
arms you have that very cleverly very
clever just trying on this new pair of
Hudson Jean
really love the color actually there's
almost faded effect on it and I'm like
these bits here they're quite cool I've
just spent the last hour so getting
ready and I've just still miss it's a
makeup tutorial as well hopefully if it
