to Alex on my channel okay so as you
know y'all you might not know alex is my
boyfriend we live together this is our
room things I do so may a Sethe hold I
thought it'd be kind of cool to see what
I like to choose if he was left
unattended to look obvious off website
with your car yes so I gave you my card
details and I said okay you go buy
things that you think I like and then
I'll just do my usual a fall see where
we get so how many pieces you got no
maybe like seven right something like
that oh really
I've never ever usually go shopping to
you though they never even know for
presents nothing you've never bought me
clothes I would never buy your clothes
yeah cuz I just know it get returned he
does he does buy me things for quite
often other things after I really love
this yeah you pick it out
I like it so I'm just gonna randomly I'm
really excited
don't be rough okay oh okay so this is a
dress oh my god it looks really
self-portrait oh so you're into this
calendar quite a sauce as well oh my
gosh this would have been so good for my
like dupes video my look should look for
max good to go so it's like Navy it goes
down to a little skin I mean I don't
usually wear skirts like this so
finishing to try this do you know I
don't wear skirts and this gonna shape
that much they usually a little bit more
come to Lipton or for them sometimes or
a bit more straighter but this is Richie
really nice yeah okay hello buddy I get
welcome Merry Christmas
and I don't the links will be down below
for everything anyway except to show
what the prices up okay so let's try
this on yeah so this is really nice it
is very soft quality with the way it's
kind of cut with the cut legs really
cute and I think for anyone that's been
cut self-portrait what's a little bit
more of an affordable option this is a
really really good one I have so many
dresses like this now I know I don't
usually get as many in this shape it's
more kind of almost eight a little bit a
line also of a skater skirt feel no idea
so I think it's really nice I think this
would suit a lot of people and I think
for me through a more flattering shape
so I figure thank first about what do
you think it's a nice dress yeah I think
it's a brilliant dressed with a gorgeous
dress
I just think on me the vampires have fun
short sleeves maybe a bit more kind of
tucked I think it really a choice oh
cool really really nice okay so all
right I'm gonna go something a little
bit different I thought this is kind of
cool okay but most things I think is
cool you don't like oh this looks nice
they tried to buy like a lot of a soft
kind of stuff as well some of it's not
all a sauce hood
yeah I love it on it that's really nice
not say so soon I think so yeah how nice
is this
good yeah you like up yeah who is that
something you'd actually keep yeah yeah
yeah I keep it definite just anyone so
Alex yeah yeah I love this it's kind of
thing I think I've wearing like
Christmas Day Christmas is that the
mostly like Boxing Day when we go over
to the pub when we have drinks with
friends it'd be super cute and like
Christmassy other Christmas jumper yet
no I don't I think I've got like a funny
wall that might say in the fro for nine
years and come in it but this is like
really nice it's not too thick and
over-the-top it's kind of like a lovely
lake where I would like longer by being
jackets and then you can take them off
when you get into like a pool ball like
and far and you're not going to hockey
still analyzing the cookie so it's
actually really lovely this is such a
good choice all of the colors the
clothes going well of my hair all right
this one's a little different
okay
oh yeah tell me what I need to some
Jawas this is kind of like the word okay
for can't share boy yeah oh but it's
good it's cute I really like that really
yeah really love that yeah it's got a
little little parrot wearing a top hat
and a little little walking stick as
well I think we took see yeah
George you really really like that
really I wouldn't I don't think I've
ever seen you wear anything like this
shirt
no I probably like chambray yeah yeah
you very very creams and whites and
stuff you know what though this looks so
nice with a sweater vest over it yeah
and I saw incredible sort of Esther's
same deal it would look perfect with it
I like it
do you like it yeah I'm actually doing a
lot better than I thought all right I
bought one pair of shoes so okay this I
love I have bought so many shirts over
here haven't been the right quality or
the right thickness or a right fit and
this caused by the way my mirror for
this is just in the viewfinder of the
camera can I cut with my mirror so I'm
kinda looking here what the fit of it
feels so nice what do you think I think
it's really cool it's nice isn't it
notice that though it was one thing we
picking it I had no idea what the hell
is gonna look like on yeah and I never
actually really see wear shirts so
really I'm a so many shitty find like
white little blouses and stuff boys this
is like a yeah a proper chef yeah and I
think as well in the next few months
with a cute running grey or white or
even a black like I said sweater vest
but also just to do your part of this
with the little collar space now it
looks so nice and it could tuck it in as
well it mean I slipped into the skirt
mouth Alaska it was advertised off took
them was it but just write that up like
I'm just going to press Q inside wear it
out like this with a cool pair of boots
I love them I'm definitely keeping it on
that last jumper I love them baby
really love that okay
just feel like Christmas day and you
just like oh this is for you Oh trances
oh well I think these are some grease
these are great oh they are really my
bitrate I think they might been the most
expensive thing of all these are
gorgeous
oh yeah about these because I wonder if
Victor's looking 23 2000 that gorgeous
Navy these are the kind of extras yes
they are gorgeous are you kind of wear
them with like heels and stuff - I love
them yeah coach Joyce is here gosh
so these are so many you picks so well
here these I absolutely love them your
brush it like fit really nice around my
palm got pocket feels well shape of them
it's a so flattering and they're not too
long use on the legs it's like a pair of
heels I kind of wear it and wear it with
this shirt tucked in for meetings and it
would be sociable at work out there
thanks for watching for today that's all
the she's like Washington to set to
look nice I think it was really good
yeah don't like a strong independent
woman you think you did yeah I kind of
feel like you're like quite empowered
right there's no see yeah Maxim deals
yeah these two together
I love yeah like you can see them out
together looks so cool really love Dex
really junkie some human both of these
but again this is my favorite I've got a
spider's web I do you have like they
have a sweater retro look I'm you're
actually loving this show I'm like the
leaves behind it consider you born like
I think you've got something similar
recently sounds like

they are over-the-hill today berry sauce
okay they are really great
I'm going to cut with it they are in
sauce base awesome oh my gosh they're so
great okay okay so the boot these are
actually really great choice yeah yeah
and there's so many of these kind of
boots on the market so many look like
top tacky and fashioning these are so
wearable we've got like platform and a
big block heel we feel really lovely as
well somewhere yeah I really could bring
they're not too tight but then the dope
free light them all down with a fabric
is what what do you think nothing the
cool
I mean it's harder to see them on other
jeans because it's got the black legs
here as well I mean this is one way that
a lot people wear them but all the way I
just wear them with a short skirt tucked
in with my beautiful me and these
are really nice do you like them I
really like these picture thing so final
outfit so this is an outfit oh this is
analysis no okay so I didn't actually
pick this this is like a an outfit that
came to parts okay on the model okay and
I was like
nine oh nice
so beautiful like all that lakes and
stuff she can't like so for trait I'm
upset

on the dress and see how much shape fits
me but everything's really good they

bra wrong so you can see my bra that's
why I thought probably wear a little
white cami under it as well I mean is it
