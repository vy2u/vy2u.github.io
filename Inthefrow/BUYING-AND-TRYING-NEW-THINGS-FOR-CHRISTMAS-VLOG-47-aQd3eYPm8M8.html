simple but elegant and then this
bracelet is absolutely amazing look at
how many shiny things these offices of
my favorites
you know me myself huh and this store is
so gorgeous
we're gonna go back a little bit or
chun-yin jeremy stickles I'm I'm very
very early in my book I think she's very
tenacious like entire these measures
which I mean a lot of people can be
quite a scary trade but in her I think
because she's also utterly charming
everyone pulls the her on once textview
well so she is my idol an incredible
moving averages the read already
searching for me and I'm back home
already back onto emails it's 12 o'clock
noon to get a shower and getting bad I
really want to take out these hair
extensions because there's some of them
are falling out all those are grips in
some house of God I've been wearing my
beautiful new moniker vanity jewelry so
let me show you quickly what I got from
the store when I wear this bracelet
absolutely gorgeous with this gray stone
and they're all syllabus everything I've
got is silver because I own him anywhere
syllabus the quality is just exquisite
on this to match that I went with this
ring which is just completely flat like
this and then goes around the back but I
thought it could look kind of cool with
the sort of flat shape flat shape and
then on this side I've gone for more of
the sort of round shape so this bracelet
again it's in the silver shade
absolutely beautiful it's just
incredible quality just feels amazing
and I love how bright the silver is it's
that really lovely bright silver and to
go with that I got this ring which is
beautiful and it has he sort of
encrusted tiny little diamonds around
the section and I think everything's in
that ceiling silver so it should stay
really really nicely and it's just it's
not a perfect circle and the ring isn't
perfect it's meant to be a little bit
unusual and more organic I've had a few
Monica van into pieces in there in the
past but as with most jewelry it kind of
buy new things and you kind of put
things away and you don't wear them as
much so it's nice to kind of food back
into owning some pieces that I'm really
really excited about so I think you're
gonna be seeing a lot of faith pieces
