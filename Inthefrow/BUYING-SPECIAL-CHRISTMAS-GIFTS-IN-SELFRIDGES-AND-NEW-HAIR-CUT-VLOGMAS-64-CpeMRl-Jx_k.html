and then yeah the beads as well I'll
show you I was inspired but if this one
here was inspired by this one so I'm
getting some like friendship names on
them that we have for each other I'll be
so nice and then I saw this one and I
really want this pile of DNA on it so
you know I'm going to come down gorgeous
and you can choose that if I call in
metals

idea

second Italian amazing inhale pretty
Italian food

win
chopping continues wrinkles good ol
Eminem get him
lots of family things vouchers and all
that kind of jazz baby baby clothes and
now I'm too jumpy when it's looking like
going along each so like what do we need
for 20 taken absolutely hey guys so back
at the house now it's 10 o'clock at
night could really be getting my makeup
off and getting in bed but um quickly
check in we got so tired we did
Selfridges we did Marks and Spencers and
we did John Lewis for lots of different
types of presents and things by the end
of it my feet were absolutely killing me
I mean I love those boots but after I
mean I've been on them like seven hours
so my feet tight enough and just got a
cab home you know I went to waitress
first got cap home and then I just made
some yummy broccoli soup and we got some
fresh bread to go with it and I bought a
bottle of Port feeling very festive put
a little bit more red no no I want to be
also
Selfridges gave me this beautiful little
scarf as a gift it's an antisera scarf I
don't know why I put it in my hair but
I'm used to always have I used to have
cropped hair so imagine this was my hair
like this but without this without this
born of hair here at the back I loved it
so I used to wear my hair up like this
in fact I was wearing a headband just
like this with short hair on the night
that mean I first got together this
little fact for you
and my you sort of anyway I just put
like this because that's about to check
off a makeup anyway I thought I'd let
you in on let you know about a little
purchase I made today I know I have so
much Tom Ford but and I have too many
lipsticks thought I had if out should
dispense from last year my brother got
me about your last year for Selfridges
and I've not spent it all year I've kept
forgetting so today I actually took it
with me and what I was gonna go and get
is my absolute favorite
Alexander lipstick which office that's
that's the end of a lipstick now my
absolute favorite lipstick as you guys
know however I went to us for it the
lady told me this is being discontinued
my favorite shade is being discontinued
oh my god
so i swatched at the back row hander and
i went round the rest of the tongue for
lipsticks to find one that could
potentially rival this lipstick and I
found this one full size looks like
side-by-side look kind of similar I'm
really hoping the finish is gonna be the
same because I'm just so in love with
this lipstick Alexander better be good
this is 57 spiced honey in the dust in
the lip color so I'm gonna put some on
now and let's see what we think yeah
that looks very similar I think John I
shouldn't I should have put half here
and half there shouldn't hide us a jack
but no I'm happy with that I am happy
test over test over I am pretty happy
with that
so I'll be honest though I am still
gonna potentially buy the last remaining
Alexander's offer feel unique just in
case why do we always go so crazy about
lipsticks is it just me or is anyone
else that's crazy
but when it's your lip shade well it's
your lip color that you spent so long
trying to find the perfect shade very
upsetting when they take it away from
you the very upsetting guys it's now
Saturday really wanna be in bed all day
today how it being Saturday but I am
going to get my head and I'm really
excited about it it's the first time

I'm gonna sit on my ass drink bourbon
while I cook my work oh okay listening
to thank killers
I have been chillin next to the super
watt rejecteth nothin so nice I'm gonna
meet my banana bread
I think excited about it I figured
seeing as I'm making the big feel better
better but feeling first achieve pastry
pie later that's gonna take up a lot of
time so currently on a wine bottle right
now I figured if I do the banana bread
now that at least I've got a little bit
of time in between to not be cooking but
baking today but if you go to in the fro
I'm gonna leave a link down below if you
ever go to in the fro to talking banana
I come up with my healthy banana bread
recipe so this is what I made the other
week if you watch much combo video and
it's so delicious and it's so easy and
it's pretty healthy the only thing it's
got in it it's eggs so yeah I'm gonna
make this and I will show you what it's
looking like
during I like to put our engine my
banana bread
rather than lemon well you can use the
lemon but it just tastes really nice and
especially around this time of year
orange is nice and Christmasy oh it's so
easy should I read recipe it tastes so
good this is what I have so far let's
pick a bit soupy mess bananas and orange
sir coconut oil nutmeg cinnamon and
bicarb of soda
I think this smells so great on the
camera does look like it burnt it but
it's just like be like a delicious
caramelized like topping it smells so
amazing
okay banana bread done next up is the
feeling
first she's best high it's quite an easy
recipe when you do it as many times the
main thing it takes the longest it's
like it in the pastry all flattened down
and putting all the ingredients on it
and make it super tasty in like perfect
so you can start making the pie and as
soon as got that done actually putting
ingredients together it doesn't take
actually that long but here we've got
eight eggs I've got a packets better
I've got a bit more of the lemons it's
like wonderful lemon at uni just shaver
gonna put the spinach into here and
that's jump and then I'm going to roast
off some pine nuts which like my upon my
absolute favorite things in the world to
eat roast em off throw that in to mix it
up so sealer all that laying out in the
sheets so I've got some grease proof
paper down that I've just so just like
put loads of coconut oil on the heat so
I can use my little little thing and
have hot coconut I'll see otherwise it's
like hot and unusable and I've just got
a packet of filo and just gonna lay it
out she like lay out one sheet landscape
and then you lay out another sheet
slightly above it that fills your grease
proof paper and I'll take away some when
you've got like a little sheet later
I'll just go back over with some idle
you know when Jamie Oliver does this he
does it with some flour all I think I'll
make a rapeseed oil book I mean about
that line right it's a little bit of
pepper over top well how knowing like
remember last time I made this and it
have any cayenne pepper then either so
I'm gonna have to do mine with paprika
today never mind
China still arrives that's not put like
and then themselves unless you face what
yeah so then you lay out its filo again
the top of that and then you do the
whole process again with the pepper oil
right let me give it a little in the
middle and double-check this defo done
when I was in Chicago it took so much
longer to cook
I made it bigger so this is Jeff loonies
yeah guys I still look this hideous
today I need to get into formal I felt
however I did change my jumper all
because Amelia came over yeah I like to
treat my guess right yeah cuz I just
made the banana bread didn't know I
thought it was a perfect time for me
