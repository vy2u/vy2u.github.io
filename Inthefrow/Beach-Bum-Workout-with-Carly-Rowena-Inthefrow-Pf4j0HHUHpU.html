beautiful sunny green I am with the most
beautiful lady I love her I'm sure you
must know of Carly already but if not
I'll leave all the feelings M below go
and have a look at her channel and
subscribe
kylie is a fitness blogger and also a
personal trainer so she really knows her
stuff when it comes to fitness and
looking your best and feeling healthy I
mean the best part of you and you did
you be my angel because we're here in
Greece and we're with discover Greece
and also Olympus cameras we're swimming
in our Olympus just today we thought
we'd film a video all about beach bum
workouts they also film with lean
machines which is also Carly's and Leah
and we did a bit of work out there and
so many of you loved it so I thought
we'd do a little bit more in depth about
the beach book we're gonna go through
five different exercises that you can do
at home if we go on holiday on the beach
in your hotel room
anywhere else you want to just to try
and get that perfect Beach and you need
nothing but your bum yes so the first
thing gonna get you guys to do is we're
gonna do some standing ab exercises so
I'm sure most of you have all done squat
now when you do squats the first thing
you want to think about is actually
thinking about the muscle you're using
so most of us do the movement and we
forget so for example if you can do a
bicep curl people can do this all day
long
the easiest thing in the world but if
you squeeze that muscle it's 10 times
harder and you should shake and that's
what I need to do with your bum if
you're doing the exercise that is
freezing it we're not really doing that
exercise so think of the bum squeeze it
as hard as you can generally as you're
coming back up and that will make things
10 times harder so if you're sport you
want to have your feet hip-width apart
for some of you you may find you haven't
goes very good ankle flexion abilities
if you want to get something underneath
your heels so you're slightly elevated
maybe not actual heels but just
something you can stand on that will
make it so you can go lower because you
really want to kind of go to the point
where you would be stitching so for some
of you as well if you want to do with
the chair behind you so you are
literally touching your bum slightly to
the ground or to the state
good standing up that'll make it easier
so what we're gonna do about 15 of them
I'm gonna squeeze our bum as we stand
back up and we're probably gonna repeat
this whole routine about three times
we're gonna do each exercise test and
then go back so 15 spots to begin next
is gonna be curtsy lunges but you call
them something else skater basically the
same so imagine we're now gonna meet the
cleaning of the president and we are
literally going to curtsy backwards
we're gonna take off it slightly more to
one side then you want to make sure is
that your hips stay facing forwards they
try not to twist your body too much you
should be facing forward it just should
be that one leg is going all the way
behind and here you're gonna do 12 each
leg so it's 24 in total and again
squeeze your bum as you stand up if like
me you need something to focus your eyes
on place something behind you so that
you can see it and you can aim for that
with your legs it makes it mean that you
are reaching it far round as you can
that's such a good idea myself as well
and if you really feel the bird can you
get going especially do them quite
quickly as well and get a really good
rhythm on yeah I find that you can
really feel that deep bird and I love
that okay so what is exercise number
three next exercise we're gonna be going
down to the floor and I'm gonna do thing
called bridge raises this is obviously
in yoga but we can make it a bit harder
if you wanted to by adding in a way but
for now we're doing body weight so
you're just gonna lie on your back
you're gonna make sure that you bring
your knees up so kind of got them a
right angle for your hands that are
touching your ankle and from here when
I'm gonna lift our hips all the way up
the sky as high as you can literally
projected up this guy hold it for a
second and then bring it back down
without touching your bum to the floor
we're gonna do 30 of these and you
really want to make sure that you are
flexing your back holding your core
really really tight and squeezing your
bum at the very top and again if you
wanted to make it harder add a little
barbell just across your hips it's a
little bit uncomfortable but obviously
you can increase the weight there on
that one and the next so we're gonna use
the same exercise that when you lift one
leg up first I'm just gonna make it so
much harder especially after you've done
all the other exercises so at this one
it doesn't really matter too much the
angle of the leg but generally try and
keep it straight that puts more pressure
on your bum and you're just gonna point
up flex your
but and squeeze and again we're going to
do about 12 each leg so you can feel the
burn feel the burn
okay so exercise number five my favorite
one we didn't really know what to call
it did we go so I'm gonna call it
Victoria's exercise for today okay when
you guys do it you've ever seen got a
tweet your hair and day we did
Victoria's exercise lemma this is like
or on all fours basically I'm imagine
that you are stretching your body out as
much as you can
you're gonna take one knee and you're
gonna place it forward as if it could
touch your elbow really try and make it
reach your elbow then a little bit like
a dog peeing I'm sorry for the
description you're gonna take your leg
all the way out as far as it can to a
right angle and kick it all the way back
and behind you and squeeze your bum as
your leg is although behind it's not one
to do fast but it is one to kind of get
into a flow much like in yoga squeeze
everything hold it really really tight
and we're gonna do 15 each side you
should feel like you're going in at your
weight and that your bum is being lifted
and that is a fantastic exercise to
finish with so the whole routine three
times or obviously if you have a little
time then maybe just do it once or twice
then it will amuse you like a 10-minute
workout here so yeah there's an exercise
