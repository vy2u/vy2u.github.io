been london fashion week and it was very
very very busy week for me I think I
went to 13 shows 1430 shows thing about
this Russian week was that I also got to
go backstage with Maybelline which is
around i have used to warn for
since I can remember wearing makeup they
took me backstage to seven of their
shows so I'm kind of going to go through
those different shows tell you what I
got up to backstage and also what I saw
and how about my translate for you in
terms of what you could possibly wear
for your skin your makeup in the coming
month
but the thing is the full it's a
beautiful shade you can just apply it
straight from really tired I don't think
this it needs to be crafted in it
because I so statue out with nothing
sure it delivers its latitude so day one
started out pretty pretty busy Friday it
was first day of Fashion Week so it was
all systems go for everyone it was
pretty chaotic for a lot of people there
I first of all went to the shrimp's
presentation so maybelline were doing
the nails there and had gone for this
cool terracotta nail Michelle Humphrey
who is the head nail expert from
Emmaline she put this really cool
terracotta color together using a red
and orange and a brown shade she mixed
myself individually it wasn't the usual
cherry red style or less box red it was
just a bit more Brown roasted bit cooler
I guess so she put that together for the
shrimp's presentation and that was
matched together like a red lip and
really kashmir flawless skin so next up
backstage with Maybelline I went along
to the fyodor golan show
which I'm really excited about
the head makeup artist Sharon doe said
she put together it's really neon bright
almost chameleon desk I using their
meeblings big eyes palette and grass so
it's got a few different color swap
yellows greens and whites and to create
this really large neon flick from the
eyes just with a brush and a wet brush
into the green and drugs it across the
eye to create a really neat flick and to
accentuate that she also using pink
lipstick that she kind of melted down
with a brush so it was almost like paste
and then she used that on to the
eyelashes to make a pink mascara which
is really cool so the pink and green
went really nicely together turn it into
the water line she added a white
eyeliner which just kind of made the
eyes we bright made them part but made
all calls can't combine you to flick
together
welcome to day two our Fashion Week I've
got some shoes go to today I'm going to
Lucas nascimento show with Maybelline so
I'll be able to show you behind the
scenes with that today i'm wearing
victoria beckham a little victoria
beckham soon there's my little victoria
back and drown and rank these shoes
these are my brand new Jean Vito Rossi
court and white nude oh my god love them
and I treated myself very Natalie to the
new Fendi bag how pretty is this burg
intestine came along and efficient i
went to maybelline was Lucas nascimento
really lovely collection of clothing
kind of a lot of floral foliage patents
and greens blues and kind of Royal
colors so it's quite a nice dark and
autumnal collection so the make up for
this one was again really Kashmir and
polished flawless almost again like the
UC software shares to a really buff into
skin suit is better belly there for the
eyes no mascara but it was just a white
liner to the lower lash line just again
to brighten up the eyes that makes it
pop and then one thing the dip due to
the skin that I love that Maybelline is
that the you said baby lips it smells
like a lip balm big lips however they
often add it to cheek bones or to
anywhere that just needs a little bit of
highlighting and chewiness and it is the
best highlight idea I've ever seen so
all I did was just add it onto the
fingertips and then pass it on to the
skin and it just litter the light just
catches it's so beautiful and it just
looks almost gives you that beautiful
dewy glow that you can never really
achieve with powders that's one of the
best tips I learned this week while baby
lips is my new highlighting Savior
apparently then suddenly came around
this is a pretty busy day for me but I
kicked off the day at the Sophia Webster
presentation so our behind the scenes on
that and this was a very different kind
of makeup look Sharon the makeup artist
had gone for a triad
ballet style so very kind of white
painted faces that would go with these
very large objects a travels place
around the models although I'm sure that
a lot of us will be painting our face
white all that time soon it was quite
nice to see this kind of brightened
effect and Sharon was mentioned the fact
that we should always have a little bit
more light into our makeup and just make
it a little bit brighter and lighter and
fresher so that's quite a nice little
tip so don't always go so heavy and dark
makeup of it it's all about adding light
back into your skin as well so I like
that it then she did something that I
found so so interesting and that for
some reason I've never thought of doing
it but she created her own passel pink
lipstick using petal pink from
Maybelline and again kind of mashing it
down a bit to create more of a paste and
then she mix that with a white cool
eyeliner so she can't broke it off the
eyeliner mix the two together to form a
mob cast a light shade which I thought
was just a genius idea why I've never
thought about doing that I really don't
know if she was adding that to lips so
all the models have a really pastel pink
light pink lips which were really
beautiful against the white again why I
line it into the tear duct just to keep
them Brian popped so so far to this
point I've seen black eyeliner and see
white eyeliner and seen as very pastel
pink lips next up was Monday and I went
on to the osmond show this was a very
different again our different makeup
looks it's quite nice happy we're so
different and matching my collections
Sharon you see dream fresh BB cream
which you use a thing throughout most of
the shows because it does add this
really beautiful more natural appearance
to the skin so she jumped up to the skin
so it was really beautiful and really
flawless and then Ferrante's the eyes is
to really awake and no she's a better
skin concealer tattoo that underneath
especially after she doing the rest of
makeup she added a bit more of that the
surfing was really Lou inated and
brightens then again she went in with
the big lips onto the cheeks and the
keepers bow and all the high places
thanks just
it's just her secret weapon and
hopefully it's seeing them to become my
favorite weapon i'm going to get my
hands and quite a few from now on she
looks so so cool to use and because it
was a glam rock grunge style she was
going for it was all about the black
coal again into the water and stir
making everything a little bit more
Grangier make the eyes a little bit
smaller and everything is have a little
bit more deaths so they came to last day
and that's Tuesday and were two shows
that day's first one being Emilio De la
Morena and for that show again they went
for this kind of BB cream dream fresh BB
cream all over face they use a little
bit more contour using a darker shade
just to kind of get bring a bit more of
a depth to the cheekbones it's meant to
almost look as though it had a full face
of perfect makeup and that had almost
smudged RAF and rubbed off by the model
themselves so the iron was brought into
the very tear ducts as well the way that
when you've had your eyeliner on for
quite a while it falls atay lips looks
little bit messy instead they actually
put it there purposely so it looked as
though it was night for make up a little
bit more smudged they also use a color
tattoo eyeshadow pots which are amazing
if you've ever tried them and the user
shade pomegranate and they rubbed that
into the eyeshadow almost into the
crease to create more of a kind of a
halo wash around the eyes as well so it
was really really pretty and finally it
will see a she show and this is probably
my favorite show in terms of the makeup
because I don't know it was all much
more traditional and something quite
trashing cool about it simply she show
the clothing was pretty far out there it
was sequins camera sequins it was some
patchwork so four sections third to the
collars and themes and dresses and the
main feature were these soft killer red
boots that were PVC leather red boots
ebony high or ankle high huge heels in a
bright bright red so the makeup was put
together to really accentuate those
colors a Sharon was telling me that she
went for this kind of lady of the night
style so it's super traditional
that it was the bright red lips vs big
black lashes again it was just a stream
fresh BB cream Oliver thanks keep it
nice applause and then she got the
models themselves to apply the lipstick
over the top so the use of pleasure me
red lipstick and they got the models to
apply it himself just because I didn't
want it to look perfect they wanted it
to look so it was a model in a dark club
on a dark night and it's a really smoky
cool room and I just applying the
lipstick and mirror so that was the idea
so they're all piont themselves with
pleasure you read and over the top they
added the lip liner in fab orange over
the top just to line everything and fill
everything in and it just really added
that vibrant pop of color so that was
definitely my favorite look of the week
I think that was it so how you kind of
enjoyed this bit of a rundown I hope
your skin you some tips for
autumn/winter although a lot of these
trends i think i'm going to be using a
lot in spring as well so i really like
the idea of the baby lips with really
jewy lock I love eyeliners anyway so I'm
going to be using white eyeliner some
black eyeliners a lot more especially in
a little offline because i often do it
on the top but not as much the bottom so
going to be doing that a lot more and a
little of this idea of kind of melting
down lipsticks with white eyeliner to
make them much more pastel as I love
pastels so I love those ideas so
hopefully gave me a few tips as well any
of the products that I've mentioned here
