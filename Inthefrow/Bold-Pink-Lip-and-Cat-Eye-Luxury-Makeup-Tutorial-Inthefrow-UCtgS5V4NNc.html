makeup tutorial it feels like so long
since i sat down with you chat through a
new makeup look and I'm really really
excited to get started and show you
everything that I did to get this whole
look it's very much about the bald lips
I love this color and I'm so excited to
use it so it's about the bold lips but
more awake and of pink very natural but
still quite statement eye with the very
graphic black liner and your mascara
absolutely in love with and will also go
through my kind of favorite style of
base at the moment too so it's kind of a
mishmash of new products products
absolutely adore and something quite
bold so I hope you like it if you do
then just keep on watching
okay so let's get into thing I'm not
really excited to film this it feels
like it's been agent since I filmed can
I go sit down chatty get ready with me
let's just get into this thing starting
off with the lawsuit million dollar
moisturizer I didn't have this for a few
months and totally totally missed it
it's kind of like an illuminating
moisturizer with this iPhone I don't
need to use any kind of radiant screams
or illuminating basis because it's just
like both in one my under eyes I'm just
going to use a little bit of the SJ edit
lightening lightening late night eraser
this is really cooling and just
brightens up those under eyes a little
bit look the Mandor eyes aren't awful
today but all we see the helping hand
okay for the skin I thought I'd mix up a
little bit and brought out two old
favorites the Tarte Amazonian clay in
the shade light/medium sand and
Illamasqua skin base in 4.5 I've not got
much return at the moment so I thought
mixing these two might give me pretty
good shade for my current skin tone plus
I'm after a really flawless base for
this I want it to be really flawless
really cool graphic eyes and really bold
lips so these are Goodin's
and I think because I want it to be so
Floris I'm gonna use some orpheum 439
brush just makes a little bit of those
on my hair
okay let's hope this is a good color if
not I'll just bronze down my neck later
but I'm shot with fine so I'm just gonna
disperse the product around the face
first
his hair is in the way I've just washed
it so it's super soft my hair so it's
not going to play ball okay perfect
watching that this light looks okay
nothing that bronzer down the neck
cannot sort out as you know I like to be
more bronzed I'm just gonna take off any
excess off my brush on the back of my
hand go back and buff that in this brush
is so brilliant
super soft it disperses product beat so
beautifully like without really taking
the skin it just really helps to buff it
in really nicely I love how soft natural
this looks what's also being really
flawless like it doesn't look too cakey
and it's a really beautiful tone on my
skin that's pretty good I'm gonna go in
now with some concealer and else you
probably know my favorite moments are
bare skin from bare minerals single of
the most about this product is that it's
just packed with product so you
literally just one sweep and there's so
much product that you can put straight
onto your skin it isn't like really dry
when it comes out on the doe foot which
I found some can see this can be where
is this just sort of straight way gives
you all that you need a little bit as
well they use I just washed my little
Beauty Blender it's still a little bit
damp and I'm just gonna bounce that in
to the skin I want to make sure I take
it over the top of the eyelid just all
that area is really perfect okay I'm
happy with that
just a very kind of flawless perfected
base it's still very quite chewy though
which I really love I'm just gonna go in
the road do like banana powder but I'm
really quite liking at the moment for a
very kind of illuminated under-eye look
I'm just going to take that on my
favorite brush a powder right now which
is the multitask
from Real Techniques I'm just going to
tap that underneath the under I just so
don't take off any of the concealer but
just set that into place
it just really helps take away that
shine as well which I don't want the
shine I just want the illuminated Julie
look okay great we're getting somewhere
so the base is kind of almost John but
it's need to add a litt bit bronzing a
little bit contour and my favorite at
the moment is from Kevin Kwan it's the
medium sculpting powder just a super
easy little product and I'm gonna use
that on my Louise Young a 5-1 yl y51 I
think it's gonna take a little bit of
the product just scoop your new
cheekbones
- I usually always do a contoured look
because that's just what I really like
to wear on my own face but this is
perfect for a contour look to be quite
strong block it's not a natural look so
contour all the way just take it onto
top of my forehead on either side I'm
gonna go for some bronzer loving the
Clarins bronzing and blush compact at
the moment this has a blush in the
center and a for three different
sections around the edge which have
different shades in them just going to
take my Armani bronze brush whiz around
the edge use up a little bit extra color
I've just washed all of my brushes if
you can't already tell they feel super
soft again I mean these are incredible
and I probably say if you're looking to
an invest your money in a new brush and
an Armani brush I'd very highly
recommend the large powder brush
I've bought at the same time you don't
need this brush in order to do this the
Real Techniques bronzer brush is just as
amazing so I always like to contour and
get that kind of general shadowed shade
and then I always kind of go over anyway
with a bit more bronzer all over the
cheeks but now my bronze stuff I'm gonna
go for some blush loving this from Kevin
Kwan the creamy glow duo propeller and
chanel shades I'm going to take this on
the Real Techniques jewel fibre contour
brush where's those two together this is
such a beautiful cream who lost shade
because it's creamy it's also really
glowy
it just sets really nicely into the skin
without looking too powdery for
highlighter I'm going to go for the
Anastasia Beverly Hills star light
illuminate so pretty
taking this on a sigma tapered
highlighter f-35 and the tops up jinkx
just happy farms gonna take this is just
the little techniques to off our brush
I'm just gonna just go over all of that
let's make sure it's all blended okay
starting off the eyes I'm going to use
the Burberry rosewood number one one
month two and I sculpt pen this is gonna
be really really pretty all over the eye
and also in the crease without being
overly dramatic a little bit and then
use my zoeva petit crease brush to help
work for into the crease
what's going on with a slightly larger
brush now just a Mac two on seven to
help that got a slightly larger area but
I only want it to be somewhat well as
subtle as this shade can be but nothing
to - not really
and over the eye even more kind of
subtly they Chanel noon light pink shade
might take that same brush actually I'm
just pop it all over the lid I'm kind of
packing the majority on the actual lid
but then also a little bit out on two
creases so the colors blends but the
majority just over the eyelids those
colors are so pretty together they
almost look a bit two-tone because
they're layered and then to the very
very inner corner like literally this is
my inner corner highlight for pretty
much everything and it's just from the
lapel it nude in the shade Rose from
L'Oreal and it comes with this cute
little brush and a finest this is
perfect and I always just use this
lightest shade on the very very end and
it's just the most beautiful in a corner
just to take a fluffy brush take a
little bit of that into the first first
third of my eye as well and even larger
fluffier brush it's gonna go around the
very edge I'm gonna head in with some
brows and I always you see George Armani
I am brown maestro in wench would have
done for like the past year or so I use
it on as your jaw - spoolie but any
spoolie brush with or any brush with a
flat top end like this is exactly what
you need I always find it certainly
matter what product you use as long as
you've got the right brush for brows and
you're pretty good to go
the thing I love about this brush is
that it's double ended so that you can
get your brows brushed through and then
you can get work into your brows with us
one product in your hand there's always
I like nice dark brown brows and when
all the product is on I'm just going to
brush through
I'm gonna go in with the Illamasqua brow
belt
this is to seek universal shade through
those okay brows are done next thing as
well something a very graphic on the
eyes like very black so I found the
eyebrow master I am brow maestro again
this is in the shade black number one
black so that's what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna use the same brush again the
George Armani brush again with the black
you want to take it like half way across
and then gonna win get out I'm just
going to make sure that I've pushed a
lot of that into the very lashes as well
because this looks so much thicker with
that
yeah that's Raptor just a very strong
cat eye that's all I'm going for here
okay just go do the other side now okay
both eyes don't show much you use and
you've got two two hands to do it a
samskara and because I've been getting
LVL lash lips which I think I mentioned
Lotus house for the new vow lashes lvl
lash lectures like a game changer for
makes it just means I've got curled
lashes for like six weeks a time and
it's just amazing so my ahsha's arch
there's so much better at the moment but
I am just going to get them one final
plump and then I'm going to use the stl
it by Estee Lauder mascara which it's
seriously so good I've been using this
everyday since I got it because it
really does cause such a big dramatic
effect on my lashes especially now a bit
more curly so I'm just gonna use the
larger side to build this is so good it
just separates the lashes so amazingly
only on the side is this little wand
which again I find just gets right to
the roots you can separate lashes even
more so that's a lot more product and
then I use it on the brushes as well
I think it's such a massive difference
for my eyelashes okay face dawn last but
certainly not least is the lip color and
I've been so desperate to use this on
film
it's the Anastasia Beverly Hills in
Carina I think I mean how beautiful is
this color it's a fine Coralie neon ii
bright paint goodness so I tried to find
a lip liner that would kind of match it
not really got such a neon one but I
thought this one could kind of work from
Illamasqua in media I'm gonna give it a
whirl and you mean stop quite right I
can always go over it with liquid lip
and at least have the boundaries sword
okay so like I said this may just be the
boundary at least but I'll know at least
from going with the lipstick which is
the main thing okay so that's going with
this bad boy that color is amazing
I've also over drawn a little bit more
time and a little bit larger on the top
a bit fuller all I want to do just to
finish is add a little bit more bronzer
and that is a final look guys I really
hope you liked it it's very pink it's
very bold and I really hope you like it
for maybe a bit for summer look maybe
some a date night or summer night ow
I absolutely love this color and I was
so excited to get using it in a tutorial
for you guys but I still wanted to be
quite a wearable lock and something
where every single day if you wanted to
or you can kind of dress up a little bit
more so I hope you liked it let me know
down in the comments if you did and give
the video a like if so I would love to
know what other kind of makeup looks you
may be like me to do for you that's it
for now thank you so much for watching
as always and I'll see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
