really well today is they new vlog you
guys been asking for much more vlogs and
I have been meaning to do it but I
thought today was going to be quite a
cool look fun day me and Alex are
driving to Brighton as a lot of you may
know I'm working with Fox all on there
adamyourself campaign and so they have
lent me a Vauxhall
Adam for the day which is very very
exciting so we thought we'd drive to
Brighton and I'm gonna see Suzy and Josh
and we're gonna do some pictures maybe
on the pier for the blog and we're gonna
sort of stay out get something to get
some lunch
also if you notice any kind of Lisp
today on this video it's because I have
money braces on which is very exciting
I've told you about it before I think
that I was getting lingual braces so you
can't see them but they're only inside
my teeth but I only have them done about
a week ago so I still got a bit of a
lisp so if you're wondering where's this
list come from that's where okay so in
the car this is the Roxul Adam a lot of
you might have seen the Adam yourself
campaign I am part of which is really
exciting pretty much I have to do is
personalize your own foxhole Adam enter
into the competition and the car that
has the most votes can win that car an
asset on the advert it's all very very
exciting so I'll leave the links down
below for that you enter its voxels more
urban chic city car than their other
models which means it's a percent me
it's just really cute and compact it's
got the interlink system so you can kind
of link up your phone to wear as an
OnStar system as well which means that
you can ring for roadside assistance if
the lifting happens in your car also has
a 4G LTE Wi-Fi so if you need to kind of
blog on the go I can I do our Instagram
or tweet or anything and you're kind of
like a dead zone then you've got the
cars Wi-Fi they'll keep you going which
I really really love about it I can play
my own music through the car I've got
the maps through where it's just all
very very handy and perfect
someone like me so should we get going
baby
let's go I filmed it how about Jimmy a
long time really five years
mr.
thinking this is probably the second
time
yes
you've actually been driving a car
yeah
we're 16 the last time I heard enough
together when you're taking taking us
home they really even I think what
that's the first time I'm actually
probably mad yeah

it's my recollection open
it's a wake up
- go - yeah it is good yeah just I'm
pretty scared of getting these you are
you I just getting used them freaking
out a little bit driver oh yeah it feels
as smooth I think this is pretty cool
like all this kind of funky stuff is

take what we missed again

very cool you get outside it's really
nuts then with the cream okay we made it
too bright inside

me kind of going slightly on that way

buy all their engagement rings and I
just like to loiter and just pick my

was delicious
so that was easy to get your beard down
at all not like a pub floor back to the
car I've had fun it was great really
good fun it was good to see good to see
Sue's back in the night in fact I could
use my phone to open this you can use
your phone on the app to open the door
and we're home is taking us like two
hours get it home a bit of traffic gosh
I am pretty exhausted you guys so good
like four hour drive back and forward oh
yeah we're gonna get in we're gonna get
showers we're gonna chill out and get a
bit food getting some jammers some
Shimomura's this almost makes it like
I'm wearing some sort of skill uniform
sure I also meant to take outfit
pictures today but by the time that we
actually got over to Bryan it was about
quarter past two by the time we got them
we left it went and it took us a while
so by then we then went and saw the guys
obviously has food then we came home
there wasn't really much time in between
to do anything else I really wanted to
get outfit shots and that's worse again
and do some outfit shot soon but I'll
leave it down below anyway well more
swearing so ants on his game I'm gonna
get in the shower get all of this makeup
off and start again getting bed I'm
actually so tired now from that journey
I was mentioned on Twitter that I've
driven to Bryan and back and don't
really fancy doing it again and so many
people have been like yep I wouldn't do
that doing it's not very nice so I don't
know why I chose to do that journey but
it was nice to see Suzy I really wanted
to visit bright and then see somewhere a
bit different for change get out of
London so at least we did that which was
good and the car was awesome so all the
details as well by the way for entering
the Vauxhall Adam adamyourself
competition will be down below so have a
look at that I honestly wouldn't promote
this competition if I didn't think it
was pretty awesome so yes that's why I
got involved in this I'm also big fan of
design and it just kind of really fit
and I just really love the idea and I
honestly thought it was something that
you guys might really really intake so I
know that I've got a lot of ladies
especially those that follow this
channel I think this car is so good for
girls who just want like a little run
around so when I heard about the
competition and the fact they wanted to
get me involved in it and straightaway I
was like yep this sounds right up my
street I honestly think that my watches
for people at like my videos will really
get into this competition and it was
cool today to be able to be lent one for
the day just to play around with it see
what I thought about it have a run
around in it have a four-round would you
do me in it
