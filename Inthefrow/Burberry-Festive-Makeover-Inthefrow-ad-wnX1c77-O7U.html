you may have seen it on my blog actually
I'm a massive massive found a very
makeup it's really effortless runway
inspired gives you such a glow to the
skin but it's super natural as well
there are so many key products that I
think you'll absolutely love and the new
festive collection with the red lip it's
just so stunning all the berry makeups
developed by the berry makeup artist
consultant when you row you have
actually met a few times and she's so
lovely now I'm going to try out all of
the products and have a wonderful very
festive makeover
okay so to begin I had a shear layer of
the fresh flow fluid in gold or agents
applied all over the face and then blend
it out to the edges before I had the
fresh glow fluid foundation brushed all
over the face with the foundation brush
this has created a really natural but
flawless base then the catch me
concealer was used to pinpoint and cover
any blemishes concealing any darkness
underneath the eyes and around the nose
and that was in 0-3 the next step was to
contour so she applied the contour stick
in medium underneath the cheekbones down
the side the nose in the eye sockets and
also underneath the jaw line and then
she blended all of that with a
foundation brush so I looked really
naturally contoured and then for the
highlight she used a fresh glow pen in
nude radiance and with drops of
cheekbones down the bridge of the nose
and also on to the key pittsburg so I
looked wonderfully highlighted then from
the eyes she is a beautiful new gold
cream eyeshadow and applied that all
across the lid using a flat brush just
really working that in and blending it
out
and then she went in with the cream
eyeshadow in mink which was added into
the socket to contour just to define the
eye socket much more sweeping it along
the lower lashes as well to create a
really shot soft shadow and just really
working that in and blending that in we
then went on to a coal and use the
golden brown effortless blendable coal
just along the top of the lash line as
well as placing it underneath the lower
lash line as well just for a really
lovely smoky natural shadowy finish and
then using pencil brushes and blending
brushes its nicest to go along that line
and to really blend that in and make it
much more smoky and sultry just a quick
curl with some eyelash curlers before
the world mascara and ebony it was
applied just to curl the lashes and to
keep them lovely and black and also
quite natural and fluffy
moving on to browse so we brush through
the eyebrows and using them up before
applying the effortless eyebrow definer
in sepia number two and I just helps to
enhance the eyebrows what's keeping them
still quite natural we just applied a
little bit concealer to the lips to make
them more nude before going in with a
lip liner in Rosewood all around the
outer corners now filling in with the
berry kisses and xiulet pink for this
really natural subtle pink finish well
because we wanted to also go quite
festive we also went to the gorgeous
military red liner traced around the
edge of the lips and then finished off
with the festive gold kisses and
military red and also the festive kisses
of military red lip gloss over the tops
with super shiny and beautiful and for a
touch more glow we just went with the
gold glow fragrance to illuminating
powder all over the cheekbones and the
Cupid's bow and then we finished with
some earthy blush on my cheek if you
love the berries girls like I D you can
also get them monogrammed so I had my
