global makeup artist ambassador yeah so
Patrick is here in London for a few days
and amazingly he is going to do my
makeup for you guys so I still flick
back to that you can watch the whole
look once your grace I to show you guys
how this is like one of my like
signature looks just super bronzy glowy
skin and just like a minimal everything
else and I really think that this look
is great for DNA and for any event
little bit yes so just carry on watching
guys and you can see how I got this what
how Patrick got it look I'm gonna start
off by just cleansing the skin it's
always so important to have nice clean
fresh skin before you apply any makeup
and Mina you know that you giving up
every single day is just so that like
that foundation can lay nice and smooth
so everything looks like skin it's good
because it again it takes away like any
like waterproof makeup it takes away my
oils and dirt nothing many more on your
face and as you know um so does America
joke cream this is one of my favorite
moisturizers from from the friend they
really love it for makeup application
because it's not too thick and it leaves
your skin nice and tacky so that
foundation can stick right onto the skin
it really does the job of moisturizing
it and it pumps up the skin so again the
foundation can look nice and smooth and
natural I mean that's really good one it
says do you have oily skin or guys
together i famous dry to more normal now
it was more normally it changes it
changes like in the seasons right hmm
yeah definitely but I think because I'm
really all night we must gain care I'm
obsessed with skincare I feel like I've
changed my skin from being dragged to
quite normal now
I really feel like I mean I've always
been like such like a skincare junkie
even like before I was like in middle
school I would always make my mom just
buy me everything really yep so my can
just look like a complete mess really
and under-eye cream so I concentrated
this product is I feel like such a
savior when when you have that puffiness
underneath your eyes and if there's any
darkness I really love this product
because it really just plumps up twist
again so that concealers and lay nice
and smooth without looking cakey and dry
yeah I'm gonna do the eyes first just a
little while I want like a nice clean
and bright under eye out and because I'm
doing like a more natural bronzer I am
just I'm going to be using a eyes shadow
primer that is more yellow undertone
this is soft ochre by Mac I feel like
it's a staple in so many different
makeup artist kits just because it's a
great eyeshadow primer you always use a
brush I haven't I never use my fingers
um
I use my fingers maybe put a little bit
more concealer in that's about it and
maybe like this too but isn't it take a
little bit but I personally I just not a
finger person I know that a lot of
people are there's no I don't think
there's any right or wrong way so just
preference for me either in this way so
this is the way that I can see me do it
yeah so are we using have a little bit
of foundation just right on the eyelids
so I'm gonna be using linen on that I
think I might mix a little bit for the
whole entire face but I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm going to be using the lemare
translucent powder so this one this is
in the color light and it's really
important just to set the eyelet just so
that there's no eyeshadow skipping when
we apply that I shut up and it really
just all blends out it's just easier
step for makeup artists or just go at
home just so that just makes
process published here - your husband -
I thought to give you guys so I know
that you love like just a nice glowy
bronzy lips I'm going to be using this
is spice rub
oh are you like that one I know what the
good is it's like the most like easy
application it leaves yours do this just
looking nice bronze and but it's like a
nice easy wash of color
do you always um I just love both brands
I just love anything that makes them
feel expensive yeah
as soon as you get clean and blending
brush and just like lend the product up
into the brow bone until you see a nice
about a nice view shadow just to have a
little bit of a pop of like a pinky
bronze I'm gonna put this part just like
right on to the center of the lid just
so that when I the blush and the
lipstick everything blends brick
together have uses them
this color is in golden exactly how I
feel like how what is there you and then
then I honestly mean I don't really go
out that much we maybe just go to our
restaurant so if you're like eating at
restaurants you're so skinny
I don't know so you can see that this
product is it just it just like brings a
little bit of light onto the eyelids I'm
gonna clean this right underneath the
eyes that we have a nice under the night
excuse me uh so it comes with a like a
little talking at the top sighs they're
nice and frankly this is in natural 12
this is from American collection and I
was supplying it with our nice
engagement brush I was like to start
from the center of the face working my
way towards every miracle that I get
really when you have the least amount of
product around that your chin area and
photos and everything it looks the most
natural mmm I should do that more in my
hairline because me I always get
foundation in the hairline it's really I
mean concentrate yeah and other cousins
for the constant she is like my Holy
Grail I really feel like if you are ever
feeling like you need a little pick me
up at night and you wake up like you
wake up literally like I am so naturally
beautiful I don't need anything on today
really okay I need a little bit of
concealer this doesn't I what I'm
seething I say this like one to two J's
like lighter than your skin and a little
bit of foundation
I'm sensing the foundation brush unless
they can blend everything together
everything is a little bit of
translucent powder just right onto the
center of your face I'm losing the mayor
translucent powder this is in the color
0-2
there's really this is right hot to the
center of your face and leaving the
premiere is nice and natural I'm doing
I'm gonna add a little bit of bronze
just to the skin right into the hollows
of the cheek bones so give it what
you're doing makeup is it really like do
you have a cure go to products that you
normally use yeah it's a heartbeat to
use like other products yeah I guess so
I mean I trust the amount of things I do
get trying it's amazing Jim I do like
like the key things like you are
foundation or you know like the key
thing is that yeah like I've used the
Tong launch shades and illuminating
palette I've literally nearly use it
down to the pan yeah so there's a lot of
things that like my stinkles I think but
if they do it for the new hood has been
a staple I know it's amazing
if it can take on a previous tape and I
knew like makes it my foundation to
locks or assuming foundations I'm gonna
take a little bit of the bronzer and
just apply this right into I should have
expected of using bronzers I'm
transitioning others I really like it
brings the look together as a whole and
it just it's very easy it's a great big
brothers make great transition
if you have y'all staples that you might
use it yeah I'd love it if anything
handed without like nowhere a skincare I
can't it without the recommendation I
think it to just photograph stick so
well by a also I don't think that's how
before chain illuminate and that's Tom
for seamless smoke lipstick very I just
need to do like nude yeah so I normally
take like two hours to do makeup so when
it comes to apply makeup my makeup that
oh yeah look I look like a good to half
hours time to do her and then really
take time with everything with the take
time just don't care I just really enjoy
putting makeup though I find it so
therapeutic
right people making our everyday answer
I think I love it what I don't have to
do it too much but I like love it when I
like I really love it like there's some
days I just wake up like I wanted to
make up today I'm using um love less
this is such a pretty blush color
tonight like rosy tone pink has a little
bit of a girl undertone to it I really
like it to look nice and diffuse and it
looks like a nice wash the color just on
so that she thinking you wouldn't think
I went blush was like watching yeah

something new please contact me and and
the crime metric goes there and I'm also
going to go another Cooper offense to

the marijuana after I go ahead and just
like I'm five okay all the headaches
where I want it like a please like
basically on top of the forehead and the
tops of the cheekbones and the bridge of
the nose and on the lips and then I'm
gonna take a little bit of for the mayor
settings great so this mess is a great
product just to have in your like I feel
like if you're like a working woman then
you just need that like a little
pick-me-up

powders that we applied to really just
big step into a skin so like the skin

waterproof extreme mascara found on

of the show out there at the skin

wouldn't do too much on this I little
bit of mascara really like opened them

Chloe skin shine with of using the
cleansing foam from the mare to releases

day and then it's not a little bit of
moisturizer and then keep on the gels
