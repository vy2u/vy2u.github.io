filmed this Sunday four hours before
you're watching it in fact three hours
so I'm going to have to be quick here I
kind of was thinking about not even
filming today because that's how bad I
felt this morning but when I can just
c'mon let you guys down so instead I
thought why don't I film like a hangover
makeup tutorials those days when we're
all feeling a little bit sensitive and
just need something to pick up our skin
again and make us feel a bit more alive
but nothing too over-the-top
say that now and I've literally got all
of these products with mini so I just
pulled out a client this is what I want
to put on today so I'll try mine make
sure it's like cut back a bit and it's
also kind of based on the makeup that I
did yesterday for my night owl I'm going
to like based around that but making it
a little bit more stripped back so I
hope you enjoy let's get into this
rather start off the origins energy
boosting treatment lotion spirits so
this kind of part of the routine like a
good old handle the routine is all about
skin and making skin look amazing again
look how dry my lips look they're not
looking at us it's going to have a lot
of like skin care products and lip
products in everything and when you put
all the lemare renewal oil I mean I love
this stuff anyway but it's going to be
nice and soothing and adds a little bit
more glow into the skin as well I find
it really love it recently I spent
literally passing it into my skin with
my hands like so yeah so like me and
Alex
I've already had a number who literally
had a number of it with go through eight
in the head stick it out bed quite a
while if you like my need to put that
disclaimer out there as well for like
anyone who is under 18 drink responsibly
wait no you're over 18 drink responsibly
if you're under 18 you should not
drinking it obviously use McLaren's
into entire Bible if I miss out anything
some chat I'm chatting everything will
be listed in order of use below as
always I hate having dry skin under my
eyes it's the worst and this just really
helps like with this still the top it's
really cooling so
just you know like a really quick I
Souza jar feeling really good as well
man I let's just sat down he doesn't
have like that wave now on the waves
comes over that second wave oh this is
so nice the new Clarins
monster clinching serum like I realize
you don't have to do I am serum and
moisturizer and primal I can't than I do
but I was fine on these days extra skin
care is just the best way to go
she's lovely she's like brand-new serum
it's very just like watery and yeah also
like I'd barely barely ever drinking
honesty the first time I've been out in
a hell of a long time I think last time
I went out with Lisa and Lydia and that
must be about nine months ago not more
than that no I don't go out drink a lot
or but it was with small friends and you
know have a few drinks and probably one
too many this is so brilliant if you
need like a boost a bit like a more
radiant skin Moxie Gilliam young
meteorites oxygen care moisturizer
radiance booster it looks almost at
pearlescent you put it on but I'm going
to mix it with a bit of the morning aura
from vb Estee Lauder just for you know
that's added Pez out yes got a really
good night is like me and eight other
friends I went travelling wears a few
years bath ground at the reunions the
moisturizer our Nexus because it Molly
now and that second skin care at the
creme de la Mer affecting treatment it
really enhances how my makeup looks a
booger and just makes everything nice
and smooth and also feels is really hard
you're a tune or lathering arm skincare
so nice
okay for the base and I just really want
quite chewy cheery skin so I'm gonna go
in with this is amazing the dryness
recently the Chanel sub Lamar's I've got
shade 20 beige it's quite dark but
moment and quite talent so it works but
look at this it's just so lovely and I'm
just using just using a Chanel brush the
foundation powder brush and it's
literally this dip in the top
why not the most hygienic way isn't it
but it's only for me
Chiron lives I'm using a brush like this
you just still slather quite as much
jump to do its if this is nicely without
having too much in one place and it
blends nicely and I'll still go over
this as well with the sponge so in a got
up late today and then I've been sorting
out some things on my d pop if you
remember that clean out clear out videos
I did a lot of those things a lot of
people message me a pal or commented
about saying that labels quite like to
buy it so I figured I put a little bit
more online so you guys can get your
hands on it so realize that some brands
aren't available some places and a lot
of things now out Starkel are quite rare
so so it'd be nice to you guys to get
your hands on them so Alan's been
helping me with that because there's
quite a lot of things as you saw from
the clairaut video he's been helping me
sort of package things up and get things
ready so there's still loads of things
on there I'm selling a pair of my
Chanel espadrilles my black leather
should a schedule set for and I'm sundar
Chloe say if you're interested but it's
hella luck I'll leave a link somewhere
I'll down below as well for you signal
Peaks she's been doing that for the
morning where I've been kind of watching
how it helps me to that from the bed
couldn't feel all that fantastic and and
it's going to use look like this on a
sponge not too much in fact it's quite
dark yes from jo'burg the phone is so
wonderfully doing and we're going for
that look so I'm not using too much on
the sponge and more padding and I
already have that looks really nice so
it kind of shows a camera that my skin
actually looks really radiant and glowy
like you wouldn't really know I'm going
to slather on at the car max now now
that I've a sit down not going to work
and it's magic and I completely fall in
love with it the Tom for shade and
illuminate this is in intensity one but
internally to is also a nice little bit
darker I always looked at this in small
carts big donor to dance me I also
didn't understand what to kind of deal
with this looks like I really need that
at the moment I'm so into the Jewish
skin lock that I'm all over it and the
other day I have some
makeup done for a user boss shoot that I
was doing and I had the most I had the
most amazing makeup artist Alexa she was
wonderful
I feel like makeup soulmates she was so
amazing and super nice and she kept
using this on me and she kept using the
highlight and I was like oh my god why
haven't I use this yet went home found
it in my drawer picked it out and life
has not been the same since that moment
so as always I've done a bit of contour
but the cream of this rabbiting powder
just allows the skin to show through and
just a little bit more alive and little
bit of shake my console has a temple to
know why I just realize I've not
concealed that's how bad I'm feeling I'm
going even concealed hi conceal then get
taught a shape tape believer Hank people
it's so good
not like low result like little balls or
I say and the drawl that much arm just a
smidge just a little midship if you
submitted right on I'm just going to add
a little bit these have you tried these
yet Dena soft matte completeness alert
they're so brilliant like so so
brilliant I'm just going to add that
over the bluest part to sama color
corrector a little bit as well cuz again
tonight I'm much sleep looking a little
bit drowsy smoosh everything a little
bit okay now in a bit comforter I'm
going to go with highlight and this
stuff is just so genius it's just
wonderful I love it and it's great to
apply it with your fingertips but I've
been using this flat brush from Armani
to do it too but I really hope this
shows up on camera to tell like all lit
from within this makes you go beautiful
Florida sublime tip of Cupid's boom
because Alexa to make partisan
mentioning she did say like in for
normal people to use this it could
potentially look greasy but you know
what I don't actually care would you
love it think it's crappy okay just a
little bit of blush and for this I'm
keeping with the cream vibe and going in
with this beautiful blush it's very
similar to the shade illuminator sister
shade shade illuminate FF 16 any cream
blush you've got again it just helps not
having pounders I think but you
definitely need just a touch of
something on your cheeks I think when
you come go over something that makes
you look alive and a bit rosy how pretty
this brush by the way Skil and brush oh
it's just creamy dreamy brush goal oh
also nothing to tell you about and I'm
selling some cameras to I am selling
this camera my Canon 5d Mark 3 and just
cuz I'm upgrading so I'm showing my
camera and I'm also selling commando and
my phantom 4 Pro drone just because Alex
wants took great fat as well so it's
long a few thinks if you're potentially
interested please send me to tweet me at
and fro and we'll chat about it also
like realistic offers guys I'm not so
gonna be selling the 5d 400-pound but
yeah I'll let you notice in case
anyone's in the market for it and would
like it without a tiny touch of powder
just to any places that do actually need
where I've got a bit overboard let's say
right just for the eyes I'm going to go
back in now with this amazing palette
and show you what else it's good for
which is eye shadow and again something
elected it on their answers blown away
so quite frankly this is the elixirs
makeup routine I have just come and did
it and I've fallen in love so literally
just and straight onto the eyelid your
finger and just pushing it up towards
the crease and then you can just kind of
apply more the actual legend otakus
build it up so apply your base down
first and go all over and pushing it all
go in heavier on the actual mobile lid
here and around the luscious a bit a bit
more in there you know just going to
build up the color
that more gradients but the way that
catches alight optical it's a cream and
it's so easy and so quick sloth that so
much and just sit in a corner and add a
little bit of in a corner highlight with
my favorite in a corner highlight which
inside the la palette nude by L'Oreal in
the Rose shade and it's just this little
little white one here and it comes with
a little tiny brush which is perfect and
a mirror so brows I've been quite
enjoying my light rail recently now kind
of interested in leaving them like this
oh yeah I'm going to do I'm feeling
about this I'm going to go over with the
dark gimme brow just for a little touch
of color and then we'll see where we are
to put this well quite like that I like
it I'm gonna leave it up now much more
natural I want my eyes to super big give
them a very very very good curl like
more curl the normal kind of curl it's a
little wolf back to McClaren's
waterproof is a brand new bottle which
means it's a bit drier right now which
is really good for combing through which
is going on
so this mascara I'm just getting the
overall hold this curl won't move now
with this mascara the Nova trap minor
you see brand-named you're pumping
Volume Mascara it is super cool it's got
like this this bit here it is impress it
so that you can warm up in your hands
which obviously helps and means that
when you pull it out you can just give
it one pump pull it out and it comes
loathly brush and if you like the very
volumize sticker eyelash look like
bordering on almost a bit clumpy err
thick you will love this mascara look at
that that I mean a cow like wide my eye

wonderful trips and they're amazing and
