favorites I've already done my fashion
favorites they were my September what I
wore this month video so head over there
if you're not already
this is gonna be entirely Beauty because
usually I mix them up and then I don't
have enough time to talk about either of
them and yeah I found it in them
separately this time so I hope that's
okay let's just get into this I'll show
you what I have been loving in the day
because of what I do as a beauty blogger
and a fashion blogger etc I get to try
out a lot of amazing products and
therefore these favourites are just a
really nice way to round up what I've
been using the most what I love the most
what I would recommend if I would
recommend something to my mom then you
guys get to see it too
I don't just recommend any old thing it
is just the things that I have been
loving the most and really rating so
let's get into this don't know where to
start so I'm gonna start with these hi
I'm back on the CC 8 cosmetics CC train
once again I'm nearly out of both of
these I mix fair with light fair is a
good shade for me when I'm not turned
light is good for me when I am turned
both together work just really really
well for my skin but the thing with
these is it's Perriman free it's cruelty
free its SPF 50 its anti-aging it's got
a hydrating serum inside it if colour
correcting it's full coverage and I just
think as well whenever I seem to use
he's like there was a run where I use
these for a month
and my skin it was around the time when
my skin had never looked any better and
I feel it was a combination of this plus
nighttime routines and also seeing my
skin specialist it was just like a
triple whammy of goodness because this
has like so many incredible like
skincare properties in them so I'm back
on this bandwagon loving it this is what
I'm wearing today on my skin again in
fact what's I'm telling you about that
I'll tell you what I applied it with
this have you ever seen such a huge
brush to apply foundation I would never
usually use a brush like this to apply
foundation but when I had my makeup done
by Patrick Tarr who is the creative
global makeup ambassador for lemare he
applied my foundation with this so I was
like go on then I'll give it a go and I
am loving it that's all I've used with
my skin today I have
gone over with a sponge anything I've
literally just brushed it and almost
like airbrushes everything on the skin
it means you're not applying too much
like it's not looking cakey now if it
does look cake in any part it will be
the concealer will not be the foundation
of sure it just really buffs it all out
and it gets it on there super quickly
and yeah I'm converted I'm a big fan of
that now big fan
well the other foundation I wanted to
give a nod to actually was this one from
Lancome this is my customized foundation
the idea with this is I'm pretty sure
there's quite a few places around the
country that do it I'll leave a link
down below where you can find that out
cuz I'm not sure if you go to Lancome in
Harrods
they have a machine set up and all it
does is it looks at your skin takes a
little picture of it fine for pigment of
your skin the color and then it mixes
you a foundation psychics that color or
you can go warm out you can go cooler
toned you can make it full coverage
medium coverage like coverage and you
just kind of make your own customized
foundation and whilst it may seem a
little bit gimmicky it's just it works I
am loving this so much I mean honestly
after I had it done like a try it once
that was his nice put it way my drawer
with my other hundreds of foundation so
I get to use now and again and then went
back to it and so actually this is
really really brilliant and it works so
well for me it's the perfect shade
obviously etc so I have been back on
this I like the fact as well it tells
you about the best use before day not
that you can see that these lights but
it tells you when to use it before which
is kind of cool I quite like that I'd
quite like if all my foundations had
that on there so that I knew when to
stop using it and to throw them away so
loving that I'm gonna throw a tool in
here cuz I haven't in a while my Dyson I
have been loving this absolute loving
this again I've realized that if you
don't shake this around it's not meant
to be shaking you know like when you go
to hairdressers and like like this and
they're like shaking it around like a
little maraca
so yeah I've got in that habit now I've
been like shake shake shake shake shake
shake shake so that you don't say don't
get too much heat on the head which is
what you do the normal hair dryer you
don't really do this with this hair
dryer it's meant to be kept static and
then you move your hair through it
yourself with your other hand or with
the brush and you can blow-dry or
anything and that I've been using this
I've been to my hair upside down and
just using this but really lightly move
not like blast blast blast so while I
was fine that when I use this it would
give me really naughty hair and I didn't
understand why and then the sooner I
realize I actually want to keep it
steady when you hold it it's totally
great now it works perfectly it's really
really quick it's quieter than normal
hair dryer yes it is on the pricier side
but it just works like it just works so
well and I mean how cool is it just
looks so cool huge fan of the Dyson so I
thought I mentioned that but it's kind
of like anything that makes drying this
long Mane quicker is okay with me in
skincare I have it Estee Lauder advanced
night repair I concentrate matrix this
is like their new eye cream to go along
with their classic and highly loved
advanced night repair concentrate I use
this in a very unhygenic way I guess
because I'll let's just go before bed
and then pat pat pat pat with my ring
finger all over the outside of the eye
it just feels really hydrating very
moisturizing I mean this is the kind of
thing I would probably recommend if
you're kind of over a certain age I
wouldn't say you necessarily need this
if you're a lot younger and you have
much younger skin I mean I'm nearly
thirty now not that I'm saying that I'm
super old but it's always good to start
early I think with your anti-aging and
skincare but I'm just really really
loving out I just love the feel on the
skin it's not too silly Cody it's not
too heavy it's not too light though very
nice in between up and use every single
day since I got it and my undereyes does
feel really lovely and hydrated and in
really good condition I guess at the
moment so I'm liking it a lot couple of
lip products first of all starting off
with the creme de la Mer lip balm balm
de la Mer this obviously is on the
pricey side of the balm scale but I
would say at this point that I prefer
this to the back Terry Baume De Rose I
prefer it to my trusty Carmex and I
prefer it to Burt's Bees although I love
all of those this is the one that if
there are laid out in front of me and I
was rushing out the house this is the
one I would pick up there's something
about this texture that smooth super
soft very hydrating but also something
quite mattifying about it I don't know
what if it's meant to be but it
certainly doesn't have that sometimes
when you apply a balm and makes you look
really shiny and a bit lacquered and
like they've got those product on them
this after putting this on the lips just
look like they have this moisturized
hydrated
locks they're built like
have a topcoat on them anything like
that I almost feel like it just
mattifies and helps the lips look more
plumped and fuller and then it creates
this great base for lipstick so I don't
really like doing my lips now without
this bond I think it's just brilliant
and it has a gorgeous sweet minty quite
not really overpowering minty but lovely
minty smell tip - I love it so much a
few of the lip products to mention the
balm and L'Oreal Paris lipstick
collaboration if you did say already
some of them are very very colorful some
of them are nude some of them are very
wearable while others are very daring
and bold and strong but the one for me
was just so one that was the nude and
I'm a big fan of this I'm an urban
Safari it's just extremely nude yeah
just really beige nude barely any real
pink in there it's just that ultimate if
you want quite a matte very nude very
light colored lip this is great so I've
been using it quite often I'll either go
fully all over so when I was away with
L'Oreal I'm gonna do very very nude lip
I just did this all over if you just
want something in the middle of the lips
I quite often dude just ombre the center
then it works an absolute charm so check
out the balm on lipsticks if you've not
already they are really really great and
I think I have already mentioned this
before but I'm just gonna mention it
again because I'm still on the height
I'd say this lipstick the Alexander lips
and boys lipstick from Tom Ford it's
still by far my absolute favorite
lipstick of the last few months and
there's something about the texture of
this the finish is almost like a silky
sheen to the lips nothing - I'm just
gonna put some on it's not shiny
I just I'm supposed to touch of
something else when you pull up to tell
now because I've got four different
lipsticks
it just catches the light without being
shiny and in-your-face and it's a
wonderful and now it's another nude but
this is a beige rosy nude and I think
it's the lightest neither doing this
collection and it is so me I can just
put this on without anything else and
it's the perfect shade don't go anywhere
without that lipstick now in body
products I have the being by century spa
salted caramel and Mac
damn your body wash I'm almost out of
this I think I'm I mean I'm just shaking
up so it's everywhere but I think I've
got this much left nice anything by
sanctuary most of my body washes and
shower creams are by century and I just
like them the most it just the love
they're really well they smell
incredible
they're extremely affordable because
buyer in Boots whenever you're in there
this one just smells like a dream it's
like an ice cream dream I mean alex has
also been stealing this which doesn't
bode too well with me when it's a
favorite but at least he smells amazing
- two highlighters are catching my
attention right now and I cannot get
enough off this stop being with
Charlotte Tilbury Beauty light wand this
is a cute little sponge and that's what
I'm wearing right now
it's just something quite subtle about
this but it blends so nicely to the skin
that it almost just looks like skin
that's extremely luminous it's very very
easy to apply
anyone could apply this and get it right
you know like it doesn't look ridiculous
or too much it's just a really gorgeous
easy travel friendly product and
honestly I wasn't gonna mention this
because I've mentioned it so often in
blogs but it has been the favorite so I
have to really the RMS Luminizer
highlight I just like taking this either
on a brush or on my fingers and
literally just and this is the most
incredible jeweler I absolutely love it
quite often I'll just wear that alone
without anything else underneath and it
just looks like your skin is glowing big
fan and also again super travel friendly
so handy happiness with you and the very
last product to mention is this beauty
of a package this is the skin perfecting
powder from Victoria Beckham it's the
only powder I've been using since I got
it therefore it's a little bit dirty now
inside of here but I mean the packaging
is super luxurious it's gorgeous just to
have in your bag in the first place
it doesn't cake it really takes away
about shine I just I feel like it just
blurs and perfects the areas that you
put this onto I'm really really big from
this and I think it works really really
well so this is all I have been reaching
for since getting it it is very pricy
for a powder but I think it's this
luxurious beautiful factor as having
this package
it's just a gorgeous product to have I
know some people would argue it's not
about the packaging it's about the
product inside in some cases I
completely agree but there are other
times especially when it's not
travelerbill items or things that you
will take with you in the day but it is
nice just to have that lovely product
that you love looking at and you love
holding and you look
oh you look taking out your bag I think
there's something in that that makes me
feel nicer when I'm applying things not
all the time and I don't think it's
necessary but it is nice it's the same
way that you feel when you've got a
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick or Tom Ford
lipstick or a beautiful brush that you
love using like I think everyone could
probably think of one product they love
that they like to get out and maybe show
off a little bit that is this whilst it
is practicing is also about the product
I do really like this product as a
powder I'm gonna continue using it I
think it's great it works for me I don't
have to powder too much in my face so it
works really really well for me in the
areas I wanted to it takes away shine in
the way I like without removing any glow
or any luminosity from the skin and that
is it for beauty products for this month
those are the items I've kind of come
into my routine or I'm still using in my
routine and I just really wanted to
mention them to you because I feel like
they're pretty damn awesome and I'm
really really on the height for those
for anyone that's wondering about my
eyes I went super smoky cranberry today
I'm quite enjoying it I use the new
zoeva cafe shadows for this look with
these cranberries I'll be honest this
this cranberry here with the shimmer
wasn't quite pigmented as I hoped it
would be but a few coats it looks pretty
great so yeah that's what I used and on
the lips I have the Lumiere lip balm
with the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood
lips in deburred over the top floor so
those are the lipsticks that's right um
and just in case any of you are
wondering again actually this is a great
incredible product I really did want to
mention any one products but yes this is
also incredible for liquid lips this is
one of the absolute best out there right
now the tip of this is extremely easy to
apply almost like grips onto the side of
the lips when you apply it and it really
does enhance the shape and size and feel
and it's not at all drying it just looks
absolutely gorgeous and matte anyway
leaving it there leaving it there now I
hope you enjoyed that guys quick roundup
of what I've really really been into
this month in terms of bee
what I would highly recommend you invest
in if you were thinking about it so I
hope you enjoyed that the only thing I
haven't really mentioned is perfume this
month and I asked him it's because
there's been so many new perfumes out do
your laws come out Chanel Gabrielle has
just come out the new Tiffany fragrances
Jean Paul Gautier scandal fragrance
there are a lot of new fragrances and
I'm really really loving those
especially as I just mentioned all of
those I've kind of been alternating a
lot between so I'm not really got any
absolute absolute no more favorite right
now but I would say if you did want to
know what I am loving the absolute most
it would be the Armani Prive Rouge
malachite which i think is probably up
there in my top three fragrances ever
ever ever ever some very very special
fragrance oh I love this smell so much I
mean this packaging now me it's just
ridiculous play so that's my water now
only but when it comes to kind of frame
this is like to mix up I haven't got one
at the moment now I'm loving the most I
