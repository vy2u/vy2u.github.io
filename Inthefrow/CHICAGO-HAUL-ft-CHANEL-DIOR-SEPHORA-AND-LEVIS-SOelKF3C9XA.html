setting and a lot of you guys may know
I'm currently in Chicago so we're in the
Hamptons you should have seen that vlog
by now if not it will be on the screen
somewhere and then we came to Chicago
for a few days my best friend lives here
and it's like mine and Alex's holiday
chill-out place so we're just here for a
few days and we went shopping so I
wanted to show you one I hold what I
bought
in Chicago we walked up and down at
Michigan Avenue for quite a few hours we
were lots of other things and I want to
show you what a picture
so for ages since I did a haul so it is
really really nice to get filming again
first up on the agenda is this hoodie I
got this from Levi's and I'm wanting
something super casual very oversized
very chill out I can wear it in the
house at home I can wear it here it's
just something to throw on when I was
little bit super chill about and believe
it or not I don't actually own any other
hoodies I'm pretty sure I threw away
loads of Hajis that got really old I
don't have anything super slouchy and
dead chilled out like this so I saw some
Levi's I loved it I thought I mean I
don't often when read reform I've been
wearing more red to really enjoy red
so yeah so I went for really really
liked it so I've got the big like leave
a nice print on the front two pockets no
standard hoodie but I got it in a medium
so it's super oversized and really cozy
otherwise I went to the for our my
outfit favorite I always go in Sephora
whenever come to America just like every
other person does I'm still holding out
that day when they come to the UK and I
picked a few kind of old favorites a
couple of newbies and some more travel
kind of essentials first on the list the
two ceased hangover replenishing face
primer I'm pretty sure I don't have this
already I've definitely not tried it I
don't think but so many people YouTube
talk about how amazing this is
and I got bit jealous I've never tried
it before try the bit on the back of my
hand in the store and it just feels so
hydrating and nourishing the kind of
thing you can slap on the day after
you've been out drinking or after a fly
and it'll just like sink into the skin
and to make it super juicy and lovely
again and that's what I want to try so I
thought seeing as I've had so much highs
was about time I pick
so I can't wait to give that go and let
you know how I get on with it no doubt
it's amazing it will be in a new slog or
it'll be the new beauty video really
really soon to tell clothes beauty
videos I really hope you saw my latest
Beauty video which was a cabe UT
makeover love that video so so much I
feel like Lo as you haven't seen it so
I'll leave it linked on the screen now
if you'd like to watch that legislate my
base looked like perfection so if you're
asking some new products make sure you
go see that and all favorite that I
absolutely love and run out of is to
indicate online setting spray I
currently have the much larger bottle
with me I use it every single day if I'm
not using that I'll use all the types of
setting sprays but it's probably my
absolute favorite but these are perfect
the travel size while it's just me going
away and they go away so much it's so
much easy to throw this into my makeup
bags than the massive massive bottle so
I figured I'd pop and I buy a new one in
terms of value for money yes it's better
to buy the bigger one or in terms of
weight and trying to like save on a bit
of weight in your baggage this is a gem
so I picked up a new one of this it's
honestly one of the absolute best if you
haven't tried it yet and you're looking
for the setting spray
I'll know of setting sprays I also
treated myself again to the catcher dewy
skin mist this is so brilliant it really
is and it's expensive I think it's about
$45 but I'm going to keep this for more
special events and occasions that I'm
going out too so it's luminous dewy skin
mist if you've not heard of this already
it's but it's a setting spray that has a
little bit more luminous kind of not
gonna see sparkly glittery but it's a
luminous set particles inside there that
just make your skin look a bit drier and
more glowy
it's nothing like mega crazy and if
anything I can of wish it was more mega
crazy cuz I'm a little bit more
luminosity but it's certainly helped and
I do really love the way it looks or
else I wouldn't have gone and spent
another $45 on it so I bought another
one of those bad boys
another little travel essential another
Brazilian boom boom cream I have the
huge bottle of this I mentioned this
about top of this I mentioned this a few
weeks ago in another beauty favorites
video but things I picked up and I got
this it smells absolutely designed okay
just got it on Muller yep
oh my goodness it's incredible actually
generally reminds me of this realize the
laura mercier i think it's a creme
brulee body range that they do a bit of
that makes them to vanilla once it's a
bit vanilla a bit soft creme brulee not
too like ridiculously sweet or sickly
it's absolutely amazing
that's it alot this and it's meant to
have some caffeine in it so when you
stick it on your legs it's meant to help
out with that I don't know how much that
to help I always feel that's always a
bit of a myth that's absorbing it's just
a really lovely body cream and it smells
incredible
and that's all I want so rather than
taking the massive tub with me as we're
ago I thought buying a little one was a
great idea so I've got that for my next
trip I picked up the SC nail polish in
three g15 - I don't generally use nail
polishes I always get your luck but a
couple of my nails have broken in the
past few weeks and which meant that the
shellac came off I needed to get
something to match my shellac this is so
perfect I could not pick to my perfect
color it literally like Alex can you
tell which nail isn't shocked nobody
I want to guess yes there you go see
perfect this is the Fiji one five - I
always get my nails she liked every two
weeks at drive-by London it's my
absolute favorite salon if you're
looking for a new nail salon try it
it's amazing the staff Annette fantastic
and I look so on the nd shellac in the
very baby pink color I can't of the name
of it right now
what Fuji 1 phi2 matches perfectly so
not so good one who I also treat myself
to a brand new nav creamy concealer this
one is in vanilla there's one that goes
even lighter than this porcelain
porcelain is lightened this is the
lightest this is the second lightest
this is vanilla
I have canal and else have creme brulee
which I love their little darker and
they're actually the ones up from this
in fact the shade range in terms of
lighter colors isn't massive but I
wanted something that's a little lighter
just to even add more highlight I guess
underneath the eyes and brighten them up
whereas the canal and creme brulee are
perfect for matching my foundation and I
can't do my foundation without that
concealer now I love it so much so far I
just try one little bit lighter again
just shows how much I'm lovin s if I
want to get a new color in that and then
on the lips
today I went for the bite lip pencil lip
pencil in 50 and face was quite brownie
Mo's the most definite lines through
it's got a bit of a kalila cute
undertone to it awfully not like really
heavy lilac a book certainly got tinted
that in there it's not this soft as
creamy as lip pencil I've ever used I'll
be honest now that I've used a little
bit more of it it's getting to work a
bit better and it seems to be a lot
better now than when it first used it
when it's been perfectly sharpened and
it was brand new now it works a lot
easier it's all little more creamy but
it's not the creamiest like it's not
like a Rimmel pencil like I use every
single day or a Mac but I'm going I'm
going to get used to it and quite
enjoying the courses i acquire cool
shade and then I also treat myself to a
new deal lipstick I don't know why I did
this because I think I own every single
deal lipstick there is going I love them
but I don't think I have this nice entry
this is three one six in incognito and
again it's like a move Brown this is the
Philip stick you are added lipstick it's
got quite a satin almost with a glossy
Sheen nothing too glossy but it's a
little bit wet look on the lip it gives
the lips lots of shine and the light
bounces off them without them being
super glossy and it's comfortable it's
got bits of Barney feel to it very
comfortable and very similar very very
soft I don't know really wanted it when
I was in the show up so people I'm sure
I'll get home when I'll do one of these
in my drawer but I really would want to
do it when I was in Sephora so that was
my support hole so this jump that all
those things from Sephora and then I
bought two more things so a massive base
so we went along to Saks my favorite
department store in America because it
seems to sell everything I would say it
kind of equates to Selfridges in the UK
which is my favorite store in the UK it
just sells but very thing especially the
shoe section I have from gear to Chanel
- Jimmy - Miu Miu Prada everything is in
there that many stores around that have
all those brands in one section we can
just walk from one to another and that's
what makes it so nice and shoppable the
shop assistants never like Danny throw I
really like shopping
anyway I came across two new pairs of
shoes in the Chanel section that I can't
seen before and they're brand new for
fall and I was totally smitten I mean
it's my birthday on Tuesday June 18th of
July is my birthday so I'm going to
treat myself a lovely shoe so much so
I'll show you what picked up we're still
in this little book these I am extremely
excited about actually I've been asked
to a pair of sneakers now for a while
that I could wear to the airport and
when I'm traveling you know you guys
know how much your travel I wanted a
really cool pair of flat shoes and I
think the sign Iguchi ones a while back
so soft and I loved but then these ones
have just topped them off
can't see what you think of these so
these are Parrish nail sneakers like I
said this is 417 which makes total sense
we've got a real like space-age bag to
them with a silver metallic which
totally matches with the whole space
trend that they did on the catwalks for
417 I've just never seen anything like
these I love big CC Chanel logo on the
side I love the metallic the soles are
the full it's literally like astronaut
shoes I think that he's thinking and
this is a really gorgeous dark rich
velvet blue I mean I'm not too sure what
this fabric is I'm guessing it must be
some sort of like metallic silver
leather maybe like a coated leather
potentially and that's what I imagined
in and then silver threads around the
outside
I mean they're so different and a lot of
you maybe like a little bit bit odd but
on a surface it is so cool and they look
supercool on actually I tried them on
the store the pair of shorts looks
awesome
yes these are going to be my new airport
ooh I think they're super cool and like
I said I've been out of them for a while
so thought to yourself hey let the
county suit you think let me know down
below what you think of these don't be
too harsh if you don't like them it's
our personal opinion I'm a big fan and
the second pair are also from Chanel and
me and don't usually go and buy two
pairs of shoes from Chanel at the same
time but in elf in Chicago I saw them
you never know what's going to see them
again
it's been a lot of times from seen
Chanel shoes I've never seen them again
actually different stores have different
thighs so so I'll get them it's like a
birthday treat again these are a brand
new pair
of Chanel boots you guys know I wear
boots to death in the next month or so
when it starts to get a little bit
cooler again in London I'm back into my
group collection so I have added to that
instead with a brand new pair from
Chanel this is a fabric of black fabric
two knitted and in there inside of
threads is this like I'm guessing it
will be like a collector's thread that's
running through it but it catches the
light beautifully so this is such like
an event to boot you could wear this
with a gorgeous pair of leather trousers
black super tight black jeans shorts and
it's going to have like super tan legs
are really smooth and with a bit of oil
on them where they use a little black
dress and they're going to look so cool
I'm really excited but I also love the
toe it's lovely pointed toe and it's
capped so it mimics the mules that I
also have and that people went crazy for
like last season the mule toe love that
so much and that same matte fabric goes
just around the top of the boot and it's
a matte color so I don't know it's just
such a lot of contacts between the maps
and then this really cool it see boot
silver hardware and it says Chanel here
across the back and silver and this heel
isn't too slim either they're not
difficult walking routes are super
comfortable I got these in my normal
size I hope you guys are and - I'm so
smitten other thing they're amazing so I
can't wait to see what you guys think
and that was my final purchase actually
no it wasn't my final purchase I then
when it bought Alex a little top because
he loved it beautiful I would crown them
a queen top pointing that as well
yes so that was the whole and we had
offer the best day by the end of it it
was like we must have been out about
seven hours sharp erm I got sell books
we've got food it was a still channel
we're not going to the bar right after
it and just chilling out and looking at
everything with God we have the birthday
didn't way that just one day so yeah so
I hope you enjoyed this haul guys I
really enjoyed put this together really
chilled I don't have my lights with me I
don't have my usual set up I just want
