and me and Steph we're super chilled we
don't want to do that the whole like
touristy thing go do loads of things
today we just want to like this chill a
bit so we're gonna go for a walk through
Hyde Park so I thought it's perfect time
to maybe get some block shots so I'm
just getting myself ready something
getting reading I thought I just gonna
show you the last of my getting ready
this because of I'm gonna be taking
pictures I want it really nice like
Christmasy red lips stepped on a red lip
I've done it with a mixture of the city
armani ecstasy shine in 506 which is
such a god it's like raspberry the
raspberry red cherry really comfortable
a bit barmy very shiny almost like this
lacquer affair very sort of she a
lacquer that you can build up so it's a
really kind of high pigmented color
while still being really like quite
shiny and Barney so put that on but then
I realized I wanted a bit already sort
of put him with one of my absolute
favorites which is just the Rouge
ecstasy in number 400 which is like the
signature red Armani shade so I just
sort of got over the top with that and
and as for curl sort it a little bit
more matte for the pictures and now I'm
gonna do my eyes we were finished with
my eyes learn to use the Armani
Christmas palette I get these every
single year and they're absolutely
amazing when he have ten shades these
four here or more get to it glitter
shades up top gold blue a grey brown and
a lovely silver then you've got a super
pearly white and also a matte black and
then you've got a matte purple emo like
plumbing purple very dark blue black
light blue grey tone or like a grey and
the offset big big mirror and then under
here you've got a big powder she's
perfect just kind of mapped mattifying
during the day whatever and you've got
two concealers one slightly lighter one
slightly darker two sponges again you
could use the one sponge it like again
mattifier so it's such a great on the go
palette you got everything in there it's
comes with a pouch and it comes with 2
eyeshadow applicators 200g beautiful

of intensive colors tell you what little
being this close in here I'll say that I
need to do my eyebrows right a smaller
brush into this beautiful purple shade
okay so I'm just gonna go for out the
corner with this now I'm not gonna go
too over the top because I'm wearing
this gorgeous red lip and I think

look a bit much but that color like the
pigment to that is gorgeous I literally
dab my brushing twice very gently just
typical better product and he's like
clean brushes as well so this very
pretty grey shimmery I'm gonna put that
here
wow that is gorgeous my brush isn't wet
by the way that it's just literally warm
dab onto the palette and then onto the
eye that is so nice the white shade I'm
gonna put this into the inner corner can

bit more over the gold just to get it a
