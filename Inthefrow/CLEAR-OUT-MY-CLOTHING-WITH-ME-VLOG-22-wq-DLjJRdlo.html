washed my hair it's got a bit great I
went to the gym this mod in a really
really good session feel great me nights
we've been packing quite a bit for this
move as stressful as it is and I just
want to go through my closet again if
you guys watched my recent well teresa's
flip out three months ago our wardrobe
clear out video but all this is going to
go to charity because in honestly I
don't have time to sell it I'm so sorry
I wish I could so I thought I'd pull
some things out and start making a bit
of dent in it now so the things I take
up the next place are like things I
absolutely adore so I thought I would
bring you up and still do really bright
okay so which I get really hot get it
really hot in my hair or my comments
will be Google my hair looks like when
I'm just very rough blow drying it which
is all I ever do I don't have a blow
dryer prop so let's do this I'm just
going to stick it in here and hopeless
okay so this is my church blouses and
tops I can't even tell you how excited I
am about this new flat I think I said
this before we have three rooms and the
third room and I get a fight my closet
we have another one for an office so
it's been like a really small tiny light
one bed bedroom so I'm turning into a
full-on closet space Lord your space so
I've been looking at the most amazing
IKEA storage units that are like big
hanging rail things and they have like
drawers in them and different sizes
rails looks amazing so I'm so excited
but I still wanna kind of cut down on
the things I have now so I thought I'd
kind of something rap shit' I'm doing
show you how I'm clearing out a little
bit so once you can all see the white
shirt he'll love it
this is a Philip slim top and I love
that have not worn it and worn this
since I wore it for last summer but it's
beautiful and it still and I can try to
get rid of that another literally so
difficult equipment shirt can't get over
that and tomorrow man some are loud but
you really still like that with the
frills no so I messaged my friend while
my best mates earlier and I text I was
like now I'm moving soon I'm doing a
clear-out do you wanna come round
raid my closet and raise my beauty
selection and choose lots of things for
yourself
and she pretty much just a sham so blue
you've got what you need to take
everything so I think she would actually
look really really cute in this shirt so
might take that out for her don't want
to get rid of things the sake of it that
is a very pretty little risk top this
smash top goes with the match long short
for a house I can't trap yet with that
and this is a little pink on top now
people knees sorry guys and then you're
probably here to see me cook things out
but this isn't happening so fast you
cute love love that moves are that's key
to fall so cute to get something pretty
good that now when it comes to dresses
this is my dresses what does Sam I think
I hear that again I absolutely love and
I don't want to get rid of so it's hard
to say I love everything too much I'm
sorry too much let's have a look in this
draw of what I've got okay this drawer
is where I keep my t-shirts and things
that I don't necessarily think me like
hanging not if I love the summer but I
don't really think I need any mask
before in a classy time oh here's a
slinky dress I wonder the day I love it
why is it in here and he's filling the
dresser section now that you can fit
still even though I start at all this
little top it's super cute but it's very
summer and let's be honest we're coming
out some soon give it away give it away
could we now now that I actually really
really love this little Bardot so I
might keep that to where the girl knock
on them or winter some holiday love
these TPCC little revolve body suit is
black buy suits absolutely love those
and keep them away in that color and in
a coral and you might see me wearing
these on Instagram which is really
really cool stubble to wear exact I kind
of want to put one now I might put on
the black caramel sack okay much better
and very pasty white I just exfoliated
this is a long a soft t-shirt dress
thing that I bought to wear with
oops but I just don't really want to
anymore pouring of times now this is
cute this is a really cute is t-shirt is
from Pinker and the front it's like a
crop nose and it says the crybabies and
the back it's got Johnny Depp and it
says the crybabies on it really sweet
laptop I'm going to pull it out actually
and use that as something to wear that
that's very cute Becky got a denim shirt
in here that I do not wear no way I'll
probably grow all the food like why did
I give it to now no I really love it
though when my friends come round I can
give them too many beauty products
awesomely put my fashion pieces that
I've got that I no longer really wear
and it doesn't totally that lights up
their day you just help them out a lot
so I really love doing that makes me
feel happy to this little part can't get
rid fax is great for holiday all right
getting down on this a little bit it's
good it's really good get it down to my
damn teeth just like I'm some tea Jethro
keeping that look it'll love it and so a
rocker at heart can't take the rocket
out of the girl no matter how much she
likes to dress like Victoria Beckham so
many body food in every I've got black
and white bodies a sleeveless sleeves
full neck low neck CNET every type of
body suit possible I have it here a
little feel apart this was very cute for
holiday might keep it just as like a
little holiday peace is that coming more
camis might get rid of it because it's a
little older now quite a nice little top

here from Dior I've never used that yeah
not pretty is this might potentially
have this up on the wall in my new
office on the module closet I might do
it like pinned up on the walls it's a so
pretty I think I can very recently went
through my collection of skirt and sing
actually so you don't have any point
okay guys now this has been going on for
so long now that I think when I cut this
up there's going to be a bit too much
potentially it's looking pretty good
actually imagine to cut down a bit if
needed doing some feeling good now my
own wardrobe is this one as you may
remember which has all my large coats
Blazers so
small jackets and then showers and I've
kind of gone through it almost pull out
a couple a bit also guys if any of you
can help me this incredible dress I wore
in can for the amfAR gala I want to get
it caught it's actually amazing but it's
a super long link and I've never been
able to work like this again so it's
going to credit caught too like a
ballerina link so I need a good tailor
that can cut this and make it like a
shorter dress so that I can wear it more
if any of you guys know an amazing
tailor in the kind of West London way

just how bad I look in this video I want
