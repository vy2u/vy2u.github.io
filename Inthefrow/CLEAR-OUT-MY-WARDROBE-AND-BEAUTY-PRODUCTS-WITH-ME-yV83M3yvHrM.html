to bring you along today in a more
blocky style as I'm having a clear out

my wardrobe and my beauty cupboard I
figured I bring you on with me I did
this a few months ago and told all my
friends in the light you did feel it
right right now to even think about
filming it so remember this time I'm
going to bring you along so you can see
what I'm doing what I'm throwing out and
how I organize everything I guess so I'm
first things first and I really need
okay xpeke
I'm going to get a bin bag and I'm going
to get a normal bag and when I go
through everything on a kind of bullet
right I'm going to make a bag of things
to give to friends and I'll cut a bag
charity and also ones for the big some
things in this beautiful that I think
are quite doc throw those away I'm going
to get the table stash for more space in
the bathroom yes looking at the moment
in the bathroom it's a little bit
clearly like little and down here
well the kind of excess product and then
in here is my beautiful words which I
can't for anything else in now so this
is the long overdue but I know there's
lots of things in here that I like
really old I get the back that never
going to use and really old now to live
it off so I'm going to have a matter
clear out you show you am doing right so
first why I'm going to clear out my
shampoo covered is ridiculous I've got
so much into it right please the Paul
Mitchell shrimp super strong shampoos
are like some of the best things ever
would have had these it must be going on
like four or five years it's gotta be
so unless eternal I know
oh gosh I calit2 looking and I just
happened because ii are covered and of
other things up now as well I just want
you then good an officer free up so much
space that is a lot more face I also
kind of like to do this by like
categories and by background so that
like a Vader Ed Catmull Orioles out in
pure ology nice secret everything so
let's see I'm thinking let's have a pure
ology section now that is conditioner
then the C hydrate range and the purple
which is my absolute favorite so maybe
I'll have a little
this is amazing so I've been fine to my
hair recently haven't been feeling right
it's it's not been feeling its normal
condition and these bad boys are
changing my life including this there
have literally changed the game for my
hair extreme mega mask and obsessed with
this so we have a red confection for all
of my favorite red can products you can
either their wave aid now I don't know
why that's in here because that isn't a
shampoo conditioner and death function
being here okay perfect so pure ologies
there let's get the lungs out of the
bathroom oh this is really good hair
cleansing cream if you like a really
amazing cleanse that is awesome
rights I've got pure ology med camera

my Veda put my Philip Kingsley office
riser in there that's looking better I
cut out some TV as well throw away which
I've had about three years so that's
much better now so now onto this level
and so I've got a footnote back that's
light and was perfectly thing ever if
you're white blonde and you want purple
I was like a lilac term light and that
is so good if not I'll be honest this is
Matt's like favorite Loreal Pro silver
and when I last know what I use if I use
just found this is it back of my
cupboard and it looks and smells in
anything
intense nourishing masks that is what
I'm all about okay so I'm going to make
sure all this is a little bit for the
forward so I can see it on my L'Oreal
alvey's because you're going to can't
really beat this range is incredible if
you're looking for more mid price range
of amazing
these conditioners and it means now I
actually have room to put in my mouth
shampoos which you watch my channel a
lot you will know I am obsessed with
this product so I've got a couple of
these can stick and ooh okay Channing
area seek to have like some creams in
here rather than just coming products
