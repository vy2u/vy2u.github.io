it's been actually a really really good
day I started off the day feeling a
little bit low to balance this morning
just a bit like a lot of things are on
top of me a lot of things on my to-do
list and just worrying a little bit
about Fashion Week's coming up and just
very silly things we're just kind of
health it a little bit stressed I feel
so much better but less overwhelm now
and wrote everything down to less less
really really helped to gave Alex a list
I had a list really great meeting as
well today which really put me in a good
mood so I'm feeling pretty good now also

as you know this is very cool like a
black bodysuit
I guess so much wear out of this black
bodysuit this cute little pom-poms just
on the v-neck it's beautiful actually
gorgeous little green and slinky cami
for the next hour so I think I'm just
going to do a few more emails and get
through this list got a list of things
that I need to do that not done to stay
up six I've been out it's obviously a
fashion month it's coming up we've got
New York on Saturday
we've got London and not do Milan this
yet but I'm doing Paris this year in
fact I'm doing Paris twice and going
going there once coming back and then
going back again so looking forward to
Paris actually so it's going to be a lot
of cool Fashion Week content coming up
very sweet to a big address and it has
these sweet little pockets in the side
as well
so I know I kept it secret but I am
going to New York with Victoria Beckham
Estee Lauder so I wanted to get
everything out and just look at
everything and decide what kind of looks
I want to be making it's insane
highlighter obviously the gloss which i
think is gonna be extremely extremely
popular this season is incredible so if
I could do a gloss you can put on one
front do you wanna mention there are the
new Armani excessive shine lipsticks
shows my favorite this one is in 100 but
look at the finish of these there are
also bit sheer with lovely pigmentation
and they just make the lips look really
lacquered and really shiny but not like
they don't stick there's no stickiness
like that
