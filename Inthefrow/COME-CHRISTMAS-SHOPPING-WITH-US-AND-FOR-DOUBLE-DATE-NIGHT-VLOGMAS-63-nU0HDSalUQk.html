this is how I start the day and well
good like this I actually did let me
look at my face
got a little parcel three mean Ikes is
my potential dress for the gleam party
which I think I'm gonna use cuz I love
it
it's very long I didn't expect it to be
on the floor which is always a little
bit annoying but I mean I can just kind
of hold it only one layer of lace I
suppose the actual dress is absolutely
gorgeous so nice I love it and then Alex
got a new t-shirt how great is this
coach t-shirts each other yeah it's
awesome quality isn't saying and even
like the white t-shirt quality of course
reason yeah nice that's so great if
you've not got this like now then that
would make such a good Christmas present
oh great what a great start to the day
hi guys it's actually six o'clock now
and I'm still in my dressing gown but I
do have a full face makeup on
yeah I just been feeling so low energy
so low motivation today totally just
uninterested feeling really low feeling
really really crappy about myself just
one of those days it's not a great day
but I did really want to film something
today and that is my a sauce party where
Hall which I like to do every year
pretty sure I did last year and after
the years before that that's for sure
let's say this is my bedroom right now
everything laid out I have 20 outfits
that I've bought I went through the
entire a SAS dresses collection to find
the ones I love the most
so that's 20 different dresses jumpsuits
trousers
so yeah it's six o'clock I really wanted
to film this but I've just felt
low-energy all day that I just didn't
want to do anything apart from bits on
my laptop and I decided that instead
Alex has gone to get some wine and
nibbles and we're gonna just film it for
the rest of the night and just get it
done so that we can get edited and
hopefully get it for some day by the
time that you see this hopefully I'll be
coming up or it's been up in which case
I'll leave it I never get the right
bloody way so it's merely a guys and I
think we're on outfit six that's like 80
I like face well I think I found like
one of my favorite so far
it's nicer than it babe this is maybe
the best one so far it fits so dice it's
it feels great not wearing a bra but it
feels really nice and fitted but yes

super nice I cannot wait to show you
