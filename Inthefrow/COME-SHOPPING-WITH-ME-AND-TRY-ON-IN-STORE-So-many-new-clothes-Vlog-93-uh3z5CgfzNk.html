vlog be like ever been out of the game
and not plugged in a couple of days it's
the most wonderful sunny bright week
here in London I'm just in the best mood
all the time at the moment today I'm
really excited because I get to go to
Nottingham to see my bestie go see and
staff in Nottingham the order of the day
though is I'm starting off with a
meeting I'm gonna go the gym and then
I'm gonna come home pack and then get to
the station for my little weekend away

along for the weekend away also I'm
really happy today because I'm wearing
some new shoes yesterday I wasn't also
vlogging yesterday but I had a little
bit of time to kill in the day and
decided I haven't been into Dior for a
while
so I wandered into D off a little peek
around and found some shoes absolutely
loved that thought be perfect for
spring/summer and especially with the
sunshine out I was really really
inspired just to get something new for
the like spring so these are my new
shoes
they are flats guys flats who even am i
but I thought I know how hot my feet get
when I'm in Boots in the sauna so these
are just the cutest little black flats
pointed toe which I loved I was looking
at loads of the different shoes he had
and a lot of them were round toe like
espadrilles and I wanted something that
was my usual style so these to me feel
like I'm wearing something really
sophisticated still but they're super
cool and they've got these gorgeous do
your straps in it's Mexican style print
and I really want the matching bag
wearing them today with my little red
pants the red chalice I love these who's
coming that mount for the day I'm going
just just loving white tees again right
