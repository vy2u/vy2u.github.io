nice
okay they're done and they're so perfect
okay guys back back from an awesome spin
class I had the best time last time I
went was good but I really really really
enjoy the time that you've sucked it was
Natalie at cycle and she was just so
like motivating and it was just yeah it
just felt like quite euphoric at times
not the kind of music she was using and
it was just like it was a really hard go
in there like I was literally sweat was
running off of me I'm looking forward to
shower just right in we've got the
American season 5 to start with and then
we're going to start watching for the
call sinners prime oh that's me Rebecca
said it's pretty good so that's what
we're gonna do that evening I hope
you're having a good evening too okay
guys so in bed I have washed my hair
hence why I look a little bit like a
poodle now we've settled our new Google
pixel book looking pretty cool gorgeous
little thing and this is the one that
says in the row in it I have oh god that
does whatever I've got a lemongrass and
ginger what they call fucka cheese
that's just too isn't it fuckity things
I mean I don't really usually you don't
drink to you having tea but I just not
been sleeping very well so I fancy time
with something quite nice and relaxing
so I'm gonna go give that a go update on
with skin it's still pretty bad I don't
know if you can really see it here on
the camera but the texture all over is
just under skin it's just not great but
my hair feels a lot better
I've used a lot of products on it
tonight to try and make it feel nice
again so I used a red Ken pH bandha
first of all which is like a pre shampoo
slathered that on for like 15 minutes
for treatment then use a red Ken
magnetics range I use the blue range
this time has not proteins and it just
to try and strengthen the hair again and
then I use the blue mega mask as well
and then after that I went back to my
trusty Moroccan oil for the ends because
I just don't think you can get any oil
that's more nourishing feelings than
that which I use the new pure ology
volumizing mousse then I just blow dried
it with my Dyson so time for bed now I
like for eating biscuits you're getting
crumbs all over the bed supper
yeah I can't good night sleep and a
fresh day tomorrow
good morning guys it
day wife's really bright
Thursday morning few things on the
Internet today for that photo say these
days I'm first of all heading into
Harvey Nicks because they have just
relaunched their Giorgio Armani Beauty
area inside of harping X so I'm going
over to the confession today I have a
little look around and see what I think
of it I'm pretty excited and also gonna
have some breakfast and a coffee okay a
little bit like ten minutes late so I'm
here I'm people booking hotels in all
morning for this Vegas trip and going on
next week so booked into the larger I'm
very excited but don't be anxious to
look good
yeah me okay yummy yummy breakfast John
now I'm gonna go check
let's go to Harry Harry it's a little
red box in the middle of Harvey Nichols
oh my favorite my favorite
please come and try this case it is just
heaven heaven okay guys so I'm gonna
excite now I mean you guys know how much
I love charm and beauty but having it
all out in front of you didn't I try out
my do a shade testing just to make sure
I'm definitely wearing them I shaved and
especially myself which every one of us
can do better so many things here that I
haven't seen before I haven't finished a
new jar and I want to show you quickly
so the thing is that's so nice about
this area is that you've got perfume
against makeup side by side this is
often happen very often us it's kind of
nice you can come on
choose your favorite perfumes it's also
than trying out those scarves and the
lipsticks and everything else you know
it's like my favorite mascara ever
eccentric oh we've got the new excessive
shines obviously here the very coolest
thing though is this lipstick number 103
in excess of shine so the only places
you can buy at this shade which by the
way is my new favorite lipstick shade
I'm going to swatch it here in a second
because it's absolutely amazing this can
only go on a half Enix site number 103
and also in store until they're sold out
so if you want the shade literally
you've got to get on it pretty soon
rose and nude pink it's got Tyler onyx
spheres in there so that it's really
lovely and QC and moisturizing like a
farm
it has Muscat rose oil for hydration and
moisturization it keeps it really
comfortable on the lips that sure you'd
like sex you can only get it here I will
or to down below we can get it from look
how amazing look at the shine that's
kind of like my usual nude a little bit
more pigs could it look quite as
lifeless they have also launched six new
lip magnet shades so this one especially
I have just fallen in love with you
5:08 I'm gonna quickly swatch it on my
hand so you can see it is so my kind of
color and I feel like I seen it
immediately a thesis she's going to go a
little bit sane so they have this
amazing piece of technology here where I
could literally be getting my makeup
done by one of the amazing makeup
artists on the counter and it would
record the whole thing so you can take
it home if he's not sure about how to do
your makeup in a certain kind of like
Armani way you can completely record it
take it home play it again the next day
and you can kind of like do it along
with it which is such a cute idea they
have this awesome I part where the idea
is you can either go for lip Magnus go
back to shine and then you can go a lot
and try on all the different shades
so you don't even need to put them on
your lips if you just try them on here I
don't know how they've calibrated this
so well it look works so amazing way you
can have your lipstick engraved which is
super special so I have gone for one of
the Rouge done Armani lipsticks hello
new nude shade this one is number 103
which I'm guessing is they're lighter
food and just quickly getting color
matched hardly miss filter because
everyone loves in the felt can I can
feel like I've never managed to find the
right shade because I always forget to
come to counter so quit calling Ashton
to check my perfect shade number four
yes
number number four so I really want to
try it but this is five away hey guys
back obviously obviously back from half
Enix just been working through the
afternoon I'm gonna be doing some
filming cuz I'm kind of in the mood to
do some filming so I've got my setup
going on I've got two videos on a film
sneaky peek so I'm just get myself ready
that's even more makeup on us really to
take it off I mean my skin it's feeling
so much better like the textures going
down a lot so I do want to take off soon
and keep it another break I think answer
disorder disordered from one of our
favorite Thai restaurants the delivery
so I got a little delivery room having a
math man Corey it's so delicious if I
wanted to go out and have like a little
date night and celebration night I guess
but um I got to busy sorry it is dead so
I gotta get me hunka half and half refit
my new vlog is about to go up so I need
to keep my eye on that as well mmm what
time is it
20 Boston I'm gonna take off his makeup
now put it put on quite a few different
layers I filmed three times actually
yeah I've just been filming I filmed two
videos tonight for kind of my Sunday
videos and I'm also just filmed a very
chatty talkie video just about the whole
like sexual assault experiences
conversation that's going on at the
moment on the news and social media and
all that I'm not sure when I'm gonna be
posting this but I'm gonna pull it title
at me to to go along with the whole
social media conversation just about my
experiences what I have experienced in
the past with sexual assault and those
horrific experiences so um I just wanted
to film it just to kind of form of it
bit of a discussion around and hopefully
help some of you guys if anyone's kind
of looking for someone to I don't know I
mean sometimes I write things on my blog
that I think just I am dealing with or I
just want to start to open up and talk
about it and then I'll be stunned by how
many comments I get from other people
experiencing the same things or they
felt something at some point and then I
realized just how many people can relate
to different things going on because
everyone has always got their own their
own issues that things going on so I
decided that there must be a lot of
people out there who maybe wanted to
hear a bit more of this conversation
especially from someone maybe that they
follow yeah so I've just done that so
just been filming that so now I'm just
gonna go take off all my makeup
