 super early hopefully no one
else is out there or will soon see it's
got a nice open about 9:30 morning
usually would be in bed so it's good
practice start to just look how
beautiful it is in here so pretty
there's been on our friend Kyle he's
come in had breakfast with us so it has
been taking our shot last year we came
in and cereal and we just took like one
Instagram shot I loved it so I figured
we'll come back and do prime a little
shoe in here so it'll be on the block
really soon and the infants around the
Instagram is for Google picks up and
working with those guys this year which
is super exciting that pixel to is
in saying I mean it's something a lot
different to iPhones everything so takes
a little bit getting used to but the
camera is amazing on that phone so we
always bring it with us I saw this
before it brings with us our our phone
we take shots um right but the Instagram
is for some events that I am hosting in
Manchester confirming it so exciting so
I think I can tell you about this now Oh
Friday 19 I'm gonna be in Birmingham at
7 p.m. in turn that have got a super
special event and I can't say where yes
just feel like a security purposes well
pretty much like to have loads of you
guys and plus one so you can perman
friend or boyfriend or husband or wife
for the night the canapes cocktails
gonna get goodie bags you're gonna get
money off the new Google pixel to whom
they're gonna get a key honestly it's
gonna be such an it's a no I want to get
photos with everyone I want to chat with
everyone gets you know you all so it's
Friday 19th in the evening at Bergen
Street like a proper like 905 and then
on Saturday 20th of June it'll be in
Manchester again it's super gorgeous
like cocktail bar 7:00 to 11:00 again
like meet and greet chat you'll get this
goodie bag you can take some cocktails
and champagne and everything and it's
just a big like Google pixel event
hosted by me so exciting so yeah I'll
leave all of you tails down below now
we're doing some shopping or what do we
like with judicata so I'm going twice
and normally I need some are warm
jackets this is so adorable it's like 65
quid it's super fluffy I really actually
really like it kyle is also a winner
it's been okay from a self district and
it's not I'd show you the few bits that
I got a little little Selfridges haul
kind of unintentionally actually but I
thought when this trip coming up I
didn't want to get a few new things to
show my Instagram and I'm blog posts and
it's kind of reboot my wardrobe for
January first thing that I got that
absolutely obsessed with you might see
no signs of stories is this Baker boy
hat I've never owned a hat like this and
I honestly never ever thought that I
would I thought I would look a bit
ridiculous I mean you'll have to see for
yourself what you actually think of me
in this book I put it on really really
like I didn't think I could pull off a
hot light I think it looks better with
my hands a bit bigger but what do you
think I think that's super cool it was
14 pounds I think it's just really
really cool for any outfit but I really
liked it wear it so I got this comb I
couldn't not so got this in the 6 I was
gonna go for the aches out like quite
like the oversize fit of it but I just
thought this was one of those gorgeous
super gorgeous coats if I didn't buy now
it would sell out and then I'd be a bit
got it I mean baby pink isn't using my
style with having such white blonde hair
it's easy to get typecast and I mean it
I often see Barbie comments on my
Instagram not necessarily in an
insulting way and I actually don't even
see it as an insult whatsoever so
honestly it doesn't bother me for no
never just call me Barbie but at the
same time I like pink so I'm just trying
to think of how a stylist may be with
kela jump even jump like this underneath
it and then some maybe even jeans or
dark jeans to match the Hat so thick so
those are the two things that I've
bought first of all this jacket was 65
pounds the next thing that you saw that
I picked up in the store so this is a
jumper I mean it's very woolly knitted I
think it must be a bit mohair because
it's very fluffy and it's got lots of
fluffy bits this with leather trousers
and black boots again it could me of me
it could to speak black boots could look
awesome or red boots this one like a
black skirt or a denim skirt with black
or red over knee boots could look kind
of quite powerful quite cool and again
even with this hat you know this kind of
vibe and thought I'll get it for now see
if I can style it up for Iceland if not
I can always take it back and return it
if it's not quite right for me but I
thought I saw some really lovely
peaceful it's not too thick but you
could layer it and the last piece I can
furnish your show on camera is an
incredible jacket I think you guys are
gonna absolutely love this this was 200
pound but honestly I feel like it looks
like when I went to look at the tag I
thought this would maybe be 800 odd
pound plus but this is all like a
obvious if so shilling look at this I
don't know if you can see on camera just
how gorgeously blue it's almost like a
deep indigo navy blue lovely mix and
it's just got a shilling section all the
way down the sleeves and I love the way
it's kind of taped here so it tapers in
here and then the same here so it does
kind of mix this up shilling all across
the back shoulder panel hope you can see
that the way it's catching a light I get
the feeling this is gonna be like the
big piece of a season from this brand as
well cos I just think people are gonna
go crazy for this I've not seen like a
shilling style jacket like this with all
these panels of shilling mixed over
cheap skin and at this price range as
well like I think this is gonna fly off
it's 200 pound like I said I honestly
though it's gonna be a good 800 pound
850 when I went to see the label so like
drying this but I thought it could look
really cool against my trip and again
perfect with the blue hair
works quite nicely so that's my little
mini haul from today I'm an expert to
buy anything so I'm quite pleased to get
actually some bits
alex has gone further than that I think
what I might do now is well first I'm
gonna review the photos that we took
earlier in the cafe I might also start
packing this off for Iceland so I've got
an idea of what outfits I've got I'm
gonna put together on what days yeah and
then later I mean I don't want to go to
gym I like this I'm really feeling it so
I might just do a little at-home ab
workout I think just in the front view
yes the order of the day oh oh oh oh I
think I'm gonna go take off my makeup
because all this area is so dry it's so
sore
I'm gonna go take off the neck of the
thing and chill a bit and I do want to
do an ab routine that's one thing I
definitely want to do she says after
eating a packet of pop chips and half of
this chocolate this vegan chocolate bar
I'm gonna go do that now so I took off
my makeup feeling much much better
although it's still super tight but it's
moisturizing to the knives only I'm
gonna have a bath now I've had a really
productive few hours it's about 10
o'clock now Saturday night but a really
productive few hours of going through
old videos gonna come up with ideas for
new videos to film 2018 just to kind of
get back on track with ideas and the way
I'm going to hit the channel and
everything else okay and when you use
this I've just found this sea salt buff
melt from Miss patisserie thing look how
adorable is this it's vegan as well
isn't it natural little cupcake mint
take off the flowers and take off the
casing and then just throw it into the
bath and it's got like shea butter in it
and coconut oils and really nice things
I think so excited let's see how this
goes
that was majorly underwhelming muezzins
crumbling instead golf now I'm just
gonna leave it hope the best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
