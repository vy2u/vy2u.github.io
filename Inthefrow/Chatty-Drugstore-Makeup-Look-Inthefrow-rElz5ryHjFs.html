today I wanted to do a drugstore makeup
routine because I don't think I've ever
really done a drugstore make it routine
before which is crazy
so I've dived into all of my different
drawers and shells and found all my
favorite kind of drugstore products and
just kind of put something together for
you it just sort of on the spot what do
I fancy doing so it turned out to be
sort of a copper bronze II lid with a
lovely bright almost Coralie red lip
really really hope you like this look if
you do then please keep watching just
applied some of the drops of youth serum
from my shop it's a really good serum
and much more inexpensive than some of
the other high-end brands that I do like
to use button just as good really I've
also applied from the regen cream
because it's just won the best drugstore
high street drugstore moisturizers on I
see now it's all of this stuff I mean
it's like three or four pound yet from
home bargains from out there from Amazon
it's a super affordable so I've got
those and then going to apply the
L'Oreal True Match this is in the shade
n2 from nail and I'm going to use that
on my zoeva silk finish brush I think it
might be a little bit too dark I'm also
going to a really bad skin time at the
moment which is quite strange for me cuz
I used to have quite my skin is usually
okay
with me I'm not used to that spot prone
and everything else but I'm just having
a bit of an issue I use some old skin
care I think I think it's an old little
product I've had for a while and I've
put some of that on and then the next
day all this sign my face came out he
might so go to see it it's almost like
strange bubbly text yeah I love my skin
saucy you can imagine I had a bit of a
freak out about that
okay so just buff that in all over my
face it's actually a really love occult
coverage The True Match really nice
quite really nice shade actually it's a
little bit too dark because I haven't
tanned in a while I must have met
drugstore concealer I'll go with the
eraser i from this Maybelline Maybelline
eraser i I've got the cool light
sure you've seen this before it's a
really good little product especially
this like foam bomb top it just really
helps to blend everything quite well and
it's really nice I'm gonna use my Real
Techniques sponge one of the best things
ever and I would use my vitamin E face
myths which I use on everything and
Louis we're always like what you use it
just left
target left it's running out otherwise
what are you some films okay we'll go
with this then we're gonna make you to
blend a nice and jump this is literally
the best tool if you haven't invested in
this yet you really really should it's
so good oh I'm gonna powder now my issue
is I don't have any low-end powder took
so powder but if I did I would have the
Rimmel stay matte powder in translucent
that's what I'd use so we mentioned I'm
using that now I've only recently thrown
one of those out because I used it all
so I'm lacking for that but let's just
pretend that that is what I'm using and
I'm using it with the Real Techniques
brush would you a further face brush
this is in the next pick set I love this
brush for powder just dispenses a
product so lightly and almost sits out
everything and let me leave a little bit
on your face I put on a bit at the Blitz
tax happy lips this is a strawberry
flavor and it's really nice my lips are
just so bad at them and my face feeling
really so it's just really not gonna use
the super glory it's so a powder I'm
just gonna try and even out this color
now
through the really got brothers right
now it's a big favorite rule lot of
people special a lot of bloggers and
youtubers it's really floorball and I'm
such a lovely color to use more though
oh this is one of Romney Real Techniques
brushes by the way this is a 301 contour
brush beautiful and I'm a little bit
about under there it's a really kind of
tightly packed day so you really need a
little bit it just helps to really
chisel that out
I think I'm going to use this body shop
in the shade ginger all-in-one cheek
color and I'm going to use that the most
beautiful brush this is the 300 brush
from real that makes our new bold metals
collection and a little bit of that onto
this this is such a pretty brush
I mean it pretty shade of all the shade
I'm gonna use that dual fire brush just
to blend a bit about em together the
best thing I've ever used with brows and
low in Category is this from beauty UK
it's got four different colours he got
black light brown dark brown and a wax I
would always recommend that again and
really good brush I think the better you
brushes for eyebrows the easier it is
that always recommend that just get a
bit a little bit of Wax
look at the brow of the dog you know
male light matte dark brown eyebrows
I mean so eyebrows or no really about
today I don't know what it's going on
with these
okay so my favorite brow gel is the
butter sharp eyebrow gel it's so good
can't find it I don't know where that is
now it's gone so I'm gonna use the HD
brows brow beat it does exactly the same
thing but this is more this is more
money but if I would if I did have it
I'd be using the bodyshop eyebrow gel
right now we're just finishing off with
a gel helps keep it in place removes any
excess product that might be able making
them look a little bit strange and it
helps to keep them in place it's gonna
add a little bit of highlighter as well
I'm gonna use the body sharp radiant
highlighter this is such a pretty color
and I've actually never used this I'm
good to go in fact I've never used it it
even got the tag keeping it together so
I'm gonna use my resonates at buffing
brush to get a little bit of that I'm
just
this brush is gorgeous this is the 200
from the bold metals collection really
large eyeshadow brush it's really pretty
I think I might use this such thing then
you see shimmer cues from the body shop
I've got rich espresso burnished gold
dusty thorn and warm copper inside it
he's got the some pretty nice shakes and
then try these when I go in with this
first one I'm a beautiful new brush and
then is to help me out
the really pretty shimmer
it's not between a corner
I'm going to take the 201 from the bulb
my elf I'm going to go with this one I
think this might be the burnished copper
shade really pretty it's a little lovely
thought of a transitional pre-show you
just I'm gonna go with this I just will
run that into the crease
I'm just going to take the bold metals
202 liner brush and use a bit more of
that burnished copper just a line and
here
so pretty a little bit more of that
thoughtful lemon gold just break up the
two shades
I really like it happy that Mike deep
burnished gold underneath the eye it's
really pretty
as we use all the colors in the palette
so I'm just gonna go with this sort of
dark rum darker gold I'm gonna take that
on another brush for the Real Techniques
brush again and just use a little bit of
that and I'm all it's just gonna put
that into this edge just as more of a
transition shade between burnished
copper and the lemon gold it's a little
bit more Sparkle you could I feel like
you've got all the colors oh why not
just throw them all on there I'm going
to use the darker shade in that palette
which is like a dark like a bronze shade
and with a wet brush just to pick up
loads of product I'm gonna use that now
to line my eyes so really pushing it
into the lash line
she was so much easier when the products
wet
oh and the brushes were even better
really quite pretty and I'm all that's
left to do is lips and mascara I'm gonna
use a Schumer and killers but I also
recommend boots do ones that say read on
the back like engraved get also really
really good but I need to kill mashes
I'd say for everyone even if you have
killer ashes are not just getting a
little bit ok I'm gonna use the L'Oreal
Paris fault slash telescopic and I'm
gonna use that on my lower lash it the
phone they're really good for lower
lashes I would do i I'll give this a go
I'll give this a go on my flashes and
let's see what happens last time you
said I was not here you all see
hmm quite pretty actually it definitely
does lengthen and separate some really
nicely I think it's just for me I just
like a kill but no mascara it's not
waterproof we're going to keep that
going for me finish off with some lips
and I don't know I think I might go with
a red yeah good for a red I'm gonna go
for top shots hazard brand-new I've
never used this I thought it's quite a
lovely red I'm gonna take a lip brush
with there such the second so I get a
line on the go Oh
Soph it on okay so let's go for a line
okay now I'm gonna learn let's go fill
that in with the bullet solver cherry
red though ruin like that I'm just gonna
finish it off with a glass I want to
finish off my lime crime valve teens
lipstick in suede Barry this is such a
pretty not like a coral color go really
nice with sort of burnt orange shades
I've got going on
I'm just gonna add a little bit more
blush same again I shop ginger
and then we have it full drugstore
makeup look I can't believe I'm not
really ever done one of these before and
I do have so many amazing products in
the drugstore that just don't really
dabble with and I should do and this is
teaching me that I should definitely try
and find them take Matt my drawers and
