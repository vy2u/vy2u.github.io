festive Christmas Eve video it's nearly
Christmas we are in the month of
December now and Christmas is dawning
upon us so it's about time that I
decorated the tree I mean I let's get a
bit more festive and in the mood for the
Christmas holidays I went shopping for
Christmas decorations
this is Manny Alex's first place
together so I wanted to make it super
special and for us to have a really
lovely Christmas this year seeing as
we're together for the first time
properly this year so I went all out and
I got all new decorations a brand new
tree and the kind of things that kind of
investments because I know from my
parents they've had decorations for
years and years and years they're the
kind of things that you can kind of buy
once and although they might be a bit
expensive down down the line you'll use
them every single year so it's always
good to buy really amazing ones that you
think that you'll never get bored of and
that you'll love forever the other week
I was shopping around Selfridges and I
went into their fourth floor in London
store which is their Christmas area and
it's absolutely gorgeous and I was
totally inspired and I was like yep this
is where I want to get my Christmas
decorations from because everything is
so beautiful I've had two big deliveries
from Selfridges I'm going to unbox them
for you before you wonder no this video
is not sponsored by Selfridges it's just
my favorite store the main point of this
is just if you see a bob or that you
like or sand light so you like maybe
it's inspiration or maybe it's
inspiration if you go to another garden
center and you see something similar and
I want to get something really similar
to that that's the main point of this
inspiration I'm not telling you to go
out to Selfridges and buy all of your
decorations from Selfridges I know some
people will think that that's not what
I'm saying
anyway let's get into it the main event
I decided this year to go for something
a little different than I ever have
before and I've gone for a white
Christmas shipping so I got this one
setting it's 2 meters tall so it should
be nice size and it's quite thin tree as
well
quite different a bit unusual in the
green but green 360 is a thought this
year and try white
it's the legs some lights
I got 118 multi fact warm white LED
light because I hopefully these have a
few different ways that you can use them
I quite like that when you do the big
the ones when it comes fade in and out
you'll see these are nomer like
seventeen point nine meters in length
Wow that's long that's the lot of lights
okay hooks leatherby okay just in case I
need a bit more color on the tree or
forward it's gotta be a little bit bland
I also got some red lights so these look
like cherry red lights I thought it
would look quite pretty wrapped around
the tree and in there that that's ten
meters no now put nine meters with eight
functions so they should be quite pretty
it's come in a fragile box Oh glass
icicles oh my goodness these are so
gorgeous
I could actually cry that's the looks
like festive no even that bird icicles
how pretty they can you just see how
pretty they is so pretty okay next up I
got this cute little teddy bear in white
a little pink bow around its neck I
thought it was really really cute what a
cutie pie my favorite this is almost
like it's a bronze rose gold bauble and
it almost looks a bit like an acorn
before you start to wonder what my theme
is I went for white silver and with a
touch of bronze and rose gold in there I
ordered a stocking because I wanted to
put it up somewhere and maybe to put
some little presents in it for me and
now it just a really lovely 3d glittery
star
okay so delicate beautiful and it
realized it was so big I'm so glad it is
clever potentially put it on the very
top of the tree
that's a lovely
at all metalwork snowflake star with
little gems inside I think I'm really
going to put luggage up my tree because
I forgot to buy a chopper so that would
be perfect
how gorgeous is this this is like a goal
very light white gold and silver diet
one officer diamonds but diamond style
things in the middle
I got a scented candle from white
company just to put inside a candle
holder which should be coming soon
oh I bots with Chevron paper straws
because I love having straws in the
house I prefer drinking my cheeks hot
straw soaked up some milos and also
we're having a New Year's Eve pilot ok
youtubers New Year's Eve party
I thought these big cake for that big
black and most like glass style but
white in there I mean I was gonna go for
black white silver tones I got us a link
absolute calendar to share it's my
favorite I love milk chocolate I
actually don't remember ordering this
but I quite like it this way around Sumi
actually really liked it it's paper fan
you can hang that up I love things like
this so I have to go for it and it was
also a little bit more rose gold I like
the idea of goes from or for audience
beams so I've got these little hearts
that dangling from this ropes
thought this was adorable and it's just
a little tiny for the tree I
definitely bought too many too many
lights but these can we completely put
these up in the lounge just in the
lounge somewhere and they're just star
shaped lights this turn
oh they're sweet so quite nice signs of
star to star lights they will be really
oh I love this when I saw it this is a
sounds like a tea light holders you can
put tea lights underneath it and I'll
say it alight outside of this it's got
the star on the top this goes over there
I wonder if there's a bottom I thought
there should have been a button to it
that's gospel bass - I went for four
silver Bob also silver mirrored ball
balls
I think the mirrored style is very very
Christmasy I see people taking pictures
in them but they'd be quite sweet oh how
cute
this is like a huge glass ball with
little white spots and inside are
feathers that are almost in paper like
paper feathers and this is a wall string
that's so unique and totally totally
different how pretty I love how big some
these bulbs are so when you buy online
up and show how big the baubles are
gonna be or how they're gonna fit so
quite a few of these are bigger than I
anticipated which I quite like that
white glittery it's almost looks pink
and some lights well say I always say
little for anyone who hates that I hate
it too when I'm editing out go little
that's a lovely little lovely little it
drives me insane - I'll try not to
I'll try to edit all those out so this
is a large ball ball in glitter these
are some of my favorites actually this
one is just a glass the glass heart on a
string this is a rose gold
trapeze shape pyramid I mean these are a
little more expensive because they're
obviously a metal no a bit unique a bit
alternative but I love the colors and I
don't think any Christmas tree is
complete without a large snowflake yeah
and this one has the silver gem in the
middle gorgeous wow this is a Silver
Star and it's almost got exploding
pieces coming out of it and diamond
diamonds and on the side all these are
very delicate go for a very similar
theme here very delicate pieces this
cells really excited about - this is a
large rose gold candle holder again this
really odd through it matches it's the
same brand of this is here that's so
gorgeous this is a white large bubble
with silver glitter that's been spiraled
around each side so much to the white
one this one is a silver bear I couldn't
have a guy a girl with our little guy
mmm - I bought this star holder to put
in the little tea light in as a little
accessory around the room for decoration
it sounds like a frosted glass almost
looks like it's been blasted with snow
around the outside it's got this gold
seeing there's also white heart which is
in a must be like a metal I like my
hearts and stuff but these from these
are from the white company at Selfridges
and it's three glass baubles with white
silver glitter that's been wrapped
around and they're all slightly
different shades this one's got the
point to the bottom and then this one is
a longer
and it's a little Robin Robin are a door
for anything peaceful again this is
almost sykes glass it's been blasted
with gold oh I've got I also bought some
wrapping paper that says joy all over it
in white with green and red I think
that's everything in my Christmas
decorations Hall this is so fun to film
I've never felt anything like this
