festive video I've been excited about
filming us now for quite some time and I
felt it was about time that I got to it
so this is going to be my women's
Christmas gift guide video I will be
filming my men's Christmas gift guide
video in a few more days so that will be
up really really soon but for now this
video is going to be focusing on art at
the ladies so the mums daughters sisters
wives girlfriends Nana's and teams with
lots of Christmas present inspiration I
have a lot here to show you as potential
ideas just to note here everything i've
chosen for this gift guide I've selected
myself chosen because I would personally
love it and think it will work for lots
of different people so I don't want to
bore you on each and every present by
saying I love this because of this I
love this because of this just know that
I love everything here and these are
just potential ideas I'm going to start
this off with makeup and for me
personally I think that makeup palettes
are the best way to go if you're wanting
to gift makeup so I've got a few pallets
here that I think might work the new
NARS
Steven Klein this is the one shocking
moment palette and it's absolutely
incredible for blushes bronzer a contour
and highlight I think so many women
would love that for eyes the new Urban
Decay Gwen Stefani collaboration palette
which hold 15 lovely eyeshadow shades
some a map and some a very shimmery
glittery pigmented shadows
so that's beautiful there's also the new
Lancome audacity in Paris palette which
holds 16 different eyeshadows across
here here and then this is a brush so
that was really gorgeous and I'd say
this one would work really well for
auntie's mom's Nana's who are into
makeup the March or later who might love
come this is a really lovely palette
from / i think ur face it called love
your selfie and this opens up and inside
it has two lip glosses it's got a
bronzer or blush and illuminating
highlighting powder and then here you've
got four eight four really lovely
eyeshadows as well and it comes in this
great little box so that's quite a good
one soft carry around i say this would
be great for sort of young ladies
someone that's really just starting to
get into makeup and wants lots of
different products in one but they're a
really good quality and then one of my
favorites is a brand new Christmas
chanel edition eye shadows and this is
called scene particular but I just
thought at all absolutely stunning this
palette you've got a really bright gold
a deep purple a taupe gray and also a
shimmery pink champagne almost and I've
worn this recently I'm gonna be doing a
blog post about these and me trying
these armed for more information on them
but I just thought the amount of women
that would just love to open up a little
Chanel palette and see that really
wanted to mention as well the most
gorgeous makeup case if you're looking
to give someone a makeup case this year
these are absolutely beautiful they're
made by Max London of course I'll leave
a link down below for everything here so
the link for this will be down below and
my very good friend Hannah Max makes
these and it's absolutely stunning it
opens up and it's a lovely brush holder
so you can put all your brushes into
little sections here it's kind of thing
that you kind of open up and you could
put all your makeup on top of it while
you doing your makeup if you're out
traveling and then you can tie it
together and you've got a lovely little
makeup brush travel kit there is also
the new Christmas collections from Laura
Messier I'm a big fan of Laura Mercier I
wanted to mention these first of all the
kiss of color lip gloss collection think
there are one two three four five
different little lip glosses in here
from red through pinks into nude
it doesn't have something very retro
about this golden brown almost animal
print style but still a real lovely gift
idea this is the glam to go cheek and
travel kit so it opens up like this it
got a little lip gloss in this side and
you can open this door here and then
there you've got a blush a bronzer and
four-place shadow shades I mean that's
so nice and it's also got massive mirror
here as well but so you've got your own
shadows blush bronzer and a lip gloss in
a really handy little chocolate I think
that'll be so popular for Christmas
comes not love a look it in skincare
ideas I really wanted to mention the new
Clarisonic and Keith Haring edition me a
to device and you may be quite we're
already of the Clarisonic I real of mine
I policeman what's or twice a week in
between using all the devices as well
and I really love it for really great
cleanse it reads remove all dirt from
the face mines of town which is good now
from all my makeup but it's just a
lovely cleansing brush one of Keith
Haring's quite famous illustrations on
the back of the device of waterproof
canvas bag as well which hasn't cleanser
in it on the whole bus and body kits
idea as well just another piece from
Laura Mercier in their collection this
year I love this and this one got me
this I would literally squeal with
delight it is the bath and body set in
ombre vanilla and I love this this is
probably my favorite Laura Mercier scent
collection that they do and in here you
get the cream body wash the honey bath
the souffle body cream and the I'm
guessing that sort of a body spray and
you also get the little honey dip to go
inside the holy bath they smell gorgeous
they last for ages as well and it's just
the most beautiful kit that'll be really
really
think as a Christmas gift think one
brand that you can't go wrong with four
women for Christmas is definitely Jo
Malone they do so many incredible
fragrances I really love pomegranate
Noir
I love the wood and sea salt wood sage
and sea salt as well I love that one in
here I have the most second cardamom
clone but as well if you live anywhere
near London at the moment you can get
different colored tops for these but
there are so many types I definitely
recommend you go along and in fact they
just wrap them so gorgeous it just says
gift all over it also this is beautiful
at the moment the Regent Street store
which is a flagship of Jo Malone they
have an in-house illustrator so if you
buy anything you can have your boxes
Illustrated in store so this one has an
incredible Regent Street illustration
I'm here for me but then inside is one
of my favorites the pomegranate in Hwa
candle and again I mean look how
beautiful that is as a gift you can't
really go wrong with that related it
smells so beautiful this it's just like
you might imagine pomegranate juice but
really rich and really really dark but
it's what you get for this you always
get the germ alone matches as well I
also wanted to mention these as I get
these most years now because it is super
fun the the Clarins Christmas crackers
so inside each one of these are six in
here and inside each one it's a little
miniature clarence product and I love
taking these to my girls Christmas with
my girls every year we always have a
Christmas meal a few days before
Christmas and I always take a box of
these along since usually six of us take
one of these along and we all pull them
and we all go away the little tiny
miniature Clarence product so in here
we've got a gentle refiner eg flashbang
on a nail treatment
Odie's yaadein so I'm guessing that's
like a small 30 mil spray I think
there's a lipstick and this also little
mini mascara so how cute is that
another cute little gift would be this
remark Brown this is the molten Brown
woman's travel luxury set and it's
called London via the world apparently
then here it's the ginger lily body wash
body polisher body lotion shampoo and
also hand cream on the gingerly scent I
think this would also work really well
for men as well if you get it in the
men's sense
speaking of Martin Brown they also do
these Christmas baubles and inside of
here is bath and shower gel how lovely
is that and then this one is honeysuckle
and white tea bath and shower gel so
lots of different scents and flavors you
can get but how beautiful are they
though so you can hang those nutri and
then when you want to use them just like
this how cute is that another of my
favorite types of candle so I love Joe
Malone and I also love neon and this is
the instantly de-stress gift collection
and then inside of here you get a little
love and adjustment Brazilian and
rosewood candle which is beautiful
a bath and shower oil a distress on the
go myth so it's all just about
distressing and cheer now and you also
get twenty pounds fast shooting pouches
in the arms as well but for neon if you
didn't want to buy the kit and you're
interested more in the candles the
candles are just gorgeous that's so
lovely wow it's so Christmassy it's just
like Christmas night with cinnamon and
nutmeg and a bit of orange and kind of
cedar wood and boys licious is so nice
and because I'm a massive fan of LMS as
well I want to include them and this is
their new beginnings kit which comes in
this box and when you open it up it has
a pro collagen marine cream which I
adore it's got the pro-collagen eye
renewal anti aging and it's also got
some hydrogel I'm asks the seem to be
upside down some reason it should be
more like this but I don't think you can
go wrong with LMS for auntie's mom's
Nana's or for younger girls who just
really love this
I mean I adore LMS so so much so I think
this off thought it was a really really
great kind of gift idea and the fact
they come in these lovely boxes I think
afterwards you can kind of pull out the
packaging and keep it as a nice box to
store all of your LMS goodies as well
another scent I would recommend though
is definitely the my Burberry and this
is the beautiful Christmas edition
bottle that has the almost a snow globe
effect I've already mentioned this
already the favorites but I love the
scent now is kind of my scent to go to
at the moment but the Christmasy edition
bottle is absolutely stunning you'll
have also seen this in my baby video if
you've not seen that already please go
and watch it really enjoy putting that
together and Alex filmed it for me and
it made it beautiful and you can see
lots of shots of this gorgeous perfume
but it's just it's so stunning and I
think it would it transcends through so
many different generations that would
wear this scent is beautiful we've
talked a lot there about beauty makeup
and skincare and everything else beauty
and I just got a few of the bits as well
as ideas the brand new Jamie Oliver
cookbook
I love getting Jamie Oliver cookbooks
each year my mom usually buys a tan in
fact I picked this up we've heard of the
day when we were shopping I went back to
visit my mom and I saw her it was like
all because this is a super food book so
this is all kind of Jamie's meals that
are really really healthy and much
better for you so straightaway I was
totally pulled into this and my mum said
oh I'll get it for you for Christmas
and I was like never have to just really
want it now so I can start cooking with
this even in time for Christmas Jamie is
very very well loved anyway and as this
being more of a super food book it's
great around Christmas as people are
thinking what can I do to kind of carve
the Christmas way superfood recipe book
this is one for mothers watching or
boyfriends watching who want to buy
something for their girlfriend or
husband for their wife or mother
for their daughter who lost Burberry
this is obviously a much more expensive
gift but it's a gift idea nonetheless
and I think that I would have absolutely
loved to get this as a Christmas gift
but I think that this with the
monogramming so IV CM as
my initials so you can get the
monogrammed in the store Regent Street
store in London that's where this was
done and there's a lot of different
types of course to choose from they
don't have to have jack on them there's
lots they're just plain colors and you
get it monogrammed and they have the
Burberry logo on there as well but I
just think the way you've come and the
sort of a wrapped up kind of like in a
little tube and they come inside a
beautiful white shoe with wrapping on
there and it's just so special it's it's
a big Christmas tree by decide mention
it for any camera enthusiasts the
Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 so many people
have been absolutely loving these
recently I'm really so the are really
fun grateful if you're having my parties
or health parties or all the families
come around I mean these are great even
just from Christmas Day so if you got
this for someone on Christmas Day it's
great for taking pictures of their
family all around the tree and
everything a Christmas Day and that's
what I used to do so that's what I did
and if not if you have anyone in your
family who's a budding blogger or
someone who loves to take photographs I
could not recommend my camera more
honestly the olympus pen ep-1 7 i have
it with the 45 millimeter lens because
it's amazing for taking fashion
photography because the depth of field
that below in the background is
beautiful and I up until January so all
the way through Christmas I have a 25%
off discount code for this camera which
makes it cheaper than anywhere else you
will ever get it so I'll leave all the
details down below for that how you can
get this but if you were looking to get
someone a camera or even for yourself if
you want to treat yourself to a camera
or if you're watching this and you're
thinking getting a camera off your daddy
your mom or someone send them to this
video show them discount code and it
will greatly help them I'm sure 25% it's
a lot of money off a camera that's 400
pounds for a small little treat you
notebooks I mean lots of women like
stationary and things like that and I
have so many here that I thought show
you these are from oh dear
Oh bugs I think it is three-in-one there
these are also rather cool they've just
got a really kind of scenic or quite
dial-up print on the very front this one
says die bin it's got a jellyfish on
there and this one has a waterfall
almost successful finality symmetry and
it says go explore and if not I love the
designs of the scale system Niki strange
I also have her phone case so this is a
phone case by Nicky strange again I
would recommend this as a great stocking
filler or little present for someone I'm
in love with this I've had so many
compliments on it but she also does note
paps again beautiful design it smells
mean a small one like handbag size and
you know I think that might be
everything but I have also written a
blog post recently and it had so many
Black Friday sales ideas cyber monday
sales ideas but I put so many pieces in
there that were pieces I personally
really want so again I will link that
blog post down below and have a look
through there because there's so many
other pieces that I just personally
don't have on me right now that I would
highly recommend this gift ideas hats
accessories bags or shoes clothing
that's home where pieces there's so much
so I will leave a link down below to
that so go have a look at that as well
with loads more ideas overall I really
hope this has been a helpful video I've
really enjoyed sort of collecting all
these bits together and I'm hoping none
of my family have watched this because
these are all of their presents I have
told them strictly not to watch this
video so if and if you're watching then
shame on you you're not going to get any
presents this year I am joking of course
you will but hopefully they won't know
which will be there good luck with your
Christmas shopping I won't say happy
Christmas yet because you'll see me a
lot more before Christmas but enjoy that
and I will see you really really soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
