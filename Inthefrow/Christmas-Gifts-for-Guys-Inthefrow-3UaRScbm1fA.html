Christmas gift card video you may have
already seen my lazy cousins gift guide
which I filmed a few days ago except my
last video if you want to watch that but
this time we're gonna be focusing on the
guys in our lives boyfriends brothers
sons fathers granddad's
and calls so as I did in the latest
Christmas gift guide I'm going to start
off this gift guide with beauty products
so male Beauty you want to start off
with a cologne or Eau de Toilette
so first up Chanel and the hot sport I
also really like the just a general
alone it's a little bit more mature not
obviously not quite sporty if this one
is a little bit more fresh and a bit
more for younger fragrance wear so at
the Aloha it's all it's a lot more it's
more mature masculine sort of older man
but really lovely sexy smell I've also
got spice bomb from Victor roll I'm a
huge fan of Victor off as you probably
know and spice bomb is no different it's
actually gorgeous it's got that more
spicy manly smell but still really
distinctive and stunning so I think Alex
are probably I love this one I've also
gone for the Burberry Brit splash as
well which is a stunning fragrance like
we all kind of have that sort of almost
sporty quite manly sexy young you know
the kind of smell that you want your
boyfriend to smell like really so these
three especially I think our winners
another scent as well is the dolce
gabbana intense sow and this comes in
this great gift set so if you first give
gift sets rather than single which while
that starts I'll be right over the
off-street inside it's all really nicely
wrapped with dolce gabbana Peter and
then inside this is what you get at
least two so you get a dog showing about
a poor home or de-puff on and you get to
the aftershave balm I think this is
going to be one that's my Concord thank
you all this couple more sets I've
gotten Beauty are from Ted Baker first
off with this one's for miniatures
insider
our two body sprays and to hair and body
washes both in two different so this
one's a cool classic said to think and
this one is a sporty fresh scent I
thought that was a great kit I think
this might want for the father and this
one is great for the guy let's travel
and it's always on the go and it's in
need of a wash bag so it's got a handle
as well it's quite cool and then sorry
did you get a hair and body wash that
you find an invigorating scent and you
also get the body spray to match and
that comes inside the case I'm short
pull up it look quite a waterproof style
leather material but again I saw that
traveling you need a small wash bag this
is adorable you probably know Sammy
smells the Maria on YouTube formerly
known as beauty crush her and her
partner Jason have created their own
line products called November at night
and I love them I've recently modeled
for some of their things as well and
they stock this little leather bag
inside it's got this great tartan print
and I thought for a guy going away you
can fit your shaver in there confess
smell deodorant you can see toothbrush
this would be really good actually for
guys or girl also kind of throw in their
backpacks or their handbags and I last
thing in beauty is this from lush lush
do so many cool products and they also
do some great products for guys Alex
absolutely loves this so I'm sure I'll
be getting him another one of these it's
the R&amp;amp;B hair moisturizer it smells so
lovely for a start it's got a great
scent to it but he uses this on his
beard so for any girls out there or
mothers who have sons or boyfriends or
husbands you have beards and they want
to make it a bit more stuff don't put
something in it this smells so good it's
never out so sonic eyes face I can't
help but kind of like go near his face
and like like look you smell so good
next up I'm gonna go for alcohol it's an
easy choice uh he's already got into
this bottle but I wanted to mention it
anyway because I buy Alex a bottle of
bourbon every year but it's his favorite
drink
there are also guys out there that love
whiskey or wine or vodka so I think it's
always an easy way especially for mums
to get for their sons just a really cool
more special bottle of something now I'm
gonna move into the thing that Alex just
the most which is play on his xbox I
thought I would mention a few things
that are potentially great gift ideas
for this Christmas
first off being halo halo 5 so I lost
Alex to this for a couple of weeks next
up is fallout 4 which I've currently
lost him to so both - I couldn't list
some of the best in the charts for Xbox
the more social player this is what you
wanna be getting Guitar Hero live this
is so much fun I'll be honest with you
it's already opened it to play here
because I wanted to get this for Alex
for Christmas but I also wanted to get
me it for Christmas so yeah we've
already got this out but it is so much
fun a massive fan of the last Guitar
Hero games I was so good I was so good
at it so much so that Alex really hated
playing it with me see I always beat Tim
and isn't like tuna loose but guitar
here alive is so much more it's so much
harder to play so this is the guitar
that you get and whereas before how it
was just 1 2 3 4 5 buttons and you sort
of play along it this now has two on
each fret so it's six buttons but three
here three here so you've got to learn
how to sort of use both sides and it's
it's very complicated but it's so much
fun there's some great songs in there as
well
so we got the kit that has two guitars
in it so we can both play and also get
the game and you can set it all up from
there but I could not recommend this
game more it is so much fun few more
accessories Alex is obsessed with this
right now
so I thought I'd mention X it's a great
thing to buy for anyone any going this
Christmas who likes his xbox and it's
the limited edition white controller so
it's got its white it's got gold
sections on it so gold buttons on the
back buttons on the front the controller
I think it's pretty bad panic game but
it's a little bit cheaper on Amazon so
just have a little shop around and also
from game is a set of player earphones
Alex is obsessed with you see that Air
Force XO one
Turtleback baking on top of thing
so he sits like this in his little you
talk to people it's really cute so at
the moment Alex and loyalty of the
youtuber guys and youtuber blogger boy
friends have all become really good
friends because they're all playing Halo
on their headsets and chatting with each
other so that's like Leon and John and
Jason Sammy's boyfriend and Steph
Mitchell app Kim rich really pebbles
boyfriend so they are all kind of having
this little like man chat thing over
there over playing Halo okay moving on I
thought I'd mentioned this this is an
awesome thing to buy for guy Alex loved
this it's one of the boom boxes and you
can set it up through bluetooth through
your phone or through anything else
really and it just plays anything that
you're playing on your phone through
bluetooth to this a great volume on it
and it also comes into in a little
travel tube as well to keep it safe but
it's really easy to use it pumps up some
volume and I just think it's a really
great travel kit so the guy who travels
a lot or maybe go camping quite a bit or
you know that sort of thing where you
need about music playing in the
background
this is a good'n I also mentioned the
fujifilm instax in my women's Christmas
gift guide and this time I've got a
black one to show you yeah an Alex
really loves this and we were taking
pictures with us yesterday actually I
just think it's just a cool little
gadget to keep around I think a lot guys
would enjoy happiness to play around
with as well in terms of accessories and
clothing pieces a pair of sunglasses I
mean I know it's Christmas but
sunglasses and that kind of treat that a
lot of people often don't treat
themselves to because it's a little bit
more money but they would really love to
get the present I know that I would so
I've got two here that I got from I
always get rice and buses from
sunglasses hot it's just easy they have
every single thing that these are pair
of ray-bans I'll leave all the models
down below and everything but this is
the polarized model the cool thing up
polarized obviously if you're driving
and you don't wanna get all the flares
light flares on
glasses if you're driving it's great for
that especially with the Sun as well I
mean I do kind of borrow these products
as well but he wears the majority or
just a standard Wayfarer style these
kind of tortoiseshell there are so many
different types Oakley I've got loads of
great services as well I'll leave all
the links down below and I also
mentioned the burberry scarf in my
womens Christmas gift guide video but
after I've seen how much Alex is loving
this scarf and how much he's been
stealing it thought I'd mention it as
well you don't have to just get the
caramel Shea there are so many others
it's a lovely black and gray one as well
that would be great for guys and again
it's just a really special present that
I think a lot of guys probably love if
you're the kind of person who prefers to
give money or vouchers or someone I
don't think you can go wrong with
Selfridges I obviously as you know it's
my favorite store but they sell
everything in there they've got beauty
for men and women
they've got men's fashion from low end
to high end there's a bit of everything
in there if the guy you're buying for
live in London Manchester or Birmingham
then they are sorted so I also think you
can't go wrong with Selfridges and you
can get them online and it delivered so
that's easy-peasy and also something
that I also don't have with me right now
show you but just an experience day it's
an easy way to go on the version
experience days whether it's a racetrack
course driving lesson whether it's a hot
air balloon ride or whether it's
whitewater rafting there are so many
different things you can do on those
experience day so it might be worth a
look so the guy who loves his music have
you thought about buying finals I mean I
know especially Alex will say yes and I
know my brother loves vinyls in fact my
stepdad does as well it's just a great
gift idea they're a bit more special I
don't really know anyone that really has
CDs nowadays does anyone still buy CDs
if not it's kind of cool to go back to
the retro sky and go back to the vinyls
and they're also great for wall
decorations so at the moment alex is
planning on getting those two frames to
put our finals in and making them into
nice wall decorations you've also got
artwork out of them which is pretty cool
we get finals online you can get them in
places like pop music
HMV I'm sure sort of sign off and then
when you have that that's when you need
to buy
the vinyl player this is one from the
brand Crossley and it was opens up the
super you use a little case it just
plugs in with an ordinary plug into the
wall and you can work it from there
super easy to work but it's got the
speakers in built into this so just a
nice easy bond the sound coming from
this one it's nowhere near as a sound
from the larger ones I do have the
larger one as well in white which is
gorgeous I'll leave a link down below
but it's currently into lots of things I
don't have to get it out whereas I think
I'll just show you this one but I'll be
honest the sound on this one isn't quite
as good as the right one and the white
one is a little bit more it's got a few
more features to it but just as like a
starter kit vinyl player this is a nice
one to go with I don't want to make this
too long I just want you to mention kind
of the basics and the things I'm going
to be buying my boys in my family so
hopefully it helps you I'm really hoping
you saw something and it's maybe kind of
hid and sparked an idea thank you so
much for watching as always make sure
you subscribe if you haven't already so
that you can watch all froma s-- and
everything else for december and give
this video a like if you liked it I'll
see you all see why what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
