thought I would do a bit of a Christmas
party haul video inspirational video so
let's get to it so I've got a little
pile of clothes behind me so first of
all is this gorgeous jumpsuit from I
quit an addict wear which I think if we
run into a qaq so sorry if that's wrong
but they used to call it aqua aqua and I
used to love the brand then because they
do the most gorgeous structured party
outfits and more sophisticated outfit
sort of more special events and this is
a literally long jumpsuit all in black
well this beautiful soft embellished
halter neck with sequins and this cutout
detail and it's also got a new tracking
so although you look like you're wearing
nothing underneath it you're completely
covered so it's better to wear without
brass kind of get the entire effect and
then obviously it's completely open back
with the hot neck which goes into these
lovely long black and wide leg trousers
with the zip off the back of the
trousers again this is a such a
sophisticated classy outfit just to kind
of throw on with so maybe some nude
pumps some tall nude beige eye cream
heels maybe and just like a little tiny
jacket but if jewelry and it's
absolutely gorgeous and that is 155
pounds
I think the Marcone aqua
then this absolute baby dress which is
from a little mistress and I refuse it's
on my blog and said how much an absolute
princess dress it was it's just so
stunning with this little band our
bodice section elasticated back so
you'll have to worry about it fitting to
snog a little bit of padded cops it's a
bit of pleating effect on the front that
goes into this gorgeous skirt let's
embellish all over with these little
tiny flower petals and if it's got to to
sort of shape not too short so you won't
feel like you have to keep kind of
pulling it down or making feeling like
you're exposed at any time and it's a
perfect kind of length they see the size
eight which I would say I would play
need a size six it's a little bit sort
of larger on me so I sort of thought
I've had to keep icing it up but if
you're maybe size 10 I would say size
down to size eight is behind it on but I
absolutely adore this I think this was
100 pounds maybe 120 pounds it's
absolutely beautiful
then another dress from aqua aqua and
this time it's like a little black
peplum number gorgeous crosshatch shape
at the front it's really low neckline
and they also have included some little
cups inside it so you don't have to
worry brass you can still feel like
you're covered with something so without
a brows look really really sexy it's got
the back comes along the back straight
back with the zip down there peplum
skirt all the way around and again it's
not too mini you won't feel as though
you keep hump to put down and it's got
quite a good length in it quite
sophisticated length really so that is
another gorgeous piece for more
sophisticated event or occasion that
you're going to and I think it would be
a really statement
and elegant outfit so that is 150 pounds
from a-courtin aqua then I've got this
absolutely beautiful dress which is from
a gorgeous boutique brand that I found
recently called all off without measure
it's a lovely light some was like a very
light line color not too brush just a
really sort of neutral sort of light
green and it's got sort of this v-neck
shape to it sort of flared arms and it's
almost like a shirt dress so it's up to
you if you wanted to wear it bare legs
and just sits on its own I've also on it
with a belt soft section in the center
then it's got this beautiful detailing
on the back or it's off cut out with
this kind of over section it's beautiful
lace detail and it's just so stunning
it's just sort of really surreal and
sort of angelic and I think again it
could be a really sort of statement
piece really feminine so that's I
absolutely adore and I definitely would
recommend you check out look without
measure because there's such a beautiful
pieces I think this is 40 pounds then I
have a dress from rare London which is
an even longer dress this is a this is
more of a midi dress entirely navy blue
with this embossing and sort of floral
detail on the front how neck cuts out
sides so no sleeves and a gold zip up
the back again really elegant and
sophisticated you could wear this to so
many different occasions I look hot down
a little blazer over it you could have
the wear some really tall heels like
Jeffrey Campbell heels that's where I
wear it or you could wear it with some
little pumps like Louboutin style pumps
and it would looks really with the
classy really elegant so that is
beautiful and I think that's 45 pounds
and we leave all the links and all the
prices below because I'm awful with
prices so make sure I'll get it right so
go and check that out if you wonder what
prices that's from relevant
then I've got this beautiful dress from
Celebrity k-- which I wore recently for
a birthday party it's kind of got this
in laughs Dini fabric and saucy it fits
you like it's really fitted effect and
again if not overly Minnie you're not
always pulling it down off your bomb and
feeling like people can see it your bum
cheeks and but it's a nice sort of sexy
legs
it's gorgeous gold and black almost like
an art deco print detail down the front
and it is just so different to anything
I really own in kind of monochrome
colors a gold bit of detailing and it's
lovely low neck at low back so it's up
to you if you want to wear a bra or not
if you can even find a transparent back
bra to wear with it otherwise to swear
it out the brown and the brave well the
ethnicity boutique and this is a hundred
pounds but it would be so perfect for so
many different types of occasions events
and quite Christmasy with the gold so I
love that one of my all-time favorites
is this lace suit which is from Motel
rocks and I got it from Mimi calm it's a
lovely zigzag kind of embellished emboss
kind of fabric that's all explained but
it's sort of slightly sheer at the top
so if you own a black bear under you can
only just see it it's not too showing
because it's on sale in black but at the
bottom I'm a short section it's lined
with black fabric so you don't have to
worry about shouldn't have your bottom
half that totally covered but it's a
lovely length these aren't too sharp
they're also not too long so it's sort
of a really sexy effect high back we
have the slip down the back and I have
worn this so many times and I absolutely
adore it just it's a so sophisticated
with like long arm so I literally
showing off all of your legs because I
don't really ever wear tight dresses so
I sure I followed my legs in the shorts
but then if you cover up your arms and
I've seen not showing too much up here
it kind of gives it that very elegant
sophisticated look so this I think if 45
pounds ish from EMU calm offering motel
rocks or few other places sell it and
that's that's a winner for pretty much
any occasion then I have a winner for
most people which is the Gabby motel
rocks dress and this is really popular I
think they did the last year and this
year they'll come out with a couple of
different colors maybe I'm not sure but
this is the iridescent purple call that
they also do black and green I think
what this is the purple one sits on a
purple fluffy fabric covered in these
green and pink sequins all over certain
different lights catches the lights
beautifully and again
not overly mini not too short and quite
high back dip in the back which gives it
a bit Marva off-the-shoulder effect
really when it falls on the sides of his
shoulders long sleeves so again very
kind of elegant quite classy but still
so Pat like party holiday season.the
style and it's just really really
gorgeous so that could go for so many
different occasions parties this year
I'll be wearing this a lot with some big
chunky heels and maybe a nice light
colored little blazer over the top so I
love this that's also so that's from
Motel rocks and that's about 45 pounds
then I have this little number which is
actually it from glamorous but and I got
it from own the runway calm and a little
cream ivory play suit a bit of a
pleating effect in the front for a bit
of detail cap sleeves her back with a
sit down back and again the shorts
aren't too short and quite a nice length
to them and yeah again you could swear
there's so many fun accessories a nice
bright pink bag a bright orange bag just
add that pop of color and nice bright
shoes you could even go with silver sure
you still the bad gold shoes gold bag
you've got have got a black canvas with
a white place suit like this so there's
so many things he could wear this with
little blazer over it our nice book
jacket and it would go with most things
so I think this was around 40 pounds so
again you can wear this was so much
especially around the Christmas time so
I love that as well another place it is
this one from misguided which had so
many compliments on it's just such a
stunning color so this is cobalt blue
thick nails to do it in a nude and it
comes with these sort of scalloped
shorts at the bottom and nice golden
black belt around the middle to cinch
you in and no sleeves high neck high
back
so although it's also quite short it's
still quite it doesn't sort of show any
of your top half you can sort of show
off your arms so it kind of keeps that
almost classiness it's not too it's not
too much that people are going to be
little got you're not wearing any
clothes absolutely adore it so many
compliments on it and so many people
love this so I think this is around 35
pounds and that's misguided another blue
number is this one from love clothing
and it's a lovely long blue jumpsuit
nice elasticated kind of back see seem
lovely sweetheart neckline of Seban down
style
it's kind of got bones that's as well
kind of keeps its shape and that goes
all the way into these almost creamy
style pants which are not too wide legs
really so again nice sort of bright
number square for a lot of different
occasions a nice white jacket will be
lovely with this and some of the cream
shoes or even maybe like a dark black or
navy shoe be quite nice soft poking out
in the bottom it's a nice bit of nice
bit of jewelry and again kind of very
statement piece that's so bright I love
that and that is around 35 pounds
and then also I am wearing a dress which
was perfect for Christmas
this is from Motel rocks and it is a
sleeveless dress with a high neck and
it's just put all way down it's not a
print it's like a black and white sequin
detailing all the way down and it's it's
kind of like a mini dress really but not
again not too many it's not just
covering your bomb it is a little bit
lower but obviously when you start
walking around in it you'll find that
you have to do pull it down but what
dress don't you do that with so this
again is gorgeous
I've one that's a few times with few
different events and I think this again
is around 45 pounds and last but not
least my absolute favorite of them all
which some of you may have seen before
is this jumpsuit which is from misguided
and I've have so many compliments on
this how the signs to grab a few times
and it's just so many people absolutely
adore it
it's a sequin silver bustier with almost
like cups included inside so bit of
padding but under wiring that goes down
into these creamy lung flared trousers
so this I will be wearing with a pair of
nude Louboutin shoes louboutin pumps a
little bit of jewelry and provide a soft
curly hair need sort of reading my hair
later cuz in fact I am going out later
and I will be wearing this and so I'm
gonna have like nice curly hair with it
I'm probably going to wear my long new
Sandro they camel jacket with it it make
it even more elegant and sophisticated
but it's just so stunning I think it's
about 35 to 60 pounds it's just one of
those things I think a lot of people
will just adore and be so complimentary
honest it's just
stunning just quite sort of 80s I think
but it's just beautiful and I would
highly recommend this one for any kind
of pie do you thinking of going to
that's a winner so that is everything
