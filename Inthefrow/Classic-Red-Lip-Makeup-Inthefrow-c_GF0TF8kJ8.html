makeup look video now look at that I am
doing today is more of myself event
makeup the sort of go-to products for my
base but then a red lip which I don't do
as often as I really really should
because I really love it especially now
I have the white gray hair I think it
looks really cool so I'm on my way out
now to events I thought that I'd kind of
bring you along and show you what I was
doing on my face it's a very sort of
matte i lots of eyeliner and lashes and
a beautiful red lip you think the new
kendall Jenner Estee Lauder color which
is beautiful I'm not use it yet so I
thought I'd use it today that's
everything so if you like this look then
just keep watching okay I'm just gonna
start off by dousing my face with a
Clinique Moisture Surge face spray I'm
so obsessed with that it's just like oh
my job as always the million dollar
moisturizer this routine is pretty much
gonna be my go to event makeup so if I'm
going to about any events and things I'm
gonna go in with the Mac strobe cream
either this or the Becca shimmering skin
enhancing pearl they both do practically
the same job I think today I'm going to
go for the Lancome miracle a top 10
ranking foundations are always quite
velvety when you put them on
add this all over ya I'd highly
recommend if you thinking of getting a
Lunken foundation at highly recommend
out of this one or just the Lancome
miracle detent I'm gonna say 10 but now
you say shot John
Tom Jack okay I have a lot of different
concealers I go to what you have seen
it's usually either nice creamy
concealer Mac Pro Longwear or Kevin Kwan
or the Clarins instant concealer either
one it's brilliant but I usually always
use some Mac prep and prime first of all
just and triangles under nose and right
there - like I'll go for Clarence today
and I'm just like a dot to the out
quarter a dot to the inner corner drag
it along here
work listen with the damp Beauty Blender
there are some days when my concealer
doesn't quite look perfect and it's
usually when I've had bad night suite
which I did last night
really about night sleep so I'm going to
go in with the Bobbi Brown corruption in
a light peach and just dabbing my Beauty
Blender into that just gonna go over the
top in this very section here okay okay
so I'm so proud ring now I usually the
different few different things I either
use the hourglass is very light as you
see Laura Mercier translucent powder at
the moment I am still using the banana
powder out of the anastasia beverly
hills palette season in louise young ly
for eight brush and then just using the
louise young a life sized one to start
contouring as it usually do like to make
my stripe and then go from that blending
that
and as always the Estee Lauder bronze
goddess with the Real Techniques powder
brush ice nice look really really really
bronze at all times
yeah I'm just gonna use the by Terry
Baume De Rose lip bar now just why
laughs are on my desk
okay so similar to how lot of my
tutorials have been recently using the
Becca
Jacqueline Hill champagne pop I do want
a very highlighted look for this so I'm
gonna go in heavy with this bad boy
round I really want to use my usual
washer the Charlotte celebrate but I
feel like I've been really dull so
instead I'm gonna try some too new I'm
going to try the Urban Decay afterglow
powder blush in video I'm gonna go with
the Tarte tartlet palette I think
something mat with a red lip will look
really cute
it's gonna take a real techniques brush
I'm gonna use supermom those lighter
shade putting that on Nate in a corner
near in the third of the lid I'm going
to use my Mac two one seven with force
of nature
this one right here into the crease of
course line over the top I'm not going
to join it up I'm just going to kind of
leave it out and join over like that and
then I'm going to take another fluffy
brush and I'm just gonna run free spirit
and a bit of this supermom over the rest
of the lid
I don't want it to be really lazy and
not much color there and then just
taking the Sigma e-40 I'm just going to
take a little bit of free spirit and
supermom again just onto that
here just
blow out of it and for browsers I'm
going to use a mixture of the iron Brown
maestro from Armani in number two and
also the Illamasqua or you'll see me do
my brows
a thousand times so I'm going to skip
past this
I do my brows and pretty much every
other tutorial so feel free to go to
that if you like I'm just gonna fix that
in place with HD brows you to some
aligner
I'm gonna use my fav Tom Ford yes it's
pricey but it's so good
and I want years of sitting with the
tummy Bear party when he's heard new
lashes these are the every day full of
two lashes and they're just little
corner ones you see then put my own
natural lashes because they're very
straight Emily use the Lancome Hypnose
doll eyes waterproof mascara
okay so cut let's corn lashes applied
nice and fluttery and all we have to do
now is the lips so I'm going to use the
Illamasqua pencil in ice tea
who's the kendall Jenner estee lauder
lipstick in Restless
and that is a finished look
but yeah I'm really gonna please the
makeup I hope you like it let me know
