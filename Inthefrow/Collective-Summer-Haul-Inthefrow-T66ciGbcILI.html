video it's been so long since I filmed a
whole video I am really really excited
about it I've got quite a few things
from misguided from River Island and
also from a sauce so also top shop as
well and the most amazing pair of
trainers so gonna get through them all
and show you how they all look on as
well so let's get into it okay I'm gonna
start off with bits from River Island
first thing I found this beautiful
blouse it's not quite barge oh it's not
quite off the shoulder but it does have
quite a wide neckline on this with some
beautiful
Brody John blaze lace trims and cutout
work it's really really pretty it's very
kind of feminine the very boho inspired
spring trend and also have a buttons
down the back tooth so this is super
pretty
whoo and this with jeans and heels may
make it a little bit more feminine and
pretty with this shirt louse or you
could maybe pair it with some shorts for
summer again it's a very kind of boho
it's summer style I also picked up
another blouse from Ryland this one is a
vest shape in a very large cutout floral
print it's a very kind of thick fabric
really but I find this is beautiful
again with jeans if you're not watching
some heels and evening and you wanna
wear something pretty but not to address
this is really really perfect beautiful
girls sit down back and it's not too
short either so this is a crop so this
will hide all manner of sins but you
want to cover up but I really really
like it so this is really pretty
again another thing from River Island I
think I mentioned to my favorites video
but I'm going to mention it again
because I bought it recently and I think
it's incredible and it's sis
suede real suede skirt from River Island
beautiful tan color very wearable easy
to wear with anything either of those
tops I've just shown you
would be perfect with this again with
heels if you want to dress it up a
little bit Oh again you can wear with
trainers you can wear it little pumps
very little flat shoes you could wear it
with lace-up shoes all the way up to
your knees the possibilities are endless
because it's such a kind of neutral cool
piece I got this from a sauce from River
Island because I think on River Island
is completely sold out slowly the links
down below we can get it boy beautiful
that's it for reverend's but on the
topic of skirt I've also got another two
this month first of all is a marble
splurge purchase I made from the AG
jeans Alexa Chung collection she's just
brought out or they've just brought out
this is a navy corduroy fabric it looks
like I own any corduroy but I saw this
and just tilt it further boat straight
away I really like the little details it
has on it so it's got the AC for Ag here
I'm selecting for photo G jeans and all
the buttons have this cute little
detailing on it the LX trim for Ag and
I'm detailing but again this sort of
skirt is so in at the moment and it goes
with so much and although this is a
little bit more expensive and everything
else I mentioned in here I just thought
I'd get so much wear outfit especially
the summer and also into winter as well
with some nice tights or knee-high boots
beautiful and last thing I want to
mention was this beautiful little
miniskirt from November night you may
know if November night if not you should
have a look at then the sight is so cool
it's been made by Sammy Jason sunny
Beauty crush I'm sure all of you know
and love I certainly love our shoes on
those awesome people I've ever met
anyway she created her own clothing
brand which is so awesome and this is
one of three pieces from that really
cool little mini skirt it's in a black
fabric a very soft thick cotton
fabric and I feel a bit a classification
to its very back waistband getting in
there and is it down the back but it's
super cute again for summer just for
tucking little tops into little vests
even I'm definitely gonna be taking it
on my holidays okay this is actually top
for a Bronco pinky pinky but I picked up
from a sauce I don't know I'm really
enjoying this very kind of a pretty
feminine look at the moment and this is
a gorgeous little light top with this
again sort of broderie anglaise style
course at work at the front frayed I was
like a frayed edge really pretty though
really pretty and it comes through
almost like a keyhole
closing at the back with every button I
love the length on it and it's almost a
cheesecloth fabric very soft lightweight
but it cools you up and again it goes to
so much especially for sort of these
skirts so we're mentioning this is
beautiful with them this is kind of
thing out always wear them and then if
it is already have enough white tops and
shirts I also have this one from Topshop
I can't go wrong with a white shirt
especially ones like this that are
almost a little bit dead inspired it's
got that very kind of work man sort of
edge to them with the pockets and the
buttoning and almost sort of masculine
androgynous feel to them but this go
with so much and just to throw them on
and lay in them over a t-shirt or little
blouses that you've got me but it's for
a cooler day or you just wear them alone
and you could tuck them into jeans or
skirt or wear those shorts you know it's
it's so cool is so cool and kind of like
I don't know quite French about these
white shirts I love them I've got too
many I spent my morning I meaning all of
my white t-shirt and was just like what
am i doing
if you follow me on Twitter you probably
saw me mentioning that okay before I get
onto a few pieces from misguided these
shoes I can't stop looking at them
because they're just so cool these are
the adidas
America transou I don't even know what
type of shoe they are the old seller
I don't know however whatever they are
they're amazing I don't have any
trainers really I don't really wear
trainers
I'm not that kind of sporty girl I don't
know but I'm just I didn't want to start
walking to bark or in these and also
just was short for the summer needs to
be awesome
on holidays for this kind of like my
chilled out days I personally love now
you can see the amount of things she
makes I'm just like wow that's
incredible Prince she's the coolest
vibrancy of everything she creates it's
just awesome and I'm just so inspired by
my collections so when I saw she'd done
it's a collection with adidas and the so
little pieces I knew I needed at least
one piece from that and these really
stood out to me I really love them and
the fact that got the adidas stripes in
them too it's super cool and also says
America something on the back
last but not least misguided pick to a
few bits are misguided this place OOP
first of all I've seen this on the
website and just absolutely loved it
it's a Bardot style and it's got some
little sleeves in it as well in case you
were wondering if it's too short quite
like stripes at the moment but I thought
on holiday for evening that beautiful
next up a tax item I don't phone
whatsoever but saw it I like the way
they solve it and it's a pair of
dungarees it's good it's done Therese
kit what you call this oh they would
like a turtleneck how I neck top with
long sleeve and it looks super chic and
I really loved it so cute don't you
think this is a third skirt you're going
to see in this haul that is practically
the same but a different color and it's
another one of these none of these
button-up skirt oh yeah I'm obsessed
with them but this is again I kind of
corduroy material and this time in
pearlescent pink dusty rose pink and now
it's very much drawn to our thought with
the mother two white tops it would look
extremely cute for summer going into
autumn so I like another things show you
was this jacket so sleeveless jackets I
own for a two-minute sleep with jackets
but you know quite like them and this
one is in this pink just you know pink
sleeveless like say it's belted spelling
bonk and on the model on the website
also with these big sort of big flowy
collar to it yeah it's really really
like that and could potentially look
pretty nice sell fashion me so I thought
I'd picks up too by the way if you're
wondering what makeup I'm wearing that
just watch my last video because I do
this entire routine and also if you
wondering what this top is it's from a
lovely small independent brand
