routine so if you're interesting how I
get my hair to this stage please go and
have a look at that video I'll leave the
link in the downbar so for this video I
am going to be styling my hair and this
time with a new tool that I've got from
Tony guy and it's an hourglass want to
and don't use these kind of wands very
often I often use straightness if I want
to kill my hair so I'm quite interested
to see how this works for my hair I've
never used it before so this will be a
first time for both of us to see and but
hopefully quite easy for me to use so
here we go inside box it comes with the
wand with standard on/off switch and
also comes with a look and see me able
to obviously hold and you hair onto the
standing one and up in your fingers so
it's gonna sit ok so since you're gone
product I use every time I kill my hair
it's this GHD curl on spray it's
brilliant because it's got he protectant
spray in it and it's also got a curl
holding spray so it's great just to
spritz through your hair
kill your hair and make it and it makes
sure that your hair is pushed against
the heat while it's also cold my girls
so I recommend this come on Barry here
so I knew how much they're doing I'm
sharing you and got a clip for my hair
so I'm just going to section so
generally what I do is just go advantage
of the ears
this is out of the way then then I step
a tangle teezer make sure it's all
brushed through knocks hey so I'm going
to start on this side so that means that
I need okay so I'm going to try and make
quite nice large waste and I take a
piece of hair that's about two inches
across like that smooth I'm going to put
it underneath the back starting at the
root of it and then around the top
you can twist it ends to get you from
all the route in keep little girl so
this is the best Cal I just started
pulling it through and it is really cute
little zigzag ways gorgeous so I'm going
to carry on
like I said opponent like this and then
feel with your fingers when your head
gets really hot too much just cute okay
I'm taking with my wide sections if you
want really small little ringlets feel
free to take it
okay so the site is done because it's
quite nice little way that's coming
through
I bet all the way through the back so
just spray which is running out all the
sides and working on this side by
holding again kind of brochures bitch
get these have hair they had before out
the way
once you clip back okay so now I'm gonna
have the actual are you want to work
with you should go around the temples
Manchester okay so how do you kill spray
now give it a rush
give it a good look Spray throughout and
then we should be a blue very final
piece
just spray well then sorry the lighting
is so yellow I was filming in daylight
but then someone in and it's just
getting darker and darker as it's taking
me so long to film so very sorry about
that right so with my hair I prefer to
have my curls are coming from like here
downwards so I'm not gonna go completely
to the roots of this I don't think you
can look a little bit silly sometimes I
wish there may look like it's aa all on
this side which is much easier to curl
so again a little bit of spray at this
point I'd probably as well go into my
roots a little bit is the finished hand
a really human blood curls all my down
if I was gonna leave an out generally
what I would do
it's in my hair like this and now get
some little silver grips and then get a
little bit fringe to take from piece and
I can even do all cut your hair coming
down one side oh you like natural kind
of curls these and then using a teaser
if you take something like a big that's
it
I hope that was helpful for you and
hopefully I'll give you a bit of an idea
of how to use the towing guy and
hourglass want it ask me think buying if
you want this kind of really defined
spiral curls that kind of thing and this
is also really really great for you and
I have some really enjoy geez matter
don't use ones very often but this is
quite easy to use it heats up so much
that you get really defined curls within
about 10 seconds which is great and also
make sure the even heat that's very
every single time you see myself in yes
if you want to find out how I style my
hair wash it and dry it then watch the
video that came for this one I'll take
all details about that there's also a
lots more information on my blog in the
fro calm if you like tweet box as well
and please do like this video if you
enjoyed it and subscribe if you're new
to the channel and hope I see you all
again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
