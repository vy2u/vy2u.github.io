town big-time big-time also I'm really
pleased I thought I'd shrunk this top
 it all right
hey it still got cookies and dog hair
all over it from Chicago
but never mind today I only have one
thing on the agenda and I'm so so happy
about it I'm just going getting my face
shot be a skin clinics in comments last
night I'm not seeing those guys in
months and since I've not been seeing
them I've had so many breakouts like
looking forward to having like a full
facial full peel and you should have an
OHA resurfacer and things like that so
I'm quite looking forward to having all
that done yeah I'm gonna go get that
done and then head back BRABUS work the
rest day to go yes just chill out
because I don't really want to put any
makeup on my face after my facial and
and all that so we will see what a
really horrible great day
but I'm Here I am Here I am excited oh
gosh don't talk attractive at all I've
just had my aah a reserved sir on my
skin and it does all it does is just
kind of break down the very top surface
of the skin so it kind of reveals this
beautiful fresh gorgeous skin beneath
and it look how blue it looks already so
I'm just having
treatment just really helps like
collagen Wow creams
can you explain I cannot lift it so this
is Sony shape radio frequency we
actually use three different wavelengths
one is called mono polar the other is
called bipolar meaning two wavelengths
and the others try Fona
so at the moment Victoria having
tri-polar rotary frequency so it can go
deep into the skin layers as well but it
also will help discriminate superficial
collagen fibers very relaxed and your
red light is infrared against a red
light is the light that we use for
stimulating collagen to anything red
light base we know it's gonna start
stimulating and activating collagen and
encouraging the body to produce new
fibers amazing and that is what we want
I decided I'm going to do my Christmas
wrap pink yeah I've got lots of little
bits and bobs here that haven't yet
wrapped so I might start wrapping up my
presents for people so I got this from
next ribbons and bows and some really
cute my lucky it's this like silvery
metallic wrapping paper wanted to do
Alexes because I wanna put a like who's
inside of his stuck in and he's just
gone out meeting a friend Kyle he's an
amazing photographer I just got out a
little bit
well I just need to do some work but I
really wanna do this whilst alex is out
so I'm going to quickly wrap his gifts
and I'm not going to show you because
obviously he's gonna see this I did just
get some things for the post so and I
don't know what this is oh I think this
might be from Google I can't believe
this I put so many cool things about
these check it out thank you so much
Google perhaps the incredible gift I
can't believe this this is a current
situation I am in bed I'm nice and cozy
in bed alex is just out there someone
yeah I just posted a brand new blog post
it's about the fact that I feel like I'm
living in limbo in the moment and open
think alex has read this one yeah I know
it's the fact that we're apparently
living in limbo land as I like to call
it but you may have seen a Maine cigar
my just posted another picture from this
kind of story of pictures that I did but
I loved them so much and I'd only posted
one photo from it and I felt it's a bit
of a shame well I mean like
like the landscape is so epic I've just
posted my newest one so I've actually
managed now to do about 8 or so videos
in a row including two that were sit
down kind of like have more produced non
vlogs and quite a few that are vlogs so
I'm quite proud of myself cuz I don't
really expect to do that an expert did
you vlog mr. toll so I hope you enjoying
the vlog so far guys so pretty much I've
got my sippy cup ready my little mini
mood how old am I again and because I
was at the a Skin Clinic earlier I got a
top-up of all of them and what's a
5-step Prost program that they have
skincare routine and because my skin's
been so bad recently have thought that I
would go back to this against the
cleanser awesome but I don't need to
cleanse takes it out and make fun and
what the one especially only uses this
one the vitamin C 20% in hyaluronic acid
serum like these like more scientific
you know skin care products that's why
they've actually got like real vitamin C
amounts in them so when I use that I'm
gonna use the firming serum and I might
also use this College and complex cream
so I'm gonna put those on I drink my
drink and I'm gonna write a new blog

thing we're doing today is we're going
