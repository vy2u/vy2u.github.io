all doing so well this is going to be my
three makeup looks in just one day from
gym to daytime to evening routine looks
and in between I'm gonna be showing you
how amazing the new Garnier micellar oil
infused cleansing water is like
seriously this is incredible I'm gonna
be showing you how I use it to take off
my makeup in between one makeup look and
another as well and especially at the
end of the day so if you'd like to know
how I go from gym today to evening
makeup and I'll be in between then just
keep on watching let's be honest some
people don't like to wear makeup at the
gym I often do not whatsoever especially
if I'm gone in the morning I'll just go
straight to the gym come back wash my
face and get on with it there are some
days when I'm extremely tired I've not
had a very good night's sleep and I just
want something on my face each their own
it's up to you how confident you are so
not wear makeup some days I don't feel
confident enough to not kind of put a
little bit on so that's just up to makes
its each the realm of this so I'm just
going to show you what I would put on
for a very very light coat of makeup if
I'm going for a gym session just
starting off with the blessed triple
oxygen radiance restoring mist this is
really nice is to insert a little bit
more kind of moisture into very dry skin
morning it's gonna go in now with the
your dream skin perfect skin creator
this is just really really moisturizing
it sort of adds a little bit of
luminescence back into your skin now I'm
just gonna add a bit of the Mac prep and
prime underneath my eyes only a little
bit just to kind of hide these dark
circles a tad
then I'm gonna ask him in the
bareMinerals complexion rescue in
vanilla this is just one of those really
great hydrating tints I just add a
little bit more color to your skin well
so you know that bare minerals is really
quite good for kind of allowing
breathable makeup so this is kind of
what I like to go for I'm just gonna rub
that in with my hands because I don't
want like ridiculously heavy coverage
just want it to just be was very fresh
skin so now my skin is just looking a
little bit more alive but then still
barely anything really going on I'm just
gonna add a little bit of the benefit
gimme brow and this is in number three
because you know I like quite dark brows
this will just add a little bit more
color and shape we're gonna add a little
bit of the Estee Lauder bronze goddess
literally a tiny bit just to kind of
redefine my cheeks again that's
literally it's a tiny bit of redefining
of the cheeks then just for the lips I'm
going to you see she thought she lip
balm it's a very cute light pink shade
and to finish I'm gonna add is a little
bit of powder just so my face is not too
shiny I mean you see bare minerals this
is when the new ones got matte and a
more glowing one's gonna go from that
one on hourglass
and that's all I'm gonna do no mascara
because I can't be bothered with the
whole thing where you're rubbing your
eyes it's going everywhere literally
just a more glowing and radiant base
that's all I'm after so this is my chin
look so I'm gonna move into my second
look which is my just very easy everyday
simple makeup look since going for a few
meetings in the city but of course for
those sort of things I do prefer a more
flawless coverage and if it had been to
the gym my skin would be a little bit
more sweaty
it would have perspired and therefore
I'd want to take off this entire makeup
look this is what I'm going to be using
the Garnier micellar oil infused
cleansing water if you know me well
you'll know I have had a few favorites
when it comes to this kind of product in
the past and I've stuck to them for
years
pretty much however this is kind of come
along and totally rocked up my entire
routine completely in honesty I'm so
happy because this is a fraction of the
price of the products I used to buy
because you know me I like to use
waterproof makeup and therefore I need
something that can remove waterproof
mascara is long-lasting foundation is
long-lasting lipstick so anything that
gets removed everything super fast
without leaving those smudges or dark
lines it's so brilliant this is my
second bottle that I'm on totally hooked
on this product now this is completely
changed of everything and like I said
it's just so much more inexpensive than
everything else I've ever used so I'm a
little bit in love with this now give
this a bit of a shake-up to mix up the
oil and water content and then straight
on to a compact just go so simply wipe
away everything I also find this it
feels nicer on my skin and some micellar
waters often do it feels like it's
removing things it feels like it's still
kind of hydrating on the skin feel like
this really keeps my skin hydrated okay
done and unto luck number two like I
said a very everyday simple makeup look
starting off with a million dollar
moisturizer
a foundation today I'm going back to you
on my absolute favorites the Illamasqua
skin base and this is in ballpoint fanuc
she's kind of like my no tan color I'm
just going to use a more fit and for 3:9
brush this time for concealer I'm going
to use some mac prolongwear concealer
again like just on the back of my
we think in two eyes I'm gonna use the
Tom Ford let's just like a cream
eyeshadow pop in spice on the back of my
hand this is a very simple quick easy I
look with one brush and one color
you take off the excess on the back of
my hand
and use that brush now to blend
and then when the larger fluffy brush
I'm just going to use my lorac Pro
palette can use any color but it's just
like a yellowy soft beige tone I'm just
gonna use that on my brow bone I'm just
gonna help blend out those edges now the
rest of the base I'm just gonna take my
Galan terracotta Four Seasons bronzer in
number three natural very beautiful
beautiful shade of bronzer I'm just
using this as a bronzer and a little bit
of a kind of defining hieronymus so it's
always the size of my temples onto my
forehead down my nose a little bit onto
my cheeks and then I like to blend it
down cheek and onto the neck I'm just
gonna pound it with a bit of the
beautiful Galan meteorite pills
a little bit of blush I'm gonna use my
favorite Kevin a Quan the creamy glow
duo in propeller engine Al and I always
let's take this the lighter of the two
onto my Real Techniques duo-fiber
contour brush very light amount I don't
want too much because if the duck let's
put on some eyebrows I'll quickly do
this because you've seen it so many
times before but just my Armani spoolie
brush my I am brow maestro from Armani
in wedge snitched off with the
Illamasqua brow build
for mascara just a little my lashes I'm
gonna use one of my trusty faves the
Clarins waterproof mascara
/ it's done and all its left is lips I'm
gonna go with the anastasia beverly
hills in naked this one
I'm changing my mind slightly something
is a look at the anastasia beverly hills
and crush just kind of around the edges
deepen up the call out a little bit
I'm back from my meetings you can
probably tell it's probably written all
over my face I've been out all day look
but makeup has kind of gone from my face
from earlier so I want to get into look
number three and that is for tonight
mean aren't for going on bit of a date
night so I just show you how I usually
would spruce up my makeup from kind of
day where to evening where when I'm sort
of going straight out and I don't have
enough time to take everything off and
put it all back on again
however this liquid lipstick is very
long lasting and extremely hard wearing
so I'm going to use the Garnier oil
infused cleansing water at once again
just to take off my lipstick to come a
little bit out and swipe this away okay
so now I can start with some touch-ups
it's all going to be pretty simple and
almost as enhancing what we have now
since we go back into the Illamasqua
foundation game just take a little bit
of that product and also a little bit of
the napkin Prime in medium and then
again of my damp Beauty Blender use a
bit of that Illamasqua and just start
working get in two areas just to kind of
enhance the foundation we already have
I'm gonna use the same powder again on
the same brush and just go over any bits
again to make sure everything stops set
down now take a little bit more bronzer
the Clarins limited edition bronze eggs
it's just a little bit more kind of
nighttime I feel so going over okay
highlights so I'm going to go with the
anastasia glow kits and i'm gonna go for
dripping in gold this is a lovely bronzy
gold shade zoe that looks fan brush
now if the eyes I'm gonna kind of keep
it quite simple and let's just go back
into my bronzer and some of the more
darker shades in here and just work into
what we already have going on just a
little bit more
underneath my lash line
I'm just going to use a little bit of
the Loreal apart mute and rose it's very
much a shade straight into my inner
corners just to intensify the whole eye
look I'm gonna go with the Lancome grunt
wah liner mascara finish we just need
some lips so I'm gonna go with the
Clinique intense passion
are we gonna put this on this is the
anesthesia
candy-apple I love it it's the top one
off there's one last thing I want to do
actually and it's just too tight line my
eyes with a black
my three looks in just one day
