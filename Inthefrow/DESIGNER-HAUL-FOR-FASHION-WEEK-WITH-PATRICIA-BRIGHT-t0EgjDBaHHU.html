welcome back to Patricia you don't
remember me Patricia still like a year
ago yeah which feels like so long so
long so much has happened since we had
to film again yeah and we're actually
filming saucing yeah I just don't know
we did like key pieces last time and
this is gonna keep pieces for Fashion
Week
so you thought we put together a bit of
a Fashion Week whole show you.if bought
for Fashion Week I mean you'll be seeing
this after we've worn them but it's
almost like showing you exactly what we
wore and favorite pieces that we were
gonna wear yeah so it's just like in my
favorite key pieces that I've got for
the season Daniels as well and I'm
excited to see all your bits and bobs as
well yeah love it right do you want to
go first okay so the first thing I have
is this
JW Anderson and crutch and for me I just
saw the gold detail on it and I was like
this is absolutely amazing and I saw a
couple of other bloggers and who had
this bag and I thought it looked
gorgeous on them and dream flash chiming
it's nice to have a little black bag but
something that stands out and isn't too
big to carry around two shows and I
thought this was just ideal for me
perfect I'll be taught that leather is
so soft it is gorgeous yeah it's it's
gorgeous and he's a UK designer as well
and he's showing to Fashion Week so I
thought it will be like a homage to UK
designers because it's just fabulous I
love that yeah I love it that is so
beautiful I might need that now okay
watch this is a bag
it's so big I mean look at that detail
the gold on the inside and it's got
little extras here just gorgeous and
then yeah well the logo itself pushes up
and then I mean I've still got all stuff
so it keep the shape now but how people
literally is the Queen's favorite bag
Browns
I honestly saw this and was like it just
has elegant all over it yeah beautiful
love it
but it also has a long shoulder strap so
you can kind of wear it crossbody and
make it even not quite as elegant yeah a
little bit more kind of cool yeah yeah
the same time let's fill out a little
elegant like dinner day and thank this
is amazed and I love the chui gorgeous
look and I don't see many people with
lauderbach's know so I'm really really
excited about this it's so gorgeous
plus with this particular design of the
bag 20% of the proceeds from this bag
goes towards the Queen's charity which
is the British crafts industry which is
really lovely yeah thank ya love it okay
so um it's obviously nice to have like
new bits that would be expensive and
stuff you know fashion we can design and
yadda-yadda yeah but I bought myself
this bargain gorgeous satin dress with
this gorgeous detail at the bottom
you're never gonna guess how much I paid
for this dress it was 12 pounds it was
12 pounds on azores and I just thought
this was just a completely new and kind
of see I'm into like shiny and pink and
I saw this I was like how gorgeous is
this because I thought it was it was on
sale though I'm saying it was honest it
wasn't like originally top pounds but it
was on sale on the site and I thought it
would go really nice with the piece that
I'm going to show as well but I like to
wear high street you know if I am gonna
go to Fashion Week and then make it look
a bit more expensive and pair it with
designer pieces because you know it's
quite expensive to buy designer clothes
but you can make something look
expensive that's great especially if you
get it go to our pounds definitely I
mean if you if you bought continuously
designer clothes it would just cost yeah
and it comes to be out of season uh yeah
yeah with your accessories to transcend
eyeglass all in different seasons and
that's like one of my tricks when it
comes to about dressing expensive is to
wear items are a bit simple a bit more
affordable again spend on the
accessories I love to do that Marsh eek
isn't as well I love that dress
in fact I will show my dress they still
have labels on XS still not
labels and warning oh the level of
gorgeousness beautiful it's my new
self-portrait dress I'm gonna wear one
are they so fashionably I love the way
it changes tone here this marking teal
green shade from before deep petrol Navy
almost and it's got spine ping around
the neckline is it to get you in in the
back and this waistband so this kind of
pulls him in and all the right please
yeah
I think it's gorgeous and I love
self-portrait I really feel like that
effort made for the everyday woman to
feel beautiful in the outfit is just
it's so in every piece yeah I love it
I'm totally great and I feel they've
totally got their branding down as well
yeah I know it's self-portrait piece
yeah yeah even when I've never seen it
before yeah no you know it definitely
like that's so incredible not many
brands can do you know but they've done
that amazing I love it
all right guys this piece here is my
standout piece like everyone's got to
have that drama item you know when you
go out to Fashion Week but something
that suits you and I'm the kind of girl
who I were a lot of like leather jackets
and ripped jeans that's really my style
and I just saw this also from a verse
which is clearly my you know vice and it
is got the embroidery trend on air and
this is really massive for you know
autumn winter and I just thought it was
amazing of all the color and the pattern
and the texture and the hot leather and
I was just like I'm just gonna wear this
over my shoulder with the pink dress I'm
just gonna be a badass like I'm loving
it and it's just got all this studying
on it and I thought it's got that
hardness but also with the soft
prettiness of embroidery which is it's
all me like mentally love it yeah I
really do it was it quite pricey though
quite pricey and but if you like feel
how heavy that is yeah you look it's
very good quality really robust and I'm
sure this has probably been done by hand
so I get the pricing and actually this
is the cheapest embroidery leather
jacket that I've seen so yeah cuz I'm
Topshop has one as well and I think it's
about 350 pounds really and some other
designers have them and they're more
expensive than this so yeah I was really
happy with the price
so that's incredible yeah good find
Patricia good financing it's really
really good love it
okay so I'll share one of my outerwear
pieces to faux fur juillet from reese
this is like the new season and it's
just incredible I mean how soft is out
I'm just striking it here it also in
fact it comes in like a beautiful blush
pink
she'd look amazing oh my gosh I feel a
little bit like P Diddy when I wear it
on a staff you like really like baller
like pimp in Oh looking like that like
how good does that look and that color
is amazing I love it so much
yeah isn't it incredible but and also I
thought with the weather being so hot
yeah just get my arms free my dear
imagine this but yes and I tried it on
with the cute little flowers and some
like the trashy
I am you have and it suits you so much
as well well it does a bit different for
me and as soon as you anything that's
right yeah so I love that cannot wait to
wear that we like to on for having a
great time it's like I'm having a great
time okay right another another splurge
here and a bit right I'm getting so
comfortable that is a bit random for me
and it's these Gucci sandals now I you
do have to have stand-up pieces and I
was looking for gold sandals
specifically and I saw these in Gucci
and I was like could I do it could I
really do it definite tried them on and
I was like they were just beautiful on
and they were really flattering and
they're extremely comfortable because
they have a chunky heel and then it has
the beading at the pearl detail down the
front which should mean is just like a
gorgeous iconic yeah Gucci design and
there's no you know I can't wait to see
you in yeah I'd let you can't wait to
wear that and I think on your skin tone
this is just gonna look incredible I'm
so in love I love it I was saying to
Patricia she's also wear like really
golden highlight to kind of I think you
should please do like you should see
your gold highlight on I'm gonna be
still right there
I'll glow or green just maybe like
oh I'm so in love they're like must
pledge for the season I hope I can pull
it off I've got my wide leg and white
pants but I think I want to wear them
with that look at me with it I can't
wait to see that next piece thought I'd
go for some shoes too these are new pet
Ganga boots how cutely I mean you guys
probably know I'm a bit obsessed with
suede ankle boots that just cover a ball
you know I mean that kind of length I
remember from last year
the video from last year because you
have the a pair from Rhys that you love
like okay she loves it she genuinely
loves it I got those yeah I know and
that you love them and you wore them all
the time yeah and these are my Meadows
but they've got a little bit more extra
detail feel is really cool it's got this
kind of patterning on it in it's almost
like mosaic oh yeah very random but I
really really like it and the beautiful
like super black suede it's just so
sleek and elegant so you I love it I'm a
bit predictable aren't I really it's
laughing unless you know your style yeah
yeah I know this suits me yeah and it
elongate the leg
so I lot cannot cannot wait to wear
these with emigrate God is fabulous
okay finally I have a piece that I feel
is like super me and it's this long
knitted skirt from River Island and the
colors like my favorite kind of color
which is like you know oatmeal oatmeal
it's got this split detail down the side
as well so the able to see a little bit
of you know side leg and thigh and I
want to pair it with just like a
casualty and potentially the gold Hills
awesome boots and you know for me I love
river island because it's a really good
high sheet brand that just I don't know
I feel like the quality of the clothing
is always yeah always good always good
and I feel like meats are gonna be
really good this season and I always
feel comfortable I'm so excited about
knitwear this season loving it I've
already bought like three jumpers that I
can't even wear it is too hot right now
is crazy
that's gorgeous I think it's Beach I
love that shade I love it is it quite
high-waisted yeah slightly high waisted
and all it's also got this tie detail at
the fun almost like you're wearing a
jumper anyway that's exactly what it's
meant to do
that casual she that's a great piece
actually really great piece so my last
piece is a product I probably can't even
wear because it's so hot but I really
want to wear I'm gonna try and just wear
it for pictures just hope we're over
your show I will pretend snatch it give
it to Alex I like this this is a new
piece for March so this is a amazing
long camel coat a little bit obsessive
chemicals and a lot it's always good for
autumn another accent isn't it yeah but
this one is like lovely and long I mean
anything I mean it's like you look like
double breasted style and it's got great
structure so it's really kind of
stripped to anywhere lovely
got a great big I love colors it in the
hot I'm a bit about the collar cause Joe
it's just an amazing thing
I mean it's not exactly the most
inexpensive count coat like Zara pull is
about 150 this is really thick is it not
yeah yeah yeah I'll be wall it's just
amazing quality I love mashed a bit so
if you're after that more kind of
investment camel coat then great it's
great to go for that this kind of thing
if you want something a bit marketing
can you just this season I'd maybe go
time so I'll replace at that River
Island either Topshop have some
