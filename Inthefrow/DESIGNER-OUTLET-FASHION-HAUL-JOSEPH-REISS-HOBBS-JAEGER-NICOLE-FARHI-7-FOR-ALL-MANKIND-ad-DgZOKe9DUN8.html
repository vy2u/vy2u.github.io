you're all doing so so well and so
excited to film this video today's the
first outlet hall I've ever done in my
channel and I love doing hall so this is
going to be a pretty cool one to do we
not like spent a long a couple of weeks
ago to Jessa Oaks you may have seen it
on my Instagram or my snapchat all of
that so MacArthur Glen at Cheshire Oaks
it's in the Cheshire area it's like 45
minutes away from Manchester it's 30
minutes away from the Paul
through us game from London it's a
two-hour train drive and then like a 15
minute taxi so it's not that far at all
I mean I'm from Wigan originally so I
mean my mom used to obsession Oaks every
month or services ought to see what
bargains are out there so for anyone
that hasn't heard of an outlet mall
before or who hasn't heard of Cheshire
Oaks pretty much it's a huge shopping
area for everyone so you've got play
areas you've got restaurants and cafes
and there's so many different types of
shops from luxury to high streets which
is something there for everyone to kind
of enjoy Tricia Oaks is also the UK's
largest Designer Outlet so there is so
many things there to look at and the
idea is it kind of goes around the
circle you can just kind of keep walking
keep walking stop up a cafe stop off at
a restaurant carry on shopping karen
shopping jnanam needs to go all the
times click on free park and just go for
a big stroll around and shop all day
really but the coolest thing for me
about it is the fact that it has so many
shops I already love off the high street
or at discounted prices like some of the
prices I'm kind of up to 60% off so you
can get some like real bargains so we
have such a great day I also bumped into
a few of you which was awesome so hello
if you are watching so I'm going to get
into the whole my actual pick up but I
thought before I did that I just show
you a little few clips of what we got up
to in our day okay so we've just made
its Cheshire Oaks it was actually so
quick Ellie bill eyes how can I
some of the day there's so much on the
sea rhesus right here but Hobbs
Joseph is just down the way as well so
yeah let's just get shot
lovely blue my net and hops a little I
can and so Mike II throw on nice a
little keep the perky
you
just finished up in Jaeger got myself an
absolutely beautiful laser kind of
jacket like beautiful style really
beautiful and there's only one last size
left
amazing things I think we're doing
pretty well here
Jaeger so far hey Josie so spot mine
yes we have so much fun that day so let
me show you what we got I'm going to
start off with Hobbes which is one of my
kind of favorite high street kind of
operand high street stores anyway so I
was super excited to go in here and I
actually bought this jumper and I've
shown this a few times already on my
snapchat and quite a few of you were
like member from so this is from Hobbes
it's just a really lovely knit so it's
perfect with season stripes are always
in so perfect I'm also a big fan of Navy
and white together it's a really lovely
neckline right - but it feels really
beautiful it's really thick you're
keeping really warm for winter and it's
just a general length it just finishes
below the waistline it's just a lovely
easy jumper to throw on this jumper
walls 150-pound reduced to 46 pounds
amazing so yeah huge bargain absolutely
love there and also from 1/2 so I also
bought this necklace halibut that I mean
I know I don't usually go for such
chunky jewelry but I don't know I really
liked it I thought with a very simple
dress like something like it's a navy
plane dress which might be soon I just
thought it could be canonized so yes but
that put it's lovely
this was 29 pound but reduce to 19
pounds I'd like 10 pound off so it's
like 3rd off which is pretty great yeah
okay next up we went to Nicole Farhi
we do another kind of hanger end but
still High Street kind of brand and I
had seen this bag in the store some full
price I saw in Hampstead and really
totally fun with it and I saw this in
the outlet store and was like I have to
that how lovely is this bag is so
beautiful that color pastel kind of mint
duck egg blue it's got a really cool
clothing that this kind of opens here
like this and then it unzips and it's
got loads of room inside officers got
packaging right now loads of room inside
I mean there's no longer strap to it but
I thought just as I could keep a bowling
bag to Ann crook of your arm I just kind
of carry it's so beautiful and this was
originally for 95 reduced to 1 7 9 so I
mean what even is that it's about 70%
off think 6 % percent off so good I mean
burning - think about you're buying it's
full price I loved it that much and it's
now like 30 percent of that price so
brilliant I love how next up is all my
favorite stores Josie I love Joseph and
we buy everything from Joe back gosh I
love it and they found some gorgeous
things so some of you may smile it's
next piece in a recent Instagram so many
of you asked where it's from and I think
you can all wait until is that little
horse you can see so this jumper how
gorgeous is this I know it's really kind
of standard knit for this winter again
big chunky knits like this are gonna be
all the rage again as we always are
turtleneck I went in math till next
season please like that perfect funnel
neck so it'll just stay there very
structured it's super warm it's
wonderfully warm at the great Christmas
it's just perfect it's the perfect
winter net it really really is this
doesn't seem to have a tag in it or case
it's very lying but I've looked
everywhere and I cannot find tags or
receipt for these purchases heart
further but I've got a feeling that this
jumper was about 250 if not a bit more
reduced to about 150 I want to say it
had a pretty major reduction on it some
using the tag isn't in here but what's
the tag maybe I will now try it on a
lotta tag but by the way it had about
forty percent off it this jumper and
again from Joseph this dress I
absolutely love this is a Navy high
collar dress with some buttoning down
the front and it just goes into I'm
scared to dress like this it's just very
simple it's a lovely flat crepe fabric I
just really like anti neck so just fits
really nicely all around goes down into
a great kind of pretty sure it just
covers the knee so quite nice MIDI link
so would like tall boots even with some
stilettos or I've got a really cool pair
after your shoes I just bought go with
these quite high so yeah again this is
so hard to say for boss the receipt
these are about 100 pound juice from
about 200 pound again pretty
next up a 20-7 Fraulein kind which is my
favorite James Brown actually adore all
their genes have so many now I got some
pieces so first thing I saw just a very
kind of basic tee I saw this and the
quality of this is so beautiful and it's
so super soft it's just one of those
wonderful great t-shirt so you can wear
with any kind of jeans and boots and a
cool bag and I like a leather jacket and
just look really rock and roll chic and
cool so they're gonna go for it's so
soft can take your time is beautiful and
this was 70 pounds reduced 35 from the
outlet so pretty awesome and I got a new
pair of jeans which I love Rommels like
a bit petrol blue style kind of like
worn very cool toned blue no rips cuz
I've sewn your ripped jeans right now
for Sequoia from the rips but they just
fit me really really nicely they're just
kind of like a mid-rise mid rise Jean
always such amazing quality they just
fit me I think the musn't really like
saffron kinds because it fit me like
perfectly my origin and know which size
I always need like I always go for 25 in
a skip of skinnies and it fit so nicest
I've got those and they were 180 reduced
to 121 but I'm pretty sure that when I
was there there was like a promotion on
and they're actually reduced at 99 we
would 99 to from 180 that's at
half-price right then I went to Jaeger
this bags a little bit briefing back now
but I saw this jacket on the rails it
was the only one left
and it was in my size I felt like it was
cement a bit yeah boo cool jacket can
you see him nice up fabric is so this is
a wonderful Navy vehicle jacket these
are in cotton cotton sections down the
sides but next food cool fabric all over
otherwise and it's it up the middle how
pretty is this it's just so kind of
classic chic it's sort of very me at the
moment I felt like as soon as I brought
it back and showed answers that that is
a fair review look I think so too and
this was 250 reduced to 9999 pounds 250
she's really really good I had to get
that I love that so much and the final
thing I bought was from riche another
one my favorite brands and this was the
most expensive thing that I thought but
I also think one of the biggest bargains
back up it is this blue leather jacket
look at that color though is incredible
and again it's a few of these left I
just totally fell in love with it
and the leather on this is absolutely
incredible it just feels amazing and
this was 525 pounds reduced to 45 so
again it's like or it bags enough it's
so so good I bear little wear leather
jackets because I never really like the
ones that I have I don't think they suit
me very much but to try this on and I
feel like it's kind of thing that I can
throw on now with an easy pair black
jeans are dark blue jeans or white jeans
it was kind of at the edge to the outfit
it's just gorgeous
so couldn't leave without that as well
and that is everything that you picked
up I think I did pretty well I found
some pretty amazing bargains there I
mean there was so many other stores we
could have gone in these just the ones
that caught my eye and actually found
things in that really loved I mean they
also have a coach there they have a cost
they have a pillow Ralph Lauren Doc
Martens Karen Millen like there's so
many other places there we could be gone
but it's just such a really nice day out
and I mean that's why when everything is
your strokes always think of like really
nice day out with my mom and just go and
shopping and picking up some great
bargains so yeah I really really enjoy
putting this together for you I hope you
