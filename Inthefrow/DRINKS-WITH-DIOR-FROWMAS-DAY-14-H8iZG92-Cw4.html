pretty late now to be honest and I'm
literally just about to go out I'm going
to a meal with some amazing girls I know
so Sammy and also tomorrow we're going
for a meal with Dior that's going to be
having a fleeting rather glam so I'm
just wearing my self-portrait dress I
wore to Casper and Joe's premiere
because I love this dress and I thought
there's no way I'm only wearing it once
last few hours I've been frantically
editing and uploading Frommer's day
eleven twelve and thirteen so I hope
you've seen those and you enjoyed those
if you haven't watched those already and
you only just seen this video wondering
why I've missed three days out make sure
you go back and watch them they're only
quite short video so I won't take too
long I haven't really wanted much off
today cooks been been a bit of a non day
so I think I might have got a little bit
of breakfast I may have got a little bit
at the airport
so let's not to leave this place already
it's so beautiful here we should have a
few more days really but most expensive
soups ever but really delicious
so the few little clips are off today
otherwise I'm just getting ready go take
our minds you've aren't you back with me
and probably what shoes might wear my
black Jean Vito Rossi shoes as well so
off to the meals
it's actually the next day now I didn't
manage to vlog last night because when I
got back in from the meal
Alex is already asleep bless him so I
didn't want to make any noise realistic
Alex get ready to take off a makeup and
get in bed I had such a lovely meal last
night with Dior scene Tamar and Sammy I
love those two so much and also I got to
know Camila a little bit more as well
place was called sexy fish and he was
just in Mayfair absolutely delicious
so highly recommend therefore looking
for somewhere super nice to go to I'm
gonna end this vlog here before I start
the next vlog from here really hope you
enjoyed froma say 14 I will see you soon
and you're all really really well bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
