lovely kind of creamy white color and I
tooked it in these new they're kind of
like a lot so wild like trousers with

would just come back from taking some
pictures but I'm going back it down
again in a second I've just got this
around my waist is little waist belt and
I'm just wearing my new heels as well
with it and yeah so we're just gonna
head down now for some drinks
okay Nathan a champion for a little
while but it has been a lot of chatting
a lot getting to know different people
and it's been lovely we had a full
briefing on the new Continental GT
learning all about it oh my god I cannot
actually wait to show you tomorrow all
of the little tricks and things about
this car it's insane oh my god
whoa okay this is the cast I'm gonna be
driving today this is in the shade
extremely silver
it's almost got this like pearlescent
film for gold finish Crystal Light
a symbol so after Victoria slight panic
attack of first getting in the Bentley
how are you feeling right now oh my god
this is ridiculous
it's absolutely beautiful to drive would
you say it's the best car you've ever
drawn in your life maybe various beats
of course and that's for sure they might
a little a little tweaks and well things
like it reads it reads the signs for you
so now the car will tell me I can go 80
kilometers an hour can you see it on
that yeah oh and I can't see this
see that's normally like here it says it
right in front of me on the on the
window it says 80 okay me what I'm doing
it tells me how long the road ah it's
just oh it's so nice this this is insane
and we're driving through here so oh gee
watches who will remember a vlog from a
few years ago when we went to and place
called South Tirol we are actually close
to it now I think I want to live there
so much beautiful
stunning isn't it this is one of the
best days of my actual life no joke this
place sounds wealth out but mean Alex
love these kind of mountains Oh God
does this kind of terrain the
mountainside and the country and it's
absolutely amazing I don't the drought
it's in the suitcase in my suitcase no
in my suitcase
what's all right we've got Road after
this we could maybe do it on Luger -
it's straight to Venice though you're
gonna have to ask them and say can you
leave the suitcase at the next stop I
mean I like something's kind of terrain
it's like the mountains the water like
you hear that river guitar my god stop
you
this road is ridiculous it's beautiful
wide roads barely around it's just
insane although gotted Alex doesn't have
his drone in his camera guide so I don't
get the drone shots here which is shame
but absolutely amazing look at this
display though absolutely beautiful this
woman is keeping us very much on track
she is fabulous seven little pits done
because we saw this view
this is amazing how beautiful
they've been stirred up so much in my
life I was like why is this young girl
it looks 16 driving a Bentley I got a
floor after sit in it bless em inside
this is beautiful connected to anything
yes we can it's so nice ah amazing guys
I'm having the best time
we just stopped it's really really
pretty it's like a restaurant thing
after finally this is everyone for the
trip
cherlene on the field this blue like
burnt orange and it's like gray silver I
think this might be my favorite is this
the peacock blue one yes it is this
one's my favorite peacock blue this is
really nice it's like a sky blue and
then this one's like her dark grey
charcoal not their dark grey our one is
like this pearlescent Goldie's silver
silver
it almost looks a bit like e it's so 450
kilometers how many miles is that
300 something we've done 22.9 to the
gallon I'm now in the backseat because I
got a little bit tired so David drove
for us very happy about it
we have arrived back at the Kempinski
Hotel for anyone who watches the vlogs
from my last August something wasn't it
we were here with Tamara and Emilia for
the Venice Film Festival wishes jela
cute and we stayed here and it's beyond
amazing hotel so it's very nice to be
back
Irene is 185 it's a suite and we kept
following the sounds we're walking and
walking and walking and couldn't find it
we asked two members of staff find the
second member of staff knew where to
bring us through all the staff area I
don't know how we managed to get so lost
anyway well you know and it's absolutely
insane I think it's this is not the
Marco something sent with Marco Polo
suite but look at this view guys we're
literally right on the water
interiors are beautiful right we now
have less than five minutes to get ready
because we took 20 minutes Fanning area
good morning beautiful people welcome to
our last day in Venice and our last
morning yes
this is extremely perilous this is a
very very nice of this this view out
here of Venice on this little gondola
going past Oh No before we took off
I'm start to have a mini breakdown
someone else in the garage I was like I
asked you to drive this car for me would
you he's like well no yes someone about
it and it's like I'm sorry I can't I've
got to go down to the car
come on so I did really want to drive it
I mean that that particular spec of car
was 200,000 and I thought if I if I
crush this then we die or if I crash
this then make sure it's crazy or I
crash this and this is a really really
bad thing baby
that's like freak out but as soon as
I've got going with it because because
I've never driven automatic either but
every Bentley is automatic that's just
the thing to get used to this it'll be
absolutely fine as soon as I did it was
amazing
with one close scab when it told us to
go tiny little Italian ro and scratch
the side of the moon he made one wrong
turn it was a right turn and apparently
you turn yeah but according to an the
guys everyone else has done that
everybody said yeah no I mean I'm an
every trip every trip is good enough so
it's obviously like a very missable turn
I think somebody scratched on that as
well yeah so what else scratched it do
we can no way we can fit in the car with
screaming at me and it's got this really
cool thing work it has a camera on the
front of the back and on the sides and
the wing there's and then it's stitches
as you can tell my camera VL abolished
up and it stitches all the all the
footage together so you get like a
complete 360-degree view as we were
going through that it was just like this
fuller because it was just looking at
all the walls this tiny tiny gap luckily
managed it like the other end of that
most all for you to do whenever anyway
the journey was perfect
that was literally like an experience
I'll never forget
nothing that's these guys to say that
it's kind of thing it will be sad with
our grandkids but we went from Austria I
mean honestly it's the cool another
story if I if I get to the point where I
can finance or buy one of those cars I'm
on it's so amazing I've never seen that
craftsmanship like it cuz I was seen
it's a bit like those ladies how the
dream in terms of if you look back the
dream is to buy an ER nurse bag I said
mister while I see if I don't know
about time and it's like you get to
create bespoke customized special
one-of-a-kind bag that's why an S is so
expensive but the Bentley everything in
it has been active that is the main but
they've got like thousands of people in
the factories making it open Manchester
doing every single stitch on the
diamonds and everything is just so
haven't done it's litter like a luxury
piece of luxury toy so that's cool yeah
so we're gonna have breakfast and then
head back to the air we have come
tomorrow like five hours
mm-hmm Rica oh you've enjoyed the vlog
guys have a little look around a new
Bentley
don't leave do you tell them without if
you're going look at the new car my new
engine luxury sports cars and you want
something light amazing I'll leave
darlings and things down below we can go
and speak to people about about the cars
