all really really well it's about time I
did a favorites video I think I miss
November ow
it just got a little bit busy so many
things are going on and time just kind
of got away with me so it didn't get
done so instead I'm going to do a bit of
a November and December favorites mix it
all up a little bit to be fair there's
not much difference anyway between the
two months so it's not going to be a bad
interpretation of what exactly I did
like so I guess it's just gonna maybe be
a little bit longer than usual but
hopefully I can keep it nice and short
and sweet it might start itself with
beauty products as we usually do okay
first things first this cleanser at the
door it's Sarah Chapman skin assists
ultimate cleanse I've been using this
every single night in every single
morning it's quite a thick gel I work it
over the top of my makeup to break it
down then I'll either use an exfoliating
brush or a synthetic exfoliating brush
just to work it really into the skin and
almost vibrates and brushes out all the
makeup as well but it helps to mix it
through then I use a dump cleansing
cloth to wipe away everything my skin
just feels so clean and fresh it feels
so so nice so this I've really really
been loving for that I'm gonna class
this is beauty although it's not
necessarily something I'm using on my
face or anything it's a liquid blender
cleanser this is so good if you use
Beauty sponges or the Beauty blunder
like I do this is brilliant all you do
is just open at the top and you push
down on this dispersive product so you
can put your sponge in it disperse it
down it'll put some cleanser into your
sponge then with some water
you just really kind of work it into a
lather and it pulls all of the kind of
makeup and anything else out your sponge
and makes it super clean so it needs
this after I've used my Muji sponges
just give them a really good clean and
cleanse keep them nice and fresh but
it's just a really easy product to use
handy I can have it my bathroom ready
for me just to kind of wipe through all
of my sponges before I use them again
yeah I thought you guys might like to
know about this because I know a lot of
people in the past have asked me how I
clean my sponges so this is my new
secret weapon I'm going to do a full
nighttime routine that you know really
really soon because I've been meaning to
do one and my evening routine right now
is on point and we'll say I'm really
getting into having a full-on evening
routine there are so many products now
and this is one of them ever since I
started getting shellac still looks like
at the moment loving it so much I've
mentioned it a few times down videos but
this is my favorite one that I've had so
far from dry buy but since I've been
getting them obviously you need to keep
care of your cuticles and keep them
looking amazing so I've been using this
every single night
it's a Margaret Dobbs nail and cuticle
serum I just put a little bit on 2/3 of
my nails they with my other thing as I
work it into each nail you only need to
look you need three amounts I find to
work in they'll do it on the hand I've
also started putting it on my toes as
well now so they don't get dry it's also
on my cuticles they're really nice so
I'll use this and then I use a hand
cream and the differences I've made was
massive I could tell within one night of
just using this because usually my nails
get really dry around the edges and they
stop splitting and I get the kind of
bits of skin that almost look like this
been cut it doesn't look very attractive
so ever since I started using this I
just have the completely clear and clean
nails that just look so much better so
the loving the so so much this month
favorite perfume of the month is without
a doubt this one from Maison Martin
Margiela this is part of their replicas
range and when I heard about this I've
totally fell in love with it
the whole concept it's just so unique so
the idea is that it's called replicas
and they're meant to replicate sense
that can evoke memories from your past
or potentially from your past anyway I
think they've got they've got quite a
lot of scent in this range and surely
was for about 20 or so they're all from
different memory like potential memories
that you've had so for example this one
is Beach walk and he's get them
customized so - beach walk from in the
Maldives
2015
you know I went for multi isn't it with
incredible fragrance subscription
Sunkist salty skin and style description
for in the fro so you can have these
customized so these are so good as a
gift as well I just love the whole idea
that you can have this kind of bottle of
a memory and it replicates that memory
whenever you smell it so for me whenever
I smell this it does just remind me of
holidays and it does just remind me of
like a beach walk and kind of just walk
along on holiday but if some going down
and seal happen o of your feet this is
my favorite one Beach walk but they have
one that's like a jazz club for guys
it's kind of like I'm sure it says like
heady cigars and whiskey or something
like that and it just smells kind of
like that attractive man smell oh
there's like a fairground one that's a
bit more candy sweet I'm sure it's like
a fresh bed linen kind of smell that
reminds even late I'm sure it's a lazy
Sunday morning or something but look at
this range it's so cool I'm pretty sure
they're sold in Selfridges I'm totally a
lot of it now female beauty mitts to
mention the lorac Pro contour palette
I've used this recently a tutorial a lot
of you are like oh my god it's really
really good and I love it to bits I was
really looking forward to finding
something that could rival the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour palette and this
definitely does I think I love this more
and must say pigmentation is slightly
stronger I feel especially the yellow
highlight when I use out for powdering
it powders and it really kind of helps
to mattify those areas as well and it
really takes away all shine which I
really like about it whereas I felt like
the Anastasia one didn't quite take away
as much as maybe I would have liked
contour shades as well are really really
great
sometimes the contour palette the shades
and them a potentially too dark I'm not
going to be right for the wrap for ever
on skin tone whereas I feel these could
really really work they're not to
oranjee and they're also not to dirty
muddy and the fact it has a mirror as
well is a massive bonus you can get this
online for all of us that are in the UK
that aren't in the US and can't get this
from Ulta nor from sell it online if you
really want it I would say
get it from Nordstrom online I'll leave
the link down below get this and if you
want to make it come a bit more
worthwhile they could also maybe back to
lorac Pro palette as well for eyes which
is my favorite eyeshadow palette and
then it means that you're not paying
quite as much shipping per per product
of them because it cost about 15 pounds
shipping but this is so worth it when
this is run out I will be buying another
it's that good eat she's wrong she liner
catcher eyeliner is my current favorite
it's got such a long nib it's so easy
for drawing cat I almost the fat the nib
is shaped like this you can just almost
place on draw it off and it will draw on
your cat eye so easy I used it in a
recent tutorial if you'd like to go and
have a look at how any of this is it
really is a fantastic product big big
recommendation deficits month for lips
and rather in love with this by Burberry
this is a Burberry rose wood rosewood
little definer I love the fact these
Burberry lip pencils are square free
start there aren't many pencils like
this that are complete the square
I really like that and the shade is a
really wonderful nudey pink how this
used on me when I did my Burberry video
and I really loved how soft and natural
and neutral it was it was just a very
it's kind of I feel this lip liners for
the girl it's on the go it's just off to
work just quickly lots of draw on the
liner fill in add a little bit of a
gloss or something on the top and
they're good to go and they look amazing
all day I kind of wish that that would
be me so that's why I kind of keep using
this in hopes that I'll look that way to
be honest I feel this could be amazing
over the top of that I love the
packaging of ghulam I say Galan
apparently might be also ghilane either
way I'm just going to call it Galan
because I really like it like that the
packaging of these products is stunning
probably go as far as saying this is my
favorite brand packaging this gloss it's
called the glass definer what shade is
it in 472 but it's really beautiful baby
pink shade like nothing too drastic on
the lips nothing too over the pigmented
but it does leave you with a really
pretty
sheen and a gloss and at the same time
he could also wear this as a bomb
I spent leads that Galan are saying do
you have a really good bomb and they
said we don't have a bomb as such but
this would definitely work as a bomb
while so give him that high shine and I
totally agree
went up and in my office I've had this
next to me on my desk I'm gonna ply and
get throughout the day my lips don't get
dry but they look so plumped and shiny
and pretty and that's really love it for
that reason I think it's that perfect
baby pink gloss shade that I've always
been searching for so this is it like I
said I think that this is a lip liner
with this silver top just looks gorgeous
and last thing that's technically beauty
is this and I have got this bag dirty
it's the jhj large barrel I'm not sure
it's cold but this isn't neat this is
the Arctic set so it comes in the back
which how does it keep it safe and then
this is the barrel you may have seen I
use this for my gleam Christmas party
for my hair for that and it just gave me
some really beautiful curls so I'm
totally totally smitten with this now
and the next few things are a bit random
first up is this beautiful necklace this
is from an Icelandic brand called album
I think that's how you say it but I just
love silver jewellery as you probably
already know I mean I've been wearing a
little bit more rose gold recently but
silver has always been my thing and this
is just so me it's simple it's delicate
and it's elegant and it's also a really
great length sort of sort of sits here
around your collarbone I just had to
mention it really it's by far my
favorite necklace off the month think
it's gorgeous next thing is a little bit
random but it's the happy plug speaker
so I'm really enjoying coming it playing
on my desk as I've been working and it
disconnects so easy to fo turn it on
sound booth ready to go
pairing divine device connected already
connected and then all I have to do is
just go on to Spotify and play whatever
you want at the moment
constant listen to the royalty album by
Chris Brown but the sound is really
really good and also the cool thing
about this is that you can change the
colors so there's loads of different
those different grips that you can put
here in different colors and its really
look turquoise is my favorite color it's
like that it's um
the next favorite has to be this
burberry scarf I've mentioned it's quite
a lot recently and it's been in a lot of
my blog posts but I just haven't taken
it off since I got it to be honest the
fact it's monogrammed just makes it
really really special it's got my
initials on it and it just seems to go
with everything that I've been wearing
so every jacket I've just literally
throw it on around my jacket and go no
again I'll just sort of rough my hair in
it and you know it's not much else to
say about a scarf about for me to really
really love it by far a favorite this
month this beautiful fabric Burberry
it's beautiful and my last favorite of
this month has to be my new handbag
which is the Givenchy
Antigona in deep blue so it's like a
navy I'm going to be doing it what's in
my handbag video really soon so don't
want to talk too much about it but I'm
totally smitten with this bag it's by
far being my favorite thing that I
thought so I had to mention it and tell
you about it but yes what's in my bag is
coming very very very soon I think
that's it guys and then there wasn't
much there and it's quite beautiful
there hasn't been many things in fashion
that I've really really loved that I
haven't already mentioned yeah I really
hope you enjoyed that if you did make
sure to give it a like I'm sorry it was
late next time it'll beat and watch more
on time I promise
I hope you're all doing really really
well I look forward to seeing you guys
soon and take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
