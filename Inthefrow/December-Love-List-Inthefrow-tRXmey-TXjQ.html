really really good welcome to the
December love list I've been trying to
kind of film these with people as a
roulette the idea of having them as kind
of a collaborative video it turns out
I've run out of time for the end of the
year therefore this assemble of list is
just me I'm afraid I hope that's all
good but as always I have like ten
things to go through and all my personal
favorites of this month so let's get
started first thing is the favorite
thing that I watched this month that
would easily have to be Star Wars I went
to the premiere in Leicester Square
which was incredible all the cast came
into the theater and said hello JJ
Abrams off said I hope you enjoy the
film and talk through all the cast in it
was pretty mind-blowing I've always been
the star wars fan because I have an
older brother he used to watch Star Wars
all the time and therefore i'd watch it
with him so Star Wars is something I
have watched over and over over and over
especially the original three films I
know those films pretty well so when
this came out I was very very excited to
see it so it's definitely worth a watch
next up is my favorite picture of the
month favorite thing that I thought
instagrammed and that easily have to be
this one I'll put here and this is a
picture of me Sammy Lydia Lucy Carly
Jason and early on at the gleam
Christmas party we were in cali in
Leon's room right before going out and
having some champagne and miss chattin
and getting ready finishing touches to
our outfits before I went off and it was
just so funny then we all got in the
bath for a picture and then Carly turn
the tap on and got our entire dress wet
and it was just so much from that night
it was such a good evening with all of
my really really good friends definitely
an event I won't forget very soon it's
so good who I loved this month this
month I'm going to go with Suzie because
I haven't listed her before and she's
always been like top of the list to
mention someone who I just love every
single month CZ is a good friend of mine
I met her through blogging she's got an
incredible blog and she also has a
brilliant youtube channel so I'll leave
her link below for you to check her out
if you don't already follow her she's a
really good friend of mine she's
genuinely
person she's feel happy so friendly
she's always there always texting me and
checking everything is all right if I'm
having a bad day she's just an awesome
person so definitely my favorite person
of the month ok so the favorite thing
that I wore this month I would probably
say it would be my sweaty Betty jacket
that I was skiing I put picture here of
it it was so perfect what I mean it for
it was a gorgeous jacket it was so well
fitted it was so flattering it was super
cute the fur on the collar faux fur
around the collar it's a really good
piece to have with me so I definitely
said that was a favorite thing I wore
this month the favorite thing that I did
this month and how I spent my time I
would say would be in France when I went
skiing I'm sure if any of you watch my
fro miss vlogs you will see that i went
to france to morzine and to the of oreos
slopes with Carly and Leon and few of
the journalists and bloggers and it was
so much fun it was just such a brilliant
way to end the year off it was my last
trip of the year and also one of the
best it was so much fun on my snowboard
and ski died about the snowboarding
accident I mean Carl I realized
snowboarding definitely wasn't thrills
and we were definitely scares and it was
just a really good time to kind of
bombed or two of our really really good
friends so yeah definitely my fav
favorite things that I ate this month I
would have to say most memorable food
experience of this month has to be in
the chalet in France because I Shelley
was staying in was one of those chalets
that you can rent out as lots of couples
or groups as a group and you have an
in-house chef so you literally have a
chef with you all times he makes a
breakfast and your dinner and this
particular chef is called down he was so
brilliant who yall sat down like all of
my other bloggers and other journalists
SAT around waiting for the food and what
came out was just incredible the food
was just insane favorite drink of the
month I have been lapping up the
Christmas who drinks this year big time
and by Christmas he drinks I mean the
alcoholic drinks we have a bottle of
port if I have to bottle support in at
the moment and we're going through those
pretty nicely that and I've also got a
bottle of mosca as well which is like
it's a sweet dessert wine which I
absolutely adore what port every year
when it comes like November and in
November to December I
get myself a bottle of like tawny port
and we have like these little crystal
glasses may have like little shots of
them like nut shots but we have like
little glasses of them each night and I
often have one by my desk just to get it
simple I mean I don't know when I became
50 already but you know the favorite
event or occasion this month there have
been a lot so as well as skiing that I
said already loved and the gleam party
which was amazing another really good
trip that I went on was to Germany with
vauxhall so you may have seen if you
follow my blog you may have seen that
they are running in competition at the
moment we can win a car and I'm working
with them on their campaign so I'm so
proud that I get the chance to work with
him on this because it's a pretty huge
campaign and kind of like the UK
ambassador for it again you may see it
in frame with logs that I went away to
Germany did all that and it was just
really really good fun i have got to
drive the car around a track and they
had driver drive me around like really
really quickly on this like wet track
and just feel so proud that i get to be
part of this campaign next year part of
the end of this year and next year like
it's really exciting so you may see some
adverts come out soon with me in it for
foxhole should definitely enter i leave
a link down below we enter as well it's
super easy all you have to do is
customize a car enter into competition
and get people to vote for it and
highest voted ones could potentially be
the winning one so it's really really
easy and you just get to design a car so
it's pretty fun yeah so that was easily
one of the best things i did this month
and it's very very proud I suppose this
it's a good way to end the year oki
favorite thing I heard this month
favorite song would have to be the brand
new Chris Brown album I'm obsessed
already i'm pretty sure it's called
royalty it's brand new album I've been
waiting for this for ages merely soon
Lydia keep texin about it talk about
like our favorite songs my favorite
songs have to be back to sleep I mean 0
was a favorite i mean i love that
buffett overheard it probably now
nofilter day one yeah there were so many
good songs in this album I loved it and
just a big Chris Brown fan and the last
thing is the favorite thing that I used
and I would have to say it would be this
from ghd which is actually my favorite
to the month as well but this is
an amazing barrel if you like large open
curls then you probably would love this
it heats up super fast comes in this
really nice white case as well to hold
it inserts rather lovely so that's
definitely stands out with something
that I use this month that I really
really loved and that is the end of my
love life everything for December and
we're back soon with the January
loveless and hopefully with someone with
me to talk about their famous the month
