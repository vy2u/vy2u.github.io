the pleasure of introducing Sammy Butte
crush to my channel that the first time
which is so exciting me because I'm a
huge huge fan of Sonic channel and
always have you do a bit of a video
about our desert island beauty
essentials kind of had this idea but
it's always nice to see what YouTube is
an bloggers really really low not really
live without coz I know we love a lot of
products but there's some things that I
will always be back to always repurchase
yeah exactly
so I thought it would be kind of an idea
of we've been part of desert island I've
got a bag of beauty products and what
would we hope was in that bag of beauty
products we've got together 7 of our
favorite products yes we're going to go
through them talk about why we love them
and why would need them do you wanna go
first ok so my first thing is a
hydrating serum because I love serums
recently you're saying yeah so my skin
is kind of combination oily but then
it-it's dehydrated so I it's just great
to have a lovely hydrating one and this
isn't too expensive it's Vichy at Ko
Olina thermal serum I really really
recommend it as amazing I've never seen
that look it's so nice and I love the
packaging as well really lightweight on
the skin gorgeous do you wear that at
night or in the morning both that shows
yeah yeah I mean I would both it's not
too thick even if your skin is oily it's
just lovely it sounds amazing right now
ok so my first one I've got a similar
line of what you said most people will
not be surprised I go on about this
product so much in like every video it's
a regen cream I know I know you're
uploading really sick of this now but it
really is so good it's a moisturizer I
can use day and night it's great for
problem skin it's great for forgot
blemishes or if your skin's feeling
really dehydrated it's such a good boost
and it's just like an ordinary cream you
know it's just yeah it's just kind of
like a really really skin carry fresher
it's a Mel it just smells like it feels
good I love it and it's so cheap you can
yeah you can get it from Aldi home
bargains after and it's like I love it
that's kind of thing I would always want
with me hopefully yeah ok my next thing
is hair related and I don't talk about
her plaits that much because there's not
that many I love but for my cup when my
hair's curly like this I have to have a
curl defining cream or something to to
stop it from getting too frizzy and I
love this this is my toy specific
moisturizing styling cream with quinoa
oil and rice wax that's the first time
I've heard that it's not the best not ok
you know yeah I like just fresh and
clean yeah exactly yeah quite
lightweight for the hair because I hate
sticky products in the hair yep and if
you've got curly hair I really recommend
it Oh perfect I love you next and again
I'm probably so born in this video I
love this too can't live without me at
all so many people ask me how do I keep
my colored hair in such a good condition
and it is literally down to this
I just put like 10 pence pay amount into
my hands rub it through all of my ends
not through the rest of your hair
because it can get me greasy but on the
ends of your hair it is a lifesaver
it just really nourishes and hydrates
and then when you come to dry in it
they're just so much smoother yeah after
I love it good I love because I use it
sometimes on dry hair or wet hair yeah
and I love this size of the bottle
because it's really easy to travel with
yeah these are typically you can get the
bigger ones and the bigger one is about
30 pound which is quite pricey but it
lasts you forever unless so long but for
traveling these little ones are perfect
like I took this when I went traveling
around America for 11 weeks at one of
these and it was so handy I love that my
next thing I'll go with eyes
I'm obsessed with wings liner I just
can't not wear wings I know I so this is
my favorite liquid liner and naturally I
wasn't even score up because I would
actually leave that I would wear this
and not mascara that's how much I love
winged liner so yeah the L'Oreal super
liner in black liquor reject black color
it stays on for ages I find it really
easy to use and to apply it just has
this kind of like oh yeah move yes
lovely
so yeah inexpensive and my love oh okay
well I was really boring and it put much
makeup but the one thing I suppose I do
have is a lip balm and I'm gonna try
this yeah well is it really good yeah it
is actually this is a blistex a lot of
this it's very kind of no I like that
though that kind of Trillian strong
stuff I mean either blistex or Carmack's
I can't go wrong with I wear every
single night before bed I always have
one in my purse ready for any kind of
opportunity go on because I have spines
that I need them all strong stuff flying
bits so we really get my lips like
normal because I have really really
chapped lips a lot and it always does
take these big guns so blistex like our
neck still really get it back to life my
lips thing is okay red lips yeah I just
know as much as I love winged liner I
love red lips and I just think that
having rare de lips it gives me so much
confidence as well when I put it on or
any bold lip I just love bold colors as
well so at its sample I usually always
also use the Mac Mac's Russian red which
is my all-time space but I recently
discovered nas Cruella Matt slim pencil
and its really really good quite a close
color match to Russian red as well
it's a consistently nicer if they're not
drying I prefer to some red for
longevity right but this is good for
traveling and if you don't want if
you're kind of scared of Russian red
smearing and stuff right this is also
matte but more map
so it means it's not yeah it does not
make any sense yeah no I love bird lips
as well definitely yeah
but I'm so torn when I was to use my
sensual so there are honestly I have
lots of essential makeup things but I
guess I've got more skin caring it's
good I love it yeah make everything I do
have some eyelash curlers again I go on
about it so much but I got the
straightest eyelashes ever they're so
straight I find that if I'm applying
mascara or anything else my own age I
have to kill my artists face and I just
think it's the one thing that every
woman should always do curl the
eyelashes please from Shu Uemura are
definitely best I try yeah that's so
good sayo the many different times and
these are by far the best they hold the
curl so well the kale stays all day
especially you've got some waterproof
mascara on after it yeah so yeah as
careless all the way and they're really
comfortable to use it yeah they don't
easily cut your skin which really hurt
yeah the are not calm meow my next thing
also kind of related to lashes oh not
kind of it is a mascara I think just
mascara in general just yeah it's like a
woman's thing that you have to open
through relation yeah so the one that
I'm using at the moment is the DJ the
utilizers volume lash and I saw there's
some liberties and picked it up because
it said it was supposed to be this
amazing like really popular mascara I do
really like it I prefer I have my
favorites more than this if that makes
sense yeah um but if you can see the
brush there but that's really I like it
yeah it's a really long one and it
really grabs your lash as well it's
really good for thickening
not as good for lengthening but good for
volume and thickening I know that's what
I thought because I haven't seen it
around much I just wanted to get it
right
Rose out isn't it yeah finally beauty
gems doing that next one for me again
it's more skin carry but the hammer
chemistry hand cream it's a 24% active
complex it's the only one with the blue
bottle I think but I just find this is
the most insane hand cream ever
it almost feels looks like it's clear at
distress on the floor no I haven't
mas feels like a serum gel so when you
rub it together yeah literally it hands
feel it's light throw hydrate yeah no
literally it just feels like houses so
convinced it smells so fresh it just
doesn't know what is that
it's so nice oh I don't know my little
every night
it's like clean cotton almost yeah it's
really nice yes it's beautiful
so I put this on every night before bed
I've done all my face makeup and
skincare makeup I put my hand cream on
and I never missed a step we can
actually love it so much I already have
another bottle ready to use for violet
color
Selfridges and Liberty and where's the
other place is it expensive
it's about 20 pounds I think it's worth
it though okay a good hand cream I've
tried so many hand creams as well and
they've made me not a hand cream person
because there's less sticky light and I
but that's really lovely yeah it was
just like velvet yeah yeah I love it
yeah that's going for I will always
continue buying I think and I love this
one the next thing is foundation I just
can't live without foundation I went
with this over concealer as well just an
idea I use this one as well yeah so yeah
this is not shaped like I've spoken
about this so many times um and I just
don't want to go on about it again and
again but kind of medium buildable
coverage gives your skin like a kind of
healthy and a pink glow yeah and I think
they do really good color colors as well
and color matches because they're quite
I think they're quite yellow toned yeah
which is really good
and let just blends in lovely and yeah
it's Peter what color you have yours in
in the moment I'm Barcelona in the
summer I'm Syracuse oh really wave names
yeah I'm in Deauville as well anyone
that is interested in yeah I I
absolutely love that foundation as well
I'd say I'm that one of Laura Mercier
sort cream I'll just either you know
what you're not there's not
I don't know Joyce a most beautiful yeah
everyone and I'm gonna go with this one
flower bomb from Victor and Ralph I
absolutely love this perfume I've worn
it for years and years and I do also
like the original more pink bottle but I
find that the purple bottle is just a
bit more intense and a bit more richer
and it's just a beautiful beautiful
perfume so I love this and yeah I know
you're right desert island but I still
wanna smell finishing touch isn't it -
yeah videos yeah and I'm like for how
you feel and it's just yeah it does it's
basically Miss Mary in it and I've also
got a perfume this one is quite
different to that one actually it's one
of a kind of a quite of a contour this
is the quarterly no sorry Pat parfum de
Vin de ver English perfume divine I
think oh sorry from cordially and this
is really hard to explain but it's kind
of more oh it's fresh it's beautiful
it's just it's really fresh and kind of
spa read yeah my Safari eye sweet in a
way yeah yeah kind of like a soft way
really unique I think just go and give
it a sniff if you can yeah but a lovely
one for one I don't want a really heavy
perfume because I mixed perfumes up all
the time but when I just want something
light and lovely I'll just make just
very pretty isn't it right
just like you said it's nice to finish
off everything with a nice scent and
last one for me my favorite one is the
tangle teezer
I think I've got about four tangle
teezer is now yes we just gets out all
the knots and tangles so much easier
than other brushes because I thought I
got thought into these when I was going
through a really bad time hair and it
was thought loads when my hair was
coming out I was like oh God so
got this and just found it was perfect
so and it also for me kind of I feel
like it volumizes my hair a bit yeah cuz
I used to use this I've used it as much
with the Kodiaks I feel I could get
stuck right
but I did you see use it and like it's
great for extensions as well yeah yeah
it's just really smooth and the mouth ya
know it's really you think yeah so this
