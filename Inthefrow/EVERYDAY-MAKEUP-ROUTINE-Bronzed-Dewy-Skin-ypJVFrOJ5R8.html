everyday makeup routine I asked you guys
on my snapchat I am in the fur on
snapchat if you don't already follow me
if I asked you guys if you wanted to see
my everyday makeup routine I've been
doing on snapchat I've been doing on
Instagram everywhere that you see in the
picture of me I've been doing the same
makeup for about two months and I asked
you guys to let me know if you liked it
and you want to see my full kind of new
everyday makeup routine and so many of
you said that you did so this is kind of
for you guys so if you would like to see
what I do every single day for my
everyday makeup then just keep on
watching oldie but a goodie starting off
the lush million dollar moisturizer
because as always it's just that perfect
illuminating base and it's super
moisturizing it smells amazing
now in honestly I've been tanning a lot
recently which means my foundations have
been changing ever so slightly
for example the maestro glow by armani
still like my absolute favorite but it
depends how light i am at the moment
i've not got much ton on so i've been
slightly mixing it with the infallible
l'oreal infallible 24 hour sometimes a
mix with charlotte tilbury sometimes a
mixed with tarte amazonian plate pens on
the day tears number two okay and with
that I'm just going to use a damp Beauty
Blender so this you see Beauty Blender
to dab this all over my face because
it's find it distributes the product
quite naturally and flawlessly
it was such a lovely Juhi luminous
finish while concealing and back to the
macro from prime but this time I'm using
the medium shade which is actually quite
a light shade I find I mean I love light
boost as well cuz it's more yellow toned
but I never really explored the other
shades they do and this is so perfect
for me
and again with the damp Beauty Blender
that's going to dab that in so my
favorite thing in the world right now is
this palette it's the iconic London
palette and inside it has six shades all
very well used because I just love this
thing to pieces
it's got highlight banana color a mock
concealer shade and then these two I
don't really use because they're quite
dark for me but this one in the middle
is like my contour shade so what I like
to do now take a little bit of banana a
little bit if I can see the shade onto
my damp Beauty Blender and I'll just
thought stop patting in underneath my
eyes this is a bit of extra concealing I
almost use these colors almost is like
part foundation because like pack it on
everywhere and it's such an easy product
to use and then I also like to take the
bottom of the Beauty Blender and I'll
dip into this more highlight shade and
then I'll just Dow a little bit of this
onto my cheek bone and because my face
is quite illuminated right now it
because we've been using a lot of Korean
products it's easy to see this almost
Julie glow along my cheekbone so just
follow that and add a little bit more so
now my favorite bit is contouring with
this middle shade and I'm going to use
my Real Techniques blending sponge this
time so I'm just patting into there put
a little bit off on your hand to see now
how much product you've got and now
let's just follow the natural shadow of
my cheekbone
trying to keep the sponge on the side so
it kind of creates this come to a line
it's super easy
and then on to the sides my forehead
will melt the edges a little bit just
make sure everything is blended and
really perfect going to move in to it
powder is for my under eyes using the
rodeo banana powder and the Armani
powder brush I think this one is so I
like to powder my chin my under eyes my
eyelids the end of my nose and the crook
of my nose here what meets my forehead a
little bit for it we write everything
down the center the rest of the base I'm
going to go with the Clarins this is a
limited edition bronzing blush compact
for summer but it's just beautiful like
bronzer it's got the blush in the center
if you like that I like to sort of go
around the very edge this is with the
Armani face brush I think and all I do
with this is just add a little bit of
the powder on to where we've bronzed I
almost find it sets that a little bit
better and just adds a little bit more
color but overall it does enhances a
bronze and I'll build that down my
cheeks and down to my neck finish off my
cheeks when you use a L'Oreal True Match
highlight and pretty short enough be out
now if not I'll be out so soon
this is the rosy shade rosy glow it's
very pretty
highlight shade but I just like to use
the pinky tones here and I work those
onto my cheeks
so this is actually a highlight it's not
really a blush but I like to use it it's
a very bright blush then what I'll do is
how to take the same brush or I'd use
like a taper brush and I go more into
the white and I'll just pop a bit of
that onto my berry tops of my cheeks
and a little bit into my brow and my
Cupid's bow okay so that is the base
dawn it's just very bright and Joey and
radium but that is what you have been
loving it every single day it's summer
my hair is - I just take it out it's all
good but nearly kind of cling to at the
end right so in terms of eyeshadow I'm
really into the whole like aroma so look
using your bronzer as your eyeshadow is
just the easiest way and the simplest
way of getting an eyeshadow shade but
I'm really enjoying this one because
it's got quite an orangey tone
especially if you kind of mix everything
together so I'm just literally use this
right into the crease like this could
not be any simpler but I'm just it's
just my quick everyday routine a little
bit onto the under eyes just it all kind
of works in together
also you should take a look at my darker
color and I'll work that a little bit
mines apiece it's just it's just a big
blending game really but then what I
like to take is this palette by Dior
which is the era fiber backstage Pro
palette looks something like these which
is very pretty some days I will just use
this brown shade as well mix it up and
take the Sigma e-40 blending brush with
this cream this cream is the perfect
brow bone shade so I literally use it on
my brow bone
I'll also using it to blend out the very
top of the eyeshadow
blends out really nicely and then four
little pipe in a corner highlight i go
with the l'oreal color riche la palette
nude in the rosy the rose shade and as
always i take this lovely light color on
the brush it comes with that never
happens usually but i love it and i just
pop that into marina corners and that
generally is like met everyday eyes it's
literally that simple now and again
though i will mix it up instead go with
this shade from the hourglass ambient
lighting powder or a little bit over the
top this is just a little bit more
shimmery and glowy
so obviously you don't need to do this
step but if you've got little bit more
time i'll just add a little bit more
shade very similar shades it's a little
bit more shimmery to finish off the eyes
first i'm going to go with those do some
mascara at the moment I've got a lash
lifts and my lashes are so much better
but it's going to plump them up once
anyway to favorite mascara to this the
Estee edit I've been using this for
about a month they're half now
absolutely in love with it with the two
different sides and then the lush
L'Oreal false lash sculpt mascara as
well and since getting my lashes back
again this has been I go to again so I'm
going to go for this one
this is the one that kind of gives me
get to me the most compliments when
people see it
loose mascara for someone like me who
hates my lashes this look she does look
like I'm wearing falsies that is mascara
done and you'll notice I don't have any
eyeliner on which is quite different for
me my usual style but it means summer um
I don't know I just really got away from
eyeliner recently if I'm going from off
a night out I will put on some cat eye
eyeliner but usually it's just the
glasses to me now I'm really enjoying it
okay the thing that's missing which is
play wise to look a bit weird is my
brows so I'm just going to use my usual
Armani brush and if I could recommend
one brush to you it would be this Armani
spoolie brush and I'm still on the
Armani wedge brows quickly whisk through
this because you've seen this one
thousand million times before
okay so that is brows doing pretty much
the whole face part from lip so I'm just
going to quickly set with the indicate
makeup setting spray long-lasting now
for lips I have been on the liquid
lipstick bandwagon now for probably two
months or so that's pretty much all I
been wearing like the matte nude lip and
over mixing got between a few different
ones usually anastasia beverly hills
crush it's like my favorite
your hollywood you have here as well and
also this is kind of new to my
collection back were wearing it for the
last week and this is Kat Von D bow and
arrow so I thought I'd kind of show you
what I've been doing kind of with
mixture B so I thought show you this one
so I would go around the very edges and
then I'll fill in like once
that's Kat Von D for narrow which is
super like stone nude so with this one I
found an Anastasia
liquid lip in pure Hollywood is gorgeous
so I just asked some to the center
Pat that in with your finger
and there we go that is my everyday
makeup routine finished it's quite a lot
less products than I would usually use
quite often I've tried to kind of scale
it all back use a very very best of what
I've got and that concealer palette is
kind of perfect for doing everything so
can producers down how many products I
need to use so this is what I've let you
been doing for the past few months so in
every picture I've been doing every
snapshot so many of you wanted to see
this sort of really hope you've enjoyed
it if you did please do give it a like
and if you're new then please subscribe

single week as always thank you so much
