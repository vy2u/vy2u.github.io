everyday makeup routine I haven't done
one in so long sometimes you see like
people on Instagram or on YouTube do you
think how did they get that makeup look
like everyday so many people ask me what
my lipstick is or what my contour is or
my eyeshadow is that I'm using so I
thought that I just do like a really
updated everyday makeup routine plus
because I haven't done a favorites video
in a while I thought it'd be kind of
cool to combine the two sort of go
through my everyday makeup routine while
showing you some recent favors so it's a
bit of a mishmash of the two together
but I hope you like it so without
further ado let's get into the look so
as I said with this I'm going to do kind
of favourites and everyday makeup
routine kind of splice together first
thing when I use is this is the new Vita
Liberata Beauty blur brand-new I have
the shade latter light this is a priming
illuminating radiance enhancing bronzing
and a Fonda layer for you makeup I went
to LA recently to do a photo shoot for
this with a vita Liberata which as you
probably know I'm a massive fan of their
tongues so it's just such a cool
opportunity I mean this is what they are
launching can i pile up at the back of
my hand who's gonna use a brush to it
iron I know if you can see how glowy
I'm radiant and like flawless that's
making my skin as well so there's also
Prime's the skin so it's like the
perfect base but underneath makeup
honestly I'm so blown away this is
literally at my new primer now my new
under makeup Savior this is a vita
Liberata body blur them like the super
famous product that i know so many of
you guys have probably know already
it's like body foundation I think and it
just like covers everything it just
enhances your complexion it gives the
most incredible glow like almost like a
little bit of a shimmery Sheen glow it's
insane and it's just been reformulated
this is a sunless glow version so with
this anywhere that you've put it it'll
start to self tell you it's a bit of a
win-win
again I want just to mention it and also
put it on with this lock just so it kind
of matches all of this I'm gonna take
down my scraps and tuck them into my bra
okay well and I feel fabulous now
obviously I will always have the time to
do it and like every day but I just
wanted to mention it as part of my
favorites and to kind of like complete
this entire look let's move on to the
base makeup what have I been loving
foundations I go through phases I love a
lot of different things the thing that
really blew me away recently is this YSL
Touche Claire all-in-one glow foundation
I have it in be 30 which is a little bit
dark for me but now that I've put this
on which is also slightly part of my
plan they should fit really really well
now because as well as this base down I
won't need anyone near as much now my
complexion has been sorted a little bit
it's gonna add a little bit more
coverage with the wire so mainly to the
center of my face really but I just
found this is so glowy it's like a
medium to high coverage my I love dewy
and very glowy foundation so this for me
is my taking all the boxes concealers so
this is a product when I get most credit
- recently the Dior concealer this is
what I'm gonna use the most in number 20
do your skin forever undercover can't
feel that I've been using this pretty
much since I got it so I think over
really over a month now as we like the
consistency I like the coverage it
doesn't feel too heavy and it just
manages to cover everything pretty well
gonna work in with a damp sponge but as
always I do always like to help with my
NARS creamy concealer I mean to be
honest today I don't like I need too
much of it but I'm down a little bit and
I love using it with this Bobbi Brown
concealer blending brush as well it's
quite a nice flat brush gets straight in
there and then it just means I can kind
of paint on exactly where I'm imagining
I need a little bit more coverage it's
very inner darkest circle area again and
just done a couple of different no
blemishes that I've got and I'll either
Pat this in or use the blender again but
I just want a little bit higher coverage
with this I find if you use your fingers
it just helps keep that coverage comes
contouring nothing has changed guys so
I'm really sorry if you've been here a
few times before
but I'm still on the Tom Ford higher
shade and illuminate in intensity one
this is about my third wall now I know
it's a total mess I straight into the
palette on my Real Techniques beo -
amazing contour brush I just love Korean
products I just love to keep that dewy
very creamy very luminous lots of skin I
mean some people would call it shiny and
a bit greasy I however I don't have very
oily skin though so I found that well I
think I can just about get away with it
I just really like having that very dewy
look to the skin so cream products for
me I might absolutely go - lets work
into my contour as always and over my
forehead just literally just join up
those two and quite often I was going to
chin a little bit too but what I like to
do is add a little bit on the brush and
I like to grit and push the brush
together to make it flat and then I'm
afraid to go along the contours of my
nose a little bit see you to do this
most mornings just for a little bit for
contour this is still my absolute number
one I love it the beauty light one from
Charlotte Tilbury I think it's
incredible I usually add this over my
skin most mornings but I have also for
the past month since my moldy strip
fallen back in love with the benefit
what's up highlight so today I'm gonna
use that instead this is just so amazing
super easy just draw it on rub it in so
this is a one and onto this month seeing
as this is like February favourites
mixed in this is the one I've been using
the most I kind of intermittent like to
be honest most mornings I do both most
mornings I put on Charlotte till Britain
then this over the top but I thought for
the sake of this today I'll just mention
this one I'll be completely honest solar
is another highlight involved obviously
it's the RMS Luminizer because I use
this every single day and let's just add
a little bit and tap it into the skin
it's not necessary whatsoever I just
it's just become a routine though for me
now I just add it every single day
because I was adore that glow I feel
like it just helps push everything else
and
in everything this looks illuminated
bullsháá bless you butcher butcher again
ever since the benefit trip there's so
many different products that I have
really found and fall in love with
including dandelion I think I've I
bought my first underlying when I was
about 17 if not 16 so I've just been
back on this again it's just the
prettiest little blush oh it's so pretty
it's just not too much it's quite subtle
but it's that little pink sheen and when
it mixes in with the highlight as well
on the cheeks so cute okay Bronson Alice
is one that is a major major favorite
who let light from benefit I thought you
know I want to give this a go and I just
find it's the most incredible crease
shade and bronzer for me straight in
with my armani bronzer brush as always
and just over the top of those rom spits
it would it be for kit just helped us to
take a little bit of the shine off and
it sets them for the day and as a touch
more color and then just down the neck a
little bit too and it helps us to blend
up you to blur it into the body blur as
well the other thing that I love this
for like I said it's the crease shade
this is a new favorite eyeshadow brush
as well Charlotte Tilbury eye blender to
use this straight onto the eye as
appreciate and it's a little it's a
winged out just so like to elongate the
shape of the eyes really can't do this
video without getting a mention as well
to my narcissist wanted palette my nails
want to palette I think this is
incredible I have been using this
non-stop I'm probably gonna go for a
little mix of these three one two three
that should just take them on my middle
finger just and then just Pat just Pat
them on the lid like literally that easy
it feels a little bit creamier so you
don't get too much for that but look how
oh I think it's so pretty
Plus as well it has a gorgeous gorgeous
crease shade here which I love and I use
this to deepen it up so for me if I
don't have my hoola bronzer with me to
do my eye look I can still get this
style
I'm also gonna powder since the lemare
translucent in 0-2 sheer pressed powder
as you guys know I don't I don't often
use many powders because I like to keep
this look and I'm not that early but
there are places where now I am rubadoux
per shiny
it just needs toning down a little bit
so I always use my Real Techniques I'll
link it down below whatever this is we
just lit a little bit and I just go just
here between my eyes and I've wiped it
over the middle of the forehead here
underneath the lips again that's where I
get bit shinier and also eye makeup
comes off here quick it's underneath my
nose over the tip of my nose and then
just up under my eyes I think this is
amazing it's just so fine it doesn't
look cakey you cannot see it on my skin
even slightly right now it just looks
like it's taken away everything I think
it's amazing earlier I put on a little
bit of the lip balm as well from the
mare which is the it's the one with the
pink shade which I have been loving cuz
it does add a tiny tiny Sheena pink
barely any thought the consistency that
subtle peppermint smell I can't get
enough of it got a little bit more that
so just finish off the eyes it's not
necessarily a favorite but it's a
favorite all the time because I use it
every single day for the past few years
or a year at least and it's just this
literally this little creamy shade here
I use it as my inner corner every single
day and have done for the past over a
year let's do mascara guys and if you're
watching the vlog she'll know what's
coming and if it bad girl bang yes I was
in the Maldives for that trip ever since
I used it I have not stopped no joke I
have not used any of the mascara since I
tried this about three weeks ago the one
thing I will say though is I find does
transfer if you have oil here or here
course it depends on the length of your
lashes but I've been finding that mine
have been touching here so what I've
been there for been doing is adding a
little bit more powder just up here
and I've found that that is really been
helping it's really interesting - the
other day I saw nakisha toriel's talking
about this as a favorite lower lash
mascara I kind of disagree
unless she doesn't have any oil under
here or maybe she packs so much powder
on that maybe it doesn't transfer and I
don't add that much powder here so maybe
that's my issue but because of that I
don't add this is a lower lash mascara
for that reason I'm gonna bring you back
in hello these always go better than
that side I don't know why seriously
big big favorite this month I think it's
amazing honestly I think it's fantastic
now for lower lashes I've been loving
the Mac extended play lash just because
the brush is so teeny-weeny and it gets
right into those lower lashes still on
the foolproof brow powder from benefit
in number 3
so I just fill in the lash a little bit
and then I just go to the top with my
Tom Ford fiber brow gel which I think
was in last month's favorites so I'm
reluctant to mention it again but it is
my everyday brows are done all finished
I mean I used to love having much darker
brows but I'm quite enjoying the more
natural more natural shade these days
lip pencil I have not changed that's why
it's this big tiny but it's my favorite
it's just the best shade I just refuse
it by patting it into the lip balm when
it comes to lipsticks so my favorite is
usually Alexander 82 however I've just
found a high street lipstick but I'm
obsessed with and it's this one it's the
L'Oreal color riche shine in 642 our
color could not be more me it's creamy
it's not sticky right not sick you Tom
it's got that almost fit panoply fruity
smell to it or the shine and this like
it's also got a medium gloss shine to
the finish honestly when I found this
last week I am so pleased and I
mentioned on my stories and so many few
message means said that you can out
bought it and you loved it so I'm so
pleased so most of the time Alexander 82
or this one now those are my two go to
to finish off everything I've been using
the Mac prep and prime 6 plus is a
cognate one got a bit the coconut smell
to it
so they can't make me some favorites my
February favorites let's finish off with
few my favorite perfume of the month
Arizona from Prentice cooler this
launched recently in New York Fashion
Week and it's the most beautiful firm
this has cactus flower in it which is
super rare no one is ever use cactus
flower before in their sense quite
absolutely lovely
