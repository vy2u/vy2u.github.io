exciting video I've been wanting to film
this video for so long just to tell you
all about everything that's been going
on behind the scenes and what I've been
up to for the past few months today is
the launch of my brand new blog if you
read my blog in the fro com
you will probably know already at what
it looks like it was very purple it's
for a lilac and it was started very
pretty and it's much a brand new refresh
and a completely new design so I was
helped by the awesome guy that pip dig
I'll leave their links down below and
they've created the most incredible
block for me I could not be more happy I
love it so much I've got so many new
features on it there's an area for my
traveling or what I've been doing when I
way it's got an air about food I'm gonna
restaurant reviews that I do fashion
pieces and everything that wearing as
well as my beauty reviews and also just
my general musings and more personal
posts that I write and advise your posts
and also a lot of news and everything's
for it's sectioned off and just a lot
more interactive and just hopefully a
little bit more exciting to read so
please go along and have a look leave me
a comment on the newest blog post on
there just let me know what things are
really really really hope that you love
it so it secured inside of that I
thought I would film a top 10 blog tips
video so many of you in the past have
asked me to talk about my blogging tips
and what I would say makes a really good
blog so if you are a blogger or thinking
of starting a blog very soon hopefully
these will help you so let's do my top
10 tips tip number one make sure that
you name your blog originally there are
so many blogs out there it's a very
saturated market so you need to make
sure that you have a blog name that is
very recognizable and quite unique
obviously it's very hard to find a
unique name these days because there are
so many blogs but if you can think a
little bit outside the box I think of
something a little bit different and
it's come up with something that people
really recognize so they'll be able to
go back and find your URL super easily
and on that same note when you're
looking for a name I would also check on
Twitter on Pinterest on Facebook and on
Instagram if someone has taken that name
already because the dream is to have the
exact same URL as your Instagram handle
your Twitter handle your youtube name
similar to how I have in the fro on
every single social media channel so
we're looking for me you can find me
that's the best way to do it so have a
look first of all does someone have my
name if so maybe tweak it a little bit
if you can if not then you might have to
settle for a social media handle it's
slightly different tip number two that
would be to choose which blogging
platform you want to go on for what you
need so there are three namely that I
would recommend this blogger which is
what my first blog was on it's a very
easy platform to use and you go to
blogger.com and you can get onto there
it's a Google service they put together
for bloggers and you can create
beautiful blogs on there so many
different types of blogs and templates
and you can also buy a lot of different
templates to go on there as well but
it's a very easy way to input blog
content and to upload it so if you
looking for quite simpler creating a
blog and that's your man if you want to
create blogs it's a little bit more
visual perhaps I would maybe say tumblr
might be for you because of course you
can kind of put a lot of pictures on
there and you can put a lot of content
on there and writing content and it will
often be the sort of feed format at one
by one by one but I would personally
recommend blogger and WordPress over
tumblr in all honesty unless you want to
create something a little bit more
visual and lastly is WordPress which is
what my new blog has been moved over to
so I started on blogger and now I can
move over to WordPress just because it
gives me a lot well it gives my
developers a lot more possibilities in
terms of what it can do with my blog
whereas with blogger you're almost
confined to how interactive you can make
your blog if you really want to go for
something incredible with lots of
different interactive features and make
it do something a little bit more alike
to our website can do
now say go for WordPress but in the past
I found WordPress a lot more difficult
to use at first but then people learn it
and it's super easy after a while so I -
I'm learning at the basics of WordPress
right now
tip number three once you find your name
and once you've found what blogging
platform you want to use I would just
say make it look gorgeous make it look
exactly how you would want it to look if
you're going to someone else's blog
there's a reason why you like particular
blogs quite often it might be because
they're designed beautifully or it might
be because as a content but I know for
me especially I love reading blogs that
look really beautiful often they can be
minimal or quite colorful but there's
something about them that is different
and its unique and its rate manageable
and it's just beautiful and easy to read
so you want to make sure that it's a
normal so you want to make sure that
someone will come back to your content
again again and I want to read it and
we'll really look how it looks
tip number four I would say post
regularly there are a lot of bloggers
out there who only post once every two
weeks and once every three weeks or even
more sporadically in the mass it could
be one week then it could be three weeks
and it could be two days after that and
I think that a lot of people like to
come back to blogs and expect regular
content they like see day by day for two
and a half years I posted every single
day
from the day that I started my blog
every day I would post something new
some new content but I found that I
preferred to post four times a week now
so I post on Mondays Wednesdays Fridays
and Sundays EPS in a week
because I found that some people don't
want to read things every single day and
I want to make sure that all of my open
posts have more breathing space and
people can read them and they won't get
buried too soon by doing too many so try
to draw a line between how many posts
and having too many and also not having
quite enough to try and keep it regular
and to some sort of a schedule tip
number five I want your readers to be
able to see beautiful pictures whether
you take them on an iPhone an iPhone 6
potentially we're taking on your iPad
your camera your SLR camera make sure
that they're quite high quality
in high-resolution images when I first
started I just use my iPhone five I
think it was back then and they were
great at the time but the quality
compared to what I do now was a lot lot
less and especially if you start to a
great job and upgrade it again like I
have a few times the quality of your
images in comparison can look they can
start to look quite noisy and quite
grainy and your old content that comes a
lot a bit outdated a lot faster because
your images almost look a bit
old-fashioned
almost because they're not quite as
beautiful as it could be so you can get
some amazing pictures an iPhone 6 or an
iPhone 5 just try and make sure that
whatever kind of images you use use them
throughout or else later content will
look completely different to newer
content so I would just say from the
word go try and get a really high
quality images on your blog
tip number six try to have really
exciting and original content so you've
got your blog it's looking beautiful and
now you need to put some content under
there and unregular like I said so just
try to make sure it's it's original it's
something that you would personally want
to read make sure that it gives your
readers some form of information that
they can take away whether it be about a
new style of clothes and that's come out
a new particular product whether it's
how you can wear this product with
another product to make it work and get
the lock you know just try and kind of
be free at your content a little bit so
that people can take something from it
so that not just reading it and thinking
I'm not a learn to anything here I'll
take anything away from this give them
something that they can really learn
from it and within that you also need to
understand your audience who is your
audience what age they what they like to
do what they want to read so you're also
going to define are you a fashion
blogger and you a beauty blogger and
your lifestyle blogger or do you do
everything so for me I am everything I
like to blog about what I'm wearing what
I love to put on my face so what beauty
products I'm using I love to blog about
lifestyle travel any food that I'm
eating so for me I would sort of call
myself a life
everything that I personally loved and
kind of given back to a lot of girls
that like me tip number seven would be
when you've got your original and
exciting content make sure that someone
proofread it for you or that you
proofread it I would recommend not just
writing your post really quickly and
then pressing publish I'd recommend
reading it a couple of times to make
sure that your spelling is right your
grandma's right they got some good
commas in there where they need to be
you've got all of your punctuation
everything's just correct in there if
you can make all your written content
really professional and much more
editorial in a way it's going to reflect
so much better on you it shows that
you've also got it shows that you
obviously have your own writing style
that you know how to use English
language roughly you know it just shows
you a little bit more of a legitimate
writer I know in the past I've read
blogs that have had
spelling mistakes and everything all
over the place and it doesn't look that
professional so if you make sure that
everything that you write is written
perfectly people are going to want to
come back to see what you say about the
next product or the next thing that
you're wearing tip number eight would be
I would recommend buying a domain name
so when you've got your blog name and
you set up on your blog if you designed
it on blogger then your URL will say
something like Victoria's blog at
blogspot.com for SEO search engine
optimization purposes it will be better
for you to buy a dot-com domain name so
as I have in the fro comm and it used to
be in the froude at blogspot.com
easy for people to find you just from a
Google search odd for typing it into the
URL bar so I would recommend buying your
name there really the cheap it can cost
like five pound six pound a year it's
barely anything and it can really gonna
help your blog tip number nine this
would be to get really social and by
that I mean when you I kind of mentioned
it before but when you set up your blog
I would also set up the Pinterest page
the Twitter the Instagram Facebook page
for your blog so that you're able to
then start sharing your content
because you could write a blog until the
cows come home but if you're not sharing
that content the chance of people seeing
it are quite minimal so you need to make
sure you're tweeting out your links to
new blog posts you're pinning the
pictures from your beautiful new blog
posts so people can see them on
Pinterest Pinterest is a massive
platform do not forget it
Facebook obviously there's different
types of audiences on these different
social platforms so it means that more
people can see what you are writing
about so just get social and start
really sharing our content and taking
more pride and I guess and just share it
around and showing people what you've
written and tip number 10 along those
lines are being sociable also stop
chatting to your fellow bloggers on
twitter twitter is great because it has
a lot of twitter chats so i'm pretty
sure they're still on Wednesdays and
Sundays from 8:00 till 9:00 and the
quite often with the hashtag be bloggers
or bloggers meaning beauty bloggers and
fashion bloggers or Elle blog this is
lifestyle bloggers and it's just a way
for different bloggers to bill to chat
and talk to the rest of the community
using that hashtag so if you want to
chat with other bloggers and get to know
new people go online I'm pretty sure
it's roses and Sundays but I'm sure I
Google search I'll bring it up and it
can just chat with everyone on there
who's talking about this was products or
talking about how they feel about
blogging at there's different topics
each week and it's a good way for you to
bill to share your links as well so at
the end of the chat people say what's
your link I'd like to read it this is my
link you can almost share links and it's
a great way to meet people and there's
my top ten tips I really really hope you
enjoyed them I literally sat here before
