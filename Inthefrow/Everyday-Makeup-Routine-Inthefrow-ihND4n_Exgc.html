this is going to my everyday makeup
routine a few things have changed a few
new products that I've mixed into the
mix and the makeup menu I guess and and
I started show you what I've been using
what I've been loving and what I've been
actually reaching for every single day
because I trust it enough to have it on
my face every single day just a few
things to point out but a little bit
different first off I've had my hairy
done extremely great at the roots going
down to a cool like platinum gray at the
bottom which of course will fade and
fade in/fade this will get lighter gray
more silver this will get more white a
more white and I'm just loving it as
always I always leave my salons name and
link down below
see George Northwood salon in London and
I get my hair done by Amy fish he's a
total legend and hair genius I also just
had my eyebrows we don't obviously I've
got some product over them now but I
love getting my eyelashes tinted and my
eyebrows done at the LMS Spa in London
love it there the ladies are amazing and
it's just such a beautiful spa and also
have new nails that I've got done at dry
buy that is it so this is going to be my
everyday makeup routine if you want to
carry on watching please do so and I
hope you enjoy but in makeup routine
okay I've not stopped using it yet it's
still my favorite 32 pounds to buy it
which seems like a lot for a little tub
of moisturizer but I honestly think this
is like an illuminator and a moisturizer
in one and the things it gives my skin
it just it's so hydrating I really trust
love and it comes to making really
hydrating and excellent products
recently I have been loving two new
foundations new foundations can you
believe I'm actually trying something
new for once it's the Make Up For Ever
HD I have been meaning to buy this and
get using it for so long and then I've
also got a Charlotte Tilbury magic
foundation in number three fair this
isn't fair
this is quite dark but in a moment I'm
quite tanned and I'm enjoying the tea
now this would be my normal kind of skin
tone this is the two darks I've been
mixing the
you I'm going to pump some of this on
there as well and my foundation brush of
choice for most days is the zoeva
defined buffer mixes Turner back my
hands with the brush and then start
painting my face peel out my lips as
always with some people comment and say
oh why should put foundation on lips for
me I've always disliked the color of my
lips and I really like nude lips so
that's just me other people don't bother
putting this in my lips because they
like the color of their lips and that's
good for them but I don't so that's why
I always do it I'm pretty happy with it
now but what I also do is go for
everything with a sponge underneath here
and it's a really lovely color as well I
think this is number one light and then
I'll go in with the matte breath and
brine and I'll put a little bit more in
the inner corners or sobriety up those
and in a little bit under here
yep done and then I'll just start dab
all of that into the face I'll also take
this bud and roll over the face as well
just to remove any other lines that we
may have missed from foundation brush
next thing I do is quickly set that
under eyes and as always I am still
using this I don't mean to be repetitive
new same things but I'm finding I'm
still really really loving these two in
the middle but I have started using the
Real Techniques cheek brush it's just
such a big fluffy brush and I find kind
of gets into the pan quite easily and
disperses the product really softly it
doesn't get stuck to the product on the
face so you can just disperse that
easily over that section
again as always is taking the central
color it's quite a stone Brown rub that
into my contours I just start underneath
the cheekbone and I'll create my line
being softer towards a cheek it's
completely up to you when you want to go
to I almost go to where my cheek starts
to form here in this little round circle
so I'll stop do it look under there but
mainly in this area here and then up
from there I'll make sure nobody go
below it but I'll start to brush circles
upwards towards my temples and then I'll
go in properly under the temples just
darken up the shade here the very kind
of corners of my face the thing I'm most
excited about though recently is what
I'm using to bronze with and blush with
and awesome slightly highlight and it's
the bare minerals palette 3 shades
inside bronzer a medium pink and a
lighter pink this lighter pink easily
could be used to highlight which I do
today but I'm really dry mixing these
two together for a really light cheap
shade with my Real Techniques blush
brush and I'm going to push that into
the bronzer will contour we created to
deepen it up over the top of my forehead
down my nose
my cheeks a little bit and I'll sort us
onto the neck couldn't take the lighter
pink I'm going to use that with the
anastasiya a 2/3 brush we use that with
the lightest pink on to top the cheeks
it's a very light natural pink shade
which is very very pretty and then just
finish off the blush I'm just going to
go in with both of the two Pink's mix
them together I don't want something too
dark I thinks it's such a lovely girly
flush though okay on my lips I'm going
to go in with the by Terry bobbed rose
but this isn't the one I usually use
this is so I usually use rosy babe now
this I think is the original it's just
the banda rose so doesn't have any of
the pink in it but it's still I love it
when it goes on to over top of nude lips
it just looks really quite frightening
all sorts like you're wearing like a
very light pink nude sheen next thing I
want to go in with is the eyes and I
have gone back to an old favorite I'll
be honest and it's the lorac one eye
honestly if I choose any palettes I'd
choose the right one and two I don't
know if that's true between them I don't
know maybe the second one that I do love
this one this is still a rack one it's
just the most stunning palette you can
if you're in the UK and you're thinking
now yeah but we can't get this in the UK
you can you can buy it on Nordstrom
it'll cost you like fifteen pound and
shipping but it's totally worth it it's
totally worth headaches for 15-pound and
shipping which means you'll get an
American product otherwise you need to
go to alter if you're in America I've
been using just three brushes to do my
eye makeup and this is the zoeva luxe
pencil brush so a little tiny pencil
brush I'm going to go in with the nude
shade and this one here which is Oh nuts
nude the cream shade and the nude shades
is clearly my most favorite colors
I shadow colors ever so moving to take
that nude on to the very inner corner of
the eye that just brightens up the lid
straight away then I'm going to take my
max u17 which is so de now in if I wash
it though it saves this color
unfortunately I'm going to go in with a
mixture of move move this light purple
Brown and the brown mainly more of the
mode though because I love at the moment
the kind of movie purple crease shade
that's what I'm all about right now so
just easily moving that back and forth
over the crease of the eye not too
bothered if it goes onto the eyelid
because I will be covering that up a
little bit in a minute but and as always
I'm just winging that out so using the
brush to create that wing and I'll go a
little bit into the under eyes too this
is the zoeva looks classic shader really
flat brush I'm going to take champagne
such an easy I look three shades now
three or four mainly three shades and
I'm just going to put that onto the
mobile lid
and then when that's done let's go back
to 2 1 7 and just neaten up the crease
again blending out that and I tell lie I
lied to you need one more brush just the
big fluffy brushes in my Sigma e-40 and
I just use this to blend out the top of
that eye shadow next up is brows and I
would love to tell you that I'm using a
different type of product at the moment
but I'm not I'm still on the same
products because I'm absolutely loving
them I take the show show armani spoolie
and i brush through my brows brush them
all upwards first favorite eyebrow my
stroke from giorgio armani in the to
wedge this is my tried and tested it's
the thing i prefer it works for me so
for every day i'm not going to be doing
something really random so apologies if
you cyka see in this
still on the whole thick brow train as
you might be able to see and then I like
to finish off with a gimme brow this is
in the dark version I think the
medium/deep version for liner I've got
two favorites and they're practically
the same product really the Tom Ford
eyeliner or the Estee Lauder eyeliner
difference with this one is that it's
got this really funny thick almost like
a rectangular kind of nib if you prefer
the really thick graphic eyes it also
has really great pen on it whereas a Tom
Ford one has to thin out so that's a
tiny little thin nib I barely ever use
that I always use the longer thin nib
and of this I've been mixing it up
between doing my entire literally lining
of the entire lash and winging or just
doing a tan wing and I think times going
to go for tiny wings so I usually sort
of try to make it look as if the line is
getting thinner and thinner thinner up
until about the middle of my eye and
then it gets thicker on the outside so
Joanne just draw a wing not always
one-handed and we'll say
draw up
and they really push it into the lash
line so it looks as if it's fading into
the lash line so as always I'm not going
to show you different the scour because
there isn't one that can beat this yet
for me so if you're new to this channel
you'll soon realize that the Clarins
waterproof mascara is the best mascara
for stray lashes okay so with both eyes
done it's just lips and I'm still
playing around the same colors I'll be
honest with you I do like to go for the
plums and sometimes the Reds ready plums
Browns and deep nudes around this time
of year but I'm still loving just to
play nude lip and I'm back on this line
and then mirror nest liner either end
once like the darker one side a lighter
I might go for the lighter one today
I've been toying with a couple so as
always my wife's on one which is my
favorite new pink but also to make even
more nude the Julie Hewitt lipstick
this isn't Edie I really love this shade
so I think I'm going to go in with this
something super easy this is almost like
a pink nude very light pink there fish
are laughs just using the urban decay
makeup setting spray
look my everyday makeup routine very
simple I know and it just uses a lot of
products that I'm absolutely in love
with at the moment just for a very
flawless perfected base really cute
little baby pink cheeks similar kind of
lip as I always do and the move eyes but
with very kind of simple eyeliner so it
was very kind of a very chilled look but
very brought together and pulled
together and quite perfected this is
just what I've literally been doing
every single day because feel like it
really suits me so I really really hope
you liked it hopefully saw a few
products in there that you potentially
loved and you really like the finish off
that's why I'm here just to show you new
products see how you can use them and
give you a few tips hopefully so let me
know what you thought down below in the
comments leave me 'like if you really
liked it and make sure that you
