tutorial this is this gonna be my
everyday popping out to the shops doing
kind of casual errands style makeup some
days I really like to spend hours or
kind of half an hour to an hour do my
makeup other days it's going to do like
10-15 minutes and that's what this is so
it's just quite quick quite simple to
kind of throw everything on there's no
real kind of precision to it at all so
if you're the kind of person you like
sort of quickly slap on some makeup but
still look really really good this might
be for you or otherwise you might decide
some of the products that I used and
what not so hopefully you enjoy this
video either way and let's just get to
it
okay so for those days I'll go in first
of all with the Vichy serum really like
really refreshing and just make my skin
feel hydrated I'm gonna follow that up
with the Vichy same one aqualia them out
sir madam this way I said formal that
was more exciting said that way okay
next up I haven't used this in a while
but you pull a will remember it the Mac
prep and prime and like this it's a
favorite of most people and I just apply
it in this kind of triangular shape a
little bit on my chin and down the nose
and then the Tarte yeah maracuja
creaseless concealer this is in light to
medium fund which matches my Tarte
Amazonian clay foundation which I'm yet
to use so this is quite thick so I find
that you need to sort of apply it onto
your fingertips first this then I'll
sort of rub them together and kind of
heat it up a little bit and then
in the direct run dry area my usual way
a Beautyblender from Real Techniques and
my vitamin E face miss a lot a shot it's
just a dump that you can use water just
as easily I'm just lazy cut I bother
getting up
so I'm just using this to Pat button to
the skin okay I'm just going to go back
night trusty Real Techniques buffing
brush I went office for a while side
using different bushes but it's always
remained one of my favorites it's going
in with a tarte amazonian 12-hour clay
in light medium sand I'm just on to the
brush and adapt that onto each cheek
onto the forehead and also Domino's so
the whole point of this is to kind of
miss this area that you just don't see
you're not applying to products and
evening quite thin
when I've got a bit of time Tarte
Amazonian clay is my go-to generally I
really like it ok so when that's done
I'm just going to quickly set it with
the Anastasia contour kit it's going to
use this you know just to do my under
eyes it's really not that yellow either
like it looks like it is super yellow
but it's not at all on the skin it took
the phone really I found I'm just going
to use my Mac College contour brush I
might need to get any one of these ok
looking fit birth where Tony's a central
color this is quite a nice contour shade
it's going to use about a shot pony
bronzer
it's gonna help those in to blend
together as well on my cheeks I often
use a variety of different blushes to be
enough her feeling more pink I'm feeling
more of a bronze or a peach I think
today I'm going to go with C Mac lured
to love blush really pretty peach
going the Chiquito trio enhancing blush
I used to highlight its so and on two
eyes and when I go in the tartlet
palette from Tarte just 12 really pretty
shades neutrals and darks and you can
kind of also see like colors like tones
working across here as well so here here
and here you're going to go quite basic
a thing gonna use free spirit and super
super mom on the lid I'm going to go in
with force of nature in the crease and
then natural beauty just kind of see our
corner we were super mama free spirit
and I will lead
now they can see I'm not being overly
precise of this because again this is
just kind of my is my everyday kind of
makeup machine we're just gonna throw it
on I'm not too precious about making
sure it's this section for most days
adds like a light base and they're going
to use a force of nature color which is
like a peachy Brown just perfect for a
crease shade
and we've got a little bit underneath my
lower lashline to could find it with
quite well on the other side
laughing do is going with a see the
Sigma e-40 take a little bit of maybe
supermom and just run that over the brow
bow and whilst also bring it down onto
that shade and blending them together
just blends out a bit more
I was gonna add a little bit of the
natural beauty as I said this into the
very kind of the corner and the crease
through orbit of color
and then we can just do it again take
some that super on the lighter shade
sort of work that into the intersection
start blending all that now
we men from really nice transition than
$3 shades outwards I'm just gonna use my
favorite at the moment which is the L
mascar precision brow gel and I've got
this in the shade or a w/e using my
Bobbi Brown eye definer brush as always
and always I'm just gonna very lightly
fill some sections in
I'm not done just use the benefit gimme
brow just go over that
it's going to that on the other eye
that's the ico liquid eyeliner and black
need to put that as a bed
that will do usually I'd have a much
spin at the end through a bit more
pointy but for day out I honestly would
just leave them because they're fine
okay just before put mascara on just to
get my hot ball just get my lips all
sorted I'm going to use the by Terry
Baume De Rose mom's run out of this and
it was an absolute will purchase again
absolutely and then this is always you
know Shu Uemura eyelash curlers and my
Clarins true waterproof
Bosh's turn and because i went in with
my eyelash curlers the top LEDs have
lost a bit their eyeliners and it's
gonna go over that and then finally so
what I'm really loving doing and in fact
I put a picture on Instagram I'll put it
here I put this picture on Instagram
when I was in Japan and I mentioned it's
my new favorite lip look and everyone
starts oh no what is it what is it but
I'll do it here for you so you can see
what I'm doing
so anyway sorry yeah this is max saw lip
liner it's gonna line and fill in my
entire lips with this shade
I'm also just overdrawn my lips to look
a little at bigger I'm just gonna you
see honey laughs lipstick from Mac and
run that kind of through the middle
it's almost as colony ellipsis he will
do with an on the lipstick but because
saris on there without Hamas equals to a
lip line it's slightly darker that's the
whole kind of everyday quick finish
makeup look so I'm sure you'll gray
super easy to do but it's quite cute
kind of nude it's all about the cat eye
flick as I always do and just a nice
nude lip it's kind of something you can
wear every single day so hopefully you
enjoyed it hope you did if you did then

kind of tutorials you like to see next
