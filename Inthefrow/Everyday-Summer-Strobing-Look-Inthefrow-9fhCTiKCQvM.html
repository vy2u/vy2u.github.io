video is going to be a makeup tutorial
my summary every day still my look I
know I do a lot of these kind of things
but this is a look I have been wearing
recently for all of summer really our
variations of this however I really
wanted to show you what I've been doing
with the naked smoky palette because
it's currently my new favorite eyeshadow
palette I've got blog post good about
this really soon I'm in love with it so
I wanted to show you how been using it
and also a bit more of my new favorite
lip and also a bit of a kind of stroke
and trend showing you how I have been
highlighting and contouring recently so
it's kind of like an updated everyday
makeup routine video for the summer hope
you like it if you do watching okay so
for my base I really only use this brand
new brush than Louise young brush I'm
just gonna use an oldie and a goodie
but now sheer glow I have the shade doe
fill and I'm gonna put it on the back of
my hands kind of work face mainly with
dabbing motions I like this brush and I
like the shape of it and the like the
brush head and all that but I think the
foundation it's not my favorite I think
it'd be better to use a kind of
powdering brush perhaps do you know what
I'm gonna change brushes I'm gonna go
back to my trusty Zoe the silk finish
okay I like that a lot okay I'm just
gonna go with Mac prep and prime under
the eyes the nose and on the chin is Kim
naquan skin enhancer in FX 0 5 slightest
I'll take a little dab on my finger
we're not the most hygienic way of using
it but
never caused me any issues I'm just
gonna take this peachy blender
perfect okay so I'm gonna take the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour palette
and instead of mine uses elysium brush
now as the way I will pro this I use now
which is a kind of a a kind of setting
brush so just very much under the eyes
just to set that powder under the nose
I'm gonna try this Louise young brush
this is the ly5 one usually I would use
the Mac large contour brush I'm gonna
give this a go I'm gonna go in with this
middle shade on the contour palette this
might be a really lovely
oh I like this brush
is it easy-peasy
I love that brush that brush is a Gooden
and then I'm just gonna use my Estee
Lauder I promise god Esperanza just to
make sure I mean how beautifully brushes
still techniques brushes okay so
highlight I have been loving it after
this whole like strobing thing happen
but ever almost talk about strobing aka
highlighting without contouring I was
like I like that however I don't want to
go without my contour so this is kind of
a strobing highlighting the way I do it
take the Sigma e-40 brush and the Kevin
Kwan and comes a light highlighter I
really love putting this on the very
tops of the cheekbones you loose the
brow bone
Becca champagne pop
can you just see how highlighted that is
it's what you like my face almost looks
wet from the Sun it is that right right
I'm gonna add the same thing to thank
you
that is amazing okay finishing touches
to the base hourglass ambient lighting
powder as always and using this one I'm
just gonna use this on the blush brush
because I just like to use it to brush
through I'm just gonna take the cheek
brush from Real Techniques and when I
swipe it through this shade right here I
have a kind of highlight and shade and
sort of sweep it under this section here
highlight that's what the summer glow is
all about now and then just on the
forehead - pretty much my whole face is
just gleaming cheek blush I use all the
time first love it's my favorite using
it on the zoeva brush brush
still warm up those apples
exciting bit I'm gonna go in with a
naked make a smoky palette I've just
been writing a blog post about this
actually so you've got to see that in a
few days time I start with here thirteen
this this wine Tish champagne II shade
on the very end I'm gonna put that into
the inner corner also gonna run that
into the inner third I'm just using real
techniques then I'm going to take
compost right here which is an
incredible incredible crease shade
especially for my kind of skin tone so
we're gonna work that into the crease
the exciting bit comes now I am obsessed
with this shades called date sweet so
I'm just going to take that on to the
middle of the lid it's so beautiful
so we're pretty I'm just going to take
hi on the very end it's more sharp a
nice shade and that's what I'm going to
put over this inner corner section here
just do a little sparkle and lighten up
a little bit and then I'm gonna use
radar which is this third one here more
of a shimmery Brown
when I go in with the anastasiya barrel
hills dipbrow pomade
in soft brown and tonight Bobby Brown
eye liner brush at the moment my
eyebrows are dyed which I absolutely
love so a bit darker and don't really
need much filling in
since the bodyshop eyebrow gel you
really need a new one
this is so full of brown pomade no is
the effort decay for ice I'm gonna try
and do it in front my camera so you can
actually see me but my everyday look I
used to go halfway on the eye and
there's begin to wind it out
it's a very generic easy line I don't
seem to care with my shoes Amira
Achilles and this is the quarians
waterproof mascara the bottom lashes as
well that mascara literally works
wonders so good okay so let's look I
have been loving has been a mixture of
my usual by Terry Baume De Rose lip balm
my Mirren s lip pencil in creaky cocoa
and the nude six love pencil when you're
lining your lips I always do it from the
the crease of the lip and work over in
an arch then when they're lined I'm use
the by Terry
it's in the center okay and then it's
gonna fill in this color just rocks my
world quite frankly I love it so much I
think I saw it I was like yeah that's me
in a lipstick and that's all I've done I
love it so hopefully you liked it too
