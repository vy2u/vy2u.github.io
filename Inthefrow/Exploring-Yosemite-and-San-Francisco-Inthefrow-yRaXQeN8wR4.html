Brian okay from barely keep my eyes out
there right now yeah we're on our way to
Rachel and not too sure where that is
apparently it's quite near to area 51 so
hopefully we'll see some aliens flying
around and yeah we've just come from
where we come from
Diane oh sionis it was amazing fun I won
the company why the Lord was just the
best night ever
I set massive hike that we've done all
the way to the very very top for the
angel funding so that was incredible so
now we start off at 7:00 a.m. this
morning we're making our way to make
sure we're gonna have hot springs this
is awesome self-serve nutshell dip so of
course I went for this yeah so it's one
dollar so at 9:00 pinup shows and then
all you can eat cheese apparently so I
went a bit crazy we just realized that
we're back in the varner again so we
want to making our way across back
across the country
so this is whereabouts we are panaka
apparently it's called
but it's kind of just an expanse of
desert road I've been driving for age
where we are do terrestrial highway 50
miles to Rachel that's only like an hour
uh-huh
I think from the middle of nowhere a
place called Rachel
today we traveled for about eight hours
from Zion - rachel is a really turn
their place stupid like aliens do one
and then we carry on traveling and we've
gotten out of somewhere called Bishop
Bishop and staying at the hot springs
got two I think tubs and hot spring tubs
and no showers anything and Watley
toilets but they'll be fine and just
stand there so just complete five
minutes here is my town and we found
this cute little car checks barbecue
place so I decided myself my uncle Te'o
weird pulled pork cheese coleslaw that's
gonna be okay look at this this is what
I got
it's called the split but so it's a
jacket potato with pulled pork mac and
cheese I think coleslaw and then a
gherkin which won't get me
it's all for yeah it is
look at our hot tub hot spring since
we're filling up with water whilst we've
been away it's a high it feels hot I'm
kind of oh yeah and kind of feel a
hotness is it we're all gonna get in
here and we're gonna drink some
champagne and we're going to play our
favorite wolf game
should be amazing last time I was living
potentially biking
so I'm still making my mind
I'm gonna set up camp do a bit more
hiking tomorrow I think and then it's
off to San Fran I'm having a house party
O'Brien's so Ralph Eliza
maybe something just because my mind is
gone just sitting down to have some food
before we start walking
have you posted
this lace is just so beautiful it's a
spit to get how to sit in how pretty is
right
try find yourselves on this is this a
try you'll never find a way home you'll
never find a way
so I'm just sat next to the Lower Falls
at Yosemite National Park and decide
kind of wrap up this sequence of events
if you're coming to you submitting I
would definitely recommend coming here
this is called Lower Falls you can see
all of this waterfall coming all the way
down here and I would also recommend
doing the mist trail which I did last
year which is amazing and you come down
by the John in your trail to come back
down and you come down inside a
waterfall that's all amazing so if you
don't do that you can just go to the
vernal falls I think it's called you can
see Falls there but we did go to Mira
late as well and it was all dried up so
make sure that if you come in the summer
months the least asked if it's still
very long we might not be and so a bit
disappointing otherwise it's just an
absolutely beautiful place
right away
hey so it's day 17 I wasn't able to film
the end of yesterday when we went to
Yosemite and so all the Falls and things
because my memory cards are sore
so I had to film a few things on my
mobile so I hope that the quality was
okay and so now we're just going to take
a quick walk in the forest and see the
sequoia trees and you swim too
and then we're going to get on the road
get to some Fran by around 5:00 okay for
a house party
