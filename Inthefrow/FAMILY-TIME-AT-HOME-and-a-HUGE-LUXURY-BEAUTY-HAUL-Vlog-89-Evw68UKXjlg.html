again I'm just getting really nice and
cozy look who's on his guitar smelling
amazing by the way
oh is it Louis by ghulam oh I thought it
was Armani okay no probs
he's not great today I'm gonna get in a
face shot I'm literally so excited about
this as you guys probably know I have
been trying out a skincare brand called
a Lumiere MD now for the past maybe 1213
weeks I need to work it out because
recently my products of all around out
almost at the same time so it's giving
me a really good inclination of how long
each product lasts and I think it's
about 12 weeks which is like perfect for
skincare it's all I've been using
absolutely loving it so far I found that
my skin overall hasn't broken out since
apart from here which is hormonal I've
only broken out here everyone else has
been fine I feel like especially here
and across here has gotten a little bit
tighter and firmer I'm gonna speak with
Vicki today she is like the lead
consultant for a Lumiere MD I'm just
really excited it's in Harvey Nicks in
this beautiful little salon if you
remember 12 weeks ago when I last went
maybe 30 you know it might be even more
than that anyway today we are going
doing that Alex is gonna come with me
he's gonna go looking for some gorgeous
baby clothes for a little nephew Finn
Killeen in this weekend it was his
birthday last week so we're gonna get
some bits with it by fin gonna get some
bits off in it it's gonna get some
clothes for Finn and then back home so
I'll bring you along with me so you can
kind of see what I'm doing for my facial
cuz I know a lot of you guys can get
really interested by skincare and
different treatments so I'll bring you
along for that hence why I look like
this no makeup I'm just going like
makeup free all day carefree and
enjoying the most fashion model yet UPS
guys I'm sorry about the way I look
right now
I'm just about to have my clothes
and with a lumia MD we're gonna try it
on my forehead first and then I'm
different patches on my skin because
it's a really intensive people massively
about rejuvenates and renounces the skin
and then within like five six days my
skin is gonna look like brand new
okay I'm all done edge of my glow peel
luckily it wasn't because it can react
differently on different people and for
me it's like a little bit tingly
but now the rejuvenation like the
regeneration of my skin is that a bit
like insane and I've got my little kit
as well I can kind of follow it my
post-procedure prescription so I'm gonna
go meet Alex now I'm gonna go get a
coffee
me nights obscure little around
everything so adorable come to M s
because it is have like the best ranges
or what really gorgeous kids clothes I
like these little little tree nose yeah
my skin feels great now so the idea what
this is
it was a globe peels it's like a
chemical peel quite an intensive one so
over the next night five days top let's
go at your eye off and on flake off just
start the building of the fresh gorgeous
skin below I'm gonna do a course of
these I think why you have like one a
month maybe like four of them I know
over that time my skin after that was a
completely brand new so no blemishes no
like bad things on it like with a heart
it's a dot card that's really cute and
then let's go for some food okay we're
back and now I've got to head out again
I'm gonna go to boots today for our
travel vaccinations not overly pleased
about it once a bit a while about we
want to get trial vaccinations as you
may know and then you run out of
hepatitis A injections so hopefully
they'll some more for today we probably
need that for India so we're gonna go
find out anyway we finished our typhoid
treatment so we've got that I think we
does need to have a tie to say no for
India so we're gonna go get that the
next time you see me I'll probably have
a dead arm okay so it's it's about half
now and I think I have been writing my
new glamour column I don't know how it's
already been two weeks it's my last last
column I write the fortnightly articles
for glamour
so I've just been doing that with my
evening alex has been on this game all
night
does anyone else have a boyfriend or a
girlfriend
is obsessed with this get what's it
called play unknown battlegrounds its
habitat for night play unknown
battlegrounds what stop playing I know
one tonight as well have you told me
yeah so we had our vaccination sale yeah
well I like said one likes had his happy
time to say I had hepatitis A and I also
had to have like a booster for my like
DD team polio or something
it's like diphtheria yeah that's
something tetanus and polio so I've just
had that done and Alex I don't know why
I do
I like they'd run out of injection
salons couldn't have his kind of glad
those happy exact c'mon don't so I've
had too much have one my arm does
literally feels like completely dead oh
this this section here just feels like
but it's done now they're so you're
working oh yeah yeah front of you guys
that going to India for places that need
these kind of injections and yeah I had
to have that booster shot because I had
it in the UK usually have it when you
like 14 so and it runs out after 10
years apparently it's bad to have that
done and literally could barely ver feel
that like she didn't even feel it the
Hep A for me again it was barely any and
he's funny long as I felt it I mean I
did feel it but I really thought it was
a good it was a good nip yeah I mean
mine my neck but only for that literally
like a scratch
yeah so if any of you guys that don't
like injections I hate injections and I
was absolutely fine mine just it the
aching of the arm is worse than the
injection oh yeah yeah yeah Oh heavy
