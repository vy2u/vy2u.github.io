welcome if you are brand new here I am
Victoria this is my channel in the fro
nice to have you hey to everyone else it
is coming back it's so nice to be sat
back down filming a video I've not
filmed in over a month because I've been
away so I hope you've been enjoying all
of the traveling content and the vlogs
there's been a lot of logs and this but
a lot of content it's just not
necessarily been here in this chair so
it's nice to be back and think hey to
you guys and going through some November
issue favorites but not to a bit
November a lot of these things I'm gonna
showing you I had with me for my like
three four week trips so obviously
they're gonna be favorites because I use
them every single day and love them oh
how cute is jumper oh it's so cute
apparent this is Dominica dulces cat I
thought right today for this video
probably the first favorite would be my
trip to NASA my zero-gravity experience
it was absolutely insane and the other
day I went to a dinner and a few people
thought the zero-gravity experience that
I did was inside a wind tunnel on earth
and I was like no no like how would a
wind tunnel go sideways it's not gonna
make any sense so I was up in a plane
32,000 feet I need to watch that flock
if you've not watched that vlog honestly
it's the best vlog I've ever filmed I'm
so proud of that vlog it just sums up an
insane trip so if you know it already
that is literally on my favorite things
off the past few months so I'll leave it
linked on the screen so you can go and
watch it please do watch it and my
favorites
absolute favorites so yeah anyway but
let's get into beauty favorites okay
first up with hair this I had with me
I'll weigh around America I've got a
couple of bottles of this now the
L'Oreal Clarisse it's silver shampoo as
you guys know I like to keep my hair as
platinum and brass free as possible so I
always use silver shampoos every time I
wash my hair but I only really wash my
hair once or twice a week every 4 or 5
day so bear that in mind if you are
gonna be starting using this kind of
thing I would test it out on your own
hair first I'd build up how long he
leave it on for but I usually for about
3 to 5 minutes 5 minutes if I really
need to get rid of the brows out of my
hair just as soon as your hair is wet
smash this all over it cover up your
hair so it's all purple leave it for a
few minutes
rinsed out put some conditioner as you
normally would use this as a second
shampoo by the way I shampooed my hair
first then I use this as a second
shampoo then a condition the cool thing
about this I usually use the Loreal Pro
silver shampoo which I still highly
recommend I love but this is new from
l'oreal paris so it's like six pound
super affordable and does a very very
very similar job I'd say this was less
drying on the hair which is probably
because it's not quite as strong as
Loreal Pro this is so good honestly it's
brilliant so I'm so glad that L'Oreal
brought this out I am so pleased with
skincare fav regen oil now it seems very
similar to bio oil if you can't find
this this I think I've gotten an Aldi
ages ago like I don't know how all this
is but it's still absolutely fine but
I'm pretty sure bio oil would do the
same thing but I'll see if I can find a
link for this regen I'll adapt down
below it's full stretch marks scars dry
skin and blemished skin I've been
breaking out all of my my forehead and
those tiny under skin bumps I'm breaking
out on my chin which is wigs I haven't
for like six months and I've been
getting a few Lema she's here there and
everywhere so I started using this and
literally started like massaging in so
if 30 seconds to a minute each place it
is massively helping it's really kind of
rehydrate in that area allowing it to
start healing itself much quicker I
honestly I found this to be like my
Saviour recently I think it's incredible
so so glad to be back on it and it's so
affordable
should I still feel like my coal this
makes me sound a bit funny okay this
came into my life in the past few weeks
and I've absolutely fallen a
head-over-heels in love in it you guys
really know I big fan of the Armani
Rouge Amalekites eye my absolute
favorites so I haven't actually tried
any others of the Armani Prive scents
until this turned up for me and it's
absolutely insane
this is the SWOT nap Dina could probably
totally butchered that anyway I think it
means like the kind of glistening
pearlescent version which is for limit
Edition for Christmas now it's sold out
most places there's a couple left in
that Harvey Nicks and Selfridges maybe
but otherwise it's pretty much sold out
online as soon as it comes back online
I'm gonna be notified about it and I
will let you guys know but let's just
say this is the most beautiful bottle of
perfume
ever and the smell is just absolutely
insane know how to explain that it's
just absolute beautiful you will need to
try it and if you're someone looking to
buy a friend or a relative a very very
special perfume this year you will not
be able to go wrong with this I also
have the candle too which of course I'm
not going to be burning for a very very
long time but again if you're not really
wanting to go for this the actual scent
then the candle again will make a pretty
awesome present so I have this on my
desk right next to me every day and I
adore just like smelling that smell
highlight I mean get a lot of people ask
me what highlight I've been using it's
not this today it's the base of this
actually and then I've got something
over top chart celebrate beauty light
one I'm pretty sure I've almost ran out
of this because I've been using it every
single day really for the past six weeks
like this little top like this can you
see it looks like this and then you just
can rub it in with your fingers but it
but it with your fingers and it gives
this beautiful sheen glow almost like a
lit from within kind of vibe to the skin
it's beautiful it's fantastic it's a
base you're gonna put down first and
then put something over the top so it
really grips on there or if you want to
kind of put this on and Pat it in it's
just absolutely amazing I cannot
recommend this and no I think it's
insane okay random favourite but yeah
toothbrushes again this would make an
awesome Christmas present for anyone
that's really in taipa dental care I
wanted to like really get their teeth
looking beautiful next year just an
electric toothbrush in general I've
definitely my voice is definitely weird
I can hear myself speak here sound weird
I mean this is like the rolls-royce off
to youth brushes it does a lot of things
it connects to phone it tells you where
you've not brushed enough in your mouth
it's like the crown jewels of all
toothbrushes so can't really recommend
any marketing is just awesome it's
expensive it really is pricey but if you
want to invest in dental care like this
it'll kind of last you three just need
to keep changing the headphone it so
wanted to mention up because it came
with me everywhere and I think it's
fantastic
this lemare bronzer has not left my side
it's a bit dirty now it's really very
dirty and it's so pigmented I have not
tried a bronzer that's this kind of
pigmented for a very very long time
let's just a few sweeps and you can pack
it on it's stunning I like that you can
also kind of go a bit lighter
you want to we can go full on like
terracotta bronzes it's not oranjee it's
not to Dueling it's just a fantastic
bronzer I think it's amazing how much
like what is in my pile of things here
this mask again because I've been
breaking out a lot I have been doubling
with masks a bit and this one is the one
I always go back to L'Oreal pure clay
detox mask the last few challenge I've
used this the next day I've woken up my
skin just looks so much better
ulema shears are fats so much more
reduce it's not as much redness and it's
under this one that detox mask ourselves
so the purity mask which is green I
would highly recommend both such a good
affordable price for a mask you could
just you see how I just use my hands but
can also use a brush if you want to as
much dimension X I think for an
affordable mask that really works these
are fantastic
in fact as well the started selling like
a little 3-pack we can try them out like
testers leave a link down below we can
get that from courser super handy as
well oh and nothing to also mention the
other perfume absolutely in love with
this is actually my second bottle my
first one I've got a left in Chicago at
my best friend's house which is just
typical
this is absolutely beautiful it's the
first Tiffany scent in fact if I mention
this recently Domitian recent favorites
it's the first Tiffany scent for 50
years it's a big big deal and it's
absolutely gorgeous it's caught like a
very famous Tiffany diamond
it says Tiffany this is Tiffany and Co
just in here on this ring it's just one
of those things and the box it comes in
and I'll see you get a Tiffany bag and
it's so special I think if women open
this on Christmas Day and they're going
to go a little bit crazy
it smells stunning I don't know if
anyone could dislike this smell it's
absolutely wonderful so had to mention
up to right now I think that's all the
beauty of a couple of things from
fashion that I am digging the past few
months these shoes I have to mention
look at what I did to the guys yeah if
you've seen that if you see my picture
with me and the ground can't even with
these poops on a lot of people like sake
why are you wearing those but I mean I
was taking pictures you've gotta wear
boots
nice places take pictures I mean
absolutely fine oh I just think needs of
the most gorgeous boots they're so well
made they are the textures of them is
beautiful and even I did wear them to
Grand Canyon they're still looking
pretty damn awesome this jumper which is
out inside out now because I wore it
yesterday but it doesn't make any
difference it's the same I saw this
something I fell in love with it bought
it literally within about an hour cuz
like apps I absolutely have to have this
and I haven't taken it off to be honest
I literally wore it pretty much every
day in Chicago I don't think it's a
fantastic jumper it's beautiful quality
it's really nice warm and it is not too
overly expensive for a quiet cool knit
jackets I've had a few gorgeous jackets
recently but this is the one I've
probably worn the absolute most
reversible shearling jacket from me and
the quality is absolutely superb it's so
nice and warm and like I said you can
reverse it and have a ceiling on the
outside if you prefer so the thing about
this is that you literally get two
jackets and want you get one that looks
like sheepskin to the outside which is
sheepskin to the outside if you want to
you converse and get the shearling so I
just think it's that look absolutely
gorgeous jacket I love how you can just
throw it on it looks really cool and
like open now it's really love this
jacket I think it's fantastic jeans I've
worn these a few times again and vlogs
you'll have seen them I always kind of
say this just to kind of prove I have
been wearing them a lot and that's why I
love them so much you'll see them in the
vlogs
these black jeans again these are from
me and em but they're a really straight
leg black they're not skinny for once
and I just really like this shape on me
I feel like it looks really flattering
it's very cool it's not that skinny jean
style so it's it's got something else
and I like the way if you pair it with
heels it just gives you a bit of a
different silhouette than usual skinny
jean style there are really fantastic
fabric they feel amazing that the
thickness and the quality is just
wonderful I'm gonna very quickly mention
this top because you guys all seen this
so much I'm almost sick of it myself
this is a blouse from C by Chloe I know
someone if you love it too because I
have seen via my links how many of you
have actually bought this top since I've
mentioned it so I'm so glad you guys
like it - I think it's so pretty
navy blue polka dots it
quite shear that comes with it so grease
it comes for the in there Cammi but
honestly it's a beautiful top it's great
for work it's great for date night it's
great just a pair with jeans if you want
to look a little bit more done up and a
sink it's absolutely beautiful their
very last thing there are a few bags
that I did want to mention is favorites
especially like Chloe Chloe backpack
that I have the blue one and use that as
almost like my handbag for my my big
trip well this was the secondary thing
that I had the second handbag it's this
Jimmy Choo bag absolutely love with this
I have been wanting one of these Jimmy
Choo locket bags for so long I could
never decide on a color and then when I
saw this in the black with the studying
an embellishment I totally fell for it I
think it's just super cool and I've said
it before but he's such amazing quality
it feels fantastic it's not gonna lose
its shape actually fits quite a lot in
here it's just one big this is kind of
like my night out kind of back when I
was going I don't know about on my trip
I mean they didn't wanna go on too long
with us November favorites but it has
been a while since my last one I think
it was September my last one yeah guys

kind of vlogmas I know I said I was
going to do flog miss fro miss and I am
to a certain extent got a video in fro
