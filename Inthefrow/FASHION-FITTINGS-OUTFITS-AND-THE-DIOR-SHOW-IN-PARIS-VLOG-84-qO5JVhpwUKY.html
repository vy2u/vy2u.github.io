not to treat yourself to something

romantic getaway or something like that
honestly I can not recommend this place

I feel how to sleep look at their room
oh my gosh this is so sweet
Italia cologne has just delivered to my
room oh how lovely
Wow Mont Mar butchering the French
language every single day oh that's
pretty
almost smells a bit like freshly cut
grass and springtime
but comes in matches okay you're ready
to leave I don't wanna leave this
beautiful place I've had it the nicest
I'm staying here I didn't even really
get time to use this lounge area mind
does have my luggage picked up when I
head down now and get a taxi over to the
W so meeting lore'l now over the W I
think Alex and Fiona from L'Oreal should
already be there so yeah that's the next
thing in a day but it's beautiful today
although but it's breathing made it to
the W and look what I found in my room I
weigh the hotel brought Alex over for me
as a gift
surprise gift in my room not my joking
he's got here we're going to go just
Phillips a little bit of food at
galleries Lafayette I think so yeah I'm
really hungry too I've eaten a lot over
bread from this morning on my breakfast
tray yeah go get that food let's go my
main goal
I love it this is what I was pretty cool
so I got it from this really cool Club
actually which means from Queens forever
oh really
never he's about to start all the times
of like I can see those in my lipsticks
multiplied together and watching this
this is
the largest army in here
now concealer
- my first beat
perfection I've got to shut it neither
maybe I've opened it with the hand
sanitizer
hello parcel arrived from money affairs
I ordered directly to the hotel because
I was a little late ordering I needed
some shoes to wear to aquaszero
presentation so I'm just a little pair
very very me if are so nice look at
those they are so gorgeous I love the
peep toe I don't have many beats like
this with peep toes I have one pair and
I love them and I don't wear them a look
at that look like was there a pineapple
these are grapes I'm gonna wear these
now quickly change into these and then I
also ordered these here but I'm not
going to having these in this weather
I mean these aren't exactly appropriate
either pair of Valentino so me nights
are going on a little trip next month so
I've ordered some more beach sandals and
Valentino just come out in this with
this style with they are adorable I love
those and I mean yeah they're not going
to be good for here but I want it
towards them with these just so they
came together
can I show everyone now so Alex wasn't
here yesterday the reason Kyle was with
me after not Alex's cuz answers getting
this tattoo done it looks looks painful
um so it needs color in yeah it's not a
big red Sun you're gonna get a big no-no
probably get some like gold on the feet
and lots and lots of more shading up
there which will not be fine yeah
oh you're struggling aren't you no
sovereign gotta suffer for these
gorgeous tattoos I'm afraid right let me
try out my new
to the room and I need to get ready for
the Kenzo show this is what I'm wearing
it's very very cool bomber jacket Ken's
a bomber jacket and this wonderfully
patterned skirt luckily it pulls in at
the waist and makes up really kind of
like tapered and quite flattering but
then with the bomber over it'd look
really really cool and then I think I
might wear my new friend a boots that
arrived and that on my Dior boots either
one and then I've got my got Kenzo back
to wear as well but I really like this I
think it's really cool a little bit
different for me
okay I'll ready for the Kenzo show what
girlf we did a first I think and then
off to Kenzo we didn't know what to do
with my hair so I kind of got it in this
half-up half-down dude don't know if I
like it go like it yeah off the food
again
and it literally goes on all the way
so excited
well that was interesting
very unique show so those are some
absolutely gorgeous pieces and they're
like the knitwear and the cape on there
some really cool prints obviously a lot
of florals or patterns or prints very
Kenzo and then those massive bushes
really really interesting so anyway I
just got back alex is in bed not feeling
the best because of his tattoo I'm gonna
get in the shower get myself in bed and
do some work
