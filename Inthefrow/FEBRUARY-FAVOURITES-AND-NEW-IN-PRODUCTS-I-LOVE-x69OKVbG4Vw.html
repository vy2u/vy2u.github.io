all doing really well this is going to
be a new famous video for February human
Watson it was a very favorites and a new
end products I love where I like to go
through everything that I loved for the
month and also a few new products that
I've been sent or picked up myself so I
haven't quite used that much and yet I'm
still really excited about them so let's
get into this because quite a lot here
I'm going to start off allow you to do
from kind of like base forward we can
see my whole face routine in case you're
wondering what I'm wearing today you're
prolly gonna see it so starting off with
the Estee Lauder and Victoria Beckham
morning aura Fellows for a while didn't
use it quite as much and maybe I should
really really liked it but recently I
went to Victoria Beckham show in New
York which was absolutely dreamy anyway
when I was there they gave me an amazing
goodie bag of VV products and it
reminded me about this product start
using it again and realize just how
glowy and illuminating outfit is it
really is beautiful I think especially
for those that don't like to use very
glowy basis like serums or moisturizers
are quite glowy this is a great kind of
top coat on top amongst rejoice serum I
can't like do serum moisturizer and oil
and then this and then often now and
again a little bit more primer and then
foundation depends how many layers you
like so no not many people like that
many layers well it just feels
moisturizer this is a great glowy
illuminating face before your foundation
or you can add it in with foundation if
you want your foundation to be a bit
more glowy but it's just really lovely
very pale essence to very sort of light
cream colored suits mixed in and just
yeah makes a big difference I really
love it for packaging it's so beautiful
okay after that I've really discovered
at our favorite the Tarte Amazonian clay
two of our foundation I've mentioned
this a few years back I'm sure still a
big fan of this and I can't rediscovered
it in my collection recently when I
threw some things out and we found it so
the news earnest and it's perfect for
what I'm quite tamped but at the moment
I'm not all that and so I've been mixing
it with a luminous silk foundation from
Armani in shades three it was a little
bit lighter and the two together have
been and really lovely coverage nothing
too super heavy but also covering
everything that I want and then I always
go over with
cela anyway to really protect everything
but just as a lovely if own say it's
lightweight it's not lightweight it
doesn't feel like I'm wearing what for
my face oh it's definitely not a really
lightweight coverage it for a medium
coverage so I'm in like in those two
together with the foundation also a big
fan of this brush the weaver petite safe
definer so we were recently launched
quite a few new brushes I mean their
brushes are amazing anyway I generally
use only their weaver morphe real
techniques anyway or armani
but this brush is just a really great
safe brush just for foundation for even
for doing bits of concealer things like
that it's not too big it's also not too
small but you can have gone through a
journey use it gets into all the nice
little gaps and creatures around my
hairline that I wanted to honestly it's
it's a big big favor I think it's a
brilliant brush and then I can't hate
myself for mentioning these because
everyone else has but I feel like I need
to and it's a tarp shape tape concealer
well one of my very best friends in
Chicago she bought these for me because
I couldn't find them anywhere in the UK
she got them for me sent them over and I
was ridiculously excited about them I've
got fair neutral which I like to put in
a very very inner corners of my eyes
and then I go over the rest of my face
in light neutral it's a little bit more
warmer and yellow toned and I like to
put that everywhere else follows it with
these the hype it's most absolutely real
they really really enhance the whole
skin without feeling too cakey at all
like at this point my under eyes don't
look cakey that one's got too much on
and yet everything is concealed
better than anything else I probably
ever use so big fan as a shape tape I
hate to be that person but if I can find
links when you're in the UK I will do
down below so I should have contoured a
bit I still am using this Chanel related
terms to Chanel that's right I'm still
using that as my kind of contour and
just kind of defining but then I like to
go over with a bronzer and again this is
a rediscovery out of my bronzing brush
draw again when I was young sizing and
this is such a great bronzing powder
bronzing and blushing I say that because
I mean this is shade six organza at me L
and this because of the orangey tone I
am loving it on my skin at Loehmann's
Kobashi prom so after I contoured and
brush this over with a big brush I like
to use me real techniques so rubbed off
now I mean you got the blush brush
actually I love this brush so much and
I'll just especially use morphe orangish
aid make sure i get into there and push
it over my cheekbones and I'll use more
of the darker shades all the rest of me
and then I try and stay away from the
our engines going through this so around
sides of my face and onto my neck
obviously going to get a little bit that
product if it's a very warm arm off a
bit coral tone bronze so outside today
it's driving me insane
long-term coral bronze it just really
warms up my favorite features especially
when I wear this eyeshadow look which
I'll mention in a second I feel to work
really well together because terms so
yeah big satellite pharmacy gorgeous I
love this right now everything I'm using
everyday okay then it's turn for
highlight and I'm really looking this
one right now the cover effects
moonlight I'm really love the reflects
drops they're fantastic but they take a
little bit more kind of applying so I
generally use those a lot specially when
it's just daytime I want to quickly
apply some highlights
powered is such a good go to and this
your apps are beautiful it really really
highlights illuminates face without
looking too powdery too cakey or too
kind of 50 shimmery it's just a really
lovely glow I find on the skin and I
highly recommend it if you're looking
for something that really captures light
that isn't extremely over-the-top like
the cover effects drop then I think
you'll really like this so big big fans
that right now
when it comes onto the eyes and I have
created this look and do this over
Fashion Week you may seen from my
pictures because I was wearing like a
green bodysuit and I thought it were
really nice about like a greeny blue
shimmery eye and I look to run on my
collection and realize I have one here
in the Amazonian clay palette again I
got this with my best friend in Chicago
she got this for me because I couldn't
get it any happy for really shimmery
shade suicide yes 16 matches just here
it's not such a beautiful palette and
when I finished got it I loved it
obviously it's stunning colors it's
great but I didn't use it all that much
and then now I discovered this I look
I'm absolutely obsessed and I realized
just how pigmented and amazing these are
especially is what I started doing is
using a quite flat brush like this one
from zoeva this is really
weasel looks classic shader brilliant
brush actually and it's so kind of
flattened it's perfect for packing our
products but I spray it first off with
the online Prima spray and you could use
any kind of makeup spray just to wet the
brush and then pack it onto there and
pack it on dry lips get rid of a bit of
the excess but honestly I was applying
it I didn't get any fallout at all
anyway but maybe up to six hours passing
it off all the time so this is
absolutely incredible as a Louie green
metallic shades stunning and there are
two the crease I go in with a few
different mixtures as a very
transitional light brown tan and then
this whimsy color which is very
terracotta orange around its absolute
beautiful I work that over the crease
absolutely love it it just works really
really well
so this palette is a gem and I'm
absolutely obsessed so I'm loving this I
look right now it really works my eye
color and I've never gone and I look
like this one it really comes missing an
eye spot I feel yeah so big big fans and
in the final beauty product to mention
which to pull them out sweet favorite
first of all the bare minerals liner in
borderline Jim nude eyeliner and
borderline wonderful very nudie light
shade with a bit of pink tone and this a
loli love the lips looks absolutely
amazing so I go in with that always fit
and then this is what I've been wearing
the past few weeks
daily absolutely daily so if you've seen
a picture of me recently and you wonder
what lipstick it was it was this
it's a deal bucket addict and I was
taking to LA for the last pint this
which is insane in the first place it
was UPS incredible I'm a society or as
you probably know if you follow me
everywhere I've been on studio trips and
just absolutely loved that team but this
is their brand new product and I think
it's out so soon it might be on America
already but these are just really
pigmented pigmented but with almost a
bit of a sheer feel while offering lots
of color and it's very barmy it's very
hydrating I feel it really plumps my
lips because the way it shines it catch
the light it's not shiny and sticky it's
just it just bounces right off
everything it's just this beautiful glow
to the formula and I'm just absolutely
obsessed so you still love the matte lip
totally still that still but this is
only a thickness you I think this kind
of formula with this gorgeous satin
shine
that's it shine not something
calling it it's just absolutely
beautiful it really in health is my lips
okay I can wear this all day and not
need to apply a bomb in between because
it's so hydrating and that makes me feel
a B so honestly I can't tell you how
much to love this this shade is bel-air
and it's the lightest one it's a very
nude shade it's not got much pink in it
at all it's a beige nude but I find your
the top of the pink liner it just I
can't tell you how much you love it and
I'm almost I'm almost kind of down and
I've only got this much less now that's
how much shopping you set or set so
that's the safe that's kind like my
everyday look right now I know this is
quite kind of stalled up from everyday
look but I'm just obsessed with it so
moving on perfumes life at the moment
and can we talk about this bottle first
of all this is the Armani Prive Rouge
malachite sense it's Mike senses it's
not a general kind of fragrance that you
can get everywhere it's on special
Armani counters
it's their special blend perfumes at all
the big fashion houses have like your
schnell and Armani they have these
incredibly I'm Tom Ford they have the
super special private blend pregnancies
and this is one of those so it's not
something that you probably want to buy
all the time because it's not exactly
super inexpensive but it's a very very
special perfume and I can't tell you
just how much I delicious it's not as
kind of swampy sense you know that you
can kind of get anywhere it's very
unique it's mature without being too
mature it cannot very like date night
sex you smell is that confident woman
smell I feel you know it's not mature in
that way it's more confident woman likes
to skate in one the other thing is
smelling someone I think like that girl
have her you know a chai tea together
you know that kind of smell and that's
why I really like it I feel like a
really I don't really helping my
confidence and from there it smells kind
of smell I think it's absolutely
beautiful so honestly have a little
smell at these when you go into some
stores or if you start seeing I treat
yourself somethin amazing I think you
will adore this I think it's just
amazing
oh okay this has transformed my hair
recently and I could not wait to talk to
you about it really where it come out
and shower and it's the sweat dripping
all over my bed but it is the read care
extreme mega mask at the feeling like my
hair really needs a good hydrating
Norris's like it was not in feeling its
best and
have massively helped the texture are
literally a single site drying my hair
I've noticed the biggest difference so
this is treatment and care extender for
distressed hair so it's perfect for me
it's got protein complexes in it it look
II just really bangs for hair again so
I'm shampooing my hair
I'll also conditioned my hair and then
I'll slather this all over not in the
rooms but over lips the length of my
hair and mainly on the ends and leave it
five minutes I think you can leave it
yeah well it says three to five minutes
when hours give it five just to give it
a little bit extra and isolate the
condition now feels insane in comparison
yeah I was just looking for something
that could really shake up my routine
and this is it like a really
professional brand product this really
enhance everything big-time and the last
area I wanna mention is this styler from
GHD this is come at their conical wrong
styler think it's kind of really new and
although I often kind of show you me
doing it here I'm going to be washing my
hair later and just prefer not to curl
my hair and distress it if I don't need
me to so I'm really sorry
so whether island fit for pictures here
of me when I did my hair with it and all
I did was roughly I wanted really
lightweight to Thals curls
I don't went to the beach you it isn't
to be killed but there were really a
massage dropping out so I just tied my
hair around this and then I pulled it
off I pulled my hair
almost like it's straight and like what
it it's it's curling it but being like
straighter and it meant that it was
really extending the curl so they
weren't so conical they were just way
too expensive out so try that such good
tip honestly it it worked wonders and it
just meant everything with my long
native we just have this little cone and
as you can see in the picture so I'd
only mention how much I love this this
is like my new favorite wand when it
comes to creating that kind of look it's
so good and I'll see in this video I
don't actually have any like new in
products to talk to you about I mean the
morning Laura I've not been using as
much that's kind of much more new my
routine to get up more of my new winds
but yeah I do already have as many kind
of like new wind to talk about or else
it'll be super long but I will next time
so I will move into fashion force gets
extremely lengthy
first fashion piece I wanna mention that
I showed you my last video are these
Malone three animals North Malone Juliet
mules they are stunning metallic gold
rose gold and
so self attack with black feature and
they fit wonderfully they are super
comfortable for walking and I think I'm
gonna get so much wear out of these this
year they're just absolutely stunning
they're very statement shoes I've got
something about them that's very unique
and I'm just absolutely look at them a
jacket that I wanted to mention is this
one it's brand-new from All Saints
forgetting to buy my new in product I've
won a couple of times now and can't show
you how much I adore this these ox loads
sections over the shoulders with the
white piping just set this off and
really make the colors look beautiful
scales back with this little pop of like
a deep color it just breaks it up from
you know really this ordinary black
leather jacket and I mean All Saints is
notorious for doing the most beautiful
jackets anyway when it comes to leather
jackets I also love we've got the sporty
feel to the very bottom with a striping
it goes around to each side which is
over top by the way
got this light out my water over the top
inside it yeah I really love these 40
right to the very bottom from stripe and
it's just something I know I'm gonna
wear to death out to love it I love it
with this I makeup look as well commit
something a bit kind of grungy about it
and that's it I love it another huge
favor that I got so many compliments
from accounting to tell you are these
all fakes channel two again I want for
Fashion Week
they're Navy with this black stripes of
each leg the more wide leg while still
being quite flattering and they just fit
really really well if you're looking for
a wider leg trouser that you can still
well with heels and tuck things into it
so it's a really like stunning
silhouette then think these it might be
for you and honestly offsets of them are
put in a picture again that I wore
demand the other day when I went out to
an event and I got so many compliments
when supposed to mention how much I
adore these and finally this jacket is
an absolute dream this is from club Mike
oh look at these sleeves otherwise it's
a very light ivory kind of cream shade
stunning little collar like this and
just goes down no buttons to something
kind of throw on over your outfit to
make it look quite just going to import
together splits these sleeves that I'm
just absolutely just loving two pieces
of silver ute aful and whenever I wear
as Jackie Alice I get so many
compliments people being like how pretty
is this jacket and it looks like it'll
go with everything and it really really
does it's not too long
not too sure and it's very sweet and
very sophisticated so amused she's
trying to have to mention it and I feel
