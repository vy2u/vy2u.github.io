all doing so so well as you can see this
is going to be a festival look
it helps us ping Glastonbury but there
are so many more festivals this summer
and the figure if you are going to one
and you want a really simple easy look
to do try to keep the products minimal I
try to keep it quite easy and especially
the hair is super easy but these little
flecks of pink running through it
I really really love it the overall look
I am so happy with I did film this box
before the other day
totally scrapped excited not like the
finished look and I'm absolutely in love
with this one okay guys this is the
roughest of philic I've looked in quite
some time and complete honesty but I'm
just going to go with it I need to turn
I need to turn my hair around about skin
day oh I figured this was pretty
realistic to how it's going to be when
you are susceptible and trying to get
ready so I'm going to go through
something quite easy boho vibe I'm also
not going to using curlers or
straighteners because you're not going
to have any power source and you tell
it'll ask you in a special TP which case
goes for you that sounds awesome
I'm just going to work with what I have
here with my hair just very natural hair
so sign off with some dry shampoo I feel
this is like the festival Saviour using
L'Oreal clay to spray dry shampoo now
also swap so give us a bit Margaret as
well in a bit more volume it were
putting a few little sort of like plat
into here that are just kind of like in
the midst of my hair and super messy
okay getting down to the button I'm just
going to use some of the Loreal Elnett
this is a glam wave supreme hold so it's
great for like wavy hair cells and curl
and whatnot it's also great due to the
hole that it has like a bit of this
comes here like MATLAB down because then
we don't have to use in needles case one
could put a few more roses
also don't I make these to tank so do go
a little bit rigid
I'm going to put walnuts one just down
here just a bit lower you know slightly
different platforms bit tight I want a
bit looser once I start I like further
down and I might discard one last one
actually through here because I feel
like you've got to see this it's going
to do it now on this side the foot okay
so I'll just put a few little plants in
and now I'm just going to take a little
bit of the front and just pin it back
and same on the other side it's very
boho right now and unliking it I'm going
to put one more plan here actually
because I get a quick you also it might
be worth just asking friend of yours to
do a very very back section if you have
a few plots also going through the back
of your hair you can do it yourself but
they'll be harder okay so nothing too
over top or like ridiculous it's going
to use a little bit more of the brown
way of hairspray and just for some added
grit and extra kind of volume also going
to go in with the creme de mousse this
is also in the ground wave little bit of
that I love these noises I'll actually
use some every time that I wash and dry
my hair I'm just going to put like a
little bit into here a little bit more
just want like more of a textured messy
look when you could do this with a
texture spray as well but not the doing
in the mousse and again I'd touch more
of it okay and the finishing touch here
and a bit grab it north on is the
L'Oreal color Easter sprays here I've
got in pink hair but I also have
possibly hair which I am thinking about
but with this being like all pink and
quiet cutesy I thought I was going to go
with the pink there's like seven
different shades to choose from though
everything that's so good about the use
of it's like one day color spray it in
wash it out the next day wash it out
like it looks you just takes one wash
out and it's completely gone
even on my hair color as well I've used
this a few times now and it should just
come straight out in the first flush so
it's perfect and which is going to take
a little amount I spent to be quite
pastel and spray it into some of these
plants okay
I decided actually a towel would be a
good idea here I'm gonna put my off my
shoulders if I can get it right a little
hint you got this drama and it love to
build at the chloral a bit more but I've
like to the
quite passed up quite simply a bit more
kind of gradient can you see that these
little spritzes of pink and we can also
do but the an amount you can it at the
ends I'll see if I can all tower for
this just a little bit of color I said I
could go a lot more heavy but I think
this luck I just want to be quite subtle
and quite cute little billions a little
bit very mine to use an old towel here
helps me I'll come out your towels as
well but just be careful okay I love it
it's quite subtle and really cute and
your CDs like little sparks and flashes
of color coming through after you can go
is outrageous and fun if you like but it
is just about like having fun with
colors I love you so much so let's play
around it different colors of green
silver there's peach really really good
fun so I love that okay let's get on to
the nature I'm just going to do really
quick skincare routine my skin feels
absolutely awful
I think I've had a reaction to something
unfortunately and it's not feeling good
it's like got loads a little bumps
underneath it and a second on Charlotte
Tilbury eye cream some limit theorem
anything that's going to really really
hydrate your skin all this depends how
many products you want to take with you
on your fistful trip but Chanel
moisturizer okay now can make a start on
the makeup the idea of gone for this is
to keep the product amount to a very
very minimum so that your makeup bag
isn't boring and you can get this tool
in the quickest way possible so you're
actually spending time out in the
festival and not in your tent doing your
makeup so these are kinda products that
I would be using and quite frankly I
think I've got some goodness for you
going to start off with the it cosmetics
CC cream just because SPF 50 in there
just perfect for festivals if you're
outside all day I'm using a mixture of
light and first on in between terms
right now just gonna just pull this on
to my face hate putting make a polymer
heads down news must pursue sleep room
now it's just wonderful coverage and
really love the finish it's quite a
radiant glowing finish
plus you can also now by the CC cream in
the UK so it's all linked down below as
if every other product that I'm using CC
cream down I'm gonna move into concealer
now soft matte concealer in Canal is my
one and only right now and it's just so
so quick so I figured I'd go with
something really quick for this rather
than immediately saucy I just feel so
way in if I maybe need to change my
liking
okay hopefully that's better and it's
going to hit the Beauty Blender all over
my face just to blend in any edges any
more product soap onto alcoholic uncle
powder I'm going to go in with the
indicate naked skin shapeshifter because
hello amazing palette it's got
everything in one palette
I also has a side which is creams gonna
go in first of all with the contour
shade just on any brush that you've got
a little contouring it's going to use
this makeup forever brush I just want to
make this look really good oh my do just
look good just to make it really
gorgeous and glowy but I'm going fast
and just contouring around the size of
my face yeah I'm surprised I can
actually see myself as mirror it's so
dear to all the news little bit yeah
that's funny cause I think glowing so a
lot in life going to go in a little bit
of bronzer I'm just going to take that
top shade for the bronzer it's very
lovely and more if you like that take a
bit Dominic and this around those temple
within the for everything up even more
so because that's one console I almost
want like Pocahontas sides at the
festival you know just like glowy
magnificent I mean I definitely got her
hair on this just reduce it down a
little bit
it's easy fix just blend blend blend
we've got a powder in the places I need
it with this one right here this is a
really really great powder actually set
very very nice little the eyelids and
the most exciting part this palette is
the highlight just watch this it's
honestly so beautiful find the glare
whoo quite so beautiful and you stir I
mean if you don't like too much
highlight then you don't have to I like
a good highlight it's going to start a
little bit bit ease on my lips because
perhaps later tell us about how quick is
it so far a little bit of blush I'm
going to go in with the L'Oreal True
Match highlight which I really love is a
very pink cutesy blush but any kind of
pink shimmery blush you have will be
perfect I'm going for glowy and got some
pink okay now for eyeshadow I'm going to
use two pallets lift the Anastasia
Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance and the
amazing Kat Von D Alchemist holographic
palette this longer start off with the
Anastasia Beverly Hills and I'm just
going to take two really easy transition
colors red orange and wanto all over the
crease overdone Outsiders but hey how it
works is just a really easy Mac two one
seven brush which is like my favorite
brush as I saw my shadow I'm just
creating a bit of a cat eye with that
crease mainly so through the grease and
then just wings down because you know me
just feel like when you do this with
your crease first it just maps out your
eye shape so when you go in with more
colors kind of helps you know where to
go where not to go which is great that's
good enough we're going to go in later
with even more product right when I go
in for the Kat Von D holographic palette
and I'm absolutely obsessed with these
colors this one down here this pink opal
almost looks like a creamy shade and
then it catches away it's like a
metallic pink it's incredible so I'm
going to go in with that with a flat
brush so I can not really pack it on
since the most insane color and I really
hope it picks up on camera just how
amazing that is by the way guys this is
the second time I filmed this if you
know I feel miss white last week I got
all edited and got it already and I just
wasn't happy with it at all like I
didn't like how I've done my hair I did
my hair completely differently today and
I wasn't keen on some of the things I
used so I thought it's done again
because I just wasn't happy with it so
if you've been watching our vlogs and
you saw me talking about a festival look
that was meant to do that two weeks ago
then yeah it was scrapped but this is
the new one I also can't get over
how incredible is eyeshadow is it's
absolutely beautiful and I really wish
you could see those colors coming out I
really hope you can because it's so
pretty and the thing a look as well
about this one is this gorgeous lavender
here okay I hope this shows up on camera
but look at this part though it's oh my
gosh it's just insane can you see that I
can't actually get over that okay now
back to my Anastasio palette and I'm
going to go in now with a mixture of
these two gorgeous pinks because it's
going to make it a bit more pink around
the crease take and growth on the brush
and then just go and straight over that
crease again starting using a lot of
product on the outer corner especially
some on to be a little bit darker and
again there's a triangular shape here
and then we can get across different
Asia the exact shadows is incredible you
just kind of go back to the palette and
just top that off and make sure that
it's definitely running out in there
total of 5 just almost a bit halo eye
effect something really a cereal about
it really really love it because it is
quite a cereal I spent a little bit of
eyeliner I haven't used eyeliner in so
long actually I'm going to use it Urban
Decay alkaline 24/7 glide on pencil so
now we're also like deep for me Shane I
thought it would just really complement
all the purples I'm just going to go
along this upper lash line a little bit
I've tortured it in here
love this color it's going to use an
angled brush to sort of rub that along
to help blend it in a tiny bit I'm just
pushing it out at the end of this pretty
little bit of a flick do my tight line
going to the other eye totally in love
with that cotton so mascara you need a
little curl and I'm going to use the
L'Oreal false lash sculpt I adore this
mascara just get right into those roots
just for something quite flattering
I've also supply a little bit to my
outer corners at the lower lashes not
all over just to the outer corners ok
for my brows I'm going to my usual
concoction alex is loving right now so
I'm just going to
brush up my brows I'm going to use the
Anasazi at beverly hills dipbrow and
chocolate no I do is just draw out the
tail top and bottom join those together
fill in a tiny bit a little four strokes
nothing too heavy brush up through and
then the front of it I'm going to see
Tom Ford just like it Wow brush and
brush up all this front section upwards
honestly when you put this Tom Ford
stuff on it does not budge all day it's
what you like brow hairs bro making it
Bush yeah pushing it up giving it color
I say such a women it's a love it much
figure and OSHA and the way I like them
okay just going to move on to some lips
now and I'm going to use bare minerals
Jen nude in freestyle things this just
to get a bit of definition on line those
red eyes and then some actual collapse
with the L'Oreal number one on three
through the coloration matte blush in a
Russian it's my favorite of the new maps
and I just like to Pat that in just a
little bit of color just to set
everything we Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray okay just one little
finishing touch I'm going to add a
little bit more eyeliner just to the
outer lower lash line just for a little
bit more definition
