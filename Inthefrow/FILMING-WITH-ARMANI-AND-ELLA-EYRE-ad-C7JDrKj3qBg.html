epic location this is going to be quite
fun one
I'm pretty excited about it today I am
kind of behind the scenes backstage on
the set of a new Emporio Armani Club
fragrance with Ella Eyre and all the
team and all of the employer Manatee and
we're doing filming for a brand new kind
of digital film really really exciting
I'm hoping I'm gonna be in a cameo in a
second film hopefully after that that's
been really really good fun so I'm going
to go into and get my kind of hair
makeup done and hopefully I'm gonna be
wearing something from Armani so that
this is just amazing it's just an update
beautiful day beautiful location it's an
area customer stand minute Park I think
near Brighton and it's this incredible
like big mansion house incredible
location so I'm gonna really sort of
bringing you backstage around the scenes
showing us and it's going on and yeah
let's get it
so this is my whole outfit how cute is
this it has lovely and clearly clamped
these are the most amazing cute little
Armani shoes
and my makeup look so cool so you guys
know how much I love shows my mouth you
makeup elbows and all my makeup done
without talking about it so my class is
gonna be cool a little bit so you guys
can hear our conversation
I'll meet you kind of talk me through
what you love as collecting I love so
much I kind of want to hear what you
like the most
I was quite surprised to like to like so
much bit to be honest just because I
must admit my knowledge of makeup has
grown you know still not like totally
there so that when I started using like
for instance my favorite is one of the
foundations that I stray because I don't
really like to wear too much makeup so
it's like it kind of gets rid of all the
blemishes and it makes a nice layer in
your face evens it all out without
feeling completely caked with makeup
yeah so it's really light I'm really
fresh which I really like yeah they are
like maestro I do really like maestro oh
you tried my stroke though no I haven't
because when it separates when the one
you're not easy as I don't know what to
do but I think the thing I realized is I
would like to be makeup yes let's see
skin like blow yeah and I really love
this is really good coverage and what
doesn't keep your skin yes
but then this it's like extra light
super glowy because with this without
being our like PR on you they feel fine
there's like five oils and this I think
so it goes me if you're scared but I
love oil content which creates up doing
it yeah and then it evaporates over the
day and leaves your skin does something
incredible so do you use that without
mark yeah I just use this I'll look up
and wearing that today I'm young enough
to give that go whatever without it it's
so beautiful
it's why you choose a sponge with that
Oh brushes are amazing I can't bring
myself to use just because you know when
I like to wash my brushes quite a lot
but then I don't know yeah yeah but with
these kiss is so good you do need to
wash them with Johnson's baby shampoo I
wish you went out and bought that just
believe that's a good tip family use
that because I think I'm not sure what
kind of hair it is it's like super
gentle hair really suffer them but if
they do wash with a perfectly they are
amazing that I feel like on your skin
they're so soft they don't feel too
harsh even if you've got really
sensitive skin so I do yeah
I really do like the bronzer I don't
really wear that much bronzer but it
does add a bit of color especially if
you're feeling slightly under the
weather
do you yeah at times I'm like I'm thing
as I've never really known how to I've
always either gone way too much way too
little so I deliberately go away soon
anyway
Kareem um but it is a really lovely
Carlo it's just quite warm it's not too
intense I haven't used their you know
it's really lovely I do love the
lipsticks these are my favorite colors I
have to go there see I'm I've just
mainly got red ones I really like
they've got so many different tones of
red yeah you can't have too many watch
Rocka red lip light day today well you
know just because one thing I love about
red lips is that you can wearing it to
do nothing else yeah yeah you know maybe
a bit of makeup foundation or something
light on the skin but then you don't
need anything else with a red lip
because it's that much of a statement
that you could just go no no mascara no
eyebrows really thick just just just
rock a red lip on its own I love that
yeah super confident that's right
or because you might know employer Marty
has the connection with music they
always have done so it's kind of really
good collaboration between employer
money and our she's really bored from
the cold so it's just a really really
good bet she's so lovely it's been so
fun working on there now that I'm down
sipping to little bits like kings rose
recorded function
and ice it we are in our taxi going back
to London so I've got a couple of hours
drag right now we had no idea it's going
to be such a massive like production
level and but the weather was incredible
the setting location was just brilliant
we've had so much fun and I cannot wait
to see the final film because I really
have no idea I've been so many bits with
it so I really hope you guys liked it
when it comes out I'm sure I'd be quite
cool the way the shutter yes it's been
an incredible like curdled a really cool
experience
believe I'll leave the film down below
so you can click it click the link and
go and watch it if you think but you
might have already seen it right now I
leave all exam below as well so
