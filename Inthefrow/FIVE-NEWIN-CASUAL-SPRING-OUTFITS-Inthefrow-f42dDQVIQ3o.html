style video I mentioned in my previous
video which was my spring stereo mix
that I'd got so inspired I had like 10
11 outfits and things try them all on
and also I'm just going to split this
into two videos I'm afraid so this is
kind of like part two in a way but it's
just all about spring style I know that
I'm now super inspired but all these
outfits I found in my wardrobe but
hopefully you will be too so enough with
if you are brand new here I'd absolutely
love it if you subscribed I'll leave
links down below you can subscribe to my
channel I would love to have you but
anyone else have seen me before thanks
for being here again yeah let's just
jump into this video so there's gonna be
five different spring outfits mainly
things that are brand new into my
wardrobe so I'm gonna kick this off with
this little cutie I love this dress it's
so beautiful I am a big fan of Rick so I
think their prints the quality of their
fabrics are absolutely stunning it
always usually silks I'm not sure off to
do any others but the majority are in
silk fabrics and they're always just
such a beautiful quality this is a
really pretty mini dress
v-neck really deep v-neck but the thing
with Rick's though is they're not really
gaping there isn't loads of room so you
don't feel like you're gonna fall out of
it which is what I absolutely love about
it you have a little bit more cleavage
on show without feeling like your boobs
are gonna pop out of it so big big fun
so this is a big winner this season for
me to make this a little bit more
chilled a bit more daytime appropriate I
threw on this brand new denim jacket I
love this very light wash of this I
think it's just really really wearable
for the spring yeah it's just an
absolutely gorgeous color and a slightly
longer length not really long but I find
a lot of denim jackets can be quite
cropped this is a slightly longer length
but I find it that works for so many
different styles as well I'm a big fan
of this it's quite casual I mean you
could throw this over so many different
types of dresses and just pare them down
a little bit and that's kind of what I
did with the Rick so dress and just to
accessorize so I can have played on the
very light wash grey blues of a jacket
and I went for my Dior bag I love this
bag so much it's honestly one of the
best things I've ever bought it's one of
my most expensive bags with it being
Dior but honestly it's been such an
incredible investment I have worn it
today I absolutely adore it so I just
thought this matched really really
nicely with this dress and just meant I
could pull this back out my wardrobe
again and really liked that dress as
well because I felt it
with the studying of the Valentino's
these are a pair of Valentino sandals
I'm a big big fan of volunteer sandals
are so comfortable I wear them until
they're literally falling apart so we
got myself a new pair this one being
with this roping around the edges
they're quite an elegant sophisticated
sandal and I know I'm gonna get so much
wear out of these bad boys
so I put this together with the whole
outfit and again you just kind of pulled
the elegance of the dress down a little
bit into a more casual style but you
could quite easily wear this dress with
an incredible pair of super hi rich red
heels and think about my Christian
Louboutins here and they would look
amazing with this dress okay so that was
outfit number one outfit number two is
this cute little top I've literally the
Scott list today I think it's beautiful
even alex is like that's pretty so if he
says so I know that it said good bye is
this a very sweet striped cami top
really but I like the details off the
buttons and then at the back it crosses
at the back with a bow and then kind of
elastic 8 as well so it's a little bit
more going on to this top then may meet
the eye I just figured this would go
with so many different things it would
go with white jeans really really nicely
but I've heard it was I paired it with
this brand new pair of shorts that I
bought the other week from the support a
these are perfect Alice and Olivia
shorts and of course because he's in
blues and whites it just worked really
really nicely with a deep rich navy of
these shorts they've got this gold
buttons for a little bit more detail but
they also have buckets which is why out
so it's always short I think they're
amazing they're a great length they
don't ride up your bomb which is amazing
so they're very kind of sophisticated
elegant sure that you can again you can
wear these with heels for a night out
for an evening out a date night that
sort of thing or you could just wear
them in the day but a little cami like
this as I've shown them and it makes it
a little bit more cash but as you guys
know I am a fan of heels whether it be
in the spring I'm not really wearing its
money boots so I've gone for my Chanel
mules
he's one of my most worn pair of heels
I'm really sure you can still find these
in different Chanel boutiques they have
variations now as well if you were
thinking of picking up a pair but I
cannot recommend these more they're so
comfortable they don't come off your
feet
honestly when I'm amongst a lot
pair of shoes and I thought they looked
really really cute with this whole
outfit and just for any days they're a
little bit more cool any competent work
wear the Kami I mean we're not quite in
summer we're talking spring here guys
and this is London so I paired it not
with this t-shirt but with this jacket
this jacket is from Rhys and it's
actually from last season but they do
these jackets every single season and
the resource aints especially do these
gorgeous suede jackets
this one is in a blush blush is huge
again the season especially for guys but
yeah I just thought this looked really
lovely over the top of this outfit a
gray suede will look - awesome black
suede if not a white denim jacket with
this look would be so gorgeous I just
don't own one but yeah but I put it with
this and I'm really loved it together I
thought it looked really really cute and
just accessorize again just to go with
the Chanel meals I wore the Chanel flat
bag super easy and just worked really
nice with the coolest I thought yeah as
I was filming I also saw it's Paris bar
man glasses sat on my desk and I was
like ooh it'll be kind of nice to
accessorize so I threw these on as well
although I can barely see through them
because they have so much rubbish on the
lenses Wow okay from AK outfit to outfit
three okay this outfit is awesome it all
stems from this t-shirt
Levi's t-shirt I walk past this in the
day Nottingham it was on a mannequin and
me my friend were like let's go in and
look at this t-shirt and I'm absolutely
in love with it I love the fact it's
more of an oversized fit but also if you
just tuck in it makes it much more kind
of flattering my best mate also bought
this with a big big fans of it I just
love the retro vibe I'm a big fan of
Levi's anyway but this small retro vibe
is awesome so I had to get it like 30
quid so it's not too bad for Levi's
t-shirt I have to give complete props
though to another content creator
I know called Naomi her Instagram is
rocío underscore style she wore this
exact outfit in LA recently and I was
like I am obsessed I messaged her online
and was like this is the most amazing
outfit so this is totally inspired by
her I love it so she paired that t-shirt
with a pair of yellow trials it's now I
don't know which one she got but I found
these on ASOS and love this bright that
bright canary yellow it's awesome
they're really highway
stood to think the color is so so cool I
love the fact that Lamar okay like a
cigarette trouser vibe
they're quite short they're a little bit
more cropped at the bottom they're not
too long length so any shoes you wear
with them kind of really stand out it's
a little slit as well to the bottom of
each leg for a little more shape but
they're just a really cool pair of
trousers and they have pockets too so
I've got those on a sauce I think so I
found those I think they work really
really well so huge props to Naomi for
inspiring me with this outfit I thought
it looked so cool how she wore it so
then I also again I threw on this denim
jacket just to work with they're very
cool very kind of pastel tones I thought
this worked pretty well it's a light
jacket and because belt bags are
literally all the rage right now I had
to get my belt bag in here this is brand
new Chloe belt bag I Wallis around India
but I wasn't wearing any belt loops so I
didn't think I could wear it but I found
it a lot was looking at this in my
collection once I actually it doesn't
really need about logo and actually it
doesn't the tightest hole on this works
to sell my hip so it's not gonna go
anywhere anyway so paired it with this
and I actually absolutely love the style
it worked nicely with the fact that
Levi's talks quite retro and belt bags
are somewhat rich as well even though
they so huge this season so I brought
this back thought it worked really
really cool especially the gold with the
yellow and again just to match the
yellow tones
I brought my Nicholas Kirkwood's out
again there's such an easy pair of shoes
to wear so comfortable and I love the
shade I've got these in this color which
is more of a cool gold I also have the
rose gold it's more of a warm gold
so I'll mix it up but they're just one
of my favorite pairs of shoes yeah I
must admit absolutely adore not fair
it's so cute okay so moving on to outfit
number 4 that's with this new top that I
got from whistles this is as always for
spring the Bardot tops come back in full
force
and this is such a gorgeous one this is
in a linen it's really lightweight it's
perfect to be going on holiday and
something really easy to throw on it's
quite cute that it's got these little
bows to go over over the size of your
shoulders and it has tiny little sleeves
it can be tucked in or it can be left
out either way but it's just a really
easy
lovely Bardot style for the spring but I
took I'm doing
skirt even got the tax on this a new
skirt that I got from River Island I
really like the fact this is so
distressed you've got some really cool
distress work around the hemline and on
both of the pockets so this is quite
cool beaten-up style skirt just a very
simple denim style but worked really
nicely with this chart but it's tucked
it all in made it look quite flattering
on the figure but then just a pop the
color
I added my favorite red jacket I need to
take off this like in the last video I
just really love that so the colors work
- really nicely with this I love denim
colors with red and especially this red
it's just such a gorgeous like tomato
red this is such a cute little piece and
love it I'm pretty sure it's still in
stock obviously it's gonna be linked
down below so paired that with that as
well for shoes I thought that these
worked perfectly with this outfit my new
do shoes again really comfortable I'm so
glad I bought these I think you're gonna
see these a lot this summer spring
summer I think a lot of people are gonna
buy these I'm so glad that I fought and
cuz I think they're amazing I've so many
compliments on them already they're
really comfortable they don't slip off
your feet they're just a really cute
sophisticated flat I mean you know that
I like pointy shoes so these were a
winner as soon as I saw them and loved
them and then just to kind of finish off
the casual vibes I paired it with my
little backpack my Chloe backpack this
is still in stock that comes in so many
different colors and also I think
there's also a larger size this is just
like the mini version I'll leave the
actual one down below for you just in
case it's very similar to my little belt
bag slightly different style of Chloe
but very similar deep navy but I love
the gold work with gold
studying on there it's just such a cute
little backpack and with this outfit I
thought it was added completely to the
whole look and last but not least this
outfit is a little more a little bit
more evening appropriate but it could be
more daytime as well but the way I
wanted it to be this because I've shown
you like for more casual outfits to show
you one that's a little more evening
appropriate so it all kind of stems
around these trousers pair of white
palazzo trousers that my mate got me to
even it Bessie does my eighth fall they
are such a winner I wore these all the
way around India they were actually
perfect for index they're a bit longer
length but also really lightweight when
we take these on my next trip as well on
Friday they're just
a great shape the quite flattering but I
wanted to see if I could kind of wear
these in a slightly different way you
could quite easily tuck this in just
have a white team took this in for
daytime pair of sandals you like a
little tiny cropped denim jacket and it
would be awesome but I wanted to make it
a little bit more evening so I paired it
with my christian dior bra now if you
didn't get the christian dior bra off
you don't want to spend this amount of
money on a tiny piece of fabric like I
did then also there are so many other
can little bra tops you could find
around I'm sure there are so many dupes
now that have cool little straps at this
I'm sure I've seen quite a lot but the
fact this is black and white works so
well with the black and white the
trousers and the fact these are high
waisted when you wear this you don't
feel like you've got like too much
midriff on show it's just got a little
flirt in between this and the bra so it
just works really nicely
I love these together so the black and
white theme I carried on also through
the accessories I paired it with these
River Island Holly Fulton shoes I'm not
worn easy on these heels they're really
cool they're so blinging they've got all
this embellishment all the way up the
back stem of the shoe and on the toe
they're really cool high style as you
know I'm a big big fan of that
and I thought elevate to this outfit
made it a little bit more kind of
nighttime elegant and but also a little
bit more blingy so I thought they
weren't really nice and go with the
silver and the black and that whole vibe
I then went with a Jimmy Choo lock it
back with all of this embellishment this
is what am I like most worn bags at the
moment I think it's a suit so so cool
and again I've got loads of compliments
on this but boy I'm pretty sure it stops
I'll leave a link topically but yeah
worked really well with the
embellishment on the shoes the
embellishment on the bag and then the
black and white throughout the entire
theme throughout the entire theme
I thought with crack you outfit I think
that's it five right yeah okay so that
was my five spring outfit I really
really hope you enjoyed it if you
