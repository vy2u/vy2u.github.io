overdue video on a video I've been
really excited about filming this is
going to be my home where Furniture Hall
slash home tour me nights have been out
and about finding lots of different
piece of furniture and little trinkets
and homewear pieces and I really really
wanted to show them to you and share
them with you so without further ado
let's get into the whole seeing as we're
in the bedroom I'm going to start off
with everything sort of bed related
starting off with the cushions and
pillows I've always wanted so many like
big fluffy pillows and cushions to kind
of make this very cozy big bed almost
looks like it has got loads of things
going up so I got loads of new pieces
these are H&amp;amp;M I went to H&amp;amp;M in Westfield
the thing and they had these cushions I
can't find them online I'll try and link
some similar ones down below for you but
ya thought these were really cute and
these are just H now but then the main
things on the bed come from a store
called Christy online and they do lows
with beddings
rose cushions these cushions are from
Christie's it's like a really cool white
quilted pattern and they're so big sweet
in a kind of cushion and the cushion
cover are both from Christie and because
I wanted to throw I got the matching
throw that goes with the cushions we
have to sit down in the bed and this is
Hugh and it's so thick it's absolutely
beautiful I love it so have the cushions
and then we have the pillows so the
pillows and the pillowcases again are
from Christie's they're just those
really huge huge pillows but little
super soft super cozy and I have two of
those on the bed and the cushion and the
H&amp;amp;M cushion so there's a lot going on
here but now I've got the cushions off
now you can actually speed the bed and
the bed frame
this bed is from next and again I want
you tomorrow my kind of princess bed
something very white quite regal looking
and quite cute so this is what I found
and we
absolutely love it the whole frame is
white in the bed frame at the back is
just so pretty
can you see that so it goes along about
the thing on the back is almost like a
lettuce wall protected that was already
here and I know that kind of looks like
the bed frame and I kind of like that
it's almost like a double bed frame but
we are also thinking we may take it off
but for now this is the bed and the side
tables are also from next and they match
with the bed so that's exactly why I
want to vendor suits like a full set
so I've two of those outside this is
Alex's cause this little cactus family
going on from different captures with I
bought from Ikea or we even took some
from a recent friend's wedding she has
so many to like take them take them and
the lights are from the white company
again I kind of felt like I needed tall
mum so a thoughtful small lamps would
look a little bit tiny compared to all
these massive cushions so use something
a bit taller so we're going to have one
on either side of the bed moving in to
the kind of lounge living space we have
my absolute pride and joy this is a Smeg
fridge freezer I always always wanted a
Smeg fridge and there's one at the gleam
head offices and I was like it's amazing
so I looked myself and I found this
table with the fridge with the freezer
on the top and the fridge on the bottom
so we don't actually have much in the
freezer right now peace everyone has
peace and we've got some like corn mints
think in there and lots of ice like ice
and the fridge I mean please don't judge
us on this it's a bit of a kind of cram
everything in we don't care where
everything goes but lots and lots little
goodies my favorite innocent coconut
water which is just about we've got
things for tear making a lovely Cod dish
for dinner so that's everything but look
how much space that is it's super cute
this is a pastel blue shade I leave the
exact number down below off the kind of
model of this because there are so many
and I don't even realize how big this
would be when it came but I love it so
much I'm so glad I went for it and by
the way the fridge
in this kind of area of the room rather
than the kitchen because it's just a
little bit too big so we've put it here
and then for dining room area which is
literally right next to the fridge this
came with the flat this table not too
sure with us from about trying to find
out if I can but these chairs are ours
these came from Ikea and we got four of
them obviously because in case we have
some guests Mickey Minnie I'm
permanently here always and this plant
literally this plant I must've had about
six seven years and it still somehow
going strong usually I've have some
beautiful peonies on here cuz I'm
actually obsessed with peonies when it's
summer and actually in season but we
don't have any today so instead we have
our beautiful plan here oh yeah these
Mikey are actually really quite
comfortable to sit on quite nice yeah I
thought they were lovely because this
space is quite small I didn't want
anything too obtrusive or too bright
instead I use the kind of more
see-through transparency off the chairs
just create a little bit more space I
guess okay so this is our like snug area
we like to call it snug Ralph in your
living room because it s is a little bit
smaller and with a little montemagno the
quantum flux are a little bit tinier so
this is our little space and we kind of
chill in the evenings and we love it is
very very cozy
my favorite thing in here is definitely
thanks said today although it's more of
a kind of a two-seater I think it's
called a lawn chair something like that
anyway we wanted something else in here
so that mean arts could be a bit more
comfy at night this came with the flat
so we just wanted something extra so we
got this from next there are so many
different kind of fabric so you can get
from next like I spent hours on there
choosing the fabric choosing the color
of the feet choosing the overall style
and this is where I like the most this
is what I went for it comes like a
really cool gray slate gray lots of
different tones the gray going through
it and I went for the dark brown feet on
it and also put into a little cushion
this throw my mom got me a years ago and
this in fact I think this is for next I
got this um Christmas off my dad I think
after next then moving into my side
tables these are from Oliver bonus and
they come as a set of two so it has a
marble top and it has rose gold legs on
this this is the larger of the two but I
just wanted something again it wasn't
too dark or you know I needed to fill
the space or something quite bright so I
love the marble top yeah it's quite
strong looking piece so on top of here
how amazing are these so many of you
told me where I could get these when I
found one it can but this is actually
one and as part of a set from Absolut
Vodka I think this is the absolute it
looks set and it comes with a bottle of
vodka and it comes with this and all the
proceeds of these go to water as well
which is awesome
so I wanted to get these this little
thing I got from like a garden center
show and garden centers who those lovely
little home where pieces so I don't
really know but I'll try and find one
online for you and these I went looking
for these I found them in TK Maxx
if you're in America that's can the
equivalent of TJ Maxx off firm sense so
I found some these came in a set for
like six pounds
I hope they go together so this is a
second table almost like nesting table
so sit together so yeah this is a second
one and I'm talking bit I have again I
just got this from a garden center but I
thought it was lovely put a handle in
there and last thing I picked up the
lounge at these cushions these are from
oliver bonus as well i've got them in
the light blue and the peach i thought
it'd be cute to have lots of color in
here so yeah they're just really great
cushions you come with the cushions as
well they can stuff them with the super
easy got lots of nice color on them yeah
i just got four of those keep them on
here just again just to brighten up the
whole place doh I bought the matching
Smeg for toaster and kettle to match the
fridge seeing as we want to buy them
anyway I thought why not go all out and
buy things that we'll be able to keep
for years and years to go with the
fridge so that's went all out and got
all of them they're actually brilliant
though they're actually really really
good quality the toast is granny you
know it's just super cute and it's the
kind of toaster that she pops out
throw your toms catch your toast it's
uses pop out super cute though and in
the little castle I do love it so much
it's really adorable so they were great
investments I'm super happy I got and
also a new cookbook that I am really
enjoying at the moment sort of I've been
trying to find new recipes for me and
Alex's a mix things up a bit when I'm
cooking this I really wanted to mention
this is such a lovely new book it's
called the social kitchen food family
and friends by Shelley Tucker and this
is written by the daughter of Shelley
Tucker
Charlie unfortunately passed away and
she was an amazing cook and Baker and
her daughter wanted to create a book of
all of her recipes so this is just a
most wonderful book and it's absolutely
gorgeous inside it's just one of those
perfect kind of books to have in your
kitchen
it's a wonderful story and yeah totally
in love with this right now
and the last thing in the kitchen that
is brand-new was actually bought for us
as a moving in gift from my best friend
Rebecca she got four tumblers and a
carafe she's trying to say something
about how much wine we drink with blue
well these are gorgeous again these from
our bonus
unlike turning into the biggest of a
bonus found recently hand washer lid oh
don't put me dishwasher are you pulling
ruin them that's like five pound each I
think and then you also have the carafe
this little matching set and also have
you seen this morg
this mug I mention at my snapshot I
think and a few of you asked me where
it's from and it's actually from
Disneyland Florida Disney well Florida
so if you are around there and going
then definite look out for these and I'm
sure probably Disneyland has them as
well it's actually baked I'll have some
what is my favorite mug ever and the
last things that we've got in the office
this thing being another Oliver burners
piece this is a cool frame a picture
commerce asses work hard play hard
be kind follows the perfect thing to
happen on my desk something I kind of
live by work your butt off but still
have fun so yeah all the bonus
everything else is kind of everything
I've had before apart from the chair
chair is brand-new for this I've got
from Staples I needed at desk chair
it's going to go to something white I
thought it'd be really nice an aesthetic
when I was like there are no white
chairs and actually economically correct
for you so this is really good on the
back so if you're someone who works at a
desk and you need a new chair that kind
of made sure that you got a good posture
and y'all hurt me back all day it's
actually really good the thing I love
about it is you can actually put down up
and down the arms so if you're quite fun
to desk you can put up the arms that's
for them in handy it's also really cool
thing and the other thing I'm going to
show you are these handles on my desk
he's just lightly different when I
bought the debt and because I've got so
much makeup Anissa got too heavy so I
actually end up pulling on the handles
laughter these are from Zara they come
to set - so I bought four and I've got
three of them but they're so pretty so I
redeem their a home that is due there
was a different types of handles
definitely worth checking out he got a
draw on a DIY project that needs to
handle they're gorgeous like five pounds
or two and last thing I think you've
already seen this this is from Ikea this
has all my bags my shoes these are from
Muji they're actually really doing that
need to give them a clean but I've got
my lipsticks on categorize and Jean
arrives in here by color so they're all
from Muji silk box is IKEA that's got on
a pink lipsticks in it if you would
believe that and then I just got on
their perfumes and everything here it's
really really organized so that is
everything I've picked up recently for
my new flat I hope you enjoyed this kind
of format is showing you obviously I
can't sit and hold up the fridge so
that's what I wanted to kind of do a bit
of a walking tour while showing you all
the big furniture and big pieces that we
just picked up so really hope you like
everything if there's something out
there that you think I would love that
kind of matches my aesthetic let me know
