cool probably cold this hands a little
bit but it's a little chilly and I said
max it's got a lot of windows and
they're all like double glazed but
they're all there are slight drops
anyway bang the heat on it's half seven
now yeah so obviously Fashion Week is
five days I only did like a talk on
Friday miss Saturday because there
wasn't with any shows I truly loved
so I'll take custody after do so much
for work so I did loads of work
yesterday I saw bits and bobs and then
today I'm kicking it off again so Sunday
and Monday came like my big days and
doing like five shows each day so
something like that and then couple
Tuesday and then it's done I mean I'm
really looking forward to show though
I've got some incredible shows and
you're hindmarsh versus Temperley
Topshop Malone school years so five
brands I absolutely adore so very very
fighting yeah so done my makeup really I
finally washed his hair bun so that's
looking a lot better
and wash my hair last night got a nice
fresh clean hair but I just want to
literally just have it down Center
parted really chilled the nice makeup on
room today go with my template dress
yeah I'm just gonna poke a liqu spike
soon and maybe makes me a coffee
maybe show you this I'm not sure when
you buy of course Spanish oh and this
dress is amazing
with printed
a lot of overtime
very I've been in school
like carrying them it's like a little
triangle though it's really over time
every season I want to give a homophone
all
they only make very limited supply
accessories
and like
very kind of
some in town looks a lot like some time
to wait around time in between each show
and one show at one time a little bit
I don't mind
okay so that was similar to yesterday
ssin a huge fan of elohim yes probably
no I have like ten pairs of issues
I bought the fit and a very comfortable
does it really really feel free to do
that with representation really
beautiful very kind of similar vibes and
how like a certain types of shoe that
they kind of continue to each season in
different colorways sometimes different
fabrics as well there's a lot of the
kind of statements in which issues at
the pad from previous season system or
even more colors more fabric
lots of suede velvet leathers brought
this season and quite a lot more so
quite a lot of pastels we were nice
grays and pinks and whites but there are
so much rainbow chemical is so much more
colorful at that point diseases quite
often sick tonight the Navy's and kind
of rich jewel tones which was still
there which is noticing but just mix a
little bit while the spring vibe okay
next I have been way over to Angela
Martin which is fine era Kings watch I'm
just made now port the new versus
the sideshow as always I'm early I mean
it's better to be early but then I
forgot to shows like back-to-back
like mad rushed on gas count from here
over going to get over to battle in the
hole which is about 30 minute drive from
there to Top Shop which is another 30
minute drive so it's a saying like it's
always either chilled and too many
breaks or extremely rush
templates show absolutely exquisite
always so much color so many like
beautiful pinks and whites my
intertwined fabrics really feminine and
really elegant as always so yeah really
one of my favorite shows today and just
with Amelia I rushed over to see Amelia
and the template show and now I rushed
over to Topshop we have eight minutes
eight really have eight minutes to get
stop shop but never start sometime no II
know it's not some time and this journey
is only about 10 minutes anyway so we
should be all good and then Topshop is
up you want to show as well yeah last
show of the day
and then we go to the Emporio Armani
party tonight so it's good at this big
full day today

Emporio Armani party so I've left my
makeup on but I've taken off I mean
