friend Mikey I've known Mike you for
like eight years and because of how busy
our schedules always are I've actually
we went on holiday together there any
years ago and I've only really seen him
like three or four times since then in
eight years so like we've probably only
seen each other for like an hour per
year well I see him is like a really
good friend it's really funny so we just
have such a good time it's been to dish
I'm over in Kings Cross and some yummy
food and wine and big catch ups and it
was just hilarious so I've had the
nicest afternoon it's not like half 6:00
I just come home I thought I would show
you I wasn't sure how long this was
going to take me to do and also
astrocyte Locker doesn't get done blah
blah blah blah blah this is what I'm
down to this is now my entire lipstick
collection pretty much apart from a few
here and there so I thought I'd quickly
show you
Fidelio here in the top we've got
Purple's up to about here this is like
my purple section more autumnal berries
this sign is all pinks hence why it's
got a bit high because there are so many
types of Pink's I've got baby Pink's
super bright fuchsia Pink's and very
muted Pink's so they are all in here in
flat that's it Gloucester that should
not be there I'll sort that in a second
so that's my pinks and purples second
drawer I've got all of my Reds so these
are all the ones that I decided to keep
out of everything the best in the biz
and I like I was watching everything as
I went and checking eyes then here in
this drawer this is my oranges and
corals so all different corals I love
and then this side is bomb so awesome
mainly deal in here and Lauren's in fact
it is older steel and clarinets
never mind so it's on my palms and the
bottom drawer now this is where it gets
a bit crazy because this is my nude
collection and obviously because I wear
nude all the time I have a hell of a lot
of nudes so here are all of my like lip
pen liquid lip pen style nudes
are all in here these roll amount
favourite ones have got so got bare
minerals I've kept a couple of the Kylie
Jenner once which one's did I keep just
out of interest I've got I've got candy
K and I've got coke okay so I've kept
those two put it arise I got rid of
everything else from kylix I haven't
worn it got some bare minerals which is
my other favorites I've got some objects
it's now I've got my favorite palette
ill breeze which are showgirl and birds
a couple of the hourglass ones which are
amazing the new Lancome which is it's
kind of pinky nude it's more it's kind
of thing I would reach them for more in
a day where I want nudes and I want pink
that's why it's kind of pimple here and
I've kept a couple of our starts here
Beverly Hills I think I've got crush
I've got crush milkshake and also pure
Hollywood milkshake is really good if
you want like an ombre and you want a
really light lip in the middle then I've
got all of my lip liners in here my new
lip liners so that oh then in here these
are all of my nude lipstick something
these are all the ones I decided to keep
so I've got some Tom Ford I've got my
five away from our Marnie of course my
favorites I've got some Smashbox makeup
forever
bite Charlotte Tilbury some myself
L'Oreal from - Tom Ford again I've got
some Fenty's I'll be honest they're not
my favorite color Fenty's but I want to
give them a real go their briefs Gilliam
chiffon she and deal know as well so if
can't categorize everything in this bag
here which such does L'Oreal bag I've
got all of the new Gilliam Rouge G
lipsticks all of these bad boys do me
know where else to put them so they're
commonly on there I need to kind of
categorize them into that colors really
and then in here this is my lip gloss
collection so I'm massively downsized
here and kept everything that I actually
would really want to wear so I've got a
mix of colors it's a lot of nudes I mean
there's a little of news yeah so for
example like my favorite lip gloss
is this one from Gilliam this is number
four seven - it's just the most
beautiful packaged and beautiful lip
gloss when I've got the amazing lip
Stoppers from Shu a which are insane how
to keep them I've got Tom Ford one this
is OH - rose crush and another girl and
this time in the super shiny version
another Burberry there's a couple of
berries in here I've got the bare
minerals glosses as well and I think
I've got one Kylie Jenner in there as
well I think oh and a Chanel that's
super glossy I don't wear glasses very
often so I've just kept the ones that I
think are actually worth it and that is
it I said this is annoying me the fact
this is above so I might go through this
and get rid of one or two more just so
that it's
down because that is really annoying me
feel alive that's it the next thing I
need to do is perfume because this is
just ridiculous
how many they're like nine twelve
probably 45 from here got some Armani

were sent me through the day Sony my
Burberry blush and they've customized it
with the M for me this is absolutely
