you all doing
welcome back to something a little
unusual for my channel I have been
obsessed recently when Nikki Nikki
tutorials and Jackie stars so obsessed I
thinking our channels are so kind of
diverse and unique and this kind of push
the boundaries and they created this
full face of highlighter challenge after
they were inspired by a little youtuber
called Maria who did a full face
highlighter so because of that I really
really want to try it out and just play
around with my own highlighters and see
what I could come up with it just looks
so much fun in literally ever since I
watched the first video of Nikki's and
then saw Jeffrey's I was off there and I
was way I'll ask me can I could think
about was oh my gosh I really want to
film this video I want to go on my
highlight as hours slap them on my face
but I was nowhere near I love my makeup
collection its fastest like I need to
get home and stillness so this is the
first opportunity I've had and I'm so
excited to show you this this is
honestly the most fun video to film so I
really hope you enjoy watching it I'm
just gonna go straight back to their
face and take a little highlight is on
my face P now okay so so exciting I'm
gonna start off with the million dollar
moisturizer just because this is like
extreme glow and that's what we're going
for
there's an added touch of foundation
just to clear up my skin tone and
complexion just a little bit more
perspective so I'm going to use the
Armani maestro glow in number a shake
it's gonna come in with my fern
okay normally as you know I feel like
powder and I've can feel and all that
jazz but for this I just wanna do
something really like obviously a very
shimmery highlighted on the eyes and
some more dark colors so I'm just going
to use the vice palette decay probably a
mix Tristen they've got really amazing
like rosy and like bronzer tones someone
did the eyes first
okay let's start off I'm gonna start off
with less thin it's just gonna go over
the first half of the eyelid I used to
be obsessed with these kind of shades
and this palette and Urban Decay eye
shadows in general they are like some of
the best though aren't they
okay now I'm going to take lucky this
insane like copper bronze
and just reminds for after Koerner one
of my favorite highlights is this one
from hourglass beach it's not the trio
but this is just like heavenly and I've
been using it so much as an eye shadow
tree shade recently but I'm just gonna
use that even more highlight this we
decree a little bit more orange tone I'm
just gonna use some of the lighter shape
I never never know incandescent light
incandescent light going to use that to
blend in the top and also a highlight to
my breath oh okay and for inner corner
of course we've gotta go with Bobby
dazzle it's a nice and white just like
uber pop and I think later on we'll be
adding even more a highlight into here
but for now I'm gonna go with Bobby
dazzle usually what start it and it's
gonna use a bit more of that up here
okay
sweet sweet loving this and again just
to kind of clear at my face so it's just
a bit more kind of affected I'm gonna
use the iconic London palette I use a
bit of banana powder and a bit this sort
of skin shade just to use on the brush
as a bit of a concealer and it's oh good
I'm absolutely obsessed with this right
now
but in a corner now that my face is
right I want these to believe God like
having fun with makeup rather than
taking it seriously is actually so much
fun I'm actually like in my element
right now I'm loving this okay eyes face
pretty much done so it's gonna kind of
play around the few different
highlighters I kind of want a white a
bit of an Al's Copacabana Copacabana
with the Becca shimmering skin perfecter
and you're buying a bit of those
together get it on the face it's just a
tweezerman brush okay this is so much
fun wouldn't the grapes was actually
acceptable to walk around like this
I for one it would definitely try out
this much more oh my godness have you
seen that glow though that's really
gorgeous the next base much like
desperate to try out this is the L'Oreal
True Match highlight in golden glow I'm
not even sure this even out yet but I
got some other day I was just like Hello
like this is just oh goodness
wowzer good not this over-the-top warm
up that whole thing
now if you're like I'm gearing up to be
one of those bronze statues that you see
on the embankment in London hope they
make money doing this god this makes
your skin look so flawless I feel like a
sparkling unicorn
hello oh I really hope this translates
on camera just how it does it definitely
does obsessed I am obsessed and hello
this is brilliant
I want to get a can of a contour bronze
thing on the go so I'm gonna go back
with my fav the bronze is trade from
here it is let you just one of my
favorite favorite things right now let's
go look amazing for this although I'm
definitely gonna run out of this no
don't even care that my hair is light
luminous now you don't even care
oof
I love it a little bit of Goldust from
Tom Ford because this is Buckley and too
much bronze that is just never enough
for me okay I'm gonna go back to my eyes
if I feel like they're not like sparkly
enough I mean they're definitely
highlight II thought the duck the nuts
backing me I'm gonna go back with the
Armani I tent in twelve like a glittery
top coat and these are amazing just
going to take
you can add a little bit of that up here
to fess up so pretty
okay I'm gonna use a little bit more of
the Becca shimmering skin enhancer with
from the anesthesia skylight illuminator
a little bit of those together cute and
that's gonna go under my eyes
and on the chin and in the middle of it
I'm just gonna go in with more of this
okay I'm in love totally enough for this
this is amazing
okay like anything my bra anies a bit
more of a bronze this is so much fun
it's ridiculous I'm gonna use the I'm
gonna use the orgasm highlighter so my
cheeks in here I think this is all too
much for my camera because it just died
as you can see I look completely
different I've done my liner I've done
my brows but you know honestly I was
gonna cut those out anyway so we haven't
missed that much all you have miss so is
my highlight I am just going to do it
again because it was quite frankly my
favorite fit okay starting off
illamasqua really just don't remember
the name of this but I'll leave it down
below right on to these cheeks
it's just insane gold forehead down the
nose Cupid's bow down here why not I'm
gonna cuz I think it would be a total
sin if I didn't include this in this
video
Jaclyn hill champagne pop just to make
it even more rosy tones oh so many
things gonna run that down the nose and
for my cheeks I really wanted to use
this the L'Oreal True Match highlighter
cuz it's gorgeous this isn't quite out
yeah I don't think so out soon and it's
dope you just to make these chickies my
like oh do I need more bronze No
rate I was just literally starting my
mascara when I realized that the camera
had died off so just a quick lump with
Irish curlers I'm just using the Estee
edit gara
but course we're adding lashes this is
just littered with the coat them one in
the black okay lashes just like to like
my favorite brand of lashes but no ever
the talks about them either from
mosquito and these are the lash
Laurette these are amazing I've just
been cutting them and night trying them
I'm going on these bad boys I'm no good
at putting on I like it especially not
with one hand so let's go let's go
these lashes are amazing look at those
just for a little little extra sometime
kind of add a bit more mascara I'm
having a nightmare with this camera

film
I'm loving this video but the camera is
just like yep

had to use it this is the new Christian
Louboutin and if know what your name of
this is but leave it down below but it's
insane yes yes yes yes yes it's will it

center but don't know how it's gonna
look
i'm gonna try and them a little bit on

been looking at myself so long in the
mirror with this but it almost looks
almost natural it's just so glowy and
amazing and i'm just wondering

was all just for fun and i had so much
fun honestly if any of you are thinking

so serious and I just love putting on my
makeup everyday so this was just so fun
