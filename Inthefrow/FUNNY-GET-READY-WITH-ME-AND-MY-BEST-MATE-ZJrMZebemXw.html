my best mate Lucy Liu's and then we all
became like inseparable that's good news
since 2007
so how long's that 11 years yeah Widmer
we thought we'd get ready on camera for
the day could go in shopping what you'll
see in the floor I thought it'd be a
good way to kind of get to know me and
Steph more via our stories god help you
we've got my story I thought it'd be
quite nice to do a bit of her a maple
chat just like a chat to get ready with
your name where we can just delve into
the past not too far into the past
be careful how much you gonna pay me
yeah I am going to start with the map I
love cute so a minute you want I bought
it from this last week yeah but you
didn't even tell me your arm so I do
sorry you were in India oh yeah
did you fly back to see me have you seen
how often do my make up recently proud
of me very lights for in a very light
natural yes I'm really digging it though
yeah my skin is so similar condition
by the way I am not as good at makeup as
Vic so if you watch me doing some things
and you're like why the hell is he doing
that why the hell is she using that
brush or spraying that on there because
I'm just rolling by like I try and watch
vacant all the kind of people out there
who make amazing content or a beauty
book oh thanks babe I'm just gonna serve
yeah you probably look at something like
what is she doing foot
oh let's just roll with it in fact I'm
did y'all what he makeup didn't know he
did that did look really nice you look
beautiful
yeah I'm just you think my I'm so
obsessed with if I told you about this
this skincare line a Lumiere MD who
that's not obsessed this is the SPF 40
if I use retinol my face every night now
die so I'm making sure that every day I
wash that skin yeah you've got to
especially a nice weather
I'm currently easing the Charlotte
Tilbury light wonder youth boosting
perfect skin condition is one of my
favorites
Vita Liberata Beauty blur I knew at the
bottom of this one now I literally I'm
not so obsessed with that remember true
Umbra makeup in uni picture was that I
always remember where I've I've
literally got pink like oh we were
obsessed with pink blusher like most
just a bit a thing when we were at uni
but and I often like well unlike my kind
of like Facebook memories I will send
screenshots to they're gonna be like
look at the state of us have no brows a
lot of a lot of blusher and some really
questionable bright lipsticks like Vic
would always wear like a really pale
pink lip so like man like mass so it's
always really worried about wearing a
red lips you would get and really kind
of like I don't know you you would
always freak out remember we went out to
a club one night and you know we were
just having fun and taking pictures and
she had a red lip on his shoes literally
like I can't wear this I need to take it
off and she just took it off and put
this this like bright baby pink lip fuck
mom is she's like that's more me I
remember was fifth yeah that was a good
tough night
yeah oh my god it was so funny like yeah
they can I had
really kind of like set makeup style so
if it was very much about pink whereas I
was very much about coral had like
orange lips and then like coral cheeks
I remember once walking into a lecture
of my lecture it was like are you okay
and I was like yeah yeah right and he
was like just looked quite flushed
literally like in front of a group of
like ten people timbres their hotel yet
honestly it was like a mortifying all
these people just looked at me it was so
funny cuz obviously we were students we
didn't have a lot of money either so
like when we used to go to places like
Selfridges or Mac it was like a really
big tree it really was wasn't it and we
used to love that yeah it was just like
so much fun we come out with like an eye
liner for ten pounds yeah we would make
it last that we would only wear it on
like certain times a certain night yeah
we would reward and it's when I had my
short hair yeah really super short I bet
if I picture an f-1 I'll be like oh my
god cut your hair short again I loved it
I remember coming home after Christmas
she caught it to him because she started
off with like a long bob do ya editor
and I was like oh god this looks amazing
and I do you think she would look
amazing if she did that kind of like
same thing again because she just was
she looks good with long or short hair
but then she like a couple of months
later just took this ultimate leap which
is such a brave thing to do and
literally shaved and have like a pixie
cut hair which looked incredible what
was just so different
ya know yeah she was literally a pixie
cut yeah it was it was it was like super
short on the sides you know really cute
and kind of like textured on the top I
really really liked it yeah it was a few
different opinions on it but I really
liked it and it was very in at the time
was it not that style definitely it was
like that whole like indie vibe wasn't
it yeah okay look I think you might wear
and keep from the Saturday yeah
Saturday's okay I never see I mean I
think she's still got that hairdo but it
was kind of her thing that sparked yeah
and it was also Arianna when she went
sure asymmetric FOB yeah that's what
everyone was going for yeah
I love that yeah I have what if I use I
use a tiny tiny bit of this l'oreal
infallible in the globe really nice no
it's really like Chloe everybody's just
just just here just for a little extra
coverage.you and I use my nails my
favorite NARS concealer under my eyes
and then I'm just going in with the
benefit hoola light nice I reckon we
should go back to where we used to go
know how we mentioned about they found
earlier I feel like we should go back to
our favorite night help story not the
really bad ones because they should stay
rested I think one of my favorite night
out and guess what you gonna say yeah
and one of my favorite night out is so
obviously when you go back to unity on
this and it's fresh as we drink
ostensibly everyone but the objective is
for for when we were students have a
good time was to have a good time and to
get drunk and have fun and stay out for
as many nights as you could and said I
never happened you know it no he didn't
we put I think the most we have made was
four nights out of a week but she saw a
lot but yeah on one of the nights and we
when we lived in Manchester we would
would have set nights in Monday night's
was Tiger Tiger Tuesday nights would be
Wednesday nights later or Satan's
Wednesday night would be bird cage and
Thursday night would be like a 42 years
or that 42 yeah and then on a Friday
would sometimes be say it was off if
that began so really we didn't really
venture out into lots of different place
yeah we did but like my favorite night
out with Vic was literally we were at
Tiger Tiger and we got into VIP
basically how did you manage I don't
know it's not really VIP you know
student we got into the IP because we
had some contacts and we just basically
got quite drunk but our neighbor who was
in the flat next doors came round the
next day I must let you like Carter you
guys okay yeah we're fine like well
we're all good and he was that you're
like you the three of you two who was me
Vic and then there was our friend Lucy
cuz we all live together he was actually
you flew down the stairs but I think
anyone has ever been to target Agra
and being up to the top floor you'll
know how big those stairs are they're
like 20 staff yeah and he was it sure
like you you've the three of you flew
down the stairs you didn't touch the
steps in between from the top to the
bottom
but that was just specifically me and
Vicki actually turns out that alpha and
Lucy got on the banister and slid down
no she's like she split down and
backwards sure he slid down backwards on
the banister it's the time when we walk
through McDonald's drive-through with no
shoes ha ha she's late walking through
the drive-through another donut with Eli
and numerous pictures we really don't
make this vlog where we are there's
lifts selfies with the McDonald's back
in 100 years a bit disheveled outfits
it's not bigoted and yeah but I mean
people understand like when you go to
unit you're enjoying yourself
you might look pretty much do to make I
mean even when you're not unit you do
all that kind of stuff yeah I think I
think everyone's had that night where
they've got a bit too drew me and come
on like human beings ah man yeah kind of
lightly regretted it but the next day in
the sense of like not drunk on watch
this reminds me actually on mine and
Alex's first date
do you remember no second date second
date am I not the second day and I don't
think I've told her I don't think I've
told these guys about this cuz we went
to miss Euler no dude yeah and and
because I'll say I was nervous enough I
was overcompensating I was drinking
alone so I had a full bottle of Rose a
to myself but I'm stuffing like one or
two beers so who else we got up to leave
it hit me and I was like oh god I'm a
bit bit woozy so then we went to another
bar and by that point I was absolutely
gone and that he was fully mixed it was
probably mixed with the nervousness yeah
I mean it made me wet early and then and
then like there was a point in the night
where where else being really overly
handsy like this in this bar and I
smoked this wine glass across a table
just some guys across the room who were
like what the hell not have to go over
and be like really sorry she said a
little bit too much to drink I got
charged it was just a bottle of wine but
it was I'm done if I'd not eaten enough
that day or what
I was a mess it was you were not in a
great way I mean luckily we're still
together now so it can't have been too
much yes
obviously it's obvious worked for it
worked for it yeah well we had we've had
great moments like our holidays have
been on like ham when we went to Turkey
you you were gonna be like marketplace
and take in everybody kept calling you
Paris Hilton that was hilarious I
thought that was really fun girls
holiday wasn't it and I remember one
night when we dressed up for can you
remember when we dressed up for like her
I think it was roses birthday we dressed
up for like a poop popp gone pop golf we
all just it was pop golf and we started
it off from Fallowfield which is like
another kind of big student area
Manchester and we we made our way down
Oxford Road from fallow field her kind
of like went to that school clubs and
bars around there anyway at the end of
the night we had nobody left like we
were skinned and as we came out this
club again a drunken fellow oh hey up to
me and said can oh my god I love your
visor
can I buy it off you very mind I bought
this visor for like $1.99 from some like
kind of sports shop somewhere and I went
yeah sure thing for like 10 pounds
anyone okay and he gave me a tempo no I
gave him the visor and then we got pizza
on the way home we were so happy
Papa Lido's Oh was it a lot of road yeah
classic classic student area and we got
that and we were so triumphant with that
weren't we doing literally dirty paws
dirty pops we did have like our bigger
group of friends he will have seen in
different blogs that we had I love
probably knows tops oh yeah we ate there
so much just heat up our channel I would
give so much to go back I mean I would
love to do like 24 hours in uni again
even like say like with me a bit like
sodium for examples we would go down
like Castlefield and we'd sit by the
canal watch the birds so it was really
fun wasn't it and then we kept at lunch
and we kind of like be studying and
listen to music and it was just really
nice just a time yeah that's like my
favorite place in Manchester I think
Castle field is like yeah I love beer
yeah
it was just like the trials and
tribulations though that you go through
with you mates yeah like we would go
through breakups let me get back
together then we go through breakups and
then and then you'd also be that friend
that's like oh he was a bastard and then
two two days later yeah I'm back
together with this yeah really or could
you like great just like the on Vick
sideline oh yeah yeah he's horrible all
right on whoever side yeah and then two
days late
hi how do you do I welcome back I
remember once when when Vic broke up
with a boyfriend at uni and we decided
to to try and relieve a bit of
frustration intention to do to do much
we put the mattress up in the hallway
and put a lot of Morissette on really
loud I was singing like at the top of
our lungs and just started hitting this
mattress and it was really yeah it was
it was really a really sort of tension
relief yeah yeah I was I was answering
yeah it was like super angry super upset
and that's what you get when you get
cheat you don't know yeah you needn't
mean use a mattress boxing session and
like what it is best friend I didn't
want to kind of sit there and be a bit
predictable and right let's put the
notebook on like yeah have some wine I
wanted to kind of do something that
would just like try and take her out of
you where you're at right what I'm gonna
do it why and then we had like it like
this it was it you know it'll a big
yacht yeah we will literally just like
screaming it at the top of our lungs
yeah yeah you know I know kind of a
little flat and it's so Airy well you do
with you make up anyway sorry are you
almost almost good I'm on I'm almost
done I'm almost done so I have used the
two-faced um they have natural matte
palette which is really beautiful

lots of makeup I just go with quite a
natural yeah you can get those really
natural natural fires I'm not not big
big makeup on so that's on my eyes and
then I've just stolen some a fix benefit

see that pink this is secret that's
moving around whereas this one is
spunked is it so we used to work
together here and a little shop called
Roxy local surf brand obviously what
Roxy's a massive set of brand but the
shot was quite small and Vic and I will
always do that the Saturday shift
together because obviously were students
and one time where we'd had a really
long day and when we say a long day long
day now is not like a long day compared
to the working world but it would work
like a a 96 shift and it was towards the
end of the day and there was like one
person that one person who comes into
the store like five minutes worried
about clothes and our boss was was sat
with them and they were trying on some
shoes and me and Vic just started
dancing with these mannequins
and it doesn't seem funny but it goes
honest to god the funniest thing like
we've ever ever seen and like our boss
was so hungry
so basically Vic almost like potent stir
this moment she got this money she like
John her body around this this mannequin
and I always behind the tail passionate
and I was like honestly dying then right
opposite me with our boss trying she's
at this person and she just like
literally this woman then conveniently

at the key to it Vicki what are you
doing it so but that just absolutely we
cracked or we might think like and to
