200,000 of you it's just crazy

so much for being here and for sticking
around it means the world to me today
I'm going to be going through everything
that I've been living for the previous
month and this time I do actually have
quite a few things that I'm loving it to
bits so let's get on with it starting
off with a new pair of court shoes from
Sophia Webster I've had these in my mind
to get them for quite a while and I was
in Selfridges with friends and they
convinced me that they were absolute
essentials and I am so glad they did I
more than for Fashion Week and
absolutely love them I got so many
compliments on them because there's such
a statement shoe that's so different I
mean they look like watermelons
obviously so they are very very
different but they seem to go so well
with black trousers neighbor trouser
skirts jeans I mean these are the pair
of cool like mom jeans or wide-leg
boyfriend jeans just look so cute so I'm
in love with them they're quite pricey
they are about 330 pounds but they were
an investment piece and I'm sure get my
wear out of them I love them I'm also
absolutely in love with this new set of
makeup brushes from zoeva I didn't think
I could love a set of make or she's more
than I did with my left so we've a set
of rose gold however look how pretty
these are these are the rose gold and
set there's 12 brushes here all for the
eyes all different types of eye shadow
brush so there's like nothing fatigue
crease brushes which in my favorites
there's tiny little sort of smudger
brushes there are crease brushes
pencil brush tiny little one they're
called a spot liner and they're also on
the packets I haven't used them yet
because I'm yet to photograph some for
my blog in the throat
come if you didn't already know that but
they've been I guess for the past two
weeks and I keep looking at them every
day and thinking how much I want to use
them so I'm just falling more in love
with them every single day
I can't wait to you so they're a big
favor so far next up is a pair of
trousers that I picked up from Reese
actually I don't really learn much from
Reese it's one of those brands I would
love to buy most of my wardrobe from but
obviously it's a little bit more premium
and high price so hopefully over the
years I can build up my investment
wardrobe well I invested in these and
I'm so glad I did I wore these for
limited fashion week I wore them with
these Sophia Webster watermelon shoes
and they look so cute I got so many
compliments on them they're just a
perfect size fit shape little pockets on
the back and ankle greater length so the
perfect length to go with heels and
course shoes because it just sits a
little bit of book around got a little
bit of ankle skin and then you've got
your heel below next up is my favorite
lipstick of the month and it's a
lipstick but I put away for quite a
while and completely forgot I had it's
sunny sale I'm pretty sure that you
should be able to get this I don't think
it was a limited edition but it's a
cream machine lipstick I'm wearing it
now actually kind of like a coral pink
nude and on over nude lips it just has
the cutest sheen and glisten of color
and it's just so pretty so I'm loving
that at the moment especially as a
spring shade next up is a jacket
favorite and again if you see my blog or
Instagram you'll have seen this a few
times it's a lip Seaborg jacket and it's
in a dusty rosy pink with a white
ceiling inside and a aviator style
that's it for the front it's so
beautiful it's the perfect fitting shape
on me I'm a size six and I got this in a
size six and it fits me so snug and so
perfectly it's a really robust faux
leather this can't be real leather
that's what probably cost a lot more
money I also mentioned this in my haul
video and how much you loved it there
and I just am NOT taking us off at the
moment so quite a picture here of me
wearing this jacket with the trousers
and the heels and also my new bag that
shows you how I wore all together
so hopefully that gives you a bit of an
idea of how it fits in shape and things
like that but I absolutely love it and
this is about 90 pounds next up I could
not do this February favorites without
mentioning my brand new handbag it's
exactly what I've been after I've been
after a black bag of the perfect size
with handles and a long strap and the
silver hardware round green leather and
feet now for months and months and
months I was going to maybe buy the
Givenchy I'm to go and regain black
after I bought it in pink but I figured
I wanted to go for something a little
bit different so I saw that Fendi had
brought out this shape and it's exactly
what I wanted it's perfect because it's
green leather it's not kind of scratches
easily and that's what you really really
need from a designer bag it's just
wonderful so I'm super happy yeah it's
very very expensive
it's a massive investment piece but I
liked you to treat myself to a new
handbag every year that's what I want to
spend my credits on and that's what I
want to spend my pencil and I absolutely
love it at one more Beauty item as well
I thought I'd mention so I don't think
you've really mentioned this before and
it's the LMS Pro radiance cream cleanser
it's really bright makeup when you see
it I put this away in my drawer for
quite a while and the other day well a
few weeks ago I thought you know I'm
gonna give this a go see what it's all
about
the whole idea is like you just pump
love it the cream on she comes rub it
onto your dry makeup to face and it
really starts to kind of break down all
the makeup and wash it all off and then
you use a little a little loofah under
the hot water tap hot I usually do it as
hot as I could possibly get it so I feel
like I really helps to break down
everything on your face and then just
exfoliate it and buff it away and you're
left with a super soft face everything's
gone
it's super clean these two I'm very much
a living and would highly recommend
actually next up while most for clothing
in this favorites video has been quite
premium and almost sophisticated style
this I have to mention because it is my
everyday chill out piece it's a
one-piece
see when I'm in the house both me and
Alex have one and we just sit in them to
watch TV in the morning I let's get into
it and to start writing blog posts and
it's chilling it they're so comfortable
I just yeah it's so so nice it's so soft
so cozy and it's a beautiful sort of
fleece lining and there's such good
quality like the best quality for me
one-piece onesies were kind of the first
people to really do the whole onesie
things so I'm glad that me nights are
fine they kind of got some and we can
kind of buy into the whole thing because
I actually really really love it
something I had to mention is my brand
new camera plus seeing a lot of these
everywhere so die and I finally had to
get my hands on one
it's the olympus pen just the EPL 7 in
the white with a pretty sort of cream
leather effect to the front it's just a
stunning camera it's so retro and
old-school
it comes with a little flash in the box
as well definitely gonna become my new
vlogging camera my other vlogging camera
I absolutely loved the Panasonic Lumix
however it has no empty shake so a lot
of you were always sort of like why are
you shaking the camera so much and it
actually I literally was just holding it
but it's picking up every single
movement ever but this has ant shakes so
that won't happen anymore so I'll be
able to start vlogging things and I have
a very very exciting trip coming up at
the end of March I'm not sure having you
tell you about it yet maybe not what I'm
really really excited about it so I'm
taking this away with me to take
pictures and also to block with so yeah
highly recommends camera is beautiful
not if everything that I love off the
break so hopefully you enjoyed it if you
did please do give me like and subscribe
if you're new and in that case I'll see
you in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
