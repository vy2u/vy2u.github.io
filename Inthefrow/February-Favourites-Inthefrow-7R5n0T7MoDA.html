favorites video for the month of
February with it being Fashion Week this
month there's a lot of clothing that
I've really really loved someone taught
you through some my favorite pieces and
also there's a few new piece of makeup
in my collection that I also wanted to
show you and talk through and tell you
why I really really love them so yeah
let's just get straight into it I'm
gonna kick things off with beauty and
the first thing being the zoeva nude
spectrum palette that we've ever brought
out a few new palettes recently and this
is definitely one I really really love
the most
think I use this in a recent tutorial on
my blog if you want to go and have a
look at more pictures of how I used it
but this is a 15-pound palette in lots
of beautiful nudes as you know I really
like my nude colors and my champagnes
and my kind of Goldy provinces and this
sort of has everything I could possibly
need right inside here so it has two
champagnes it's got the white set
perfect soft in a corner highlight it's
got black if you want to sort of smoke
it all up a little bit but it also has
some more copper tone red tones as well
in there and also a really bright gold
so I feel like it's really great for a
lot of different skin tones you can
create lots of different looks with this
and I was really really impressed the
pigmentation is fantastic the
wearability and the way that they blend
on the eyes it's really beautiful so
yeah definitely a big favorite this
month I think it's one of those that
I'll throw in my travel bag quite often
and take this away and hold it with me
excel now I've got lots of different
colors in here so yeah I'm really really
impressed by this next up as you know I
like to tap quite often at the moment
I'm not too turned I'm going to be
filming a tanning routine very soon it's
not just so keep your eye open for that
but I thought I'd mentioned two towns
that I really really love and I've been
using a lot recently and those being the
Vita Liberata looks shoot an especially
a lot of the Vita Liberata products that
you really like and this one it's
probably one of my faves phenomenal
lightest air 2 to 3-week tan mousse and
it does last quite while this I would
say maybe not quite two to three weeks
but definitely lasts maybe seven days
especially if you moisturize and you
cover your body a lot
it'll death
stay there a little bit longer but I do
really really love this one I think the
call is fantastic and I'll just use MIT
to apply it and again the same with the
cocoa brown this is a new bottle but I
have quite a few of these bottles
roaming around in my bathroom I've used
product for a long long time actually I
think since my university days and it's
just one of those extremely affordable
but brilliant products like it really
gets a job done
it applies streak-free it's really
really brilliant so again I thought I've
mentioned those too if you're wondering
what kind of tons I use often these two
are highly recommended figured I'll
throw this in here because it's a little
bit random but then again we all use
this and it's just a children I'm really
enjoying the Mitchum 48-hour powder
fresh G autre it's not too girly or
over-the-top intense its fragrance this
is quite fresh feel kind of very well
protected wearing this it's a sporty
eight hour
I mean I would place still top it up
anyway so I think most of us used to do
but I just yeah we're really enjoying
using this a lot actually and if you
don't like sprays and it just also come
in the rolling log form as well but yeah
really liking this at the moment there's
the makeup I really wanted to recommend
first or go with this first up eating
clean L'Oreal infallible foundation I've
got mine in the shade natural rose and
natural rose is a shade color name I
would never use the go for because I
sick away far away from the kind of rosy
shades when it comes to foundations I
really like the more yellow tones I like
to kind of banish any pinkness or you
know rosy tone ones within the face so
when I saw that name I kind of didn't
really look at it and it was only when I
went down all the shades was kind of
swatching them so i swatched this and
for actually nothing else is quite right
from here let's see what this is like it
was so perfect I would associate this
very much with the color off now Stovall
which I always say so if you're ever
wondering what kind of normal skin color
I am if I've not tanned heavily it's
just now Stovall usually and this is
very very similar to that
I was so blown away by this I think I
saw Suzy hello October talked about this
not sure she talked about the matte
version because there isn't
version this is the stay fresh this is a
bit more chewy and brightening but I'm
not one format so I went for this one
and really adore it the coverage is
beautiful it's quite medium coverage
definitely buildable but still quite
lightweight you don't feel like you're
really caked and makeup and again the
color is really brilliant for me so I
was so impressed with this I think it's
about 11 power but also much more
affordable I'm not sure if I mention
this before and I'm really sorry if I
have but I just wanted to mention it
again because I really am smitten with
it and it's one of the Tom Ford cream
eyeshadows and this is the one in spice
and this is just so beautiful if you
really love your cream eyeshadows and
you're after something that's very long
wearing very bright and very pigmented
and the kind of shade that people would
go at wow what are you wearing on your
eyes this is the one for you think how
well it's on my eyes in my in my Chanel
and Dior unboxing video and so many of
you were saying oh my gosh I love your
eyeshadow and it was this it's a Tom
Ford spice cream eyeshadow it really is
beautiful it just blends it is literally
like a mousse actually and it blends in
beautiful bit it's extremely pigmented
but you can blend it over the eye with
so much ease I like to dip into this
with a brush and just start working it
in position more of the color in the
very central lid and I'll start working
it in and working it in with a brush and
moving the color further out further out
to get a really smoky crease and a much
more intense eyelid and it's so
beautiful I honestly can't recommend
this enough I know it's very expensive
for a cream eyeshadow as Tom Ford
products are but you will literally have
this pot for so long and it's kind of
one of those now but again when I'm
stopped going away I always test how
much I love products for how much I take
them away with me so do go on quite a
lot of travels so if I immediately throw
this into my holiday bag I know it's a
good product and this is one that just
but like yet that's going with me
definitely so yeah love it a lot okay
and before I go and wash my hand it
slips it everywhere now I thought I
mentioned too last fuchsia products and
they're both lipsticks the first one
being for more affordable option and
this
Yanis by l'oréal and it's one of their
cool exclusives this one being the Naomi
Naomi's delicate rose and again and
really loving this color again I use it
in a recent blog post kind of drugstore
tutorial look it's very me it's a very
new deep pink with tones of coral I'd
say so it's almost like a peachy but
definitely my own sort of nude pink side
the consistency is really easy it stops
glides on the skin really beautifully it
has almost a sheen to it as well which
again is the kind of formulation of
lipsticks that I really prefer nothing
too sparkly or glittery but with a sheen
and a bit of a pop of color and not a
glossy but a sort of sheer wash of color
that's what I really love and this is
really really beautiful for that again
it's really affordable thinks it's like
seven pounds of lipstick I've had this
in my makeup person side my handbag
which again shows me I really love it
and I take it with me
and the final lipstick option is by
Yvonne she and it's one of their new
Rouge in 2d vinyl the rose mutant shade
and the thing I love about these is that
as I've seen before about the L'Oreal
lipstick I really love lipsticks offer
this kind of wash and sheer brightening
color the lips just look bright and
really hydrated and very moisturized
this is just very moisturizing I guess
very hydrating on the lips and this is a
color I really really door again it's a
kind of new to paint shade not as coral
Allyson io meet L'Oreal but very very me
and I just love the consistency the
consistence is beautiful the texture the
way it feels in my lips I can wear that
spot ages it doesn't dry out my lips it
just feels very beautiful and hydrated
and again it's just one of those super
easy bombs get out your back throat on
your lips without a mirror and you kind
of got to go moving into it fashion the
first thing I want to mention it was
this cute little bodysuit I am kind of
loving bodies a lot and that a bit sick
of it but I just really liked them on my
figure I feel like white fluttering I
feel quite secure in there over the fact
that body can be tucked into jeans or
leather trousers alright
like that and not have any creases or
things right not this is quite slick and
flattering so this is another one I
picked up from River Island
this one is short-sleeved though I don't
have any other set of short sleeves and
it's just you know just super easy to
wear I kind of just took it to a nice
pair of jeans very simple top but I
really like it and I like the fact that
it's so I've got this texture going
across there but I finished it like I
said because it has been Fashion Week a
lot of the pieces I'm about to show you
I wore for Fashion Week and these are
sort of some of my favorites I thought
I've mentioned them to you first one
being this from Rhys this blazer is just
so gorgeous I was really drawn twix it
looked very soft BAM man with this
double-breasted fastening in the Navy
with the beautiful lapels it just called
out to make sure it when I saw it I
thought it's very Batman but obviously
at a fraction of the price of bomber
this is Rhys this is still about 250
pounds to buy but I think it's one of
those pieces that you would wear time
and time again for thoroughly different
occasions for very structured shoulders
for a more of a formal effect to a very
casual outfit but just in a very cool
style so yeah I absolutely adore this I
had to talk to you about it next type of
jacket is this one and again I've spoken
so much about the Mars jacket that I
have the black jacket and this is sort
of become the other one that I wear when
I don't wear that one this one in stones
more of a charcoal gray and I like the
fact that inside the collar it's a bit
of a lighter gray because I often pop my
collar don't know why I just didn't felt
many many years of sweet line fuck the
ants it accentuates your neck so this
coat very similar length to the one that
have emerged this one has two buttons on
it pockets and it's a really wonderful
fabric I'm sure it must be a wool type
of wool and this is actually from Joseph
from very exclusive and they're going
for Fashion Week it could be a casual
and it could be more dressy depending on
what you wear it with the next piece is
from Topshop and it's a pair of cropped
trousers
and they are this gray and white stripe
this is a kind of trial - I was looking
for when I went into these as I wanted
something that was quite so a little bit
more room a something it's almost
between a collage and a cropped trouser
and I think these were the perfect
choice for that they hang really
beautifully off the body and wonderful
with a person letõs at the way I wore
them to Swit some easy black stilettos
again you could tuck a body suit into
this and again to sort of keep
everything very slender and neat tucked
into these because it's all about the
sort of statement trails there and
there's a really lovely fabric great
fabric affordable trouser I really felt
lovely wearing these as well and the
very last piece I wanted to mention
because I wore this and so many of you
commented on the instagrams or snaps
about this dress about how much you
loved it and I equally adore this and
it's from three-floor I've won a few
pieces of bears before and I really love
how unique and stylish and bright and a
bit daring this brand is they always
have designs and colors that a little
bit more out there and more exciting and
the designs are always it always quite
unusual I kind of feel like this brand
and self-portrait at the moment I do
some really amazing things I Wallis to a
L'Oreal party over Fashion Week and this
goes down and shoot some mini dress with
a navy bottom wrap over skirt that goes
up into this body which is lace and it's
also mesh so I do end this with a bra
and I felt really really Guzman at
wearing a bra cause he completely
covered with these big lacy powers in
navy and it's gorgeous aqua turquoise
she's gonna put my favorite colors so I
got that and the Navy trimmed down the
center and also down the back it's just
really beautiful I mean you've got
you've got cutouts you've got mesh
you've got beautiful satin piping you've
got lace as you kind of feel like what
is not to love about this dress it's
very out there and not everyone will
want to wear these council colors and I
have never really worn these kind of
colors either before and a daughter
absolute doughnut so I thought I'd
mention it for anyone that saw it
Instagram and didn't know where I'd got
it from
I think that's it for today's video just
a few makeup products and a few fashion
products I've really loved I thought you
guys might be really interested in too
so really hope you did enjoy it if you
did then feel free to give me like right
now it's a little like button always
makes me super happy to see you enjoying
