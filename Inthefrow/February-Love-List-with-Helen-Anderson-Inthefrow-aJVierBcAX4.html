list and today I am joined for my very
good friend Helen hello you might know
her as Helen Anders on YouTube of course
I'll leave her link down below so go
have a peek you will love videos I love
your video so I'm sure you guys know
so I've roped in Helen to do one of my
loveless videos because I'm really
enjoying doing more collaborative their
form of to everything is fun when
there's more of us both legs so it's a
nice way to get to know much more about
Helen as well and both of us for what we
liked for Harry you should we get right
let's do it
first question is or the first love is
what I watched favorite film slash
program okay I watched a movie I do that
movie picking at the moment at home
because I'm on a roll so Matthews like
you pick the films and the best film I
think I've watched was one good chef you
are so good there's a bit where he is
making the cheese toastie like it made
all my nerve endings tingle like it's
basically about a guy that's a really
good chef things go wrong on Twitter
like he anyway so he decides to open a
food truck and Travel America making
salmon desert just looks like it's so
good it's like the the ideal life it's a
really laid-back film oh yeah a super
easy watch and I really like the
scripting in it I think a lot of it's
quite eloquent and very it's very
contemporary so it's very up-to-date but
it's not corny like they talk about
social media and sometimes movies do it
you're like yeah yeah we're still not
ready if they make that I know you mean
that cringey maybe I don't quite get it
nope yeah are you your favorite Oh tell
you what I didn't like something called
the lobster have you heard about it no
it's the most fun I've ever seen Oh in
fact things I do enjoy watching right
now Oh have you seen this Chelsea does
program on Netflix no it's about this
one called Chelsea I don't know if she
is really hmm but I think she's like a
talk show host or I can
from Americans okay and it came up ping
like the new way in June mm-hmm and it's
called Chelsea doors and she talks about
drugs racism and a few of the topic
there's like four different actors but I
really like and she's really funny and
it's a really nice kind documentaries
like yeah I very much recommend that to
anyone that hasn't seen it go check that
out
second question favorite photo of
February okay
this is my favorite photo so it's a
photo of eight do your cruise collection
bag and pet after your shoes but the
reason I really like it it's because it
was the first time I got to it with deal
mm-hmm and they took me to Paris and I
went to one of their new launch parties
and it was just like clothes of like
cool people there and it was just
amazing experience yeah it was just
really nice to work with such a huge
brand that's really nice so this kind of
reminds me just how kind of cool in a
fashion it was like a massive experience
yeah okay I think my one is going to
have to be oh no I really like this one
that my mum took of me which is me
outside the Eiffel Tower because me and
my mum went on holiday to Paris for like
four days and it was just such a nice
time to spend with my mum like being a
grown-up you like you'll see your mom
like for a cup of tea or like pop over
and whatever but having some like 101
quality time it's just so nice I mean
such a good time but you've never been
to Paris so everything was amazing to
her and she was all like getting all
like oh my gosh everything is so nice
okay who you loved so you aren't your
favorite it could be any person it could
be someone you don't know it could be
someone you do know it could be family
member I'm gonna have to say my mom just
because we went away and I got to see
her really happy you know it's just low
noise and it was just yeah she's my
favorite because we'd spent some good
times together I would say this month it
would be my best friend's death mm-hm
because she came down last week when we
had like a London weekend together and
we stayed I managed to kind of get us
into a hotel tonight and we have like
dinner and they went shopping and it was
just so nice so you're so good to see
her yeah and she's always there flying
and
making sure that I'm kind of
everything's kind of organized in my
mind as she talks me through things and
she's just yes and I love her she's the
best favorite things you wore all right
okay this is like shoes us shoes right
okay so I got these when I was away and
I've never really splashed out on
clothing before in terms of like
designer and these are Zadie good
voltaire oh and I know I've always
really loved that design it because it's
kind of edgy and there's lots of skulls
on things and it's very kind of I do I
like it a lot so about the funny pair of
boots which are like western boots I
love and they've got like the bit on the
back but these were like it was like
heaven has opened its gates to me
because these were actually Half Price
so when I went and I looked at the
thingy on the tag and I said okay cool
whatever took them to the till and she
was like oh this price is fine so in the
half it's labelled purses I believe I'll
leave a link down below ok have a look
oh my god this is my favorite piece of
Feb so if you read my blog and assume
Instagram you might have seen this
already and it's a feel the fabric that
I'm a good that's gonna meet I bought it
really the fabric so it's a matte silk
it's incredible
and it goes all the way down into kind
of a long dress why wear it it's like a
big dress and it's also got oh yeah it's
also got a belt so you can tie it in
with a belt I'll put a picture on the
screen so you can kind of see what looks
like on love but it was most of the
fabric is so nice anything is hmm I
don't know how to wash it and I've
obviously got like makeup on it and look
at that and like how do you from watch
me does it not say they don't have tags
in my dry clean yeah
so yes oh jeez eyelets and Joseph like
hi uncle heel boots you almost look like
straps yeah yeah yeah and a bit more
texture to the bottom and then like a
nice bright pastel bag
hewwo most part even the a black bag
would look really nice favorite thing
that you did so how you spending your
free time so it's quickly anything you
did I went to Disneyland Paris on my
birthday and I wanted to cry it was
amazing like I I've only just been to
Orlando if I can build a house on the
Main Street I'd quite happily live there
I know it says it is the ultimate let's
forget about all our worries all at
what's all of our stresses because you
just didn't the land of dreams I know I
think everything is manufactured there
to please you yeah so that is probably
why yeah I went to it was like a
Clarence event it'll soon see my frog
went to the monotron hotel and there's
kind of loads of people there like that
I knew like Suzy and M yeah tomorrow
just so nice to see everyone we went for
like a meal and all sat around and was
caught up for like so many hours
chatting about so yeah it was just
really really nice and that's really
really enjoyed that blink that vlog by
the way down below just in case you're
not seen you'd like to see it okay maybe
things that you ain't
I'm really sorry like cuz obviously like
cuz Paris happened yeah like it's
totally taking over the theme but I had
an eclair from this place oh Jesus
Christ I'm Jelena trying to know I
googled like a clears of pose
Leclaire du génie and it was basically
like different types of eclairs think I
had something with like a cheesy stuff
and mom had almonds or I actually don't
even know it's almost like going to like
a doughnut bar and having all the
different doughnuts but they were
eclairs and they were insane my mom was
like I'm not going to bother buying
Tesco eclairs anymore she's like
rounding I'm going to just buy expensive
cakes like at night
well it was quite like far away from
where we were like we were literally
like traveled to Li Eclair there we
found a bench and ate it and then we're
like that's when I saw my best mates
death mm-hmm and we stayed at Dukes
hotel and we went to their restaurant
that's called 36 my gosh it was good
food it was so again it's all in the
flock he can see it all there all
unfolding but it was the most incredible
food we had like in their moves bouche
which was like a little like like
pumpkins elite we had we had like goats
cheese starter and I had like a goat's
cheese and beetroot risotto
oh my gosh Ben then afterwards we had
three cheese it's not good oh yeah
cheese plate and the cheese was like a
list well GU it was but highly recommend
next one is what's the favorite thing
you drunk
well it was my birthday this month so I
was drinking a lot of margaritas on my
night yeah I just love margaritas that I
had I have like you know when you go to
a restaurant which do like burgers and
stuff we went I took my whole family and
friends there and we just had that so I
have like a really big pink margarita
and it was really really nice then after
we went for drinks and then it was and
they'd make a bit more like their their
cocktails are more traditional so I had
like it was like half the size as the
previous one but generally like
cocktails originally all mixing alcohol
and not necessarily the mixer yeah so I
felt like doing it was really nice it's
definitely gonna be hands down I went to
Angelina have you been - Angelina
rebound no oh I've heard about it before
mmm and people have told me to go and
finally our hotel will such a next door
to it I went there the hot chocolate is
insane it's what you like melted mole
- chocolate I'd said see these things
and I was like oh but I was already
pushing the but like the limits yeah
everything else so let me give you about
this much it's boiling hot but it's so
delicious it's like the best girl I know
and I'm a connoisseur of the hot
chocolate favorite event or occasion
like I had my birthday and then a few
days later we went out for food and
drinks with my family all my family and
friends and I just had such a nice time
because normally like you do you found
anything and they do stuff of your mates
boats just what you know what I'm just
gonna pick a really big table and it was
really nice because I've got like
younger nieces so my friends were like
interacting with him and playing with
them and then it was just a really nice
night and I and I got like all my mates
brought me my presents and my friends
always buy me stupid stuff but it's
always really good like and I love it
and I got home and I literally wanted to
cry because I was so overwhelmed and
happy with how the night when and how
and everyone had just like put so much
thought into what they got me and
everything even if it was stupid it was
very much me and I was like okay for my
favourite is enter occasion it's got to
really be again when I went to Paris and
your pitch pictures looked yeah it was
amazing so like with the picture
shooting that do you all want so it was
the Dior event and the whole - your kind
of shebang and the day after I met with
Armani and went to like backstage at the
Armani and I also got to meet like the
head makeup designer for Armani and they
also went to the Couture show for Victor
and Ralph
so that few days looks like Dior Armani
victim Ralph like your style was just so
amazing
it sounds pretty amazing inch me moment
yeah I've always loved like design of
fashion so to be able to go to a Couture
show and go backstage and meet all these
kind of amazing people are so creative
it was just like yeah it's a bit of a
pinch room I felt very proud I got my
share I'm doing this yeah to get this
yeah yeah I worked very very hard to
kind of get to your points yeah felt
very very proud so yeah ok next one what
you heard
some of the month okay my favorite song
of the month well I'm very very dubious
about covers
however hey MA hi more himhe they had
did a cover of because I'm a man by tame
impala now tame that that that album
from tame impala well I put on vinyl and
it literally it's been on all of
December January but then I discovered
that they at home it did a cover very
much similar to the original but it's
beautiful because of like the female
vocals on it and I've been listening to
it like over and over again like yeah it
is really really good really it is on
Spotify so put the link to it if we can
but it's a really really good song sorry
chill but I feel like they haven't
strayed too far from the original which
I feel is almost like a tribute to it so
yeah I said this to kind of two faves so
this one being the new Panic at the
Disco album okay have you listened to it
good album cuz I used to I was obsessed
back in the day with the first sounded
so obsessed I was on that so when they
came out I was like I think I'm pretty
sure the second album I didn't listen to
it but there was a witness came out I
was quite excited about it
and really been on that so that's really
good and then I've got a mention
pillow-talk would you like it by saying
I haven't listened to that yeah Ibiza
I know and I did actually try and look
it up online like my inner circle I
think ebbets when I was looking for I
didn't have a good internet connection
I just forgot about oh it's so catchy
it's ridiculous I like to put almost a
lot of things new song played and all
right especially with me go in the gym
so much yeah it's been like my proper
workout track I'm gonna fit well I know
we'll do whatever party after day it
would just play our two song sexy and
really like it's no it's really catchy
uplifting in a way but yeah it's a good
one
good so favorite things that you you
used okay my favorite thing I've used
are my headphones they are wireless
bluetooth headphones by parent and I got
really nice like copper of light side
them but they're like touch sensitive so
you can control your music by doing
things on here seriously yeah do a try
it yeah and and they have they literally
block out sound so when you turn them on
it sounds like you're going dead think I
turn that one but okay you can you pause
it but just touching it yeah and then
you can play again and then volume is
done goes the slogan is incredible
volume slide up and down is it domeki
and then you can skip a song where just
no way yeah yeah so like when you're at
the gym when you're at the gym when
you're like on the treadmill you're like
I'm bored of this oh and then also they
do stop playing when you take them off
but they pause so if we bump into
someone in the street you just have to
talk to them
you can just get out that and I'll stop
playing about having music blasting love
those yeah that just really isn't really
nice yeah okay
okay well my my thing I use is a little
bit more boring than hell is no I won't
mention it again
because I have missions a few times but
recently this has been my Savior
especially with my hair being so kind of
gray blonde after a few days after maybe
a week it just start to go more yeah I
don't know what yellowy green tone I
know you mean because mine mine although
it's sort of it's very like gray yours
yeah with my you just start to go to
spit off and this just pulls it back to
life like so many people say you only
much use it like once every two weeks or
not that often but I mean I only wash my
hair every four or five days so what I
do I shampoo my hair and then I
literally like coat my hair in this my
coat it will be in a bit but you like it
so it's like purple my hair earlier like
five minutes while I'm not watching the
rest of me then I wash it off and
literally it makes such a difference
when my hair's got so much market is
really really nice it's so much brighter
words when I first put it on it was so
much more like mmm yellow blonde golden
blonde yeah so this is so good this is a
L'Oreal professional
but silver gloves protect system and I
have mentioned a lot of times for well
yeah honestly it's so good I'm still
using it a lot oh you've got my own
insight into Helen as well as well as me

like the questions yeah they're very
much about you and less about new things
