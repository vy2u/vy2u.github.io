time gone do you lie just seems like a
bit of a blur now I feel an June's went
by so fast with me being away it feels
like summers kind of come and gone but
there's still August left a little bit
of September which is very very exciting
by the way coke it will sent me some
bottles to try and they are so nice like
I'm not really chocolate milk drinker
but I'm definitely converted now there
so you're so of course a little Sleeping
Beauty straw it's why not anyway
Coco are going to be out festival this
year which got me thinking that I
haven't done a festival lookbook yet
this year I seen a few them floating
around for some reason it just didn't
occur to me that I should film the
festival season video so that's what
this is going to be I've put a few of my
favorite types of products together so
if I was going to a festival this year
these are the types of outfits I would
be wearing so hopeful it might inspire
you a little bit as well outfit number
one this is a really lightweight cute
outfit there's a little pair of shorts
and a crop they're both from misguided
and I've just paired them a little pair
of converse with a studded effect you
might not want to wear white shoes if
you know you go into really muddy
festival but otherwise I thought they
were really cute with the outfit I've
thrown a kimono of the top those times
when the sun is shining and it starts to
burn your shoulders it's a little
lightweight top will make sure that you
don't get really burned and then for the
times when it's raining you need a
little bit more protection throw on a
really cool rain Mac like this one from
reins and I'll keep you entirely dry
entire day
outfit - I love the different elements
this outfit I wanted something that
would be quite cool you're also really
fashionable and quite chic and edgy so I
went for these denim shorts I picked up
in San Francisco and they have a really
cute little lace trim around the edges
just for that extra little bit of
detailing as layer
I also added this cute little bomber
from misguided I just love the print of
this that little pop of color it was a
top of him or monochrome outfit and it's
just a lovely shape and fit then I added
some hunter Ellie's because it can't go
wrong with wellies for a festival or
keep you super safe and dry all day
and finally this lingerie bodysuit from
reckless wolf which is stunning and just
gives a really edgy effect to this
outfit
outfit number three I really like the
way this outfit transitions from quite
cute to quite grungy due to the
accessories that I've paired this with
so I've got the place suit from home I
love London and I've matched it with
some more grungy edgy boots from cats
these types of boots are really making a
comeback this season and the perfect for
festival styling and then I've put this
reins back with it it's a really cool
design this design is only out in
January though but it's gorgeous sort of
snakeskin style and it's completely
waterproof so it'll keep all of your
festival goodies nice and safe
then if it gets chilly air or maybe the
Sun comes out you need to protect your
shoulders to throw in a really
lightweight denim shirt helping them
before this is definitely more of a day
pass kind of outfit the kind of outfit
you'd go to a festival in if you just
had one day and wait to make more of an
impression so I've put this really
gorgeous statement kimono with it just
still have a nice black simple dress so
that you all you see really it's a
kimono and the colours and the style
I've paired it with a really simple tote
bag from pink oh and just because it'll
be nice to wear some heels sometimes
I've put these Fenchurch boots with it
just a very small heel or the small
wedge so they'll be super easy to walk
in but they look really cool and chic
with the outfit
and finally outfit number five I am
loving the layers with this outfit there
are so many different layers so it
starts with this range jacket this color
is beautiful I love it with my hair a
beautiful vibrant yellow nice pop of
color and like I said before this is a
range jacket and they are so brilliant
at being completely waterproof they'll
keep you total dry if you have a massive
festival downpour then beneath that we
have this really cool Motel mesh top
it's almost like a kimono shirt style
top quite long perfect row of bikinis
and body suits but here I've just tucked
it in to a really cool pair of Levi's
denim shorts
I'm also styling this with my graph yet
rucksack because I just love that pop of
lilac and the final layer is this
swimsuit from motel which I'm just
wearing here as a bodysuit really nice
effect down the side it has a lattice
now cut out nice little detailing but
this is perfect for if the Sun comes out
it gets really warm he's going to take
off some layers and have something
really lightweight and cool beneath then
finally some jelly shoes let's get your
feet nice and cool but also strapped to
you feet so those are my top five
festival fashion ideas I hope you like
them so I thought I'd also go through a
few things that maybe you don't want to
wear at festival we all know that people
have committed some pretty bad festival
folk paths and I thought I'd go through
a few I've seen a me warn you off a few
things you might not want to do at
festival
first thing is Footwear like I was
showing before with my festival ideas I
wore polka jelly shoes now I have to see
a lot of people at festivals wearing
flip-flops worst thing ever
yes you might keep your feet really
really cool and they look quite cool and
the super lightweight easy to packing it
bag but if you are stood in the middle
of a pit watching your favorite band
play and if one starts jumping and
moving around are you trying to get out
of the pit and you trying to move across
people in the crowd flip-flops go
everywhere I know this from personal
experience I myself wore a bow
flip-flops into the pier a gig and yeah
my boyfriend at a time which I had to
pick me up and hold me when everyone
started jumping on the chorus because I
was just losing my flip-flops and
there's glass everywhere
yeah I'm just it wasn't good so that's
why I wore those jazz shoes still with a
lightweight still really cool and easy
to pack bought that strapped your feet
so I'm not gonna come up the next thing
I'd say would probably be of more about
kind of health and safety really again I
kind of showed you in all those Clips
ways to wear things with your outfits
that means that you'll keep yourself
safe he might times I've been to
festivals and
walking around like Red Lobster's
because I'm not taking any Sun cream
you're not taking anything to cover up
the Richard Donner bikini or a pair of
shorts I've not thought about the fact
that it might be sunny and I've gotten
completely red raw and it's really
upsetting to seeing it oh god take a hat
take a quick little throw over like a
kimono that you can wrap around your
waist a denim shirt you know throw on at
least your bit covered if you've not got
any Sun cream so just kind of be careful
if you are going to a vessel for the
first time and make sure that you're
pretty prepared and then there are those
people that we're really high heels
festival yes I know I showed you a pair
of high-heeled boot wedges but that but
hi they're like two and a half inches
and let's go wedge so the super easy to
walk it but those people at West select
OHS and really silly shoes they might
only be there for the day but does he
not realize that they're going through
walking down grass first of all I meant
a place where you can experiment and you
can wear lots of different things so
yeah experiment with your clothes and
experiment with what you want to wear
what you will layer together that's cool
like that's awesome but make sure as
well that you are like looking decent I
mean yeah Keeney top pair of shorts cool
awesome
maybe not far bikini you're not in Spain
you know I'm in the middle of England
festival surrounded by hundred thousand
people maybe bikinis not quite the way
to go
so taste it
similarly in the way that you want to
take things to keep you Shady from the
Sun and can you protect from the Sun
make sure you do also take something
that protects you from the rain
people usually walk around festivals
like Tehran rats because they haven't
taken anything and they're just thinking
so you are at you're at a festival it's
just nothing but a good time you know
some people just don't care not fine but
if you just want to stay looking me best
throughout three days with that just
take a rain map or some things that you
can wear like a poncho put your poncho
on keep your hair from looking a
complete mess now hopefully you're
inspired and you're quite fancy and
going to a festival this year and now I
am so inside these little you'll need
pots of joy you've got nothing but sugar
chocolate and milk so that's why cookie
I've come up with their campaign
hashtag nothing but if they are going to
be at Festival this year as I said and
because of that they are giving away for
you to get the best of all when you
follow Cokie on Twitter you just need to
tweet them at a kokyo UK with the
hashtag nothing but and you could be the
chance of winning yourself some vessel
tickets this year so why not yeah
hopefully you've enjoyed this a little
bit more chatty and a bit different from
my usual style as always thank you so
much for watching and sticking around
and I'll see you again soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
