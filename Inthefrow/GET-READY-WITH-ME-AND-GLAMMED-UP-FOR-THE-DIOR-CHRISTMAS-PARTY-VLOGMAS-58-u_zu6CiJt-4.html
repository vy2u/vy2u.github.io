there is a Dior dinner later
do your Beauty dinner there's never
really been a deal Beauty dinner before
so this is gonna be really lovely loads
of girls I know are going yeah I just
need to get myself an outfit so this
order of the day is I'm going to nip
like this I don't know put any makeup on
before tonight's event so I'm gonna nip
to Dior the Dior show room to pick up an
outfit to wear for tonight and then
after that I'm going for a little
meeting with Instagram a little chat and
a catch up so that's kind of it and
they're gonna come home do a bit more
work and then start preparing for later
so I'll be sure to show you I'm putting
on my face because I'm sure that you
probably want to kind of know the
general gist of what I'm putting on my
face that's I'm quite excited ok I
couldn't resist put on a little bit of
concealer brushing my eyebrows putting
on some moisturizer and put on some
lipstick but now I'm going out okay so
it's been ages since I did
sorry about my shirt makes it odd
annoying noise so yeah it's gonna do
like my full mmm get really with me
for this do your dinner not doing one of
these in ages so I thought you might
like to see a cut down version of what
exactly I did it
starting off with the Lamar eye cream I
also don't have that much time now which
is typical and I'm leave myself in a
five this kind of thing the Kiehl's
daily reviving concentrate
oil I'm gonna go in with the Chanel hide
your beauty micro cream which is one of
my absolute favorites and moisturizes
smells absolutely amazing massage that
in a little bit and plump up my skin as
a go just helps if you're going out at
nights out Lister then I'm gonna use the
lemare effecting treatment again and now
that's gonna be like a super moisturize
plum gooey cheese what I'm going for
okay so for base I'm gonna go for I have
missed be so much I'm gonna go from the
bare minerals back pro trusty lemare
brush okay
so super flawless base I just added a
sharp sharp taut shape tape and take my
eyes a little bit the NARS creamy
concealer just to make everything super
flawless and use my Real Techniques
sponge so everything's like very
flawless don't for change luminate a lot
of this he'll have seen before because
and honestly I'm not really changing it
up much the Real Techniques one even
incest bo2 and just work night into
contours and a little bit as a Browns
but mainly just to contour so eyes I'm
wearing a navy blue dress wanna go
something quite smoky so as always as I
always always do I'm just gonna lay down
a really easy base and when I use sickle
on hey nude eyeshadow which is
absolutely beautiful crease shades just
because it will also give me a really
matte base to start adding more color
onto and I might also even add a little
bit more of an orange tone to this
because orange and navy works so
nicely together it should look quite
nice I could talk to orange through the
crease here I'm going to use my new tart
toasted palate which I'm a little bit in
love with I got this the other day in
Sephora Chicago beautiful I'm just gonna
take the oranges and just kind of add
them to what I've got already just to
make this a little bit more kind of
terracotta orange tones and hopefully
that will just help to pop the blue when
I add that on top you know a little bit
and I know that usually people would do
her eyes first when they're doing quite
smoky dark oh I like this I forgot to do
that as I always do but to be honest I'm
also going to be using cream a dark
cream so I should be fine
fall out I think if not I've just
pounded my under eye just to help me out
I guess I do it get knee intensive fall
out but this is looking pretty good so
far I'm just making sure that I'm going
a little bit of my normal crease because
there's a way that my lids sit you won't
be able to see much of that orange
otherwise okay okay right so I've got
like that base down which is good now
then I am going to use the Tom Ford this
little guy in a a85 I don't know anyway
it's only this little part that comes
with the cream it's like a beautiful
Navy cream and I'm a top is ugly and I
would have looked reduced a Dior thing
I'm going to do but I don't have
anything dark blow from Dior actually
which the show yeah I'm not sure is
gonna go in with quite a small brush and
then I'm just gonna start working it
onto the outer part of the eye
kind of along the lashes fit the smoked
out line and then made me into this IATA
corner then that then I'm going to take
another fluffy brush it's just a Marc
Jacobs brush and to start blending it
into the outer corner like a smoky blue
outer corner really I'm not going as
high as the orange there I want to like
peek out and I can only get a bit more
after it's kind of good I can intensify
it and just kind of keep doing this
building up a few layers of this really
just so it gets more of a smoky blue eye
effect I mean we can actually see what
I'm doing here I realize the lighting is
awful but that light is broken because
Alex walked and right so I'm just gonna
do a little bit of bronzy gold because
my bag is like a bronzy antique gold I'm
gonna put a little bit here so I'm gonna
was wet my brush my flat brush and again
this is not the perfect gold here a bit
more deeper than a champagne gold
antique want to put a little bit on this
in a corner in here just for a little
bit of a sparkle almost as if I was like
cutting the crease a little bit just for
a little bit and now fails to blend that
into the blue touch more I mean if I was
like a super pro makeup guru and forever
like use concealer to cut the crease
however I have 35 minutes to not only
get this finished but also do my hair
and put my outfit so I don't quite have
that time I mean you actually does have
that kind of time I really like that the
blue of the gold super cute and before I
start blending I'm just gonna go for me
in a corner and as always this is always
made of corn highlight color the L'Oreal
la palette nude in Rosie I believe but I
just find it's the best in a corner
haunt me to show the best a part in
blend it in a little bit I really like
their brush blend the blue over the gold
it's more about the blue than it is
about the gold okay okay last year's I'm
not doing liner because that blue kind
of axes my liner and I wouldn't have any
makeup on but in tonight's bottom line X
it would just solve everything
so I'm gonna do a mixture of the scar is
the it cosmetics of scarring I have only
been using this for the past few weeks
and if that wasn't thick and luscious
enough I'm gonna go in with the Dior
pump for volume finally I've got a deal
product in this routine don't know
what's taking me so long cuz I make
everything super thick a little bit
spidery come all about the intense eyes
today I'm looking youthful the mere
bronzer it's nice in it
bronzed ooh gonna go got a brand-new
brand-new Marni bronzer brush to use and
it's so exciting
oh it's not clogged with product it's
brand new bristles it's just wonderful I
went by the way I want to look super
bronzy so I've been putting on a lot I
mean - I don't really have time to tan
some scratch all night fake it by
extreme bronzing this is one of the most
pigmented bronzes they wanna sit I've
ever found is you let's just need a dab
dab dab and then pretty good to go then
alright I want to do it more do your
products gonna do products in here
wonderful highlighter this isn't zero
zero for the nude air
I wanna go wrong seriously it's amazing
and it just kind of like sinks into the
skin nothing else and brow bone over the
brow bone a little bit here and there
it's honestly I want to see the most
amazing powders
I'm gonna go for this estee lauder
oh sure quite deep and rich in a bit
terra cotta rune that's kind of what I'm
after it's going to go back in with our
bombs a brush and just blend a bit of
that together in bronze I'm highlighted
okay I was gonna go for dark pink limp
but I don't think that's a good idea
I'm just gonna stick with nudes Rimmel
cappuccino liner it's my favorite and
it's just quite frankly the best
I'm obviously over drawing because who
doesn't want bigger lips we want to go
for this the Dior matte fluid in 0:05
okay little Hank that it looks quite
bumpy and then what really do is add a
lighter or later nude to the inside okay
so these team eyebrows so you know
probably I'm gonna use benefit brow
powder foolproof I'm gonna go over the
front gimme brow in number three and
then set it all with ready Sarah okay
I'm done I'm done I'm full glam in full
glam I just moved out a little bit to my
inside of my lips and no idea what I'm
gonna do my hair okay guys
I'm ready I've gone full flick with my
hair this is my dress so pretty and I've
got the questioned your underwear on
underneath my choker but we're a lot but
this is perfect it's kind of think after
I'll show you in the mirror
isn't it beautiful dress separate bit
more grungy the boots yeah obviously my
face is not really Balam and smoky and
fact the one thing I could maybe add is
some eyeliner and as a liner okay
I'm totally ready I have my dear lady do
your art bag which is absolutely
incredible in antique gold that I
mentioned and in this dress it's just so
beautiful ready to go to the ball
