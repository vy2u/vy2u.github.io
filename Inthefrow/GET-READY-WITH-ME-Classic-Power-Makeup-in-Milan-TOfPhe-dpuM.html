ready with me from the Armani Hotel in
Milan which is one of my favorite hotels
it's just so beautiful so I was here
with our money to go to the Armani show
for Milan Fashion Week which was
extremely exciting and this is me
getting ready before the show so I'm
just using the LMS cleansing gel and
it's just really uplifting and Awakening
and refreshing for the morning it's
really really lovely and here I'm coming
you see LMS soothing apricot toner it's
just really easy to use it's like you
can spray it all over your face you have
to use like a cotton pad and wipe out
all of your face it was really really
easy of course I need to also brush my
teeth
some of using my electric toothbrush and
some cargo toothpaste and on this
morning I decided that I was going to
have a bath this is a little bit back to
front and for usually I'd have my bath
and then I do all my face washing
routine but it just kind of happened
this way so I just made use of the
wonderful products that are my leaves
around the bathroom such as the Armani
Prive shower gel through loads of that
into the bath so I had lots of bubbles
and in Sebastian little bits like 10
minutes or some really chill and can't
get my mind in the right frame of mind
for the day and then it's time for my
makeup routine okay
so kicking it off with the lemare
theorem since that brand-new serum it's
really lovely really kind of hydrating
on the skin and the eye cream is
Charlotte Tilbury which is a fave right
now the Armani primer balm is just so
moisturizing and the most beautiful
texture and also really glowy
well for extra glow I'm adding in
Victoria Beckham and Estee Lauder
morning aura which just has that
beautiful morning glow to the skin it's
stunning so it's all about this amazing
new foundation Armani the power fabric
foundation it's about high coverage
flawless skin it's a brand new offering
from Armani into their range of
different foundations if you know Armani
well you know they have incredible
foundations this is their sort of high
coverage flawless offering and I
absolutely love it it's really beautiful
without being too
key it's really great so here I'm adding
lots of shape tape concealers and tile
at the top as I do love my concealer for
that extra perfection and also my eyes
are looking a little bit exhausted
recently so we'll need all the help they
can get and now with a super flawless
base for moving back into shaping and
structuring my face my cheekbones and my
temples and outside of my nose and my
chin with the Chanel Soleil to tundish
nail and then even more bronzer over top
this is the are my bronzer and now my
brush I'm just like a really bronze base
I'll be honest a little bit of comics so
that my lips can start to get a bit more
hydrated and moisturize before I have
some lipstick later on here I'm just
adding a bit of blush Marc Jacobs this
one is stunning it's so beautiful it's
like Beijing and tan kind of mixtures
Gorge touch the highlighter with the
Armani powder highlighter before moving
into a little bit of powdering just in
areas I feel I need it most
I generally don't powder much because my
face is so dry we know again I'll add a
little bit if I feel that I need it to
last and last and last and moving into
the eyes this is the Armani item I will
leave the exact number down below as all
the numbers of all the other products as
well but I'm creating a really large cat
eyes slick with the eyeshadow rather
than using any liners or anything it's
kind of quite minimal but still somewhat
kind of smoky and smoked out and smudgy
that's the kind of look I was going for
so a lot powerful and much more kind of
sophisticated while still being really
quite low key so I'm just throwing on
some mascara since the Clarins
waterproof mascara just to hold the tail
and over the top for even more volume
I'm adding the Armani Accenture coat
which is one of my absolute favorite
mascaras no changes here my eyebrows are
done with the Armani eyebrow maestro in
number two and the Armani brush and
spoolie because quite frankly it's one
of the best out there and I love it and
why more people don't use it because I'm
so obsessed I love it so I haven't
changed this in about two years so I'm
sorry little bit for that but
understanding some mascara to my bottom
lashes here as well so she'll need a
little bit more definition around the
eyes and finishing off the face would be
armed
Arni prima missed then it's about the
lips I'm using these Yvonne sheet read I
think it's like me 0-5 we're going to
leave the number down below in the
description bar I was lining my lips so
they kind of perfected before you from
the Armani urban guerrilla red shade you
can only get this in the brand new
Armani pop-up that's in Covent Garden
and it's mine kind of red like super
cherry style red is beautiful a little
bit more bronze like do you never have
too much I don't think and then be
makeup look is complete so this look was
all about being powerful sophisticated
confident woman so I've got this
incredible black blazer from Armani to
wear for this look and this little
Armani bag as well so this woman's going
out in my wardrobe
getting myself ready before I start
doing my hair so I didn't bring my hair
my hair is super straight I already
straightened excellent relief under done
cameras they're boring just really
easily straightened it and now I'm
putting it back just into a very
slicked-back pony brushing it back and
tying it up with a little tie and then
I'm using the Loreal sleek it this is a
brilliant sort of gel that you can run
over any flyaways and any small hair
that you want to slicked back and make
everything really sleek so it works so
perfectly to this look and then just
make sure that doesn't go anywhere and
just adding some a locket hairspray as
well from L'Oreal you must forget just
how easy this look is it looks so
sophisticated I love it so much
oh and to finish obviously I need a
little bit of Armani sense this is the
Rouge malachite from Armani Prive is
stunning I mentioned in my favourites
video recently my new favorite okay
through now my blazer this is my
finished look guys I'll leave us a link
down below of course but I really loved
it I felt very kind of confidence just
created a woman like I said that was
kind of what I was going for very
powerful woman look having everything
into my bag I've got my phone I've got
my room key I've got my money in my
Christian Dior looking card holder my
Carmex my Siobhan she read and
my arm re red lipstick and finally my sd
card connectors to my iPhone so I can
get all my pictures off quickly and
that's it guys I hope you enjoyed this
look and thank you so much for watching
