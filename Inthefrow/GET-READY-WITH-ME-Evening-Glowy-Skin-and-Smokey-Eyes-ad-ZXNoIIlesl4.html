doing so so well welcome to a makeup
look this very flawless radiant glowy
glossy evening if I do this video is
very kindly sponsored by Rimmel which
you didn't know I have recently worked
Rimmel on their remote road trip over in
Manchester
so remind currently working with quite a
few different influences there are
twelve of us I believe and they're
visiting six different cities in the UK
and I went over to Manchester to see
Hannah Renee who I've never met before
always wanted to meet her she's absolute
beautiful we have so much fun on the
road trip and pretty much I'm kind of
drove us around the world came up with
different places to go and to eat and to
have fun it was honestly so much fun so
please do watch that video I'll leave it
links on screen I'll also leave it
linked down below and pretty much in
that I created a full evening look a
daytime look and an evening look and for
this video I wanted to recreate
everything that I did changing off a few
products but generally the whole lot
will be very very similar you can also
shop this look on liz london look I'll
leave a link down below where you can
have shot all the Rimmel products I've
used in this whole look which makes it
super easy so this looks I created I
created on at the Rimmel road trip and
it's much more of a kind of glossy glowy
and a little bit smoky on the eyes look
nothing too hard to recreate but I think
perfect for an evening look for date
night and also for wedding des makeup so
if you're going to a wedding scene for
the evening do I think something like
this would be so perfect so that's why
Curtis mentioned this is wedding evening
date night all that kind of shebang
everything that you need what kind of an
evening looks at flowy and region and
really pretty I'm really pleased this
whole lot and how its come out I'm over
the moon with it and they do a full day
of filming now with this whole look on I
love it so hopeful if you love it too
then you will keep on watching
okay first thing is first I'm gonna wrap
up this hair because that's just ready
now
throws whitehead gals this helps well
let's get straight in here with some
skincare start off with skincare with
the Vichy of qualia serum lovely and
refreshing and I can't do my makeup
amount of serum eye cream the Aquarians
eye cream all products of course will be
listed down below in order of use going
in with my firm favorites the lemare
renewal oil and the moisturizing soft
cream it was mixed those on the back of
my hand mix them together and of life I
still like the texture from the cream
mix of the oil just makes our face feel
really hydrated get that hydration
okay skin care down and we're going to
go with SEO audit illuminating
perfecting primer I'm actually use this
yet but I tried it on the back of my
hand a few weeks ago I was like oh okay
quite a pearlescent priming crew it's
going to apply light and all the usual
places there are like ooh thrown across
my cookies and especially much in
because that's where I lose my leg first
okay often skincare down let's get on
with that makeup so anyone that's been
watching my childhood past few years
back in the day you'll play note I used
to love the weight milk foundation and
the wake me up concealer I probably use
them as one of my most used products on
my channel as a big big fan so this has
just been sort of re formulated with
added vitamin C for anti fatigue now
since of even better it wasn't it's also
SPF 20 now too so even better than
before
it's got a summon up the Beckham s tend
just use any stippling brush this is a
good call to meet the missus ivory I've
currently got a bit of a turn on salts
town arm a ass I don't turn ever not
fair but yeah this works really well for
me at the moment
I'm gonna do love this foundation I have
so much sort of radiance got quite a
nice glow to it it's not overly glowy
like it's not the most glowy foundation
over use so for anyone who doesn't want
too much globe often when I'm at this is
such a great door between I think and if
you do prefer a bit more agents and just
add like a radiance primer or a soft
glow illuminating cream in with the
foundation and a sort of thing helps for
even more but it isn't every day this is
a warden
Foundation it really is yeah it's such
beautiful coverage I love that so much
beautiful okay
bit of concealer some going in with the
waiting up concealer of course which I
believe is ivory in my usual way when I
draw on the triangle you're right in
front in a corner again sort of sort of
really brightening as a lot of radiance
into the skin
what's also offering a really good
coverage I think
I'm just going to use a damp beauty
blender to blend that in but you know me
I used to like to add maybe three
concealers so today I'm just going to go
in with a little bit extra of the NARS
concealer soft matte in canal and I want
to go in with my Beauty Blender and just
Pat that over the top of anybody's
little extra help especially with these
scarves at moment I just need a little
extra coverage and this is covering
without being sticky okay pivot so we've
got a really good base down now so I
think I might do the eyes first before I
do like contour and all that I'm gonna
stick on some carnet as always my
favorite just so it's a nice and correct
for later down upwards going to use the
Rimmel Kate sculpting palette this is in
the shade coral glow I believe there is
a slightly dark shade as well this is
beautiful and it's such a great palette
like the highlight is fantastic because
they're brilliant bronzing Shea
contouring shade and this is also very
pretty blush like I use all of these in
this palette which i think is amazing
when you find a palette that has so many
different things in it that you can
really get yourself up to makes it
totally like value for money I'm just
using a real techniques brush
I'm just using this to blend into my
crease as for we are creating an evening
look quite often LG's a slightly lighter
shade for my crease but with this being
evening I just want to kind of warm it
up from the word go really and I adore
using my bronzer like whatever I'm using
at my contour and on my bronzing areas
of my face I also like to add into the
eyes I think it really like ties in the
colors beautifully and much more
naturally not this he's got a very
natural look by any means but still but
I also wanna make this look really easy
to follow I have so many friends and
family members who are pretty useless at
makeup their words not mine but they
always tell me like I can't do this or I
can't do that I've never tried this I'm
too scared to do there and I'm always if
I watch some of my tutorials or watch
them looks like create on YouTube it
might keep it of an idea of how to do
something and I think that sometimes
you're a bit scared to watch because
they're worried it's going to be too
difficult for them and you could totally
do it I see what you guys could totally
recreate a look like this it just takes
a bit of practice and just being
confident with China so I wanted to
create this look also being pretty easy
to do this is going to be pretty damn
simple really but also really sort of
wearable something you could easily wear
anytime key actually done that was going
to go in with the magnifies the remote
magnifies stay true color and this is in
Queen of the bronze age I believe on one
side is very pretty champagne gold I'm
going to use that on the very inner area
in a corner of my eye and sort of surf
the first third of my eyelid anyone
could do this you destroy down pat it in
you could use a brush if you want to
just build up the color that way
so sparkly and pretty just really
catches alight beautifully anyway on the
other side this is my favorite court
system or bronzey showed I do use my
luck the other day but this just goes on
the second half the outer half of the
eyelid I love it over the middle really
I think more of this color than the
champagne you want on your I like all
the amid just like that and then I'm
going to do is take an easy blending
brush this is 41-7 from Mac which if I'm
honest I couldn't do my makeup without
this brush I don't think it's one of
those kind of like Holy Grail items that
most people have in their collection but
if you're going to get into makeup and
you're quite new to it I fear so
recommend investing in this one brush
it's just the perfect size for most eye
shapes and it really helps with blending
so it's always myself bringing that a
little bit underneath the eye and then
out in the same direction so it kind of
creates really large shadowed cat eye
because this look isn't going to have an
eyeliner in it's not going to have any
false lashes because I don't use either
of those things anymore
well flushes I've never really use often
only every now and again when I come
with aa bird and liner I stopped wearing
about a year ago probably because I have
such sensitive eyes to wind sunlight
that I was from a nightmare every time
that I tried to wear eyeliner
it would just be down my face and I'm
really kind of all over that so instead
I like to intensify the shape and at
market I flip look using shadows it's
going to go back in with the Cape
palette again and that bronzing shade
just working to the crease a little bit
more do you want this look to be quite
chance really and all off the warmth is
scarce
just into the crease and then I'm just
going to use the Rimmel pallet glam eyes
quad eyeshadow in smokey Bruns
0:02 and with this I'm going to take a
little bit of these lighter champagne e
shade and just touch up this inner
corner just for even more intent and the
shadows will cling onto that lovely
cream that we have been
since we use the darker shade in this
palette as well and axis again it's
going to go into the crease and the
outer portion of the eye again just to
intensify this color
okay love that really still very
easy to wear quite not natural but it's
not to other topics not to many
different layers and something that you
can't really achieve so okay now it's
time to contour I'm back to my cake
sculpting perlite day taking any kind of
easy sculpting brush I'm going to start
to now upkeep
next time our lenders so taking out all
over a bit our cheeks on the cheekbones
around the temples and all over a little
bit contouring and mainly sort of more
bronzing to be honest the walls vary for
the highlight I'm just going to use the
Rimmel good to glow in 0:01 nothing kill
glow adding that to the back of my hand
first
I prefer to if I've been taking a brush
love innocence and then finding my
cheeks they go please let go I hope you
can
a highlight so gorgeous and this is
really good as well for adding into the
foundation for how uses before and mix
it in weird week milk foundation I just
add even more urgent sense of skin happy
that looks so pretty and so easy as well
have through never bonobos gorgeous I
love that a lot now I could use this
lush in the sculpting palette but I
decided I'm going to see two slightly
different blush and it's this one the
Rimmel lasting finish soft color blush
in Sumter Rose which i think is kind of
one of those like blushes everyone
probably has in their collection at some
point a very light just EOS page rose
shade but my sign of shade scored for
for George and you know what thing is
this is an evening look I'm going to go
in with the highlight from the Cape
palette in Suffolk's
anglo spray my brush I'm going to
straight into this palette like this cup
some powder
I've got tiny bit extra
so mascara I'm going to use the Rimmel
volume shape which is like their new
mascara the shaky not just helps to keep
a little bit more fresh and admob
product onto the brush but this is a
really really great mascara really like
that the well I think I'm gonna do some
ISO is just a little bit cold I'm going
to add the soft core liner in sable
Brown that's going to go on my lower
lash line and also my upper lash line
the inside is kind of a deep not
everything so I'm going to this off
camera because otherwise it's gonna be
very hard to do okay awesome
it looks silky and sexy and pretty but
it's not too over top and I think very
cheerful now let's get these brows on
because I'm just looking a bit odd at
the moment with no brows this one's
going to get the shape a little bit with
the Anastasia of a hill sit brow and
chocolate when I get a little bit more
shape before I start to fill them still
and then I'm going to use this brown
this way through one ultra soft powder
this is really soft in a bit of
nursing's in like it like a dusty
powdery soft brush tip very unique but
it really sort of clings onto all the
hairs and it really makes them look
thicker
and it's a really fast way to fill in
the brows
I also really like this shade oh wow
that is statement bro Oh baby from here
I go yeah I'm loving this and then I
look look at my view phone I'm like wow
it's all good a little good strong brow
and push through it a little bit by this
is a medium color if you're wondering
I'm just coming you say she's long she
missed a brow
groom brush them up a little bit and to
set them in place if you like strong
brows you don't have to do it I'm just
going to add a little bit of a glow this
way into my inner corner so with most of
the face pretty much done just lets to
go and my favorite part this whole thing
is going to be cappuccino lip liner
laughing finish lip contouring pencil
this is a dream I've used a few times
recently
so I've drawn slightly over line and
then use your finger sort of disperse
the products and blend it a little it
just gives really much more natural lip
shape while also really enhancing it
then but it add the rock-and-roll mood
in the lasting finish by Kate lipstick
from remarked that like dabbing it onto
lips and then finish the forty icing
finish my Kate lipstick in 40 which is a
little light nude difference is very
center to switz more of an ombre finish
with a spritz of the insta-fix and girl
we need a second one thing I added a
little bit of gloss music Estee Lauder
discreet nude gala just a little bit of
cool
I did my look for them in our road trip
I used the Oso gloss lip tint which was
just a soft sparkling beautiful Ashley
but I seem to have misplaced that I'm
not sure so this is just as lovely okay
I think we're done
so my share I've just washed and then I
care of my hair just with the GHD barrel
I'll leave the exact one linked down
below in the description bar but this is
sort of thing I go for small kind of
light bungee waves
there's loads of volume from the way to
get that this sort of volume is I'll
kill my hair I in parting kill it and
then we it's all done then kind of
usually have to flip over a section and
you'll get loads more volume through it
okay so I think we are done guys I hope
you liked this look this is really
really good fun to put together actually
and it's so now sort of thinking back to
what I used on the real road trip back
in Manchester and if they have so much
fun in car na and the whole rimmel t of
