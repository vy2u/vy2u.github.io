and I have to get ready so I'm going to
event later and so what I'm doing to get
ready then I also have an eating that
I'm going to in 14 minutes I need to
leave so I saw I have to quickly do this
and get ready
this is a very rush to get rid of me but
it's not for all of you guys that are in
ever the same situation I need to get
ready super fast then this may be
helpful so I'm going with a white
jumpsuit tonight so I thought I'd go
with a really sleek straight and pale
look which I go often do but that's
what's going on
and also I've had colored in court the
color is awesome it's so nice not to
have root but could it so shocks we've
got enough white Allah dead ends but I'm
sure that we didn't need to get this
show but miss mine always always happens
will let me go to the hairdresser I'm
just using the Loreal Pro heat it hot
and curl hold spray as well and I'll not
curling my hair today but should work
just as well like I said I'm going to
the meeting so coming to get myself
ready to this meeting and ready to the
event at the same time so want to get
back after the meeting I don't have to
do 20,000 different things okay so let
the speed makeup commence I already put
on I literally slathered on primary
layer protection treatment primer I've
got like these your your hydrating
lotion underneath I've got some mi
serum.i Joseph's not so let's just get
right into this bad boy I'm going to
start off first of all with a little bit
of the bare minerals concealer in fair
to go over these ridiculous blemishes
and spots I've got right now I'm just
also to a bit color correcting refers
off and in fact as well I will turn it
into this I do if you saw my insta video
a day using this with so street light
green bits off any redness and my
favorite thing about it it's really
really good I'm just going to count in
okay that's already better so much
better already
okay foundation I'm going to mix a few
okay this is brand brand-new brand new
yet some sausages is to brand new George
Armani power of fabric foundation its
chemical in a silk
well heavy coverage so it's been looking
for a heavy coverage foundation from
Armani this is it I'm going to mix it
win this is so good
I think I'll show you supposedly L'Oreal
news mashite cushion Susan 0-4 and I
literally just like going into this with
my sponge
going straight on the face of it and I
take a little bit of this as well and
just go for it so the thing about a
luminous cushion a limit cushion what
doing about L'Oreal cushion is that this
is just so wonderful chewy it gives me
that really illumise Julie coverage that
I love to this it also is really good
like medium coverage and power fabric
and it just have really great coverage
and I'm in shape 3.5 I love that show
you on these well plus I'm going to an
event tonight and that's a reason why I
want really great juniors also flawless
coverage right now it is so hard
struggle is real for those who have
wiped or blonde hair when it comes to
adding foundations you want to have come
skin is so difficult not to get it in
your hairline okay cool I'm going to add
a bit of the ghulam concealer I have
zero one my skin feels like it some of
those moves but just want to take in any
product because I'm rushing and of
course it's not going to let me do
anything when I resumed because that
would just be nice okay cool cool cool
cool I'll go with this now slay can dish
it out on my server makeup forever brush
turn up that face I went to bronze Umaga
kind of contour area kind of thing but
lips for me okay I need to make this
tighter so going to get into my hairline
by the way in my last few videos this is
pretty much the makeup that I did I have
so many requests for that makeup
tutorial so but you know this is it it
yes nice and bronzed and it's going to
add even more bronze or the tops with
big alarm falsies and from an Irish just
to kind of power that down a little bit
and also a touch more coarse plus it
means I can bronze Dominic for blush I
am in love with a little combo right now
the Sonia Rykiel
Lancome collaboration they did and
pretty sure you can still get this on my
actual eggs is in the shade sorbet rose
and I like to use a Real Techniques
contour brush with this how's the excess
from like my hand there isn't it work in
put cheeks and it's such a chewy creamy
pink and can add a touch of my fav
Charlotte Tilbury first love over top
not essential but quite like the waves
cause mix for
or highlights I'm going to go with the
Cooper Saxe highlight in moonlight I
would be using probably my liquid ones
but there's just not enough time to
arrive now I need to sit so pretty and
please my egoistical all over all of
that and make sure it's all comes
actually full ended into the bronze and
blend into the highlight and it's not
too much blush and all that really okay
we're not going to do that so about 20
minutes we've got 20 minutes I have
never got lose my sort of summer foot
I'm going to go back in with the
infallible oil available correcting
palette and just add a little bit
because some are correcting ones just to
Mountain Drive I was at a pound
concealer as my life concealers I find
almost like shocks it all in I hate my
nails of Commerce's took summer to
palette is so so good okay now for I
should I lift that off with the
Maybelline Color tattoo in from the road
this is just a very very good color for
neutral and it makes a really good base
and it also make any actually look goes
on top of this stick a lot better and it
will also stay a lot longer and look a
little brighter if it easy peasy but I
mean it looks like my eyelids participa
brighter sedated next thing I'm going to
use the Golan eyes shadow in hey nude
this is a really great nude brown that
it's going to be my crocheted do I ever
do my make up that difference I don't
think so so to this point it's only 14
minutes that's not that bad
well nearly got eyes and lips to do now
I'm pleased also think this is going to
be my next video
after my really chatty video I'll leave
the link on the screen now from there if
you didn't see that video but just
nothing else to thank you so how my
people engaged and commented on that
video and left me feedback that was
amazing I don't think I've ever got that
many kind of comments before such an
amazing positive comment and just
talking about what you thought about the
video and what you think about my
and it was incredible feedback so thank
you so much to all of you guys that
comment usually and also everyone that
decided to comment that one time just to
really help me out I can really really
appreciate it and couldn't believe how
many of you have commented and I've read
through every single one I try and
comment back to as many as I can but I
honestly read every single one and it
was incredible feedback now you can kind
of collated it into a bit of a graph
into a bit of a spreadsheet of what you
said and how many of you said you wanted
such types of videos and other types of
videos it was so helpful for thank you
so much as a donation to my crease this
is it's just a really beautiful quite
neutral natural transition shade I'm
upset look I shadow and it's so easy
stick that on there
okay then right this is the product to
our maps what is digging right now so
the beauty pie highlighter this is
insane as a highlighter it's incredible
but I have been loving it as an eye
shadow with so many of you recently
thing like what have you got in your
eyes it's very very nice and this is it
I just comes with Patti are those of it
this is a powder and you still got to
have a couple coats it'll just look
lovely shimmery we catch into light Nala
at lacers and so it's very pretty
yeah my legs gone I'm dad my legs down
also marks I'm just one second
awesome go on let down some super lit
okay that's a little better
can she see me a little bit now and I'm
so not so I thought any more life is
coming back into my tone this is really
embrace we're going to go back over a
little bit more also go on again just a
to make sure it's bit of a transition of
color here called the tulip shop I've
got 15 minutes can I can do it in 15
minutes
and I'm going to buff it and that's like
super easy oh I love it I love it
it and a couple powder that the Laura
Mercier powder and I'm back on a little
brush for this I was using a sponge but
now I'm back on the Real Techniques
setting brush just talked a little bit
into the brush and then tap it into the
lid negative if you got a look on your
brush and then I just work it into under
eyes disabilities here
Jen knows this area Panos and like hello
you need some powder every single day
and then just decide
although I can definitely feel like my
skin is a bit dry today Don what
happened to it very good
one day my skin's like lapping up the
powder it's like yes all the days it's
like now would you dry we don't need it
what's on it behind you anyway okay so
powder done let's finish off he is going
to go into my iconic London palette and
at the moment and you can do this with
any slight highlight cream you've got
but I'm just really enjoying taking this
lightest highlight color and it just
very gently adding this to my inner
corners because it's cream it's somewhat
pigmented and really gets on there
really well cause God knows I love a
good inner corner highlight and then
when I've laid that down I'm going to go
into any color like Ryan I'm going to is
from terminated palette naked ultimate
basics the lightest shade in here I'm
just going to go over the tops women in
my village
Oh blends nicely okay now it's nice and
they are almost almost there I'm also
going to add a little bit to Shanta car
and obsessed with the mermaid I call it
in copper is like super pressed
beautiful pigment like such an eye
shadow it's not technically pigment oh
you're so pigmented I like to add a
touch of that into the very middle see I
just a little more warmth and bronze
there it's just a shimmery to beautify
but just without bitter Branson a
different color it is just okay let's
quickly Deandra how shall we season the
Armani Spoony brushing laser
well I really need to talk okay no time
no time I was using the Armani and back
on the Armani brand maestro game just
come quite enjoying slightly lighter
brows and I know a lot of you commented
our recent video things that you liked
them a bit like too so thank you
the only difference is that I'm not
quite using as much product because I
have my eyebrows guide so that if I had
them guide I barely got that much
product in anymore which means that
don't build it up it doesn't get darker
it's just a lot easier to do them
I'm still loving this your pharmacy mr.
green this is just really great at
specimen in place and I like to really
push the front up and the same with this
air is really all up the brows I lay
across and then just push down the ends
get a bit more volume all the way across
one thing I hate of that makeup me I
love everything about makeup apart from
doing brows and what it is recently I'm
just really fed up of doing my brows you
know because it's just the same every
day
this little our brows go to my brows
that way just me and I go for some
mascara brand new Armani it's in chico
mascara my absolute favorite I just have
my eyelashes listed so they're
performing a little bit right now tell
me on I've got seven minutes before
after me I am so enough I got the sky
literally how beautiful is that mascara
and I'm going to go in with my needs
maybe you see Shanti Karl lipliner in
discrete obsessed so let's get rid of
that this is again the lips looks at
Madinat every video and ever Instagram
for the past 5 weeks the line as babies
we shall my bigger lips but you can't
have everything okay and then these are
insane bare minerals marvelous my
favorite moment is in smooch because of
that gorgeous light pink it's the vector
hombres and these are smells silver
Hillary and beautiful under success and
tighten that in to get a really cute
matte lip look okay one minutes rather
leave I'm going you from the an eye
cream that refreshing makeup fix
amazing right so I'm going to go now to
many things and going to come back and
potentially look at my makeup may be a
bottom lashes or face but I kind of just
want to go like this really will see
right so I'll see you in a second okay
I'm back
right
it's going to do a little extra bit and
I'm not going to touch you up from where
I was before I left so that everything
looks for sitting the only things I
really do is ask some more bran because
this is Martha it is more of a big event
I'm going to be bitten Bronx definition
of tongue but can yesterday and not need
this much bronzer different penalties
after to add a little bit of the mary
lou manizer cooking on a little bit more
shimmer forget how amazing this stuff is
we will forget to use it it is so good
okay i feel like because it is an
evening mark I'm going to put some
bottom lashes go okay let's are back and
the one thing I just want to do is just
deepen up this eye a little tiny bit and
when I mix a bit of the darker Brown and
then you touch into the dark purple and
just work it into the very outer corner
very quickly little little bit extra
color might work that juice down into
lower lashes are you a killer just
taking us from like a really simple look
to something a little bit more glam but
I'm quite enjoying it in terms of carpet
I think I'm going to wear what seems
went this incredible jumpsuit I'm pretty
sure you should still be able to get
this actually illegally download this by
heart
in fact I Wallis already to the gleam
party but didn't take any pictures let
it take any videos so I'm not
technically wrong on it if no all sorry
I didn't wear it and I absolutely love
this jumpsuit I'm going to wear that and
I'm gonna wear that with things I wear
them with these yummy trophies maybe
with my white and nude ones I'm not
decided yet but I think potential Aziz
because I'll go with the colors nicely
they're a little bit more nude and gold
with this little Valentino roxas which
are so in love I'm not why not yet I
think that me to see since hips a little
bit more unknown effects
oh good for hair I'm just going to brush
it back three sleek going to use a
little bit of the L'Oreal sugar proulx
leak it as well
this is really nice your ad sees a sleek
look to the end of it all tidy and nice
and if you want to sort of put away any
flyaways just kind of like my secret
weapon I kind of was like tuck it behind
my ears that whole kind of feel I'm
gonna finish off with a bit of neck
cookie can't really beat it put it on to
the hands to the sleek I like it okay
I also perfume of the night my absolute
favorite right now I'll be Armani see
liquor farm a few different ones this is
the one that has like more amber note
which is a little bit more expensive
because ingredients are more expensive
and more exquisite that are inside it
yeah bottom of this is more like amber

jumpsuit ready okay Andrea try it
everything not for you so you can see it
all together
