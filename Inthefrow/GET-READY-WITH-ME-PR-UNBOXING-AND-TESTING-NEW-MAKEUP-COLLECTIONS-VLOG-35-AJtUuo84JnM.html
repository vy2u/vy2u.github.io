I'll do you one it's gonna be quite a
long video let me know once you set
aleksef mr. Lynch that's the one thing
about this house we don't have a dining
room table so we've kind of got used to
now like sit on the floor together I'll
sit on this table if any of you guys
have this issue where you have a flat
and not enough room for dining room or
dining room table but you found a way
around it in terms of how you eat like
whether it's like a cool table that use
or whether it's a really good like map
that you've got a crostini or anything
let me know because we need something
that's small that we can kind of keep
and eat on our laps with what is this

YUM
so i i've overloaded my my closet with
stuff and I ran out of hunger so I just
bought a load of new hangers from Amazon
they're like what was it thirty thirteen
pounds like thirty awesome so I thought
I'd bring you into here to watch me hang
up our clothes pretty much
put a tiebreaker dress the jacket knit
into the network section so because we
talked about all these different
products earlier I thought I'd put them
on my face and I'm just trying out the
laura mercier flawless fusion ultra long
wear foundation in the shade macadamia
it's actually really really nice it
looks super super natural and if I said
the word supernatural it's just sounds
silly because it's a supernatural is
actual word it looks really natural on
the skin but also quite covering eight

another go but I'm submit I really want
to give these Clarins cushions a try
