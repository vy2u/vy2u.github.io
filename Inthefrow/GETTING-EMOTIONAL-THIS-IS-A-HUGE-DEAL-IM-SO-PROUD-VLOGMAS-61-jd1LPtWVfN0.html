control over where I place things on the

designed it that way if not longer than
that so I've been doing that all morning
it's a brand new post with the Tiffany
perfume which I've just put on I'll show

an amazing an amazing gift it's been
dropped off from Ted Baker it's there an
exclusive baker's dozen
Ted 13 gifts of Christmas it's like an
advent calendar

full-on Ted Baker gift box so Thank You
Ted Baker for this incredible gift
actually I can let you guys in on a bit
of a secret now because I'll say this
isn't in real time my Instagram will be
but tomorrow I am going to be putting up
an Instagram to promote the fact that
this season I am a face of Ted Baker how
cool I am a while back now in the vlogs
a couple of months ago you might have
seen on the vlog that I was with Ted
bacon I was doing something that I
wasn't able to say like a lot of do
anyway I was shooting that day with the
whole Ted make a team for their
Christmas campaign imagery so I'm gonna
go on the website on
they're advertising on their Instagram
advertising that beautiful beautiful
Christmas collection
it's a massive deal yeah it's it's a
really really huge deal I think
sometimes it's really hard in this
industry because you see so many people
doing amazing things really cool awesome
things all the time and it's hard to not
compare or to forget the cool things
you're doing and think oh well they're
doing really cool things maybe I should
be doing more and I'm not working hard
enough it's really easy to do that in
this industry and to compare yourself
against really hard-working amazing
people and I know everyone does it
everyone and I know I can be I can do it
sometimes - I mean I've learnt a lot now
not to really do that and compare as
much as I used to but now and again that
feeling creeps in when you don't feel
like you're good enough but this is one
of those moments at the moment I'm
really trying to realize how many cool
amazing opportunities that come my way
recently I feel extremely lucky I feel
extremely grateful and thankful for all
of the support from everyone and I'm
just like Ella support from everyone
around me as well and friends and family
who always made me continue and push on
and all that and the fact that
particular brands are so supportive of
me and really believe in me and the
person I am and the content I created my
imagination and my ideas and one of
those brands has been Ted Baker for a
few years now I've worked with a baker I
adore them I draw the collections they
are wonderful people and that they
wanted me as a face of their collection
is just absolutely amazing
there are as far as I know in terms of
fashion there are I can't think of any
but I'm sure they're one or two I'm a
very little bloggers in the UK who have
had the chance to be a face of a brand
so I need to kind of realize that this
is an absolutely huge deal it's amazing
such a huge established brand that Ted
Baker that wanted me almost as their
model for this season is amazing
I don't want to get emotional but I'm
just so thankful
yeah it was extremely thankful for the
support and the belief from such a
wonderful group of people and an amazing
and so yeah so tomorrow I'm putting up
my Instagram to tell everyone about it
and I believe they've already just put
up first
in fact so I think a lot of people might
already know about it I'm extremely
extremely proud
I'm just so I feel so lucky to be part
of it yeah I'm gonna go now so I'm just
gonna making an extra-large crumpet
I've got fish fingers in the oven I'm
going to take off my makeup
hopefully my hair will do for tomorrow I
have a breakfast at 7:50 a.m. the cast
pick me up for an 8:30 breakfast so I
don't want to be in bed too late so I'm
gonna start getting ready now and
