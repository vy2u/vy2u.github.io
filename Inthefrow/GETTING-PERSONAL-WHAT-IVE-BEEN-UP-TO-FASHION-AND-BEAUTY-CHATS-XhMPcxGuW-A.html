who's gonna be a QA I haven't filled a
QA in God knows how long it's gonna be
over here pull it on her than that a
long time so I have two guys to ask me
anything on Twitter and Instagram with
AK in the fro if you don't already
follow me on Instagram or Twitter make
sure to follow me I'll leave my lengths
or handles on the screen now yeah so for
me so the next time you will know if
there's an ask in the fro and you can
join in too
yes this is gonna get into this thing
it's been so long since I've just kind
of tried with you and not been shying
about products and things I mean kind of
excited about this kind of you know
one-to-one meeting you you know that
comes back okay so let's see what you
guys are saying okay Vanessa if you're
not on a plane and the pilot offer to
fly it anywhere where would you go
me and Alex would probably go New
Zealand Australia Hawaii Bora Bora
somewhere that's kind of really far away
that would ordinarily be quite far to
get to but if it was a private plane and
someone offered us then we would
definitely go Amy asks what's your very
first luxury item that you bought love
you cutie very first luxury item I
bought was a mulberry bag it was I've
still got actually it was a dark brown
vegetable kind of leather mulberry bag I
think it's called the Roxette back and
it had like two big square pockets on
the front and had a big buckle on it and
I got it in the sale and at the time the
bag I think was about 600 pound it
definitely won't be six and you found
out but it wasn't itself like half-price
it's 300 pound
I remember being still excited about it
the fact that I was kind of buying my
first ever luxury piece I think I was
old was nine that's about 19 Olivia if
you could go back in time and change one
thing about your life big or small what
would it be that would definitely be
given up ballet I wish I'd never given
up dancing my suit at modern jazz point
ballet and I regretted it every day that
I ever gave it up I was pretty good at
dancing I loved it to bits it was such a
great where Keats's bit and I gave it up
because I ran out of time and yeah I
wish I've not Ellen asked what your
favorite kind of YouTube videos to watch
I would say fashion video
so anything similar to what I create
because I guess I make my videos because
I like watching much like other ones
like this so I guess a few people that I
think you should watch would include
totally obsessed with Meg and Ella be at
the moment I leave all the skills linked
down below by the way she totally follow
Meghan ellaby is such a baby she's from
Manchester I knew her from way back when
when both started vlogging she really
knows her stuff when it comes to fashion
and she's just anything Samara he's an
amazing friend of mine she's tall babe
she's gorgeous and again she knows a lot
about fashion she's going to a luxury
fashion and I know a lot of you guys
love luxury fashion so I helped her Sean
- I watched those two all the time and I
mean in terms of beauty I obviously look
like usual like Jaclyn hill money anyway
nikkietutorials clone Morello I also
love kind of people who do both fashion
and beauty like Suzy hello October who
again is a good friend of mine
Amelia Liana and she'll honestly you
should go fall mm she's a beautiful
person inside out she makes a really
great video she's very very
up-and-coming on YouTube and she
deserves a lot of love so Sarah what's
been your highlight in all those years
blogging because I recently hit my
four-year blogging anniversary so we're
in highlights oh my gosh there's been a
few meetups that I've done where I've
got to meet you guys those have been
major highlights so RT boys knows I've
done one with Karen Millen just kind of
like someone to stick to those kind of
fives as well but it's so good to meet
you guys kind of face to face that's
always incredible similar campaigns I've
got to work on with some incredible
brands like Burberry Dior coach Alam
you know the kind of brands that I
always aspired to and loved today it's
around uni it's about most of my life
and the fact that they got to work with
them on campaign use it's just
mind-blowing
I recently shot for a new L'Oreal TV
advert I mean that's insane
and also probably the biggest thing
would be that recently assigned as a
L'Oreal Paris hair and Buster if you
miss that video then you might have
missed that little note yeah so I
recently got signed by L'Oreal as a hair
ambassador for a year for them which is
a little bit insane and definitely the
biggest highlight ever if you weren't a
youtuber what you think you'd be doing
now I would
maybe marketing I would be fresh and
marketing hopefully for like a luxury
brand that was always my aspiration
after you thirsty if I don't do my PhD
that's probably why I would have kind of
gone and don't move to London I will try
to get myself into a brand I do it the
real work agency side I want it to work
for around and I was aspiring towards
kind of like this Porter I mean
obviously the dream would be you know
Dior Chanel Prada and he doesn't see my
mind to do something like that but then
this happened
join us from where do you get
inspiration for the next season's trends
is it from catwalks from other blogs for
this I say my inspiration I can I gather
from a lot of places so it comes to kind
of my new wardrobe I'll often buy
magazines like Vogue Elle Grazia those
kind of things and have a look through
what they are translating the new trends
as also it really helps I do go to all
the different Fashion Week shows so I
get to sort of see firsthand what's
gonna be on the next season's catwalks
so that always really helps to inspire
me so that then when I start seeing them
in the stores I'm like so look last
season this is a really lovely
interpretation perfect for my next
wardrobe buy even if you don't go to
shows like Vogue online l collections
magazine and I'll just show you
everything that you may have missed this
season before and that's really good to
kind of keep you up to speed but I also
look at my favorite bloggers see what
they're doing quite a lot of the
American bloggers I really love to look
at like Harvard Holly
chriselle lim else riddle of rosie in
dinners blog tomorrow's blog suzie
native fox those kind of blogs
everything to that fashion but also just
from Instagram to be honest I'll be
flicking through Instagram and see what
lots of other bloggers I'm Louisville
wearing and it totally despise me and
I'm like I could get something kind of
similar wear it my way completely make
this my style and kind of inspirations
like flows from that Ellie asks what's
your go-to song at the moment I think my
favorite song right now is a song called
till it's gone by Yelawolf
I mean Alex are all set with that album
it's a couple years old now but we're
watching the Sons of Anarchy which I've
just finished which by the way hi Lee
would you recommend so good and this
song came on it now and then we kind of
like what I would ever listen to yellow
will 404 and now that song is like the
song we cannot stop
- so till I'm gone by Yelawolf honestly
listen to it Gregg's ass what's been
your go-to foundation recently I've
actually had a few so things haven't
recommend right now I really really love
with me the hourglass Spanish stick
foundation if you're looking for more
mapped but flawless finished I also
really really love the NARS of tinted
tinted moisturizer in their kind of new
range i'll traveling the link down below
to the exact same exact one it is but it
just gives you the most incredible
cheery glow and a really beautiful color
of my skin tone but only wearing today
and the one I'm a little bit obsessed
with right now because it's so jewy and
so it's just wonderful coverage without
being too cakey
it's a L'Oreal cushion foundation it's
so great all I do is just take a sponge
and keep dabbing it in for foundation
dabbing it on and literally if I have
enough pound in my face it be so glowy
and it's still quite glowy and dewy now
but before it was just like oh my gosh
incredible honestly so good Ellen asks
what's your favorite drugstore makeup
round and that easily it would be
L'Oreal I said this before I kind of
feel L'Oreal it's a hybrid between high
street kind of drugstore and luxury
because the products are so brilliant
and so much goes into them and I feel
like the whole branding of L'Oreal is so
much more looks than it is drugstore but
I feel the are still a drugstore Brown
never I would say L'Oreal and Rose has
any goals you wish you've completed in
five years I have a lot of goals that I
would like to have completed I guess I'm
gonna so many opportunities these days
now for youtubers and bloggers which is
incredible and the inner likes of like
Christina Bassam being signed to L'Oreal
for her huge campaign it was like a huge
moment for bloggers so I'll so recently
the fact that I was signed as well to
L'Oreal was insane I'm not doing quite
as much as Christina is doing she's also
a huge campaign level she's almost like
a spokesmodel and that for me would be a
huge goal to kind of continue with
L'Oreal and be almost one of their kind
of spokesmodels but obviously a girl can
dream but let's talk about girls here we
can all dream I guess as well in five
years I would have liked to have kind of
gotten to a point with my body I feel
extremely confident every person has
their own hang-ups about their body and
fitness because I've been doing so much
travel
I haven't been working out the way I
really wanted to and therefore in a few
years time I really want to get to a
place where I feel really confident in
my routine with my fitness routines my
eating routine it's really healthy
really strong and that's where I want to
get to and also I guess it's quite quite
a lot of things really in five years I
really want my book to grow and that's
like my childhood grown and got so many
more incredible people watching just
growing my content in lots of different
ways and make it much more entertaining
you guys
you never know that mean there might be
something anchors launched in the future
which would be amazing weather that I
mean I'd love to know what you guys
would like to see from me what would you
like me to bring out would you like me
to bring out a clothing line or a beauty
liner I mean I'd love to know what you
guys think actually on that let me know
what you would like to see from me yeah
I'd like to have done quite a few
different things like that
Emily asked if you could have one bag
and a pair of shoes for the rest of your
life which would you choose if this is
only one bag when one pair of shoes rest
of my life I should probably choose some
flat shoes or else I'm gonna be pretty
uncomfortable
I believe this choose a pair of Converse
because they're so comfortable and we go
with most things a pair of like low top
converse would be perfect if not if it
was heels I can mix mother voice and
Valentino rocks herbs and for a bag I
probably if I could just choose one bags
rest of my life and we'll achieve is you
don't you have to go now just because it
kind of fits so much in there it's such
a robust bag it would probably last me
my entire life
and still look just amazing and so we
asked do you have any advice of keeping
fit which is funny after what I've seen
before about fitness but to balance my
main tips for keeping fit would be even
if you're not kind of feeling it I would
just literally get off and put on a gym
kit straight away okay bra you know just
get straight to your gym top put on some
leggings and a suit in those clothes
you're more likely to go to the gym also
I was find that if I'm in gym mode my
diet following so if I know I'm going to
gym a lot the chances of me going out
and buying cake are very slim because
I'll know how hard I've just worked and
I want to have a slob number thinking
it's not really worth that pain and has
put myself through for an hour so it
kind of the go come in hand
where else if I start missing the German
it goes with gym as much my eating slips
and I start eating all the pasta and all
the chocolate and all the sweets and you
know I found the two
really need to go side-by-side or I
don't do either so that would be our
biggest tip it would be to really get
one thing in order and then the other
one will follow quite quite nicely
hopefully and I'm going to leave it
there they were some really really great
questions quite fashionable UT related
which already kind of wanted so thank
you so much guys for asking me and asked
in the Frog question I love doing this
match day it was really really good fun
so yeah I might do another one really
really soon thank you for everyone who
asks me questions that really means a
lot I hope you can I've helped you learn
a little bit more about me and yeah
