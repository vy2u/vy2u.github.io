makeup preps so I started off with the
lush million dollar moisturizer it is
incredible for juhi skin and that is
exactly what I wanted so super agent and
I spot this all over the skin just put
in a little bit of some eyedrops just to
make sure my eyes did get irritated
during the day and then went in with
this incredible new YSL priming that
I've got it has looked like gold specks
in it so again more radiance here I'm
just mixing the Laura Mercier silk cream
in beige ivory with cream ivory and in
the Becca shimmering skin enhancer I
think that's what it's called
anyway absolutely beautiful again out of
going to this ultra radiant skin so
mixing these three together will provide
an amazing coverage and base because
Laura Mercier is incredible and the
Becca shimmering skin enhancer just adds
a little bit more of a glow here I'm
just using the Mac prep and prime and
light boost just to highlight underneath
my eyes and then I'm using cream Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and NCE no nw20 and
I'm using a real techniques sponge there
just to really dab all of that in to
make sure it stays on the skin but
really covers all of my dark circles and
any discolorations
okay my favorite lip balm ever the by
Terry Baume De Rose it's just so
beautiful and was prepping the lips with
that first of all here i'm using the
laura mercier translucent setting powder
with the Real Techniques NYX pick brush
think this is the duo fiber brush and
these not just to set all of that
concealer into place and make it perfect
and here I'm using the Anastasia Beverly
Hills contour palette in the powder
version and using my Mac large contour
brush just to contour that into my
cheekbones in the usual way I do I mean
a lot of this is very someone - how are
you - do my makeup just enhanced a
little bit so I'm just gonna with my
cheek colors there and around the side
of my temples just to make myself look
super bronzed
I'm touring contouring contouring and
again it's a little bit downside my nose
this is a tart brush I'm using a few
tart brushes in this tutorial and
they're so gorgeous like beautiful
grouping that in going over it with my
brush to make sure it's blended and then
here I'm using the hourglass lighting
palette oh it's just so beautiful this
is like the bronze II um and the
bronzing powder out there it's just so
gorgeous for adding even more glow I'm
just I think more a more glow as I go on
here's the Tom Ford bronzer in gold dust
again just for a bit more with golden
bronze all over the skin and to blend
everything in that I've done so far just
using the Real Techniques powered brush
for that and this highlight is so
gorgeous I mean can you see how much
that catch the light is just beautiful
and this is a Shishido trio enhancing
blush so you can use it as a blush as
well but I was little love it as a
highlight it's absolutely stunning
but even that with the zoeva fan brush I
think it's called I'm here I'm just
adding even more highlight with the
Kevin er Kwon candlelight highlight
again all the links will be down below
by the way my favorite blush of all time
the Charlotte Tilbury cheek swirl and
pop is it in first love it's so natural
it's just stunning it's perfect for my
skin tone I find
yeah I'm just prepping the eyes adding
some eyelid primer with the bomb eyelid
primer and here I'm using both on the
rack one and the wrap two pallets cuz as
you know I just love those using a zoeva
flat brush here just to Pat in the shade
beige I think it is from the lorac 2
palette
and here I'm using move which is from
the first lorac palette which is it's
quite a dull purple mode shape as the
name would suggest but it's perfect for
me I mean you know I love to use purples
and I've used this probably got a lot of
times a lot of times before but I do
love this just in the crease of my eyes
and here I'm just going back to the
lorac - and using the shame buff which I
usually always use on the Sigma e-40
brush and I really blend that into my
brow bone and just to make sure that all
of my eyeshadows blended down really
really well I'm just kind of going back
with both colors kind of build up the
shade making sure they're blended
perfectly I did this for quiet while
actually even though this massively sped
up I mean I think this play took me
about an hour and a half to be honest in
total because I was just gonna take my
time and chilling with it and here is
the Anastasia brow Wiz I think this is
in soft brown don't quote me it'll be
down below anyway but I just spent a bit
of time really working in and making
sure shape my brows was running and it
goes to all our little hairs were added
in and just a bit more affected
and plus because they have aspilia in
the red and you just keep pushing it
through and making it more and more
natural as you go but I do love a strong
brow so this is what I was going for
really and here I'm just using the
benefit speed brow just add a little bit
of gel to keep in place and then I
decided to use a gimme brow in the dark
color just at the very front of my brows
just add a little bit more definition to
them and then here I'm using the new
sticks in cream the new sixpence ol just
add a little bit of a lighter shade into
my waterline and here I'm using Mac
coffee eyeliner just to line my upper
lash line really working that into the
lashes and then I decided that I was
going to use this show I think it's
called chocolate from the lorac 2
palette and I'm using a tiny little
zoeva brush here just to wing for our
work over top of the coffee by Mac just
add a really sort of diffused and subtle
well some watts-russell Brown eyeliner
line I just didn't want a really harsh
black line for the wedding and it worked
so beautifully I really love the finish
and here's me finishing my second eye
and I'm also using a real techniques
brush there as well here are my favorite
lashes these are from mosquito I love so
many of their lashes I'll leave the
exact type down below of which I use
these a little bit bigger than the ones
I usually use because I fancied using
something a little larger and because I
was also doing my mom's makeup this day
and I've brought two pairs and I let her
have the smaller perks I knew she didn't
want anything too massive so I work for
these but I thought they were absolutely
beautiful just so enhancing really
natural kind of shape to them the
absolutely stunning
so I'm just working those into the
lashes using some tweezers as I always
do and she will wash glue
I remember the longer that you Meisel
glue to set on lashes we put them on you
will find this so much easier just let
it set a little bit more first here I'm
using Mac saw lip liner as always I just
love this as my liner before at war
nudes
over the top
and here I'm swinging the lips before
adding the hourglass nude shade onto the
lips and here I added a bit more of a
cocktail of lipstick so and then with
the Tom Ford nude form a little
something a little bit more nude and
then over the top again with the urban
decay lip gloss on the shades
I'll leave down below just to make sure
that I've got them all right for you
and that was that done so moving on to
hair I decided I want to have that the
center parting with some curls so I used
two GHD curl hole spray all over the
hair before then using the lee stafford
twisted curling one-nothing this is
called but it's by far probably my
favorite want to use it just really
volumizes each curl each one is totally
different so they're not uniform and
when you brush them out my hair just go
there's like boom as I love it so so
much so here's a bit of speed tutorial
and the way I'm wrapping it around the
wand and I'd twist it off that wand as
well because he can't just let the hair
slip off this because of the shape of it
so I split my hair into a center parting
which I don't usually do and I did all
of my hair as you can see is brand new
died so it's nice and perform atop going
down into a white where I look on brooch
and of so here just pushed it out with
my tangle teezer push the back of it
back to create a mess kind of crown it
back and I'm pulling two sides back and
using some little purple kirby grips to
hold each that in place and then I'm in
some hairspray so again I'm taking this
side I'm gonna use a tiny little kirby
grips and click that symmetrically at
the back and that was the hair finished
again a little bit more hairspray to
keep it in place and then I forgot that
he also had this beautiful little
hairband to wear so Alex just helped me
to put that into my hair and tie it in
with a little ribbon and that was from a
sauce again I'll leave the link down
below but it was so pretty
to finish with look at those eyelashes
oh so Renee
and Here I am just at the wedding
reception in my misguided dress
hopefully still help this I'll leave a
link down below if I could find it I'm
also wearing the most beautiful
Cinderella shoes from Jena shoes
encrusted with Swarovski crystals
they're just absolutely perfect and I'm
wearing a little at vintage styler
clutch bag and a beautiful little brace
that them among got me as well so leave
all links down below really put your
joyous guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
