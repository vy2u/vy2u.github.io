well I want to film a get ready with me
for a Christmas party look for you so
I'm way out now to a Clarence Christmas
party thought I'd film my look for you I
had an hour to spare so I've quickly
thrown this video together so I hope you
enjoy it it's very much about this
smokey eye big lashes and my neutral
nude lips it's very very Christmasy
colossi this look is made up of a lot of
new products as well so very new to me
and hopefully very new to you so
hopefully you'll find something that you
love in this tutorial yeah I really
really hope you enjoy watching it and
I'll see you soon okay so it's starting
off with a lush million dollar
moisturizer as always it's just the most
illuminating base and I love it moving
on to the gallon law primer which is
stunning it's got these little gold
particles in it and then for foundation
I'm trying out the new Giorgio Armani
maestro glow foundation which I adore
actually the finish of this is so
illuminating and brightening and
beautiful coverage here I'm just trying
out the Charlotte Tilbury mini miracle I
wand I've got the shade number one but I
think that the shade number two it would
be much much better it's more yellow
tone than this but still the coverage
was really lovely so one side is more of
a under-eye cream and then the other
side is the eye brightener so really
really like that and over the top I'm
just using the tarte concealer just fill
it with more coverage and to brighten up
my under eyes I'm just patting that in
with the Real Techniques Beauty sponge I
think we're moving into pallets and I've
started working with the lorac contour
palette which I'm loving so much so this
is the yellow highlight that I'm using
as my setting powder and then I'm gonna
use a light contour shade as my new
contour shade instead of my usual
Anastasia Beverly Hills but this is just
as good loving this so much actually
it's a really beautiful shadowy contour
shade and it works really really well
and I use the medium contour shade as
more of a bronzer so I'm using that on
the blush brush from Real Techniques
I'm just working it all over my neck and
everywhere else just to blend and then
move it into the shimmer highlight in
the same palette as a highlight and this
is beautiful it's so bright
it's more of a white powder than the
usual kind of rose gold I've been going
for recently and then moon into blush
this is the jyväskylä prism blush in
loon rose really beautiful shade
actually I loved using this I thought
the color was stunning
just using my usual dietary lip balm to
put the lips and then this is the lorac
mega 2 Pro palette and I'm absolutely in
love with it I got it from America
recently and I'm using the shade saw bag
on the crease of my eye cuz I love it
and I'm using a little bit of bisque as
well just to go over that and just to
kind of make a little bit more subtle
not quite it's dark so work those
together then use a blending brush to
blend that in at the very very top
before going in with peony which is more
of a rose gold champagne working that
all over the eyelid as I usually do this
is very similar to what I used to do
just with this new palette and to show
you the new prelate at work and then I'm
using Prosecco which is more of a
champagne silver into the very inner
corners of my eyes as I always do just
to brighten those up and then I'm taking
dark sienna which is a dark shimmery
Brown and that's going to the very outer
corner and under the lower lash line
just to make it much more smoky in a bit
more dramatic
okay moving on to brows I'm just
brushing through my very unruly brows at
the moment with the Giorgio Armani
spoolie and then I'm using to be bobby
brown eye definer brush as always with
the Giorgio Armani maestro brow gel
which is just my favorite I don't found
anything that's any better than this so
as you know this is what I always do and
then I finish off the brows with the
bodyshop brow and lash gel
I just find it works really well for me
here is the Givenchy eyeliner which is
when I favorites right now it's just got
a really great nib but it's just
fantastic
at creating that perfect cat eye so here
I am creating my cat eye in a couple of
seconds it's just pretty easy but this
pen it just kind of does all the work
for you I create the shape and I'll just
fill it all in
just curling my lashes when the Shu
Uemura eyelash curlers and as always
coating lashes in the Clarins
truly waterproof mascara I'm also going
to use lashes and the second which I
don't usually do these are these demure
lashes I think it's in dressed to kill
but I leave down below exact what it is
and this is six Kido lash glue which is
better than anything I've ever used in
fact Leasing little uses the other day
when we went to a party and they were
like this is amazing
so I'm just applying that with some
tweezers and then going over the edge of
the dishes on sheet eyeliner again just
to make it really perfect and then here
I'm using the Tom Ford lips and boys
lipstick
Cameron what shade is but again I'll
leave it down below it's super cute and
finishing off with the Galan lip gloss
which is absolutely beautiful these girl
and lip glosses I just rocking my world
recently I'm gonna do a full post on
soon and then this Chanel number 5 just
to finish off and make me smell lovely
just pushing through my hair cause it
was super unruly and honestly I didn't
have time to really do it so I just kind
of left it down as always
it's been quite difficult to show you
exactly what I'm wearing other than us
holding this camera like this my hair
I've just soft left as it is I really
hoped it would be more curly cuz I had
it more curled but I don't have enough
time to kill it now because let's
account it's outside so I'm wearing a
blue jumpsuit from three-floor I won't
mind she'll Beto Rossi court heels I
recently bought and I have my new Kenzo
silver clutch as well for a little bit
more cool I really quite like this
outfit it's quite tailored and quite
sophisticated but the blue is so it's
quite brush of bold and quite
Christmassy with the eye makeup and
that's everything I'm wearing thank you
