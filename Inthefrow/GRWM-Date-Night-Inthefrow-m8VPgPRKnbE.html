ready with me video I am out tonight on
a date night so I thought I'd show you
what I did to get ready from start to
finish I have done a really dark smoky
eye look with some really pretty plants
that go all the way around to my side
and in the side it's really different
style for me so I hope you like that
I've gone for some really lovely new
clothing from Lipsy as well and some
cute little H&amp;amp;M shoes so really really
hope you enjoy it if you would like to
get ready with me then please keep
watching okay so starting off with the
body shop drops of youth serum which is
wonderful as a base before applying the
regen moisturizer which as you know I
absolutely adore and use every single
day and then I'll apply the body shop
insta blue all over my cheeks on the top
of larger pore areas around my cheeks
down my nose and my forehead just to
cover and also work as a primer I'm
using the l'oreal true match in the
shade vanilla with the Real Techniques
buffing brush I'm just going to work
that all into the skin to really perfect
it and make it really really flawless
it's a really a foundation for that
really just have such excellent coverage
then I'm going to use the Mac prep and
prime in light boost such a beautiful
highlighter I would recommend using a
concealer as well though this just
worked a certain extent but I think a
little bit more concealer
really works well with it so I'm adding
your Estee Lauder it's almost like a
touch Eclair
cushy claw style pen so I'll leave all
the product links down below for you can
find everything that I'm using I'm also
using Real Techniques sponge that I just
dumped and with a bit of face mist and
I'm working that into the skin because
it just really perfects all types of
concealer it works into the skin so
beautifully it just makes a conceal I
pass the skin if use it with this sponge
okay so I'm just sitting all that with
the translucent setting powder from
Laura Mercier the Real Techniques duo
fiber brush as it just works so
perfectly just to add a really light
coating and dusting over the areas
concealed
just keep it all set in place all day
here I'm using a product I haven't used
in ages and it's the illamasqua cream
pigment in holo I'm just using that on
the Real Techniques 3:01 contour brush
adding it onto the hollows of my
cheekbones just to create a shadow
effect the more of a shadow that you can
create the more that your cheekbones
will look illuminated and much more
prominent on your face so can you create
a really natural shadow that is kind of
what you're aiming for with this now I'm
just gonna take a brand new pan of the
soap &amp;amp; Glory solar powder bronzer on a
real techniques powder brush working
that down the neck to make sure it's all
blended down and snow harsh lines
between my face and my neck
and then I'm going to take the Mac large
contour brush and work that again over
the hollow pigment just to deepen it up
add a little bit more bronze over my
forehead and down the side of my face as
well I'm using that down the sides of my
nose just add a little bit more contour
and I'll also blend that in a little bit
later too with my foundation brush here
I'm taking the nos multiple in
Copacabana I'm not using some ages and
it's so beautiful and lightening and
highlighting and that underneath my brow
bone and also to my cheekbones down the
center of my nose and also to the
Cupid's bow and I'll then go over the
top of that with a Kiko brush that I
have just to blend it all through into
the skin a little bit better and to make
sure there's no kind of lines of that
anymore on my face I'm just use my
foundation brush here just to make sure
I've since really nicely blended over
the cheeks then i'm using the do your
rosy glow blush which should probably
know is a favorite of a lot of people
it's so pretty it's off works with the
heat on your face as well apparently so
it just adds a really natural flush
then I'm going in with the hourglass
ambient lighting powder cuz I love just
to finish off with that sort of
highlighted bronze shade over all the
rest of side of my face then I'm taking
the Urban Decay vice palettes first time
I use this in a tutorial I've been dying
to use it and here I'm just using the
shade Bobby dazzle which it's a light
snow white shade into the very inner
corners then I'm using the shade undone
on the 200 Real Techniques brush which
is the really large eye shadow brush
working that into the crease and over
the lid and I'm just taking the Sigma
diffuse crease brush hair just to help
work that into the crease I'm using the
shade laughs in and just working that
into the very inner corners of the eye
just add a little bit more brightness
into the very inner corner and then I'm
taking the shade angel on another Real
Techniques eyeshadow brush and where can
that over lid again just to deepen that
up into more of a gray tone after a few
coats of that and then I did it defi
onto the same brush and work that into
the outer corner just so you create a
gradient from a light shade in the inner
corner to a dark shade on the outer
corner pretty easy but it does look
really pretty at the end with the edge
of the brush I'm just making sure that
that goes into a wing at the very edges
here I'm just taking its new Urban Decay
brush actually and I'm just taking the
very flat end to go underneath my lower
lash line and just shade that out taking
that same white shade from before I'm
using a large Sigma brush this is the
e-40 and I'm using it just to really
blend in all of those shades together
while it's also adding some highlight
shades my brow bone then I'm just taking
the Real Techniques 201 brush and
working back with the revolver darkest
revolver shade it's like a black and
working that into the outer corners over
the top of those two shades that we've
added working it underneath the lower
lash line as well so it all blends
together and working it over the very
top through all of the crease just cuts
the crease and creates a lovely gradient
again from the dark shade into the last
shade then I thought I would add this as
an eyeliner as well because I really
like powder eyeliners it does make
everything a little bit more sultry and
subtle some using the zoeva liner brush
here that I have dampened so it picked
up the product much much easier and then
adding that over the top in an eyeliner
shape really flick that out into a
beautiful feline flick and filling in
any more product after all that supplied
I went back in with a real techniques
201 and just made sure that those
sections are connected so the eyeliner
connects into the rest of the wing of
the eyeshadow it just really helps to
blend all out and just makes it look a
little bit more fluid so then I'm gonna
use Sigma e-40 once again and just make
sure that's all blended perfectly
it's gonna do the same on the other eye
as you can see again I've just lined
underneath my lash line working that
right up into the cat I flick and work
that down over my upper lash line as
well here I use my favorite anastasia
dipbrow in the shade soft brown with the
Bowie Brown eye definer brush which
again you've Polly seen this millions of
times to do my brows but I just fill in
the front work the shade underneath the
brow to create the overall shape and
then it was fill in all those little
hairs to create the overall tail at the
end
to make sure it's all set in place all
day I just use the HD brow wax you could
do anything the ones from Photoshop
spray and decay to a good one just make
sure that your eyebrows stay set in that
place all day and I'll just take away
any excess product as well okay moving
on to eyeliner I'm using the Lord and
berry black eyeliner
it just works really really well but
there's so many you could use I'm sure
you've got your own eyeliner so just
work that into the upper lash line and a
lower lash line it's a really smoky
sultry style my trusty Schumer eyelash
curlers as always curl those lashes and
then I'll apply some the Clarins
waterproof mascara which is just the
only thing I can use for my really
straight lashes as it holds a curl so
nicely and then for the lower lashes I'm
just going to apply the L'Oreal
telescopic so just find it separates
them really really well and then last
but not least my favorite lipstick the
YSL rouge developed nude beige number
one shade the most beautiful nude pink
and it just works so beautifully with a
smoky eye and that is a whole look
finished
so moving on to the hair today I fancy
doing a bit of a Platt down the very
front of my hair I used to have this
style so much say five years ago six
years ago it used to do it all the time
and I realized the other day I haven't
done it for ages so I fancy cutting at
the very front so here I'm just doing a
French plat all the way down the very
front of my hair taking pieces from each
side if you know how to French plat then
brilliant you'll be fine at this but if
not it's just like creating an ordinary
plat but working more hair into each
strand before you cross it underneath
the next one so it's quite hard to show
you but just creating a platting more
hair into each strand as you go so here
I'm going to pick up some more hair as
you can see I'm going to work that into
the plat before I then apply more hair
into the next round and work it
underneath not very good at explaining
my split me it's quite complicated but
when you get the knack you'll get the
knack it's just it can be quite a double
when you know how to do it but it just
looks really pretty working down the
front of your face like this just frames
the side of your face really beautifully
I'm listing that a little bit further
down working it into a plat and then
finally I'll just start forgetting the
rest of the hair and it's working these
three pieces into a full plat she all
the way down to the very tip of the
plant
after you've done that all the way down
you're just gonna secure that with any
kind of bubble really I'm just using a
see-through bubble here but we will
change this slightly in a second I'm
pushing that Nixon side of my hair and
just attaching it with a Kirby grip as
otherwise to Platt that sort of weight
of the plaque and pull away from the
side of your face and you don't want
that so then I'm going to curl dress my
hair so it looks really pretty I'm using
my usual lee stafford twisted styling
wand you'll see this so many times it
just makes the cutest curls
especially when they brush out I'm doing
this all over my hair just watch back
through all the tutorials to find how I
do this and much more depth but I just
sort of giving you a little sneak
preview of it here but I'm doing all of
my hair in two layers on one side and
then I'm gonna go into the other side my
hair underneath the plat moving to put
out the way and just curling all of that
very mind with this crystal curling wand
you have to almost uncurl the hair off
it it doesn't slip off because of the
shape of the wand so moving out all to
the side and then I decided that I was
going to only have the plat halfway down
my head so here I'm just securing that
with a see-through pin I've one done the
plat and then I'm going to curl those
pieces of hair and I thought it would
look prettier with the entirety of the
hair curls so then I went into my
bedroom to get dressed and I realized
that I would rather have this section
here also plat it so all I've done is
taken a little piece of hair and plaited
it super easy not French part just a
normal plat halfway down the hair just
securing that again with a see-through
band you can finally set Claire's
accessories and everywhere really and
then securing that to the back of the
hair with another little Kirby grip it
does make sure that all that side of the
hair doesn't then start falling out and
here's my outfit
