Scottish Fashion Awards which is
sponsored by Olympus the awards are by
the way not this video so this is gonna
be a hopefully quite quick get ready
with me video because I'm running out of
time somewhat I'm just playing the lush
million dollar moisturizer all over my
face but ultra glow putting more light
into the face with the Becca shimmering
skin hunts looser I'm going to take a
little bit of the wire sound blur primer
I'm gonna put that just here around when
my pores are the biggest around my nose
and on the nose I'm much it I'm going to
be using the Mac Pro Longwear and NC 35
which is really quite dark
I'm just tan though I'm going to use the
Illamasqua skin base in 4.5 I do have
5.5 as well but I almost want to kind of
lighten this up but still get the
consistency of this this is going to put
a little pump of the shimmer into there
to mix those around and I'm going to use
my zoeva defined buffer just this hour
little bit first
then I almost kind of pat buff it into
the skin so I just want a really
flawless coverage for this because I've
really patted that into the skin rather
than really working it around the skin
it's really high coverage I'm just going
to go in with my Mac Pro Longwear in NC
20 and then my Mac Glide boost
okay powder I'm going to use the
illamasqua press powder legatees and my
Real Techniques jewels our brush brush
that over wind arise just my t-zone I
swear this video is not sponsored by
Illamasqua I'm just really into their
products again at the moment and this is
their sculpting palette I'm going to
take this one which is heroin and I saw
which is Nimbus and kind of mix the two
together to get a really gray Brown
shadow a shade for my and then this is
the Louise young swag one
then I'm going to take this more yellowy
white powder here in the palette and I'm
just gonna not underneath here
just on forehead in the middle and
obviously I'm going to use the Becca
Jacqueline Hill champagne pop
and bronze up with the Tom Ford bronzer
note down the neck I almost like to go
over everywhere that just stop contour
just give it a bit more of a blending
the bronzer and for blush I want to go
for something really more peachy so I'm
gonna go for the Tarte captivating blush
I'm just going to use a Clinique
Moisture Surge face break just going to
sit all down right the exciting part is
the eyes I go for like a gold rose gold
flash quite a bright gold eye I'm going
to go for mixture of naked and the
tomforde
golden peach cream eyeshadow which is
insanely gorgeous and use this looks
petit crease brush which are you have to
use for this you can use this with your
hands as well but I'm going to try the
brush first
okay let's move into the Naked palette
I'm going to go for sin right here into
the inner corner with naked right here I
do this is our crease shade today
it's going to take a bit verging on a
variant err on the Big E Sigma e-40
brush I'm just going to blend that now
on the top into the brow bone okay and
now I'm just going to take half-baked
which is the golden shade I'm gonna pack
that on the lid
I'm just going to add a little bit of
book which is a darkest brown to to warm
this off a little bit
we're going to run that book underneath
the lash line
now the top of that and can add a little
bit the half-baked
then we're going to take the very top of
the Tom Ford just like this I'm just
going to literally use my finger to dab
all through there and just put that on
I'm just going to wet my it's a weaver
winged liner brush and look is there my
scissors and I'm just going to dip it
into a mixture of creeps of black and
also dark horse just to kind of get a
brownie brownie black line in case I
don't want any fallout right now
okay guys so this is where my microphone
decided to die and didn't tell me that
it had a completely run out of battery
so from now on I'll just have to do a
voiceover but everything else that I did
so let's just continue I'm just taking
the Jojo Armani eye brow maestro in
wedge think it is running that through
my brows
I'm just taking the I love brown gel
think and are sitting or mat in place
and brushing it through Shu Uemura
eyelash curlers and some chlorines
through the waterproofing SCARA and in
my favorite excluder lashes and I'll
here choosing between oh so sweet and
the BFF brushes and I apply those with
the Aikido glue which is incredible as
well as this ardell lashes locator it
will gadget it's so brilliant it's the
best thing I've ever used replying
lashes this is foolproof so then I'm
going on to using Mac will I believe
then the hourglass nude lipstick which I
adore and then just to blend the two so
it's a bit more ombre I went back with
the same lip liner from Mac and just
went all the way around the edges to
kind of blend the two together and then
here I'm using a Urban Decay lip gloss
which I'll leave the color below I'm
finishing off with some muck coffee
liner and wood
so then it was on to my outfit and I was
choosing between this gold sequin number
as well as a self-portrait blue dress
and as you can see here I decided to
scale at the goal just because I loved
how it worked with the golden eyeshadow
that I've done and it's just a little
bit more sleek and sexy and I also
decided to go with a very put-together
sleek pony to pull to one side and
attach together with a see-through
ground and all I did was just back home
a little bit at the roots just to add a
little bit more real life and applied a
bit of hairspray
just keep everything in place just so
simple but just looks a little bit more
pulled together
and Here I am right before I leave Alex
wasn't at least shots for me in the
dress such a high split but I just
thought it looked so gorgeous
and I put it with this Chloe bag Pandora
earrings beautiful rose gold Pandora
earrings and bracelet as well as my
figure Louboutin heels there we go thank
you so much for watching guys see you
