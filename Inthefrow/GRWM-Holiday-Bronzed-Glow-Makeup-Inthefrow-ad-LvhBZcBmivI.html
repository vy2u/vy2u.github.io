bronzed and contoured summer evening
makeup look I'm going to start off this
look with a Lancome energy TV range
which is a beautiful hydrating
moisturizer that is to really create a
wonderful base and then I'm moving
straight into the chemin aqua and
celestial liquid light just to kind of
add that hydrated radiant boost to my
skin then I'm going to go into the road
your skin tint and I use a shade number
two with this foundation brush which I'm
absolutely in love with I cannot
recommend this any more
it's so fantastic it just really helped
to disperse the product all over the
skin what's really buffing it in I've
totally fallen for this brush now I
forgot to bring a sponge with me on this
holiday so this was my Savior then I'm
moving into the rodeo concealer I have
shade one and shade too I'm starting off
with shade one just to help conceal and
brighten the under eyes and the in a
corner and over the eyelid as well just
to create a really kind of perfected
base and then I'll move into shade
number two which always help to warm up
the under eyes again and I'll also use a
shade just to go over any blemishes or
any other areas of my face at need a
little more touching up and to set all
of that I'm going to use the road or
banana powder which is my favorite new
powder for setting all the makeup I just
applied Chloe's underneath the eyes over
the nose over the forehead it's just
really wonderful to illuminate and
brighten all of the skin and the next
powder is a road your contour powder I
don't if you've seen this before but it
is one of the best contour powders on
the market it has the most wonderful
gray Brown tone which makes it so
wonderful for the contours of the cheeks
just look at that really natural
enhanced look to the cheekbones and I'm
just using that here with the rodeo
sculpting brush which is great for
getting into the hollows of the cheek
bones and was working it onto the
cheekbones and then up to the sides of
my temple
and I need to do from here is blend
blend and blend and for bronzer this is
the new limited edition Clarins summer
palette we always come out with the most
beautiful bronzers for summer so I could
not wait to use this it has a really
gorgeous kind of coral tone and you can
use the coral shade in the very center
just to use that as a blush as well so
it's really beautiful color couldn't
wait to use this so I'm just going to
over the top of the contour just kind of
bronze it up a little bit more down the
fan my temples over my forehead I just
want a really bronze goddess look these
are the gallon meteorites pearls so
gorgeous I'm just using them just to go
over other areas of my cheeks I just
want to kind of illuminate highlight
lighten and just set as well oh my gosh
this highlighter is so beautiful it's a
brand new one from Illamasqua
I'll leave all details below to all the
products by the way here that summer
holiday glow this is the perfect
highlighter and then I'm going to move
into rodeo blusher in South Beach a
really pretty pink very much my kind of
color and just adds a little closure I
think this new eye pencil from Bobbi
Brown is one of my new life savers is in
the shade taupe all I do is add it all
over the eyelids draw on super easy I'm
just going to blend all of that in with
the road you'll sculpt brush this is a
really great blending brush and
literally a blend blend blend blend it
out into the crease blend it a little
bit further up towards the brow bone
it's one of those very easy one looks
like one easy finish but it's really
effective I'm so obsessed with this at
the moment
and here I'm just using this smudge
brush from Rodeo to use that underneath
the eyes and smudge it all the way along
my lower lash line
no joke 25 minutes later after I finish
my entire makeup look I realize that my
camera had died I was so upset about it
but I thought let's just kind of
continue and I'll show exactly what I
did so I just took my illamasqua powder
and work that into the inner corner of
the eyes and over the cube exposed for a
little bit more highlight then I went in
with the Giorgio Armani brow and I
maestro and the Giorgio Armani spoolie
brush and worked into my eyebrows you
please see me do this so many times
before I just fill the man shape them
makes them really nice and pointed and
quite sculpted brush through them with
the spoolie and just set those in place
I'm going to use the illamasqua brow
build it's like a new gel they've come
out with you can just brush it through
the brows as a look at my product and
also will keep them set all day it's a
really really great product so I'm just
using that here just to make them all
perfected and I'm going to use one of my
favorite eyeliners this is the ICO I do
liner I'm just using very small little
wings just to enhance the eyes we're not
add anything overly dramatic then I'll
just use my eyelash curlers as the pump
up my allit is a little bit more give
them a little bit more curl and then I'm
going to go in with the rodeo glamor
lash skinny mascara which was a really
great mascara it just really helped to
separate elongate my lashes created a
much more dramatic finish to my eyes
overall and I added into the bottom
lashes as well and the back to where my
camera across out alias so I can have
the lips and I'm using the XXL lipliner
in baby this is a wonderful color
stomates my kind of color kind of a
nudey pink it draws on really easily and
beautifully and you also fill in the
lips with this as well if you like but
I'm going to use one of the new you a
lip colors so this is the G way lip
cream in a dulce de leche I hope have
said that right
it's a gorgeous taupe nude pink very
helped Kylie Jenner very much they're
going to shade I am loving to bits right
now so I'm applying that all over the
lips but then I decided to add more of a
bronzed glow to central lips so I'm
adding the Shu
whip cream in Pamplemousse dabbing that
into the center of the lips and then
just blending it in just for a bit of a
glow a bit of illumination to the very
center of the lips all to finish and to
set everything in place I'm using the
new Clarence sticks makeup which is
become my new favorite settle spray
really hydrating and it smells beautiful
so that is the finished look very bronze
contoured highlighted it's my kind of
girl to look at the moment so I'm really
hope you like it
Amin lights are going out for a really
lovely meal this evening so I wore my
self portrait dress with my Chloe
messenger bag in this beautiful town
with the tassels I just love the colors
it's so cute
and I paired those with a new pair of
jean vita Ruffy sandals in this lovely
rich forest khaki green I love the way
the straps got the legs very kind of
ballerina style this self portrait dress
is such a winner though it works with so
many more can special occasions events
date nights it's still beautiful all
that I can cut out work and I also wore
my Dior sunglasses just to keep the last
of the sunset out of my eyes and to
finish just because it gets a little
more breezy in Santorini tonight I
paired it with my Valmont blazer in the
black just to add more restricted finish
to a final look really really hope you
liked this guide thank you so much for
watching I will see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
