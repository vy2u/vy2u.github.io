with me with my hair starting off with a
new launch L'Oreal Paris the lo shampoo
cleansing cream lotion shampoo is a no
foam no friction no sulfate formula it's
really gentle on the hair and it's so
perfect for anyone with colored or
bleached hair as it really helps to
resist fading from general washing and
also helps kind of protect fragile and
damaged hair types because this has oils
inside it and it's really nourishing you
literally only need this one product to
wash your hair so it feels a little bit
like a shampoo conditioner formula when
you put it on feel super soft super
silky and literally just use this one
product so it's perfect for me while I'm
away it really helps to speed up my
whole hair washing process okay so I'm
going to let my hair air dry in the
sunshine once I do my makeup starting
off with the Armani premier my stress
inhalation this is really glowy
wonderful moisturizer it really sinks in
beautifully and works so well with
makeup so I really love it for that
reason the Urban Decay flawless
foundation I've ridden getting into this
I do find it oxidizes a tad so be
careful about that when you're choosing
a color but overall it just give him
really flawless finish to the skin it
doesn't feel too heavy either so I just
really enjoyed using this on my holiday
and I'm working out in with a Beauty
Blender so it's a little bit more
flawless on the skin to begin concealing
I'm going to use the Bobbi Brown
corrector in light peach again on the
Beauty Blender I'm just going to work
this onto my darker circles under my
eyes it's a color correct then a little
bit before I go in with the Kat Von D
lock-it concealer which is my current
favorite it's really flawless it's quite
a heavy formula without being too cakey
but I find that when I work it in with
the Beauty Blender it just gives a
really bright and hydrated flawless
finish underneath the eyes I also like
Twitter down the side the nose and on to
my chin just so I'm perfecting
everything on my face and now I'm just
going to use the rodeo setting powder in
the translucent shades for a bit of
powder but too bright so probably didn't
even need it my skin is so dry right now
in moving on to the Burberry contour pen
this is I could contour for dummies as
I've mentioned before I just used a very
packed brush this is the Louise Young
l15 one brush I'm just working out in
and blending that into my contours size
of my temples and I also like to draw it
down sides of my nose to give myself a
bit of a nose contour as well but it's
so quick it's really easy it's a lovely
stony tan Brown so it's just a great
kind of bronze but stone based shade
really it works really really nicely and
one of my favorites the bronze goddess
by Estee Lauder this is just a really
great tanned bronzing shade I wanted to
really bronze goddess look for this so
what better than the bronze goddess
palette right so this is the new shimmer
shot from Tom Ford which I'm totally
obsessed with it's just a gorgeous
highlight I also like to use it with
moisturizer I like to mix it for the
foundation but here I'm just using it on
the Anastasia Beverly Hills highlight
brush and worked out onto the top of my
cheekbones a bit more of a Juhi
highlight finish and then working the
L'Oreal True Match highlight thinks this
one in the row shades I adore this as a
blush and as a highlight so I'm just
using the two together adding the more
whiter creamy shade to the top of my
cheekbones and a light pink to my apples
of my cheeks it's so pretty
for the eyes this is the bytearray ombre
blackstar it's a writing pinky champagne
e shade bit more pink than the champagne
tones but it's thought it'd be a very
pretty pink look to go with the pink
cheeks as well
and I'm just going back to that same
true match palette now taking the white
shade from this and work this into the
very inner corners just to brighten them
up just use my Schumer at eyelash
curlers just to pump up my lashes a tad
although they are still quite curled for
my LVL lash lift and I'll say and one of
my absolute favorite mascara so L'Oreal
false lash sculpt mascara it is so
really in this mascara it just really
opens up my eyes separates lengthens
adds a bit of volume I also found the
color doesn't transfer to your under
eyes as well which I often suffered with
under eye mascara so that is a bonus so
I'm just adding that to my upper and
lower lashes with a couple of coats
moving into the anastasia beverly hills
dipbrow in chocolate i'm a tad obsessed
for this again as soon as you buy a new
part of this it just kind of comes back
to life again so I'm just using my
Armani brush just to work that into my
brows nothing too heavy I always say
that but you know I like my darker brows
and then I'm just going to set that with
the new Tom Ford brow gel I just find
this it literally sets your brows all
day they are not moving after you have
used this so I use these two in
conjunction and just a love that this is
the Kevin Kwan medium lip pencil it's
like your lips but better look so I'm
just going to fill in my lips and also
draw out my lip shape just to kind of
make it a little bit more plump and
round and finishing off this whole look
with the gold obsession L'Oreal Paris in
beige nude which is my favorite color
from a range
it's a beautiful beige with an undertone
of gold sparkles and just looks dreamy
and bronzy and glowy and that's the
whole look you the poses this is how it
all looks that highlight is so pretty
and we have to dress options to have a
keepsake dress in a lavender blue shade
it's got a handkerchief hem lots of
movement beautiful drape edge and I just
paired that with a Bulgari 70 forever
band just kind of set off the blue tones
and the second option is this gorgeous
self-portrait dress in the turquoise and
dark navy floral lace the Gucci velvet
Marmont bag and just some finished
sunglasses and my hair I just tied into
a half-up half-down ponytails to keep it
off my face so which is your favorite
outfit let me know down below in the
comments and in collaboration with
L'Oreal Paris and give it away 250 of
the low shampoo bottles so make sure you
