changing that in a minute I am currently
in Harrogate which is near New York I'm
here for my mum's hen party we're having
a really cute classy hen party doing
that afternoon tea and I mean the best
meal I thought I'd kind of do a bit this
summer
boho chilled outlook because the play
suit and wearing later is quite kind of
chilled out and hearty style and quite
boho so I thought I'd kind of go with my
makeup tutorial I'm not doing tutorial
and aegis I'm going to do a full get
ready with me and this time I'm usually
always do my makeup first in my hair but
I thought today my hair's really knowing
me today it's just a bit unruly I'm
gonna do my hair first because I want to
kind of get that both her look I'm from
a festival cool style I'm gonna start
with this little tool this is genius if
you want to get those really cute little
twists and turns and braids and things
this is from a brand called sketchy and
it's 30 pounds buy in the stores I'll
leave links below where you can get it
and whatnot but I thought it's really
cool how it's battery powered easy to
take to festivals beaches or things we
totally can do your friends hair your
hair it's really really cool so I
thought I'd bring it with me to get this
look so I do is take this pack that you
want dr. braid lifts it into into equal
portions that's not equal nope my hair
is so look how long my hair is and it's
ridiculous so this has two little
buttons on the side but you push up this
and so you put your hair underneath
first one locks in place
get the second piece of hair again make
sure it's nice and sort of combs through
what's in the second piece it's about
right and then just push it up the first
button then you push the button down and
it whines it really sorry about the way
if the lighting is really really really
bad boys because I don't have any lights
with another six I'm gonna hotel room so
I'm just in front of the window thanks
so
and secure that again we have a clip so
this little tool just kind of takes out
any kind of hard work making little
braids so it's quite quick and easy and
simple so now later on I'll let's go tie
this back and I think what I might do is
kind of wrap them around and create like
a little bun shape with them
and then I'm just going to I'm gonna
kill these I'm just gonna use a generic
curler kill these can't be right back
okay so hair done I'm just giving it a
lovely little curl it's all these fits
occurred it's gonna make a start with
the blush million dollar at moisturizer
it's always just clothes absolutely
beautiful it smells gorgeous and it
gives you a beautiful do you finish okay
next thing the Mac strobe cream this is
really great actually
it's like a white cream and when you put
it on it just kind of helps to leave the
skin really flawless makes it super jewy
and illuminated this skin looks so
radiant
moving on to Foundation and I'm gonna go
for two that I'm really liking at the
moment this is the Clarins everlasting
foundation plus SBS 15 SPF 15 and this
is the Laura Mercier sort cream in cream
ivory and I mix the two together and I'm
going to use the zoeva definer author
brush to start with not into skin
down on it
next thing I'm gonna go in with the
Bobby Brown perfection corrective
brother in light peach
adding that beneath the eyes first of
all does it kind of correct a bit that
rednecks like I haven't slept a lot
recently
me doing so much traveling and I haven't
really caught up from the kind of sleep
I've lost from it yet okay this one's
gonna pack that all in
next up or a Messier translator the
translucent powder and I'm just gonna
put that underneath there does it set
that concealer doesn't go anywhere okay
next up we're gonna do a little bit of a
chiseling so I'm gonna use the road I'll
Instagram compact deluxe contouring
powder at number three it's a really
fantastic shadowy brown shade it's not
tanned it's more of a shadowy Brown
which is what your contour is meant to
be just using the Mac large contour
brush just brushing up into the hollows
of my cheeks
and then I'm just gonna use the Tom
thought bronzer this is in the shade
gold dust I'm going to use my large
contour brush from Real Techniques as
well
I'm gonna brush this down the neck first
those hollows again just add a little
bit more color back into the face I'm
gonna look really washed out on here so
honestly in real life I'm a little bit
dark than this camera is giving me
credit for eat bill technics blush brush
just to really go over those okay for
blush I'm gonna go with my favorite the
moment it's a clinic pink pop blush I'm
just going to use that with a zoeva
cheek brush sweep a little bit over
there very like this it's so pretty this
it's such a summery pink and with it
being a cream as well it just gives it
much more of a natural she doesn't make
your cheeks look really powdery
next up gonna go with highlight this is
a Kevin a Kwan so I still powder in
candlelight how beautiful and the loving
this at the moment so Eve at looks fan
brush just Fanning it over there and
cheeks
a little bit of my actual cheek scissor
and just run it onto the brow bone and
here okay next up is lip balm just a
hide a little bit without recording a
little bit more just a by Terry Baume De
Rose in rosy babe
next up I've been dying to use this
after I showed it in the new in beauty
video that I did it's the the bomb rock
star palette that's going to go in with
a dash 0 here this cream oh gosh that's
gonna brush that into my brother
and kind of all over the lid just to
give it a really even creamy base float
I blended right here a rosy pinky
champagne I'm going to add that into my
inner corners then when I use this Iron
Maiden
I made an eye on these Zoe Weaver looks
classic shader brush which is a
beautiful flat brush and now I need to
wash my brushes guys I've been away on
three holidays and I'm desperate to do
it have to have no time but like
literally no time at all
I'm sorry adding that packing it kind of
onto the lid the mobile lid can hear all
your the girls near the room opening the
champagne I am late as always I'm going
to use a Mac 207 and I'm going to use
Allegro this brownie shade use that
increase
the pigmentation this is so lovely I'm
they blend so beautifully like
and if you want to use go back and use a
larger fluffy brush just to help shade
that in the top as well okay if it's not
a little bit harsh use these are Weaver
looks soft define a brush and I'm gonna
use a little bit of moderato here as a
purpley shade Oh Alice cough looks
pretty my puppet that over the top let's
see okay so moderato into this outer
corner pretty shade it's good back into
my Mac c17 to help pull up if it's a
little bit thinner just gonna pack on a
little bit deep in that corner
helped from really pretty ready purple
and I'm gonna add that over the top
I love that all of that lot that is so
pretty
I've recently bought this this is one of
the mood sticks in cream
I bought it to kind of go in their
corners but it will also work just as
nicely underneath the eyebrows and was
going out a little bit and blend in
I'm also gonna do I think is around my
okay so brailles I'm gonna use my
illamasqua precision brow gel in or
colorless and the bobbi brown eye
definer brush
I need to go and get and died really
since I'm so sick of drawing them here
okay may have been a bit overzealous
with the brow gel it's gonna brush that
through just to really soften up back up
again and this is just the HD brows gel
it's not like an absolute favorite there
are so many things that do the same job
but this is just the one I'm on at the
moment okay I'm in two minds whether to
do a liner or not because it is so
strong I think I might just go with
mascara so I'm gonna curl and I'm gonna
use my absolute favorite Lancome doll
eyes Hypnose mascara all I'm gonna do is
use an eyeliner use a Tom Ford eyeliner
to go along with very very finely along
the lashes as Mitch I roll away the
black
like a line it's barely there but we'll
just really help to stop really in
handsome I'm gonna use my new favorite
MAC lipstick real doll gorgeous pink
just to mute that down I'm just gonna
add a little bit of the Tom Ford nude
for Neil 12 and that is the makeup done
except I'm wearing a new play suit from
motel I thought so Q and quite again
