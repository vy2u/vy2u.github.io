ready with me video I know I'm filming a
lot of these recently but I know that a
lot of you seem to really really like my
get ready with me and I also like to
film them so I thought I'd put one
together for London Fashion Week a lot
of you have been chatting to me on my
Instagram about how much you're enjoying
seeing on the footage kind of behind the
scenes and whatnot so I thought I'd
bring you along for actual getting ready
for an actual day of Fashion Week so
I've gone for an almost a roasted red
lip and with some beautiful shot till
the lipsticks and I've killed my hair
and these lovely beachy loose curls I
really really love I much prefer these
looser and natural curls so I've done
that with my new new me barrel cola
which is fantastic so I'm going to show
you how I use that and that's it so if
you'd like to get rid of me fall under
fashion week then please keep watching
okay so I'm gonna go in with the drops
for use from body shop as far as my face
just as a base layer so ultra hydration
and then I'm just gonna use the
Elizabeth Arden skin balancing lotion
I'm also gonna use Charlotte Tilbury
wonder glow primer soft focus beauty
balm thing again just for a little bit
more illumination and also it's a really
good primer foundation I'm gonna try and
use what's left of my NARS sheer glow
but don't think this looks oh oh I mean
look I am in the look okay so I've also
just added in some of the Clarins
instant light as well makes me with an
ashy glow on the Real Techniques buffing
brush I'm just working out into my skin
really look trying to blend that in my
skin is really tired and dry recently
so it's not looking at the best admit
okay so on to concealer I'm going to use
a bit of the collection lasting
perfection concealer it's not one my
favorites I'll be honest but it's quite
lightening so I'm just going to use that
triangular shape with my eyes I run out
of my usual Mac and prime you're going
to also use Clarins and some concealer
that I use all the time I know but it is
just so brilliant it's a perfect shade
for me and great coverage we're ready
already
so okay doesn't think sponge I'm going
to use this vitamin C energizing mist
from the body shop because my usual
vitamin E face mist has run out
I'd highly recommend using the vitamin E
face myths from the body shop for this
I'm just adding some extra product
that's still on my sponge and it delves
into my nose and across my forehead as
well
such that the arm placement is going to
use the laura mercier this is a
translucent press setting powder and my
usual Real Techniques duo fibre brush
that you can find in the next pics
collection as far as really disperse
this product really lovely without
getting too clumpy or heavy on the skin
I'm just setting that exactly where I
put it
nowhere else
we move on to bronzer so I'm going to
use the Estee Lauder from God s powder
on a big Real Techniques powder brush
I'm going to work that into the neck on
to decolletage and forehead side before
had to sweep that on and then a little
bit across the middle mainly two sides
bring that down the face and onto
hollows down so I'm just gonna use the
Charlotte's Hillberry bronze &amp;amp; Glow
palette and my Mac a large contour brush
and we're going to
and then after work up over the cheeks
just almost fade it upwards from there
and then up the side of the face and
then you bring that down round just
underneath the jawline
and then I've also taken recently we're
just using flattening the brush
nothingís you're ruining it I really
get down both sides of my nose
well next step as always let's just my
everyday routine pretty much our boss
ambient lighting powder and radiant
light on the end I think is and we're
going to sweep that really gently over
all of that good stuff a little bit of a
glow and my favorite highlighter is this
one in the middle you don't know really
know what to put highlight always look
up to I and just add it to the bit
already have light touching it just to
enhance that natural light
I'm going to use max Lord to love pretty
peachy gingery tone blush
okay I'm going to use the lorac -
palette
after much deliberation that's the one
I'm gonna go with so to start off with
I'm gonna use these two in this corner
both and snow witch that you lightest on
the cream and a white and I'm gonna take
that on a sigma e40 a like nice big
brush and I'm just working that into the
eye brow bone
it all seems a little bit of beige as
well in there cuz that's really
pigmented take a little bit of snow and
beige but a lot of you might not have
the lorac - palette or the little
palette for any colors or shades that
you have a similar just use those not
saying you should have to get this any
champagne colors or light colors as you
know I always add a champagne you like
all that into the inner corner just it
helps open up my eyes let's find it
works a nice that's what I do then I'm
just gonna take nectar this almost
peachy toned very light brown on a Mac
two one seven I'm gonna add that into my
crease
and I'm actually gonna take a lot of
that over led to really like this needs
a bit of next up with the brown and just
run that under this level lash line so
you can wind up together those two
inside as per usual I'm taking my
Anastasia brow dip brow in soft brown
and my hubby Brown my usual routine
start the bottom compute the shape of
the bottom of the brow throat the tail
then go back and fill in a few gaps
on a heavy brow I like it
buddy sharp brow and mush gel I found it
last time I did a tutorial I could not
find this bad boy but it was hiding just
gonna prep the lips with the by Terry
Baume De Rose right Aiko I do eyeliner
best thing ever
for me at the moment
she Mirage colas
when did the lower lash line as well I
wouldn't say as well this is the Clarins
truly waterproof mascara
which is my favorite as you will know
quite liked the idea of using this one
from Charlotte Tilbury Bond girl maybe
mix with a bit of Glastonbury which is a
pretty dark honey got a shop lip brush
start off with Glastonbury use that to
line the lips first lights on its gonna
go in with the bullet just intensify it
and just fill in I have no I've got it
and I think in the middle I'm gonna use
Bond girl just to see how that looks
so quite like that with Bond girl added
over the top it just takes away the
purple and just mutes it a bit I really
really like that just gonna use a little
bit of Mack saw just to try and fill in
I keep his bow a bit more
cool that's the makeup done with that
right hair I'm going to do with this so
if my hair I've got a brand new curling
wand from nume the titan-3 professional
curling wand it's got three different
barrels inside oh oh how cool sap
they're all kind of around it I'm gonna
go with largest barrel because you know
me I do like my large curls this is an
American curling system there so it does
have an American plug so I just need to
get my adapter so like always I'm just
gonna section off half
it's much always take the one behind rap
from the very base the outside making
sure that hair stay flat against the one
the curls look so nice I'm actually so
impressed the barrels are so shiny it's
making my hair look really soft silky
and it comes off the barrel will go
really soft
I like that some some of the curls I
took smaller thinner sections on so I've
got a little bit more spirally then I've
got some really large waves coming
through as well I know that when I've
watched a few of the bloggers and
youtubers who use these ones to say how
amazing they are I've always wanted to
try once I'm so glad I have and I know
from watching their videos how much to
say that they stay in all day and then
you can wake up the next day and I'll
still be in and I personally love that
cuz it means that you kills they're
almost from up in a bit
and look even more kind of lived in and
those the kind of waves that I really
really like if you didn't want to get
one I also have some code so you can use
for it as well for 40% off you can use
the code purple locks I'll leave all
