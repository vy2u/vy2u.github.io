the way it's really occurring a lot in
this room because I'm in the bathroom

ready I've already been to the screening
this morning so I put a base coat of
foundation on but nothing more than that
so I'm going to quickly do them
everything that did earlier this was
nice and fresh game and then apply my
usual style of eye and whatnot I've
already killed my hair with my nume
curling for their kills at moments but
I'm a tie it up not sure I've got
incredible dress to try on so if you
want to get ready with me for the
insurgent premiere then keep watching
I'm just gonna quickly redo my silk
cream foundation on my new favorite
brush this is the so Eva power polish
brush at 1:07 incredible incredible
brush this is what this morning and I'm
just really going those my chicks I've
just eaten as you know I like sitting
down my lips and I've also been below my
nose because what else is new I always
have some sort of cold so so I've gotten
funny also going to do a little bit more
concealer I think so I'm gonna use a
Kevin Takata I think and also a little
bit of the collection mm lasting
perfection and just a little bit more of
that just to really
the eyes around my nose
I'm also publishing she's gonna wet
sponge off flipping approving yeah I
want to look pretty flawless so should
help hopefully it's pretty good
just into out my Laura mess be a
transparent powder
she wrote I brush just set that
concealer rather forget my contour with
the shower till three Bronson glow I'm
just gonna do that on your 301 rush
actually help me so really she's alone I
thought she's all just coming back in it
with my brush
taking large powder brush on my nose
like a Xena I'm just gonna open up my
neck and just a little bit more depth
around the forehead over those
cheekbones just even out the corners a
little bit and then to my cheekbones
with some beautiful highlight I'm using
NARS Copacabana
all right feel better and then use this
pick up the product and just start off
the live electric tends to use the
Phaedo trio motherís comp is beautiful
and it's just so stunning it's gonna
finish it off with a bit the hourglass
ambient lighting powder at my usual ray
you didn't lie to him I'm just gonna go
over that cheek extra blend extra around
just get such a beautiful glow a little
bit just get let's prep time when you
use the right Harriet Montrose as always
I'm just gonna add some blush I'm going
to use the Estee Lauder tease blush they
can't get us any more I'm really really
sorry but a nice shimmery pink or do the
same trick
okay so if you now on it's all about the
eyes and I decided to go with a mixture
of my two favorite palettes right now
the lorac pro 2 and the stunning
hourglass exposure palette that's a
modernist palette this is in exposure so
this is exposure shades it's a purple of
course I'm gonna go with the Purple's as
you know you know me I'm just gonna
start off with nectar which is his
peachy shade my crease really sorry if
the lighting is really hard by the way
it's nothing I can really do because I'm
in the bathroom
who's gonna be after on fishing color
you then moving on to this just actually
incredible palette and I'm going to take
this Momo movie purple hip in this very
side and I'm using one of my new so
we've the golden brushes in looks brow
light and I love this nice it's meant
for your brows or not but it's brilliant
with your eyes so I'm just going to add
this up to that crease and almost onto
that crease as well
I'm gonna use the edge of the brush to
draw my lower lash line - this is a
great brush it's a flax it does draw the
line so you're not easily drill it down
I think fall on into the wink
I'm just going to take the same brush
this is the looks soft divan brush and
we take this more pimply violet tone and
a bit onto the crease as well
take another brush this much more clean
is a bucket but it's okay I'm gonna take
this cream shade I'm going to use that
as a highlight but also use it to blend
out it's just a little less straight
then just to finish that off in the
inner corners I'm going to take a little
bit of snow a little bit of beige its
lighten those up now I'm just going to
do my brows to finish everything off I'm
going to use the Illamasqua precision
brow gel and this is it
all in W it I really love this at the
moment it is so beautiful there's a
difference from the anastasia dipbrow
okay brownstone just need to do my liner
I'm just going to use the Burberry
effortless liquid eyeliner and Kaitlyn's
gonna curl my eyelashes quickly after my
cleanse - water proof and to finish I'm
just going to use my new eye lashes from
mosquito and these are in the oh so
sweet style and I was in last night so
I've already cooked them slightly for a
little bit shorter it's great up there
so I'm gonna ask them to a cotton bud o
much and then you can see the edge of
cotton to apply to your lash
finish off I'm just going to use the map

online and fill the finish on a you see
power glass then nude pen in nude number
