ready with me video this centers around
two products first of all the new Real
Techniques pallets are they brought how
much art fantastic if you're looking for
new pallet
they have eyeshadows cream blush cream
highlighters lip glosses you name and
palette so they're super easy to use and
you can create some beautiful looks
that's why I wear now and I also kill my
hair with the brand new HDS dialers as
well
and I'll also tell you about a giveaway
to win yourself a pair of these beauties
F it later on but overall if you'd like
to know how to get this kind of beachy
waves and dark nighttime smoky eye look
then please keep watching okay so let's
get on with it
kind of start off the regen serum then
I'm going to go in with my Maybelline
eraser I find it just gets rid of those
dark circles first of all and you can
kind of work more color over the top but
just for banishing in the first I find
it's really quite good and today I'm
going to use loads of my new zoeva
brushes so excited Rani's I'm no
transmen before yeah brand new and so
yes so those gonna find out what these
like today so I'm gonna start with the
concealer buffer effect even realize
that was its name and that was what I
was gonna use it for so and I'm going to
use my Laura Mercier SIL cream as always
a night NARS sheer glow as always have I
found the truth and go to it so
perfectly I tend last night actually
might be able to tell it's in my face
obviously there don't put the town on my
face she's gonna lose my voice today yes
I'm gonna mix these posed together I'm
going to try it out with this gorgeous
so we've brush this is the silk finish
brush so I'm gonna see how that goes so
what I'm gonna do is put a pump of that
on there
but cuz Laura Mercier's darker for the
NARS so the two together should make
perfect tone so around these brushes are
so soft
they're so nice it's gonna work her in
like this brush a lot these brushes came
in a really nice handy set and they came
in this little zoeva pouches I'll say
show my cap some new brushes I'm quite
liking these I think that'll do it
doesn't like too much in the skin but it
was really gets rid of everything that
you don't want there I'm going to use my
soap &amp;amp; Glory solar powder for an even
more kind of flushing out out you're
going to like a club are big sort of do
I probably use the NARS Laguna bronzer
because that's just a little bit more
shimmery little bit darker but for this
let's be fine and I'm using these Zoe
the powder brush
that's what the solar-powered looks back
like by the way half a bronze a half a
kind of champagne II highlight but it's
not too shimmery so I just mix the two
together and it just gives a nice
glowing bronzing shade there we go
and I'm going to use my benefit
Browning's my Bobbi Brown I define brush
and this one is in medium exact white
like darker brows
that'll do next one realize - everyone
will want their eyebrows is dark but not
everyone's purple hair so
I think they'll do you finish them off
I'm just gonna use a little bit the brow
lash gel from the buzz shop they don't
really need it because of the wax I've
just put in but those extra little hairs
just keep them all in the same place
yeah if the rest is too tall I wanted to
show you the new real technique set and
that salmon Nikki you've just brought
out and this is a night owl makeup care
I think there may be two it comes with
four eyeshadows a gel eyeliner a cream
blush no powder blush cream highlighter
and you lip glosses so you've got a gold
shades and a darker red shade taking me
the mix up the kind of styles you want
to go far with this so I thought I'd
show you it got two more brushes from
zoeva
so I'm going to use the look soft
defying at which she looks at like the
Mac to one seven and I'm going to use
the looks petit crease which would
perfect for my eyes go I've got tiny
little eye sockets I'm gonna start with
the lighter shade just like champagne a
girl shade
well that's so nice go shoot me that is
in fact I'm just gonna take that be in a
corner and the inner part of my eye I'm
gonna bellow the rest while I'm here
just cool I'm just gonna put it
underneath cuz again it's perfect brow
highlight shade as well okay so yeah
corners perfect my spot now it's off to
find a brush I think I might build up
the coolest through it so what my ease
is a bit this blush first little bit
about it just after a cream
then I'm going to take the purple mist
darker shade even really nice and
pigmented really like these and I was
going to put that into the very center
of the yeah so just overlapping that
ping I think what I'm going for really
it's kind of a gradient from light to
dark at the very edges so you look down
to the crease okay next color I'm going
to use the glittery color as if for the
very outer edges and then the matte
black dark navy shade it's the crease
color put that on the very I'm gonna
move over trap your cheek crease brush
actually this might be a lot easier then
just gonna use the dark navy
brush it's gonna go back over with the
purple game just through the middle to
make sure that's definitely highlighted
there and lower lash as well it's
trapped under this brush it's perfect
for doing that this is such a great
shape
that's an athlete Oakland blend in our
top edge so it's like that that's one I
done just finish off the other ID that's
done I just need to clear up about this
so I'm going to use the pro longwear
concealer I use nw20 on that same can
see the brush okay into both areas to
get rid of all that fallout
take a little bit more it's like not
Scheidler just what's over that area
okay so now I'm gonna go back to the set
and I'm going to highlight so I'm going
to use the so either face shape none
I'm guessing this bit perfect for
contouring use it for the cream
highlighter it's really pretty
I'm also just going to quickly found in
my face I take the silk finish again and
to my hourglass from the lighting powder
and just hold up underneath mattify
wing to take the zoeva Xie cheek and the
lovely pink blush shade
so then I am just going to put on o.j
eyeliner don't even think got an easily
so we either wind liner brush and I'm
just gonna go ahead and get some of that
onto my brush doesn't need much just
because it already got so much kind of
shadow
and then I'm just going to use my
favorite mascara at moment which is the
Clarins everything I use by the way or
the link down below so I'll be able to
link this but it's a brand new one a
thing and it's waterproof and it just
makes my lashes amazing I've never had
such an effect from my lashes before
and because this is quite a dramatic eye
look I'm going to go with my usual nude
beige YSL rouge looked lipstick I'm just
going to go over the top of that with
the lip gloss out of the pot and that is
the finished face Marc
the way I'm wearing the dress from
Stella calm but this on the draping
that's sheer then this goes at the top
in the floral print and it's just a
little cute dress but how nice is this
print though so so pretty and now I'm
going to curl my hair with my brand new
HD lavender pastel collection stylers
these are from very dark OT k and in
fact very will be giving away a pair of
these soon a giveaway in collaboration
with the blog program I'll leave all
descriptions and info down below in the
description bar yes so if you want to
get ponies self though these are from
very ok I haven't killed my hair with
pearls straightness or stylist in it
quite a while now so let's see how this
goes got my ghd's are warmed up for the
navy let's the take about 20 seconds and
they also switch off automatically so if
you ran out the house and you forget it
straight it's wrong so need to go back
they all just switch off what i'm gonna
do it is take bigger sections so i think
i'm going to do is do the back first so
i'm just going to take two sides of my
hair tie them up I'm using my brand new
tangle teezer
in purple and pink this that it would be
pretty apt seeing as I often go between
pink and purple I'm gonna use my GHD
curl hold spray nice stuff is amazing
it's got heap checked ins in it some
sort of formula in it whereby if you use
it on your hair and then curl it it
reacts with the heat and it holds the
curl it's much better it's almost like
some self hairspray curl hold hybrid
thing notice you can either put this on
in sections or I have to just stick it
all over a big section of hair brush it
through you also don't meet hair wet you
wanna make sure that it's covered I'm
going to take sections bigger sections
because I want quite large waves so what
I do is keep it on a flat start around
here twist
just hair just it again and then call
through then when you get to the end I
kill it back on itself
they left so again it's just sort of
like this take it from here and then I
put my hand around the edge to make sure
that none of it falls beneath where the
plates are pull it all out obviously try
not to drag your hair don't make the tip
don't clamp the straightness on your
hair so much that you literally pulling
your hair out as you pull now could have
some soft give got the same time you to
make sure the plaits touching your hair
and came around the back pull it round
wrap it back and then you slide it out
and you want to turn this one the
opposite way so the opposite way from
your head wrap it all back up
and then have it just everything really
hope you enjoy this tutorial I think
that's what I use a link download I
remember there is to give away with very
cool UK and the blog program to add a
pair of the lavender or any color HD
styler that I used so make sure strip
that out again I'll leave the
description below or to follow me on all
the channels below if you like to
capture everything outside doing my last
video is just there and I will see you
all again real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
