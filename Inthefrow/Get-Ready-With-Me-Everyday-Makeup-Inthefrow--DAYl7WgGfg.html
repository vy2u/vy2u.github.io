day makeup video first of all I like to
start with the Garnier really long
concealer in fair obviously after
applying a little bit of moisturizer and
I'll rub this over my eyes and under my
eyes just to really brighten lock fresh
in the face the morning before then
applying foundation ha BB cream recently
I've been really loving the Elizabeth
Arden BB cream with my expert face brush
from Real Techniques I just dab that
around and my face these different areas
and then I'll go back use circular
motions with brush strokes over my face
just to really whip that it really mean
well making sure to get it and around
the ears down the neck over the chin is
absolutely no areas where the BB cream
doesn't touch so you don't get any kind
of streaks and lines soft round brush
strokes and so fast as you really make
sure that it's blended really well into
your skin sinks them really really
nicely this officer takes couple of
minutes just to get it absolutely
perfect on the skin and went into the
hairline as well obviously too so you
don't get marks on your hairline
the BB cream gives the most amazing jewy
finish it's one of the best BB creams
and sort of foundations I've actually
used I've been losing every day because
it really is most flawless finish but
also quite light what's super doing then
I've really been loving the map
concealers do your pitching finish
concealer with the Real Techniques I
think this is blender brush and which is
brilliant for getting all around and
guys nice off go around the under the
eyes over the eyes and then down the
side of the nose really you get a really
light brush strokes ensure it's already
blended into the skin really well I mean
this kids see this amazing it stays put
all day especially if you make sure that
you set it will stay put all day it
really brightens up scared and then in
your eyes I mean is definitely my most
go to concealer especially for eating
these out things but usually using their
lot in the day reason thinks it's
amazing
then this is my secede Oh setting powder
translucent setting powder again seeking
the same brush and patented little bit
onto the brush going up my t-zone to
make sure there's actually no and I
thought do we finish over those and it's
under the eyes then my NARS Laguna
bronzer and the Real Techniques contour
brush just to contour my cheekbones and
besides my face just also give that kind
of definition
this is a really really good brush if
you want to start contouring creating
that more for definition into sheet
bones and hollows of your cheeks
a little bit downsize my nose just to
get that a little bit more contouring
effect sound the nose just to pin it
even more and then I use the powder
brush just add a little bit more fuller
bronzer just a forehead on my nose and
just a soft blend in the contour so that
we are blended
I'll make sure I go all the way down the
neck as well just to make sure that
means that the same color my neck as I
am on the face
then I use a naked basics palette with
the Clarins so I know clearly I brow
brush which is really fantastic a really
tiny brush is perfect for doing our
brows I use two four colours from Naked
basics palette and just very lightly
trettel brush strokes through the
eyebrows just to really and create the
illusion of little little hairs just to
fill them in really and just for a bit
more of a stronger brow bring it up and
look at the stronger brow at the moment
so that's why I like to kind of fill
them in and start deepen up there close
my eyebrows really so I'll just try and
make sure I've got quite a full shape on
the top and then drag it down to point
the end
and same with the other eyebrows
and then I'm the body shop and eyebrow
mascara brush which is perfect to set
your eyebrows in place it takes away any
excess reduces the color a little bit so
it's not too harsh and you'll find that
your eyebrows painful darling then I use
of the illamasqua eyeshadow in slink
with the map-21 seven fluffy brush which
is amazing thought any kind of eyeshadow
and it's definitely a brush that you
should definitely invest in it sometimes
thick
so just for everyday I'll put that on my
list so stop writing them off shimmer
and then this is the Aiko eyeliner which
is absolutely fantastic and by far my
favorite eyeliner I've ever used
it's super easy it's jet black and in
here I'm fine it with one hand and it's
super easy
makes a perfect cat eye and I've been
using this now for a couple months and
it's still going strong so I highly
recommend this and it's only about ten
pounds
where some of the more high-end ones the
similar come on 20 pounds so I would
highly recommend this and I think you
can also get it moment on places like
QVC in SF 2 which are about 15 pounds of
that bar he really also give the other
eye you can't make sure that we're
pretty much symmetrical
and then I use my Shu Uemura eyelash
curlers which I recently bought after
hearing all the hype about them and
thought right I need to get these and
they are actually fantastic so again if
you thinking of getting them definitely
best for parisa brilliant and then I've
been loving the Maybelline falsies a lot
recently so that's like we're playing
here good coating of that and a bit on
my bottom lashes as well
and the same on the other icons
and then this is a tarte blush in
blessed with Real Techniques brush a
brush which is really great purpose of
applying a very nice off loose coating
of blush it's not never two strikes the
bristles are so soft and long and thin
and not seem highly compacted so it
sounds a really nice Sheen ill-being
cheeks is really beautiful blush color
the samosa to my cheeks apples in the
cheeks a little bit up their cheekbones
then I'll add a little bit of the
balance me sitting spray just to set out
on face and then my Mac creme Cup
lipstick which is my go to every single
Danes are so natural like a nude pink
and finished off with the Clarins lip
Perfector in rose just a little tiny bit
of glass
and that is it so set my hair down rough
it up a bit and make sure it's all in
play a bit of volume and that is the
finished look a very cheery natural
finish mostly with the eyeliner to give
it a bit more definition to the eyes and
a nice breakfast let's really hope you
