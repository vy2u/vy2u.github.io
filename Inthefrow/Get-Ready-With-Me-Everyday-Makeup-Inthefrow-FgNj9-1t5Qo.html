filming a makeup routine for you this is
going to be my everyday makeup routine
as you may have seen from the title and
this I filmed over six months ago now
and to date it is my most popular video
which is amazing it's had it over
200,000 years but since that time I have
bought so many products tried out so
many new techniques and really changed
up the way I do my everyday makeup
especially for work I'm going to work do
to look a bit more sophisticated and
made up so I thought I would film is for
you show you how I've updated everything
and show you some my new favorite
products as well a lot of these products
are high-end but what I'll try to do is
in the description bar I will list
everything that I use and if I can find
rugs or alternative that I also love or
that I might use day-to-day then I'll
lists out just beneath it as well to
give you a bit more of an inexpensive
option so hopefully that'll help but if
you'd like to see how I do my makeup
every single day then please keep
watching I start off with Hydra laron
because this I don't know this recently
has been really really good
it's meant to hold up 2,000 times its
weight in water with high hyaluronic
acid so it's just a really nice base
just to make sure these skin is really
nice and hydrated then I'll use the on
release nourishing moisturizer at its
finest beautiful moisturizer at the
moment very much coveted in the makeup
industry and I'm just finding it works
really nicely as a base for foundation I
recently stumbled on the Illamasqua skin
base foundation I absolutely adore this
where it has been on my life I use the
shade 5.5 in this and I apply it with
the silk finish zoeva brush modulus find
incredible really blending in the
foundation
maybe not seamless and absolutely
perfect so these two work together like
a dream and this shade is absolutely
perfect for my skin when my base is a
Tyler done and come to get the perfect
and then like to go in with two products
that I used to conceal and lighten my
skin so I use the Estee Lauder Double
Wear concealer and I use the muck breath
and pride in light boost the concealer
is in shade right to medium number two
so I'll add the Double Wear into the
very corners of my eyes where it's the
most dark and then I'll add the prep and
prime beneath this and triangular shape
not too much product but just enough
it's going to blend beautifully then
I'll take my Sigma tapered blending
brush 8:40 and with little swirling
motions I'll blend those two colors
together under the eyes work it over the
eye sockets as well but also down into
the triangular shape under the eye to
really lighten on that area and just to
add a bit more definition between the
base and the under eyes to really
highlight and make it look super bright
and perfected when that's all ready and
on the days I know I'm not going to be
using a dark powder eyeshadow I all then
pound my skin so I will use the ambient
lighting very light powder from outlets
I've been using this for a quite a while
now and I just find it's perfect it's
just so transparent it's nuts no shimmer
in there
completely soft matte powder when that's
already it's time to contour and I am
absolutely in love with my new film star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow sculpt and highlight
palette this is from Charlotte Tilbury
it's absolutely beautiful it's quite
pricey it is around 50 pounds to buy but
I find that your new TV with a better
tax it's super pigmented and it's so
beautiful so this will probably last me
a very long time plus of how beautiful
is that packaging this is so pretty so I
will use my Mac but large contour brush
let's show the sedap and I don't you
don't need to swirl it around to pick up
too much product because Lynch is a
little down the brush into this pack
pick up just the right amount but go of
the hollows and up onto the side of the
ten fold a little bit over the top of
the forehead and then also underneath
the chip just don't really define those
areas so it's in an e shape with
everyone always says when that's
absolutely perfect I'll then add the
Real Techniques contour brush and I will
dab that into my lighting section you
have a little bit product then up I'll
apply it just above that comet or to
highlight my cheekbones and I'll work it
up mostly for my eyebrow bone as well
and again just create that beautiful
moon shape and to really add a bliss and
society face and I'll also add it to my
Cupid's bow because it works really
beautifully then what I like to do is
add the Estee Lauder bronze goddess
powder this is in shade 0-1 light I mean
it is quite dark so yes it's a lighter
shade but if you just need a little bit
a time I use the Real Techniques powder
brush with this dab it into it and I
usually work it down my neck to make
sure that any lines from a foundation or
the contour powder and beautifully
blended down the neck and all the shades
that got
say now it's time to do my eyebrows I
love to benefit browsing this is in the
shade medium and let's go for the medium
shade I'll take a little bit of the wax
and a little bit of powder um do you
think my Bobbi Brown I define a brush
which is perfect for doing eyebrows I'll
start halfway across my eyebrows and
just start working it through and then
pulling it down into the tail at the end
and making a perfect point before then
filling in the top dragging it down the
top into the point and then I'll very
lightly go over the very front this
means that you'll get more of a
gradation between the front and the tail
of your eyebrow and it's Kate I think
it's quite flattering
rather than having really harsh eyebrows
from start to finish you'll get it too
like I said a gradation between the
front and the back just to make sure
that they look really natural because
you always have much finer hairs at the
very front of the eyebrows anyway so why
cover that up and make them look super
harsh and super fill them after I do
each of my eyebrows i'll also add the
bodyshop Brown lash jail just to go
through them and make sure that they
will definitely stay put and in that
shape all day now it's time for
eyeshadow I've fallen in love with the
Charlotte Tilbury cool chameleons
they're so stunning I have got this one
in dark pearl I also have fun behavior
which is a beautiful bronze shade well
this is dark pearl and I can only
describe it as a very deep murky purple
mixed with a
almost browned tote and I absolutely
adore perfectly shades of my eyes this
is a beautiful cream eyeshadow and it
will turn you on your eyes for 14 hours
so when you apply it you need to work
quite quickly so you apply it as a cream
i vant on to the area that you really
wanted to be applying to and then I'll
use my Mac to one seven blending brush
and that start to just blend this to the
very outer corners of my eyes almost
halfway across the eye maybe two-thirds
of us see I will then blend it out into
a wing at the very very edge it takes a
bit of time to work this out and to
really get a perfect shape but when you
do if that looks so stunning it's so
pretty I'll do that both Isis make sure
they're completely symmetrical and
perfected and then I'll take my
brand-new and most favorite icon quad
which is a Tom Ford and I've got this in
orchid haze I adore this it's so
pigmented it's so beautiful it's so
lovely so I use the very lightest shade
which is very nice champagne like
champagne it's so pretty and I'll take
the Sigma looks petit crease brush
number two three one don't bit into
there and then I'll add it into the very
inner corners of my eyes to brighten and
I'll pull it into the first third of my
eye over the top of the chameleon by
Charlotte Tilbury to make sure that for
beautiful blended I'll then take another
blending brush this is look soft definer
brush from zoeva and I'll just blow
those two together and to make sure
there's absolutely no creases in between
and they just blend with a gradation
between the cream champagne into the
darker purple
I'll then map use my Shu Uemura eyelash
curlers and spend a bit of time giving
their eyelashes a really good curl to
stay in place before applying the
Clarins intense mascara which I've
mentioned so many times and I just love
as it's waterproof so it keeps my lashes
curled in this position all day and no
twas a mascara I have ever used as
managed this task so I'm absolutely love
it it's fantastic I actually film this
without pressing record so if you can
see some color on my lips and my cheeks
that's because they're already applied
already but I'm just gonna quickly show
you what I did so I use the Charlotte
Tilbury cheek to chic
swish and pop this is in the
color first love it looks as though it's
going to be super subtle and nude and
neutral which is but it just adds the
perfect flush of color and blend so
beautifully into the contour you've just
done to do that I'm using the zoeva luxe
shear cheek brush which I love now it's
the only from the youths rebel of sharks
it's a perfect contour shape and last
but very much not least is the lipstick
and you may be aware that I absolutely
adore the YSL rouge for locked lipstick
it's not only beautiful to look at but
it's beautiful to apply just for those
days and I want a little bit more pink
I'll go in with Illamasqua Fable
lipstick but into the very middle and it
does have a little bit more baby pink
Sheen is everything that is my complete
everyday makeup look from start to
finish this probably takes me around 25
minutes I would say
and I find it works perfectly for me
makes me feel really confident and
really well put together thank you so
