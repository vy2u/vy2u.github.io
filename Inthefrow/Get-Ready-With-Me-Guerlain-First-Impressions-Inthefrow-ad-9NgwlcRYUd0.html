exciting video this is a collaboration
between myself and Golan which as you
probably know is one of my absolute
favorite luxury beauty brands they knew
that I was a big big fan of their lab
tear my perfume which if you haven't
smelled already is absolutely stunning
and the bottle is gorgeous and it has
leper t12 noir on the front and it's so
sweet because ghulam and like a tear of
moi they're wonderful little character
sent me a letter just to say hello and
how much they're excited to be working
with me and to help me introduce the
brand new collection so what I thought I
would do is apply a full face of Galan
so it's almost I could get ready with me
where I can then show you the brand new
products at the end don't only give you
a sneak peak now because they're so
beautiful I thought you said I would do
a full face of glam makeup and then I'm
going to show you the new Galan
collection full uh Petite robe mwah
so without further ado let's get right
into it seeing as this video it's going
to fit all about the La Petite robe
Noire collection I thought I'd have a
sprit right before I start so feminine
is so iconic it's just absolutely
beautiful for placing on your perfume
sound okay I'm gonna start after the
ghulam meteorites oxygen moisturizer and
Regents booster this is so beautiful to
apply as a day moisturizer simple cream
it's so light its moisturizers and
really has so much radiance into skin
you can see my skills really beautiful
and almost glowing now I'm going to
apply the meteorites base this is almost
like a primer in terms of my base I
think I'm going to go for the meteorites
baby glow here I have light and I have
medium I think I'm probably going to be
around the middle of these two
now I'm going to use the precious light
illuminator I'm going to put that then
go to dot live anywhere that I feel
needs a bit more light boost needs
brightening up anywhere so of course I'm
going to place this and place my eyes
around my nose and underneath my chin
I'm going to use that same foundation
brush just to work tap it in next up I'm
just going to use some of this beautiful
compact this is the meteorites skin
perfecting eliminating matte powder onto
this gorgeous girl and brush some
underneath under eyes I want to set that
concealer to make sure it doesn't go
anywhere next up I just like to add some
natural bronze really so I'm going to
use the Terracotta Four Seasons in
natural and of course you can use the
lighter shades the dark shades or mix
them all together for lovely warm flush
I'm sweeping into the whole pan and I've
made around my temples with my cheeks
little on my nose and then down my neck
I am going for much more subtle I don't
want to be overly contoured but just
roms and bright and fresh gonna add a
touch of blush this is sea rose morning
Rose blush she's a very very may sweep
over cheeks
the eyebrow pencil and this is in number
one brown I'm also going to use a quick
touch of the brow kit which is gorgeous
I want to get this little go just in a
very front my brows just to mix up the
color a tap okay as much I try to keep
ease as natural as physically possible
you know me as Co bigger and bigger but
ugh I'm pretty much got there the
Aaliyah's gal I'll have some absolutely
beautiful palettes so I'm going to go
for this one which you see for colors in
the Les Sables again very very shades
and it's going to apply this lovely
champagne pink into the inner corner of
my eye and then I take this rose pink
and apply that all over the lid I'm
going to apply this mid Brown into the
crease of my eye now blend that in with
my little finger and all I want to do is
add a little bit of this dark brown
underneath the very outer corner of the
lower lash line I'm going to use the
dark brown on the top lid as well
I am going to tightline though with the
Kajal call me Kajal liner which is
amazing and I'm going to apply it the
girl on waterproof mascara this is a
whole girl and look obviously excluding
the lips which I'm going to tell you all
about right now so to go along with the
very iconic clappity robe Noire
fragrance Galan have created levity robe
Noire makeup range and arrange consists
of nail varnishes and lipsticks so first
of all let's talk about the packaging
the brand new products go along with the
beautiful appetit over moi bottle so got
the same top same style it obviously
matches a full collection the lipsticks
has come out like this and then L
varnishes lit just pops off like this of
course has a small clip brush I'm going
to apply it shade 11 which is the nude
in the range first of all so soft it is
so silky smooth to apply that's that's
beautiful it's so soft it feels so
hydrating I love that in terms of
layering the color as well is quite
buildable now that is a large large
range of these lipsticks a lot of them
so you are sure to find the perfect kind
of color that you like
it goes from purples if is number 70
through to red this is number 66 of
corals reds moves
it's a beautiful pink that is number 65
this is a really really bright pink
number two I also have brown this is
number 12
and there's also shade number seven
black perfecto which is quite a dark
plum II black which you can layer on top
of other shades this is number 11 layer
it up over top of the lipsticks to
create a much more smoky effect
it feels like I've applied a bomb with
all this beautiful color in it as well
and here are seven of the nail polishes
right almost neon coral number 42 got a
really dark purple shimmer it's number
seven it's stunning stunning pink is
number two this is a hybrid almost
between a neon coral and a red and this
is number three it's my favorite this is
number 63 wonderful red is number 22 and
also finally is number one
my first nail polish which is a light
pink shimmer the third thing that's
really wonderful about these is the
scent
what's nail polishes are dry the
varnishes and lipsticks are both scented
with Liberty Road noir which is so
wonderful and how nice to kind of pull
that theme through your whole collection
I'm just going to try on this one number
66
just makes my lips really plumped and
shiny which is consistency is so
wonderful
can't you didn't describe it and the
thing that I love about this collection
is that the lipsticks and the nails are
all so bright and so vibrant it's as
such a pop of color and it's just so
wonderfully shiny no beautiful is this
