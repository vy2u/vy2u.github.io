day makeup hair tutorial this is what I
come wearing part of a few week I've
seen in a week or two I really kind of
cranberry plum smokey eye is really
bright plum lips with my brand new lime
crime quite a very lipstick which I love
and really curly hair with just an
ordinary barrel curl F and Babli and
that's it so if you only know how to get
this look please keep watching so I'm
going to start off with my Melfi tap eye
contour gel does had a bit of hydration
to us leave my eyes and then my nude
radiant day moisturizer which I'm living
at the moment just to really get really
hydrated base the rest of that money
Cartman
then I'll use the Porefessional primer
from benefit just over my cheeks and a
little bit down my t-zone just to make
another flawless base foundation and
then I use a Garnier Revlon in fair it
just really gets rid of red soft circles
or dark circles around the eyes and a
soft brightens them are ready for them
put foundation over the top
and then on to my favorite ever
Foundation which is the laura mercier
silk cream with the Real Techniques
expert face brush this shade is in beige
ivory and this usually matches me really
well when I'm so I've got the tan ever
happens this day night and later so this
would seem perfectly with the skin tone
if I was just about to go out from is
you but it's the most flawless and
caught them a high coverage foundation
that I've got and it's a perfect for an
evening out special occasion somewhere
that you may want a little bit more
coverage on and I couldn't recommend
this foundation anymore just working it
into the hairline over the eyebrows over
the eye sockets and also down the neck
just to create a really seamless
flawless face
and then I'm going with my mac
prolongwear concealer with the Real
Techniques blending brush thickness one
is it's a really great brush just to get
perfectly into the under eye area and
onto any small areas you want covering
and your blemishes on spots
example so I dab that all over my face
and then I go back in and very lightly
dab around the areas that I need
covering and it's just a fantastic
concealer covering anything that you
like on your face and it will stay put
all day
I'll then set that with the algaas
ambient light powder and again with the
blending brush and just Pat that over
the area that I've just covered with a
concealer just to set that on a place
for doing it just gives it a really
flawless blurred out effect but Carmex
just make sure my lips are prepped for
later and then the NARS Laguna bronzer
with the NARS contour brush and cold
there aren't any like it so you'll be
able to find it really easily but that's
perfect for getting the perfect contour
shape in the hollows of the cheeks so I
just I'll put that on there first just a
soft and fine powder and exactly the
right area that I need it for then later
on I'll go in with the Real Techniques
contour brush and start yourself shade
and blend that edge so it's not as harsh
in line as it looks at the moment
I'll also run that down side my nose and
my nose again just to contour my nose
very slightly
this is the Real Techniques contour
brush as I said and the soft work it off
onto my temples and the areas of the Sun
would naturally hit then I use a nice
multiple in Copacabana and the Real
Techniques buffing brush which is
perfect for this really just a salt and
fly on to the very end of the brush and
to swirl over the cheekbones and up onto
the eyebrow bone then I use the
illamasqua androgen pigment which I
adore for cheek colour or lip color some
you've met with the stippling brush from
Real Techniques to apply a very light
cream base and just a bit of a pink
flush of the cheeks really and then I'll
go over that with the benefit rockateur
blush which I got for Christmas and just
add a little bit shiny shimmer over the
top of that cream blush if it'll stick
really nicely onto the cream then I use
the bodyshop eyebrow gel just add a bit
of gel so my lashes before I will use it
powder this one from Naked basics
palette and I think it's make it to the
shade it's a darker Brown I'm using the
Clinique eyebrow brush i define a brush
and it's a brilliant brush really really
small bristles so you can get a perfect
kind of eyebrow shape I find this works
best to me
perfect color so do you like a slightly
dark brown
as you can see I drew out the shape of
my lower eyebrow shape first and then
you start to fill in a book fat so if
you get the lower shape first you then
can start drawing the front fill in the
middle draw on the top and then some
carry on down the tail of the eyebrow I
find that that works best me
and then when that's all done to fish
off a little bit more gel to perfectly
set it in place and get rid of any
excess powder so now I'm gonna use my
body sharp palate I got this place a
plum palette I'm not sure if you still
get this but I'm showing so many
different products out there on the
market they're very similar and with my
Mac to 1/7 blending brush I'm just
leaving the very lightest shade all over
the lid then I'm going to use this
cranberry sauce shimmery cranberry color
which is gorgeous and just run that
through the crease and the outer half of
my lids and then I'll use the Mac pencil
brush just to get a really precise
eyeshadow application just to create the
perfect wing and to run it down along
the lower lash line just a third along
the lower lash line
and then I'll go back to my two one
seven again and add the slightly lighter
soft topi shimmery color just with my
very leads to some kind of blend the
creamy color I'm a cranberry together
and then I'll use bit of the darker plum
in the very outer corner this is so dark
that look reduce a little bit more here
I'm just taking my blending brush again
and just getting rid of any fallout
that's come out with the eye shadow very
lightly sweeping it over and decide
blend that back in so you got perfect
application again then going back to my
two one seven and the three miss color
and trim that underneath my eyebrows
down onto the crumpled shades to blend
those two shades together and to fade it
down through the brow bone and doing it
the same way going down towards a lower
lash line
and then the same on the other night
so first of all with the crumpled sheet
flinging the out with a two on seven and
a pencil brush
something with a lighter color all over
the lid and blending through to a little
bit more cranberries increase the light
to shade the eye brow bone blending it
down onto the dark color just to fade it
through and then blending down the side
to about a third along the lower lash
line then I use with the Mac vanilla
pigment to the very inner corners of my
eyes as it really just brightens oh
those are beautiful a really great
pigment for that and I'll add it
underneath my eyebrows against the
brightness up and a little bit to my
Cupid's bow there's a little fishing
touch this but if the NASA Queen a
bronzer again on a large real techniques
powder brush tragic all the way down my
neck and a little bit over my face as
well but it's all blends everything
together perfectly then I'll use the ICO
liquid metallic liner which I love at
the moment brilliant
tiny nib so you can get a really precise
line and it's kind of a push up
action on the on the pen so you can kind
of add more ink if you sort of need a
marv a darker line
these are quite easy to use as fun as
you can see
and same on the other lash right along
lash line and then wink out
other news my shoe Uemura eyelash
careless my eyelashes extremely straight
so they need a lot of help and then the
ico mascara which i found is really
really great actually give them a little
bit of kale I've got a lot of definition
a little bit for you
and then what I'm Celeste my favorite
bit at the moment so I'm first of all
using the Mac night moth I'll lipliner
here it's actually quite a bit darker
than this as it shows on film but it's
more of perfectly shade so I'm lining my
lips are not the best of this so I'm
quite slow with it but this line all of
the lips in the night month
and then I'm going to do exactly the
same over the top with the cherry lip
liner from Mac which is actually a
beautiful shade and you'll see in a
second I also fill in my entire lips
with this just had a great face
the reason that I'm mixing the two
together is so that get this more of a
perfect shade for lipstick I'm about to
use but I could also buy a magenta
lip liner and that would suit this
lipstick perfectly I've got to use
this is my favorite lipstick at the
moment the boysenberry lipstick from LAN
crime it's a perfect purple magenta
shade and that is the finished makeup
take down my hair and now I'm just gonna
curl it with my bubble list I think it's
1.5 inch barrel but I put all the
information down low in the bath this is
a really easy technique to use this
place the barrel Cola right underneath
and behind the hair and just wrap it
around hold it for me about 10 seconds
see how hot your hair is and then let it
out making sure you kind of hold the
curl as it comes out so it kind of keeps
a tail in place and just do that all
over the hair in sections I just do the
back and in the two sides I didn't quite
manage to film the rest off and do my
hair but that's all I did
just the back and the two sides taking
self large sections to create large
lovely curls then I add the leek staff
at hairspray just to hold those in place
and I'll have them into my roots just to
give it a great volume for the rest of
the night and that's it everything so I
really hope that you found out someone
useful know if it's firing for your own
