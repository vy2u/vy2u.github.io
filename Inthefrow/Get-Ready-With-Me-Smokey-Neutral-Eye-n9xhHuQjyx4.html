makeup look for you my last makeup look
for New Year's Eve went really really
well a lot of you really loved it and
gave me some amazing comments so thank
you so much for that so I thought that I
would do another makeup look that I wear
on the days I don't wear a smoking plum
I I really and it's more of sort of a
neutral look I've kind of done similar
things before this one kind of centers
around the wet wild walking on eggshells
palette which I'm loving just so simple
three simple colors and look beautifully
on the eye so I just use those and a
nice bright pink lip that's always and
that's it so if you want to know how i
got this makeup look then please keep
watching
so I'm going to start off with the time
bomb holiday in a bottle and I've
applied that all over my face already
just to give it that kind of glow
underneath and then I'm going to use a
regen moisturizing cream all over my
face then I'm going to use a Garnier
roll-on concealer in fair just to
brighten my under eyes I'm going to use
my Real Techniques expert face brush
with the Laura Mercier sort cream
foundation in beige ivory mixed with the
Lancome foundation in shade number one
dub that all around my face and then
I'll go back and blend
you get all choked up let's see what the
 do you think you're doing me then
I'm gonna take the mac prolongwear
concealer with the Real Techniques
blending brush and apply that all over
my under eyes as my eyelids and slightly
down the side of my nose just to
brighten you conceal any imperfections
I'm sure and I use the hourglass ambient
lighting powder does I set all of that
into place again with the same Real
Techniques brush to contour my cheeks
I'm going to use Illamasqua Hollow
pigment with the Real Techniques contour
brush just into the hollows of my cheeks
just to give them that contoured effect
you get all
and see what the do you think you
then I use the Real Techniques
foundation brush and go down the Sun
into my nose just to give that thinning
effects and then with the Illamasqua
sculpting powder duo which I adore I'm
just gonna go over the top of that
hollow pigment with the same contour
brush then I have some comics is to prep
my lips for later on and then I'll use a
soap &amp;amp; Glory bronzing highlighting
powder over my forehead down my neck and
a little bit over my cheeks just to add
a little bit more of a bronzed and
highlighted look and then I'm just going
to go back to the Illamasqua sculpting
powder duo with the highlighting color
and my Real Techniques buffing brush
just to push that into the cheekbones
and over Cupid's bow down the nose and
around underneath the eyebrows
then I'm gonna take the benefit
rockateur blusher which I'm really
loving at the moment as it gives such a
gorgeous sort of deep pink Sheen to the
cheeks and I'm using that with the Real
Techniques blush a brush
then I'm going to use the walking on
eggshells palette from went wild
so you're easy to use it spells out few
cycle what you need to do but here I'm
just going to use the brow bone color in
the inner corners of my eyes really soft
brighten those up and I'm gonna use the
eyelid color this sort of very light
shiny pink just on my very eyelids
then I'm going to go back to the brow
bone color and just go underneath my
eyebrows just to highlight those and
then here I'm taking the cream color
this lovely brown and just going into
the crease of my eye just a dark matte
up add the shadow and just add more
definition to the eye all of this I'm
doing with the Mac c17 brush
here I'm just pushing more if I call it
into my lower lids by flattening the t17
brush just to get the perfect shape to
lie my undereyes then I'm just going to
lightly blend all of those together then
I'm going to use my Urban Decay Naked
basics palette that I use a lot for my
eyebrows just taking the two Brown
colors drawing on the bottom of my
eyebrow filling in the tail and I'm
filling in the top and the front
it's cool here I'm using the Clinique
I define a brush and I'm going to take
the bodyshop eyebrow gel does a set
olivine to place here I'm taking the ICO
skinny liner and black which I love for
creating the perfect cat eye and I'm
just literally going to draw her on a
black line right against my lashes and
up into soft feline flick
then I'm gonna take my Schumer at
eyelash curlers and kill my lashes and
then I will apply some of the ICO magic
kit mascara I think it's called I'll
leave all of the descriptions the
products down below
then for my lips I'm taking the Lord and
berry kiss proof Shea's lip liner to
line my lips it's a really pretty sort
of light pink shade
then I'm taking my new favorite lipstick
from Illamasqua which is in Fable it's a
gorgeous pinky peach color which is
pretty much the androgen pigment rolled
into a lipstick and I absolutely adore
it it's quite sort of chalky matte look
so over the top I've added the wire sell
nude beige Rouge for looked lipstick
which is absolutely beautiful so
moisturizing and such a lovely Sheen and
that's everything
okay so that's the finished makeup look
I hope you've enjoyed it
I try to use a few different products
that I haven't use before especially my
last makeup video so maybe we can solve
them it makes up a few things if you
liked anything that used a lot of things
might have been more design and makeup
things like that I'm sure you can find
cheap skirts from the high street to get
a very similar effect that's just what I
used if you liked the video then please
give it thumbs up and if you are new it
would be amazing if you were to
