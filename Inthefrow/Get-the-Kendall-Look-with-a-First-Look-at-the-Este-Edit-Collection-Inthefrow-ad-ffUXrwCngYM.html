the honor of being joined by Victor who

come all the way over from New York
thank you for having me thank you so
much for joining me on the channel so I
cannot wait here applies to tell me
about oh my god there's so that's where
should I start
okay so it's defined by three Beauty
attitudes right the edgy is embarrassed
and editors glow okay so it's three
Beauty attitudes that really kind of
define who you are and your makeup likes
so the edgiest is made up of like super
bright and vivid colors textures are
super bright high pigment things that
are fun creative then I got the bears
which makes things super super bear it's
really defined by the texture of the
skin ingredients inside the products
foundations blushes six incredible nude
lipsticks and lip liner yeah it's really
cool waiting long hair yeah and then we
got editors picks which are like glowy
products with flash illuminators we got
cattle palette inside of that love that
you pick the edges by the way can it
back my youthful days and I was a bit
cool really like Rupp cool it's
just more playful for me so I loved it
she meets we get into the tutorial oh
let's show them so yeah so if you want
to see how to get it look guys just keep
watching keep watching I'm gonna start
with a little bean team hmmm team is a
really great moisturizing cream that
makes your skin super iridescent E and
Chloe she can use of some moisturizer as
well yeah Wow
it's a moisturizer that gives you Erin
essence and luminescence I love that
let's see all right your skin is glowing
prepped a little bit with late night
eraser which is everything that it
sounds like it's gonna do an air race
any damage from the night before
puffiness dark circles that's also got
this really cool ingredient hyaluronic
acid which draws moisture under the eye
let's start your skin with skin blowing
mom squeak skin glowing mom is a hybrid
product a hybrid product is one product
that does more than one thing so skin
glowing bomb is a foundation but it's
also a moisturizing foundation so it
leaves your skin super flawless and
beautiful but also applies mooster into
the skin so it comes in 12 different
colors everything from like the lightest
to with the darkest really yeah amazing
we really took our time creating this
well full range of foundation and you
find that you ever need to mix two
different foundations to go together I
show you know what you find
I find that we did a really great job
the skin shades now what's really cool
is we also have this thing called flash
illuminator which is super shiny
iridescent e liquid highlighter so what
I love doing is mixing both the bomb and
the flash illuminator
to make the skin super dewy eyes really
love really Jimmy skin oh you're gonna
love this it's called flash illuminator
right okay Wow so one of my favorite
shades in morning light Wow it's like
liquid gold
super super iridescent II like on the
cheeks and the brow you professor cheesy
finger to apply it I like using my
fingers for highlighter because I feel
like you can really get into the areas
more organically gorgeous amazing so now
that you're all prepped let's start with
some brows and I love this product it's
called more than brows it's exactly what
you think it is it is a pencil powder oh
wow eyebrow pencil so you literally just
start from the inner corner of the
eyebrow shaping the brow any which way
and then you can take like a little
brush and continue to diffuse it make a
little bit more pushy so now that we got
a good base going on let's start with
some of my favorite eye products okay
now you wanted to do this like super
Kendall inspired look yes so I see in
the picture Kendall with basic very
black kind of green graphic and eyes and
a pink lips in the reader contour cheeks
the edging is called is one of my
favorite products it's a super awesome
waterproof
liner that you can use inside and
outside the eye it comes in ten
different colors for the sake of this
super smoky and edgy eye
let's do black I'm gonna take it in the
inner rim on the top and the bottom we
can take a little brush you can use
liner on shove it you can use it as a
liner I'm diffusing it to make it look a
little bit more like shadow mm-hmm
because it's an eight colors you can
literally do any sort of which I want
and do the blend relieved it together I
do
super it wasn't what's really cool is
that once you got it once you get it
smudged and blended it won't move really
so good net all night you can rock out
with your collab what's on your favorite
products other than the ones that I'm
using only there's so many that I love
you know I love the eye Kohl's I love
Natalia shadows I love that palette that
Kendall worked on it's called the STI 2
palette it's got 12 incredible shades in
it
I'll show you take a little take a
little break well really incredible
shades Wow everything from like her
favorite news and her favorite Browns to
her favorite color which is purple her
Smokies her new black so it's kind of
got like the super Kendall vibe going on
in all the colors and then we had it
these two what we call transformers Wow
so the Transformers you can apply on top
of any eye makeup that's incredible
isn't that crazy they have beautiful on
top of any makeup and what's really cool
is that they glow under the UV light you
know the blue lights in the disco the
blue lights under and at the club so if
you put this on and go clubbing your
odds are gonna be like sparkly and
shimmery and super brave Oh
and Kendall literally additives all this
and all the other products in shape
exactly all her own it's heard like spin
on like makeup and her vibe and what she
loves with makeup so once we have this
super beautiful kind of smoky eye let's
start with one of my other favorite
products which is called metallic shadow
first side is a super creamy Wow
textured cream base alright credible
then it's got this incredible powder
pigment that goes right on top of that
sparkly shiny and fun I'm gonna throw
this right on top of that and I love the
fact that it's super creamy because then
it just kind of blends yeah what I love
about this collection gonna be super
natural and super bear then you can also
be super smoked down and edgy and fun
and cool and colorful and the different
lipstick shades I'm saying I don't worry
green enough and I'm gonna really love
it what do you think what this shape
should we pull it out a little bit more
yeah let's make it more elongate it a
little longer believe it sometimes I
find my eyes look too round
so yeah that's why I always kind of
elongate them a little bit so aside from
the obvious of the beautiful palette
what else does Kendall really love
collection I feel like goatee product
well go twos are a lot of different
things you know it could be anything
from the Bears lip liner and lipstick
and so bear okay like one of our
favorite nudes and the mattified
lipsticks there's also this one color
called
killing it which is the super bright
vivid orange red look up for me that
moment I give my evening look can you
say or does she just recommend lips
whenever she like I think she's just
rocks the red lip whenever she feels
like I think when you're Kendall you can
kind of rock out anything I have to
clean you up a little bit getting a
little quickly
finally let's get the blackest liner in
here and the blackest liner is almost
like crayon liquid eyeliner and it gives
you just super high intense black lines
Wow
we show you another really cool product
alright so the edgiest up and out
mascara it's got two sides I think how
many times have you worn your Miss Kenya
like I wish that to mascara yeah so one
side didn't give you volume and the
other side it's gonna lift and curl oh
really yeah
super amazing mascara first let's start
with volume that's every lash with tons
of product
lifts and curls so now that we have the
ID um let's continue with some contour
I'm sorry it's my favorite thing we've
made it super simple one pencil okay
it's got your contour shade and it's got
your highlight shape super easy Wow so
once it's on you can just take your
fingertips or brush take a little bit of
a flash photo powder just a little bit -
photo powder is Super Bowl product it'll
blow out your skin just a little bit
making your skin look perfect for every
single selfies so fine let's add a
little bit of lip so I love this sort of
like nudie fleshy lip what do you think
