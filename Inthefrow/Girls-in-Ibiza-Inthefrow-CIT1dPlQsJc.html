good morning guys it's day three we're

incredible I got that last night I think
I forgot to vlog and see about but
anyway just got up and we're having you
get a game so it starts from yoga and
then we're gonna really chill Dave of
course my side now Theresa's going to do
a face shot on me she's like a skin care
expert
she'd open your own store soon as well
I'm not and kill which is amazes want to
go there get those treatments done
hopefully when I get back that's now
she's gonna do a facial this is my
facial skin feel so soft and right
cleanse it's so nice to kind of have it
all clean and you know I can all crap
out of it that builds up stuff so it's a
soon acta step to razor it's like a
foreign skin care expert like she really
knows his stuff when it comes to skin
care so she deserves tips and things
about how to really look after skin and
whatnot so so I tell you guys and I'll
probably do a blog post on it as well
it's really really interested in mine
find out much more about skin and how to
look after it laughs so the first thing
is SPF and her favorite is this one
conceals intra light defense
I suppose 50 me I barely ever get my
face out in the Sun anymore because I
just hate the idea of getting wrinkles
so generally I just put like an SPF on
my face such as this then I'll put a
little bit of makeup on the top and then
just wear a hat or just keep your face
out the Sun generally something like
that so I'm going to put some this on
now actually because now that I've had
so much stuff taking out my skin I'll
need something to really protect it even
long and then she also said keep it nice
and cleanse and moisturized a lot so
that your skin doesn't dry out and
whatnot and if you're someone that kind
of wears a lot of makeup a lot not just
exfoliate more so things like Cara Sonic
we've all got these kind of things with
us that declares on
brochure this really helps get all the
grit out the skin clean it and make it
softer and smoother this wouldn't suit
by the ways from a soft but it was
really cute yeah hopefully that someone
helpful all the girls are chillin over
here with all the comments yeah go go
