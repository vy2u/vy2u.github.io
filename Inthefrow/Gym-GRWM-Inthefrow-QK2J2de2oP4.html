ready with me this time for my gym
routines a lot of you might be wondering
why do I need to wear makeup at the gym
I think it's all personal preference I
prefer to wear makeup to go to the gym
because it makes me feel more confident
it makes me feel a little bit and more
alive and awake and fresh and I just
prefer to have a little bit of makeup on
when I'm looking at myself in the gym
mirrors not not too much makeup but just
enough that I feel a bit more like
myself some girls would prefer to wear
no makeup whatsoever that's great that's
your personal preference some people
would prefer to wear a full face of
makeup with eyelashes in the works again
that's completely up to you whichever
way makes you feel more confident and
more comfortable at the gym then go for
it you should just do exactly what you
want to do but with this video I didn't
want to spark any debate with people
saying oh you shouldn't be wearing
makeup at the gym or people say you
should wear more or anything like that I
just wanted to show you cuz I've got I
do when I go to gym in order to make
myself feel confident so hopefully you
enjoy this video and let's get into it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
