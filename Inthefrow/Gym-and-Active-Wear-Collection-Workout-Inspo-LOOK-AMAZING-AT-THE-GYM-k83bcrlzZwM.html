you through my gym wear collection draw
today I kind of recently organized
everything I've got a lot of different
brands that I really really love when it
comes into mind yoga wear sportswear so
it's not going to go through all my
different things that I've got recently
I've kind of really been getting into
the gym I've been trying to go as much
as possible I've been trying to go to a
different yoga classes as well and it's
really getting into it so after I'd show
you exactly what I wear when I want to
feel amazing and I want to feel like a
look good even without makeup on at the
gym so let's just get back into this I'm
going to go through this like run by
Brown because it kind of keeps it more
simple first Browns that you may not
fail because it's pretty new so it's got
some absolute favorites now and it's a
brand called Valley and they make some
really kind of more bit more sexy a bit
cutesy air pieces and the generic
sportswear styles example this sports
bras got a bit mesh in there it's got
some cool cuts out details
I really prefer wearing sports bras to
the gym because I just get so hard
busted I hate wearing things that you
tie up too clingy I just feel too hot
and I can't take off of layers so I'd
rather wear this little sports bras at
this so I can sort of sweat without
feeling like and just absolutely filing
hot so this is a piece from file leases
do this gorgeous light blue animal
prints we have the matching blue
leggings which are going to have these
really cool mesh cutouts in the legs so
I'm a huge fan of that but they also do
a marble design like a white and blue
gray marble
French I think it's pretty cool
absolutely gorgeous and they also do
snake print as well so it's really cool
snake print and at the back it kind of
ties around the very back into a
Razorback and then that's mesh here
again a bit of mesh here it's just a
little bit kind of sexier and prettier I
feel really nice when I'm wearing these
energy so if you're after something it's
a little bit cooler than the generic
valves and valley is definitely want to
go for alpha leave links down below and
I also have this valley corporate as
well there's a generic sweatshirt but I
just love throwing salt over the top of
those pieces when I go to the gym let's
take it with me next to me and then well
I'm kind of having a cool-down session
forget the chillier I'll put this on as
well
but I generally go to and from gym in
essence this is a really nice piece to
our dollar thesis so yes very big thumbs
up from May up it love them right now
around you're definitely paradoxical
sportswear engine where is sweaty Betty
and they just brought out knees brand
new like these calls the call some sort
of like gravity leggings anyway they
just kind of let me hold you in an hour
and I places so it really kind of like
help you ball nice and lifted they just
look really lovely and really flattering
on the legs we've got these great cutout
it's not really mesh this is more their
kind of sportswear technical fabric
around the back just to kind of keep to
you like sweat proof I'm sure it can
like wicking fabrics yeah I really enjoy
wearing these as well I think that's
really flattering arms are a great color
would be cool marble course or marble
kind of style going down them yes so
sexy Betty can't let me beat sweaty
Betty I think that constitutes gym wear
and thanks and I have this jumper as
well it comes with sweaty besties but I
answer in love thrown on as well it's
just at the front and longer at the back
so it's got quite cool shape when it
drapes on you and a little bit of sort
cowl-neck feature going on with a hood
it's very slouching very kind of
off-duty style and in this dark gray
charcoal it's enough feel very cool when
I wear this and it's really warm really
cozy yes so look wearing that when I
wear my sweats your best pieces I kind
of mix and match with pieces as well per
days but quite often if I'm wearing one
thing it will remind me to wear any
other thing startin where things
together like that
so yes sweaty Betty will love that too
I've got a new section Tory Burch has
just been released absolutely love these
sort of a beautiful maybe almost like an
indigo Navy shades the Tory Burch logo
and then some cool patterns and these
are also movie so they glow in the dark
so if you like a spin class or another
class that have like UV lights from
there
these will glow ups which is pretty cool
quite like that and also maybe if you
can go in for a run or if you run the
bike in these and often us very good
will show up in car lights as well again
just really really flush strings on and
that comes with a matching tops okay now
and again I will wear tops like this
quite often if I know I'm going to yoga
or something like that where I'm not
going to get be getting quiet time so I
do
to copy me up more our where things and
long-sleeve I'm usually always have a
sports threat underneath I can strip off
if I need to and this is just a really
gorgeous one again the big tory burch
sportswear logo across the front yet got
some lovely breathable fabrics down the
edges and it goes really nicely with the
Lincoln's like obviously a huge fan
maggot a lot of nights where I must
admit these kind of sports Raj
accounting to be I think I've got three
or four things in different colors and
different patterns but a little bit
really comfortable I only have very
small boobs anyway so this is kind of
perfect for me you may need a lot more
support if you've got larger boobs for
me but for me works really really well
so has that one I have this one haven't
been wrong yet
I've got this around Christmastime in
the sales and haven't really wallet
backs it love that print and this also
have brought insert so a little bit more
support and having again these are all
in the so with my lack of all knees yet
believe repairs capris I think I'm not
more than that it's been cooler so I
like wearing longer but for when I want
to be doing yoga or doing it look the
hottest film exhibition and go away and
do yoga outside and we're taking you to
admit I love this print again it's very
very similar to this is pixelated prints
but this is like on a smaller pixelated
style actually make them and that and
again it's it really nicely that make me
feel like I'm really held in and all the
right places and I also got the use as
well recently for a night which are
full-length legging nice breathable
fabric down the side and on the back of
the Commish it's got some kind of cool
cross outs to it and again it almost
reminds me of like a brief chocolate
where it's kind of like this melted
pattern but yes really comfortable again
love those a lot so I've recently got a
lot of new adidas wear love this I've
got a couple of different colors again
fits really really nice there's no
inserts in this so it's is quite
comfortable sort of smaller boobs maybe
so like that laughs I have these
leggings in the black that go with those
so nicely and gorgeous mesh so I could
coral mesh panel down each side so to do
this down a leg you know there's very
comfortable very easy to wear I quite
often wear these as well when I'm going
long-haul flights because it's super
comfortable with the big wave brands so
they look great together that another
flower cover up like a real love adjust
these long vets like very drop arm hell
they're super breathable is very
lightweight for those days when you've
kind of got a lot to eat the day before
assume it bloated you don't really want
to wear sports for all the time and
they're not many people feel that
comfortable just wearing support for us
so quite often our cover up with
something like this this I still feel
quite breathable this needs a good wash
Ashley it's got a little bit makeup on
it now but yes this just fits really
nicely so super lightweight are in let
me try on it first and worry about over
the top and then terminators full set I
also have with God's kind of like
climate control quite warm throw over
the top so this just zips up the
neckline all black abuse logo you know
super simple but it just kind of keeps
you super warm and it took nice one to
throw off with the whole set like a full
black outfit that's very stylish very
chic and I feel really really great when
I'm wearing since at that so big thumbs
up
I've also got some night trees these are
the night running trainers I actually
got these when I went to Chicago from a
Nordstrom and through like the pattern
on them well yeah they're really
comfortable that's an easy one to kind
of run the treadmills in go on the cross
trainer in I mean and your personal run
outside so it's obviously if you're
doing that and you're doing things a bit
more specialist then I would ask in a
store across the list for shoes because
I can't really give you an advice on
what type of shoes to wear to your type
of sport but if you kind of go to the
gym like I do and you'll be doing any
really exertive sports then these are
really really great sorry like those a
lot things I've doesn't often mentioned
beautiful also mention my new adidas
ultra boost which are my absolute
favorites right now super comfortable I
almost feel like sock material when you
put them on it's kind of fit for Ronnie
feet they're just very simple but quite
chic easy to wear white and black
everything's a black and white on these
it was very very comfortable very wise
button to get a lot of contact with the
floor it's very comfortable so I love
these two bits at the moment which is my
whole like the news out that these go
extremely well so a big fan and I also
just got these I mean how cool are these
Ron take a lavender gray doodle some APM
again very comfortable I think you could
probably wear these thought variety of
different types of sports in the gym
again I
would undo my research into if you are
more into your running and things but if
you just go into gym and you go into
classes these are great I wore the use
of the day for a hit class and they were
perfect and I'm going to do wearing and
sodium as well I just a few extra pieces
as well that I want to mention I really
really love right now this gorgeous
sports rather from LMD are all gray
lovely navy detailing
Navy print Navy edges today and it just
fits really really nicely it kept me
really kept in and this is an extra
small and that's my size so that might
probably recommend to go for yeah it's
small yeah I felt really secure in this
and it's fit really beautifully so I
love that largely and again because with
the blue detailing it goes so well with
the toy Burch leggings which is how I
wear it and last few pieces are from the
brand new victoria's secret sports range
Victoria's bought this top especially I
love I love the fact that it has my
name's to it across the front of it it
might have another top very similar to
this one from Victoria Secret as well
again it's just very nice to throw on
rather than just a really simple bar
invest if you just want to kind of look
a bit more chic at the gyms add a little
knot details in the back kind of nice
you know looking lightweight fabric so
that's really cute also the Victoria's
Secret some are like yogurt leggings so
there's more of a coffee material
perfect for throwing over the top of
leggings on my way to the gym for my
walk so Jen feels relieved over the top
but it's really really comfortable but
after the go if you're doing some yoga
as well you want some kind of sticking
yoga leggings a bit warmer maybe if
you're a bit cold in your gym or
anything like that or if you're working
out at home these are the gray out of
statue that you're going these at home
yeah this is fit really nicely and I
really like the whole bit Tori spot logo
going on and also I mean this is one for
the very brave but this is also a
victorious sports bra as well which
looks great just underneath this as well
this is a small sports bra it's very
kind of Cikini style it's got these
really simple bands in the back
perfect for if you go away on holiday
maybe if you're working out on the beach
things like that maybe for an LA and
you've got Sony around you want
something a little bit smaller and
you're very confident with your body's
response is very brave and very
confident with the body really but I
just think it's gorgeous especially this
kind of hidden under this it's just that
little extra which is great I'm really
good too because I also have two more
pieces on the way to me
Mazzoni hopefully as one and by the time
this video goes up second kind of
abdomen but we're not here right now for
my filming and their brand new
collection with my Theresa with my Sony
and they're amazing super bright
colorful very different terracing I've
got here and I really want to show you
but yeah hope I can insert some footage
so you can see me wearing those in flap
but that is all of my collection that's
a lot of spots where I realize but all
my favorite brands falater's Edith
Victoria Secret new Tory Burch range is
amazing night obviously yeah so I hope
this can we give you a bit of info if
you're going to the gym site the gym for
new honestly when it comes to me going
to the gym if I have some really great
sportswear to go in it really motivates
me more I know it's nothing to do the
clothes that you're wearing but
sometimes it's nice to feel like you
look a little bit better especially
we've got no makeup down your hairs it's
a bit of a mess most women that I know
would agree was made that they like to
wear things that generally feel quite
confident in or flatter their figure
just so they feel a little bit more pull
together a bit more like themselves when
they're in kind of a lot uncomfortable
environment again so for me wear
anything that I really love and feel
more confident in really makes a big
difference to how I feel about the gym
and when I buy a new piece it also
motivates me to go to the gym again I'm
gonna wear this my try out you know so
it's kind of it kind of works really
really well so I hope you some in sperm
and some new brands we found that you
never seen before
