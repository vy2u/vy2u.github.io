jelly kind of substance you can kind of
see a jelly it's just so nourishing but
I've just been playing around with
recently this DCL seascape high-potency

it on again tonight and let you know in
the morning kind of how my skin is
feeling and then we can count just it

damn great today actually the sort of
plunk I can still feel the sort of
almost like the residue of the vitamin C
all over my face so it still feels like
super like I don't know what it is it's
not sticky or tacky it's if i can it's
almost like an oil residue almost you
can just feel on it's just still feels
