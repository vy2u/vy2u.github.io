really well seeing as it's been a while
since we kind of spoke like chilled
face-to-face since my last video which i
think was like three months ago now I
kind of want to do like another update
video to really enjoyed film up video I
felt like it was menu certain area
Mohamed she'll and like a really good
catch up so I'm back again with McAfee
Alex made of smooth shot of espresso of
vanilla Nespresso topped up with soy
milk with ice cube and one teaspoon of
agave syrup really enjoying it nice like
iced coffee for the mornin yeah I really
really enjoyed that last video cuz it
was nice chatting and it was nice to
kind of get a lot of things off my chest
and I kind of like to do a bit of an
update of that and things that I
mentioned in that video and what's going
on now cuz well it's been quite a bit
time so yes that's what I'm going to be
doing here let's try just chatting for a
little bit so I'm really should have
made note of what to say okay first
thing to mention from the last video
I'll talk about the fact that I would
love to get engaged this year and I'm
guessing that a few people can have
watched a bit of a video didn't watch
all of it and therefore from me talking
about the fact that it would be nice for
Alex to propose at some point a few
people thought we'd actually got engaged
so I've had people come up to me and be
like oh my god congratulations and like
on what as you hopefully know what I've
done I think a couple of brands also
sent me some lovely gifts like really
little gifts but to say congratulations
on your engagement and like I haven't
one gauge sure so some of the guaranty
climax for the time when it might happen
but I saw was quite funny so just so you
know we're not engaged yet I'd like to
be engaged at some point this year or
early next year who knows it's more that
I was mentioned the fact that I feel
ready now to be proposed to whereas last
year I was current now jet really want
to get married and I mean I'm not the
biggest fan of marriage anyway but I've
got the pot now I'm like yeah I could
let it happen so that's that's the deal
and I also will say I kind of mentioned
in my last video that a lot of you guys
commented on with Alice mentioning that
I was kind of trying to plump this guy
out I'd like to try it the more for kind
of dietary reasons to see if it would
help with my bloating issues vanilla
that's a lot of ladies out there and
guys to get rid of a bloated
from certain types of food and I kind of
wanted to cut out some things to see
what it may have been turns out is milk
milk really really floats me southern
cook now big time I don't touch any
other dairy cheese
I've been holding off as much as
physically possible might and that is a
big deal I'm a big big fan of cheese and
if you've seen Alex a slog that is
coming out with oh it may not be out yet
or it may be if it is out I forget on
the screen here if not he'll be out soon
and there's a moment where he was
recording me looking at cheese board
that was in front of me I didn't realize
he was recording it completely genuine
and I just have this break to help over
the fact that I can't eat this cheese
but I know it makes me feel awful and
totally rubbish or the completely honest
has been the odd time we're had like a
pasta dish it's been mainly spinach to
the tan but cheese that's been okay and
it's because I've been away somewhere in
Italy and I'm like you know what I want
to live my life I want to enjoy my life
today I want to have a lot less ricotta
in my pasta but generally I've been
cutting it out and feeling really really
good for it so I need to carry on with
that I've also now started having fish
again because I miss fish I really
really love fish so I've been having
some fish but in terms of me that's just
a noise I don't think I'm ever going to
go back to me ever again it's been like
over a year and a half now without me
and I really like it so that's just
waited for me and everyone's day is
different but just so you know in case
you ever see me out in a brow and I'm
eating a piece of fish I like I thought
she wasn't eating fish just so you know
that's that's got going on there I'm
it's April now and I feel like this
whole years of our four months has been
a complete and utter blur like it sounds
like last year I've done so much by this
time last year I kind of don't feel like
I've done anything but they're not
thinking about it I had I feel like
February was just a blur with the
entirety of fashion we like New York
London Milan Paris that was just such a
mind who why it was so much work a lot
of some place to see a lot of people to
me and I feel like my mind is shut off
like mom it's just a bit like wow Dobler
so much you should all what going to
happen there but I know it was really
amazing I saw some incredible shows and
now it's the Dior show it was to
streaming it was a real like career
highlight thing and it was an amazing
month so I thought that was a blur and
then January I did a few things went up
to Lake Tahoe skiing
which was insane but yeah you know just
feel like I'm not done that much yet I
feel like I can if I'm still waiting to
get into a big real of different things
going on like tomorrow I'm going know in
a few days and go to Tuscany with Alex
on like a spa break fit loads and
amazing pictures hopefully so hopefully
you've seen them on Instagram if not
I'll leave my Instagram somewhere links
you can go have Pete so that's exciting
I've got a few other trips coming up
we're going to Cuba with Colleen Leon
and virgin holidays I'm going to Paris
with a few friends for a birthday and
going to Cannes Film Festival with
L'Oreal so the few things kind of coming
up which will be really cool and I can't
wait so yeah called out those to cut
like to share that with you guys to all
the big news I'm pretty excited about is
that I'm getting my braces off soon
I feel like recently my Lisp has got
worse don't know why that is if it's
because my teeth have finally moved into
where they're going to be staying now
I'm not sure but I do feel like my Lisp
list is a little bit worse than it was
my exes are so annoying but I should
hopefully hopefully new it into my
treatment now really really really happy
with the results I mean the amount of my
friends now that say I don't even what
your teeth were like before I'm sure
they were fine before so don't see the
difference but like if you go back to
like my videos pre January 2016
if you go back to like December 2015 the
change in my teeth is massive like
totally massive I'm a front teeth but
kind of skew with and one was longer
than the other and the bottom teeth were
kind of a little bit out of sync and
literally like my entire top row as we
move around and put on level I'm so
happy with it
I've been seeing it's an incredible
dentists well orthodontists called a
thief's a tube and he's wonderful and
he's most calm chilled out guys really
really lovely and he's just so is such
an expert in why does and he put on a
set of lingual braces for me so you're
not been here before and I've spoken
much before but yeah it's like train
tracks that you get on front of your
teeth puts on the back and just it is
for aesthetic reasons because I bought
them on the front again I went through
four years of having on the front of my
teeth back when a younger I don't wear
my retainers wear your retainers people
and
yeah my tease went back out of shape
again so she's been on the back of my
teeth and it's been amazing and so happy
with transformation I can't recommend
anymore I'll leave his details down
below he's at the London lingual
orthodontics linic it's on Wimpole
Street just off it's right near Hollow
Street in London honestly I can't
recommend more if you're looking for
something for your teeth and you really
want to try something known then
honestly give it a go it's completely
different to Invisalign so many people
say everything goes like it's completely
different it's not like that at all a
completely static in our mouth they
don't come out they are fastened on to
my teeth like four it's like full-on
train tracks but on the back of my teeth
and I'll be doing probably a video at
the end when they're all done to show
you before and afters and to tell you
more about the process because it's
honestly been like a bit of a life
changes for me I'm just so so happy I
feel like I can smile properly again I
was really unconfident around the time I
file I went through with getting them
done so yeah really with you happy yes
so that's just a big change in my life
at the moment and generally I'm really
really happy I think the only thing
that's getting me down at the moment is
that I don't feel I have enough time to
blog as much as I like to so if you
didn't know first and foremost I am a
fashion blogger that's kind of how I
actually start as the beauty vlogger and
then became more of a fashion blogger my
blog is like my Fang and I love it so
much so if you're not seeing it just in
the fro calm and yeah recently I feel
like I'm not getting as much content out
there for you guys so I'm going to try
and work on that again getting a bit
more out there recently I've missed a
few videos as well because I've been
toying with just doing maybe one video a
week that's something I want to try
Instagram live I'm going to do one today
I think I've done this just as I was
going to write out it's not tried it yet
I need to do that need to do it so I'm
going to do that I feel like more people
now know what they like to watch so they
watch less different types of videos and
more of the same kind of video cuz it's
fair for me I'm not watching us watch
YouTube as I did I am still someone who
watches a lot of YouTube okay so
whenever I'm doing my makeup if I'm take
off my makeup if I'm cooking if I am
timing if I'm better than morning
alright now I would watch YouTube videos
is to kind of like chill but even I am
kind of being less interested in the
things that I'm seeing in my suits boxes
I don't know why it's just I kind of
feel like everyone's in that kind of
place so so again as love your and
on this bike what do you like to send me
to do what would you like me to do more
of what do you like to see the most and
what could I maybe do different I'd love
to hear your advice on it again at the
great but when it comes to the blog I
love that the blog is kind of like my
own space there's no one else kind of in
that space and I can kind of write about
anything I'm thinking and feeling that
day and that's what I really like about
it so I'm just going to continue with
that and try and see where I get to with
that so yeah how much is a blog if
you've not seen it before and that would
be racing I feel a compliment greats
recently to say hey to you guys because
