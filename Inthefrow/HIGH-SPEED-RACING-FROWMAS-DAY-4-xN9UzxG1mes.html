very excited today because they get to
drive the car like I said I haven't
driven in four years maybe five years
it's been a while so I've got some flat
shoes because I don't think my Dolce for
work today

Jaeger knit top I've worn it to us and
then these jeans are my seventh all
mankind once I also wear every single
day I love them and I'm gonna wear like
I said I'm gonna wear my favorite doe
Ginga Borobudur I just didn't do a
makeup I'm watching Carly Rowena if you
don't feel like Carly already I love her
she's not one of my besties we're going
snowboarding next week really really
excited about that that is gonna be so I
was over talking so when you're saying
we're going through all the dates of
December and I realized that vogner my
froman's
should actually be quite eventful
because I've got to this I've got a big
like friend thing coming up on a weekend
I've got the ski trip I've got a few of
the big meetings and things going on so
hopefully you won't get too bored this
week I'm so green in here yeah
yes I've just been getting nothing
getting ready watching a bit everywhere
you know and yeah I need to I need to
leave I have one minute to leave so I'll
see you hopefully around the test track
we just got a local team shark and it's
kind of like a secret location and it's
where they test all the cars out on
other looks insane elections expecting a
little white round trout
and it's literally like this like side
bits where the car goes all right look
it moves and I'm 6/8 and also they're
just lined up all the different cars
rather close outside and now I think
I've talked before I love with the navy
blue color our Nevada bridge had one of
these pretzels this is one salty tasty
pretzel and Nicole agrees it's good try
not to choke on it like gosh there
remember one bus choked on a pretzel in
about ten minutes from going out I'm
going out for you dripping around you're
on the first track and then I come back
and then I'm going on the same track and
then I get to drive good but it just
shakes I'm not allowed to take my camera
in there with me when I'm driving what
you'll just have to see the footage when
the videos come and they'll be in there
one so in natural videos come out by box
something will be able to see me in the
car driving going out why is it raining
why didn't have to rain this is quite
cute and all right we're in the car
recording as well
yep you know what you do there's gonna
be so much fun
this is gonna be great footage travel
around like this with you guys it's
about to go off on the second test track
which is the what they call the
performance right yes if the racetrack
in YouTube performance party and ignore
you
oh that's really nice isn't it so I'm
gonna go really fast
yeah yes yes with the bricks in this car
so we're gonna head out no this is gonna
be hilarious so we're on the track now
second breaking very late
the calyx is brilliantly on that
condition it's really slippery now - you
were in the coma zone yes so I get to
drive this one in a minute this is the
color I love the Mouser thinks it looks
like it looks like an indigo blue that
looks almost perfectly doesn't know look
I love it with the white like how nice
is it with the white just come out from
driving my car I was actually pretty
good actually and quite pleased myself
although at first I wasn't sure why the
handbrake was on our off wasn't even
right and the car wasn't even but it's
cuz the clutch was really hello but it
was so fun and that is a wrap on the day
the day is over
we're gonna get back now to the airport
and get back home and we're hoping us
somewhere to get hot chocolate
I don't really really craving hot
chocolate
back home that was one hell of a cab
ride it hooked a display about an hour
and a half finally got home it although
I do care let us cab genex because it
means I can ring people on them so I
rang my dad for sure I rang my mom for a
chat this is my crazy but it looks a bit
like to know that character on
hocus-pocus who has the crazy hair a
little bit like her but you know those
days when I get any on I put your hair
up
that just happened let's just go in look
what I've just had delivered Lola's
cupcakes for tomorrow I'm going back to
Manchester and I wanted to take
something back with me so I've got some
Lola's cupcakes take back and these are
the Christmas versions check that out oh
oh it's like sticky so that's like a
popcorn one
so truffle they look so delish I've been
home a couple of hours and I've just
been cleaning and cleaning and tidying
I've got the dishwasher no washing
machine on I've got the dishwasher all
set
thrown away boxes and boxes of stuff
into the big bins might be cycling and I
put all the boxes clothes away so the
place is looking far better now than it
was which is much better I'm just so
much more relaxed but it now means that
it's like half eight doesn't like two
hours doing that so I'm gonna try and
watch some thin on the TV and get a blog
post and I'm gonna try and do I'm gonna
try and write about my Iceland trip my
license Paula did that went on last week
so if you're interested in Iceland I'm
gonna have done a blog post about the
sites and where we stayed and what I
think we should do and what I think
should wear and kind of like a guide to
it so if you're interested I'll leave
the link down below to my blog thank you
