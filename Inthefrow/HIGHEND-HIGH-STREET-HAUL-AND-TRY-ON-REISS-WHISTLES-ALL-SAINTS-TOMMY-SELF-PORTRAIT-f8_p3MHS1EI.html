till this is going to be a massive upper
high street hall we're talking the
stores that are in the middle of the
high streets who Topshop hmm just above
those and not quite luxury but right
there in the middle with better quality
I think more unique designs designs that
you happen to see else many people
wearing and that's why I really really
like them so in here we've got recent
got whistles got Tommy self-portrait Ted
Baker all sane and meetin em so I've got
seven different brands here to show you
when you get right into it there's a lot
to go through
but generally I want to find all the
best things right now to sum up from all
of these stores for me from my wardrobe
and also for your let's get into it
right let's kick I've literally got all
the clothes I'm going to kick this off
straight off with what is on my right
starting off from Rhys I thought this
blouse is beautiful it's a gorgeous kind
of creepy fabric with these very
lustrous threads going through it just
add a little bit more I hope you can see
that kind of illuminating in the
lighting just a very beautiful design
this collar is really high and then
folds over for cute little high neck
feature no sleeves so it's perfect for
summer great took in too short of a
skirt or even a pair of jeans sort of
beautiful then from Rhys these shorts
would work perfectly with that white top
they're just a really great pair of kind
of a thick cotton shorts they are in
like a dark navy too little buttons on
the front which I felt a quite cute
detail is it to the side and they're
really great lengths like they don't
skin the bomb the really great
flattering mature very wearable length
could wear these kind of dress still or
you could dress them down that's why I
really like them and if and if you
watched my clear-out video where I was
going through my suede jacket selection
and keeping many of them let's just say
I've got another suede jacket now from
Rhys and this is so beautiful it's like
a blush pink I don't have a blush pink
jacket like this but I find these three
jackets are so good to throw on with
most outfit especially on quite casually
like a white tee and jeans something
like this to throw over the top keeps
you warm I mean it might quite warm at
the moment with the London weather being
so hot but generally it just kind of
keeps a bit warm at what also looking
super stylish
pulled together and this is a beautiful
beautiful option from Rhys I love that a
lot and a half of spell details as well
beautiful and another piece of clothing
from reset picked up was this one again
with the Nestle love but high neck but
I'm sorry it's really quite
sophisticated the way it is it's a bit
of an it or isn't it so it doesn't feel
like wall it feels like a very like
cottony so it's a bit more kind of
slinky and is quite flattering on and
again it's very me more kind of like to
night Karen's very nice noodle with a
pair of shorts or whatnot they'll be a
little bit thicker so with more cooler
nights I'd wear this and I probably
wouldn't take you on holiday with me but
for cooler nights and the summer I will
love to wear that ok Tommy Hilfiger this
shirt oh my god this shirt is so me I've
got a very similar shirt actually from
another brand from Jack Wills but this
is even more perfect to me it's a
pinstripe I hope you can really see that
click are a little Thai flag here and in
a Thomas store they now do
personalization so it's some per
scientist p.m. on the back love this so
much it's just so me perfectly nice
shirt to throw on if you want to wear a
pair of shorts and took it in and you
look a little bit more sophisticated and
pull together where you still want to
get your legs out beautiful love it and
this piece I can't even tell you how
amazing this Jenin jacket is this is
from the Tommy Hilfiger collection again
just how cute is it it's just got some
kind of like Western vibes
it's got patches it's got distressing
it's so sweet I absolutely fell in love
with this when I saw it the inside of
this collar just sings to me I love it I
always put my collar so just nice to
have that color kind of popping out but
the best thing about it is the back
piece which again has been embroidered
with V M so massive thank you to the
time team for this because I didn't
expect it at all but this is so awesome
alex is so jealous you'll absolutely
love this as well I cannot wait to wear
this more summer I think it's just
seriously amazing next is a brand called
mean M I feel it's a little less known
what the things they sell in there is a
lot of silks a lot of very beautiful
fabrics very feminine I really love what
they put together so from there you
might recognize the shirt
had this shirt about six months ago and
I unfortunately got a thing on it and
totally ruined it but I wore it so much
back then but I wanted another one
absolute door this so much I love to
wear this over like a little pair of
shorts sticking out at the bottom have
also took this into skirts as well
it's just absolutely beautiful it's the
most incredible silky fabric honestly
it's the quality is like superb superb
this top as well is so me and again the
most beautiful I think is a cotton but
it's absolutely stunning on fabrics our
next level beautiful bread brown glaze
to the throat panels
it's got a very Victoriana by with this
slight rustle hem collar but when it's
open it's just such a beautiful and it's
got these mid sleeves with course I
think I can't get over the quality of
these pieces so absolutely beautiful
this pair of trousers are so cool
because you remind me a little bit of
like the 90s but with a very kind of
modern take very mature much more
sophisticated these I'm gonna wear with
a pair of nude heels or a pair of very
pointed dark blue or black heels like
stilettos I think this is so cool with
this elasticated waist line and they've
got the drawstring to pull them in for a
little bit more figure but they actually
fits so wonderfully honestly they're
just again in seeing quality I cannot
wait to wear those for you to mention
from self portrait because I can't do
another high-street kind of feel whole
without mentioning my face you may have
seen this in my Mexico haul but I
mention it quickly again because it's
just a classic design from self-portrait
I brought it back and the back in stock
and I should get one in flew certainly
cause this it's an absolute winner if
you're going to weddings this season or
if you're going to different events
using a little bit more dressy adults
think you can go wrong with a
self-portrait
if you don't want to go for a dress no
totally love this shirt well this blouse
it's so beautiful so much texture on
here ruffles cutout work lacing it's
just yeah absolutely beautiful and I get
so many compliments whenever I wear this
so that's just a bit of an alternative
that also does come in a dress and my
director might be on Instagram and I
recently wore I am obsessed with this
color I could show you red it's not
perfect
with cherry red it's extremely
flattering it's not like a mini dress
style so it cooks here and then the lace
continues down the leg for more of a
midi dress feel and it's just absolutely
beautiful again a great kind of wedding
outfit great one for any hen parties you
might going on I absolutely adore that
so much I've got such a pile going on
here now I'll quickly mention this
seeing as it's the only one I have
what could they care you may have seen
this in my recent vlog really hope
you're enjoying my vlogs by the way so
many of you are so so please ellee's
more link down below cannot see them
already but this is what I wore at
Carly's wedding and it's my favorite
thing right now some to a baker I think
it's absolute beautiful I love jumpsuit
I loved her Baker's jumpsuits the
quality is stunning and it goes down
into these wide leg pants with this
pencil print design and a cute bow to
the very center for you in again I loved
wearing that to the wedding I thought it
was perfect for the occasion okay we've
got two more rounds to go try it I'm
trying to keep this short and sweet
house and completely notice I'm talking
extremely quickly okay let's go into
what all things are absolute favorites
they've been killing it - the past few
seasons so these are my favorite things
that I found on the website first up
this top it also comes in a dress which
is beautiful honestly but it was sold
out in my size so I went to the top
instead and again the quality of
beautiful is quite thick fabric here the
lace over the top of a very light kind
of tulle fabric but it just gives it
quite a lot of structure in the end
again measure the very top here I mean
you know me I love these high neck very
Victoriana inspired feel thought very
cute scene also quite feminine and
modern and you can't beat a good black
top that I can wear or can dress it down
as well then tomorrow Saint I spotted
this skirt and so it's kind of cool with
this design on the side so it's quite
different it's a little bit rock and
roll about it or the quite like to a
little bit of stressing I love the
longer length the longer length is what
drew me to this and it is a great length
it doesn't also slide up you it just
really kind of hugs you around stays
port doesn't start rising up every time
you start walking in it and yeah it's a
great length so it's not too short at
all so that's a great one for summer
actually
Kieran goes for short so I found the
eze I think these are so beautiful and
again something you could dress up and
down so easily the way they have this
style to my website is with a blazer and
little top tucked in like a lacy top and
it looks so sophisticated so feminine I
love the lace detail community that lace
detail around the bottom because
otherwise this is very kind of a creepy
fabric but goes down into the lace to
give it that very feminine feel and they
just fit extremely nicely so can't wait
to wear those from office summer
holidays I also got a new pair of jeans
from All Saints I do like the old suits
jeans I love this color
they're almost like a very blue tone
gray and they have some quirks to your
knees and it's a bit of a shorter length
as well so and all about that this is a
cropped slashed jeans and I got these in
my usual 25 length and 25 sides I'm not
trying too long yet so you can see those
in cutaways how they fit and the last
thing I'm very excited about from All
Saints is this bomber jacket now I love
wearing bomber jackets when I go away on
the plane there was a really good piece
to wear in the airport on the plane to
keep you warmer I like that more preppy
style this is so gorgeous I love it it's
a gorgeous suede to the back and to the
panels the rest is like a satin feel and
this is a cotton on the top so it's
quite sports look see if it goes around
the core and the very bottom the jacket
too but then the slave is throughout and
I just think it's absolute gorgeous I
mean look at that color though oh sorry
about this files get a bit ridiculous
okay and the last door we have to talk
about in whistles so first type of fan
of whistles absolutely love this again
it's this style again I know it's a bit
ridiculous I have so many of these but
this also fits so well it's a beautiful
very silky fabric beautiful quality what
understands our affront it's a great
length it could wear this out over short
so you could even just tuck it in and I
think how must be tucking it in with a
pair of shorts love that I tried on 85%
of everything here yesterday for Alex so
kind of know a lot about the fit all I
did with four eyes and try them on for
you guys I'm smitten with everything
else I'm just so excited about this
whole this dress is stunning it's
assuming you know me I love the cutout
work in the detail and the broad runways
and the lace work and everything it's
stunning
Scott is it
to get you in at the side and it just
goes up into more of a shift shape at
the very top and around the neck and it
kind of slaves out a little bit with the
skirt at the very bottom which I don't
usually go for because I don't use a
seat me well this looks beautiful on I'm
a big fan another piece I got from
whistles is this pair of trousers I have
this pair trout is already in blue with
the white stripes down the side which I
have literally worn to death so I'm very
sorry if you've had too much of that but
I adored the fit so much of those
trousers but I thought I'd get them in
black because black pair of trousers
always a great status how many wardrobes
just set any really really like formal
events that might be happening and I
thought well I actually love to sit at
the blue ones I'd like to get something
black so I did so I got those I don't
think you can still get the blue ones
I'll leave them linked if you can but I
think they've pretty much sold out
everywhere and the last piece and
whistles which is an absolute winner I
think I'm going to wear this for the
gleam summer party this year because
we're having a bit of a glass stove
theme kind of very outdoor festival vibe
so I thought this would work perfectly
and it's this dress for myself it's a
full maxi it's very long I'm putting
some big wedges to get me off the ground
in this I mean look at the color though
it's stunning I don't have anything like
this it's a black with the flowers and
floral prints and the leaves all over it
so the very middle is cut out those sure
little bits get in there and it has the
same detail everywhere else but with a
black backing just beneath it goes down
to full maxi it's absolutely beautiful
and yes smitten with that oh and also
just in case anyone was wondering this
finally showed up for me this is a
Victoria Beckham and Target collection
ship I ordered a few things totally
upset to them I shown a few miles piece
actually in as well coming up soon so
public for that see what else I got from
this collection but I love it so I
thought I'd wear it today
I love these costs
but if everything goes for this huge
haul and really really hope you enjoyed
this so much fun filming it honestly I'm
smitten with every single piece of god I
feel looks like the best haul I've ever
done so I really hope it's giving you
some inspiration for your own wardrobes
over summer if you're really into the
more kind of my
two categories and a lot of my friends

lot of you guys are as well and you
