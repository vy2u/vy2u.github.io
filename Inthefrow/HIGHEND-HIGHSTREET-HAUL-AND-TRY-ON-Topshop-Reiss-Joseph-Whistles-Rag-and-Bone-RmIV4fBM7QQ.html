background I'll be completely honest I
got a little bit sick of seeing my white
hair light skin and cream wall and then
white balance needed something to bridge
up a little bit so want something a bit
twinkly and cute I hope you like it I
quite like it this is a little bit more
going on in the background so yes that's
first things first everything this is a
brand new hole and I'm actually really
really excited about this if you follow
my snapshot in the throw you'll have
seen me yesterday talking about the fact
that I'm filming this video today we
night went out yesterday we did no joke
guys we went everywhere we went to all
the different high speed stores can they
always to film a high street hall so
let's go to all the medicines favorite
high street from Topshop kind of level
Haitian and Topshop up to kind of offer
and high street so still our high street
there's nothing technically luxury in
this video because and honestly those
are my kind of favorite brands those
kind of mid market rounds like reefs
with saw Joseph especially I love Joseph
and then knit wear those kilograms I
really really love I mean I feel at that
kind of area of brands do so well just
from the very kind of modern woman's
Fisk a woman who likes to look
incredible every single day just with
something that's a little bit higher
quality something that you can't
typically get from the lower end high
street necessarily so that's why relaxed
brown so I wanted to kind of show you
guys with more of these and I've seen
quite a lot of comments from you guys
asking for this kind of haul something
that's not quite off a little bit more
kind of higher end high street so this
is it yeah like I said we went
everywhere and I've been extremely
inspired by it was January and it's
December and the new season will be
showing in February from Colonel van
Eyck anaphor I'm in this limbo of I'm
not sure what I want to wear how I look
I want to take my style for this year so
I really just needed a completely
inspiring moment and that was me going
out into the stores actually looking at
everything and honestly I bought a few
pieces and those pieces really think I
really saw unlike which should I pick it
wanting top shops because that's the
only thing I really liked
right now I don't know what's going on
with my mind but there's a few things
that really stood out to me and that's
what it's all about a little bit more
kind of special to me because everything
is just I love everything as it took
yesterday so let's just get right into
it I'm going to kick this off with
whistles and I sort of go into whistles
as much as I used to anymore if I ever
buy anything up whistles it's quite
often on a song but I thought this loud
this is very made for some carrier which
I show Daleks in Atlanta to get up you
to a tee very pretty sure it's gorgeous
white so many different types of lace
and broderie anglaise gone all over this
thing it's stunning it's really quite
intricate and beautiful very delicate
and just very very me this area here
from kind of the top your boobs down is
covered by a second layer of fabric so
you have to worry about kind of new
Brown I think showing through which I
really like it kind of skims the midriff
so it's quite flattering length and
really pretty
coughs that make it a little bit tight
around your wrists so it just kind of
pulls everything together
lace is going nowhere from my wardrobe
guys I'll have you know oh my gosh this
piece I cannot tell you how much I love
this skirt this is from Reese's new
collection because you're not nothing at
the moment the sales are everywhere and
I can't shop in sales through this make
me feel really panicked everything looks
a mess I'm totally inspired I fail if I
do sales I do them online something
looks nicer than all these horrible
racks where nothing is in stories and
nothing's color-coded it just a bit of a
jumble
so anyway the new collections coming in
and that's why they're very few and far
between and as many pieces in the new
collections coming out quite yet but
this piece Reese is in their new
collection it's on the website now and
straight away I mean look at this color
look let's go up this is like one of my
favorite favorite course it's probably
one of my favorite colors now forest
green is my bag I love it and it is such
an underrated cooler it's so easy to
wear it's kind of like black and navy
but with just a little edge of color
preserves you know not everyone wearing
green but a forest green anyone could
wear and it's so super easy I could wear
it perfectly with this arm on top that
I'm wearing and it would be an amazing
to go with this because like Rick I mean
well can you do it can you get cream you
can do white you could do business it
just will go with so so many things and
it's beautiful designed yeah you could
wear it with tights a lot of people
always comment on - around like aren't
you cold
why aren't you wearing tights you know
me well you'll know and really not that
fond on tight I don't know this and just
never really light types so this I will
wear a bell eggs and usually knee-high
boots and it will look amazing I cannot
wait to wear it I think it's beautiful
job ok Topshop this is a piece that I
found that I mentioned very ivory
White's a jumper but a really pretty net
it's a round neck I don't get as many
round necks which is where I liked it
and the main thing I liked about it at
the time
- each side of the waist now after going
around every shot literally every shots
yesterday this is a big trend this
season it really many years these little
ties everywhere I've got another job to
show you perhaps it'll add alpha have
ties but they have ties it was really I
mean I listen about it it can first
expound first of all it just has a
little bit of a trend element involved
in it but in a really beautiful way is
very wearable way and it just kind of
hung out to me so on it you can try this
on I knew it was fit I knew it look
lovely and picked it up I've got Alex
from sofa in Topshop that I've left in
mouths half an hour and kind of bought
it and loved it and the fact it's got
these larger more kind of wide sleeves
as well just as a touch of a different
shapes of it being a very generic jumper
style I thought that was really
beautiful I can't wait to weather and in
fact again this skirt with this jumper
with me dream this get with this shirt
would be a dream I think you might
understand my love of skirt very I'm
going to mention these boots as well I
didn't get Lisa's today's well I got
these common weeks ago they're one of my
kind of newest purchases of me and I
didn't mention any recent haul but
they're kind of one of the main things
when you're wearing this season really
because what kind of wanted to mention
them and they're just a Stuart Weitzman
boots and I bought these recently in
this color which is can the lightest
color do a more of a light gray shade
and a reason I bought these could I have
the darker grey blue which are great for
darker outfit
and I wanted to brighten it with break
up the color so I'm not completely
wearing darker shades throughout and
this
perfect as a little bit of a lighter
color if you want to wear a black dress
or a dark green dress for example so
again these will look so nice with that
green skirt let me absolutely anything
so these are definitely kind of a big
thing again this season
I really rub the old knee boots for last
season but honestly and bringing it
through into January February March and
as long as I can possibly do so but okay
the next piece actually is a brand I
just discovered and this is on a high
street against weaker upper end high
street very weak Joseph v which is why I
really adore it and you may since in my
last video and it's a gorgeous long line
white it's a beautiful white silk one
more ivory sheer dress I really wanted
to whether to the shirt dress again with
kind of boots it would have been up to
beautiful but honestly there is a slit
just to the side which makes this
unwearable out a skirt unfortunately so
I have been tucking it in took it into
my beige suede girl be talking it into
the green skirt what the quality is
absolutely beautiful I'm a service silk
stunning and it's just very me I just
love this very kind of modern chic
tailoring like that is kind of myself or
to really if I could choose one style to
wear always it would be this very chic
modern tailoring style and I just want
to mention exits of absolute useful okay
I will show you another pitch if I made
this from Joseph actually got it from
the soft scholars have found this jumper
in Joseph and it's an absolute dream
it's a cashmere jumper it's v-neck again
I bear little wavy neck and that's why I
thought this season should have always
been about this high neck I mean I'm
always going to be able to do it Mac but
the v-neck I thought kind of brings into
wardrobe it also allows me to wear more
jewelry akai most beautiful necklace so
much more if I wear v-necks what the
quality of this is stunning
and again the thing I really love about
it in fact about is her on my round
science to me I think I really look at
it again this is ty detail so at the
very back kind with this black ribbon
and it does kind together so you would
have this loose set and have it a bit
more kind of off shoulder you could have
this kind of tied to it pulls it in a
little bit marks but like I said this
whole time is that if you go around the
shop soon you'll see it's on everything
but I just thought this was done in a
very v Kate way and extremely wearable
it all
come the silikal is considered blush
pink cream a grey and luck I think and
they all have different rhythms like the
gray one is gorgeous it was between this
and the gray and the gray had a cream
ribbon so you must mix up a little bit
but I mean how beautiful is just a very
simple v-neck jumper but I've killed
enough to an unarmed gonna wear it so
much then back to calve lower lower end
high street I went to next and found two
pieces actually this one being this
gorgeous pair of Navy and blue jacket
trousers it's a skinny pair of trousers
really lovely texture to these it's
almost a bit of a ruffle very textured
feel and they just fit really nicely
nicely I kind of wish nails I bought
Thor because these are actually I'm
usually six and these are a fix that I
feel the cooking time it tie to the
peers around the legs but round the
waist after the cause a little bit more
cinched in for overall families is
really beautiful and with a pair of
pretty kind of nude or blush pink
stilettos you just look really
sophisticated and to go with those I
mean I know I like my shirts I've got a
lot shirt first picked up a really
classic simple neck shirt this is part
of their kind of signature cotton range
non-iron slim fit it's also extremely
long which I really quite liked about it
and so to really pop I'm gonna turn it
in a little bit more yes it is very
classic simple white shirt but the
quality is actually really really nice
it's very structured it feels like if
you're going to hold it home which is
good cause you can advance shirt to feel
structured and tailored and it
definitely does so that goes so nicely
with the trousers and the last clothing
piece to mention is this gorgeous vest
from rag-and-bone is that making your
eyes go for it maybe I'll just quickly
show it so you can see what I'm talking
about that's making my eyes feeling so
you can look at it on the monitor Susan
from Ragan bone it is a Navy very
elastane cotton it's very kind of
stretchy cotton material in a Navy with
these white it's like white cotton
pieces
threaded through almost like cooked out
details it's very intricate very pretty
and below that is also another piece of
fabric so again you're not going to be
showing your bra which are quite liked
about it so it's a fight one of tops to
throw on any day and just know you can
put the covered which is look so
flattering on the female figure I think
it kind of accentuates the neck with the
hind
and scoop down over your over your
collarbones and then kind of comes
around sides and you say it's very kind
of flattering for the form and it's not
too long so it's kind of skims the
midriff I wore a lot of this kind of
style top at last year and riddles of
them and I saw this and straightaway
even Alex is like yeah that's really
really nice so I treat myself to fish as
well and absolutely love it I think it's
a really great piece for next season
like with all these pieces I know like I
really thought about that before I
bought them I know I'm going to wear
them so so much I'm pretty sure you ever
see me in these a lot so once a lot of
them were a bit more expensive I almost
kind of wanted to readjust my wardrobe
put some pieces in there that I really
love wearing a bit more special for me
so why did and got to life pieces that I
did buying which their clothing but was
part of the whole yesterday dimension I
got myself a brand new Charlotte Tilbury
cheek to cheek
yeah cheek to cheek blush and in first
love which is mount suit favorite
because my wonderful boyfriend Alex
accidentally dropped mine the other day
and it smashed after that set so we
brought this if you watch my best after
a 16 you'll know this is my favorite
butcher of all time so any disc in a
blonde and your last thing that I also
got yesterday was a brand new iPhone 7 I
went away skiing with Carly Rowena
besties and Leon and they both have this
phone and I really learned just how
amazing the cameras in comparison to all
the others so I'm really I mean this is
my job if I do I use my phone every
single day I'm sent a minute so I wanted
to kind of update my phone and get the
latest camera and the latest cast
features so that's why I did I traded in
my old phone and ended up getting the
rose gold 7 plus and a little bit so far
I can yeah it can recommend it to a5
you're thinking of upgrading
yeah and also if you do go into a
climate like this but if you go into
Apple they do buy back to your old phone
so for example I had the 6s plus so you
have a successful off you'll be able to
get 295 for an apple and then put that
towards buying yani phone which brings
down the price we found quite
considerably so that was everything you
get from yesterday's hole I really
really hope
you enjoy this guy's let me know what
you thought about this kind of video I
know that a lot of you prefer lower end
high streets most people really prefer
this kind of clothing a lot of you also
really like luxury I'm going to do a bit
of everything for everyone Alice excuse
my kind of favorite style of clothing
right now I'm very kind of middle range
high street I think that the quality is
superb
I know it's a little bit more expensive
but they're pieces that are you can
invest in for a couple of seasons and
this remain really beautiful keep the
shape great fabrics great quartz to
something a little bit more unique thank
