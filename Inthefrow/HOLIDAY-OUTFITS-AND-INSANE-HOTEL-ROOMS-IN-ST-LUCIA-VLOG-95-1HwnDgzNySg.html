town on
we have my routines and we like to have
a carton of toast and coffees in the
moment and we're not going to get that
now
oh okay okay so beautiful
okay guys we just arrived at jade
mountain I have no words for this play I
don't even know what to show you first
let's just say there's no walls there
are no walls on this room I literally
thought we'd walked into the dining Gary
we got it the whole thing is completely
open plants like the bad is so there's a
bed there is the infinity pool there is
the view seating area Alex popping
champagne men up here
Oh jacuzzi tub oh my gosh double sinks
I'm literally speak and speechless to
another awesome week yes I like them
guys listen to that noise
the thing that's making that backseat
well the sauce it was an alarm or a baby
bird
so we found out it's actually teeny tiny
frogs and they described you big
constantly about an hour right what is
that noise I mean don't get us wrong go
totally light embracing the outdoor life
from the crickets to fine but it was
consistent for about five minutes
get us looks as well so I'm definitely
wearing earplugs and they do give you
eye masks actually I really want to wake
up when the Sun starts to come up anyway
we just gotta sell a little bit ready I
mean I'm very very minimal because I'm
not even that hungry it's a very odd
time right now in UK time it's probably
about water and me yeah a little bit
food maybe adjourned tonic and then back
here this is such a pretty dress I
really love this dress this is all Fame
oh and I'm sure it's all thanks to my
shirts as well and the quality like okay
I'm feeling silky smooth keeps me very
high I'm gonna be buying every single
one that all things
yeah really go down I was like breakfast
no lunch no dinner
and yeah all the birds just woke me up
and I looked over and saw this and
that's sunrise it's coming through town
last night
look how Dan Gaia and let the white
sheets don't have horrible orange stains
hello this might be my favorite time I
slept in it I slept in this hasn't
transferred at all the bed is completely
white white sheets right bad I don't
know what today we're gonna go shooting
lots of wildlife you're gonna go on a
big adventure man 30 min we've got in
the sand
but it attempts to become good at the
beach what am I going to the gym as well
I feel yeah he died so disgusting then
got even just not been on that flight to
ten hours I just really want to go
stretch yeah me too okay guys so after
yesterday's flight when I kick off today
by just quite a bit as a mask on my face
I brought these masks with me so I could
just kind of have like a purifying
detoxing mask session and I had read
mark a dozen times got to bring them
along with me and I brought my favorite
three so I could multi masks in fact I
think I've shown you guys these lore'l
masks before these ones cuz I love them
they literally like my favorite masks I
just find it they just really do what
they're meant to I mean also it's the
month of play form a month I've claimed
a oh there's Alex nicely with his top up
again when did I like to actually ever
have a top on its l'oréal's month of
clay May and again they just want to
kind of bring attention to the fact that
these are so good and it's all about
just looking after yourself having a
lovely pampering session for yourself so
I'm gonna multi masks because these my
favorites and I want some things for
each part of my face when I wasn't
playing you could see how dry
you must get a nose I cannot actually
wait to do this masking so I'm gonna go
for a little for blemish rescue across
here and here I'm going to go for detox
across my nose and I'm gonna go for
brightening right across here I think so
the blue one contains three different
clays and a marine algae extract it's
good for light spots and blemishes or
blemish prone skin just a kind of help
and clogging pores and clearing black
hairs and that sort of thing so this is
perfect for here in here and by the way
don't get on your eyes and lips but
everywhere else is all good
okay so the yellow on this has three
pure clothes and you see Lenin this is
for clarifying the skintone illuminating
just adding overall brightness I'm gonna
put this one across my she could just
warm up right now to that later on my
highlight will be puffing nice and
bright
this is probably my most used mask like
I just think it really really works
so obviously detox mask assist for
detoxifying the skin just so your skin
looks a lot more like clarified purified
fabulous so I'm gonna put that on my
nose
so the soldat boots so if any of you
guys do buy a couple and Meg and mega
mac and multi masks just make sure that
your hashtag clay awake then L'Oreal can
see you right it's gonna leave that cuz
he's find you on pin on a little while
I'm gonna leave another five minutes
probably and use won't cloth and then
take this off I'm very very left
it's got jealous and put on a detox mask
this C is insane today I'm just gonna go
and get a little bit of breakfast just
thrown on this jump six yeah when I put
much else on
