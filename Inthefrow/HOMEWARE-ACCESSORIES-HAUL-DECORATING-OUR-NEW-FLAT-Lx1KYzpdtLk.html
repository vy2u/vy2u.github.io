welcome if you're brand new here and
welcome back if you're already
subscribed if you're not already
subscribed then it would be amazing if
you just joined and subscribe down below
I leave a link some on the screen for
you you may think to have you back this
video I'm gonna carry on with a whole
like flat moving vlogs that I did and I
kind of promised a few like home wear
holes we're coming up and tours and and
all that kind of thing I know you guys
like to see where I'm working and what
I'm doing and where I stole my clothes
and everything else so I thought I'd
kick this off with a home wet accessory
told at some point I'm gonna go through
all the furniture that box it's a lot to
new finish yeah obviously I can't kind
of like hold up in front of you I want
to do that in a different video
alight is seriously playing with me
today it's testing me turning out the
clouds I'm gonna see if I can make this
work right okay so where do I even start
so what happened is we moved from one
place in London to another place in
London this place is quite a lot bigger
I would say it's to me it feels almost
twice as big it's the last place there's
a lot more room to put new furniture and
to put accessories and make it our own
and make it much more personal so before
I moved in I went on a bit of a binge
buying lots of different like prints and
vases and all that kind of thing just to
make it much more homely for us just
like a space that we felt really at home
and really safe and secure and
comfortable yeah I'm just gonna dive
right in and pick out some things that I
got okay first we want you to make the
place quite natural and feeling quite
health being clean so to do that we
thought we'd get lots of lovely plants
so first up this cute little piece from
H&amp;amp;M it's just a gold pot with a cactus
plant in the middle very sweet and small
you can kind of leave this in your
bathroom she wanted to I have it on my
office shell I mean you could place it
wherever you really like but I just
thought it was quite a cute little piece
and nice and easy from H&amp;amp;M the bulk of
our plants so it came from a website
called patch really cool website if you
live in London and perfect if not then
I'm really sorry this might not apply to
you guys but they're pretty much like a
plant
delivery service in London sort of
centralized London area it's not super
far out never really sweet little
website with all the outdoor and indoor
plants you can also buy plants for your
balcony if you have one and you can just
choose the ones you want you can choose
the parts and they literally will just
come and deliver them straight to your
door so it's super handy if you don't
wanna go to a gun
I don't know where to buy nice big
plants and things I would highly highly
recommend them like with using twice now
and they're really really good so we got
this we got a really big pot plan that
we have in the lounge which I love got a
lily that we have in the bedroom and we
also have a little baby fern that we
have in the bathroom don't know why it
is so dirty an excuse the fact that
these hydrangeas are completely dead and
I need to buy some new ones in fact what
I'm gonna do
that'll be some things that won't be in
this hole but I will have soon I found
somewhere that sells fake hydrangeas
just like literally looks just like
these for like 16 pound of stem and
they're from John Lewis I'm gonna buy
two of those to go in here all the time
so they will not die but this is a vase
I bought it's like a blush pink glass em
I don't if you can see the blush pink on
the camera but I love it and this is
what I wanted it for just this with some
cute little hydrangeas in it very
blogger life like you've both seen this
on several different bloggers but I just
love hydrangeas and the white petals so
that's why I wanted so much a really
beautiful face and these as well I
believe I got this from a company called
perch and Perot
and I actually have I think it's at 10%
off code or 15% off code yeah I think
I've got attempts at off code for perch
and Perot
if you've seen the rose gold mirror that
I'm gonna mention soon you seen that
rose gold mirror that's also from perch
and Parros so if you were interested
then that 10% off will kind of be super
useful so anyway yeah forgot this for us
and I bought a another of ours as well
this is also from perch in Peru just
really easy
sweet little gold very fast vase which
whether it's almost a little bit
textured on the gold I think it's the
metal yeah it's the metal it's not very
heavy that so I thought is it like so
it's a gold metal quite textured I feel
like the shape of it with these diagonal
shapes don't even know what you would
call that oh it's a hex I mean it's a
hexagon shape and then when these
diamonds sides just really sweet you
just put like one flower in this I just
have this on my coffee table which won't
be in this hole it will be in the
furniture hole nice have it on the
coffee table I really like it oh I'm
going to stick with pitch and power also
from perch and pear oh I got this
Lantern
yeah candle lantern that I have in front
of my fireplace in this you can put a
beautiful big white candle red candle
anything
you really like I didn't have one at the
time but I did have this super easy
little candle not not even sure where
this is from now just one of the candles
are collected over the years and I just
sort of leave that in there but I
thought it was really really sweet yeah
set v Nixa fire okay what else we have
two quite quirky pieces that we
absolutely love first one being this
candle holder which is a rocket it's a
gold metal rocket this is from diesel
living when we now excel it in Florence
we will literally like we need this in
our lives where you can put candle in it
if you want but we decide to leave it as
this little rocket and we have that on
our side place in the lounge yeah it's
very unique it's quite different but we
both just love astronomy and everything
to do night space and we have many a
discussion about space let's just say
that and I always wanted to be an
astronaut when else you get so I just
really loved it but to go with that
how's it buddy how's the body which I'm
sure you've probably seen by now
this is Astro we named him Astro this is
our astronaut and again we've got a
little area to put candala so you could
have them as like joint candle holders
side by side like we do we have them on
either end of our fireplace this guy it
feels like a porcelain kind material and
this is in a metal I'm a big fan of
these yes Lisa both from diesel living
might as well continue with the
fireplace our best friend Rebecca all
the way from Chicago ordered us some
cute letters from Oliver bonus so she
got B and a the the end egg which is
also kind of stands for the Victoria and
Albert Museum as you may know but also
sounds Victorian Alex so that was just
such a really sweet idea and it's
actually funny because I was looking at
these online and I was gonna get fr ow4
fro and have it somewhere in the room in
my office but so the fact that she was
sort of on the same wavelength but she
went for the cute personal option of VNA
thought it was super sweet
can I get inside the gift section now
also from Oliver bonus for a moving in
gift oh also no it's a birthday gift
it's birthday gift from my manager they
got me this really gorgeous it's like a
decanter and Oliver bonus so if we have
friends round we can make like cocktail
from this and we can make wine spritzers
and all that very cute kind of things
for dinner party it's not that we have a
dinner table i thing we don't have but
otherwise I like to just keep this out
it's like a phase about this much what I
use those but as beautiful and it's my
touring
pink glass and to go with that I also
have these tomb doors from Oliver bonus
this is green pink deeper green and
there's also an orange I think which
we've just been using just for different
little drink so we have the gorgeous
again they were from a manager so thank
you guys
continuing with tableware I thought I'd
show you my new play a little bit
obsessed of these I got the bowls I got
the big dinner plates and I also got
these smaller side plates as well but
it's got these from John Lewis I just as
soon saw them on the website and just
love the style I don't know what it was
I just meant about the clean white with
this cool like watercolor blue on it I
thought it was really beautiful yeah
it's always nice to have food that's
exciting to look at and sits on a pretty
plate forgot those yeah and the bowls
which are great for my cereal bowls did
you also have larger pasta bowls as well
but we already have some cool pasta
bowls we didn't need those so I just
kind of got the three sets overall and
I'm gonna continue with kitchen things
and show you my niece Mac so this is the
Smeg coffee maker in the blue which
matches our fridge it matches our
toaster and we also have the kettle and
we saw the coffee maker
we adore coffee Alex especially loves
his coffee and they finally sounds like
a little steamer on it he can make like
froth up coffee's gonna be like FRA too
hot chocolates if you want to and
obviously it's got like real coffee
three section where you put the coffee
ground coffee in there and you tap in
you almost can feel like you're at cafe
Nero with this bad boy now in our
kitchen I love it so much it's so cute
obviously I'm not holding the actual
thing here because it's heavy and it's
also in the kitchen but I thought I'd
show you the box the one thing you
haven't bought yet is cushions I'm not
bought enough cushions because I'm still
waiting on my sofa which you'll see in
the future hall when it arrives next
week but I have bought two cushions that
I can show you again these are from
perch and Parros so again you can use
that discount code if you'd like to by
the way and make no money on that
discount code whatsoever it's just a
discount code that they gave me to help
you guys out
yeah so this is the first question that
I got palm print really nice fabric on
the back it's just a full teal blue yes
look at this question cuz I thought it
would match with our teal sofa it's on
its way and so it's got a little bit of
teal in there beiges greens and then on
the back is a deep blue teal and it's
just
keep at it it's nothing worse than when
you get a cushion and it's like thin
with no padding like that's not a
cushion that's like a very thin pillow
so on is it nice and padded an if so
Labatt laughs and I have the other
cushion that is also in the range which
is in a rectangular shape in grades with
a bit of gold and whites and then just a
white beige on the back as well
yes it is kind of like scatter cushions
I'm gonna get lower different types of
cushion as I think for that room there's
still there's lots of pass in a lot / in
a lot of color yes I think it'd look
really nice but lighting I picked up
this lump from ICONic lights it's called
a steampunk lamp
it's got one that's really cool an
Edison bulb just a very cool bulb you'll
know what I mean when you say it it has
got a very retro vintage vibe to it and
it was really really affordable it's
like 30 pounds so love this it's great
this gives off a really nice warm light
as well to the living room so big fan
and my favorite favorite things actually
that got the new place is this throw but
this is also one of the most expensive
throws or things I've even got ever this
is a Missoni throw so it's a little more
expensive when you buy things on them
used to be aroma you can of gain points
but like a boot guard and I had enough
points that would buy this so I thought
I'm in love with this throw I'm just
gonna treat myself because I would have
had those points anyway so I did and
honestly I'm absolutely smitten with it
it's beautiful the material is
incredible the colors are stunning like
it runs through so many different colors
all the way up the throw I just
absolutely love it so much so I just
have it draped like no one really
touches is throw apart from me when I
found this chair I don't really touch it
because I was like it is almost like an
ornament piece to look at it's just
beautiful and now this one's back out
again I don't get me wrong I love this
song but I'm not used to film with
sunlight so it's just really irritating
see it's gone again it's gone again it's
here it's there it's gone I've one more
thing I can show you here because I've
got it here and the other two things I
cannot tell you about and then insert
some cutaways for you first thing
well artwork of pictures and prints and
things we really like to have a lot of
artwork and pictures up on the walls so
I found this website and I found this
print out
in love with this I love the color
combination soft teal greens in the
windows with this orange on this girl's
dress the bird in the window there was
something very Instagram about it is
something very kind of modern now we're
just kind of represents a lot of what we
do in this whole blogging industry and
the kind of pictures we try to create in
this sort of fantasy whimsical lifestyle
that in Instagram often portrays but it
also reminded me a little bit of an
Edward Hopper print which I really
really loved I love Edward Hopper so
yeah I bought this and I've also bought
a couple of other pieces from this exact
same place it was a really cool wave
print above his desk and we also have
two other prints in the bathroom that
the moon and the earth and they're from
this exact same website again so I'll
leave it that link down below I'm not
too sure what it is I'll have to find it
if I'll leave them all a link down below
but they do some really cool artwork on
there to live them pretty quickly and
there every print that you buy you can
have framed neither gold rose gold white
black a few of the colored frame so
that's pretty cool and don't know many
other websites that do that and make it
really really handy and the only other
things to mention I also can't bring in
here is first of all the rose gold
mirror which I've now seen every other
blogger house as well I think Susie from
hello October bought it first she saw it
first on perch in Peru she bought it
obviously I love Susie and I was
following her new home where Instagram
and saw it totally fill up with it I
bought it but I've seen quite a few
other bloggers get it so I think it's
that kind of InStyle mirror so but again
I've got that 10% off code down below if
you do like it too then feel free to use
that and then we also bought some
beautiful beautiful prints from another
website I think it's called junk unique
again I'll leave it linked down below
I saw his coat it is a print and
completely fell in love with it it's not
feeling when you see a piece of artwork
or a print and it's straight away it
means something to you and it kind of
gives you like an emotion straightaway
else I could love that a little bit I
love the color combinations I love the
whole setup and the 2d style of it so I
really really wanted that but I wanted
it in like a trio so we all sbatch pan
and we also bought New York as well so
it's kind of a little trio of prints and
I guess I'll leave that link down though
we can get those but I don't want to
bring those in right now cuz they're all
on the Warhol's but apart from furniture
I think that's kind of the bulk of the
home
that I have actually bought for the
place so far it's quite a lot so I hope
that wasn't too long but leave
everything linked down below for you so
you can just go find everything really
really easily I hope you enjoyed this
guy's and it maybe gave you a little bit
of home we're in spoke I know that a lot
of people are moving right now and
people are really into the whole home
we're moving tours and things like that
so I hope that this did not disappoint
