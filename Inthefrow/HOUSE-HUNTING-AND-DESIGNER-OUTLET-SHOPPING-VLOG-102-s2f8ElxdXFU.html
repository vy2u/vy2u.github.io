domestic goddess in their domestic sexy
goddess with no top on yes it's been
good day in fact I wanted to talk to you
guys finally I wanted to talk to you
because I didn't manage to do that
yesterday so after we got back from Miss
a village it's a bit of a rush because
our friends Natalie Miguel coming over
and we were just rushing around the
house getting all tidy and stuff for
them so I don't really get to chat about
everything amazing went all the way over
to Vista was because we have started
house-hunting I moved out of that my
home when I was 18 to go to uni and ever
since then pretty much every year since
so almost well 10 years worth I've moved
flats apart for me one or two flats are
stayed for 18 months why but anyway you
don't really talk about good 8 flats
anyway bit sick of it but sick of first
of all throwing away my money on someone
else's mortgage and I'm also sick of the
constant movement
we love where we are now so I'd happily
stay here for a lot longer so we're just
looking we're not wanting to move
imminently cuz we absolutely literally
love this flat location we love how her
like homely is where we're super happy
we're intrigued about the idea of maybe
owning our own home soon and I like the
idea of BIST ducks it's really beautiful
around there it's quite chilled it's got
the best of village if we do whatever
want to go shopping but mainly just
because it's a really nice chilled out
place so yes we went just having a
little look at some houses yeah
absolutely gorgeous I was a little clip
I film this clips my best mate but I
thought that you guys might
like it because I know how nosy I am
when it comes to looking around like
shale homes in other people's houses and
see what the interior is like and this
was a really going to show home you
might just like to have a little peek at
it just to see what it's like around for
lectures and master suite well this is a
king-sized bed so its massive it's like
a dressing area
huge door swing this is the second room
the main bedroom I think would have a
spare room it's got an ensuite with
shower sin that was a house that we went
a little look around absolute gorgeous
loved it loved it would feel the time a
little think about it because we know
it's the first place oh yeah so I'm your
office we're gonna go look at some old
house as well and you know mix it up a
little bit and we may not even go a bit
stir in the end so we're just you know
testing the waters something it's just
practice it's just good practice
practice practice it also feels very
grown-up
yes very grow up to stay with you
forever no no I just had a really really
good day and so it's good that you
enjoyed it yeah I've met loads loads of
people I met loads of these guys today
which is absolutely amazing I've been so
inspired by the clothes and the talent
and the creativity and just looking
through people's portfolios
it was nice as well it kind of felt a
bit emotional being back in that
University setting as well it can't just
reminded me if also when I worked with
all really old graduates no because we
graduated ages ago 7 years we graduated
12 years ago no no any old lying to
anybody
what can we watch watch some friends
shall we anyway so I will keep you what
day 2 at the house something something I
want to bring you guys along with
me and the rest of my life yeah I guess
I could pass this question to you guys
we want to find a house that is near we
off to London that I can get to London
within an hour on a train I also want to
be able to get to Heathrow within an
hour buy a car because we travel so much
we need to be able to get to the airport
and Heathrow is my favorite but then we
also don't want to be south because then
getting home to my parents it's gonna be
nightmare so we need to be north or at
least west of London so somewhere around
there so if you can find me somewhere
around there guys that you think would
be great for me and Alex somewhere
that's still kind of cool and got stuff
going on we want pubs and cafes that we
can walk to we want some countryside you
never know why you guys might mention
somewhere I haven't thought hey I want a
bad dreams 50,000 yes so if any of you
guys have any good recommendations
someone it's kind of cool stuff to do
going on but so like countrysides Ives
not to like really busy but has an
amazing connection and isn't
ridiculously nice because we want to get
like a gorgeous I families now home I'd
love to know your opinion CAF you guys
always have the best ideas
