on range my hair lilac
I'm so excited about this any of you
like oh gee in who watches and followers
from way back when we'll know that my
hair used to be sort of similar to this
like a purple violet tone all over and
yeah I loved it it was pretty cool back
then and you a lot of you guys may
follow me back late with all very bright
and vibrant and now employ a little bit
hot and boring and white but I mean I
absolutely love the white but I kind of
want to experiment a little bit
I'm just so maybe you will know I'm so
proud to be in L'Oreal Paris hair and
Buster which you need to get to play
around with all of the new products try
them out first and when I saw this range
is coming out is just like dream come
true seriously it's amazing this is a
brand new L'Oreal Paris color Easter
range this is like hair color like you
guys probably been imagining so long it
just allows you to play with color do it
your own way do it in your style and
just really be experimental which i
think is just amazing sort of super
exciting so I'll show you if you might
call it just in case so your
accomplishment types in the range you've
got these cans which is a 1-day colors
just kind of spray these into your hair
saving like festivals maybe going to a
party maybe going to the event if it's
something where try out for the day got
these so these come in a couple
different colors pink there is lavender
which is gorgeous
there is turquoise it's a gorgeous like
JD creamy color love that there is hot
pink there is mint pastel blue which is
stunning and a grey so it's kind of like
my hair but even more silvery excellent
office there like one day washout colors
super fun and then you've got the
washout one week or two weeks so so like
to cause quite often it's one week so
example P chair can put this in and
after 2 or 3 shampoos elastic for like a
week off service but look at that color
so this peach there's also dirty pink
that lasts a week as well you've got
pink gorgeous like baby pink shade
last week there's also a personal hair
which lasts about weekly to three
shampoos then you've got the kind of
more rich colors so stunning turquoise
again I mean look how amazing her hair
looks and also cool thing about leaves
that they're different influences on the
box and so you may recognize a few I
mean it's like there's Liza lash this is
brittany grayling and those different
blogs and instagramers and youtubers
when the boxes I think is awesome
so I'm also red hair so it takes about 7
to 15 shampoos to come out this one
there's also burgundy again some 215
shampoo that looks amazing
so there's also purple hair this is more
like 5 to 10 shampoos but that's kind of
like where I used to be there's indigo
it's stunning again faceted shampoos
well when there's also aqua which is two
weeks ten shampoos and also just to
mention as well they all have a
collusive fader shampoo so you can use
it and it helps to really help speed up
the feeding process so if you've used a
collie not as keen on going try
something else
you can use this and it kind of helps
fade out of your hair a little bit
quicker she's awesome and later on I
just want to mention knows where I'm
going to use my L'Oreal LV lo shampoo I
mention this before I'll leave it link
on the screen now a video I did where I
mentioned this literally listen all I
take on holidays with me and it's what
I've used when I want a really good
cleanse when I just had a brand-new
color because it's like a shampoo and
conditioner in one and it means that
you're only washing your hair like once
after abuse if you're not having to
shampoo rinse conditioned rinse like
deep conditioned rinse you know see
constantly washing more and more of your
color out so it's so good honestly I
adore this product so let us get into
the dyeing process and probably this
procrastinate and put this up but yeah
I'm kind of between these two at the
moment I'm thinking to learn do the ends
of my hair so I'm thinking maybe going
with delilah
trying out a while it's how it goes and
then in future money from the school was
more purple potentially again see how
that goes
yeah like Nigeria China lilac pink with
the white the moment arm right now look
really really cute so I'm going to give
this to go few things to mention make
sure that you do a patch test with any
of these colors 48 hours before I would
just say to take a bit product
on the back just behind your ear on the
top of your neck and just see what
happens so that if it's perfectly fine
then you should be all good to go but
obviously it'll all be inside the box
for safeties to tell you kind of what
you're doing it but if you see any
redness or makes an imitation then
attend to this might not be for you but
yes just make sure you check all the
safety instructions in the box anyway
with any color product before you try
them just be careful oh we just want a
thing while I have you I will be doing a
meet and greet with the whole chorus a
team on the 5th of March in Boots
Stratford Westfield so you can come
along there lots of like cloistered
goodies I can get pictures with you can
chat with you meet you guys
yes so please - come on I'll leave all
details down below as well and I'll be
kind of making sure I mention it even
there at the time so hopefully you guys
are freaking come on and say hey right
let's get into the coloring so I've
changed and put down a sheet this is
like an old top so yeah you can on top
an old towel fold everything if you
don't wanna ruin things so I'm going to
start off by the bike Center passing my
hair I think ok so I thinking to go
across here and do this in sections and
it's going to be easiest way for me so
after the whole point is dies but you
can do it at home like super easy so I
want to show you how easy it's going to
be a really Michele show you the best
way to do it so I'm going to start with
that do the end and then alright so well
I'm going to go with eyelet in the Box
you get your say constrictions
you get your guide and y'all get
something up okay change of plan I got
rid of the arm thing I'm just tied
around and I've cut myself up with my
nails Monroe first paralytics no that
hurts right it's going to click the
brush my hair so we're not working not
sure why just do this I just got a comb
but I thought that might help me a
little bit right let's just go I'm just
going to like count them out how far
down do I want this to go that is the
question I asked some short layers I
have some long layers I can I just want
it to be the tip so maybe I'll just sort
of go with like very tips of things
Oh
okay I'm just going for it and just
going for it
oh my gosh I'm so extrange being
personal against it's been like over
here now up and white and it's so fun
good way to be to uniform either I don't
want to be like you know I thought I
like take that make some bit it's more
purpley and done I'm kind of liking it
color looks really cute with my current
color love it :
okay so next layer
thinking actually now looks really
really cute when it's going I'm really
excited on this cuz I'll either it's
kind of working
I think if you also have thought around
you when you're doing this with helpful
largely it could just like point out
that use more so it throughout the whole
of the rest of my hair down after good
able to help me feel to see where the
ends are just glue in the feelings firms
it you can do the ends of them as like
little tips and make the circle clearly
to used but I think that's giving when
to product you can kind of have fun with
it in might add a bit more fun into hair
color again so when I was purple the
amount of comments I get off
girls and guys so then I experiment with
their hair and play around different
hair colors but they weren't short
they're schooled let them or if they
like the color long enough or if it's
ruin our hair etc so this is like such
the good thing those peaceful
speaking of thoughts play around the
color have it into a few days wash it
out if you need to cut some fun back
into doing your hair again which is
really nice be like we're almost done
guys so easy family techniques work
pretty well as well finding like strums
it with it more uniform like fits here
in a kind of powder on it okay I think
we are done here okay so leave in two
minutes 20 minutes for more bandits to
stop early but 20 minutes for the kind
of one it vibrant and then wearing
gloves rinse until water and clear
perfect so I might get this side more
minute but wash it break a stage with
the LV and then I'll dry my hair and
then I will come back to you with a
beautifully styled ombre look
Jenner okay this is what I'm working
with with it straight I'll be honest I
think I did a damn good job look at it
now she doesn't look hombre I'm gonna
Bob sat looking about color it really
gradients so well because I made it a
little bit more like on uniform I'm off
- oh that was do you see how we're using
a 12 to get that I mean obviously the
usual ombre would be a little bit
is it might come to light bit higher up
so you can do it highlight by the font
is more albeit tips like I said okay I'm
going to sell this and show you it kind
of finished dinner what do you think I
am obsessed with it honestly and we'll
say we're not being in modest I'm
actually really pleased with what a good
job I've done it works so well
I love these a little bit such as have
little clips of it on here and then it's
sort of like this body at the bottom
just have much more of a color yes what
do you think I was like so impressed
with the colors I mean I've had the gray
on before they really silvery gray color
had that before and really loved it and
I just wanted to go something bit more
playful and fun and also seeing else was
kind of like the roots up in the fro was
always purple to get it at about time I
went back to this and also look how
