follow me on my Instagram I was a little
bit if you want over there I'm I just
really enjoy and surrounded the content
I put on that I'm extremely fussy about
what I put my Instagram so I feel like
it's like the cream of my content so if
you don't already farm in our be awesome
to have you certainly
right here oh we finished a new show
last night manhunt Unabomber and Netflix
beryllium if I had stopped looked at out
a million that's okay but uh it's so
brilliant guys need to watch it yeah
it's better than mine hunter I think
yeah but I think that's cuz it's like a
proper true story that's a true story
man
but you're not just based on true story
this is based on a true story
oh yeah but it's so right to it though
like the people of Casper it lot light
on my sense yeah they do to be furthest
phenomena it's very very well me acting
isn't it incredible
yeah Paul Bettany is in it and the guy
who plays the the main guy inhabit our
he's really good
the Australian guys yeah it's really
good in there yes it's a really good
cast um we were just great to work
without end of it we're like let's watch
another one totally Griffin but then you
have that lonely feeling when you finish
the series yeah nothing to do so I said
to Ryan sent me to watch Sons of Anarchy
again which how much they're coming
around soon but the problem was like
I've been saying no for so long because
we've practically finished that you were
like like no so I've just finished the
office us oh yeah the big whole of me
now actually really want to restart it
again don't you dad exactly my point
I'm so sick of hearing that intro six
seasons worth of that young show isn't
right 25 episodes per season nine
seasons oh my god
so I thought I could maybe just quickly
show you how I like to edit my Instagram
pictures every different blogger or
Instagram that you speak to will have
different varying ways that they like to
do this
some people like to edit on the phone
quite often I do to be honest so I have
a few different ways I mean aren't you
gonna love that about to say this but I
think I do think one the best ways to do
it these days is Lightroom it took me a
while to get used to using it because I
love Photoshop from I'm a bit of a whiz
at Photoshop cuz I learnt nut back on a
younger say if you've done like a big
shoe and you've got 200 pictures
Lightroom some people would say capture
one as well as
for this but we pissah prefer lightroom
you can just get all your pictures out
one by one and you can just flick
through them you can color code them so
for example if you want to see out 200
pictures you want to choose that 20 can
go through I have to impress 7 which
stands for yellow and it'll put them
into a yellow code and then later on you
can express yellow and it brings up like
those 20 pictures that you filtered and
then you can start going through and
adding your filters and your presets and
all that I would highly recommend
shooting in RAW at all times you can
shoot in raw and JPEG it's say for
example if you know that you've got the
perfect lighting and you're not going to
do much editing afterwards and it's
really quick you turn around between him
to get a picture right onto your
Instagram then a boy shoot in JPEG but
otherwise shoot in raw and Lightroom
handles roaring which is super well and
again you can just go through and choose
which ones you like and which you don't
in RAW you can do a lot more to a
picture than you could ever do in JPEG
because it saves all of the settings
like your entire environment it's almost
saved in the file which is why the file
size I mean the file size of each of
these is about 40 Meg a JPEG is often
about 3 MEC so you can imagine how much
more data is in that picture especially
if you're shooting at night the wrong
picture you can really pull up the
shadows you can brighten it and you're
cooking that color back in you know you
can you can just do so much more to your
picture then you would ever be able to
do with a JPEG so again it took me a
while to be converted to this but
believe me is it will just change your
life to start shooting in RAW and then
using things like Lightroom to look at
your images so as a post I did yesterday
I'm going all I'm gonna do is just go to
my pics so these are all my pics here
I'm just gonna drag them in Lightroom
now what we took loads because we were
just trying to get the lighting right I
couldn't work out how I wanted to show
off the dress properly I'm a heel and I
saw these rocks this bitch is here to
check all I'm just gonna just for the
ease of it I'm just gonna import them so
right so it's gonna start important all
these pics into here all I'm gonna start
doing is when I find one that I really
like where the dress looks good whether
you can see the
oops where the Sun isn't too strong well
it's nice to feel I means everything
that you think about with this picture
I'm then gonna press and then you're
like I'm gonna press seven because
that's what I like
it sets the label to yellow I mean there
are a couple of others something like
six seven eight nine they're all
different color palettes I just like
seven it just makes it yellow so I'm
just gonna go through and it's super
quick and just click click click I can
tell straight away if I like these are
not you know it's a lot quicker than if
you're doing it from a folder back onto
the whole page up here yellow and here I
have my chosen how many is this 38
pictures so now I just need to go
through it again and I'll have to do is
on the ones that I don't like as much
press seven and it'll take it out of
this category then I can kind of like
file it down better so I think this is a
picture I like the most it's got a kind
of vibe I want to go for it's got the
dress it's got the boots it's got lovely
colors behind it so then all you do is
go into this develop tab top right up
here and it'll open up all of these
different things now it might look a
little bit daunting at first but
honestly this couldn't be easier it's
things like temperature the picture
exposure and again like I said if this
is if you've got a raw picture you can
play with all these amazingly well so
right let's let me if you're gonna show
you kind of vibe so what I do is put a
pick up the exposure a little bit pick
up the shadows a tad down the highlights
a little bit this is something that's
great to do lens correction section
twinning on what lens you've taken this
on just like like see what happens this
picture when I do this it's almost like
the lenses vignette it this section do
you see how much bright that goes like
to do that
things like detail you can sharp and a
stop make it a little more sharp this is
my favorite one this one here this
HSL color black and white and I like to
press it all and open up these and then
you can play around the hue of each
color style the saturation of each color
and also the luminance of each color
where I'm up to in terms of the sky and
manage to pull it back this is what it
was like before we overexposed it so
that just took a little bit of playing
around little brush tool here this is a
little brush it gives you a brush has
brushed over the sky and pull the
exposure down and pulled up the shadows
yeah pull down the highlights and it
meant that I could then start playing
around with so for example if I really
pull the exposure down it's now like
look this is what you can see this is
kind of what it's covering so I've
pulled out the shadow so you can
actually see what was going on in the
sky at this moment and yes it just takes
a little bit of playing around with
because I obviously don't want it to
look ridiculous so okay you can see this
was before and this is the after
like that's how much you can pull the
colors back I pulled the sky back
brightened everything up a bit elevate
the image a little bit but still the
same image just worked around the colors
and made everything a bit more a bit
prettier just put this onto my Instagram
hello so many different news comes the
bloggers will do different ways I mean
that is just one way if you want to edit
on your phone I'd probably recommend the
SCO Snapseed facetune Photoshop Express
yeah they're my favorites it's do
slightly different things and just play
around them so to be honest these days
Instagram app itself has some pretty
good filters so yeah I mean I love just
edited pictures I found it really
therapeutic like I find it almost like
meditation I can lecture so now I can I
can play around so quickly with
different apps so I really enjoy it so
hopefully that was quite helpful I don't
have fetch the talk you only think I
have far from what I kind of do but yeah
hopefully it was helpful guys let me
know I know that I didn't really go into
massive amounts of depth but I think
that if you want that there are so many
other people who can show you that
better online on
sort of type in like Lightroom Lightroom
tutorials and you know watch things like
that this is just how I do it anyway I
am now I'm gonna go pack my bag for the
Maldives because this is going to take
me a few hours and honestly so I need to
kind of get on get on with it tomorrow
will be amazing I'm so excited for this
trip with benefit it's for their huge
launch the dinners launch and it's
called hashtag out-of-this-world no idea
yet with a launching let's speculate
together I think it potentially might be
a highlighter with it being out of this
world but it's got to be something
massive because this is a massive
massive trip for about a hundred
different creators around the globe
everyone is going somewhere
it's huge and I'm so thrilled to be a
part of it I can't believe it
so really really excited about it
actually you'll see all of that in the
next vlog will be flying tomorrow
morning it's gonna be a full day job you
get in there it's gonna be a bit
horrific and then finally get them into
paradise hopefully the weather's good
you for listening guys and I'll see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
