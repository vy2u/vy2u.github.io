fashion video I am so enjoying putting
these fashion videos together for you
guys it's been kind of something I
really wanted to do for ages so I really
hope you enjoying them all so far
today's video is gonna be all about how
to inject a bit of color into your
wardrobe I know what it's like when you
get into that stage where you look like
and you love white and you don't know
where these kind of very monochrome very
flattering outfits but I'm here to tell
you that color can also be amazing super
flattering and just add a little bit
more personality into all of your
outfits I know especially like my mom
for example the amount of times I tell
her to go and buy something a bit more
bright and colorful because I know that
her style can take it I know that it
will just inject a bit more fun and a
bit more vibrancy into a collections but
sometimes you're shied away from it and
I know that a lot of people do that too
so just wanna go through a few styles
and a few items I have my wardrobe that
I think just add a little bit more color
and a bit more fun in there sorry I just
realized that wasn't wearing any jewelry
so the continuity is completely off now
because now wearing jewelry but anyway
let's carry on so first up let's just
start with jumpers because that's what
I'm wearing right now I have not taken
off this jumper since I got it I've worn
it so so much it's one of those very
easy styles just to throw on I just wear
it over bright you could wear it over t
if you wanted to but with leather
trousers with jeans it's just super easy
to wear you don't have to go for red you
could go for any kind of color but it's
a jumper to start very cozy item that I
feel can really handle a bit more color
if you want to wear it with your black
jeans or your black leather trousers or
your black faux leather trousers or even
a black skirt then fine but I think cuz
it red was black always look so classic
very vibrant and statement and this
one's really affordable one from next
also comes in lots of other colors but I
really really love this jumper so far
and it just again it just shows a bit
more personality and a bit more
excitement I do have quite a lot of
colorful jumpers but this is another one
that is a big favorite of mine the
j.crew jumper this is actually
inside-out but it's practically the same
jumper by the way that you see it but
this has these gorgeous pink tones lime
looks and also red going through here
it's just a lot of different color tones
a lot going on and again I've got so
much wear out of it but with any kind of
knitted style you can put it with
anything that you want black wide leg
trousers or skinny trousers literally
anything the color of the jumper again
anything black it's just gonna look
really fun again fibrin add more
personality so again this is just a fave
of mine
okay dresses now I know the little black
dress is the perfect thing to wear for
most occasions and don't get me wrong I
love a good black dress totally fine and
I think with that sort of thing you can
add colorful shoes are a colorful bag or
a colorful jacket absol evilest so don't
want to go too far into dresses because
i feel that being evening attire it's
not quite as relevant i feel black it's
absolutely fine with maybe a bit of
color here and there especially even on
your lips pink red lip totally fine but
if you did want to just go for something
a little out of your comfort zone but
not too scary something like a burgundy
dress I adore this one so much it's
absolutely stunning so much going on
with this lace as ruffles this tool this
pleating it's very very exciting as a
dress but the fact it's in this burgundy
deep wine shade just means that you're
not shying too far away from your usual
black flattering styles this will still
be super flattering it is in a deeper
shade very rich tone but again it's just
a little bit more coarse a bit more
exciting and you can still wear this
with black shoes and a black bag if
that's what you prefer but someone who
loves to wear black all the time it's
not so much of a scary option how about
a colorful shirt this is one that I
absolutely love wearing it's from Tommy
Hilfiger it's not too much going on it
has a pinstripes and it's in a very kind
of baby blue and creamy white shade it's
nothing too overly scary but again
because it's quite neutral it's not too
exciting with the pattern I love shade
it will go with everything else in your
wardrobe even blue jeans dark jeans
white jeans I think when it comes to
working your way into a more colorful
wardrobe it's about finding shades that
suit you that you still feel comfortable
in there aren't gonna be too garish or
maybe two statements you feel like
people staring at you you know it's just
about finding your comfort zone within
color but I think something like this
works really really well it's not too
statement it's not too over-the-top it's
a much brighter exciting style then say
a black tee or a black shirt or if you
want to be a little bit fancier maybe go
for something in a material that's a bit
more exciting and then this one is from
Paige this is a gorgeous silky rose pink
almost like a rose gold
shave but this style again would flatter
a lot of people this one's quite low-cut
but if you could find anything else
that's a bit more silky in a bit of a
lighter shade again it's not too vibrant
it's a bit more adult down golden shade
but it would go perfectly with black and
you could stylist it with a pair of
heels and take it into more of an
evening look before I get into full
accessories I just wanted to kind of
mention one thing that could easily make
a full black outfit look pretty awesome
and that's just a hat any kind of hat in
your style the kind of style that you
like even if it's just a brighter beanie
like a red beanie with a full back
outfit looks awesome but something like
this this is it's very like London
sixties style but somewhat quite easy to
way you had it in fill different shades
this one I'll leave this one link down
below where you can get it but I love
the golden threads and the very baby
pink of it if you like pop the collar
and your big black coat it looks so cute
and again to spit more color
I think hats are amazing before adding
personality to outfits I keep saying
that but that's what I feel it's about
when you put outfits together it's about
creating and showing off your
personality and I think hats are one the
best ways to do that anyway on the same
style as hats you can also do sunglasses
but a really really simple way if I'd
never have colognes your outfit it's
just with a bag the amount of bags on
the market these days from so many
different brands in so many unique
styles and it's all about color I find
at the moment like the likes of Gucci
Louboutin Dior Valentino those guys
especially are all about this vibrant
color and coming into the spring and
summer months you can add so much more
color in that way and it just looks
amazing for your outfit this is one from
Gucci or CMAs so many times as all these
things from this video you have seen a
lot but something like this if you want
to start experimenting with a bit of
color a very gorgeous bright bag like
this a very bright color but again it's
not neon it's not a lime green or a
lemon yellow neon or anything you know
it's still a very mature and sensible
shade but it serves a bit more color
limit my excitement or you could go for
pattern like this Gucci bag I don't wear
this is much less sure nap so it'll love
this bag I'll bring this back out for
spring but adding in the color and the
pattern again a that statement piece to
your outfit it's that talking point it's
the thing that people see when they look
at your whole outfit it doesn't take
away from what you're wearing
you can still wear your fluttering black
outfit or white outfit if you want to
but this will just add that extra pop of
something unique if you're sort that
likes your bigger bags something like
the Coach tote this is in red and I
think it's pretty much sold out every
right now but coach do a lot of very
vibrant right bag if you just go for one
color all over again it's not too scary
and I couldn't do this video without
showing my absolutely favorite pack of
the moment and the most colorful thing
that I probably own right now it's a
Valentino tow all of these colors are so
spring appropriate and there's so much
going on but again it just adds that
brightness and that excitement to any
outfit okay let's talk about coats and
jackets because that's the thing I've
been most excited about I think
personally if you want to feel like if
you look your absolute best that's why
people like to wear a lot of black
sometimes I know that I do if I am
having a day where I just want to feel
my very best look really flattering and
what I'm wearing I will go for black it
makes sense but I think that therefore
you can wear an outerwear piece on top
of your black tea and black jeans or
whatever I feel like if as long as your
undergarments and your t-shirt and your
jeans fit perfectly you can take and
much more bright exciting color in your
outerwear piece I mean personally that's
the way I think you can do it so for
example so like this might not be to
everyone's taste but if you put this
with a usual kind of outfit it can
really add something fun to it I never
thought I would buy a pink jacket either
but when I pair this with gray
especially the gray with this looks
really cool I've got black role necks
with this big black chunky roll neck
underneath this it's not only extremely
warm it's just a bit more exciting and
this is only Topshop and this is so
affordable for a thick jacket as well so
I wanted to mention that well something
in more of a classic shapes it's also
belted is this one from Ted Baker it's a
lot more fun in terms of color I
remember when I got this my mom said to
me she loved this jacket and she wanted
it herself but she was a bit scared it
was too much color I mean to me someone
that loves color this is just a bit of
raspberry it's just a bit of Navy you
know but someone that doesn't usually
like to wear a lot of color I understand
this could be quite a vibrant kind of
coat again with your black boots and
your black jeans under this in the black
bag it tones everything down completely
and then you've just got this gorgeous
statement jacket little
that talking piece but this just have a
very classic style to it you can belt it
you can pull it in
you can keep your figure hugging shape
but again it's a bit cooler now if you
want to go all out with something very
bright then something like this this is
from a Limburger and it's a gorgeous
nude pink overcoat
it's gorgeous with the drape over your
shoulders but also just to wear over any
out for any outfit or really in darker
shades works really really well with
this but the fact that you've got a full
length Coe I mean this is long full
length over your usual outfit you know
it will just brighten up everything so
it's almost covering you you know it
brightens up the whole lock entirely and
because it goes all the way down past
like the center of your cards it's
almost covering your entire outfit so
just brightens up and elevates the whole
thing okay I could not feature my
favorite thing in the world right now
but camel coats yes they're quite
neutral and some people belie enough
don't really colorful but it's very very
different to black at least you know
it's a color at least it's a color but
it's classic it's traditional
it's that gorgeous piece that most women
would love to have in their wardrobe is
that very classic tailored style I've
always loved camel coats I've just
bought this one this is my newest one
from Max Mara but these looks so cool
with anything black honestly they look
so there's something so expensive about
camel coat of like a black roll net
black jeans very fitted outfit black
boots and then this supercool girlboss
camel coat of the top you can tell I've
got a thing for this but yeah it's just
super easy to inject a little bit more
brightness a bit more cool into the
wardrobe without going too fast and then
I'll just pull out a couple more of my
jackets that we're a bit more colorful
but not too over-the-top something like
this in a if it's a faux suede I think
it's almost a plum burgundy with silver
hardware but just bright in the black
outfit quite nicely again it's kind of
like a camel beige style but shorter
more biker bit cooler if you're not
really one for the more classic camel
coat it's just another way to do it in a
more trendy cool way or you could go for
leather faux leather something super
bright very girly very feminine but it
doesn't take away too much from your you
too
account fit apartments adding that
statement right now to the very top of
it
awesome limit model down like this one
that I've got for March in a beautiful I
love this a beautiful cherry leather
very biker very cool not too much going
on just a touch of color to finish let's
just go through a few shoe options of
course now all I shoes I want to show
you actually read that they could be any
style of shoe but as want to talk
through a few kind of scenarios really
these are a pair I'm massively in love
with these repair from race I got and
they go with so many outfits especially
black the red shoes with black you
cannot go wrong and it just adds
something exciting T feet for that
outfit I'm the kind of person that would
then add a red back before well you
don't obviously have to do that you
could add a red scarf for example just
something to ties in the two colors
together or even a red lip these are
more of an orange sunset orange red shoe
nice and bright Sylla classic shape very
feminine and they're not too daring then
we've got something that is daring it's
Dolce Gabanna booth these would be actor
for takes I understand that but I just
want to kind of show you that things
like this very patterned so much going
on I mean he's a very kind of garish in
some ways and it's something a lot of
people shy away from but if you are
wearing it with black outfits all the
time your black outfit will be able to
handle this patterning and this
brightness and this extremeness because
it is just all black like don't be too
worried about pairing something more
exciting the chances are if you wore
something like this with your black
jeans black tea someone's gonna say
something and compliment you on your
shoes because that's what they're gonna
say that's gonna be the item that's
super cool on your outfit like grab
someone's attention they just so for now
and love these and now if you want to be
super brave and bold these bad boys I
love these so much now these are kind of
thing I would suggest wearing if you
were wearing say your black dress you're
wearing say a mini black dress or
something that just skims your knees
something like this you're still in your
flattering black dress you look amazing
but you're adding some color there bit
sexier I know but paired down with very
cotton black dress you know it's not
gonna look too over
to whom sexy it does absent color and a
bit fun like I said it could be any
color black goes with any single color
in the rainbow I think I wear pink shoes
BAE shoes nude blue aqua I'm literally
like envisaging my shoe wardrobe right
now pinks reds any call you name it will
go with your black outfit so don't be
afraid to just add that little pop of
color whether it's a bag whether it's a
hat or pair of shoes or if you want to
go for a little more color in a jacket
then great or if you're even brave and
when I add it into your full outfit in a
shirt or even a t-shirt or jumper then
awesome I also think that color could be
so flattering it's more exciting it'll
grab someone's eye and attention to you
and it'll just brighten and elevate your
whole look you'll finally pull your skin
looks brighter and your hair will look
brighter with something colorful on I
doesn't really like color guys okay
