to style video this time in Canada where
I'm wearing lots of different band
t-shirts the first outfit I'm styling
with this Metallica tea and I want to
wear these really ripped up messy
girlfriend jeans just for a little bit
more shape just hasn't been quite edgy
and this is like going on with students
I thought you're pretty cool and if
accessorize with some black accessories
is Chloe hood some bag some really
bright pom-pom sandals and then this
Western choker the second outfit this is
an easy lock just with some plain black
skinny jeans no rips just very high
waisted very flattering for figure you
could either tuck in the t-shirt you
could wear out wear a crop like I have
here we're just with some easy sandals a
little bag and the chambray shirt of the
top has lots of very easy wear of a lock
but any day still quite feminine
flattering just the shapes and the cute
little sandals make it a little less
grungy
the third look is standard of denim
skirt this one I found is super fun it's
just got this cute insignia all over it
which keeps the look much more kind of
youthful and a bit more playful as well
I found this with some Brown accessories
for have these brown suede boots from
Marsh with embellishment all of them
which kind of matches well with the
skirt and the brown leather backpack
just works again with the overall color
scheme the fourth look I'm selling a
pair of white skinny jeans and these
rips on the knees make them a little
less feminine a little less clean but
they also brighten up the overall gray
shape and deeper shades in the whole
look so the bounty the black bomber
black glasses are are quite deep tones
and these white jeans are sliding them
up and add a touch more color
and the final outfit I Styles will pet
black Evi Mon jean shorts in the highway
system you can tuck in the t-shirt from
our flattering figure with a longer
length Lee Schatz moves are not showing
off your ten little toes underneath it
just keeps the whole look quite
flattering it's still quite feminine I
thrown on this blue chambray shirt add a
little bit more color and also to pull
it in at the waist if I wanted to the
love a little converse adjust that
feminine cutesy edge and the brown
leather backpack again has a little bit
more color and for
which was your favorite outfit please do
let me know in the comments below and
also give me opinion on whether you
prefer this video with a voiceover or
without I'll see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
