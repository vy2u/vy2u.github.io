been so heavily requested I'm finally
putting it together for you guys he's
gonna be my tips and tricks of how I
would turn a daytime look into something
more evening appropriate so to keep this
off I wanted to kind of put myself in a
situation like a hypothetical situation
with what I do I work from home so I'm
not necessarily out and about in office
situations and that kind of thing so
this is a scenario I've been at work I
work in an office somewhere in London
and I need to go from day to night maybe
it's a date night name its drinks out
maybe it's enough to work do so these
gonna be my top tips of how I take a
daytime look to nighttime so to start
off with I think a lot of its
preparation and it's deciding what you
want to wear that will be appropriate
for both a daytime and nighttime lock
when I got to thinking about this I
thought a skirt and top especially would
it be perfect you can dress it down with
a pair of flat shoes you can throw a
coat over it to make it really warm and
cozy it's appropriate for work wear and
it's the kind of thing that will also
suit a pair of heels as well so that's
what I went for to start with I went
with a love of skirt this one's from
Jonathan's simce and over the top I've
just paired it with a bow man but it
could be any black roll that you have or
it could be any skirt that you have so
for example I also have this one which
is a Surrey skirt suede lovely color
nice deep color it's a fitted and
flattering shape and again it works well
with flats as well as heels in terms of
shoes flat shoes so I thought I'd show
you the kind of thing out wear a pair of
these some unlikely aqua sara christie's
still look stylish and fashionable but
they are really comfortable actually
and again worked really well with the
color from this outfit ok outfits sorted
now moving on to the hair so right in
the morning the first thing I would do
is curl my hair so I'm just literally
done it I put a little bit of heat
protectant into it and then I just use a
conical barrel to go all the way around
and make it quite Beach wavy that's what
I was going for more beach waves and
then big Hollywood glam curls so to get
that kind of look I literally just wrap
each piece of hair like a good inch of
hair wrap it around the back of the
barrel leave it for a few seconds and
then pull it out and leave it quite
loose it all depends how much your hair
hauls a curl
what I'd really recommend for a lot of
people is to really
heavy on the curls in the morning so
that by the time the evening comes
everything will drop down it look
amazing but I still want to help my hair
along a little bit so I'm gonna add some
product into it I'm gonna use the new
L'Oreal Paris dye lifter this is the
beach wave the beach wave mist and I
wanna do is add this into the hair to
kind of keep that grit and Beach wavy
vibe this will be like a salt spray yeah
add about a bit more body texture and
grit into the hair which is perfect for
the look I'm going for this is part of
the brand new range by the way with
L'Oreal Paris a new stylist arranged it
smells beautiful and then obviously I
just need to set it with a bit of
hairspray so I want to use the L'Oreal
Paris daily stir this is a big hairspray
and it also has vanilla extract which
sounds gorgeous so again it's gonna go
straight upwards into the hair hold onto
those curls the love the size this
bottle it's a really handy travel sized
hair done I am ready for the day now the
last little bit of preparation is
getting everything ready that you're
gonna use for your evening I would take
a slightly larger bag to work this is
one of my large bags this is in the
Mulberry Bayswater the newer version
this will fit quite a lot it if you've
got any kind of big bag or tote take
that the idea would be that if you're at
work and you're getting ready at work
you can just kind of keep a bag like
this under your desk I mean you may not
want to leave your mommy maggot work
completely up to you if you have a lock
or whatever but you can just kind of
store it in there out of the way with
everything inside it so you don't lose
anything but I don't want to go for an
absolutely massive bag that was just too
intrusive this is a kind of size that
will just about for everything that you
need this is my plan guys okay first of
all a pair of heels you could take any
kind of heels that you like I'm bringing
these long because I love these heeled
boots yeah it was quite a powerful
gorgeous heel and this is what I want to
wear with this outfit I switch up my
shoes and probably what I would do as
well is instead of wearing my coat I
would have sling it over my shoulders
instead some people don't like it some
people do but I just think it kind of
gives you a bit of a confidence you know
it makes you look quite powerful and
quite regal almost what I would wear is
a camel coat definitely cuz I just think
it's just such a gorgeous look so that's
why it's safe the outfit and the last
piece of the outfit is you
quite easily take with you a top in your
back
maybe like a camisole so that's what I
was thinking I would take a camisole now
I thought would I put it in my bag or
would I wear it so that's why I decided
so I decided to wear my cami underneath
my real neck that's better I changed my
camisole because I was just showing too
much of my beads and I'm just remember
to put some jewelry you could also just
have a necklace just hidden underneath
the roll neck as well so your entire
evening outfit has been hidden
underneath you daytime outfit all of the
day of course if you got to be had a bit
of a sweaty day and you're getting to it
from the office and you're gonna be like
sweating maybe don't do this but if
you're gonna have a bit more of a
relaxed day and it's just gonna keep you
a little bit warm and then why not plus
the fact that you have it on will keep
it far less creased than if you've got
it smushed in your back with your shoes
that was my thinking on it back into the
back again what I'm gonna do now is
change up my hair again say for example
if you're going out for work drinks
you've been with people from work all
day you probably do want to change up
your luck and make it a little bit
different so what I want to do is a cute
little updo with a very messy pony I've
literally got with me and invisi bubble
and okay how do I want to do this do I
want to just pull it back like this a
bit of a French oh I could just fully
pull this back without a parting brush
that parting back a little bit okay so
I've got my hair in my bubble and was
gonna take the top to section and it's
gonna pull that tighter on the top as
it'll this elevate the top of the
ponytail a little looks a bit like this
just to keep the whole look intact I am
gonna add some products so I'm gonna use
a stylist err this fleek serum it's got
to engine 30 degree heat protection as
well it's a salt product you can add in
before you blow-dry your hair for the
heat protection and it'll keep it a bit
more sleek but you can also add it to
dry hair to help with any frizz and also
to manage flyaways which is what I
really like these for a little bit onto
my fingertips and then use that to push
away any areas that are just mean like
sweeping down any flyaways
I get a lot cuz I have a lot of broken
hair especially around the edge of my
hair so I like using
things like please sleeping and serums
just to get that more like sleek flipped
back look especially a few guys and they
offer a really sleek tight ponytail he
can do that but I'm quite feeling this
sort of vibe so today and then I'm also
gonna try out the pixie cream wax as
well playful support and reshape a bull
hold I want to do with this is let you
take a little bit this would be quite
pliable and it will really help add some
grit and I want to add it into this top
please can you think I'm gonna add it
into the top section of this ponytail
and take the hair in between my fingers
and just really rough it up and give it
real texture in that section it's this
is it we're kind of getting a look I'm
going for much more textured sweet
little pony that's a sort of sitting on
the the very sort of top of my head
without being too high and then just to
finish everything off I'm gonna go back
to the big hairspray just to keep
everything in place I have a lot of
shorter sections that often fall down
especially underneath so I'm gonna add
some of this in there just to keep those
managed and maintained what I think
would be nice is to carry with you is
smaller back it's also you don't want to
take this out with you for your night
out or potentially not depends why you
go in what for me I would carry with me
a smaller bag this is a cute little
Coach bag in a purple shade it's a bit
more kind of fun colorful it's got that
metallic vibe it's more evening
appropriate it works quite well and
inside it I've tucked away lots of
little makeup products that all those
kind of take my look from date one of
the things I always carry with me is the
L'Oreal cushion the nude magique cushion
which you guys know I'm obsessed with
now the good thing about these is they
do come with a sponge which is super
handy for touch-ups but what I often do
is carry with me a tiny tiny little
Beauty blunder let's take a little bit
on my sponge and just go over any
sections that just need a good touch-up
the reason I recommend this one is
because it's wonderfully juhi and
brightening I also like to apply it
underneath my eyes so it's quite well as
a concealer you know I see you could
just have a concealer with you and it
could work the same but I like that
adding that junus back into my skin
end of the day the next thing I'd highly
recommend buying if you don't already
have one is a palette that does a few
things in one so handy so for example I
pulled out this one this is a
bareMinerals one that half in here
you've got a very light powder a pink
blush and also a bronzer but just for
the sake of research I've pulled out a
few in my collection Charlotte Tilbury
bronzer and highlighter Urban Decay
Naked skin that literally has everything
in it from bronzers to highlights to
powders and over the side colors that
could be used more as blush as well the
it cosmetics palette with a bronzer
highlight and a blush in there got the
Tom Ford palette doesn't have a bronzer
but it does have a little bit you can
top up your eyes with as well as a
 and also a highlight Tom's
forward palette with bronzer blusher and
highlight beautiful so for this I just
carry on for brushes blusher brush
highlight brush which you don't
necessarily need you could use your
fingers and eye shadow brush and also a
bronzer brush so I was brought along my
little Tom Ford one nice and easy and
also height more hygienic in me back so
on this occasion I'm gonna use Tom Ford
all I'm gonna do is first of all going
with my kabuki a little bit of bronzer
and just warm those cheeks back up after
a day then a little bit of blush and
then into the highlighter then what I
also do is take an eyeshadow brush and
I'll dip into well first of all I dip
into the highlight and just apply that
into my inner corner this is quite a
golden toned highlight actually pretty
just off the brush and then and we just
go into my bronzer I love nothing more
than a bronzed I look that matches the
actual bronzer on your face I think it
looks really pretty and I'd let you just
take it through the crease pretty much
just to warm up the eyes add definition
to the eye socket like that
so you freezy now the other thing I
would do if you can fit it in your bag
also I love this the RMS Luminizer and
this just takes any look to something a
little bit more glowy so with this all I
would do is use
a little bit of the pot and again go
over the tops of the cheekbones just add
even more like glowy illumination I'd
add it over my eyelid
under the eyebrows pretty much
everywhere I put this a little bit it's
so nice
second to last product warning you so is
for a lip all I'm gonna go for is a red
lip liner this one is my favorite so
much cherry lip liner don't even need a
lipstick with this which is all you need
it's so creamy it goes on so easily and
it does look so pigmented and it's just
a liner tiny mini mascara it's gonna add
this to my lower lashes and just an
extra coat the top lashes as well so
that's like a super easy nighttime look
done and the very last thing just
because I love to feel like like I smell
amazing a tiny little bottle of perfume
I mean anything that you like this is
just a lil Dior one but a little bit of
fur whew it just makes you feel so much
sexier pretty so I've got my outfit done
I've got my makeup a lovely red vampy
lip if you don't want to go for a red
lip I know that red is a more obvious
choice for evening if you do want a vamp
it up a little bit but I mean I would
just say take a line in with you if you
want to go for nude lips with a pink lip
just have a matching liner it's really
gonna enhance the overall size and shape
of the style of the lip I'm gonna pack
up my little nighttime bag maybe with a
few little essentials for the evening
anything that I can afford to leave at
work and that is the whole look taking a
day look making it more evening
appropriate making me feel more
confident there's really enhancing the
way you look for the evening time
dependent on what you doing and I know
it's easy and I know it's simple but
that's the way it should be it all comes
down to the preparation the organization
of all your little bits that you've got
and then just leaving them somewhere
overnight hopefully if you can't leave
them somewhere then you've still got
this bag you can put your flats in here
you can put your top your roll net top
in here and you can still take out this
one if you wanted so completely up to
you everything that I've used for this
all the products all the pallets all the
hair products
I'll leave listed down below as well as
obviously everything that I'm wearing I
really hope this was helpful guys if you
