kind of setting and a video I've been
meaning to film for so long and we
wanted to bring you guys into the
kitchen to film something a bit more fun
cookery bakery related and I thought
this is a perfect opportunity so record
league have asked me to create the
perfect dinner party and if you know me
well and you've read my blog for a while
you'll know that record leg of the brand
I've worked with for quite a few years
now so this sounds like a really cool
thing to do and it was easy for me just
to invite some friends around create the
perfect dinner party setting and it's
something I like to do anyway so in this
video I'm going to be showing you a few
lovely drinks that we can have for all
of the guests when that alcoholic and
non-alcoholic I'm going to be going
through some of my favorite kind of
desserts one healthy option and one not
so healthy option and also a few
different kind of main meal options so
let's just get right into it
okay so first we're gonna start with
drinks now I was saying about record leg
so they have just brought out their
brand new cocktails these are so perfect
for barbecues and summer parties because
they're in the can so it just makes it
really really easy but I also wants to
use them in kind of a bit of a punch
kind of way just so that everyone I have
to have them out the cans if they don't
want to they can have them out of a
carafe I think for this particular kind
of punch that on a Cray I'm going to go
with a strawberry lime side a cocktail
so this is a Swedish punch flavor but
they also have the passionfruit gimlet
flavor which is kind of passion fruit
gin and a hint of lime and we also have
the wild berry bramble which is blended
with rum and dark berries so that all
super yummy flavors okay so I'm gonna
take my craft and a couple of the cans
by the way these are completely brand
new and they're the only cider cocktail
on the market so they're pretty unique
so three cans inside the carafe I'm
going to put in some like strawberries
some limes just kind of enhance the
flavors and just make it a bit more fun
when people want to drink it take some
strawberries just into kind of nice
bite-sized pieces
keep those strawberries straight into
our
I'm gonna go in with some raspberries
I'm gonna give them a quick grits
straight into a carafe and then some
lime just sort of segment not into
little chunks really and I'm gonna also
do a little bit lemon I think the colors
will be really pretty little bit of
lemon as well how pretty are those
colors luckily I have one of these
little Sarah things let's do that Allen
and there we go just a little kind of
punch pins kind of thing but with a
Swedish punch from record likes that
looks delicious and look how pretty it
looks then for the nogg aholic in the
group I'll be honest I think all my
friends do you drink alcohol and they're
going to absolutely love this it's gonna
taste amazing anyone that doesn't want
to drink that though I'm gonna create
something a little bit more
non-alcoholic but also really delicious
that's the mason jars and I've got some
barking elderflower press I know a lot
of people usually like this it's gonna
be super simple how adorable are these
by the way and I'm gonna kind of do a
bit of a similar process just gonna add
Oh blimey shoes okay it's gonna cut this
up into little chunks there's a few
little bits of line into that it's
really nice for the color as well but I
mean I just I don't know if it's just me
but I just love lime and everything it
just makes everything taste super
delicious a few chunks of lemon delish
and then just a few bits of minutes a
few lovely pieces into here
none of this dog that doesn't look
pretty and for slightly for color I'm
gonna go with some blueberries into each
and then a straw to finish and they look
super cute my favourite bit biddeford so
this is gonna be a recipe I've literally
made this so many times since I was
younger it came from a recipe book that
I had when I must have been about eight
and it's just a dark chocolate fudge
recipe for anyone that doesn't really
like unhealthy food this is pretty
unhealthy I don't usually eat much this
way we do kind of stay around the more
healthier options but we feel like it's
a nice little gonna party these are
little cute finger foods to eat little
piece of fudge so I'm gonna go with it
sod it for today so
dark chocolate you're gonna need about
400 grams just break it up into your
plan also I'm sorry if I'm being super
speedy with this but the point is to
kind of show everything that I'm doing
rather than like a full tutorial of how
to create all the different recipes but
if you kind of like the setting let me
know down below in the comments and give
it a like and all that I can try and do
some more cuz like in the kitchen in the
flow in the kitchen with you football
field but cabarets mix it all up just
gonna need a launcher ground can of
condensed milk you should just come
straight like this next up some unsalted
butter and words new 50 grams and that
is literally it how easy is that
straight onto the hub you seem to heat
this gently don't want to be boiling it
but just until everything is really
combined this is all combining nicely
now I'm just making sure it's not
burning and last thing is just 1/2 a
teaspoon of vanilla and I just really
like this Neilson Massey vanilla extract
okay so that is all perfectly beaten in
and I'm just gonna put it into nice big
dish just want to make sure that you
just quickly grease the dish before the
food goes in there always like to use a
bit of the butter packet and a bit of
the butter and just grease it that way
straight into the dish it is literally
as simple as that
but it tastes so delicious I cannot even
tell you are around and depending on how
you like your foot you can either make
this super smooth on the top or you can
make it quite textured if you like if
one should look quite cool and quirky
and more kind of like completely up to
that will do for me and that just go
straight into the fridge for a couple of
hours now be perfect and the second
option which is much more healthy
revolves around this gorgeous little
watermelon this is just for anyone who
doesn't really want the fudge but just
want something a bit sweeter at the end
so I'm just gonna cut it again down the
middle and then just in lines across
just into nice segments
and there we go I just feel little
extras we've got a few little nibbles
got some kale chips got some breadsticks
and pie it wouldn't be the same without
some peanuts if this is a really British
thing let me know down below in the
comments I'm sure that everyone else
really likes peanuts right nibbles
moving into me meals I have the idea of
doing some pizzas but we couldn't find
any dough but I remembered a while back
like a couple years ago I made pizzas
with puff pastry and it's actually
really really delicious and it's a super
easy to make
so I thought I'd show you this this is
literally how are you for the first good
old tomato puree so you want to leave
like an inch or so around the edge and
when it's cooking that's it's gonna
connect and bubble up and go really
puffy and really crispy this is really
good as well if you have kids super easy
to make some more on there yum yum yum
yum yum
spring Sakura Garneau oregano a little
bit of salt a little bit of pepper on
that base okay so this pizza I think is
going to be rocket pie not and yeah so
mozzarella first of all if you've got
grated mozzarella even better I'm just
gonna get in there get some little
chunks scatter this everywhere okay I'm
gonna go in with the pesto got a lovely
fresh pesto here I just want to kind of
like throw dollops of this on here
a little bit off Cheerilee on here let's
not go to creepy people also some basil
leaves just take some pine nuts these
like my favorite thing in the world it's
got just us everywhere cuz they're
delicious
that's literally it I'm gonna pop this
in the oven on like 180 degrees for
maybe about 15-20 minutes until you
pretty much see it rising and just keep
an eye on it like any pizza and very end
once they come to some rocket we just
don't really put this in the oven RL so
that's got a bit burnt so that's the
first one done I'm going to create a
second pizza and pretty much when
everyone's here throw them in the oven
get them ready so with this one we're
talking spinach olives and tomatoes it's
gonna chop these in half lots of
tomatoes okay and then we're also going
to take some silly lush tomatoes and
some black olives throw them right on
there the last thing is some spinach and
there we are two different pizzas both
not overly unhealthy I mean I'll see you
can kind of cut down the cheese if you
want to look delish okay guys so we've
done the nibbles
we've got the pizzas sauteed up a drink
and we got the foot and the watermelon
ready so pretty much the food is okay at
four so doesn't get decorating the whole
place with a dinner pie
keep it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
