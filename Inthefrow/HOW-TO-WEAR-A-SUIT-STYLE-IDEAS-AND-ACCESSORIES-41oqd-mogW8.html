video is gonna be all about suits a lot
of you guys have asked me to talk about
my suit collection how I like to style
suits how to feel more confident ways to
wear them what to wear them with and
this year for me is all about the suit
I'll be honest I've always loved
tailoring I've always loved to feel
quite confident powerful in my wear and
I get that feeling whenever I wear a
different type of suit so I started to
collect a few different variations in my
wardrobe over the years so I thought I'd
finally put this video together for you
guys so let's have take this back to the
bare bones of what exactly is a suit
so a suit is made of two piece of
clothing often either a jacket and
trousers or jacket a skirt two pieces of
glowy things that are cut from the same
piece of material same fabric so they
match and you can wear them together as
a pair I must be honest so there's a few
things in here that I want to show you
that I don't think necessarily fall into
that category and I honestly don't think
that you necessarily have to wear the
same material together to get a full
suit feel although a proper suit is made
with the same fabric but I think you can
kind of get a very cool formal tailored
look even if you don't have the same
matching pieces but I'll go into more
detail with that a little bit later I'm
gonna give this off with the first suit
just this one here this is Anna Prince
of Wales check it's one of the newest
suits into my wardrobe my collection I
was part of the Prince of Wales check
for quite a while it became really
popular last season and I really wasn't
kind of feeling it until I saw this one
and it was because of this sort of
injection of red that is what really
pulled me into loving this
just that little injection of color made
it a little bit more fun and also more
edgy added a more modern twist it is
otherwise quite traditional patterning
plus it's also very modern with this
cool red stripe down each side the
Blazer which also transitions into the
trousers which have a duo stripe on them
as well as the same register I've been
going through the check the reason I
really like this as well it's because
the Blazer is actually a little bit more
oversized again creating more of an
androgynous more masculine vibe to this
which I really do love wearing something
a bit more androgynous sometimes because
I feel that with a pair of heels you can
really give that very cool confidence
yes I really like that juxtaposition of
styles so I'm big big fan of this of
course I will leave links down below to
everything I show you here plus some
duplicates if I can find some in the
market for you now for a suit like that
I love to wear it with roll necks
especially so this is the kind of thing
that I've worn with it before if you can
see it's quite sheer here go through
with a very gorgeous patterning I would
then wear a lacy bra or a bra like I'm
wearing camera my Christian Dior bandeau
bra here and I love to wear that
underneath back so you see a little bit
of bra strap a little bit of detail from
the bra just poking through you get that
very slick vibe from it but a little bit
more for their eyes to feast on with
this patterning going through however if
you don't really want to match the
patterning of the top with the pattern
of the suit something super easy just
like a Kashmir hour wall or even a
cotton roll neck or a bodysuit something
quite smooth and slick and you can tuck
it in especially if you were in a
bodysuit it'll be very pulled in and
very flattering and then if you wear the
more oversized blazer over the top you
know it kind of mix up the two styles I
really really light up yeah so just a
half a roll neck black top in your
wardrobe as I said like a super staple
piece I think for me I would definitely
wear this to the office I would wear
this to meetings I would even go as far
as wearing this even to date night if I
had some gorgeous little shoes that in a
cute bag to make it a little bit more
glam and glitzy in terms accessories
with that I would pursue go with a red
shoe red to match it with the red in the
suit it was kind of a bit for no brainer
for me I like to match my accessories to
something in my outfit so something like
these were gorgeous the very pointed toe
I find works well with Blazers a more
masculine styles because it just adds
that feminine touch so you make
something masculine with the more
feminine pretty quite sexy powerful
woman style how many other adjectives do
I want in there I don't think you can go
wrong with a pair of Converse
all my trainers and I think that with a
lot of these suits you could just pair
them with a pair of white converse
something kind of low and cool or pair
white like adidas trainers and it'll
just add a very different style to this
a lot of girls pull this look off really
really well I know a lot of bloggers do
but for example this with the white
converse would look super cool very
dressed down chic very stylish
okay suit number two it's more of a
curveball it's that very bright bold
exciting statement suit not everyone
would like a red suit but I loved it I
loved it I felt so powerful when I wore
this I felt really gorgeous and
confident it's the kind of suit that I
would wear to more formal events I say
so whether that's a special dinner
special drinks with clients or you know
something where you need to impress you
need to look your most powerful but also
sure you've got a little bit of
personality you like to rock a suit but
you also like a bit of color that's the
kind of vibe to go forward that I think
now that was actually as well really
affordable if it's still on sale and
still in stock can link if not I'll try
and find some alternatives but this suit
overall was about 90 pounds for the set
absolutely amazing I mean there's a
multitude of things you could wear with
this you could just go for broke
underneath it or you could go for a roll
neck like I said before the black would
work very very easily with this however
I wore it with a cami
I think cami is like the perfect
clothing accessory to wear with Blazers
especially this one is very silky it
feels quite pretty and feminine it's got
that very slinky pretty touch to it in
this fabric and a little bit extra color
as well I loved blue and red together I
think it's a very pretty color combo you
go for a white can't even you can go for
black like I said we're just adding a
little bit of skin it does look really
gorgeous under a blazer I don't think
you can go wrong with a pair of nude
heels with any kind of suit in any color
nude goes with everything
almond toe works absolutely fine if
you're more comfortable in that I
personally really like pointy toes but I
don't think you can go wrong I think
nude pair of heels are an absolute
staple now I see it's a little different
and that it's sleeveless and this blazer
it's quite long length as well but it is
a matching set it's cut from the same
cloth to get this matching set and these
are both from pink oh well I love it for
the fact that it is sleeveless it's very
different everything else 1/2 in my
wardrobe and for me for this I would
keep your arms completely bare I would
go with a camisole I'd go with a
sleeveless bodysuit underneath in either
a white or a black you didn't go for
color if you want to you can go for
anything you like but I would definitely
keep my arms completely free of any
clothing say if you wanted to wear like
a long-sleeve top for example I would go
for sleeveless and it adds that more
femininity
to see you kind of slender arms coming
out as a blazer as well this isn't a
full black so you could go with any
color top for this something like this I
love to wear it with completely
sleeveless inserts a little bit of color
with detailing around the neck the
ruffle of this breaks up the very
monochrome straight sleek look of a suit
so that worked really well and again
it's just nice to have a bit of color
involved as well in fact there's a top
coming out very similar to this from me
a.m. and it's amazing and will look
amazing with that suit and I know a lot
of you guys aren't really into heels
like I am so something like the Sophia
Webster butterfly shoes would be
something that I would wear with this
something flat but also it in a color
that kind of matches with it the fact
that the Blazer is completely black
means that you can kind of go all out
with a bit pattern on the shoes if you
want to so the butterflies aren't too
much
having that gold thread running through
it but there's something quite elegant
about these shoes still have got a
gorgeous style to them they're not too
dressed down so I think it still works
at the same time the a flap and I'm also
admit these are one of the comfiest
pairs of flat shoes I own I don't own
many because I find it they're just
really but my ankles these are great if
you are thinking investing okay next on
the list is a white suit now this is
what I have from Rhys the fact that it
helps new lapels on this and it's got
this very smooth and slinky look to it
again I think adds more femininity into
this blazer and it's very long lengths
it's got almost an overcoat blaze of
style to it which again I really like it
looks gorgeous just hung over the
shoulders so you again you don't have to
necessarily wear this with the white
trousers you could wear this with so
many other things even just over jeans
it's like an overcoat blazer would look
super pretty
it's nice okay the mirror and I just
love it why have I not worn this more at
the same time there's something very
formal very elegant and very
sophisticated about this whole place of
style this is just from really often how
things like this and quite often
I'm sure than bringing out another one
for spring as well but with that I wore
this this is I think this is Kashmir
it's kind of like a wool blend neutral
move roll neck it worked quite well I
just tucked it into the trousers to pull
it all together and keep that very
flattering shape to the body the roll
neck help to elongate the net a very
smooth cut of the Blazer it does looked
really pretty I really liked it
again this is just another idea of what
you could wear underneath your Blazers
as well but I thought it worked quite
well for that one now as I saying
earlier as I don't believe necessarily
that you always have to have a matching
pair in fact right now I'm wearing it
Bala man blazer pair of mean em trousers
they don't match they're not come as a
set but I love the way that they look
together and paired together this is a
very structured blazer very formal a
very elegant style to it the trousers
have a mousesports looks feel to them
they have stripes down both sides it's
quite kind of reflective white you know
it kind of mixes up the two styles but
I'm really really like that and
underneath I've got in my Christian Dior
bra under this which is one way I really
like to wear it but again just a
camisole or even a roll neck works
really well so you don't necessarily
always have to wear matching blazer and
trousers I don't think so whatsoever I
often wear this bomb on blazer with
leather trousers jeans and skirts you
can just mix up the way like which is
why I bought this recently as a ski guys
I've seen quite often now the Stella
McCartney pink blazer I did look for the
matching trousers but they didn't have
them I don't know if it's ever come with
matching trousers but again I just love
wearing Blazers on their own I want to
pull this out for you guys who do like
the idea of a suit haven't invested yet
but just want to try out style for
yourself I would maybe go for a blazer
first and foremost rather than jumping
straight into a full two-piece suit
go for blaze I try out see how you feel
wearing it with your favorite jeans or
your favorite leather trousers with a
white tee with a roll net you know mix
up with your usual style threw it on you
might find that you absolutely love it
like I said white t-shirts work so well
under any blaze that I could have worn
listen to hear any of these Blazers I
could have worn this white tee with or
something a bit different
a lovely round net jumper again works
really well it's not too baggy no
Versailles so it feels quite fitted and
quite smooth this one house is lovely
embellishment at the top but with the
firework patterns going off this is Ted
Baker the fabric of this is quite smooth
and wool like again quite a
sophisticated style of fabric but tucked
in to trousers then with a blazer over
the top this really nice way to wear it
again lose an absolute favorite for me
to wear with suits the structure of
these quite often can work really well
with structure of the suits and again
it's quite a powerful looking key
so it works really well okay so this
suit is probably one of my absolute
favorites it's a full matching suit from
heavy studio the heavy suit it's cut
from the exactly the same fabric and
cloth and it has this transition of this
red color going through into the
trousers
so the trousers have a full stripe down
each side and this has a piping around
the edges they very much complement each
other and I love the red with the blue I
think it's super pretty but this is just
very fitted some of these suits a little
bit more oversized some of them at
longer length some sleeveless this is
very much that fitted suit I have worn
this before with this bra just
underneath it with it buttoned up I feel
so confident in that log out so it a
little bit overall but I've also won
this with a white t-shirt like this very
easy just tucked into the trousers to
pull everything together and again I
roll neck could work just as well but
this is one of my absolute favorites I
love the fact that it comes with a
little pocket square in the pocket it's
super cute and in fact I might buy some
more little pocket squares to put in
there and it's also got a really amazing
smoking suit vibe to the cut and the
style which is why I really like it say
if I'm taking my suit from day to night
maybe I've worn it in the office and I'm
going out something like these like
silver aquas or heels you won't
necessarily see this tying around your
leg because of this trousers but you
will see this silvery sparkly toe which
I think this makes it a little bit more
fun and like I said bit mob let's see so
those are all the suits in my wardrobe
that my absolute favorite right now I've
kind of wanted to give you an idea a few
different styles some in color some in
patterns some in you know different
styles to mix it up a little bit and
hopefully give you a bit of inspiration
