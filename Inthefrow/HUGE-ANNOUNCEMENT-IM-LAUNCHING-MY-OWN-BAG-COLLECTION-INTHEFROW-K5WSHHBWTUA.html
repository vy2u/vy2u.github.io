exciting video I've ever ever filmed for
this channel I don't even know where to
start I've been teasing on social media
and also in a vlog recently that
something big was coming and this is the
announcement video for that project as
you may be able to guess I am so excited
to announce that I have worked on a
collaboration collection with strawberry
I have my own in the fro strawberry line
of accessories from bags to card holders
to pouches in two colorways in a variety
of sizes just literally actually a dream
come true for me you can see them all
around me and behind me there are bags
there are pouches there are card holders
all with my branding on them always the
most beautiful silver hardware they are
so me I just had the most fun working
with strawberry on this project and
coming up with my own collection with
strawberry this is a bit of a back story
as you guys may know I have been the
biggest supporter a strawberry for the
past like 5 years 5 years ago in
Manchester I went along to a blog event
and it was a big room and a lots
different brands and the idea was to go
around and chat with people and network
and meet new brands and strawberry was
there and you were very kind of brand
new brand at that point they were still
growing based up in Scotland and I
immediately fell in love with their bags
the style the fabrics the quality of
them I was totally blown away and since
then I kept my eye on them see what they
were doing and we started to work
together and we kept in contact and
chatted more and for the past 5 years
I have worn so many strawberry bags I'm
the biggest advocate for strawberry and
I know so many of you guys as well have
heard of strawberry through me you've
bought bags from strawberry through me
and it makes me so so happy and recently
obviously seeing Megan mahakal wearing
Strasberg is she was also wearing this
bag behind me in the green color
recently in Edinburgh absolutely amazing
the princess loves your bags then you
are doing something right
okay the future princess the stress
became to me what feels like such a long
time ago now it was over a year ago to
chat about the idea of creating a
collaboration room
and I literally can't tell you how
excited I was
I was absolutely over the moon the
chance to be able to create my own line
and my own curation of accessories was
just insane and just a complete dream
come true so we've been working on it
ever since it's been a long time in the
making
the thing with Strasburg I love the most
is the quality of their bags they have
their bags created in a gorgeous little
Spanish Factory the workmanship and care
and attention that goes into every
single bag is incredible the quality is
always at the highest standard the
fabrics are beautiful nothing is
scrimped on so when you buy a strawberry
bag you get the quality of bags that
have an astronomical price tag it's just
beautiful and it's unique and it's
special and that's why I've always loved
strawberry so they lose my line before I
tell you about every single piece in the
collection there are 12 different items
in the collection before I tell you all
about them I want to just show you a
little behind the scenes that we've put
together of when I went up to Edinburgh
and chatted more with the team and went
through design ideas and colorways and
also I want to show the behind the
scenes of the photo shoot that we shot
as well which is for the banner images
and the images on the website and also
you may have seen them on my Instagram
as well dove now so I just wanna kinda
show you the behind the scenes of what
happened what we've been doing and yeah
what's been going on
so that is what I've been up to for the
past few months very secretly also I
wanted to keep this a big surprise so
I'm sorry for all the secretiveness but
I hope you're gonna be so excited let me
show you more about each of the back
okay first of all let's just start off
with the overall idea of the collection
I could choose any color of back that I
wanted to create and my initial thoughts
was there's got to be a purple in there
I started my blog with purple hair it's
one of those like signature colors for
me and also a big fan of purple but I'm
also a huge fan of pink it's kind of
like that nude pink shade is always what
I'm wearing on my lips like what I'm
wearing now I kind of wanted a cooler
that matched that a nude pink something
you could wear with everything with your
dark blue coats of your black coats you
could wear it with whites with reds with
different types of Blues that literally
would go with so many things such a
gorgeous neutral shade so that's why we
came up with the rose shade so I've
labeled this rose cuz I think that's the
best way to describe it school away and
then we decided on a beautiful rich plum
shade initially I was thinking maybe a
burgundy but I just thought there are so
many burgundy backs out there not as
many Browns create such a rich plum
shade and absolutely love it there's
something so mature so sophisticated so
grown-up and yet so wearable with this
long shade I feel like for any of you
guys who prefer black bags you would
probably love this because it's not got
so much cooler than it's in your face
and it's you crazy but it's kind of on
that same spectrum kind of like very
deep very rich colors and it'll go with
so many thing
for any of you guys that prefer
something a bit brighter a bit more
neutral a bit more pink and cute then
this is only in the status spectrum this
is serosa rose and plum then it came to
the hardware stressfully and known for
gorgeous gold hardware the gold straps
and this very kind of signature gold bar
that they have on the majority of their
bags that's kind of what they're known
for it's a signature trend and I was
like well I love the gold but I wear
silver and I love silver and the
freshness of a silver shade it sounds
like can we do silver hardware and they
were just like yes absolutely let's
let's go for it
and I absolutely love the way that
silver matches with the rose and with
the plum I think the combination of the
shade and the contrast is absolutely
perfect like I literally I'm so happy so
each of the bags has the silver bar
across the front it has a silver
strawberry embossed logo here and the
top it has two silver rivets on each
side and the silver chain this means
that you can wear the bag either with
two chains like this tube chain and it
just fits perfectly just over your arm
it's a perfect length or if you want to
wear it crossbody you can just put down
on the chains I always put the front one
down and then you can wear it crossbody
instead so this is in the Rose silver
hardware and then on the inside it goes
fully through with the leather and then
there is a burgundy suede to the inside
each bag has two compartments each one
is sort of split down the middle this
has two compartments of equal size and
at the back there is a little pocket
that you could put your card put seats
anything you like in there and then just
on the pocket you can just see here you
can feel stress bright in the fro logo
panel just there as well and that's on
every single one at the back then they
have this little magnetic closure on
each one which just means that when you
push the flap back underneath the bar it
just kind of grips onto that the thing I
love about these with the quality of the
fit perfectly so that you're never kind
of walking around and silly this just
like flaps up like it fits perfectly so
you're never going to get that and then
having that magnetic closure ensures
that
it's not gonna happen either so your bag
always stays that perfectly secure like
this which is what I love so much about
it so this is the east-west standard
size you can fit so much in here man
your umbrella your camera phone
loads of lipsticks like this literally
so much room for everything it's a
perfect day bag perfect work bag
honestly it fits so much without being
too over top you can still wear this
crossbody and it's a perfect size I wear
backset bigger than this crossbody it's
just such a versatile bag and then in
the plum again the contrast of the
silver against the Plumber is just
exquisite if you ask me I think it's
absolutely perfect and then it goes
through same color into there and then a
nice deep burgundy suede again and then
the panel on the inside absolutely love
them so for the east-west bag in the
plum and the rose this is 475 pounds
just as a little side note on pricing
before I carry on the rest of the bags
obviously the quality and the standard
of all of the bags in this collection
are of the exact same as the usual
strawberry quality there's no difference
this is just my own collaboration range
so the prices are in fitting with the
usual strawberry price tags and then you
have the mix we wanted to do a mixed bag
with both of the colors so the plum and
the rose could go through the entire
collection so for this bag we wanted to
have the rose as the body and then the
plum as the flap all the way over the
back and then when you open it up inside
that colorway continues as well and then
into the burgundy on the inside I just
think the color combination together is
beautiful and for anyone that can't
decide between which one they like the
most
again I thought it's a really lovely
kind of halfway pony to get a little bit
of both
again the colorways because they are
such easy shades to wear you can wear
this bag with so many things and not
worry that maybe because it's
multicolored it's gonna be two
contrasting or two different to what
you're wearing I also feel like it'll go
is so so much and it's just it's a bit
more of a statement a little bit more
going on but I think the colors with the
rose and then the plum over the top and
then the bright silver it just works so
beautifully together now because this
bag is duo colored and obviously
take a little bit more craftsmanship to
put this together with the two tones
this bag is 515 pounds okay now let's
move on to the mini for these are the
east-west mini bags again in the road
and again in plumb exactly the same as
the larger bags it's just that these are
mini and the other ones of standard size
the exact same colorway so so this is in
the Rhodes
Rose all over silver hardware again
exactly the same just as a test for any
of you guys that like well what can it
fit inside it looks quite tiny actually
it fits quite a lot so this is my iPhone
8 plus and it fits perfectly with a case
on it right inside the back which is
another reason why I absolutely love
this bag the fact it fits so snug is
just a match made in heaven so it's
perfect I mean I often take out mine
east-west mini with my phone in it I can
just about fit my camera in here couple
lipsticks on either side a lip liner and
my carbs and I'm good to go with this
it's actually it does fit a lot more
than you're probably expecting so this
is in the rose and then this is the
east-west mini in plum again exactly the
same plum all-over beautiful silver
hardware so it's just personal
preference whether you love the deeper
tones or whether you love the lighter
tones and now for these two in a mini
size these are both 395 pounds and the
last bag this is the rose and plum mix
in the mini I guess I just wanted to
give you guys a really great selection
process so whether you like a large bag
a tinier bag and then in every single
color way de si can make the choice that
you really really love the most
again the color combination is so cute
and in the mini pfizer is just so
adorable
it just depends what kind of size you
prefer so I've shown you every single
one this is the inside with the silver
and again because this is duo collet
this one is 425 pounds okay we're not
done there though so those are the six
different bags then I wanted to create
some more accessories to go along with
them so first of all I want to show you
the pouches for me whenever I
take out a handbag I always have a pouch
inside my bag where I put my lipsticks
my tissues my hand sanitizer everything
that I need fat Dave his concealer are
sponges or anything I keep it inside a
pouch just for hygiene reasons just
thought the ease of it just having them
all in one little bag just makes life so
much easier so now it's become a habit
of mine I always have a pouch inside my
bag so I said to strawberry is there any
way we could create pouches that will go
inside each of the different sizes of
bags and they've never really created
pouches before so they were totally
excited about creating something a bit
different and that totally suited the
collection so we've come up with two
sizes of pouches I'll show you these two
first yeah so we've got the standard
size and also the mini now these we've
made something fit perfectly inside each
of the backs so that mini pouch fits
perfectly there's a little duo teen with
the mini bag right there and then the
standard pouch so I'm gonna make sure
that I show you if you can definitely
feels work this fits perfectly inside a
standard size east-west as well so I
just love the fact that these just go
perfectly with the bags if you did want
to have a pouch to go with the bag to
keep things in line can I do perfect if
not you can just use these as their own
little clutches which i think is just
amazing I can use them for both or if
you prefer to you can use it as a little
clutch which is why I wanted to create
these little wrist straps as well so
that if you did want to take it out with
you and just have it it's a little
clutch bag it's super safe and secure
around your wrist and also this size in
the standard size again this fits your
iPhone 8 plus and in here you'd also
better put like a lipstick card keys
you know lip liner those loads of room
in there for a few extra things and then
you built a ski that is a little clutch
for the night as well now these come in
two different colorways there is a full
plum this is plum all over on the wrist
strap silver hardware for the sit and
then on the inside it's a burgundy and
then it has in the fro strawberry logo
on every single one and the same to the
front I mean how amazing my brand it on
an accessory like insane it comes in
this colorway
Oh
it comes in rows to the front with
silver and brass on there and then on
the back is the plot
so it's either in the mix shades again
with the plumb wrist strap or it's in
the full plot against wanted to kind of
mix it up and give you guys a bit more
choice the standard size pouches are 95
pounds oh there is the mini version that
goes from the mini bags and again
anything fax saying pull away and every
single one has the logo patch on the
inside and also the silver logo on the
very very front all girls love them I
think the mini ones were perfect as well
as little money wallet so you could put
your cash in here your kind you notice
the cards just keep it as a lovely
little money holder I think they would
just work beautifully for that and for
the price of the mini pouches these are
75 pounds and then the final accessory
we have card holders again Strasburg
never done card holders before and I
love card holders that I don't use
purses now I only use card holders and
every single bag that I wear same with
Alex he's exactly the same we've kind of
both abandoned our wallets and purses so
I absolutely wanted to do a card haul
that would go with the bags and go with
the pouches so these are the two and
they're both just in contrasting ways so
this one is a majority plum with the
silver logo over the front then it goes
into the pink with plum stitching so
it's contrasting stitching and it has
five compartments it's one two the
middle one three four five so five
little slots to put your card inside and
then the opposite version if majority
rows with a silver and then this one has
the Rose stitching as well for gorgeous
contrast and again five card areas alex
has already said that he wants to steal
this from me he wants this one because
it I mean he loves the colours and he's
just super proud of me so he really
wants this one so I think I'm gonna help
this one so we have matching card hold
it I feel so proud I actually feel so
emotional to see
my brand name alongside such an
incredible brand on my own line
accessories like I can't believe it I'm
just absolutely over the moon so those
are the additional accessories alongside
the bags there are 12 pieces in total
two different size of bags two different
sizes of pouches two card holders and in
each in varying color ways so hopefully
lots of choice you guys depending on
what you like the most I cannot actually
wait to hear what you guys think I am so
proud of collection I am so thrilled
that I actually got this opportunity to
