excited about this as hall as I am I'm
extremely excited it's been a long time
a lot of you guys been asking for one
and it was yeah just about town that
when I saw sand did a bit of a haul
again I love doing these by the way I'm
really sorry about this little stain on
my brand-new jumper sorry that's my boob
um I think I've learned over and
accidentally got a bit of my lipstick on
it
and now it's it's drying it's just like
a wet patch stain but a lot of time no
one has time for that to dry so to be
dry but in this video I'm sure let's put
that on silent right let's get into this
a sauce holds a lot of things here I've
got a Oh got a bus and I have two bags
so let's just kick off with the biggest
bag I'm just gonna dive in and let's go
for it there's no rhyme or reason to
this whole I was just feeling very
uninspired about everything in my
cupboards in my wardrobe and just felt
like I need something new so I went on a
big big bitch okay first thing I found
was this pretty awesome very oversized
very cool denim jacket like trucker
jacket from a sauce obviously it's
covered in these cute little pearls all
over a lot of frame a lot of nice
dressing and a very cool oversized fit
this may look ridiculous on me but I
really really liked it okay so style
this over jumper that you'll see later
in the hall and I really like this
rolled up with the sleeves and sort of
pop collar hair tucked in quite like
it's quite cute but with its leaves down
this looks a little bit too big for me a
bit oversized and a bit too I mean
grungy yeah it's quite good G I don't
know if that's really me now maybe few
years ago but I mean I like it I think
it's very pretty little pearls and
whatnot I'm just not sure I could have
to roll up the sleeves and you know
do little bit more to it I'm not sure
we're also dealing with natural light
today because I really like the idea of
having a bit natural light in my video
for once so I'm sorry if this goes
little bit right a little bit dim I'll
try and keep up top of that this just
caught my eye as soon as I saw it on the
side I don't know why it's not Christmas
yet but there's something about it it
was so absolutely beautiful this velvet
teal meets forest to green looks very
teal on the screen very very tail it's
not that to you it's much more forest
green than that but this is beautiful
velvet it's got some mesh inserts over
the bust and it goes around the back as
well beautiful tiny spaghetti straps
and I'm pretty sure this is a MIDI link
as well it's quite long but I thought it
could be an absolutely beautiful piece
to wear are not coming holiday or a trip
we shall see I absolutely love this
dress it's beautiful
it fits generally lovely it's just too
big it's too big I'm so good is the
smallest size that they do and it's
absolutely gorgeous - like if I was
going on like a date night and holiday
and just more glam and beautiful in the
back is I would have to say if any of
you guys wanna buy this I would size
down one or by two and then several back
opposite I would say yeah size down
because I'm probably like extra extra
small in their voice beautiful stain is
really annoying me I can just see it I
love this new jump by the way this is an
a soft spot it's brand new
so technically a hold item yeah I love
it
beautiful cashmere nail I'll sit leave
it link down below right next piece I
like a good jumpsuit and I saw this one
and thought it could potentially look
really nice it has this mesh top section
has dark inserts over the boobs polka
dot over the mesh actually feels that
amazing quality to be fair and high neck
as I seem to love and down into ordinary
black pumps so if this fits like a dream
it'll be great if it doesn't fit well
then no jumpsuits so hit and miss
depending on whether or not they fit you
in a flattering way or not so fingers
crossed because that could be a lovely
all of the carcass
because keeping the water love this so
much it's so flattering it's so fitted
the quality is absolutely beautiful
it doesn't feel really thin like his
thumb through it it's a last piece in
this bag was another jumper because get
into water now well actually we're
nowhere near often but it feels like it
this is a very pretty embellished jumper
it could be a little dressed down for me
and but I don't know I just I really
liked it on the model seeing it now in
person I don't think I was advocate on
it it's got a lot of lace work over me
fight lace
Oh from mesh and it looks like double
layered very interesting but we'll try
it and see what we think about one is
this is nice not overly amazing it's not
blowing me away I'm not in love with it
and this is quite pricey think this is
the most expensive of jumpers so don't
so don't think it'll be keeping this
I'll be honest I mean it is lovely and
it the quality is beautiful like a
cotton it's gorgeous it's just not me by
the way this is gonna be a huge hole is
about 17 items here to get through I'm
very sorry
okay next bag this is very me this is
very very very me check out this color
o-m-g hello raspberry red welcome to the
house is it me or does this look like a
self-portrait dress it's not I tell you
it's not it's actually a different brand
but it looked very self-portrait and I
was digging it a lot it's about a third
of the price of a usual self portrait
dress and I know that I usually do like
to buy the real thing but I've not seen
self portrait do this color and I really
like it try that together so nice I love
the color and pretty cut out it's very
very flattering I think everybody wore
his little bit short like if I was going
out maybe like dancing partying perfect
if I'm going for a meal I know this is
gonna ride up and all my thighs going on
show so bad my mind pretty gonna be
stood most
you know it's gorgeous I mean it's quite
so much short the answer I don't mind it
too much with it being a dress wrap and
I'll sit like a jacket so it's very very
pretty and it's not sure if it's a
little bit too short for me so yeah this
bag on you have two things in it
actually but this shirt when I saw it I
really liked it a lot
this feels like a very it's a crepe
fabric I'm too sure on that yellow now I
don't wear yellow does not go with my
hair but it's an absolutely beautiful
shirt it's got a lot going on and it's
that very kind of statement shirt that
you probably just dress down with a pair
of like black skinny if and you tuck it
in a very cool pair of ankle boots and
just make it look very like a statement
shirt with a very ordinary chilled out
look often I think that sits at the back
actually no zips from Oh interesting
oh okay that's cool so opening out a bit
of a v-neck thing going on you never
know I might really like it okay I'm
awesome there feel a little bit like
Harry Styles in this really there's a
lot going on and I kind of wish that it
wasn't yellow me is a different color
probably like it more than but it's the
are nice features of it like but it kind
of pulls in at the bottom roof she's in
at the bottom to pull it and the sleeves
are beautiful of the mesh it's just not
the right color tone for me but I think
for so many people work wear piece just
not moving on to the box
cute little thing I bought I bought a
bra this turf looked really miss me
though I really hope you can still see
me with this lighting situation I
actually have a light here and you won't
even know it's so bright in here right
now I quite like that though this is
beautiful so beautiful I love these what
size is this extra small cup that looks
big for an extra small but very pretty
you never know it could fit really nice
I just really love these very peach nude
lace completely unwired just fabric
brass they just feel really nice to wear
when you have when you have little boobs
like I do and you can wear anything you
really like it me still stay pretty
great and oh I like wear anything abroad
you know why I'm wearing it like what
it's going on today I am just in a very
very good mood I thought that was
beautiful that were this beautiful lace
bit down here
I'm probably not going to show you this
on guys I'm sorry okay next up okay I
got this little notebook I saw it's just
like a date planner just says all the
different days I just thought it would
be really good to have on my desk and
start writing list rather than have a
notebook so I don't even bother putting
this comes be sat on my desk day by day
week by week and actually do some work I
really like that actually
that looks great I'm very happy with
that it's like a fiber so pleased very
pleased back to Nick oh god this is
gonna be such a long hauls now what this
is cute
oh yeah like this high neck mesh floral
top I need something to wear over my
gorgeous do your bra so you can see the
straps through it but and I saw this and
thought it could work quite nicely just
turn this down and make it into a cute
little real neck and then have my
gorgeous your bra underneath it just
soft peering through but very cool top
loaded up I really like that I'll show
you that with the do bra just so you can
get an idea okay I've done this in two
sections so for this won't being at the
top it's so nice actually it's really
sweet it's good enough quality it feels
nice you know I mean it doesn't feel the
same quality as that beautiful jumpsuit
earlier but still looking enough and you
just see my Christian Dior bra
underneath it which is really sweet and
I'm just took this down I mean it goes
quite dark when he's got double up the
mesh but I'm really quite like that
almost looks like I've got a choker here
and the black bra but it looks really
nice and I've just tucked it in but it's
not too long anyway just quite a simple
piece but quite nice fun to have in a
wardrobe for if I needed a bit more can
see through and match oh this was a very
pretty bodysuit know that I just find a
high-neck and this is a little bit
floral though beautiful mesh sleeves and
gorgeous fluting on the end of the
sleeves into more of a like Odyssey at
the very bottom and yeah that's very
pretty actually I wasn't sure about this
at first it looked almost little bit too
bohemian but I think that will look
beautiful
very very John Breaux please I really
wanted to hopefully send some bits of
this back but I'm not sure now I think
it's so beautiful I love the sleeves on
this
and the detail I think it's so so pretty
I've paired it with the highest kind of
jeans that I have just to try and cover
this band and even these aren't quite
high enough but I kind of feel like I
could live with that because you can't
really see they're too badly you can see
a bit here but this looks like part of
the top and I feel like I like it that
much that I could get over that it's
very pretty very feminine and I think it
would go a lot of things this dress have
put my basket because it's something
that looked very and felt it looked very
luxurious and cool and quite quirky or
it was they can put the opposite thought
I kind of liked actually seeing it like
this there's so much going on this dress
has patterns for days it's a big mixture
of patterns and prints it has this
ribboning down the side it could look
very cool or not I'm not too sure yet I
don't know it just it just gave me vibes
it's like I'm gonna bit Dolce something
a bit Gucci just something a bit
interesting and it's just to keep little
mini a bit of a longer style a line mini
will see this dress I actually love it
more than I thought I would the patterns
in the prints and the colors I really
really like I think on it just looks
really cool really unique it's got a lot
of very cool features to it I suppose
pair of black stilettos just to kind of
not play up as much color on the feet
but I really like it too much list of
that good so yeah big big find this I
think I could wear this to a lot of very
cool little occasions date night nights
out events yeah okay that color is
freaking insane I love this color
I'm not usually one for red but I am
branching into it recently and quite
enjoying it they are adorable they are
absolutely adorable that red is
absolutely beautiful I love them already
hope you fit gorgeous pair look at this
this is very Megan ellaby
thank for very Megan ellaby I could in
fact she probably how these these
ruffles around the pockets and around
the ankles
very sweet please fit me this is
six which should fit I love them too bit
I really hope that works
the trousers are so cute they are
adorable I love the ruffling and lovely
effects you seem to fit really really
nicely I feel that it's a little bit too
much fabric potentially around this area
but I feel like it's not too much I can
live with it I feel like the quite
flattering yeah feel like they fit my
figure quite known for their to check in
the mirror I think these are good I like
them a lot I like this whole outfit to
the black in the red it's not color
combination I would you should do but I
really like it
another jumper because I'm in the market
for jumpers at all times very sweet a
very low roll neck and I love that
fabric that is very very cute very cute
I like that so I've got a new hair I'm
like yeah I can't check it out goodbye
sunshine
I will around put some light that better
think it is umm yeah love that a lot
that is very very nice just run this
gorgeous jumper on over the red as well
see how the chords go in a real I get
the actual jumper is beautiful
everything I really like in this whole I
really wanted to send a few things back
it's gonna cost a fortune
I really really liked everything it just
fits through the night I like this
little bit more of a cropped length it's
not too like me it's not really corrupt
but it's not too long not too baggy it
just fits nicely I like the round neck
yes another winner that's by the way
guys when I do my Asus holes I do like
to mix up with different price ranges I
mean I'd pick anything regardless of
price range as you know I'll be honest
there are a lot of things in this hole
that are a little more privacy I'll be
honest but there were new pieces that
I've seen this really fell in love with
and I couldn't not get them because
they're in the more slightly high price
range there are some things that are a
bit less by the way obviously but I for
example this this is a little bit less
but quite liked this on the model this
is an extra small we'll see but it is a
matey's a MIDI yeah
midi-length dress it's almost got a
pencil skirt feel into a body and it's
just a full dress but and it's got this
cool orangie thing around the COFF
she knows that with a very cool set of
high red boots I don't own red boots
maybe I need some red boots
that would look very cool wouldn't it or
I mean orange boots even
but I've never seen any orange boots
around okay guys I'm onto a winner here
all of this as well everything I've
tried on so far trying on all the
dresses but I'm in love with this this
would be such a good work white piece if
you worked in office or that kind of
environment we'll use something a little
bit more kind of dressed up in love when
you little like stilettos and things
like that but for me I would most
meetings we've having AdWords to some
different things I'm in love that it
fits nicely without being too clingy
it just feels real nice and fitted I
could wear black heels heels big big big
fan and this I think was one of the
least expensive of the dresses so this
jumper looks very similar to at last and
they're getting now get into water now
this is very sweet though bit more
oversized very sweet fabric though I
love a little fabric crochet style
knitting it's very sweet lovely little
bit love the wash after that yeah I
really like this jumper I was putting it
on thinking I'm not gonna like this as
much as maybe the blue one but actually
it's very different in that it's more
crop the sort of goes down a little bit
it sized you to style the cut of this so
it's got my crop feel it's a bit more
baggy in bat wing Yee almost he just
looks really cute I don't know what do
you guys think let me know on this once
I'm not too sure however this jumper Oh
stat it right up my nose this guy's I
told you about the red thing Jimmy I can
pull this off maybe we look we like a
dark red lip this would look big
wouldn't it really like that guys a lot
a lot a lot a lot that is very sweet
yes the majority of the normal neck you
know me this is an easy one Keyshawn
sweet I freaking love it the color is
awesome if it feels a bit oversized
it's so nice to keep everything and one
last one oh yeah yeah I was like
one last jump sir for the road very
beautiful quality ouch this is very
lovely quality it's just another NIT
light grey net extra small size a little
more inexpensive a little less expensive
than some of the other pieces the way I
show you these things what am I even
doing yeah lovely
I like this again it's not really
blowing me away I think it's a really
easy nice jumper a lot of people would
love this it would be super easy on
throng with everything it looks quite
cute / feels and easy-to-use do I have
to know I feel like half jumpers very
similar maybe a little bit more so
that's it guys 17 different pieces I
think there that I bought obviously I'll
be sending quite a lot back that not
keen on after I've tried them on I
haven't obviously yet tried them on all
those outtakes I did after this
