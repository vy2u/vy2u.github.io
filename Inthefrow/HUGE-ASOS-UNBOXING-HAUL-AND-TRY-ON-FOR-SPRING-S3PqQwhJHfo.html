favorite other videos to film as you
guys know if you're brand new here for a
sauce haul is something I've been doing
it for years I love a sauce it's just so
quick it's so easy I ordered these
yesterday at like 4 o'clock they arrived
like a few hours ago and like 3 o'clock
it's just so fast I love it so with us
going on a few trips coming up had
somebody to get some last-minute things
again my last-minute things I know that
I did my best he does my asshole I'll
leave that link down below if you didn't
see it but a few the things I sent back
see weren't quite the right size so I
wanted to do another like big spring a
sauce haul and I was really like I'm
just feeling really inspired that's what
it's gonna be
I've just been filming another video a
net a port a mulberry haul video as well
and under SERPs
that's me today the sun's out and was
feeling really happy so I thought I'd
film this as well so let's just get into
this got two big big boxes filled with a
lot of things so I'm just gonna try on
as we go unbox try on haul with you ok
the first thing I'm pulling out of this
box is a bikini top and I already have
this bikini top but I top it in the
balconette version balconette exactly
face it when I wanted to buy it I also
wanted to buy it in this strapless
version and they didn't have it and they
just got it they've just got it in so
I've got it in a 30 day for me cuz
that's my usual size so that does feel
like it'll fit quite nicely I just love
it I love the color I just really like
the print and I think it looks really
sweet and it was like 16 pounds you
can't go wrong I'm not gonna try it on
for you guys oh maybe I will next thing
in here that isn't mightily squished I
just really wanted a Sun Hat to protect
my head I do already have one in a
different color but I just fancy getting
something a little more new and
different
so what size have I got this census and
a small that does not suit me does it no
I was really hoping this would look
really cute and I'd be able to wear it
all the way around India and look really
sweet but it just doesn't you know what
though every time I do this and I don't
like castles and fits you guys are
always like No
I love it I'm just looking at the mirror
here behind mints not I'm not blown away
by this no I can't make that way
next up I won't prepare of shoes and
I'll be honest the majority my shoe
collection is always usually designer
I'm just a bit of a design a shoe girl a
lot of people love bags I left my shoes
I think the most but for this trip I
thought these a little too really quite
comfortable
oh yeah do you know what it is comfy
it's actually really confident oh I like
those you guys can't see oh no I can't
even lift my leg I've got such saw like
from the gym
see the cute right try on the other one
yeah they're really cute um I think
these are like 12 quid guys if I'm just
walking around the streets if I'm just
in a little awesome with me a little
pair of shorts I'm not taking any jeans
to India with me they're gonna be really
sweet I really like those a lot they're
adorable
easy peasy shoes I can get these
battered up like they can get dirty and
I'll go over it okay
the next thing in here I absolutely love
this okay
this is a little sleep set not
necessarily just this tricky there just
the need to have just as an a little
cami set this is so pretty it's a little
red camisole top that has some frilly
bits around the edge that's adorable and
it comes with the matching shorts it's
adorable little waist band they are so
cute absolutely adorably cute they're
gonna be great they'll be great for the
trip another great for up towards the
Silver Spring yeah they are hip they're
an absolute keep her don't think you
need to see me and that either to kind
of get the gist of it I'll leave like a
picture of the model wearing it here on
the screen so you can see that right
okay on to the big box okay first thing
I can see here is little t-shirt with
some ruffle sleeves as I recall ah it's
very similar to what I'm wearing
that's probably why I ordered this yeah
that's Tryon sweet little white tea very
sweet feminine sleeves quite like okay I
get I know it's quite simple I'm really
sorry my hair isn't done
today I'm just I'm just really enjoying
this very low-maintenance look yeah I
like it I think that's really sweet
I'll tuck it into some into my shorts it
almost has a vest vibe and then it's got
the sleeves but it was like 12 pounds I
think
12 14 pounds yeah let me like that like
it just remembered I like the mini of
coffee oh I feel that it doesn't taste
amazing okay so this is a hip I like
this a lot
I can't this one now listen I remember I
had to get this in an 8 so it run out in
6 but I just shows how much I liked it
the shampoo on there oh boy it's in
petite so maybe it won't be too bad not
too bad it's like a wrap top is this
gonna even cover a bra this is actually
from boohoo I haven't ordered from
boohoo in a very very long time but I
kind of like this style um okay that's
my bra that's my bra I don't quite get
it oh I'm going all out summery with
this one look how beautiful that color
yellow is oh it's beautiful and it all
comes in the waist pulls in yeah it just
pulls in at the waist to give a point a
flattering fit around the waist gorgeous
fabric it's like a jacquard heart
patterned top almost feels really silky
as well that's beautiful with my new
Navy shorts oh this will look really
really pretty
yes great choice no I went all out with
these oranges and yellows are really
really good I'm never been orange and
yellows the theme right now I kinda like
it and I love the colors and I love how
airy this will be so wonderfully area
for India I'll feel comfortable and
covered up was very lightweight lovely
fabric can I feel like maybe take a
chance on this cuz I actually really
like it if I wear my hair up because I'm
gonna wear not most at the time and the
heat I do really like
lovely coal at its core an absolutely
beautiful kind of wish that this was a
little bit more open and relaxed and you
could wear it a bit more off shoulder
though I submit I think that would look
really nice but overall chilly I'm a big
fan I'm a big fan of this and I think
it's very very holiday appropriate like
it okay one last top I'm just doing the
tops first so that I don't have to
change out of my trousers
looks like alternate insert oh okay I
don't quite get how this goes on okay so
this is that top I literally just film
it hence why I've got the next thing on
and I realize it goes it filming so I'll
talk about this in a talk about this in
a second but this top I actually really
quite like it I think it's so feminine
and pretty it's got a lot of details for
the price of it as well like cutout
details here and here really gorgeous
fabric actually I mean it's not too bad
in terms of this wasn't here I wouldn't
be too bad it's a very feminine it's
yeah it's pretty double actually I
actually think I really like this as a
more maybe evening top just so ornate
though although I think I need to think
about this format what I would pair this
with I'm not sure the next thing is this
tulle skirt let me see this is a skirt I
just thought that colors and how pretty
it was it would look beautiful and
whimsical in pictures I think it's
really pretty actually not with this top
I think that this top it's too much but
if I paired it with just an ordinary one
of the little white tees with the cute
sleeves maybe I should do that now maybe
it needs to be literally a tiny camisole
okay this is hard for me to style and I
thought it would be yeah I reckon just a
really tiny bodysuit then it's like a
white body suit sucked into this they
look really nice
but I love the color I think it's it'll
be really really pretty I'll go a little
warm a little warm but now a jumpsuit
this is really gorgeous
it's lightweight it's beautiful fabric
it's a really pretty print okay
that's bed it fun
but hey justice rejigging my cameras now
alex is making a noise yeah I really
really like this I just think it's gonna
be very pretty
I don't I feel so it fits it like fits
really really well and then sell trick
it just comes down like above ankle
length it's kind of grazing my abs like
here so just with some cute little shoes
yeah this is a yes guys I really really
like this I think this might be one the
most expensive pieces in this hole but I
know I'm gonna get so much wear out of
this put them in India it's a good one I
love it okay
more yellow I got some more yellow ah
AlterNet pastel yellow dress I think I'm
gonna like this oh my god I love this
dress I am obsessed with this hum out of
this dress this dress is absolutely
beautiful look how cute this dress is
absolutely adorable and it's so
affordable as well I think I'm sure in
like 25 quinn's minutes my eggs are sewn
yeah I've got a gastro hat then yeah
it's too big I mean it's just too bit
too big very bougie oh yeah this kind of
thing okay massive hit this is this is
great oh my god sorry another yellow
it's yellow woman run right now oh my
god what you what's that no gelatine in
it oh you got to show me treat why hmm
who needs gelatine you know anything up
there mmm this one's gorgeous wow this
is a wide-leg jumpsuit with band ow from
tying bow boob area okay I'm pretty sure
this is how it goes it's not pretty
although if you like just breathe out a
bit this might just come straight don't
know maybe not though I mean still up
here at the back so take some movement
and I think I could probably do a better
job actually a tine it's a little
tighter no it's actually really
beautiful see so it's really
like wide-leg style you know I'm really
like this to think you look absolutely
beautiful
in India let me know what you think guys
I really like this I think this is
really really pretty it's gonna have a
lot of yellow though on this trip aren't
I
a lot a lot a lot a lot of yellow this
would look beautiful red right next one
another dress oh my gosh it's so pretty
this is absolutely gorgeous isn't it
what do you think the color the style
Alyssa's kind of was going forward that
all the tulle skirt and I think it was
prefer this I think I want to send back
the other tool skirt and just go for
this because you're like an evening if
we're going for a meal Oh beautiful the
way it's catching the light is
absolutely stunning I love it I think
it's beautiful
honestly I think it's not know one of my
best ever like successful hauls I've
ever done and one of the beginning now
this I saw and thought it was so
adorable and just really quite gimmicky
but I've seen a lot of these kind of
bags and this one was just really ornate
and it kind of reminded me of India it's
like this and then it on the inside is
this beige little sack so you can put
all your stuff inside that and then this
closes oh so cute I really like it with
this dress
I think that's adorable guys what do you
think of this I know it's very different
for me but I just saw it's a strip and
if any like little summary holidays it's
adorable
like a little bird cage yeah that's
sweet and the last thing I got was a
pair of off again they were super
affordable kind of similar vibes to the
last ones
okay so cuties it's very sweet
again these were so affordable as well
oh they're really comfortable this is
the way to do it
so later like oh they're great they are
great
they'll just be so calm they're really
comfortable they don't feel like the
really crappy basement either
they feel really comfy I love them and
still affordable again just with so much
short C's will look mega cubed sold sold
and that's it guys for this pretty huge
haul
however honestly I feel like this was so
successful I pretty much love the
jumpsuit the two yellow dresses this
dress look camisole set a low to the
tops that cute little bag that is so
cute just was like a really cute like
gimmicky bag for for like your evening
out I need some holiday so I honestly
feel like my I'm totally soaked now got
two new pairs of shoes in there that I
love and they're just so affordable as
well but I can totally ruin these if I
