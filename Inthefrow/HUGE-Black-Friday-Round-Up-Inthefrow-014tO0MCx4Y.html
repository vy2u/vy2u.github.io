random video I don't usually post it on
the Friday so I post on Wednesday since
some days I see probably now and
Sunday's video is coming up in a couple
of days but I really wanted to film this
to let all of you guys know who don't
follow my blog that I have done a huge
huge Black Friday sales and discount
codes blog post over on in the fro com
the only reason I'm really mentioning it
here is because I've spent days putting
this blog post together and I've gone
through all of my favorite online stores
like estas misguided Topshop Nessa
Porter Selfridges so there's a big mix
of high end as well as lower end high
street stores as well and I've gone
through and I've chosen all of my
favorite products in accessories shoes
bags clothing home wear pieces potential
Christmas gifts and I've listed them all
in visual form with easy click throughs
so you can get straight to anything and
buy it and also all of the discount
codes you will need for Black Friday and
this also will probably be the same for
Cyber Monday
in fact I'll make sure that if there any
other codes for Cyber Monday everything
will be updated so yeah so I just really
wanted to mention it quickly because I
have spent ages on it and I wanted to
make sure that all of you guys found the
blog post to I would have loved to have
got a lot of these products and showing
you them in a hole or a try on and
showing you that way but that just would
not have been possible and would have
cost me a lot of money just to do that
so that's why I thought if I just do a
video just to show you where exactly can
go to the blog post and you can see all
the products yourself there then that
might be worth doing as well so that's
why I'm letting you know here so as you
may all know my blog is just in the fro
calm or I will leave a direct link just
down below straight to the blog post
have a look through hopefully you will
love some of the pieces that I've picked
out I've already picked out a few pieces
including this I only bought this for
the day when I was putting the bits
together of what I need to buy that
straight away but yet hopefully it's
helpful I really really hope you like it
make sure you leave me a comment on that
blog post if you do come across and have
a look and yeah I'll see you on Sunday
as always bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
