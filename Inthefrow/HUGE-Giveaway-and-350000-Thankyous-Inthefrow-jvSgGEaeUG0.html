thank you video pretty much this is what
this video is going to be the biggest
thank you video when i first started
youtube I mean everyone always says it
but when I honestly first started
YouTube it was just a by channel to my
blog I was a blogger and I wanted to
kind of create videos alongside that cuz
i loved youtube and from there i never
thought i would gain a hundred or a
thousand followers nevermind 350
thousand followers I cannot fathom how
many people that is I'm just so grateful
and so thankful for everyone who decided
to hit the subscribe button and come
back and constantly support me and leave
comments constantly of love and support
and interest and and it yes it just
means the absolute world to me i cannot
believe it so this is a huge thank you a
month or so ago i decided i wanted to do
something a bit bigger than this and
just plan a giveaway because last time
in at the give way it was gosh if no
it's been like a year ago now and so
many of you went to them you loved it
and i'm pretty sure that the channel has
grown by double in that time there's a
lot more of you now so hopeless giveaway
will be loved even even more because my
channel is obviously a beauty fashion
life bit of everything i figured a nice
beauty good way it would be a good way
to go again so this is going to be a
huge 350 thousand followers giveaway
this is the box oh oh god it's in one
those huge royal mail sending boxes just
to give you a gist of the size so and
it's packed absolutely full and I've
been gathering things for a while stick
them in the box getting it ready to go
and I just wanted something sort of big
and exciting to give it away for as soon

hundred fifty thousand followers I
thought perfect i will say the biggest

could win this easily worldwide entries
so wherever you are in the world i will
send you this box no age requirements
because these are all this lovely
products that anyone could win this
nothing aight restrictive on this behalf
so how do you enter i rack my brains for
a while about the best way to do this
and i honestly think the best ways to do
it the same way I did in my last
giveaway which is via roflcopter what i
will do is I'm going to create a blog
post on my blog for people to enter down
below I'll leave a link for blog posts
go on to their it will be a rafflecopter
form little box I'll be lots of
different ways for you to enter entries
such as follow me on instagram follow me
on twitter follow me on bloglovin so you
can keep up with my blog so it's just
all easy things that you might want
to do anyway but we'll give you an entry
give way will run for one week and then
after the week i will get rafflecopter
to randomly choose the winner so it's
completely fair it will just be
literally on a number system on
rafflecopter and i'll choose the winner
after I'm verified everything on there
so I may have to make sure that if you
said you follow me Instagram I'll have
to go check and all that kind of thing
just so it's completely verified and
fair for everyone that has entered
correctly see if I know I will tweet you
from my app in the fro Twitter account
you will not be contacted in any other
way you will not be emailed on YouTube
you will not be emailed by me before I
tweet you so I'll tweet you so if you
think you've won't go and see if I've
tweeted you an hour long so if you also
go on to the blog post the rafflecopter
forum will say the name of the winner so
you'll know cuz I know last time I did a
giveaway someone try to sabotage it and
started emailing everyone from a rogue
account to looks like dotting the throw
something that wasn't in the throw and
lots of people thought they'd won and it
was really heartbreaking when I've seen
so many of you be so excited about the
giveaway not emailing anyone i'm just
going to tweet you and as soon as you
tweet me back i'll be able to start
chatting with you about email addresses
i'm emailing you and then get your
address to send you this in the post but
i have put this together as no more than
a massive thank you it's nothing more
than that it's just my way to be thank
you so much to everyone who has
supported me of last few years i
subscribed and come back and it's been
amazing i love you all for sticking
around or for following me and for being
the biggest supportive community i love
our community on this channel you are
all just so supportive and awesome
