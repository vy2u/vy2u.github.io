really well I wanted to quickly film
this video I'm kind of in between trips
just coming back from the Maldives I'm
now packing to go to Dallas so this is
kind of a very impromptu video but I
really wanted to film this for you I was
hoping to film this in the Maldives and
do a bit of a kind of a whole lookbook
what I was wearing but I just didn't
have time unfortunately how stupid is
doing lots of blog post lots of pictures
instead so make sure you have a look at
those in the fro calm very soon but
until then I'm gonna wear through all
the clothes that I wore on the trip
pretty much all of these I got to wear
so I lost with lots of pictures in here

look like
um and of course everything will be
linked down below in the description bar

anyway let's get into the hall
okay first thing actually I didn't get
to wear unfortunately but I will take
this to Dallas with me to wear it there
it's a lovely River Island suede Brown
town skirt your thought this would be
gorgeous for like a little top tucked in
a little cami some cute can lace-up
sandals strappy sandals yeah gorgeous
something actually it would look great
with that is this Topshop with a body in
a navy and I really like this sort of
lattice straps right across the boss
okay holds everything together that
looks really really flattering I don't
actually own anything like this yet and
this trend has been huge to have this
almost lattice effect down the front but
I thought this was quite flattering not
too showy it's not too much boob showing
in this but the ribbed effect the kind
of thick material was quite you've been
lovely tucked into some shorts but it
would look great with that skirt this
dress I'm so in love with I got to wear
this a few times on
so beautiful it's a very light royal
blue with white and gray features all
over it in this pattern it is it's
ruched here and elasticated
around just some cheeks the boss which
means if it fits so beautifully so
flattering I wore this without a bra I
didn't feel like it was coming off we're
gonna I was gonna pop out of it or
anything like that it goes straight down
into a maxi with these beautiful slits
subsea splits as well in the long skirt
it's just extremely flattering it's just
really beautiful at a really
sophisticated dress and that's from
Melissa oh - that's a silky Beach again
all the links will be down below so it's
super easy to find next up is a lovely
blazer I really like the fact that this
was so lightweight and really easy to
throw on
almost got more of a silky satin finish
around the edge of the blazer and it's
just a really beautiful fit to it it's
really used to throw on if you're going
on a warm summer holiday it's not a very
light jacket there's something quite
sophisticated about it this is a good
one to go for that's from Topshop now
this jumpsuit I have so many messages
from my friends who saw this on my
Instagram or like babe you look - really
beautiful and I was like it's really
really nice to hear like a neutral eyes
so many people would really really like
it
it is this one it's from glamorous and
yes it's completely see-through here so
I just wore it I don't have it here but
I just have one of the little black band
out
cotton brows just wore that with it look
perfectly lovely wasn't too soft showy
again it wasn't too overly sexy or
provocative but it just went really
really well with this and it's gorgeous
how it has this beautiful open back it's
lacy all the way down the back so it's
completely soft open up but go down to
long sleeves and cooked around the
neckline and then fast
in the back of the neck but then goes
into these trousers at the bottom so a
lot of moving around yeah I just felt
really pretty in it I felt really lovely
I felt confident I don't feel like how
showing too much skin it was just
extremely easy to wear so I think this
is a big hit and it's not that expensive
either next up is another piece from
Topshop this dress is gorgeous it's so
pretty it's gold and white daisies all
over this black coat out goes right
through the middle almost like a little
belt and then the black goes into the
back with an open see-through cut I
don't work back I've seen it's covered
up above as well I just really love this
kind of contrast of shades the very
pretty theory or gold white with this
very cool black statement sections to it
it's more of a mini dress but I feel
with the high neck you can get away with
it quite nicely it's quite flattering
it's very very pretty and it fits
beautifully
that's Topshop again the next piece is
more designer and I have this sent to me
from Avenue 32 which I love that website
it's a really beautiful website this is
a Phillip Lim top very smooth white
fabric but it has these gorgeous cutout
details to the bottom and this threading
and the tassels it's so beautiful it's
really unique really different and I
wore this with a skirt this skirt is
from ASOS from lost ink and it's a
longer sort of midi skirt with this slit
oil to more of a mini mini--length and
it's also quite high waisted actually so
you can wear is quite high waisted but
it still sort of covers everything to me
a length but then goes down to MIDI so
again this looks great with heels looks
great with some flat sandals or strappy
sandals up your legs it's just a really
great easy
down in peace the neck outfit was from
glamorous again I adored this as soon as
I saw her I thought it was so cute and
usually I don't usually go for red but I
thought something very very pretty about
it it's this little koala set so this is
like a skort so it shorts it look almost
like a little skirt again very easy to
wear very flattering and sweet and then
this is a tiny little top little zip
down the sides to put you in a foot more
and it's just a nice v-neck so again
you're not showing off too much too much
boobs in it I thought that was a really
gorgeous little Somerset felt really
nice than that oh I love these cards
okay so many of you on the Instagram
when you saw this picture said how much
you love these I love them too so these
are a sauce again from the a sauce from
section like beachwear so these are
little shorts I thought these would be
tiny when I tried them but yes ly
elastic ate quite a bit larger beautiful
of shorts and then the top is Bardot
off-the-shoulder elasticated oh it's
just so pretty it covers your midriff so
there's no gap in between the two it
looks so beautiful the colors are
absolutely stunning
I love the and the so affordable I'm
pretty sure the sets about 20 pounds
can't number now why when I go for but I
love that and once we're talking about
that I'll show you what shoes I wore
with their these are from Coach and I
loved this color I've not got any shoes
in this : I thought they were really
pretty and the heel isn't all that high
either really about 4 inches very very
easy to walk they're not that high and
these two strap around top of your
ankles very flattering it's super cute
so I wore it with KUKA watts so quite
like the Pink's with the purple got pair
of shorts from posh I really love Hache
it's such a cute little online store
very easy denim shorts I didn't want
anything too tight do you want anything
that should the back room a bomb and
these were kind of very comfortable
flattering easy to wear
then we just sort of like throw them on
cool and casual kind of shows that's
what I really liked about them and their
coffee at the bottom as well which is
how I prefer my shots to be really gives
you a bit more length so these are a
size six and I am a size six so if you
use their size six knees are soft me
that more kind of baggy comfortable
style they won't be fitted but yeah
those couple of bikinis I got a couple
from triangle
I adore triangle bikinis so I went for
the bright coral Orange if you're gonna
get anything from triangle let's just
say I'm a usually a size XS XS all over
in triangle and I get small bottoms
because the bottoms are quite small
it's how I need specifics it's a scoobo
last name fabric neoprene and also I've
got a bit of a larger bomb I'm not got a
really tiny pop so if you kind of got a
medium to larger bomb size I'd go for
small if you've got a tiny tiny petite
foam I'd maybe go for extra small so I
get small knees and I usually always get
extra small in the bra top so this one
is an extra small for weather if you are
going for a band I'll spare top I'd go
for small pretty much for me I got extra
small in this brass dial and I go for
small in the band ow just gives you a
little bit more room yes so this is a
second bikini so I got this one
and this one comes with pink buttons so
they're mega cute together
and also this is the first time that I
got haven't done the round bomb that
does it's called the cheeky book and I
far prefer actually it's isn't like a
song it's just more like a hipster bomb
style it's just look the more flattering
effect so I really really enjoyed
wearing those together this bra top I
found it in the day I lost it on the
website and couldn't find it tomorrow I
thought maybe it gone and made the free
stocked a few so I'll leave a link down
below so you can try and find it
it's so cute mega cute little pastel
colors animal prints subscribe like a
cheetah print has every print on there
and then I got it with things which is
see I think it's called the sea glow or
sea breeze glow but I thought these
would go cute together and they really
really do except he got that from color
I got this in they just in my usual bra
size my usual bra size fit perfectly and
I got the bottoms in the extra small
another light jacket from hush again
where I got these little denim shots
from this is so cute
it's just very kind of Chanel vibes with
this with the frayed edges along the
jacket and I'll cute little pockets it's
just very easy just to throw on and it
has some little structured shoulders to
this it's quite sweet a very easy nice
little light jacket again I loved
wearing that a swimsuit it's this one
from Jess so what I've got a feeling
that jess is gonna be everywhere soon I
keep hearing loads about it it's
gorgeous houses so I hope you can see it
almost a soft cut work through here it's
all scam mesh and the rest is a little
black fabric but it fit beautifully and
I got this in the UK 8 and it fit
wonderfully on me another thing you can
wear just with shorts as well I'm
wearing almost like a bit the body a
nother swimsuit this one from a sauce
loved this so much it's just such an
easy flattering style if you've got
large boobs this might not be quite for
you so this kind of just fit right over
the top of mine isn't I didn't feel like
I was gonna fall out with it at least
but if you have slightly larger boobs I
would made me think father getting size
up in this or maybe going for something
maybe a little bit different
so that's an easy one for me sauce I
must apologize this is actually now
covered in quite a lot of tan
what I wanted to show you anyway this
over kind of meat white and blue
stripes best thing about it is this cool
rope detailing belt round
yes it's like a rope belt around the
center to pull you in a nice kind of
v-neck style to this nothing too low you
can go out and over a bikini and you can
just about see the bikini but not too
much and it covers your bomb as well
it's a very nice easy one to throw on
when you're at the beach or when you buy
the cool it's just a really lightweight
and really affordable it's gonna mention
a bag that I took with me I took this
one from Coach I really like coaching
the moment doing some really beautiful
little things and the cool thing about
these bags is when you bury them they
come with a charm I like it a secret
shot I'm inside the bag so you kind of
like which are we going to get thought
that was a really really sweet so I've
got some luck charms on there totally
easy to wear just a really pretty orange
red tomato red color I thought it was
really lovely for the summer some more
shooties you still have sand on them but
I thought lo if you might really like
these so from Topshop they're just an
easy sandal lots of straps nothing in
between your toes because I hate so goes
over top of your feet and then goes into
some straps can you tell I'm liking the
straps trend really liking it so you
just go up your ankle little bit not
super high but it's something very easy
to wear I mean these are 40 pound though
I think that they're real leather in the
straps and the last thing when I
mentioned is a pair of sunnies that I
bought at the airport actually from
world duty-free when I was on my way and
I thought I pickle a new pair of glasses
and I picked up the ray-bans in the gold
aviator style with the kind of gradient
going down the lenses and I love them
this is the motto Versailles style
that's a slightly smaller style and this
is the slightly larger one I love the
gold the difference to my usual silver
yeah so are these a hell of a lot
whenever the way holiday and I think you
want to end it there there are a few
more other pieces and if you saw
anything on my Instagram and I've not
