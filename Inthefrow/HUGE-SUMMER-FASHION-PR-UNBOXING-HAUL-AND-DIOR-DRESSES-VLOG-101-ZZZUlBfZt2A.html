what did you get food Jesus on the rack
oh no sorry now
Hey
but now gonna get a taxi over to Mayfair
for the day-long event busy busy day
they run out the lightweight yeah I was
like
hi guys it's me from the future so I've
been putting together the vlog there are
a few different parts of this vlog it's
a lot going on and I've decided that I
want to move some things around in the
vlog but because I've had my hair done
you're gonna be able to note under my
lashes Tim you're gonna be able to
notice and you were like wait why she
got a head on there but then the next
day she's not I'm just going to add the
next clips are from the next day but
they make more sense to go with the
first clips before I go off on a tangent
about clothes later you'll see what I
mean in a minute when you get to it but
I felt like it made more sense to pull
this bit together so that kind of all
stayed as one section so back to the
blog morning guys it's Friday today and
the best on the best days ever I'm going
getting my hair done so me and Alex have
started house hunting so I spent the
entire morning now just looking at
houses let me talk to houses and things
so now I'm like no what else is new here
yeah super exciting now we are Dara's
looking for our own house and I'm sure
I'll be able to bring you along with the
whole process this massive beast has
just formed and it's so tight and so oh
gosh so annoying okay also I have I had
a delivery yesterday the amazing duo
backstage launch literally can't tell
you how excited I am about this lecture
one happies and I really wanted one
thank you is absolutely awesome amazing
so right let's have a little down the
side here let's see what I got okay so
they have sent me a few foundation I
have here I have to warm 1.5 neutral and
two neutral as well just a check I've
got the right shade I love these little
bottles just squeeze the plastic 50 ml
perfect for travel if you want to take
in hand luggage you can they're awesome
there are a couple of brushes in here
I've got this one I know Peter said this
is the most amazing contour brush and it
does look like it is did you look like I
brushes as well oh this is in the
foundation
oh and wow that is dark but I'm a bit
dark me I know that Susie is for
anything then we have the glow palette
oh this is just honestly I'm so excited
about this a contour palette with all
the things I was so desperate about
getting and then we've got the warms the
warm neutral palette and okay I mean
this look how gorgeous is packaging is
so the fact that they're clear Dior's
never had clear packaging so you can't
really ever tell which is in which
palette so Robin I'd like to make it
some breakfast for us so this is
absolutely amazing I'm gonna put on go
for I'm gonna go for what my third
neutral so this is their like face and
body style foundation really really
lightweight buildable coverage that
could just have worked on top and on top
it on top it's not gonna get cakey just
give the most gorgeous do we lightweight
finish to the skin this is also I
thought it would be the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk that mega Markel used for
her wedding day however it was actually
the brand news do your foundation in
case you're wouldn't drink it was used
by her makeup artist and therefore
that's what she was wearing tonight I
mean look at that it's beautiful it's
just this very lightweight veil over the
skin oh it's so nice it's just really
lightweight I realized color on me
actually the neutral is neither warm but
it's not too yellow and it's not too
pink it's probably quite good for me
because sometimes I do feel like I sit
in the middle of the - I can't add a
little bit our consumer right let's go
in with some contour and yes contour
here and more shimmery highlights here
I'm gonna go in with this one here this
nice cool toned
thanks behind this brush it's kind of
very densely packed so it really keeps
the color and the product exactly where
you're laying it with the brush look at
that cool the bank the contour it's so
cool toned perfect like shadow going on
okay beautiful I'm gonna go in with the
globe palette I know that Peter said he
liked to just kind of whiz through all
three pink is perfect for like the
apples of the cheeks and when I go for a
mixture of the white and the champagne
II shades oh my goodness look at that
Wow honestly that looks like liquid
metal on the face that is absolutely
beautiful
whoa honestly that is like liquid metal
the way that goes on I could not use it
myself yet I've had it put on me but you
can't tell in other people's lighting
okay I knew this was gonna be an
absolute gem I knew it I knew it
okay Perez I'm use that on my eyelids I
think it'd be amazing on the eyelids but
I do want to diffuse a little bit of the
warm palette
I'm gonna take this terracotta
terracotta brown it's very warm Brown
which I personally love as my crease
shade well pigment pigment pigment
pigment Wow
dear I feel like in the past say maybe
five years ago they weren't known for
their eyeshadows they I mean especially
for my opinion they were a brand I would
go to for eyeshadows I didn't think the
pigments were good enough in terms of on
the market and I honestly feel that
Peter Phillips has just brought this
fresh wonderful life back into Dior and
now it's it's a brand for makeup artists
and for consumer you know it's got
everything that the professional would
want but it's accessible for consumer
its products at work we've got pigment
they've got everything that you would
want I think I think he's just
absolutely nailed it when I go in with
this mic coppery tone I think with a
beautiful
this is number 21 gonna go onto the lid
was bad and I bet if you had a wet brush
as well as would be even more stunning
these colors work beautifully together
here I feel like the things I could do
with these products if I had lots of
time and I was in an evening look I'm
definitely gonna do that for you soon
I'm just kind of trying to show you what
I'm doing for today with me going out
and I'm gonna go to the champagne e
shade on the number twenty two brush
which is my pen it's all pointer brush
he's gonna sit in a corner there lovely
like champagne very much my counter
thing it's a very quick easy I look I
really love to be honest I love like
deep swish of color over the crease and
then a shimmer so they're just really
really simple and then okay I can't find
my lip brush them something to use this
right here and I'm going to use this
because this is honestly Oh beautiful
they're quite sheer gorgeous light pink
I'm gonna mix actually this one and this
one cuz I remember it now when I had
that done the other day she makes her
too and I just loved what you've done
huge I'm gonna go everywhere fingers
even more even more color feels quite
Barney I saw the beautiful finish there
two lips look at that color and the way
it's just shining I do love it I
absolutely love it these are so good
just so so good yeah I'm just gonna
answer the brows and I'm gonna leave it
at that
I'm gonna make my food really quickly
seriously I'm gonna link I want to link
all the products down below that I've
used for the collection I am absolutely
blown away honestly I feel like
hopefully you can see how it's radiating
out of me how excited am i mean you guys

bring out products I actually I'm like
oh my god these are insane it's just
super exciting for me the brushes the
whole collection the way it looks
styling

think he's just absolutely nailed it
yes I'm going to be super quick get my
brows done and gap looks pretty much
good morning guys today Thursday and I'm
pretty excited to go and get my lashes
refill happy now I've got well you might
not know you might not know I have the
SPS flashes aren't currently from
Nouveau lashes I'm going to see my
favorite Debbie ever she's just the most
amazing person I've managed a booking
with her to get some in Phil's because
I've just been feeling a little bit like
balding like this one especially does
have some lashes in the middle none here
none here anyway yeah I've had this
really strange outbreak here as well
which is I don't know if I slept on
something that's upset it or maybe last
night I went to a Ries meal last night
and maybe I've been too sat with my hat
because I do touch my face a lot movin
start with and some things irritate it I
don't know anyway I'm just going full
moisturize face so today I have to tell
you about oh I love my new jewelry my
ears a bit red except a spin putting
them in aren't they beautiful and I have
the matching ring and obsessed with this
designer I found this design on net
abort a lot last year in the new end
section totally fell in love with the
designs and ever since I've been like a
big fan to shows how for some
independent brands if you can get onto
these huge websites like net and my
Theresa matches if they buy into you and
they believe in you the way you can
spread your audience is huge like I
would never have known about this this
is a designer called Saskia DF I would
never have known about her had it not
been for seeing another port a so since
then I've bought these from a deporte I
got this ring from Louisa the aroma cuz
they also stock her and it's a Potter
didn't do the ring so I have the
matching and I also have the most
amazing dangly earrings that you may
have seen before that little discs yes
that's the first thing ever ball so now
one of my more things I started to show
you because I know a few of you would
probably love these are so pretty this
one's a little larger so it goes here
that's a bit smaller so it fits up in
the top and they're just but not
earrings they are little cuffs because I
don't have those bits
pierced because oh I think I'd pass out
anyway yeah let's go I'm gonna go get
some coffees for me and daddy and headed
to get my lashes done just a quick
little peek at today's very casual
attire practically living like this
if they've some gray jeans from All
Saints my summer run white tee and my
Chanel meals which are pretty much all I
can wear right now because you would not
believe the blisters on the back oh god
I mean the blisters here on the back of
my uncle's this is why I don't wear flat
shoes when I wear flash you through the
back and get horrific blisters that's
why I don't do it whereas if you wear
mules if you wear stilettos that
properly fit around the back of your
ankles a bit higher because of the angle
that you're at you don't get this you
don't get this issue so that's why I
wear heels for normal it's all that why
are you in here anyway so today I can
only really wear mules because you know
one of the only things I have that a
backless so I'm comfortable today we go
okay I just made it to clean look at
Malaysia my amazing Debbie I will leave
by the way I'm wait a second this isn't
really how it's it's gonna kill me
that's better
a lot of you guys always ask me where I
get my gosh you're so lucky that it's
powered by Debbie and Nouveau lashes but
she always does mind like privately
however I will leave her links down
below for describe she's so wonderful
just message her on instagram DM and if
she's in London she's usually in Pearlie
but if she's in London off your imper
Lea looked at Center a message

just had some SPSS done a little thicker
than last time because it's gonna be a
while until I see you again so she's

fluttery right now anyway so McLean
