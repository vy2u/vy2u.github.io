asshole this time for winter and I'm
going to mix it up slightly I figured
that instead of just kind of hauling
everything that I saw that I really
loved
I would instead have a look through for
like winter essential pieces so the
things that I really feel make up my
winter wardrobe so you've got overly
boots you've got big woolly jumpers
you've got gorgeous thick coats you've
got different types of boots and shoes
and then it's a more kind of party
outfits and pieces like that so I went
through with these kind of categories in
mind
picked loads of different things in each
category so I can give you a bit more of
an insight into what I would be wearing
and different types of categories of
products so that's the way we're gonna
go today so there's a lot to get through
here I'm going to get right into this
but in fact make sure you do stick
around though to the end of the video to
find out what today 7 days of Christmas
give aways Christmas prize is going to
be if you don't know a thing yet about
my 7 days of Christmas giveaways have a
look down below I'll leave the
information there as Louis chances to
win make sure you stick around to end
the video to find out what today's
prices right I'm going to get straight
in
first of all with coats cuz I've can got
them right here so the first coat it's
pretty obvious and you may see this
already at another video but it is the
Aviator jacket this is a completely faux
shearling and faux leather style it
almost feels a bit sweaty this is all
faux well it's a really gorgeous style
of AVH jacket I'm not taking off my a-v
a2 jacket yet since I got it it's just
one of those really staple pieces I
pretty much throw it on every single
time I go to shops if I'm going out
quick meetings
it's literature that piece I know will
go with everything sips it require much
thought before I throw it on so that's
why it's really really love it and with
scarves tucked in lovely high neck
jumpers tipped in as well it just looks
really snug and cozy okay totally in
love with this outfit I love it so this
jacket is such a good
aviator I think for winter so me
different ones out there different price
points this is one of the most
affordable price points I found where
it's good enough quality I think it's
just got lots of lovely details on it
it's a little bit shorter than my other
aviator jacket so it feels a little bit
shorter and
more of kind of a little mini jacket
which is quite nice about it but it fits
beautifully it says yeah super cool and
we like it okay I've had my eye on this
piece actually for a little while and
it's sort of a bit of a take on a coat
meets an aviator jacket and it is this
one how gorgeous is this in a beautiful
cream it's more of a creamy ivory sort
of shade it is I think it's completely
faux shearling completely almost feels
like a really thick wall it's really fit
and inside the neckline is his super
cozy creamy collar and it just opens out
into a regular coat jacket it's just a
very thick lovely winter coat and in the
gorgeous cream it's awesome really
stunning peaceful winter I love when we
cream a white winter so I thought this
was just such a good idea for a
different type of coat choice this
jacket and a little bit obsessed with my
gosh look super cute it's so cozy and
cuddly really really like this I think
it's gorgeous in this color in fact I'm
pretty sure this is a couple of sizes
too big
yes I got this in a small because we
know extra smiles but I really really
wanted to show you guys this and my eyes
up for that too small so it's a little
bit big at the moment I do quite like it
that more oversized scale it's super
snug yeah I love this gorgeous and for
the third type of coat is a style coat
that I wear a lot really and it is just
a kind of long length jacket it's with a
dual breasted effect some quite
pointedly pairs just to keep it off
quite structured and somewhat
sophisticated I'm sure and I felt that
in this sort of gray shade a lot of
people would probably love this and get
a lot of wear out this actually it's
just very sophisticated you could just
have it open over a party dress for
Christmas you could wear it with your
work attire it's just one of those kind
of all-around pieces it just works
really really well okay the jacket
actually really kinda nice length I
don't know if I'd put it with these
boots
yes that's so much better with the black
boots and sash a little bit more me I
guess as well it's really cool I like it
okay coax out the way just one sec
created a cup was this beautiful scarf
it's a really pretty blue and peachy
pink coral almost at past allies stuff
it's just really big and chunky really
super large knit it feels lovely
actually it feels very kind of soft
Kashmir II but how pretty - you look
cooler that's it loved this see this or
I was like yeah it's amazing and it's so
super affordable we should probably get
to the point when we can all see this
together all links will be in the
description bar this scarf is a definite
definite keeper I'm in the colors it's
so pastel it's so cozy and soft and I
think I've gotta wear this with so much
and I must admit I do really like it
with my hair because my hair is quite
pastel silver
it looks quite cute and for how
affordable this fall's oh yeah and
definitely keeping it I love this - it's
so outfit I love it okay so obviously
chunky knit sweaters you'll have seen
this one I'm wearing now I love it so
festive I got this in my last video if
you watch that my boyfriend does my Asus
whole video make sure you go and watch
that if you haven't already because I
really love that video and I'm sure I
show me quite a lot of different styles
recently as well but I wanted because a
couple more things I'm a little bit
upset this is a little bit more of a
pricier option if you're open to come a
little bit more on your knitwear but
it's a really gorgeous gray very thick
knit quite chunky just very easy style
again nothing too huge and over
structured on the collar it's just very
simple and easy to wear and it's sort of
things that I would probably wear every
single day I feel like this knit gym
polish it has my name and it's literally
my style for the past one month two
months this kind of knitwear it just
feels wonderful on its really cozy it's
a great style exactly how I like it
quite a big tall neck
lovely kind of oversized fleas does
something very cozy but still looks with
quite stylish you can wear with lots of
different things to kind of scale it up
us out down so yeah I really really like
this I seem to work out if I need
analyze these or not there's a lot more
expensive but things and again I believe
this one was a little bit pricier but
I've been after this sort of thing now
for a little while and it is a sweater
dress so kind of thing I would just
happily wear with some good
over
black boots it's just a very simple self
Christmas but this looks so chic
I really love the look of having a
sweater dress on a lovely dress that
cuts off and then you just got a little
bit skin poking out before your long
opening boots really love that style
overall so I found this one on ASOS and
I thought that the quality look really
lovely and attached that is a beautiful
very thin it it's got a zip detail to
the very back and I think I'll probably
fall in love with this so this dress is
a definite keeper I absolutely love it
I've been looking for something just
like this very simple just simple knit
with a round neck lovely long long
enough sleeves aren't too short and a
good long enough length just to have
that little bit of a slit in between
your boots and your legs it's like that
kind of style for me and be honest I was
wearing black knickers with this has
changed a nudnik is that they wouldn't
show as much so I'd be wary of that I
mean it it feels nothing thick but
opposite screams could be careful I
really really like this one definitely
definitely fit okay so for my kind of
party styles or maybe kind of date night
or going out with the girls I thought
I'd look for some skirt options
something a bit more metallic a bit more
Christmas winter inspired and floaty
pleated skirts have made the biggest
comeback recently and they are huge this
season and I found this one on a sauce
that I thought was a very affordable it
is super affordable option and it's
really lovely metallic it's quite shiny
it's one of those kind of
attention-grabbing kind of pieces but
just with a basic little cami and some
pretty heels it would just be really
cutesy and Christmasy metallic pretty
yeah that was a really cool piece
actually okay so fill them tights get
actually really lovely on a lightweight
almost flicks out at the end so it's an
intentional up everything like that
gives it a little bit more shape is it
kind of billows out in the bottom and it
just fits really nicely it's just so
comfortable if you're wearing this for
night out also you've got a ring for
food you've got room for XF drinks
anything else it just fits really nice
it feels lovely as well so actually a
big thumbs up for this skirt and a
little skirt that quite intrigued me was
this one again
alik I mean look at the way that stopped
shining but it has this floral jacquard
embroidery all over it that just gives
it a little bit more edge bit more fun
bit more playful but also quite
sophisticated and again you could wear
this in some different ways for events
and Christmas occasions where I don't
want to wear long dress I just want to
wear cute look camisole or something
it's kind of embroidered let's throw on
a really pretty skirt yeah part was
absolutely beautiful this skirt is
gorgeous bit of an a-line shape
beautiful way that it capture light
doesn't tight threads burn through it it
fits really beautifully just snug it
goes up fit oversized or too small
unless it feels so comfortable and again
I just paired it with this black
bodysuit just to show what it would look
like like this and yeah I absolutely
love it I think this is a gorgeous piece
perfect for kind of the Christmasy
metallic trends but also a bit of floral
and jacket as well so it kind of hits a
lot of boxes okay so moving into tops
the kind of tops that I'm quite enjoying
that for winter this one on summation
now just because I've mentioned few
times like camis or things to wear with
other kind of more statement pieces a
sauce just do really simple basic bodies
and I saw these thought like I would get
so much easy wear out of these they're
just literally simple black bodies and I
think I like 10 pounds for the two and
it's as something you can throw on unto
anything especially under lacy tops a
very shy and very see-through I have
quite a few of those I always have to
wear a white camisole underneath and
body suits are the best because it means
you'll never get the underneath riding
up and it keeps it really sleek and
really flattering underneath any tops
you wearing above so this is kind of
perfect for wearing on to cream or white
or nude tops and off this is perfect
from the black lace but I just saw a
really good basic piece you can wear
under so many different things okay so
let's put this with fie jacket again
just kind of show it's a full outfit but
it's kind of to start very laid-back
cool chic style this is easy colors gray
white blue black you know super easy so
I show it kind of with this coat again
just to show you a different perspective
and if you watch my boyfriend of me what
you may see one
beautiful shirts Alex got me as I kept
and I haven't stopped wearing it in ICU
labor and feeling this to come anyway I
looked again at the Jack Wales
collection and they had this shirt as
well so it comes in a white and again
it's just quite kind of trendy cool sure
it's a really lovely fabric because the
Matt time to buy shirts and there's that
really kind of workman's fabric
very kind of thin and slapped and super
pressed cotton that just doesn't move
the same way and I really like the more
soft cotton moves a bit like linen that
kind of feel of but I often find a
system do as many of those so I knew
Jack wheels would probably do that and I
was right this is really beautiful it'll
hang nicely and it's a kind of thing you
could just wear with a cute little
jumper and the collars poking out and it
does look really sweet and then cute for
the winter or just tuck into a pair of
jeans throw a big aviator over and it
just looks - no it's really stylish
really fashionable so that absolute love
really really liked the shirt it fits
beautifully I've got my normal size on
the arms and on the length of it as well
but you could quite easily just tuck
this in
- really lovely length really really law
these tops right now okay transit
options as you know I'm bit for Jesus
Tran jeans or leather trousers and I'm
pretty sure I've Pitt knees up before
actually and they're just a pair of
coated black trousers white jeans to
give that more wet look leather look
effect so if you don't want to go for
leather cut-offs it's a lot more
expensive or it may not wear leather
then this is just such a good wear get
around that coated black your denim
jeans super easy and they always seem to
fit really nice and these are really
high waisted really flattering and I
think there will be such a good hit
so these aren't coat jeans they fit
really really well again I've gotten
almost 25 range resize it fit really
nicely just feel to loose everything to
the not super shiny leathery and the not
of a matte jean denim just like to have
in between so it's a little bit more
machine for legs makes them look a
little more trowels
smeet chances so I really like these a
lot
if you do want to go something a little
bit different though a bit of a
different color how beautiful is this
shade I found hope you can see that it's
almost like an Oxford purple a little
bit violet almost but it's definitely an
Oxford raspberry purple and again just a
really lovely high waisted style they
feel like really nice fabric and just to
mix up your outfits a bit just with a
cute white cable net jumper or a white
shirt tucked in it just mixes up the
colours and just adds a little bit more
color for the Christmas you don't always
have to wear black I suppose these jeans
fit like a dream I always get with 25 it
aches awesome you like size 6 and 25
always seem to fit really really well
for me to fit everywhere really I've got
a nice high waisted fit as well so it's
good for tucking things in this color is
actually really lovely hope it shows up
on camera just have one colored red
purple they are they're really lovely
shade yeah really like actually I
finally just a really simple pair of
blue jeans I have completely got rid of
mine now but have well have got rid them
they're altering my wardrobe but for
this season I don't really wear many
ways MIPS or any kind of cuts in them
just cuz I like to keep myself more warm
let's just I'm all sophisticated style I
find if you've kind of got very simple
very subtle kind of jean style so these
are very easy hair again highways fit
and just look quite really I've caught
it to be honest so the blue jeans again
fit perfectly
they are quite a nice height soft mid to
high waisted fit yes really lovely deep
blue petrol blue jeans not more I
consider this fit really really nicely
in the perfect for what I would kind of
want for the winter and finally guys put
into shoes and okay first up obviously
you need a good pair of neat boots I
think well especially if you want to
kind of mix up with the way up you talk
about with skirts or you want to wear
some overly boots with sweater dresses
or any going to dress then it's a good
go-to and I want you to kind of find a
good pair on a sauce and I found this
pair that I thought were actually really
really nice
this pur here in almost a black suede
fabric I'm not sure
swage or not it might not be so really
nice shape a lovely sort of block heel
so we're not too uncomfortable got it to
get you in and this doesn't look all
that big so this should hopefully stay
up back be able to show you that when I
try them up so the boots I think these
are really really great I think for the
fact they're a little bit more
affordable than the ones I've seen
everywhere else they've got a good shape
it's a very feminine flattering shape
they fit nicely around the legs have got
a little bit of texture around here just
to kind of internet adds a little bit of
texture yes
and yeah they feel really comfortable
I've either got to walk a long time in
these because they're not too high I
think they're very good option for an
elf movie I want to give you a bit of an
insight into what I'd wear for party
shoes this season and new tales just go
with absolutely everything in your
wardrobe with jeans with trousers with
skirts with sweater dresses you know
everything it just gives that very fist
case out and that's what I really love
pointed toe as always a lovely killer
heel and it just looks flattering and
feminine and really really sexy in this
shape so this is the kind of thing I am
going to be wearing for Christmas the
shoes are perfect the third pair factor
that kind of very light nude shade let
us fit comfortably but not overly tall
so I can wear these a lot loving shine
patent and yeah that penny my disc is
live quickie but if you want to be a
little bit more glitzy glam then I would
go for something like this these are a
metallic rose gold super-high very very
sexy very feminine I guess something I
would highly recommend wearing again
just with jeans even just makes it look
a little glitzy bit more glamorous very
stylish to be easy so the shoes I have
on them with this because I wanted to
see how it go like two metallics and out
she really liked it and the calluses
work really really nicely and these
shoes so on their own are really great
they've got with a Jimmy Choo vine
they're very high they're lovely and
pointy they're my can't ship like
totally my kind of shoe and they're
really affordable as well these are a
perfect kind of Christmas party hit
definitely and to conclude I have three
pairs of boots to show you because
adding am a little obsessed with boots
this month I
found oh my gosh these are insane I saw
them in a site you know I just have to
try this on just to see if they are
incredible and look at that though it's
almost like a metallic rose gold meets
pewter shade velvet boot I mean that
awesome they look super cool I
definitely try these with some jeans we
need to look awesome over the oxford
jeans without sort of rose gold toning
to them they will look amazing but even
just over black jeans blue jeans I mean
we'll have to have a look at them on but
I just thought they were so cool and so
affordable as well for the style boot so
the boots I think they're so cool I'm
not sure how I feel about them with this
outfit and I do feel like I need like a
size down but it feel really big and not
shot up because it's such a pointy toe
or not I think maybe have the size down
half a size maybe even a full size and
they'll just pay with a pair of black
jeans but I think I actually super cool
this time year I'm really actually like
them it was not sure about long with
this outfit these boots I wanted to pick
up and show you because you reminded me
two different pairs of boots I currently
have from Kurt Geiger these are opposite
a sauce and also this heel reminds me a
little bit of my trussoni boots and the
way it kind of graduate well a little
bit like my geo boots are actually
graduated heel I think is probably
making a comeback again this season but
this is super cool black and it goes
down into an orange
Brown effect really lovely and it's just
a gorgeous smooth black suede style the
boots are so cute they're so comfortable
I love the heel I think these are so
wearable so many people think would
absolutely love these and finally I saw
these really really love them I think
you guys want to how beautiful is this
color that is such a stunning cloud
worthy so much it's got some really cool
tying work around here it sounds like
laced around the edges and down the side
for a little extra detail it's got a
little bit of a westernized feel to it
it's very very made something I would
wear a lot these boots are gorgeous they
fit perfectly they are the perfect kind
of style for me I love the rounded heel
and the colors these are definite
keepers absolutely
of them and that is everything guys what
did you think what was your favorite
