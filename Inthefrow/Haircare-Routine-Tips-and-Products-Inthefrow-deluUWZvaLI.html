overdue video this is going to be my
haircare hair washing hair product
routine video I'm into films for so long
so many of you requested this and I mean
I always get told as well like for the
fact that I've bleached my hair for so
many years it's still in really good
condition how have I done it and I
always say it's due to incredible
products and the products that I use
purple it'll be quite helpful for some
of you especially if your bleached or if
you have colored hair hopefully it might
help you quite a bit I'm going to go
through my hair washing routine my hair
drying routine and my styling so I've
got the biggest amount of products next
to me so I might forget straight into
this now if my hair is in like I said
Auto desperation it needs something big
time safe but on holiday it's very dry
the philip kingsley elasticized their
product is brilliant very very intense
why I usually do is I'll wet my hair a
little bit and then I'll use this and
I'll go through in sections then what
I'll do is I'll tie it up into little
born on took my head with the clip and
I'll leave it for say 10 15 minutes let
this really sink in and then you just do
your normal shampoo conditioning routine
really helps to add so much more
moisture and hydration back into it
plumps out of it it really does do the
trick it's a great product and I like I
say only really uses when I'm desperate
for intense hydration
okay so shampoo and conditioner at the
moment pure ology is my go-to I now get
my hair done at the Georges Northwood
salon which is just off Oxford Street
near Totten Court Road area and they use
pure ology so I've become the biggest
fan of pure ology products possibly ever
I have quite a few actually here to show
you they do a lot of different ranges
depending on your hair type and I'm
lucky enough to a bonel to try a few
other different rages there's a purple
one which I think possibly is my
favorite this is a hydrate range shampoo
and conditioner there is the blue
turquoise which is a strength cure so
this is perfect if you have very damaged
hair or very bleached hair and you need
some ultra hydration back into the hair
this is a good'n
or if your bleached blonde and
this is also great they have sort of an
anti fade complex inside them which
means that your hair isn't going to sort
of lose any of its color and it just I
find it's quite lightweight and
afterwards my head feels really
wonderful after I dried it when I view
these I think potentially this is my
favorite may be followed by this piece
and then followed by the blue but this
is for ultra hydration so that's when my
hair really needs it so I will shampoo
my hair
then comes the toning and if I could
recommend one production off it's this
one I think I mentioned this in my
favourites video it's a L'Oreal
professional gloss protect system silver
it's great it's a bright right purple
color you put it all over the hair if
you are needing more silver in the hair
then I'd leave off in ten minutes or so
it really just helps to pull the blond
brassy tones out of the hair make it
much more silvery and platinum and it is
a miracle worker it's brilliant I pretty
much use this only really wash my hair
twice a week at most really I wash my
hair play every 4 or 5 days that's all I
need to do so this I use quite often I
usually use it every time I wash my hair
for someone that washes a hair everyday
you'd use this maybe twice a week once a
week so after I shampooed and then toned
I'll then go in with a conditioner
lightly put it through not on the roots
only on the ends of my hair and as I'm
sort of washing it out I'll then kind of
take my hands onto my roots and add a
very light amount of the kind of water
down diluted conditioner onto the very
roots let's make sure I've got a little
bit more bounce and not too dry but
mainly the kinoshita goes here then
that's when the masks come into play I
will often put on a mask on my hair
every time I wash it or every second
time I wash it
loving this again it's pure algae this
is a strength cure restorative mask so
it's a little bit like a conditioner
what I general 8 will after I've washed
my hair I kind of squeeze all the water
out of it then I'll get a matte amount a
bit well a good little little handful
this and really lather it onto the ends
of my hair I'll leave it for about 5
minutes whilst I'm washing the rest of
me other alternatives that I would
highly recommend would be the Shu Uemura
color luster very similar it almost
looks like glittery this when you put it
on boys
jerk on the hair and I'd also recommend
the original mineral power based protein
mask
this again is a brilliant brilliant
brand whilst I've also been using this
range which is perfect platinum rather
than using this mask avenues in this
mask which goes they kind of go with
each of different things so this one
goes to this one this one goes to the
other this is the reconstructed pair
mask so I'd say that if you're kind of
looking to buy these I'd buy them as a 3
so if shampoo conditioner on the mask
again brilliant makes my hair feel in a
lightweight but super soft and not
tangled and yeah it brings it back to
life so if you would like some more
recommendations for shampoos and
conditioners that aren't pure ology I'd
highly recommend the catwalk TZ headshot
range the original mineral maintain the
main range
I love these bottles a lot milk bottles
the evade a damage remedy range it's
also incredible as is the Paul Mitchell
super strong range it's if I have this
so long it's already coming off but
those are my top five so Paul Mitchell
evader TG original mineral and Allsop
urology at the top five shampoos and
conditioners I would always recommend I
also need to mention if you last one
with platinum hair and you want to go
more lilac in you want more of a lilac
Sheen this is great for grain silver
this is great for more lilac this is a
fudge clean blonde shampoo violet toning
shampoo this is one hard core toning
product it really does pull the line
look into hair if you want a bit more
lilac tones so thought I'd mention that
now right before I dry my hair I have a
routine that I do with my hair that I've
done probably now for the past 3-4 years
definitely I will add a noose into my
hair one of these will do or this so
these my top three this is the red can
gut volume spray foam this is the
Schumer and put angora volumizing light
foam and this is a BB bomb one bubble
thickening full for mousse so there are
kind of foamy Rufus rub it into my hand
then I rub together I'll throw my hair
upside down and then I'll sort of rub it
all through my hair everywhere not
focusing too much on the roots but
generally around this kind of area here
really kind of running it through like
this just to kind of coat all this
section so that when you then dry it's
got a little bit more body to it and I
find that just really works to give me
this kind of more volumized feel to the
hello it's not too flat so though it's
my top three that I'd recommend Paul
Mitchell also to the phone which is
brilliant then this product that I've
used pullin out past three years I adore
it see TG s factor smoothing lost ERISA
to frizz and tamer and I'll just take
about fifty P peace Tempe peace again
move into my hands I was kind of comb it
through all the sections of my hair
and I just feel that after I dried it it
just makes it so much more smooth takes
away a lot frizz and it to know it's
keep sight more body in it work always I
use the Moroccan oil taking my clipped P
piece onto my hands and then really work
it into the very tips of my hair and
then when all that Sun that's when I dry
it and I dry it upside down as I have
done for the past four years I dry it
completely upside down until it's
entirely dry and it just gives ultra
volume to your hair so literally just
sit on in D bed through your hair upside
down and just dry it without a brush and
diffuse your hair to really kind of you
know help the drying process and whatnot
and this is kind of what I'm left with
this is natural after I have dry days
quite my hair is quite straight but it's
definitely helped by these products you
really work well and then let's not just
tell you about a few styling products
that also recommends so after you kind
of got to this stage if I'm going to be
curling my hair I will always use a HD
curl hold spray it's got heat protectant
in it already but it has some sort of
chemicals in it that when it's reacted
with heat so if you curl in it it'll
just hold the hair a little bit more and
it works wonders for me so this is
brilliant if you want to go for more of
a dry textured look out of some sort of
dry texture into it then the red can
windblown is a dry finishing spray which
is fantastic a lot of Redken products
are brilliant by the way my hair is red
can't color so big fan of red can if I
have had curly hair and I feel the next
day they're a bit limp and need a bit
more life I use the bull and bumble curl
conscious reactivating me
and I just kind of spray it through any
kind of old curls and booths move it and
it just kind of really helps to separate
them again and just give them more
volume this is the red Ken pillow proof
blow-dry to day extender oil absorbing
dry shampoo
this is the best dry shampoo hands-down
I have ever used I find some dry
shampoos really grit my hair and oh I
find that when I put them in and I go to
with my hands through it just soak up
and it just doesn't want to move it's
just cloggy and it smells horrible I
just feel like it laps up any kind of
oils that are still in your hair that
you need to take away but I can still
literally I put it on I'll still be able
to do all this with my hair it just
takes everything away from it when I
first use that I was like oh my god
where's this product in my entire life
so that was a massive insight into my
hair care routine wardrobe products I
guess I really hope that was helpful if
