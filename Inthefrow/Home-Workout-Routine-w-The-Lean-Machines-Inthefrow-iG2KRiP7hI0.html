today by the lovely Lea machines all
right
we've got Leon and John I'm sure you
already know who they are but if not I
will leave their links down below and we
Voss was filmed a feature on their
channel as well so go and check that out
so this is my most requested video ever
the amount of you that asked me to tell
you about how I work out and what is how
can I do to keep fit
not that I've done a lot recently but I
thought I would wrote these two in to
show me some really good home workout
routines and how to do them properly
exactly that so we've hung out with
Victoria a few times now and we've got
an idea of what she does in the gym when
she gets time to meet ya and basically
what we've done is simplified it so she
can do in a hotel rooms when she's on
the move and also you guys can do at
home
but most importantly we're going to be
concentrating on good proper technique
today okay so should we get into it
let's crack on let's do it okay guys
it's about time we start getting bit
ready for a workout so we're gonna do a
quick warmup okay we're gonna leave Vic
to do this from what we want you guys to
do for about five minutes or so he's
just start to raise your heart rate a
little bit use some star jumps used to
run on the spot
just get all your limbs moving and make
it a little bit progressive so big you
ready simple is that simple warm up guys
we're gonna go over exercise number one
it's all about the legs and a little bit
of our squats
yeah and use your sofa at home this is a
perfect depth level so all you got to do
sit yourself up feet slightly wider than
hip-width weight should be mostly in
your heels okay tuck your tummy in adds
nice embrace and essentially you're
going to sit down so you gotta do butts
up your bum just before you hit the sofa
okay so let's slow all the way down or
your pressures in your heels and then
squeeze up to stand up and then tension
in the good so we're going to do this 12
to 15 times you just carry on okay I'm
just going to tell everyone what to do
so the main things that you're looking
for guys is that on the way down and
especially on the way up your knees
don't start to push it
keep them out keep the glutes tight and
also your right yeah chance coming out
so it's down as low as you can go try
not to sit on the sofa
control the movement two to three
seconds down two to three seconds up
tension in the glutes and it's really
good for the quads as well hold on a
second one all right so next time number
two be choice it's almost like half
there and almost like a yoga warrior
pose at the same time we're going to do
some lunges so as you can see nice long
stride face in one way left leg forward
to start with and all we got make sure
is that your feet hip width apart to see
the stop you from falling over
and all of your pressure is going to
through the back of this new drop it
down then go down down down down and
then on the way up you're pushing up
through the front hill simple as that so
you just carry on once again and the
main thing is that your body weight
isn't tipping forward you're keeping all
of your weight down through the hips
pushing up through that front heel it's
really going to activate your glutes a
little bit more so it's going to give
you that nice JLo butt
and the main thing you're sucking your
belly button in so 12 to 15 repetitions
and then switch legs is your foot
sliding back
simple as that so he's giving 12 to 15
and repeat it three times
so next exercise a bit we're gonna start
working the butt a little bit so take a
step down below like this person with
you it's what we call glute bridge race
we need it double legged I'm gonna do it
single negative which is a little bit
harder so feet hip-width apart a little
bit away from your bump
popping hands on the floor what you do
some sweep up and drive your hips up
nice and straight yeah good so you
trying to get up as high as you can
so you're hip so you get straight line
four knees hips and shoulders all the
way at the top it's megadope tougher to
come down this time straighten your
right leg out good right after you go so
now this is single next it's just
working one bum Chiki at times it's much
tougher but it's really really good for
you but you see girls and guys every
Instagram always come in do you squat to
use what if you get a little bit of
weight across your hips and do this it's
gonna build a much better button than
just doing squats is by itself good spot
sides off you go good try and do double
leg birth if that's too easy for you go
to single legs and try and get ten and
fifteen each leg three times all right
time to get the ABS working now this is
a really good one to show how strong
your abs are and it gives you have good
progression to see how strong you are
getting as well so if it's you listen
for me except down your back alright so
we want to do it effectively and we want
to do it well so first I'm going to do
you'll probably notice if you stick your
hand in your back because here you've
got a little bit of a gap between your
lower back on the floor what I want you
to do is to tip your hips back so that
gaps gone so every choice that you have
when I'm out of it there's no room is
there yeah but is lift your knees up for
me be good and straight your legs out
good lovely right if you chest that when
we - it's in helping your lower back and
sprawl so this is really gonna stripping
your lower abs if your lower back on the
floor we know that you're not
questioning not to go that no the moment
so come down with it
good can you hold it there low back from
the market hold it up with that one good
no backs doesn't look bad just about
boob us we want to be like the hopper
ten nine eight seven three pillars out
working four three two and relax good
guys have been that's a really good one
for you out and you can really see how
far you're progressing
okay we want to do a little bit more in
the app so how to do an awesome sit-up
so this can be a little bit different to
how you would normally do it so big I
want you to crush your legs but that you
would in assembly at school big good so
what you're doing is a lot of people
think they've got very strong app so
it's actually hit let's is which don't
you lower legs see they're picking you
up by crossing your legs you'll taken
out of the equation rust if I'm they all
let you do make a little palm like that
in the air good above your shoulders let
the hype good now it's when you try
pulls your shoulders off the floor reach
your hands to the ceiling inside you can
get good like that
okay how much that works your abs
already yeah keep going good so we're
checking the hip that is that the
question we're keeping all the tension
on the app so this is it particularly
gonna work your rectus abdominus love
your six-pack abs and before the last
time we did was a lot more core base and
lower abs as well so you can see just by
changing the way you do your exercises
you can get rid of muscles that you
don't really want to work so much and
isolate more muscles that you really are
trying to work so again try and get as
many reps again if you get 20 of reps
and this is great you can even add a
little bit of weight maybe you had a
plate above you above your chest that's
gonna be awesome - she wants more out so
we're gonna start being a bit of
rotation in get the oblique with a
little bit these are bicycle crunches so
take it back down for me yes I'll do
these ones with you join you right to
that lower back to the floor against
there's no gas pump yeah
lift your knees up take your hands your
temples and you go to your opposite
elbow to the opposite knees over twist
around to the left
straighten up this leg out so the key
word is we're gonna slow them right now
go going to take out three seconds ago
each way really point the toes keep the
chest off the floor and keep going nice
and slow so that's a little bit of
rotation guys means you start to get a
little bit of a blitz involved so these
are the muscles that start to come down
the side here as well you still keeping
your core engaged and you're reconciling
your six-pack abs while you're lifting
up as well keep going you'll be able to
do a few more of these and you will
never get out through the leg raises
earlier keep going big good nice and
slow keep it controlled good how you
doing there all right back to the floor
good luck finding five four three two
one and relax nice one guys bicycle
crunches
so next up this is actually these tiny
little things a little bit of weakness
in the arms everyone kind of struggles
with the upper torso they those muscle
groups do tend to be a little bit weaker
so they do need a little bit more
attention yeah and this one's awesome
because you get to start by sitting on
the sofa we're going to do some tricep
dips so all you got to do is take your
bum to the edge of the sofa and then
straight away roll your shoulders back
lift your chest up then put your hands
right down next to you bar and the main
thing from that point is that your
elbows go backwards they don't go out to
the side anymore all right so face them
to the back and then walk your feet
forward so you can take your bum away
from the sofa and the main thing from
that point guys is that your bum doesn't
lift away anymore so move your chest up
elbows just bend them keep your chest up
down down down as low as you feel
comfortable and then push up and you
carry on going I'm gonna take a break
after this one just to explain some key
points so this is the most simple
version of a tricep dip mainly work in
those bingo wings we call them or the
triceps at the back if it gets a little
bit easy you can straighten the legs out
toes off the floor and heel is planted
so you legs do a little straighter and
you're now gonna be taking some more of
your bodyweight in triceps so carry on
we'll do two or three
push up good so the main thing is that
that chest stays up shoulders stay back
and the elbows are tracking back you can
walk your feet in and carry on with your
body one thing so the main thing with
these ones guys 12 to 15 repetitions 2
to 3 steps and make sure you give
yourself a good 45 seconds to a minute
break between each set
right so next up this one is everybody's
parts nemesis so there's going to be a
few different options if you can
actually do normal press up so as we
previously discussed it yourself into a
press up position on the knees just so I
can go through the basics with everyone
so from the position your hands are
naturally going to go on the shoulders
they just naturally do that so for me I
think if you just take one hand with
either side of the shoulders
that's your set position for your hand
side from there keep your toes down and
just step your knees back a little bit
so you can drop your band down do it no
and now switch your core I'll make sure
you like that doesn't go any further
down so from that position you should be
looking at a straight line from the
shoulder all the way down to the knee
that is a perfect start position and now
from there you just start to lower
yourself down take the elbows out to the
side slightly and that's about the half
range we can stick with that for now you
do another couple of readies so down as
far as you feel comfortable and then
from there squeezing the tummy muscles
and pushing straight back up and this is
this is pretty awesome right so let's
pretend that you couldn't do that and
you failed at the bottom so go all the
way down and now you can't push yourself
back up I'll know you can't do myself
we're all done right so green stuff that
helps you start position option number
one if you can't do that so you step up
as if you can do design and from there
you can automate which knee that you
bring forward so if you just bring your
right knee forward a little bit
it will just spread to wait a little bit
more and then if you drop down to your
normal rep it becomes more of a target
press up for a Superman press up and do
another couple and then switch around as
well switch your knees just to make sure
you keep it nice and even and this is
just a slight variation it will put a
little bit more with the work through
the triceps away from the chest it's
just an option to get you going okay
that was all the different types of
routines that I work into my routine so
