to be all about hair so I thought I
would do some sort of tutorial about how
I like to do my hair when it's curly and
it's Kalei right now because I had a
photo shoot today I could not bring
myself to straighten it and then curl it
getting food just really ruin it so I'm
leaving it like this but I'm just gonna
show you over top of this how I create a
few different curl hairstyles so I'm
going to have kind of a there are two
curls down do and updo a half up half
down and then also a little side bun so
I'm going to show you step-by-step how I
do each of the hopefully you really
enjoy it for this I'm going to be using
the Whitney Marie hair tools it's really
cool kicks it's got five different
stylist in one and they're really cute
because over the pink for larger waves
got a larger barrel and then if you want
Tyler the waves really really small
cylindrical called cone and there's
three on this as well so I'm going to
show you how I use these to create few
different types of curls few different
styles then the really really cool the
heat up really really fast to i2g twenty
degrees to get a really really strong
curl with these the last for ages in
your hair it's a sort of great kit he's
got five yuan so it's just much better
vie for money again the moment you can
also get 15% off this it's like an
introductory price as well so it's
always a nice table at but more cash so
let's get into it
okay so I'm starting off with the very
largest barrel just going to create
larger and soft wave you more natural
ways if you do much smaller say if you
talk on a smaller
it's not so you took just one and you're
up your hair round it's going to create
much much tighter little girls so I'm
going to take a large barrel because I
just want big big curls really start out
by do the back fist I have to just take
let's just get hold of both sides take
them up
okay let's clip them up into a bot wrap
search the bottom a hair to make sure
it's all brushed out I'm just going to
apply a little bit of curl hold
straightaway snake this has he protected
analysis paper to eat protectant spray
for seven different brands he can use
infected spray
- large enough section great nice large
way from this I've got heat up change
degrees and take it down hair
in for kill so you must move it is and
the more it comes out likes really
beautiful sleeker so take it behind the
hair laughs around can you two fingers
as well to make sure the hair wrapped
straight like this
again on inside kind your hair then the
pills will go back quick satisfied this
is a really really hot curler so
this kind of hairstyle as well you can
also keep kale about this if you want to
get really structured and really
cylindrical or you can later once these
are nice and cool these sort of a hot
one night a cool you brush them out and
go out I'll show you guys so I'll just
do the rest of my hair and then I'll
come back to you then all of this size
so far I'm just working on this side
I've sort of separated I mean it's not
as much hair as I'm headed with my
progress is like that so with this
active of partition off the very center
and then do the other side as well
go so far sighs so far to date the top
so it's all done and all nice a curl
like I said it's a perfect for like
maybe prom lock and you want to really
pop tighter really shiny silky killed
like this always much more structured
look that's case just spread a little
bit pepper spray I will stay all right
they look great I think you might do
though now is the second hairstyle it's
celebration at first imagine second
house girl whereby I want to do a low
side walk and again nice like prom or
take some heart up so what I'm going to
do is take all hair back this messy way
so no brushing oh just put it back over
to one side and as you do it scum keep
pushing up with your hair so the reliefs
you don't want or you have this great
Bakula
let's get back Nessus ID at this point
if you wanted to you could literally
just what about women
Thank You sadness that will communicate
pretty or you'll put into porn and the
idea behind doing this will they just
look a lot Messier and sort of prettier
and more natural because it's got curly
waves inside it so so I pulling all the
hair together around to a four shape
fence
here's one of your models where you
could use clips if you want to tape I'm
just going to secure it the flow with a
bubble so can create a little bit little
hairball
and because of all curls and the ways it
deserves so much more texture so much
prettier it's just a really simple
hairdo like I said you can use some boy
pencil or both pin all little sections
in if you want to pull this out make it
thicker out of there quite likely not
thick like this like a little flower
almost but if I wanted to I could really
pull this out make it a lot wider and
put some bobby pins in it that would
work as well but I really like the way
this looks just like this other side but
tonight through doing that my hair is
kind of falling out a little bit anyway
so it's looking a lot more kind of the
way out we're in line a little bit more
wavy a little bit more total
non-structured it's a lot prettier
so next I'm going to show you how I do
my half up half down look best thing to
use is some clear hair ties you can get
these from Claire's accessories or
anywhere like that in the soft hair tie
section and they're just very small
clear little bands and it means that
when you tie your hair up you will see
any elastic bands or ugly Brown lastik
bands II don't really want that it's
clear and it completely sort sees the
look and makes it look a lot more sleek
so what I do for this is I follow my
eyebrow Yeji to my belt bathroom around
here then I pull that hair so I come to
do this with my hair pull it back take
that top section again don't do any
brushing just brush it with your hair
with your fingers keep the curls which
one place
sides a little bit more
vant to grip pull that together
so all you have to do now it's just went
tighter yes you're almost is taken away
in front fringe clip and then yourself
oh oh
the tops are almost falls like tip over
the top
this is really perfect for those days
when July hair beautifully and it's
curled beautifully and the very front of
your head don't quite sit right I get
that so often that's not quite sync the
way I want to pull up the Frog bit it
gets rid of it in this looks really key
that's it all water falls over and in
those curls mix in with the rest of the
curls on look how pretty that looks
and if you want to know how to spray a
little bit of hairspray spray in its
place spray this bit if you wanted to
you could also back home these sections
here so a little bit larger and what I'd
also say would be quite pretty as well
if you wanted to you could use one of
the smaller curls in this set to go
through either these front sections or
through these sections here and maybe
even small and really cute and really
really bouncy if you wanted to what I
really quite like the way it looks like
this just with the bigger curls and the
bigger wand and cooking to looks and the
final look is going to be a fully popper
do so I'm just going to take out this
little
okay so what I'm going to do is rush out
so using the tangle teezer start to
brush three curls I want to it's just
volumize them make them smooth and sleek
if you've been putting he'll do it like
I have will keep their structure but
will go larger a bounce yeah yeah look
how big and pretty a bouncy they are now
so yeah actually if I have you up - oh
I'm just going to take mine up into a
headwind tails it's gonna run my fingers
through the top and see using my fingers
again you have fingers through it don't
use a brush around this is going to ruin
a lot good one - Thomas look a little
bit messy but one place I would say that
Kingdom rush is the very back underneath
you want mouthfeel to go up high like
this take a hair Baba
your ties you like on top yet and time I
don't like doing this three times a
source of it
super easy I'm sure you all know how to
do a high ponytail and then pull that
tight on top through it again just do it
even more children to separate order
you've got short bits in your hair I've
got no shot bin so I can't do this but
if you've got a short bit there like
this one pull them out to the sides
you've got some cute little side bit I
don't have those I have all day length I
pull it up as well might fall for
outside boys I look and as well you
don't really want me to leave you could
tight too heavy
so because pull out
it's not tight yet yet
let's look again if you wanted to you
could recur some vets again with your
hell on falling out if you want to can
also create some smaller little sections
as well which removing it pretty some
bits aren't quite skills you want to be
use a small wand and you can create some
much smaller cute little curls good one
to use bloom of business months well in
the cylinder cone and these are look
gorgeous because it'll be a little bit
thicker at the top and you'll go down to
a tiny little ringlets Kaler at the
bottom so I look really really cute
especially to do these are bits and
bottom as well it's going to lit up to
you how you light your curls to be I
like quite like mine it's not big about
to curls so those aren't like four locks
you've got the sleek wavy down hairstyle
got low side fun and half-up half-down
style and then are up and out of your
face in a high ponytail
we hope this helped you come up with
some ideas of how you can wear your
curls you want to try a different style
the low side but especially is perfect
for date night and that more
sophisticated and sure style especially
with high neck dresses it looks so so
pretty just with everything pool to go
like that and if you've got any short
side sections of hair pull those out
make it even more natural and pretty
like I said I've not really got those
little side pieces so I can't do that
also night found things about and a half
just the big wavy big curls if you
wanted to that showed you alright if
you're in class or in school and you
want to get rid of the front sections of
your fringe put up with a half up half
down or into a high ponytail get
everything out of your face and also if
you did enjoy it please to give me a
like and subscribe if you're new and
I'll see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
