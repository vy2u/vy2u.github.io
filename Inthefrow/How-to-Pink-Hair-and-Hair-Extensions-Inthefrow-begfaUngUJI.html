best mood so I thought I would film I
have been requested so many times to
film a pink hair hair care kind of video
and it's also long overdue that I show
you a bit more about my extensions or
show you how I wear them and how I put
them in so that's what this video is
going to be all about so I'm gonna start
with my hair extensions you might have
seen them in one of my other videos I
mentioned that I just got them and they
are these from cheeky cheeky hair
extensions
absolutely beautiful quality 20 inch
real remy hair and I took them to my son
when I went and got my head I mean
popped them beautifully died for me I
was a bit silly and I didn't film this
video right after I got my hair done so
because my hair naturally saves every
time I wash it and wash it and I've
probably washed it maybe five or six
times since I got it dyed so you can
kind of see the fading on it I also
haven't been washing my hair extensions
the same extent so a very mild in this
video my hair extensions are not the
right color for my hair right now so I'm
going to have to wait until I get my
hair dyed fade a couple of times until I
can pop to wear these again and I
thought honestly mine that because I
don't wear extensions all the time I
wear them off kind of special occasions
or I'm gonna big night hour and I really
want to boot for my hair a bit and if I
really do need to use them but I'll just
wash them again and some hair care tips
so with extensions it's better not to
wash them that often because obviously
they're not attached to your scalp not
getting the natural oils into them so if
you're constantly washing and constantly
washing it's going to dry them out and
make an awful quality and I've just wash
these walnuts and they're still really
really beautiful but that's because I
use some of my amazing conditioners on
them just to keep them really really
really nice so so I just sort of show
you how I apply these you actually get
so many pieces all right I've had
extensions before I didn't get this many
pieces before but all of the clips
already sewn infusive super quick so
three threes there is four two twos
and to once so what I do is also make
sure the nicely brushed but try not to
ever brush them when the wets are else
you'll just stretch the hairs out and
just totally ruin them half only ears
draw a line across the back hair I'm
just gonna take a three
they'll go just above my ears then I'll
try the four
I actually love the way the colors mix
how pretty it's like dark my synapses my
lipstick which by the way is one crime
poison berry about an inch above I've
got the centimeters above that going to
take
put both threes around each side and
hopefully it will fit
if it's all about you do for yourself
how much you think it looks real or fake
I also don't want to look really really
fake but this side I think looks okay I
could probably add another clip maybe
into this you got a one-sided one yeah
so but on the other side I have my part
income notes I've got even more hair so
go a bit high with this now and get to
don't want it too far forward what do
you feel that kind of central as well if
you find it hard to attach your hair
extensions and just back comb the area P
about to expand your extensions onto
your back if you've got really thin hair
and you find it really hard to attach
the extensions because they feel like
falling out just back comb the area so
then you've got a little bit of kind of
gripped and texture for it to cling to
so with the Night Court another do
gotta be careful I'm going too far
forward because you don't want your
clips to show there's nothing worse than
when people show the clips now if I've
actually used all of my clips apart from
the wall so I could put it in I guess I
could put it in a bit higher
why not and voila big volume s yeah and
I might just this is all the same color
it would play all blend to really really
well look much longer to fill it all out
a bit but because mine's very two-tone
you can even leave it like this or what
I think would look really nice gonna be
really lovely side plaques it'll mix all
shades
and then I just got streaks going
through pale and dark purple
just a
that we have one of these little plastic
see-through your last sticks so it can't
be seen get these from Claire's
accessories for about two pound and the
best thing to happen to flats ha ha
how cute okay so first of all so many
people ask me how do I get my hair this
color first of all I don't have it
bottled I'd I hope it died in a cellar I
go to a salon they bleach my hair I am
naturally a I was a blonde I haven't
seen my actual hair since I was by 11
because I've dyed it for that long I
bleach it that long however it's
probably now like a mousy blonde brown
so more for really dark blonde well
because I am a dark blonde it means that
when I die and bleach my hair I don't
need a really high bleach I got into
over bleach it I don't need to
constantly bleach it every two weeks
because it's coming out with darker
roots so that's the reason why I get
away bleaching it much less and it means
that my hair isn't damaged a lot of
people dark hair off so you love to go
these bright colors unfortunately it
does damage their hair more because you
have to keep bleaching it and that is
such a shame well there are ways you can
kind of look after your hair more so I
thought I show you just a few of those
products just to see if you could switch
up some of your own and if you have
colored hair you find its breaking and
it's just not looking as healthy as it
could be so this is what I use
first of all let's say it's really
important not to scrimp on what
conditioner and shampoo you use I use
pas Mitchell this is a super strong
daily conditioner and daily shampoo but
there are so many in the Paul Mitchell
range some of the repairing smurflings
for colored hair things like that but I
just found this range is just the most
wonderful product for the hair it's just
loves a beautiful a it complete the
cleans a hair till the cleans out and
then the conditioner it just makes a
hair so silky smooth it's amazing but
then after I've done that I will then
finish off with some of the
she s factor serious conditioner this
stuff smells like strawberries mixed
with mints like strawberry mint
oh it's my face thanks strawberries mix
with mints it's the most intense
beautiful smell but it's the best
conditioner see I've had this now so
long and it's not even halfway down I
think it's not be about thirty pound to
buy but it was the best investment I've
ever made my hair ever
it's where after I've left the condition
and moved for a minute so I washed it
off I put this on the ends I really coat
the ends in them a little bit through
the rest of my hair as well just to kind
of get that a bit more softness leave it
on for about five minutes while I wash
and rest myself and then I wash it off
after my hair just feels so light so
clean fresh and so super silky soft so
this is one of the best things you could
ever buy for her after you've washed it
and you're also comes dry and gets a few
other products that can help you keep it
nice and clean and fresh and soft first
of all a really good he protects spray
don't dry your hair or I'm styling your
hair without using heat protectant spray
so sister DHT he protects spray there
are a lot out there on the market I just
generally should really trust a high-end
hair brands that's just me so I use the
DHT you are on I just puts it over the
ends especially a little bit all the
rest of my hair and then I'll dry upside
down to give it some volume I just found
this works really really well for me
that's about 11 pounds so after I've
sprayed that onto my hair I'll then add
the GHD total volume foam
I've sat about three pumps into my hand
turn my hair upside down brush it
through your hair with your hands kind
of run the roots out a little bit
further out from the root but still in
the kind of air this area if your head
and just to give it that boost when it's
dried and I find that's fantastic just
dry it out then I'll add this which is
kind of part of the t-shi conditioner
range I showed before they smells even
better this is just strawberries you
take it smells like strawberries and
cream there's ones like mint and
strawberry smells like those campy no
sweets strong pretty ones
it's absolutely amazing I'll just use
maybe about 20 piece
and I well this is called the smoothing
moisturizer system see Fred's entertain
your hair so I just run it through in
strong's on my hair's wet before I wash
it and it's really smooth down any kind
of areas that might Frizzle whatever
so after I dryer it's not frizzy it's
just smooth and sleek I'm really really
nice
they pull a the piece de resistance of
this entire thing if the Moroccan oil
this is the largest bottle it's about 35
pounds yes I know it's extremely pricey
for hair oil however it is one of the
best things ever for the hair and I add
probably about 10 P to 50 P piece of
this and again really when it's with
ends and I smack seem like I'm putting a
lot of products on my hands when I dry
it but it doesn't weigh my hair down it
means I've got volume I've got
smoothness and it's he protected and
then it's finally got some it's a bit
for beef stew very very ends to make
sure they're super but I'm looking at
this because that's not my hair and I
look to the actual ends of my hair and
it just makes it soft it just sort of
almost like it's repairing the ends and
just give them some more life because
also the ends of bleached hair gets so
dry it's it's give them that life back
so that is everything that I use for all
I'm going back to my hairdressers
so they bleach it through and so it's
all one color and then they go in with a
toner same way that if you have silver
or platinum hair they're going to toner
and they take away the brassy tones from
the bleach bleach mix head's horrible
yellow gold it pulls that out if your
hair makes it flatten themselves out now
I'm not trying to short my head if the
dose but I think she has a little bit of
dye into the toner and it pulls it out
into like a purple let's use the purple
I go for a scuff pick in the moment it's
purple and that's it and it's not out of
a bottle though I'm really sorry the
matter people ask me what color do you
use and I always feel all folks I can't
tell them but it is to sound died a few
of the tips I suppose if you've dyed
your hair pink
try and use colder water when you're
washing your hair but the warmer water
is while you're washing your hair the
more it's going to pull out : pop color
the colder it is it's not going to open
up the pores
of your hair strands as much it's not
gonna let as much color out so colder
helps a lot so would you just heat all
of your hair dry keep and I start slow
some eutteum heat and that help your
hair a lot more the ring started so
probably better wrap this video up now
but I really hope that's helped some of
you and thank you so much everyone for
this amazing complements always keeping
our hair it's so so nice to hear how
many people like the color and the
condition and things like that so thank
you so much but I really hope that this
kind of helps you if you've got colored
hair and you want to look after a little
bit better and improve the condition of
it really hope this has helped so as
