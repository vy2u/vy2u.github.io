different video today this is quite
exciting actually I have been invited by
l'oréal to take part in their seven
days seven ways hairstyle challenge with
the idea being that I creates an
everyday hairstyle that's perfect for
the summer and hopefully will give you a
bit of inspiration of some kind of ways
to wear your hair for the summer it's a
pre excite challenge that's been going
through a number of awesome vloggers and
youtubers I have been nominated by the
lovely Polly to create another hairstyle
another everyday half step today I'm
going to create a very sleek and
straight look yeah and I will get going
let's take my hair it's gonna give my
hair a brush if you're going to be
straightening your hair you need to make
sure that your hair is really free of
nuts
smooth and it's not going to nag on your
hair straight then you want to work out
where you want to have your party I
always go for a deep side parting see
now that's how you to learn my hair very
own natural today
we're going for a new look now what I
you to do is I start with the back so I
or generally section off a hair above
ears
Toliver up clip into a bun shape
better brush now you've got to make sure
as well use really good heat protectant
you don't want to be ruining your hair
and burning off the ends so make sure to
use remove the heat protectant spray
there's lows around L'Oreal do a
fantastic one in the spray bottle so
yeah so make sure to spritz your hair
some hair protectant get that good brush
through you don't want your hair to be
wet if it's able to wear it you can
finish at the hair and that's not what
we want no taking your parrot
straightness whatever you have I'm sure
y'all know how to straighten hair so
just glide over the hair in it you don't
want it to you don't wanna leave it on
the hair either for that long you just
you'll find that most straightness
nowadays are so good that you'll only
need to have it on your hair for that
seconds the thing that's quite good to
do is literally kind of you see brush
knee straight it's and different hands a
great brush use your straightener it's
been so long since I've straightened my
hair it's kinda nice it's look really
sleek and smooth
I might go with and it depends how much
hair you've got um smaller sections of
hair loss of straighten a lot lot better
than larger sections but that will take
long Messick it's entirely up to you
read it and now I've got a lot of hair
on this side so I will cut this in half
and just tie up this top section
when it comes to the back you get your
brush this lot of comb from the crown
backwards take that piece of hair
straight in I'm going to use the Loreal
Elnett satin spray hairspray now this is
in so sleek which will be perfect for
creating a much more sleek look I've
been using all that hairspray now for
yes since I can remember this was like
the hairspray of choice it's just such a
kind of well-known will famous products
I'm sure everyone it's had a bottle of
Elmer in their life it always reminds me
of when I was around the age of eight
and they used to do dance shows and
every mother at the dance sure would
have a bottle of Elnett hairspray and
our hair would just be so stuck in place
perfectly every single hair in place
that smells really reminds me of like
really good times and a lot of my youth
really using these hair sprays I'm going
to use it spraying it downwards onto the
hair super smooth and sleek
then for back clean again onto brush and
brush that crown section backwards so
it's perfectly in place and give that
good say that's what I usually do
because I'm not one for really annoying
tires just take the hair whip spritz
just give it a little bit body if you
wanted to
super sleek lift up your fringe good
spammy hold it place all the things I
would also recommend this hairstyle
would be a bandanna and just literally
wrapping any bundle you have just be
super cute for if you're on holiday
flappy cap can't go wrong in summer and
blow my face
nice big floppy hat of course
just keep it super strength and it seems
human change the style this enough of it
just brush all out and the hairspray
Luka was my partner challenge how to do
things I did it's not stylized and go
for come you just a lay there at the
time too but for this kind of date
nights nights summer going up with
friends or just do something a bit
different I think's gonna look a bit
more sleek and put together a straight
hair look a good bit of hairspray to
keep it in place just no-brainer easy to
do and just look so simple and pretty I
now have the pleasure of handing over
this challenge to the beautiful Sammy
