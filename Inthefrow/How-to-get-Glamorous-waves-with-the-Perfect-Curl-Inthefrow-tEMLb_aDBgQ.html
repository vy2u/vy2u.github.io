fun to filming the Tony guy out for us
tutorial that so I would do another
tutorial this time with another hair to
of I have which is the fabulous perfect
curl I went to my salad recently I got
my hair colored and the enjoy saw says
would you like hair styled before you
leave but she said she just got one of
these do I want to try out
ok let's go again so I go and the curls
were incredible and no matter how many
times I brushed out of skills they did
not believe my hair about 5 days except
just hadn't believed you sort of super
to a city to wash it that soon so for
five days I had these incredible massive
bouncy curls so after that I was like I
need to get my hands on one of these
quite a new addition to the babblers
range and it is kind of got so much hype
about at the moment cuz it's just so
different to every other styling tool
obviously straighteners and hair wands
totally different then it's this kind of
large barrel and you place your hair
into it it sucks it through and twists
it around to this this little barrel
inside heats it through and then you
drop it out it's a perfect curl hence
the title perfect curl thing to think
about is there are two of these on
market apparently one of which is the
salon style Edition one which has all of
these alternative settings although
there is an ordinary one which is
slightly cheaper thing it's about thirty
pounds you put I think it's 140 pound
and it doesn't come with these extra
settings it just comes with an ordinary
curl setting one heat setting I think
something like that is kind of a very
lower specification
tool whereas this is a salon Edition
which is a 170 pounds I think from look
fantastic you can get it and a few other
places and it's got three different
selections to choose from first one is
obviously the power setting but it comes
in three different sets
things one being for a lower heat
secondly high heat third being even high
heat sauce we've got we've got finer
hair you'd only need a small heat which
apparently is 190 degrees according to
this booklet 210 degrees the second 1/4
of more textures hair normal hair and
therefore more thick and wavy hair you
want to go for something bit more heat
so the top one is tuned to 30 degrees
which is immense
this one is time settings if you've got
0 8 10 12 so that's kind of 8 seconds 10
seconds 12 seconds eight seconds is
obviously gonna be on your hair for less
time therefore it's gonna be looser
waves the higher setting of 12 seconds
office is going to much tighter a way so
again you can choose view on a more
loose ways of you want tighter tighter
curls the last setting is scale
direction so it got right left and auto
it all says it here you have the saver
and our LNA right obviously is for the
right hand side your hair see let's go
that way left us for that way and then
the auto on will randomize which way it
goes therefore if you want to create a
really big bouncy lock then you can just
saw keep still keep twisting around so
it got alternate curls they'll push
against each other in volume eyes even
more let's give it a go this is my first
time using this with you
so hopefully this will go okay I'm gonna
go for the first heat setting I'm gonna
put it on eight seconds
just because I want a really light curl
and I'm going to start on the right side
so I've got I'm right I'm going to start
by sectioning starting again about an
inch off the ears I'm gonna give my hair
and go brush I forget I'm going to use
my trusty GHD style kale hole spray
which is a heat protectant and an
incredible curl holder all in one
okay the idea with this is it on one
side it's got the loop on the other side
it doesn't that loop always has to be
towards your head or else your hair
isn't going to sucking right Oh
so let's go okay so for longer hair
meant to take smaller sections clue the
wise the tool can get clocked go to make
sure they're extremely smooth okay so
this goes towards the head need to put
it on to the hair where you want kill to
start so from down this side I'm going
to put it around here three beeps now
that is a curl okay so with the eight
seconds setting it's three beeps for the
ten seconds setting is four beeps and
the twelve it's five beeps I think you
just gotta wait until like that clicks
and then you can let it all out
let's keep going if you're looking for
something that's quite quick this bully
from the tool for you because this
probably takes about the same time as it
would be for straightness or a cola so
if it's speed you looking for then
perhaps this isn't the one you want to
go for but if you're looking for
incredible curls that you might take
five minutes more than usual
straightener or curler then I'm just
looking pretty good
to lose realized I'm actually using the
right fitting on our side let's rectify
that issue again though if you're doing
the front of your hair
it's left to right back that's fine but
I mean the rest of hair you could just
switch it on to the auto tool so that
you so the curls do go back and forward
back and forward it's completely up to
you okay so three beeps an Adobe
lovely
okay baby the very bottom leg done I
don't usually have a clip but I lost it
to be more adventurous with how much ham
taking larger sections to take the large
away
again Modi's careful a bit lower down to
the nice - to the roots whilst the top
of my head
so that is what happens when you first
kill them three I mean as you can see
these ones are dropping out a bit more
now than these ones she's quite nice
so again Tangle Teezer chose Tangle
Teezer and give them a good rush out
and there we go I'll brush down quite a
glamour kind of look in the way it's
come to the front that kind of reelect
Great Gatsby style glamorous waves I
love it and that is a perfect girl I
would actually highly recommend this
it's perfect for those struggle with
hair ones or with straighteners super
easy to use and we just take quite a bit
of time because I've got to take quite
smaller pieces than you might do with
Paris trainers however it makes sure
that all the curls are really uniform
and the very ends of the hair are also
curled obviously with straighteners or
sometimes curling wand you can't quite
get the very ends completely killed with
the rest of the hair because you're
either holding it or it's off the edge
of the straightener whereas with this
it's completely uniform all the way
around and every bit of hair is getting
the same amount of heat so you're not
just applying a little bit of heat the
beginning or not enough to the end I
kind of think so obviously as well it's
better for your hair because you're not
applying too much heat to one section
and not as much when they're in fact
it's got these three settings you can
change the heat change the time to use
directional to curl it's quite a novel
product you know the product really has
that kind of the ability to change so
many settings on it so that is really
really cool and it's definitely
something I'm gonna be using a lot now
think I mean obviously takes a little
bit longer than Paris straightens doors
or a hair wand it depends how fast you
are with a hair Stalin tools but it's
still create Sue's incredible curls so
if you've got a little bit more time say
ten minutes long live in the morning to
do it or for now it's definitely
something out highly recommend
so yeah really hope you enjoy this video
I hope that somewhat useful so I'll show
you how what it works how to use it and
maybe give you both matter if you want
to get it me for Christmas or get it for
someone else the president's baby she
feeling generous see I really hope you
enjoyed it please like the video if you
