video it has been so long since I did a
haul I've been doing quite a few
different look books and those sorts of
videos but it's been a while since I did
a haul and kinda showed you what I've
been picking up the last month or so or
for a while actually it's been over
months it's my last haul so I've got
lots of dresses this time because I've
got some different items that I've
picked up I thought I'd kind of split it
and do dresses in one hole and then tops
and shorts and trousers in another hole
so this is going to be all dresses lots
of different summery dresses and also
things you can wear leaning to autumn
and also late holidays also as always
I'll be showing you the products as I'm
wearing them and the way I've styled
them with a few different things so I
don't mention the products they're
styled with have a look in the
description box
everything will be linked so if you
liked certain piece and I didn't
actually mention where it's from then
you're fine where it's from just below
let's get started so the first thing I'm
going to show you is this dress this is
from our Tilley pop pop I absolute
dollars dress it is going to be the
perfect work dress really it's a great
length with it being midi so it's not
too high up and it can ride up a little
bit if you walk and get it well because
it's so long you're not going to be
worrying about it coming all the way
over to your stomach so it's it's all
good and it's just most lovely lasting
fabric it kinda reminds me of the fabric
that Black Milk use that really lasts a
knee lovely luxe fabric so it's really
really amazing quality actually I'm
going to get a couple more dresses from
this run because I actually love this
much that is reducible moment to about
80 pounds from about 140 next up we have
another recent favorite actually I
should mention this is going to be
dresses placing some jumpsuits ha
actually not as dresses jumpsuits and
say seats because I feel like three very
intertwined you were locked dresses and
job takes place suits as I'm over the
day and you can also wear as evening
things so that's what I'm going to do
it's a suit I've been the thing is this
one from red label really cute I don't
worry about native you actually I really
like this on it's got a little
drawstring in the middle to pull it in
make it nice and simple in the waist not
too short so the perfect length rhythm
Shore area and it's a bum down style so
it just clasp around you and it's really
mini secure that's not going to come
down so really lovely fabric and just a
super easy thing to throw on in the day
or on a holiday or with things like I've
worn it with and I shirt and some boots
really lovely and that is around around
20 pounds next up is a recent fave
actually and this is from Wonderland
clothing and it's from a brand called
reverse this is so lovely
now excuse the fact it needs an iron
badly the fabric does crease quite
considerably but it's so nice so it
comes up at the back in trousers which
then zips up at the back so your back is
entirely exposed and
front you've got these two sections ago
up in a halter neck there's cover you
over it's really really flattering and
I'm so excited I wear this on my holiday
next week yeah really really love that
it's really lovely I think that is
around 60 pounds something is more
casual now is this good if I had the
right way around this vest dress from a
brand called you're breaking and it's
kind of an old-school vest dress style I
used to wear these so often years ago
and whether been on my life again so I
wore this over P knee wore it with my
new triangle bikini and also you can see
the colors coming through back quite
light that you could see those kind of
neon colors popping through beneath the
white and but it's just really simple
and easy.if holiday or throw a knife
who's going to shops little pair of flat
shoes and a little tiny jacket the top
it's just really sweet so that I think
is around $30 next up is it Lacey this
is from ins in the style in the style
and it's a cute little place it again in
a very sheer
I feel looks like a viscose fabric
cinched in at the waist to pull you in
but it's also got this wrap over effect
at the front it wraps over you very
front and I wore this without a bra
because I thought it looked quite cute
something quite sexy about it because
you've not got anything between these
Driscoll for you over in the center as
you can see and yeah really liked it a
cap sleeves lovely fabric love it for a
holiday or a lovely evening out on a
date night would be perfect and I think
this is around 25 pounds gained all
links are below so forget any of these
price is wrong I'm really sorry but just
go along and have a look next up we have
a cute little dress from misguided how
pretty these colors so nice little
pastel ice cream dream dress band ow
again I used to be upset about no
dresses and I haven't worn for a while
actually but
I've picked up quite a few recently and
I'm really getting back into them game
that's so easy to wear super wearable
really comfortable I mean also the worry
with one doubts that you always
constantly pulling one couple them up
but this didn't seem too bad at all it
seemed to fit really quite nicely it's
not too short I've had much shorter
dresses from misguided yeah again date
night dress or a holiday evening out
dress perfect
I think that's around 25 it'll play suit
we've got from Fira and Lucy the little
black completely black play suit it's
got a lace trim to the shorts and it's
also got a nice trim just around the
Worcester area as well
it's nice little bit of details it's not
completely black and playing a little
bit detail to go with it
cinch it in the waist again you look
beautiful a little chunk belt perhaps or
a neon belt some neon shoes and yeah
really cute and I think that again is
around 25 pounds one of my faves
actually if this sort of dresses his
variety Brown cog Nana Judy and from the
front it looks kind of simple plain then
on the back it's got the print that
carries on from the sleeves you've got
it really pretty it's almost like a
stained-glass window
Kaidu scope effect print beautiful
almost silky satiny fabric really really
nice so it's cut through the back and
that's got zip
to get you in as well it's quite short
to refer for dress again at date and
address or in the day time on holiday
easily get away with it or you can wear
it over / shots if you wanted to and
took in wear it more as a top for shirt
perfect and I think that might be a doll
it's actually I think that's around $30
next up I have this dress from silly
clothing and Wallace recently to summer
in the city and got quite a lot of
compliments about it it's really pretty
it's got a cut through the middle so
you've got a little bit split off your
stomach showing and it's got a zip on
the back to get you into it
cute little tiny fleas to it as well I
don't know something about this that I
really really really love print is
really different and really unique and
again that's from steli an Australian
company and I think you're looking at
around $40 of that and we have another
little Bang Tao a few little brown
dowels in this hole this is from Lipsy
nice ruching effect to the waist that's
covered over by this cutout embellished
section down the right-hand side and
that goes across the Baathist as well
really pretty little sweetheart neckline
sit to the back so you can get into it
it's not overly short actually it quite
like the length of this it's just really
really flattering on really really
recommend the lipstick collection this
is from the Michelle Keegan collection
highly recommend that collection
actually because I'm so many love little
pieces of it this I think is around a
60-pound and also I got this dress I'm
in love with this actually this is from
a brown coal this is a love song and
they often do these very vibrant and
characterful prints so this is the yen
and dollar dress it has these cutouts to
the shoulders Privett detailing high net
could zip just as though shorts it up
the back of the neck and then you've got
long sleeves and you've also got the
cutouts in the side too extremely
flattering with the long sleeves not
overly short and I find it really
comfortable I can put this on I mean I
liked it off the hanger but as soon as I
put on us like this fits like a dream
I'm so fitting and flattering it's
really lovely
so that is around I think that's around
fifty dollars actually and lastly I have
this little number from this is from a
brand called reverse but I got it from
Wonderland clothing and this is really
really sweet it is a almost a shift on
sheer fabric with floral pattern in
blues and pinks and greens lovely lace
insert at the front kind of thing that
perhaps you couldn't wear a bra with I
didn't wear it with a brass sequencing
center but not too short I mean it's
quite short play suit I paddled on the
placeit's and their spots really not
quite nice in fact that your arms are
covered means it's a little bit more
sophisticated so that's really really
sweet and I think that's probably around
30 pounds and last but not least is this
dress now this is from a brand College
aidid London and I work with Jada a
while ago and I really loved their
prints this is part of their new
collection which is really vibrant again
super lovely that really quite thick in
last ancient past a material and cool
long sleeves high soft neck as knows you
pretty things you don't need once it's
come like a jump a dress and sure you
haven't comes ever comes down to neck
here so not too short perfect to the day
dress and look around holidays a bit
thicker so it work perfectly for the
autumn months
and yeah really really like basic remote
and pair of leggings if you want to show
off your legs and yeah really really
light Joe you don't think this is around
fifty pounds okay so hopefully that was
everything I really hope you enjoyed
that let me know if you like this kind
of routine sort of show you everything
and also show you me wearing them I mean
which way to preferred in a few
different ways now if you like this way
