fashion and style haul I filmed a boot
holiday which may have already seen such
a soft second part I've got so many new
products I thought I'd show them into
parts I've got beautiful and then today
I'm doing the fashion haul so if you
want to see the beauty haul I will link
that below so the lot to show you so
we'll get going
I'm going to start with a sauce it's
when my favorite brands and it just
always stock things are just really
wearable and easy to wear and and this
is something I picked up
it is a white like waffle style textured
top really lovely kind of thick your
last any fabric long sleeves which I
kind of roll up and it's just so
wearable there's some like leather pants
even with jeans over the top a nice big
chunky necklace and I've been wearing
this so much so that was like 20 pounds
also from a sauce I haven't even taken
the tag off this yet it's a little mint
green camisole extremely wearable I have
a number of these little camis now that
just go so many put things up I wear
this for the Pearl other charles's and
pair of jeans maybe tucked into a skirt
or and a long pencil skirt for night out
perhaps again that was that's quite
cheap think that was like 12 pound but
super wearable also from a sauce I got
this scope which I absolutely love
pencil skirt and it's got soft gold zips
down both sides and just get into it you
undo the ties it put it on zip it back
up again and it's just the perfect fit
for me exactly what I wanted to stop for
work again with kind of a camisole
tucked in or a long sleeved body a
long-sleeve tee and extremely wearable
and I absolutely love that I think that
was only about 16 pounds maybe 20 pounds
but I would get so much wear out of it a
love that makes us I also bought these
shoes so pretty like these because
running around clothes big chunky buckle
I'm nice off big tall link from the
cooked outside so it's super soft sexy
get little bit toe cleavage and and
they're so beautiful I think these are
45 I'm so wearable with jeans with
trousers just give them that really
classy a sexy look and I love these also
fur makes us I got this I mean a cute
little crop jumper again it's kind of
like a waffle knit in the center and
which goes into like a cotton and sleeve
that has been embellished and sewn this
kind of really cute pattern a silvery
gold thread so it really sort of stands
out against the cotton and this is just
so so cubed and again so wearable cuz
it's white you went with so many
different things if you own something
quite plain then they kind of put a
pattern on the side kind of brighten it
up and give it a bit of bit of fun so
Sam and I think about 20 pounds then a
week ago I modeled for bouquet with a
couple of the bloggers and for their own
it campaign and they let's keep the
things that we modeled which is amazing
so one of the things I modeled for
6-quart black kind of PE plenary scott
and around at least at the front and
it's a sort of show UPS at the back it's
got zip up the side it's really on trend
piece for season perfect with a cami
like the mint green cami I've got our
babies my black Connie and or a
long-sleeved top with some tights for my
winter and that I think is 20 pounds
also from boohoo I model to this really
cute little cami again I really like
camisoles at the moment that are so easy
to wear and you just put jumper at the
top or a jacket its monochrome and this
kind of track check print and v-neck
kind of neckline into kind of a high
almost like race about style the back
extremely wearable sort of floating nice
fabric and I'm sure we get the loads of
wear out of this for the season I
thought I'd mention these as well
because are something that I have been
wearing pretty much everyday these are
from the boohoo from the shoot and all
black although I do have things that say
ones with white souls as well and but
there are black and in soften that nice
soft suede II really nice of light
velvet suede fabric much what it is but
again so wearable with most pretty much
everything you could possibly wear
skorts
shorts trousers G
means everything so I think there are 25
pounds then from karma clothing I got
this really adorable little pair of
can't play suit dungarees again just
with a pair of thick tights community
honest off shorts with pair of nice
thick tights big chunky boots a
long-sleeve tee like black tee
underneath and a jacket this will look
so adorable it's like this the back
putting this up and I think this was 20
pounds 20 to 25 pounds again I put our
links below and I'll call the price as
well if not to have a look but I think I
can probably get quite a bit wear out
that with some chunky tights and make it
more wintry from Skull and Bones boys
club I got this really cute little
beanie baby blue beanie with a kind of
fuchsia pink logo it's gone bones it's
going bones boys club logo and I was in
a recent photo shoot that did so if you
look at my blog you place a female
picture of me wearing this and super
easy to wear really cute colors really
girly color so I love that from Primark
I got a couple of jumpers one Bing this
one so cute little fluffy lilac jumper
perfect with my hair and I also got it
in a baby blue as well which I love
which I can't find right now I'm not
sure where that's calm and I got two of
these and he's a 10 pound each and I've
worn them so much they're perfect with a
pair of like hike white cropped with a
pair of high-waisted soft leather
trousers or high-waisted trousers that
are quite patterned
brighten them up they are so good super
warm cute so I will do actually quite
let's get a few of these in different
colors I think we've got white they've
got lemon yellow black dark blue I think
so lots to choose from from misguided
I've got this place see if you follow me
on instagram and at in the throw on
instagram if you follow me on there you
might have already seen this all that's
recently for a night out and it's just
such a cute little piece to wear it
doesn't come with a belt but if you've
got any kind of belts that you can wear
it with I've got a little gold belt back
put with it super flattering it's
not overly short from the bomb and this
is 25 pounds I think then I've got this
beautiful jacket this is for a brand
calm mrs. Pomerance which i think is a
russian brand and it's just so lovely
I've been wearing this so much over the
white a soft top the pair of leather
trousers how much were the trousers a
lot you might noticed and it could go
over pair of jeans just as easily
it's beautiful long sleeved it's kind of
like a slightly longer jacket blazer and
no buttons boots off and no collars it
sort of sits around you but it's so
gorgeous the floor print it's so sort of
beautiful and something quite sort of
old-fashioned about it but covered with
a modern twist absolutely love it I
think this is a hundred fifty pounds to
buy but it's kind of on the soft
statement jacket so you'll probably get
so much wear out off so I adore that at
the moment then I also recently modeled
for a company called jaded London which
is amazing if you haven't seen them they
do so many gorgeous prints in jumpers
crops and joggers I can think so I've
got a pair of their joggers and like
this so comfortable and got a tie at the
waist when I make them a bit tighter
super comfy got the elasticated bottoms
so they put your ankles I've been
wearing these I've been wearing them
around the houses that come fees but
I've also been wearing them out with
boots and a top top ten just for a
really kind of cool Street kind of vibe
and I absolutely love these the kind of
it's that kind of fabric you remember
from like your youth when you used to
wear like tracksuit buttons and things
and that kind of really soft lovely
fabric it's beautiful and their new
season collection data model is stunning
there's a piece it's like a pink gingham
with turquoise and blue gingham all
mixed in and stunning so I'm gonna be
like buying that it tastes that when it
comes out so keep an eye out for Jade of
London that stocks in Selfridges top
sharp top mine was Ryland possibly going
into a sauce soon maybe so lots of
things coming up for them so there was a
firm jaded London then from Zara I got
these trousers which I love again super
cozy super comfy they've got last
created way so you have to worry about a
button and a lovely kind of lightweight
fabric super comfy that goes together at
the uncle's little cuff again I've been
wearing these with sort of tall ankle
boots
I don't wear flat boots anymore it seems
I realize that we were there I haven't
worn pair of flat boots in a long time
but a pair of like wedge boots a nice
soft body tucked into this or black tea
black cami and when you go to go so I
absolutely love those and they are think
they were 26 pounds from Motel another
one of my favorite brands got it's
beautiful placing and I have beautiful
as color is and I think this is one of
their new prints and it just goes into a
little place like this I've got one of
their other place weeks like this and I
just love the fit and the shape and
really cute little cap sleeves it
slipped at the back again so wearable
flight nice little nights out maybe like
date night I kind of think and this is
30 pounds I think then I've got this
beautiful little bag I mean have some
music I've got this on my blog recently
as a gift idea for me with Valentine's
Day and I've had so many comments on how
cute it is it's beautiful it's a little
pearl clutch for this little tiny chain
you drafter weather chain if you don't
want to you can tuck it away really cute
look a fastening on the top and it
really looks a little texture perfect
for like a really special event that
you're going to or a wedding absolutely
perfect for a wedding in fact if you
have a look at the vintage style website
they've got so many of these gorgeous
little tiny cultures are perfect for
wedding bridesmaids or for guests so if
you're planning the wedding when you go
into a wedding have a look at vintage
styler they've got some beautiful things
then one of the things I'm most excited
about this week is a shipment from
triangle if you've heard a triangle they
make swimwear and underwear and I have
enough to
they're sets for so long then I went for
the Dakota Superfly bikini which comes
with a spun down black top I got nine
and a small because I don't really like
it when it's so so tight bikinis that
kind of nearly popping out of them
forgot - small and it fits me perfectly
it clasps at the back like this there's
no way to change the size of the back
though so I'd bear that in mind if
you're buying I don't buy too big if
you've got quite a small back I'm a 30
round the back and the small is fine for
me it could you we've been slightly
slightly slightly smaller but perfect
you won't be falling down much for sure
so it's bear that in mind when buying
and then I got that and they come with
these which is the coral bottoms I
almost thought this these are the X no
these are small and I almost wondered if
these were going to be too big for me
but in fact because the way the fabric
is they fit perfectly and they're not
gonna give you soft double sides if it's
to tie off ously going to kind of a
ripple too much when it kind of hits as
your size so these fit perfectly and
they were almost like that rubber
neoprene fabric so almost like scuba
diving outfit so amazing so they go
together and you also recently launched
the triangle underwear range which is
absolutely beautiful and I got pair of
those how beautiful is this I think this
is called a Luffy bra and this is in the
champagne coral color it's more vibrant
and bright than it looks on camera then
in fact and all the pictures I've taken
up it took a picture of myself on
Instagram it shows me wearing this and
it looks a lot lighter and picture than
actually yes it's quite vibrant and
beautiful and bright and I absolutely
love it I got mine in extra-small and
again it fits me beautifully and we've
got a really good sizing yard in the
website so if you're not sure what you
what you should be you can go down to
the UK size is it it matches up your UK
size or the size you need in this so
it's really helpful and that obviously
comes with the matching bottoms as well
these are like a mesh fabric
lightweight mesh fabric so that's like
that the officer goes with the top and
they're just so beautiful I want to get
nearly ethical I love them I should also
mention this dress this is from love
with fashion and it's just beautiful
it's like a peach with these kind of
sparrows and birds all over it little
belt in the center
cute little floaty scare it's underlined
as well and Heights off shift neckline
it's so cute I think this is 30 pounds
or 35 pounds
I thought wear it today because I'm
going to a photo shoot later so I'm
wearing this for this lots of different
brands there's so many new things and
does absolutely love so hopefully you've
seen something you might like as well
the new season as always you can follow
me on instagram and twitter at in the
throat or my blog in the fro com if you
like to follow blogs please like if you
liked the video that'll be amazing and
subscribe if you know if you are new to
the channel give me some comments below
if you'd like me to film something in
particular give me some ideas some new
videos a be awesome a lot of people have
been requesting that I do sort of a
haircare hair routine video and I have
filmed haircare video already if you
want to self look back through my
archive and but I might do one a bit
more on my actual hair coloring I just
want to sort of make the point that I
don't dye my hair myself it isn't out of
a bottle and with a lot of people ask me
a lot where where do you get your hair
dye from and I have it done in the salon
so they bleach it and then the tone it a
little bit of kind of a pink or purple
dye and it pulls it to this color so
it's not out the bottle I'm really sorry
I wish I could be more helpful so yes I
really hope you enjoyed that and I'll
see you again soon bye
