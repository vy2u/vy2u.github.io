a new new in beauty video it's been a
while since my last one and I was just
sat in my office before thinking about
what I could film q guys I realized and
I'm surrounded by a lot of new products
these are going to be products that are
brand new to different brands so new
collections that also what two of them
are new to me so they may have been
released maybe six months ago but I've
only just got my hands on them so
they're brand new to me and also I kind
of want to show you what I've kind of
got in my collection as well so if
there's anything you really love and you
want me to make me do a tutorial with
leave it down below in the comments and
let me know so there's a palette I show
and you really want to know how to use
it better for example
please use this palette and tutorial etc
etc you get the gist but a lot of the
products here are new collection pieces
especially with cruise collection and
summer collections it's a lot of new
very very beautiful things to show you
so I've rounded them all up into this
big to your bag just I have them all
together I'm just gonna kind of dip in
find the best things let's just see what
we've got
I'm gonna start off with the SD edit you
may have seen my tutorial where pendel
Jenna's makeup artist Victor did all of
my makeup thank you so much for those
feedback on that video by the way so
many if you loved it a few if you didn't
like a few piece of the makeup but I
guess it was all good feedbacks it shows
you now you're not too keen on this if
maybe you're a blonde maybe not too keen
on the way such a thing was done and
maybe we can learn from that I don't
know where hopefully it kind of taught
me a lot as well so I'm really glad that
you gave me such feedback on that but
there are some products in that
collection that I absolutely love and
I'll just kind of bring them to light a
little bit more to pieces being the skin
glowing bomb and the flash illuminator
I'm wearing both now really really
digging these actually so the flash
Lomita is it looks a lot like to here
but when it comes out it's a little bit
seems deeper for some reason but it's
kind of like an illuminating radiance
cream that you can mix in with your
foundation just to make your skin even
more illuminated much more radiant etc
and then the skin glowing balm is a
foundation and both of them are quite
thick in texture so I've been adding
them both the backgrounds using a brush
and mixing them and then putting it onto
my face I find the coverage of the skin
glowing balm is somewhat media
maybe you can really build it up though
but it never gets too cakey it never
gets too heavy so if you like really
heavy flawless finishes this might not
be for you but it's really wonderful
medium coverage perfect for summer
perfect for those kind of like today's I
just still put it on with a brushed past
it a look with a bit of a sponge and I
really love the finish so those are two
great products from a new SD edit
collection and I feel another product
that is off note it's a Kendall si edit
palette but she came up with all the
different colors in here it's got a huge
mirror for a star and it's got 12
different eyeshadow shades and also
these two shades here silver and a gold
the cool thing about these I really like
is that the silver and the gold you can
kind of Pat them over your eyeshadow
even if you don't use these and they
they react to UV light so if you're
going out to kind of clubbing these will
sort of glow and light and really kind
of helps your eyes so every example I'm
going out tonight with my besties
loosing Lydia and and I'm definitely
worthy he's over top of my eyeshadow
just to make it a little pop a little
bit more I thought I'd mention X it's a
really great little palette good one to
carry around next up I'm gonna go with
L'Oreal they have a lot of new things
coming in I always find they're pretty
innovative L'Oreal so many great
products at the moment and I got to see
a bit of a kind of sneak preview of a
lot of things coming in very soon when I
was in camp but one of them being the
cushion dis Olay I'm not sure it is out
yet they already but it's like their
cushion foundation which i think is just
launched but this is more of a kind of
bronzing formula I've not even opened
this yet she's brand new but I have
played around with it in the showroom so
opens up you get a cute little sponge
it's all about that tap tap motion open
this up under here is the product so you
literally dab in and it's just so great
how much product actually comes out and
then you will just use it as a kind of
contouring bronzing kind of idea and
Leslie laptop so you just use it sort of
tapping away its skin and because it's
more of a creamy formula it'll really
help sort of set into the skin much
easier than a powder plus if you're
using the gel cushion foundation you can
kind of work the two together to create
this really flawless finish I think
that's really beautiful color I don't
know what cool this is I think it's a
universal shade the am really impressed
I think that's a really great product
and also coming in
true match highlighter and when I saw
this when I was being shown by the
Loreal makeup developers an artist as
that I need this in my life and luckily
they gave me want a little goodie bag
it's beautiful comes a little brush
underneath which is really adorable Anna
mirror which is even hand yeah and this
is just a really wonderful highlight
just a very champagne pink nudie
highlight
it is very illuminating it's not it's
not overly Sephora it's not the most
bright and glowing highlighter you've
ever seen in your life just that kind of
middle-ground up everyday highlighter
but really beautiful and of course more
affordable and also the gold obsession
range just coming in soon to L'Oreal
there are six shades of lipstick I think
and six nail varnishes so the idea with
these they've got like gold speckles and
those to make them a little more
brightening and illuminating so call it
six different shades this one almost
being like the feet to shade this is the
gold shade pure gold and whilst you
could wear it as a gold lipstick can do
they the artist showed us this over tops
like a red lip they did a really bold
red lip with the red from this
collection and then over the middle of
it that is the gold in fact all of the
whole lips it at the gold and it just
made this really shiny it kind of dampen
the red to more of an orange shade and
it just looks so glowy and incredible
it's a really cool thing to have in your
collection I think yeah so these are
coming in really soon and the whole
collection of them are so beautiful
these boy my favorite one this is beige
gold in terms of brushes there is a
brand called iconic London who have made
these cool little brushes so these are
super cute these are getting so much
popularity recently cause they're just a
really cool different way of flying if
your foundation your makeup I'm still
that little tooth brushes and just
thought I'd mention them because a
slightly alternative to the originals
and pretty cute in the rose gold and
black okay urban decay have brought out
their Alice in Wonderland palette this
is pretty cool so it's got a little
drawer that pulls out here house all the
shades and they're so there are 520
shades
what we have got a couple of Matt's
you've got a couple mattes 1 2 3 4 like
formats the rest are more shimmery very
pigmented
look how beautiful that looks and
there's also a little brush here as well
but then this opens and this is a cute
little I mean honestly would you ever
really look at this twice I'm not too
sure it's very kind of gimmicky
packaging it's very cool that I mean I'm
not dissing the packaging it's just
that's huge not if you want to take that
around with you is a massive palette I'd
much rather just had a flat palette with
them in it but I kind of get it and it's
fun it's funky packaging it's a bit more
fantasy but in reality is it that easy
to carry around not really
however the shades are really beautiful
and I mean this reflection here this
kind of very it's a matte shade as well
perfect crease color you've got a lot of
champagne in a highlight we've got some
beautiful shades here for outer crease
you can go a bit brighter and cooler for
with the different writer shades you
know like I could create a lot of
different shades I would wear out this
palette yeah wish the packaging was just
a bit slimmer another palette I wanted
to mention is from morphe I know this
isn't new but it's new to me I know I'm
going to be able to get a lot of use out
of it and I'm pretty sure this is soft
like the nudes palette boy it's pretty
great there are a lot of great shoes in
here again I could use similar to the
Alice in Wonderland palette brilliant
crease shades for kind of I like the
sort of crease shades are obviously
matte with a little tint of almost
peaches in there with taupe and brown
you know like everyone else really but
that's just what I really liked you so
soon as I see things like these two I'm
like yes they're great there is a nice
white maybe in a highlight right there
maybe champagnes there's dark darker
colors if you'd prefer more smoky so I
think this is kind of like everyday but
then you can also go more night with it
but the more smoky shades but there are
30 in here 7 45 45 shades so that is a
lot propellant and it's so affordable
it's so affordable and also very
pigmented and really quite beautiful at
that rose gold there how lovely is that
yeah I like that a lot not to mention it
Oh from Rosie for autograph from M&amp;amp;S
this new summer Rose shimmer body oils
rather pretty I must admit I haven't
even tried this yet but I was pretty
intrigued by it let's have a look
obviously you can kind of mix up the
pigments and the gold and all that
so this kind of thing that you take on
holiday slap it all of your legs at
night and it obviously it's meant to
give you quite a bit the shimmery oil
sheen yeah I imagine it kind of leaves
some like gold speckles of glitter on
the skin but nothing too much and I
imagine that's great if you've got
really dry legs this one I kind of
really handsome and create that Victoria
Secret leg look pretty beautiful fun
fact
rosie huntington-whiteley actually sat
next to me the other day on the plane to
Karen I had a mini fangirl moment and
then I was like she's just the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen in my
life
I really wanted to talk to her and kind
of pick her brain's about the industry
and kind of just say hello but I just
thought she wants some downtime I'll
leave it to it I was editing anyway so
but yeah so pretty from bareMinerals I
mentioned their concealer a lot that's
quite new their bare skin and anything
well this came in the other day and I've
already been using it and already really
loved it it said translucent powder duo
it has one called matte and one called
glow brilliant so it's like two shades
of light translucent powders both are
really beautiful actually this one is a
little bit more sock enhancing Alice use
this underneath my eyes yesterday it's
sort of brightening up and this one I
just use all over my face it's just a
really easy translucent powder if you
want something more matte is great if
you wanted something I mean it's like
this is a kind of palette that you could
use all over your face using them all
matte in areas like around your chin and
down your nose and your eyes and maybe
this morning your forehead and down you
know you know mix it up a bit but that's
pretty cool
do your recently released a fully
arranged about 16 maybe 12 16 of these
which are the Dior Addict ultra gloss
these are so beautiful this is my
favorite this
into six seven so real this is the kind
of thing that you could supply over any
lip color it listen handset it will just
have those light reflecting particles to
make your lips look really kind of juicy
but it's not too sticky in fact is it
sticky oh I don't think it is no it's
not it's not sticky at all it's just
wonderful but yeah really fallen for
this who's kind of like the only class I
use at the moment there's so many other
shades like if you're my pink girl or a
more of a coral tone oh this is really
beautiful actually why is this one this
is six four nine in Nova see what it
looks like yeah so it's got quite a lot
of color payoff
what's also something quite juicy and
somewhat glossy really beautiful and I
mean the packaging you can't really beat
you're so gorgeous um see my favorite
new wins from Devon she new lip balm I'm
a sucker for a good lip balm and this is
so pretty it's almost like a leather
pink casings the outside we have reduced
this and it opens up and inside you've
got a beautiful sort of baby pink balm
these kind of bombs I'm really not at
the moment because when you've got nude
lips or your roundabout you seem to put
on some lip balm this gives you a slight
color payoff like baby pink juic just
woken up kind of lips that's the kind of
Sheen it gives so that's the only color
payoff you get from these but they're
also really hydrating and really
beautiful I mean I can't pouch this one
yeah cuz I'm not tried it I've get to
try it and bit scared to look so perfect
and I kind of want to take pictures for
the blog first I know from experience
with other brands for example Dior do a
very similar one and it's like my go-to
lip balm so I think I'm gonna love this
just as much but keep an eye out I'll
let you know and also from it Siobhan
she is their new Prizm visage sake face
powders and we've got quite a few in
this range it comes with this cool tall
brush she's really soft and inside it's
a powder now these are two I thought
show you that I really love this is
Pauline Rose number three and this one
is number six organ set Miele
but they're really beautiful packages is
gorgeous these go from like a very light
shade through to like this is like a
second shade it's like a dark shade so
this is kinda thing I'd use a bronzer
this is sort of thing I'd use Mars kinda
like a setting powder potentially a
blush as well as want to go for
nude blush with a touch of that that
perfectly Lila but how beautiful of
these I thought they were absolutely
gorgeous I thought I've mentioned it as
well because I'm really excited about
these actually I went to a meeting and i
swatched them and they were really
really beautiful so for example this
watching this one yeah it's just some
real of coral toned bronzer thanks for
swimming out of a beautiful pretty
packaging so she's wrong she oh Tom for
Tom Ford of releases really cool lip
pens what are they called the patent
finish lip color this one I think is red
corsets this is more a big deep red and
use pop them up gun window its pic so
long the work out okay oh here we go
here we go here we go okay so red course
it's a really lovely Wow deep red it's
not too sticky it's a great color payoff
it's got almost it's got Sheerness to it
because it's almost a bit of a glossy
it's got a little bit of a gloss to it a
bit of a sheen but also a lot of
pigmentation that's beautiful that's red
course and I'm pretty sure you can build
it all coming up super dark ravisher and
that's just gonna kill me okay okay
rubbers yeah this is even dark wow
that's more of a kind of blood-red wow
that seems even more pigmented than the
last one these are really great I mean
how lovely like the way you can apply
these it'll be really quite easy for
application because the foot is so small
in for me I mean I've got quite a lot of
these shades but I cannot so I'll show
you a few in for me let's have a look at
this one oh okay that's more pink tone
like a deep fuchsia lovely yes mark it
off it's very deep blackcurrant II
fuchsia that seems like a Vassar we've
looked at of course it was looked at
exposed I'm pretty sure it's a really
nude in this collection but maybe it's
not
to see what this is like okay so that's
even more sort of deep plum deep plum
shade that's gorgeous too so it's a
lovely range of red such that I'm pretty
sure they also do a nude can't leave it
pick up a nude anyway point of this is
telford have these really cool new lip
colors beautiful packaging cool concept
a bit different not really seen anything
like this they're almost a bit kind of
look with lip esque but in this kind of
bulleted formula rather than a doe foot
applicator quite fond on those watch
this go everywhere now maybe I should
clean it can I be bother getting up not
really and you know what I'm gonna go
clean this up cuz it's all ice it's
gonna be a futile okay next up from by
Terry I don't think this is brand
brand-new but it's pretty new this is
the eye designer palette in smokey nude
and I'm just really light the style of
this palette I mean the way that they've
done these almost have little tiny
pockets of joy almost reminds me of like
ravioli the point it's kind of embossed
and impressed this way it's really
pretty but very cute little nudes
palette ranging from sort of like pages
and browns so it's beautiful peach so
pink in there's a lovely kind of rose
gold brown some blacks really really
wonderful pigmentation this is really
great pigmentation though what's a huge
mirror it's quite a good little travel
kit I guess and it comes with a brush
too but I'd mention it that it's really
pretty just a few more lipsticks as well
why sell have kind of re-released a
collection of maybe like 20 more of
these amazing kind of like Rouge for
looks Alex lipsticks these are the Rouge
for looks shines with a little bit more
shinier and you may know I love number
one and the Rouge flopped this is very
similar a little bit more Brown tone
this is number 44 which is an absolute
gem I absolutely love this isn't that
gorgeous so if you're looking if you
like number number one and read flocked
we wanted a little bit deeper and this
is kind of one to go file it's a little
bit more shinier although I do find
useful
it's pretty shiny anyway but yeah they
said this is more than sort of the shine
range so it's a little bit more I guess
it's a little bit more shiny and it also
tastes much better it's almost got like
a passion fruity taste and I'm not meant
to be eating in lipstick it does happen
when they're all over your lips you
can't help it sometimes the other rural
ups don't usually taste that great it
tastes very kind of synthetic whereas
you smell and taste much nicer at least
I have to mention these these are so
brilliant this about arranged about
twenty please news you a chew a lip
cream and I think how you seize him I
get ready with me in Santorini I'm
absolutely in love with them formula the
finish is beautiful they're just kind of
like a liquid lit that phase pot for as
long as you really need they have
wonderful colors in the range I mean
look at this one I mean the shimmer and
shining this one this one is such an aid
rose and it's just got a really
wonderful wonderful pigmentation payoff
of color but I mean the shimmery Sheen
on that it's just like Hello that is
just so gorgeous and there's like
there's like a rose gold in the range
it's like a golden color it's just the
kind of thing that you can add to the
century lips so it's like this eye altra
ombre shine highly recommended Clarins
have released Oh Clarence have released
a lot of things recently but this is the
one thing I really love fix makeup
long-lasting makeup hold it's just a
cute little fixing spray it's just
really lovely and I've been taking her
around with me everywhere but she ain't
Cabana they've released a new summer
range this is the Sicilian bronzer in
sunshine but how pretty is that
packaging can we don't shame Cabana
their clothing range right now is just
like so stunning but the fact they've
been cooperating it into the packaging
is really beautiful and it's a wonderful
look Rosa it's a great shade it's quite
a she but then he does have a certain
warmth to it it isn't to oranjee it's
not too dark it's just that kind of
everyday bronze I feel and it's got a
mirror beautiful packaging
I've got two similar products actually I
wanted to show you one from Gil on which
is the my terra cotta and it comes in
this really cool little case and opens
up into the terra cotta bronzer this is
a deeper tone and dachang cabana a
little bit more shimmery and has a cool
little embossing if you can see but yeah
really cute
we need our brilliant bronzers anyway
from Guerlain and also chanel how
beautiful this is packaging it matches
the allah beige range and it's opens up
to a cute little brush
this comes oh and inside is this cool
little bronzer this is like a very deep
shade and this is like a coral so when
mixed together just gives a very I guess
a coral deep bronze but this kind of
thing you would probably use your brush
to bronze and then a brush to blush a
blusher brush and I'm wrong the brush so
you can kind of get a brush and a
bronzer out of this I'll mix the two
together put a very soft coral tone very
deep summer bronze but it's beautiful
packaging gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous I'm
nearly there I promise to Mustangs lip
products from Giorgio Armani I hope I
can mention these because I'm not too
sure if I got these ahead of time or not
so I hope I can well you know I love
shorter Armani and these are their lip
tints I think lip maestro's so again
easy doe foot applicator this is super
shimmery and gorgeous yes this is 508
really lovely pigmentation quite satin
Sheen almost like velvet Sheen actually
not sticky smells lovely yeah it's a
really lovely color payoff as well I
mean things are look at that Janee way
oh that is so beautiful look at the way
that's gonna set down on the skin like
that's not going anywhere now yeah but
these have come in a range for about 12
or 16 I think ranging from like more
nudie to sort of deeper Pink's but
they're beautiful and last but not least
the new body shop insta glows this is in
bright glow this is in peachy glow and
there is a dark Avant as well but these
like CC creams so they go on
it's like a white cream and they blend
in
and there's the kind of thing that
you'll add over your moisturise are in
with your moisturizer to give you a
really soft perfected illuminated base I
hope you can see that this one CC cream
in peachy glow so this is my peach when
it comes out and you can rub that in
skin and it's just yeah it's just really
region really lumen a ting it kind of
affect the skin before you then go on
with foundation if you're someone with
amazing skin this is sort of thing you
could wear on its own alone for the day
and it'll just kind of enhance the skin
and make it look really beautiful I also
really like the packaging of these and
the whole idea oMG that is the end off
the bag okay that's a lot of things but
it's because I'm not doing a new in for
so long so those are all lots of the new
things that I've come into the shelves
