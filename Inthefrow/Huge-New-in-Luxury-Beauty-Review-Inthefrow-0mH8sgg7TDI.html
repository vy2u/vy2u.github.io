really really well in this video I'm
going to be going through all of the
newest new in beauty ranges and launches
especially in the more high-end
categories I think I might have one
drugstore brand mix in here as well but
mainly from high-end especially as a lot
of them are launching their for
collections runway collections and
Christmas collection it's coming up soon
I'm gonna kick this off with Christmas
perfume launches first up is I'm going
to take a selfie fashion yet it's the
victim Roth flower bomb for Christmas
and it's got this really cool almost
looks like an explosion like a firework
explosion and silver crystals coming off
so if your flower ball fan that's you
another one for Victor Ralph is the
bonbon
this is 50ml limited edition version of
bonbon with a pink diamond Tebow around
the bottle as well so they are beautiful
also got the giorgio armani v perfume in
limited edition it's got the cool little
gold like a golf bow embellished around
the edge of the box and then we take out
it has the same gold running right the
way around the bottle so if anyone helps
it loves this whether it's for your mom
your daughter your sister then this
limited edition bottle is really really
beautiful you exactly the same fragrance
it's just this in a really beautiful and
special bottle and the last path you
might have to show you is from Dior and
it's the j'adore - de parfum and
the idea with this is this is just a
multi credible thing it's an oil so this
is an oil-based perfume when you put
this onto your wrist it's so much
stronger and more concentrated than the
regular perfume
so for me I'm you know my skin seems to
seep up perfume and doesn't really exude
the fragrance that I wanted to but the
good thing about this being oil is that
it really really helps to intensify that
fragrance this smell totally reminds my
mom that she lost
j'adore it's just such a classic classic
fragrance and house bass notes and it
has the middle note but it doesn't have
any of the top notes of the fragrance
which means if you put this on you can
then layer it with your ordinary she'd
or perfume and it will be even brighter
and even stronger the new NARS and
Steven Klein color collection I recently
did a blog post all about this product
so I'll leave that link down below so
you can go and have a look at those of
swatches and me wearing them as well
three glasses a kind of roasted red a
deep blush pink and a plum a more gothic
slummy lip gloss I've got three
lipsticks two of which nude one of which
is a raspberry one of them is more of a
opaque nude the other one is a more
reflective and shimmery nude that one's
called redemption so we don't use a
shimmery nude you've got Besame Mucho
which is a nude without Simek and you've
also got no shame which is this lovely
raspberry plummy shade I thought said
all swatches of these can be found on
the blog they also have three nail
polishes in shimmery and on this duo
chrome style so purple which is night
creature which put my favorite here this
one is hard to get which is a metallic e
pewter greeny gold almost and then here
we have black fire which is a slight
gray blue for my favorite thing in this
collection have to be a little
individual eyeshadows this one
especially my favorite this one scoffs
dude I think this is going to sell out
so quickly it's a very iridescent silver
pewter with so much pigmentation it is
almost crazed it's almost got an olive
toned silver metallic pewter canoes I
don't
to that but that is incredible
absolutely adore that and they've also
got mortal which is a very bright white
shimmery snow shade and also this one
it's never too late which is an
olive-green car key
so those three together makes such a
beautiful eye look they are beautiful
especially for autumn into winter with
those kind of cocky olives this next
product I wanted to mention it because I
don't think it's necessarily new but
it's new to me and I am totally smitten
with it it's the temple spa glint shadow
concealer sits concealer that house is
really cool brush in fact I've got one
here that I'm already using that's got
that one ready for to go next time but
you saw pump up product into the brush
and it's got quite a thick lovely thick
consistency to it but it's really great
for coverage and just blending into the
skin and it's quite high coverage wow
this is really great shape for me it's
and light I try and find somewhere that
they sell it I'm not even sure what
temples fire is sold so I find out she
products you've probably seen so much
off but I've just gotten into my
collection brand-new from Charlotte
Tilbury the magic foundation I have
heard so much about this and also the
mini miracle I want which Suzy from
Hello October absolutely adores urban
Latanya - you need to use this it's got
an under-eye cream that have really lift
the under eyes and it's quite tightening
a third and then this is the
illuminating soft focus
eye brightener so then you use the other
side although news with the magic
foundation this is meant to be so sort
of medium to high coverage and buildable
but you can do wonders for the skin I've
seen Charlotte putting this on people
that have acne or scarring or dark
pigmentation and literally it just blows
everything out so very excited to use
this this isn't shades three which i
think is going to be too dark for me in
honesty I might go down to shoot too but
very excited about though
and I've heard so much so if you're near
a shark tail recount to maybe go have a
little peak exciting product from
associate Beverly Hills again you're
placing us everywhere I have the shade
starlight and it's their new
illuminators very silvery gold shade but
it just it's so brightening on the top
of the transom up everywhere like my
skin just looks radiant now it's really
gorgeous and Starlight I've seen a lot
of people speaking about this I think
this might be one of the faves for the
collection there's a few different
colors listen especially it's a small
the lightest one it's more silvery like
gold
next are two new nail shades from Chanel
I'm just in love with in fact I've got
them on now although I need to reapply
cuz I've had a bit of a busy weekend and
it all stops coming off now this one is
in shade 673 singulair it's a very kind
of bright raspberry plum it's not got
that all it's not got that very autumnal
plummy shade that we all seem to wear
all the time it's in a bit more bright
it's a bit more girly in a bit more
feminine than that sale which is why I
think I read a little bit and then this
one is 675 true blunt a in a moment I
have it on this nail here and everything
else is so it's the more raspberry shade
I think they go really beautifully
together because it almost looks as
though this shade is kind of similar to
what this looks like in the light you're
going to see that but beautiful so those
love got some new bits from Maybelline
the colossal go chaotic Volume Mascara
this is perfect for people who really
prefer then Escarra
to be more spidery larger more volume
eyes I'm just very chaotic and all over
the place if you light your eyelashes
really straight and perfect than this
isn't to you so you sort of put on your
mascara as normal and then you use this
section at the top that's all very own
uniform and you use that to brush
through your lashes and it will help to
really kind of mess them it just messes
up your lashes completely so you get
that very spidery mess wait for it it's
chaotic
does chaotic lash so if you like the
idea then Maybelline have you covered
we've also just brought out a brand new
color tattoo this one is in shade creme
de new 293 and this reminds me of a
mixture between like banana powder and
kind of Mac Paint Pot in ochre is it or
something similar I really like the look
of this and I think this will be a big
hit with those that just want to use a
very little eye shadow and can just stop
dip the hand in put it over top of their
eyelid and it will just create that kind
of flawless eyelid base and the last
thing is the master brow Pro palette
from Maybelline the idea with this is
that instead of it being 3 different
shades but I really like about it so
it's a highlight a brow shade at works
so the amount of times we've bought
these sorts of palettes and I've used
one shade out of it
and then every other shade goes away
somewhere long could have put a
highlight or it could have something
else it's almost like Maybelline have
come to my rescue and done that so with
this one product you can put the wax
through your brows then you can use the
powder and put that through as well so
you get the perfect shade and then you
can use the highlight underneath or
above or however you like to use your
highlight so I thought it was a really
cool product and of course it comes with
a brush not going to ever recommend
youth leave but it's good for the girl
on the go next up we've got you should
Vashi this could be their autumn winter
collection
I think this white snowy glittery case
there are six shades which are
completely spot-on for this autumn and
so for me this sticks
all of my boxes this one I've been using
as a crease the soft peachy beige these
on the crease use the white on the inner
corners and then I've been using the
olive all over the lid and then using
the different types of brown to really
darken up the crease and also underneath
and it's so stunning packaging the
product
blend ability the pigmentation it's
absolutely gorgeous that's so beautiful
and also brought out a matching lipstick
gorgeous case I've got some red online
now - really good about but it just
comes out like this and this is the
shade that they've gone for it's a light
cherry red next we have illamasqua and
these my two faves from their new
Christmas collection this one being a
multi-use product it's a stunning gold
water and the idea is that you can build
up on your eyelids on your cheek so on
your lips and it will give the effect of
gold leaf something called be using that
so much over Christmas I think that's
going to be a best-seller and also these
false lashes Illamasqua make some
gorgeous false lashes and these are so
wispy and so feathery and fluttery i
will try and find out what exactly they
are all it says in here is 5 d07 by
doesn't obviate it's been the holiday
Christmas collection so I'll link those
if I can to new lipsticks from the
Burberry kisses range
the first being 297 Midnight's love just
kind of says it all really a very clumsy
dark mysterious Pony shade I think it's
gonna sell out so well it's almost a
ready Brown feel to that and then
hydrangea which is more of a deep dusky
mature pink shade so those are you from
Gregory a few more things to show you
first of all from Giorgio Armani their
new runway collection is so beautiful
each product comes in these little bags
and when you open it inside ok this is
my kind of blush it's a peachy peachy
light pink then up inside there are
three eyeshadows black a more peachy red
and it won't this is kind of more of a
limited edition collector's item type
piece I feel it's very special piece I
really love about this collection is
this your Cimiez and these before but
this is a new shade it doesn't actually
sound here what it is because I think it
just cuz it's part of the runway
collection well this I adore I've got a
blog post coming up or have been already
posted Ali
the link down below if so it's also very
metallic bronze shimmering time from
dawning so beautiful it blends gorgeous
as well on the LEDs I have this on in
the day in a full makeup look and it
just blew me away another piece in that
collections well that I really love and
I like the fact that the Browns have
gone for a more coral tone lipstick
rather than to sticking to the plums and
the Reds that we're just seeing so much
off light peach coral but quite also
quite bright
it is very different this Tammy and I
love that fact it's just kind of the
third sign of autumn leaves type oranjee
peach I love it a little bit so that's
the beautiful collection a very very
last thing to show you are from Chanel
this is a raspberry strawberry red and
say this is shade 164 inspire this is a
very Ottoman or brown with a hint of the
kind of pink through it
I just think that'll be incredible for
the Ottomans I'll be wearing that a lot
I know that now and also shade 53 in the
ruler of velvet and I missed you use
this looks incredible it's like a matte
it's meant to be sort of velvet finish
on the lips it it looks I've got about
half the lipstick for the practice
session now over the lipstick boy is so
pretty
it's a lot of information that I really
really hope you enjoyed that and team at
least off come away loving at least one
products that you think you might have
to have a look at I'll look for I'm
really excited about a lot of these
products or else I wouldn't have put
them in this video so it's no pop me
