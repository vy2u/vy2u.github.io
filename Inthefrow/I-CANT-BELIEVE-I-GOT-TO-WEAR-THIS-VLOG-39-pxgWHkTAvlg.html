lemare event obviously Qatar is lommers

new foundation is Charlie and I think
it's number 12 natural

go to moisturizer just because I feel
like when girls are paying me to do
their makeup they want to last as long
as possible and they want to run around
and of course a bit crazy now with
huh-huh skin and then just eye makeup on
so one just finished up by my skin fresh
