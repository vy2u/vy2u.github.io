Google please stop okay so I thought I'd
do like a little mini catch-up Jack I
just spent the afternoon writing up a
new blog post due to the fact that we're
doing so much traveling recently I've
really been trying to keep on top of the
blog in terms of my it's kind of style
outfits
what I usually do on the blog if you
follow the blog you'll know I like to
kind of show all the outfits I wore with
a little bit of kind of like a blurb
about them and maybe show some other
things that you can get that very
similar so I took a lot of alternatives
and different price categories or
sometimes I just like to use pictures
one second anyway um and with other
pictures I like to write about more like
personal topics whether it's them to do
with how I'm feeling or whether it's
person that's going on in the world or
if it's just about personal feelings
maybe something about self-confidence
that I steam about absolutely anything
but this vlog goes round before I want
to do some pictures of that it taken in
India just to do like a full write-up of
everything that happened in India
because it was just fun the best trips
I'm just gonna finish off that section
of blog post I did like nine different
blog posts by India hope we have seen it
