late now it's half past seven after the
Dior show we got out of there it was a
bit of a rush to get away in the traffic
to get to the station to get on it to
get on the next year's star we which
they managed to get the Eurostar with in
about ten minutes so it was pretty lucky
actually so what I should get home a
little earlier than we expected and I'm
just unpacking now I'm a little stressed
though because my plans have slightly
changed I thought I was heading to Paris
back to Paris on Thursday but actually
I'm heading back tomorrow tomorrow

having to pack tonight and repack and
doing all my packing now and to get that
door earning to tan each other like you
