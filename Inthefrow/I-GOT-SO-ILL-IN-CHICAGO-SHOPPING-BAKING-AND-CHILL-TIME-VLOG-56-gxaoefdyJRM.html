like the fact actually the inside oh
it's amazing it's so good so yeah like I
said it's on the blog recipe yeah
everyone really enjoyed the food I'm
really pleased welcome to morning I'm
sure what Davis illness I didn't do any
logging yesterday because it was just
like a full chill day and something
really to sort of show else it's one in
a bit of a day off but now I am ill I
really like boggy had bad throw that
cold my whole body just feels like it's
about to shut down but I really wanted
to take some pictures today so I'm
putting on some makeup and I figured I
hadn't done like it get ready with me at
the bathroom mirror it in a little while
so I've been getting ready now so I go
for better film some things so else a
lot of people been asking me what
highlight I've been wearing it's a
Charlotte Tilbury one beauty light wand
sorry so snotty and Snively so yeah I
just add it on and I you use a brush on
my fingers just to like blend that in up
here it just looks really like natural
it really blends in well it's more of a
cream and it's so easy to use I get a
super quick put some under Ramon over
album dr. Webb enough so in our existing
people oh he knows he'll use all of your
foundation off if you know so I'm gonna
keep applying it and applying it and
apply no I just figured that if I can go
out and take these pictures I really
take today then I can get back well this
morning then I can get back and I can
chill then for the rest of the day
and just do work from the sofa with a
big cuddly throw of me and dougie by my
side that's the idea right so then when
that's all nice a blended oh my head
when did my tribe the RMS Luminizer

the foundation I'm using in fact the
only one I brought on this trip it's my
CC cream I know it works really well and
it's a little bit lighter bringing a big
bottle of glass foundation work pretty
