over to the Tori packard show this
morning
okay so for this lock okay so you may
not know it but Victoria Beckham has
brought her whole new line with Estee
Lauder there's like six six different
collections in there this is a New York
look the a London market only look at
cetera seeing as I'm in New York I
thought it was apt to do the New York
look because it's just amazing no need
to embarrass a little bit of my nude
cushion-shaped a bomb of course I know I
wasn't to finish everything with some of
the nails this isn't a shame okay now
I'm even getting to some of the
collections this is the New York look
I've got saffron Sun bronzer we've got
the little eye palette at the orange and
blue got incredible Victoria lipstick in
nude this is beautiful - glass of the
top also Victoria lip liner in the nude
and also the black kohl and vanilla call
this is what I'm working with you over
there is saffron bronzer blender is down
the neck so it's all nicely blended and
also using it a lot on the apples of my
cheeks
it's more of a bull she drowns it kind
of feel no no again this is a part of
the New York clock but I really wanted
to use this highlighter obviously
and I don't really need to do this but I
already fly a bit the or Abbas as well
roof on top I'm gonna take the bronzer
I'm a nice fluffy brush you can work
that into the crease
Versalles almost then I use this
incredible highlighter on a flat brush
and we're gonna pack that onto the lid
now take a small brush now I'm gonna go
into this gorgeous little palette and
also take the orange just into my crease
quite lightly in a color of the orange
killed but not being killed the top and
that just looks so beautiful I love it
so much what's up - Dave this is your
planner this blue and I take a little
bit how much have a an angled brush but
I don't know anyway
I'm going to take it on this brush and
work it into the lash line
I rubbed it so softly into just out to
lash line at the top and then really
quickly smoked out with Morse you've got
little wings absolutely honest I'm so in
love with this look it just looks so
pretty my pencil is good yes it's really
creamy we're not - you're creating
victori nude

a new VP connection which is all about
very fresh natural skin very fresh like

look really lovely so really nice to
hear that is my head about what's now
I'm getting a little coffee start of the
day I'm at 5:15 I'm probably going to
crash a little bit it could have some
coffee

your new collection which product would
you recommend to them skin perfecting

makeup which three products would you
choose first skin perfecting powder

I ruined one I absolutely love it goes
with everything and then my dear heels
it was Republic all at my Coach bag
you can walk into those sterile white
offices you want to do this before the
business actually
so does her really special private or
around mrs. Estee Lauder's private
office which is like such honor like not
that many people get to and have a look
it was so beautiful and so pristine and
yeah absolutely amazing but the view
from this on the 40th floor in the Estee
Lauder kind of head office building it's
absolutely incredible view right over
Central Park
oh it's just absolute beautiful
and back to the hotel room for a very
very quick change I'm into my final
outfit of this trip it's a Victoria
Victoria Beckham dress I'll leave it
linked and also these boots are so
dreamy I love these are gonna link this
link down below but we're going now for
some blood drive so I'm going at my hair

looks a bit awful now so I'm gonna get
it blow-dried and put into a bit of a
style for tonight

and about I don't know me about 19 think
it's about 20 both different bloggers
youtubers instagramers from around the
world have been selected especially to
meet Victoria in a really intimate kind
of want to one kind of setting and which
is an absolute honor to be part of that
it's like a really exclusive thing and
yeah we've been selected to be the ones
that get to kind of spend a bit more
time
VIP here Victoria Beckham anyway right
on to blow-dry this is the menu I think
I want to go do its martini
maybe see that in the product
this is very very honest there is
nothing in this collection that I don't
myself yesterday so the note that I had
on the dodge yesterday really was
celebrating perfect skin there's a
really little part of the collection
which you use with every city look as
well so I started using the morning aura
which is which I would say probably the
hero products from the first collection
