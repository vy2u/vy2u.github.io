now a.m. we work about three often with
the jetlag and also out the window on
the strip they've closed off the strip
police had to like allow I think they
were shooting for me to a car movie so
there was loads of a really loud car
noises which also would have woken us up
if we haven't get away however the Sun
is just coming up now or Vegas you sort
of see it breaking over there over the
desert in the hills and it was awesome
today's an exciting day we're going to
the Grand Canyon on a helicopter in the
wind dance at all with maverick
helicopters the five of us is like a big
tree I wanted to show my dad the Grand
Canyon I've been there twice now I've
walked it and I've done helicopter over
it but I know done it from Vegas so
flown from Vegas I would say Grand
Canyon he watched in London saw the
Grand Canyon so for me obviously it's
prime time to take some pictures so I
thought I'd show you I'm wearing today
so you'll see this is not coming blog
post as well and Instagram and all that
but main pieces here are from reserve so
you may have seen a while back I went to
Poland with reserved had a really cool
funny trip we had such a good time so
I'm working with those guys again and
they've asked me to pick out some mini
called denim pieces which was like
beyond perfect for this shoe so I've got
this really cool pair of jeans
I mean don't obviously when they go on
me they won't look like this cuz it'd be
nice and tight but they're just been in
my my case but I'm just some nice
distressing to the jeans and I like the
fact that there's pockets I thought that
the lighter shade just kind of mix up
the shades a little bit and add
something of it unique and otherwise
it's a very skinny easy Jean but they
fit like a dream and got these in 234
and I'm usually like a size 6
really easy organic cotton tee it just
feels that really nice quality I think I
got this in a small yeah I got this in a
small so it fit a little bit more a
little bag here a bit more oversized I'm
just going to tuck that in to real jeans
no the top I wanted to go double denim
so I got two dead ends that carry enough
matched because I thought that a lot
best I love this absolutely love it it's
got a really good shape to it it kind of
is elasticated around the waistband so
that kind of since she's in slightly
I like this two-toned denim
that's happening on the pockets and the
arms and a little bit on the collar it's
got a really great shape little pockets
I'm about to need to break those open
it's brand new
yeah but it's a really cool jacket and
it goes really well with these pieces
that were perfect for the Grand Canyon
then for accessories this is the hat
that got yesterday from Gorham brothers
how gorgeous is that very different for
me but I just thought it would be
awesome for the shoe I've got feather in
it you can get a little accessories to
put in the hats too and then for other
accessories I have a gorgeous new Jimmy
Choo bag from Monty f-4s feels such like
amazing quality it feels that really
sturdy and really thick and yeah
gorgeous little bit with these stars and
embellishments all over it and then for
shoes I know that I'm going to be in the
Grand Canyon might a train is too but if
the actual shoot I really want to shoot
these because you look I've tried on
this whole outfit together and they look
for really really cool just with like
the black really pointy hall shape to
them so they look really good too so
this is today's outfit okay I'm ready
and makeup to the max I nice and curly
and I have my whole lot confidence which
is kind of very appropriate I feel for
like desert vibe feel very kind of okay

chill and then watch the rev really
really excited I just wish I had my
glasses like this is what I'm wearing I
realized that I'm wearing a shilling
jacket but it's actually really cold and
the casino is because of the amount of
light air that's in there and a/c it

wearing that with my Christoph's cost

about watching it's meant to be
incredible best show in Las Vegas just
making our way in to watch Laurette this
book did a we are row a station
oh my god it's exhausting
come on a guy should be Venetian Hotel
that's sort of beautiful in here today
is roadtrip day we have just spent about
hours trying to order a car so we've
just confirmation because I hurt like
our garbage inside of the Venetian good
tip for if you're wanting the car don't
go all the way back to the airport to
pay one huh
so we've got an SUV we're gonna drive to
Zion National Park I think hopefully
taking in Valley of Fire on the way we
can see all of this in a minute go to
the Denny's so um great hell yeah we
wanted a dirty greasy breakfast so we
came to a Denny's in our SUV check out
this little guy very cute it's not quite
a convertible but it'll do I really had
these aspirations have having like an
incredible convertible car to take the
pictures with in the desert book
the SUVs rather comfy them yep
yeah this is happening this is
everything right now this is peanut
butter topping with nuts
extra peanuts and a chocolate chip and
white chocolate chip pancake and I have
a side of eggs toast and hash browns and
a mangos meaning getting in those
calories getting those calories
we're on a road trip to fishapod
anything we're on the road to dance
that's in the driver's seat we're on the
interstate
valley of fire state park
it's insane here absolutely gorgeous
nothing expected just i'm guessing
everything so red because the iron and
it rusts apparently in the sunshine yeah
it's the iron in the rock and it's
totally like rusted so it's all red
we're not in California yeah but I
actually think that's that's what it is
so it looks amazing though super cool
and it took us only 50 minutes from
Vegas to get here maybe an hour $10 in a
car and that's it so highly recommend if
you get car so we're just kind of
exploring the area been taking some
pictures which I'm sure you'll see soon
if not now in fact I'll put it here if
you can see it yeah it's been taking
some pictures for a collaboration I've
been working on the idea was to go to to
Zion National Park without some of the
two hours or so away so because we came
here we thought we could never do both
but in fact I think it's gonna be a long
long day if we do do that so in fact I
think we're just gonna explore more of
this State Park actually and just go
around here for the day
this is amazing - we've just come to
this area called Seven Sisters and we've
got these massive massive rock
formations seven of them so but with our
little picnic break here back at the
hotel changed hair washed showered new
makeup and we're on our way out the game
comes in go go go go go when you're in
Vegas so we're on our way out with some
food not too sure why - yeah should do
more research really on restaurants is
there anything I have kind of regret we
should look to my restaurants but I'm
sure we'll find somewhere delicious
although always very overpriced over
here but I might so smart - Baker shoes
- Baker trousers and all the shirt
where's this from this is nice ass is it
and I'm sort of smart casual my new
Jimmy Choo bag and my canopy
well guys is actually a left day today
which I'm really actually good about I
thought that four days that's over four
days would be like enough time without
so I wish we'd do five days I feel like
I really wish would have worn X today as
well
but anyway last day today me nots Justin
did a little bit of working bad because
last few days have been like early
mornings do a little bit of work getting
that ready you just posted my bum on a
video on Instagram which I'm super proud
of we spent loads of time filming that
Louis of time and today that a big thing
went into that so were you not seeing
that already I hope that you have a look
over Instagram I hope you like it so I
think we're gonna go get a coffee
pretty excited about getting little
Starbucks coffee for the morning and
we're just gonna head out if I'm just
gonna go look through some of the
different hotels that was not seen
before look through all the different
casinos yeah just just have a little
moved around really beautiful beautiful
views out of here today
what did you order I oughta pumpkin
spice repellent a little drill a little
trunk they strip it was rumored as well
that this is going to be closing down by
I believe oh I don't believe it
supposedly one of the biggest
attractions in Vegas that's completely
free
yeah so they make no money on it they
lose money we heard they were gonna be
imagine I predict of Elijah
totally would totally ruin all these
restaurants with Luis every new you
couldn't sell the fountain perience and
it
I don't think that's true
bitch
design really good girl unless you want
to pay for shoes
so we walking around for the five places
go we're just gonna rename the cream of
Chinese
we couldn't play
Oh
refried beans with sour cream looks
delicious
sometimes by the pool although the subs
completely gone
this machine may be got 15 minutes by
the time I managed to get down here in
costumes I'm gonna go get ready for
tonight
we're going to Fremont Street now to see
the big lightshow I'm gonna have to
drink I'm watching their do some
gambling tonight is great but it's like
really expensive for minimum bets on
tables

we're gonna go upstream on Street it's a
little bit more affordable and we can
get the ears and joy night going on I am
fully makeup to watch so it doesn't this
handsome one ready to go out again um
just to show you what a where we now
show you here in this mirror don't mind
the messy bathroom right now yes so

here seeing us it's like November so I'm
just wearing my Nina reversible
shearling jacket Jane come on a bag and
then on my feet my Louboutins so oh you
