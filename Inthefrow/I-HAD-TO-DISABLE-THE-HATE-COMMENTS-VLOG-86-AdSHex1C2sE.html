this brand-new flower bomb nectar from
Victor melt very excited as you know a
massive flop off am so excited that hi
guys I'm back from the day it turned out
to be a longer day than I imagined our
and about I was hoping that you'll get
my nails done I'd come home and get back
to working but as it happened my nail
took a little bit longer cuz she was
really
thora and amazing I have Monica and they
look so cute so that took a little bit
longer but then I went to join the juice
mine no sick for my sandwich which was
Bob and what bumped into a lovely lady
whom he lives in Manchester and actually
worked some misguided as well which is
very cool she was she was saying hello
she watched my channel so that was
lovely and then I walked over I just
know I got cabover tickle him because it
was them it was raining and then
whenever I go to gleam I end up spending
my hours there every single time when I
don't even mean to so I was there for a
lot longer than I intended to be just
but not a peel box beauty items and some
fashion bits for this trip so excited
about this trip on Sunday by the time
you see this will already have been
there for a few days but I've just been
yeah loads of stuff is arrived today for
me to learn and really excited about it
so you'll be seeing all that in the
Maldives on Instagram so if you're
watching this now head over to my
Instagram in the fro have a look look at
what I've been wearing what we've been
up to
I'd love to kind of see your comments
and see see what you think of the
pictures cuz also we spent so long
creating these pictures it's always so
nice to see the comments and read what
you guys think so thank you guys talking
of comments though yesterday I could not
believe it you guys may have seen that I
recorded a me-too video a story of
sexual assault that I had years ago and
I did a me-too video about it as part of
the whole me - movement I wanted to
continue the conversation about it I
mean that video now has like foond a
thousand views your comments were insane
like I was amazed by how many people
that video managed to help and the
number of comments that I got off you
guys that were absolutely incredible and
we just got a really good conversation
going around it and I was so glad that I
opened up anyway yesterday was
international women's day and the
summaries and YouTube had decided to put
that video on to the homepage of YouTube
normally I would be extremely thankful
of this because it opens opens up your
videos to a whole new audience and it's
also really great for growth and for
other people seeing your videos it would
never you to see if it is however I feel
like it was a very odd decision to put a
me-too video on the International
Women's Day page only because it's just
interesting Women's Day is about
celebrating women and great women and
everything that's happened before and
the women that were behind certain
movements in the past that have meant
that we have the life we have now and
it's about celebrating women it's not
about talking about I didn't personally
think that we should shine a light
necessarily on the whole me to movement
on that day particularly every other day
ups it fine but I felt like women's day
it wasn't necessarily about that anyway
so it went on CG page and the number of
comments that I got from perverted sick
degenerate males on that video because
it's in the home page was absolutely
vile I got hundreds and hundreds of
round'em comments with just the most
disgusting perverted things you could
ever read rape threats really violent
violent comments these are from people
that don't know me don't watch my
channel have absolutely no interest in
me and literally saw the video decided
to click it probably were a bit pissed
off because it was an international
men's day and and didn't like the fact
that women were being empowered that day
and decided that they wanted to say
something really hideous to a woman
about a sexual assault that she had I
mean literally you could not write it
people are so disgusting like there are
real scumbags in this world the lowest
of the low of the low people and they
all happen to be on YouTube that hanging
on my homepage just looking for
something to drill like a lot of Pete I
mentioned on Twitter a lot of people saw
like oh you know upset about it and
which not even slightly upset or
concerned about it I'm more concerned
about the world and the population and
the fact that these people exist and
also from things I've seen in the past I
remember watching that troll TV show
about trolling and they weren't found
again
ivan was a big big troll and draw a lot
of women he just turned out to be like a
four-year-old normal guy living in a
random house somewhere who just got his
kicks off to saying disgusting things to
people it's just really funny isn't it
like people are so yeah some people are
disgusting
I like she's home with alcohol mmm Alex
nipped out to get himself some beers for
tonight Oh breakfast too tonight
they went out to get some beer think you
wanted to get me it's got me some tonic
water so I can have gin if you're in a
pub you wouldn't bat an eyelid but the
out-of-the-way best selection that's
yeah no yeah so that's what happened
yesterday so in the end I had to disable
the comments on that video because I
thought as long as this video is on this
homepage it's gonna get loads and loads
of more hideous comments and it took
hours just going through them all
deleting them blocking these disgusting
people so they can never come back again
yes when I'm had to disable comments on
the video and I never have to do that
before so I was just yeah disgusted by
the people that were around just stay on
international what this team and every
other day as well anyway so yeah like I
like this making dinner
well and I said are you making breakfast
food I said I was with my manager
earlier else with Amy and I like to make
my favourite food late and she's like is
he making breakfast food like how do you
know she's like I just know you like I
know you so well I only made it the
first time the other day and you were
like oh my god this is the best meal
you've ever made yeah but think about
how much I love avocado toast this is
not a Mikado no I know it's not but it's
perhaps breakfast food I love breakfast
food that's like brunch no it's British
and breakfast isn't it
yeah I'm dead excited mmm my favorite I
can't wait for tomorrow can't wait for
tomorrow I seen Amelia an obscene Carly
tomorrow Carly's back from Kilimanjaro
if you haven't watched Carly's video
yeah she climbed Kilimanjaro with 16 of
her followers which is amazing like the
pressure of that make sure her followers
were okay while she was struggling she
was really
she made it to the end a few of her
followers didn't unfortunately make it I
don't think I would have enough to make
it I mean I might be selling myself
short here but I mean I get very sick
and nothing else do you think this would
have got me very early on but I think
I'm so proud of them so proud of us so
if you want to watch something that's
very empowering buy a really gorgeous
person and just also if you're
interested in climbing Kilimanjaro yeah

then I'll just go home and mean I've
just been looking at the pictures of new
villas that we're going to tomorrow in
the maldives and we're just so so
excited in fact I don't think I've
actually mentioned why we going to the
Maldives again for anyone that's like as
if she's gone for Maldives
again I realized what we weren't in
January that was would benefit and that
was a very last-minute trip this trip to
the Maldives tomorrow is a holiday guide
planned with Alex a couple of months ago
I booked it before the benefit trip so
I'm so I'm just gonna go cancel it so
what you know it's more than a couple
months come on you know but didn't like
Fairmont go didn't we so it's been it's
been boxing for a while so smart how
kind of holiday retreat kinda thing for
a bit of time together after fashion
months after a really kind of busy god
busy fashion and this place we're going
to look Gilley lankan foushee in the
maldives it looks absolutely idyllic and
we just want some time together some
like romantic time some time to chill
together obviously I'm going to be
working still but very hopefully a bit
more chilled out working
so yeah so that's why we're having to
Maldives trips kind of back-to-back but
it's just because hours of the holiday
and the benefit one was a bonus
additional trip to the Maldives that
happened to be the Maldives but I'm not
complaining hopefully you guys will
still love the content hopefully it'll
give you some inspiration for your
spring trips summer trips away I'm
taking loads of bikinis with me loads of
summery clothing so hopefully I'll be
nice bit of inspiration for you guys
because that's the whole reason I do
this kind of thing yeah we're looking
forward to that tomorrow I've pretty
much all packed but before then I just
wanted to go through the rest of my
wardrobe because although yesterday
yesterday I went through my swimwear
draw and this is everything that I
pulled out my swimwear draw but I
haven't worn oh I tried on every single
piece here just to check if it still fit
me if I like the fit if I felt good in
it anything that I didn't feel was
perfect for me it's now here or if I've
worn it enough times if I'm not sure not
sure anymore so this is all gonna go to
the British Heart Foundation as always
listen all of my clothes the British
Heart Foundation and the Kilburn store
is our nearest Heart Foundation so
that's where this is all gonna go in a
couple of weeks I figured what I would
do is just go through a few more drawers
and pullout even more clothes just so
that's all done I don't know why I want
to do that tonight but I'm gonna have a
little lock oh I like something clean up
the house add a blessing you clean the
whole house now it's a bit of a tip
again but I'm just gonna go through and
tearing up some things also my besties

more so all the way from Chicago she
bought this for me it's been sent to me
and it's just got loads of gorgeous bath
balm so when I use some later have a
really really good exfoliating scrub so
that I can return tonight and look like
