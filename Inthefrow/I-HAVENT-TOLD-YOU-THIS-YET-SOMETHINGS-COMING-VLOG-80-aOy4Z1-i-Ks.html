to insert color into your wardrobe in
different ways so again I'll leave that
link if you'd like to see that so
that'll be up later today I am just
going out again for meetings I've got a
couple of meetings and I'm gonna get my
nails done
I've lost a nail here cuz it broke I
know your hinge yes so this week is
literally so busy if I found it panic to
my voice it's because I have I have so
many projects on I have so many meetings
in this just a lot going on this week
like a lot of things I'm going to New
York on Friday I've not even got
anything new to where I'm just like
panic I'm so pleased
I found this jumper the other day what
was I looking at so I'm looking at a
blog post a really old video and I
remembered I spotted this jumper and
I'll find where has that jumper been I'm
not seeing it it's like a Joseph one and
it ties at the back little black tie
I mean I've tied it quite tie here
usually have it that off shoulder and I
love it's like a lovely cashmere jumper
it's from Joseph so it wasn't exactly
like super cheap and I was like don't
forgot anyway so I'm rooting and managed
to find it tucked underneath a jacket in
my closet and I didn't really know it
was there
I've got this back out of my wardrobe
also today I am wearing absolutely
beautiful new Harmonix e passione this
is like a picture this is their brand
new perfumes to see collection as you
know I'm a massive fan of silica farm
love that one and I'm also a big fan of
the original sable this is a new seat
percy on it the thing with this one is
it's very kind of sexy it's more it's
like a very empowering sexy scent
it's got pear in there it's got
blackcurrant pink pepper it's kind of
got that very similar vibe to the usual
sea but it's I far prefer this
I mean I still love left I found because
I like amber if you like amber that
you're like left I found but this one
it's a little bit more fruity with the
pear oh it's absolutely amazing
this would be the most amazing like
Valentine's date night perfume that's
what I'm gonna wear it for are you going
to take me on a Valentine's Day we are
we are here for Valentine's Day
oh yeah what are you gonna do for it
Alex's birthday four day before
Valentine's Day
and actually our anniversary is also
Valentine's Day not because it would fan
Tynes day just because we got to do it
got together a day after I like this bit
though yeah me on a date so I can
wirelessly the idea with this with
Armani is that the red lip is the super
empowering powerful thing that people
like to wear when you want to feel their
most amazing and most sexy I know I
certainly do I mean I do is see Posse Oh
Nia it's that this is like your red lip
in a bottle super sexy or very
empowering and it's oh it's absolutely
gorgeous I might wear a red lip today
draw I'm gonna go for it I'm always
wearing my pink lip I'm gonna go with
I'm gonna go with Armani 400 which is
the perfect red lip this is like their
signature red lip free hand the texture
of these is the rejects it shines the
texture I mean look at that like shine
but not glossy over the top I love the
color of that it's not to like letterbox
red it's got a bit of cherry tones which
I personally love right that's me for
the day then I've got my red lip I've
got my seat Patsy on it on makes me feel

little minute and spoke about things and
what's been going on there's stuff thank
you so much for the amazing feedback on
my new Instagram pictures from the
Maldives
so as long as you guys love with them
that is the main thing and being
the feedback has been like phenomenal
I've had so many you guys instant
messaging me DMing me on Instagram
either sharing my profile on your insta
stories and saying like in the fro love
her new feed things like that which is
amazing I'm trying to get back to every
single one of you that's something I've
really been enjoying recently a lot of
people instant message me and I try and
get back to as many second and honestly
I've been really really enjoying getting
back to people on Instagram because the
messages are always so incredible so
complimentary really lovely a lot of
people sort of tell me about what's
going on their lives and saying that I
inspire them all that they've been it's
been inspired to create a blog or a
youtube channel or to do such thing or
buy a camera and it's literally the most
incredible thing to read ever loved just
guys remain some messages and getting
back to you guys saying hey and saying
thank you and and all that because it's
just yeah it's making my day the moment
removed something we feel really really
happy and having that one-to-one
interaction it's to spin awesome so big
big thank you to everyone that's been
sharing my pictures and showing my feed
and just being generally amazing talking
about Instagram this is why if you see
it's olive logged through the day and I
said that I'd lost some footage and one
of the things in that footage was that I
had a little chat with you guys I wanted
one like this that was about a couple of
months ago now girl months ago my
Instagram shot up by about 1213 K in one
day it was as much of a shock to me as
it might be to you
I remember I was with Amelia at the time
we were on our way to Iceland it was
literally the morning of Iceland and I
was Satna us out with her and Iommi
actually we're having coffees just about
to going at the plane not like my
Instagram was to shut up massively and
we all like gathered around the phone I
was like I don't know sand and we were
looking back through like has someone
tagged me has someone mentioned me and I
just couldn't work it out at all but my
Instagram had shot up soon as we got to
Iceland as well obviously three hours
later on a plane I didn't have an
internet service i refresh my page again
and it shot up again
so I was just yeah in major confusion I
have no idea where that group of people
came from
no idea but I know I had one or two
people message means say like I don't
understand all you got this big group of
new followers from and a few people also
said like I'm really disappointed in new
seeing as he had such a big round in the
day on Twitter about how you don't like
when people buy followers I was very
ambiguous in those tweets and I was
having a very bad day I was very ill in
Chicago and I could see someone buying
likes on Instagram and I mentioned on
Twitter and I shouldn't have done and in
the end a I apologize for that for being
so ambiguous because I think that
ambiguous tweeting is not the way
forward I think if anyone has a problem
with someone now on Twitter they should
go directly to them mr. Texan others
should direct them properly they should
not indirectly passive-aggressively 22
help them
I've learned my lesson from doing that
and that's never gonna be happening
again anyway however my chip my feelings
on people buying likes and followers has
not changed and I know that 99.9% of you
will understand and will know for a fact
I would never do that
what I mean for a few reasons let's be
honest at this point I mean I'm on
800,000 Instagram followers which is
mind-blowing why would I feel the need
to buy twelve thousand followers
randomly just one day I mean who was
that stupid that they would buy in bulk
and do you know so it's like this is
like my average growth then oh and then
down and then average both I mean come
on I'm not a stupid person and I know
that I would never be able to get away
with that by buying secondly I have a
lot of morals and principles I've spent
a lot of time growing this channel I
thought I spent a lot of time putting
hard work into it I would never try and
sabotage that now thirdly it really
vexes me when people do buy followers of
Instagram likes people getting found out
there now pieces of software that can
tell you when people bought I'm not one
of those people and I never ever will be
one of those people so just in case and
if you saw that jump in my Instagram and
wondered what the hell it was
I would also like to know - I've asked
Instagram of messages grow about it and
know someone on Instagram and I message
them and asked them and told them what
happened and they - were just
baffled and they're still going to get
back to me on it hopefully I mean it's
been it's been a little well now but
they said they're gonna have a little
look into it and see what happened but
God knows but either way anyway I just
wanted to kind of make it clear because
at the time I was paranoid thinking
people are gonna think I've bought these
and I didn't like that paranoid feeling
so just to put it to rest in cases
anyone out there who thinks that I've
done that I have absolutely not I swear
on my life I would never ever do that I
would never be dishonest
I would never fraud my way to a career I
worked too damn hard fourth career and I
would never try and sabotage that in any
way so just so you know I'm so yes
that's the second thing I had to kind of
mention I've been babbling on for too
long now probably yeah Fashion Week
fashion month is coming up and it's
gonna be a very very busy few weeks I'm
not doing Milan Fashion Week this year
because I'm going to LA that week for a
cool project that I'm working on with a
brand that I love but you guys know I
love so you'll see that very very soon

Proenza and then I'll be doing London
even that LA and then we're going to
Paris with L'Oreal as always which would
be amazing

sea gasps do you guys want to see what
kind of videos to receive I obviously
will be flocking as always but do you
also want me to do holes of the items

like talked through like what cuz what I
used to do is what I wore in Paris what
I Lauren New York can I go through each
item and then show you how I wore it in

super exciting which I haven't told you

everything about it but I can get a lot
something is coming this month that I am
extremely proud of and I have been dying
to share with all of you

excite about that it's got a laugh stuff
going on I'm working on some incredible
projects all with brands you know I love
as always I am so selective with
everything that I work on I only work
with the brands that I use that I love
that I think you guys would love and
that I would recommend to my mom and
that is that is the morals I've always
added to especially for the last few
years when I've really started to
understand me my brand what I'm doing
where I want to take this whole thing
and I've become so selective I'm so
protective of everything that I've kind
of done so far so that's why as always
which I think you guys know at this
point you can trust my honest reviews
you can trust the things that I tell you
about because I'm not going to tell you
about a load of crap
literally the amount of times that my
mom will text me and say I'm just gonna
out and bought this I saw in your vlog
she hasn't asked me she doesn't ask me
like do you definitely like this she was
girls that buys it you know so I don't
want to be giving recommendations to
people I love and all of you guys who I
love for you to go out and buy a little
crap and spend your money on it so I
only tell you about their best things
and the best brands and the brands I
love and that is the way it's always
going to be I don't have time to do
everything so I do the things that I
love and I'm very proud of so there's a
lot coming up guys there's a lot coming
up this year it's a very very exciting
year for me and I just can't wait to be
honest I can't wait anyway I'm gonna
