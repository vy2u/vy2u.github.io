I'm taking the day off
after a wonderful fashion month four and
a half five weeks of different cities
and lots of different outfits lots of
incredible events it's all been wrapped
up now with the finale at L'Oreal which
was an incredible finale so it's been
amazing I headed back on the USA last
night got home Alex agreed to watch the
Lady Gaga documentary with me again
although I'd already watched it you have
to watch it if you haven't already it's
on Netflix
it is so empowering and inspiring and my
respect for Lady Gaga have gone up like
100 notches now I mean I always really
liked like Lady Gaga quite a lot of her
songs with the soundtrack to my
university days lot of good memories
listen to her music and have I seen your
life sure I've seen alive yeah I think
I'm sorry live in Manchester yeah but
now major major is about foreign I
absolutely love that again I mean I
really love the g1 album anyway but if
you really like that album as well it
shows he kind of her making all the
different tracks and that and the trial
and tribulation she went through it's
brilliant so definitely recommend it
anyway mean I like the day uh I mean
I've been tying up my suitcase I had
massive suitcase packed so I've just
been turning that out for a while and
now I mean I was just gonna head out I'm
just gonna have no makeup I'm wearing
flat shoes I'm wearing a pair of
Converse today because I've had heels on
for the past like months and ever I've
kind of bruised the ball of my foot
so I'm in flat shoes I have no makeup on
I've got a little bit of lipstick that's
it and has now I want to get a coffee
on again after you ball we're gonna go
walk around a lovely park it's a really
nice day together we get a little star
be silently
I'm sure they wanted a pumpkin
the disability is take my estimate a
play for you
we're just in Tesco and Alex is buying
monkey nuts so we can see the skirt
so nice here called kyoto park and
lapatin park were having a walk around
and feeding the peacocks monkey nuts

Black Jacks and there's a tutti frutti
thing 104 so fruit salad it smells like

like purple and pink and light little
squares they were like tutti frutti kind
of things they were tutti fruity teas
