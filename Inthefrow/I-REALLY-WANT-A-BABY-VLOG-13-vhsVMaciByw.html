don't want to don't want to also that
was the most bizarre flight you know I
was m6 China Eastern Airlines have never
flown before
but you weren't allowed to use your
phone
on the plane but that meant that twelve
hours I really wanted to edit pictures
and get them ready so our instagrams on
it to listen to my music I'm to do my
email twelve hours out of my day when I
could be working and literally three
times I got told off because the first
time effects on airplane mode wasn't
result issue is and then she said
something I didn't quite understand us
for carried on and some at Kimmel that
makes you have to put phone
got any phone off what are you talking
about and then I kind of put it down
then for caviar listening to music and
the came over again like me turn off
your phone like let me use it comments
of time here anyway also but I did watch
beating the beast on the plane and
literally like have a smile on my face
in Thai way I cried so many bits just
remembering like the good memories like
that like what my favorite Disney films
teaching the bees and big fan of that so
it was absolutely brilliant it was quite
cheesy in some bit and quite cliche but
