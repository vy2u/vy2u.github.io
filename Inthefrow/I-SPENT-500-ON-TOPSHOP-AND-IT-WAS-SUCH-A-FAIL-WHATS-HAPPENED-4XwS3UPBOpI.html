hall okay
bit of a backstory with this one if and
if you guys follow me on Twitter I
mentioned you the day that I was on a
fashion website and I was trying to buy
some new pieces and I was struggling big
time I realized I'm not doing a Topshop
haul in so long I'm gonna do a lot of a
sauce but I'm not gonna Topshop in ages
so I wanted to do at Topshop Paul went
online and it was so difficult I just
couldn't find anything I loved or that I
could see myself wearing I almost felt
like am I too old for Topshop now like
what's happened I just still maybe it's
just this season sometimes it comes and
goes in waves with every brand and one
season you love everything in the next
season I'm not that keen so maybe that's
just it for me but in a way because I
found it so challenging I almost wanted
to challenge myself to find the best of
the bunch and what I thought was
actually really really good at the
moment at Topshop there is like a pink
suit that I really really want and it's
out of stock and I can't get my hands on
it and that's annoying me so I would
have loved to have got that but I'll
leave a link for that you can get it
from Nordstrom but I'm like do I really
want to get from Nordstrom when I should
just feel to get it from Topshop it's
gonna cost me customs anyway that's a
whole other story so instead I'm gonna
show you what I got from Topshop I did
order 13 things only I think nine of
them were in stock in the end like I
don't know what happened so I'm gonna go
through why hold why I found and what
you guys might love this season two and
I'll try them all under for you as well
ok it came I these monstrous bags from
Topshop and I haven't open it since I
got it like a week and a half ago I want
it to be a bit of a surprise for the
purpose I'm just gonna dig straight into
the pile
right first thing I found which is
extremely extremely creased right now
okay I found this jumpsuit I just
thought this would be cool layered over
a very nice knit so a little bit big net
with a real neck this over the top with
a kind of a bit of a dungaree feel to it
it's collapse at the very bottom it's
extremely crease so that's not great and
then on the back ah these laced times
I'm not overly keen on lifestyles like
this I'll be honest and I don't think
they lock overly expensive in my opinion
but it could look kind of nice over
Nikhil so the different bits of the the
neck coming through the back yes this is
the first piece I've tried it on with
you I think alone this would be not only
a bit boring and basic but also
extremely showing so it definitely is
meant to be layered I actually love it
with this color with this a peachy nude
top works really really well again
though it feels too big for me I don't
know if the worst six is available but
I've definitely need the sex in this so
I think I will actually look online try
got four really like it I mean it needs
a really good really good iron but I
like the overall style with Hales it's
really sweet it just it's almost easy
layering pieces here got a blue that's
knit that you love to wear so I really
like it I see the smaller size okay this
is another jumpsuit because I'm a bit of
a jumpsuit lover it's brushed on it
comes loose in the winter this jumpsuit
is polka dots
and goes down again it's kind of it kind
of looks a bit co-op style but I don't
think it is I think it's a bit longer
than that but it's definitely wide leg
it's just quite cute these thrills along
each strap and it comes out into open
shoulder and sleeves into mini sleeves
the fabric doesn't feel overly
incredible I'll be honest this is 49
pounds and again it could look quite
nice layered over a white piece of
knitwear actually with the right in this
we'll see what we think I think I'm
gonna eat my words of this one cuz
actually really liked it it's really
really sweet I like the length of the
trousers the pattern overall probably it
comes together at the waist you can
cinch in and make a more flattering
silhouette overall think these arms
adorable the only thing I'm worried
about is that these a little long and
will keep falling down but I think
overall it's not going to bother me too
much
I've just heard there was a little pair
of red heels which I think works really
well and a little red back again will
look gorgeous
okay I think so sorry you're just didn't
mean to do these back-to-back okay this
I think I remember really liking this
one this again it's a wide leg jumpsuit
it kind of reminded me of three-floor me
it's a qaq you meet self-portrait vibes
this feels like me the knife quality
fabric actually appear the smash seems
really thick and quite robust one of my
favorite words ever again mesh sleeves
that go down here it's got some frills
over the bust
it's higher neck hotels and then it goes
down into quite a while quite like it's
really hard to show this gonna think but
I think that's quite me actually and
it's in more of a deep blue than a black
I think
do you know what I think it's black I
think that's just my eyes big massive
black I love this jumpsuit so much it's
just a little bit too big I'm sure this
is a 6 but I think I definitely would
need like the 4 if you did it someone
have a look online and see if the do X
it's a shape otherwise it fits so nice
it looks so nice on it fits generally
really really well it just need to be a
little bit tighter around the waist
especially it's a great length to the
trousers it just looks really really
nice and really nice quality I love the
mesh I love the patterning frills just
want those really easy jumpsuits to wear
I wish it fit me a little better so I'm
gonna look for the smaller size I
ordered oh yeah cuz I think I thought I
can pair this with some of the jumps
take it this is just a bit basic but you
always need these kind of Basics in your
wardrobe I feel it's just a peachy nude
high-neck sleeved top but I thought this
color could look quite nice especially
I've got a bit of a tan I could do at
the moment if you're wondering why I
look so bronze right now it's cuz I've
got a good turn on I've just had my hair
redone and it's got extensions in it
from a photo shoot I had yesterday
that's why if you wondering why I look
so talented but I thought it could look
really nice with the black jumpsuit
how aware it I think it's basic this is
tapas it's actually my favorite things
in this whole whole it's so wearable
it's very very me just very simple basic
but also quite fitted and fluttering
that is often the kind of style thing I
go for but as I said earlier I think I
can pair this with lots of different
things like layered underneath of the
knit wear underneath jumpsuit so
underneath you know more baggy to
restyle that kind of vibe well I just
wanted to show you guys with it with
jeans because I'll probably wear this a
lot like this and this whole outfit is
very very me black boots jeans and then
it's a very simple fitted roll neck it's
very very me but last year when I was
more more into the black real necks
this is a nice kind of more autumnal
edition I think so I love this a lot
this is definitely a keeper honestly
like I'm really really struggle doing
this for really really struggled I just
didn't find that many things absolutely
loved I found this so that I thought was
somewhat cute and quite like the Brit on
stripes of this but I just don't know if
it's overly me to wear something like
this and honestly so I just don't know
okay that's it
this is just a body as always I mean
when do I wear anything else but oh it's
not meant to be attached like that no
surely not I mean I'll see how it looks
when it's on but I would imagine that
would mean that you can't get it over
your shoulders I thought just tucked
into some jeans
he would make nice a nice basic burgundy
white body Steve oh that's out but I
like the felt a bit a lot okay so this
I'm gonna talk about this in like three
different parts so so this top love this
I'm Austan away abroad when it got small
boobs but I would probably wear this
with an underwire bra the second
strapless as well well I really like it
I don't own anything like they say so
like off shoulder let's just skinny
shoulders here really fitted and like I
said it says daydreamer on it on the
boob but I think it's really cute and I
like this so he liked it as well so yeah
it just fits really nicely
yeah like awareness a lot for God casual
days so I do really like this a lot
okay this little top again quite
self-portrait vibes it's a nude backing
with black lace work you can also these
gold rivets all over I just figured it
would be quite cute with a pair of black
trousers
or collapse or a cute little skirt maybe
isn't those lovely dresses this is like
an exclusive Topshop piece we'll see it
might not be right at all but we will we
will see with this one I've teamed the
peplum style top with the jeans and the
boots you can see it in more of an
outfit although I kind of feel like
actually more stiletto style shoes would
look better with these jeans because I
feel like they're quite a lovely ankle
length but anyway the top I also feel
like it's a little big for me actually
again this is a six now I feel like
maybe I need a four I feel like the
Topshop sizes have got a little more
generous potential it feels a little
larger on me well I think this could be
top at a lot of you guys for love it can
be team with so many different things
with miniskirts with longer skirts with
trousers jeans shorts it's just kind of
one of those very easy tops up and it
looks quite cute sophisticated in more
self portrait style it's just a little
bit too big for me unfortunately but I
do quite like it it's very pretty and
also very good for work like it's quite
work appropriate I think - I bought some
new jeans because Topshop jeans are
often some my favorites so I bought pair
of Jamie jeans they're in a really great
blue grey shade I mean like these
actually I think I really love shades so
try that for the jeans they're a perfect
perfect fit
Topshop always fits me the exact way I
want it to really nice unfitted love the
color I think this color is absolutely
gorgeous I'll link below the exact wall
I chose because as you may know Topshop
have so many different types of jeans I
don't know why there's like a thing yeah
yeah just Jamie Jesus fit quite nicely
they don't do high-waisted but they're
not also low-rise so you like these a
lot
okay so these the boots I think quite
looking forward to seeing I got a pair
of these almost like sock boots style
but these are more satin version I mean
they're obviously the quality of these
isn't going to be like your Balenciaga
style but they look like the blend sagas
and they're 800 panelist
and they are so I thought I'd give these
a go to see what they were like and also
the fabric it's gonna be a little bit
more robust than the Balenciaga so just
one thing so I was quite excited about
actually these boots I like a lot more
than I thought I would actually and the
such an affordable version of the soft I
really like them with this outfit who's
what I was wearing just but I was
filming sat down really really liked it
with it it goes with the black belt I've
also put a black belt with it but yeah
the comfortable and look cool they look
on trend I really really liked them when
I got it back and about room when I
ordered here ok I ordered a pair of
these kind of boots they're not quite
knee length they're not uncle links they
come of that in-between and they meant
to kind of ruffle down a little bit in
red suede it's a really nice light show
red suede actually and a cone like a
cone block heel
I thought these could look really cool
in fact I'm gonna try might try them on
with this dress and wearing disease
could work really well red on red and
for these red boots I love this good
about fit this is why I bought this in
the first place because the way I saw
it's on the website they'd put it with
overni red boots it's like full red like
these obviously these are the Topshop
boots I really like them I mean the
perfect length for this dress because it
just kind of gives that slit in between
you will see a little bit skin really
like the difference in color as well but
the boots they feel like I'm really good
material I feel comfortable I don't have
any boots so below the mean like this
yes actually really ladies I think I've
get a lot of wear out of these for
autumn winter and the quality of them
the fact that obviously suede they're
slightly higher price point isn't too
too bad they're like that you should
know what that is it that is that I
almost feel like I must have ordered
more than that but obviously obviously
you know I'll be honest this was such a
challenge and I can't believe that I
couldn't find more things on top shot
than this so it's a little disappointing
probably a bit of a fail in our state I
feel like a few of these things I really
like a few I really don't like so I'll
be sending quite a lot back from here
but I'd love to know what you guys think
what were your favorite pieces that I
found is there anything at Topshop that
you love right now that you think I'd
maybe love myself I'd love to know you
guys usually amazing for recommending
items to me and I still think I've ever
spent this long trying to find new items
for wardrobe so it's a little bit insane
