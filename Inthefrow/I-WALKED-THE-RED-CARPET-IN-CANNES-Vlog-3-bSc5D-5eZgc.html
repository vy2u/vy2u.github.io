long like Nicki Minaj played Diana Ross
and I managed to get really any of Diana
Ross because my phone died
Diana Ross is a full fashion show wears
like 30 different models all looks
absolutely incredible yes so just quite
an insane night like insane what back to
my room and the one thing that upset me
a bit is that the cleaners been in my
room and throw away the bag and the
hunger my dress like I haven't even -
left it on the floor like as if it was
rubbish I had literally put the hanger
back inside the bag and hung it off the
toughest shelf so it was ready for me to
put my dress back into for good
transport at home again I don't
understand why cleaners throw away a
branded plastic bag with a coat hanger
in it I was hung up like Italy and they
I'm wearing the dress anyway I'm just
going to go to bed I'm looking you in a
few houses now guys next day I
completely forgot to vlog anything for
the past few hours we checked out the
