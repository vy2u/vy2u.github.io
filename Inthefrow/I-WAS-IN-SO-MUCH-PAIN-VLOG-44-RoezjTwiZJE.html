do the blog but I wouldn't change a day
we filmed it here like a month and a
half ago with a full film crew that's
like 30 people here you wouldn't know
from look at the video it's just so it's
so streamlined and beautifully sharp but
it obviously takes a lot of people to
get that kind of quality so that was
good fun so there's that I'll leave a
link to that as well on the screen
because I'd love for you to go watch
that I'm still proud of it and I also
this is so cool I went to the Dior show

we're just upset it's our favorite sweet
treats for fatties that's that is them
we army families let's try this bad boy
together I want it to be like the other
ones but just without all of the
darkness in it it feels more they're not

but just couldn't stop grass name so
that didn't happen so we're gonna go to
these systems ax and cheese garlic bread
with oh my god
so it's been a nice jail day for me I've
been alone most of my day these guys
have been out all day going for pop
drinks and enjoying the lives and I've
been in the house but the nice day
hi guys this is Monday sorry I barely
filmed everything yesterday and today I
must definitely have an 8 2 o'clock now
at night I've literally been doing
emails the entire day from 9 a.m. until
4:15 and then I rushed out the house to
a spin class and I had an awesome spin
class over at cycle I'm Artemis Street
and I'm at my friend Charlotte there
that works for our Marnie and we have a
good little spin and a cap shot and they
came home I like he's out with his
friend Rick they've gone to like a
little Bowl somewhere so where I've just
had a shower got myself ready and that's
why I'm looking film I feel quite red in
the face from that spin class cuz it was
pretty intensive I probably might just
make myself a little Bowl or someone
else thinking maybe like an acai bowl
I'm not sure if that I'll probably wake
me up a bit I don't know but I'm really
gonna sit on my computer for the rest of
the evening I just do a few more emails
and as some like clear my inbox out Oh
God I'm just the most immense pain yeah
I went to the gym two days ago I really
really really worked myself hard so I
did three sets to everything I did and
is like twelve squats with about 25
kilograms me I know it's not massive
compared to some but it's enough for me
then I did three rounds of like 12
deadlifts at the 25 bar then I did hip
thrusts like my head over a bench and
pushing up into a hip thrust for the 25
bar loads of leg exercises like I knelt
on a bench and it allows like donkey
kicks and bat kicks and leg raises but
was they backwards all that Oldman I did
squat pulls on a cable machine so I
really really really worked myself to
the point where I walked home with them
the worst jelly legs like I literally
felt like really out of breath and like
my legs just weren't working and so
today I was really feeling it and then
I'll step into this I went to a spin
class earlier thinking that it maybe it
would run off a bit the lactic acid
buildup in my legs and it's not it's
just added to it so I actually feel like
I have a light in my legs not theirs
they're so heavy
they're super tiny even I've given was
like Jesus like some muscles are
so slow and they're about to pop out
your skin it's like just picking them up
it's just how much I realize in the
scheme of life this is not
the pain most painful thing ever because
of that um it's made me really tired and
like really like you can't rest myself
so I'm just gonna try and fall asleep
and get some sleep
I've got a full day tomorrow starting
with a meeting at 9:15 so better get to
bed and up early so good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
