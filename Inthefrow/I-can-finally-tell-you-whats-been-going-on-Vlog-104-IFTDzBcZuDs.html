I'm just so tired okay I just been
sleeping really badly the past you know
something like not night terrors but I
like to call it my paranoid dreams where
I wake up and I'm in a psych lucid sleep
and half awake half asleep think things
are in the room but I like someone else
today yeah geez now I've got a few
things on today starting off I was very
I'm very very proud to say that I was
asked by Dior to speak today at 1:00 on
that panel
diora having an event called women in
Dior where I think there's quite a few
different women I'm wrong we have little
mini interviews to an audience so that's
what I'm doing and I'm gonna be talk
about being a blogger and how it all
works and all that kind of thing but I
just feel very very very honored really
that they asked me to do this so very
very lovely of them I've just been
getting myself ready you need to do my
hair now I'd really want a coffee
I mean a mic often I need to eat
something cuz I'm just not good at the
moment what's wrong with me I have a
Dior dress to wear again in fact it's
the same black dress I wore last week I
asked if I could borrow that one again
because I really really liked it and I
thought it'd be quite nice for today so
I'm wearing that we wear my little black
heels again I am excited about today
lots of things going on right hair done
dress on watch on I think I ready to go
now
okay so I've just finished up
I don't manage to film anything inside
because it was it was a private event
lots of really inspirational ladies who
are looking to get into work and it was
like a big I commend touring a mentoring
program for lots of graduates ladies are
currently University and just graduated
list about five Powerman to female and
Perlman's and given their new skills and
ideas and inspiration and motivation so
to have been asked to go along to speak
and to offer my own insights about what
I've done and the business everything
was really really absolutely amazing I
feel very honored to impart that so
absolutely wonderful I've had a
wonderful morning and ladies treat you
much the most gorgeous bouquet of
flowers and a little treat as well so so

lovely coffee ketchup and I also changed
as well because the gorgeous dress I was
wearing if not if not see-through but
