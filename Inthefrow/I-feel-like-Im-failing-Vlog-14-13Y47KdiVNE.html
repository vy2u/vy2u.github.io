you can Alexes notice that I'm not like
viewing myself technologist I'm sure it
is I think understand things have
recently got really really busy and lots
of exciting projects coming up so it's
not but it's in my head interesting to
date someone I'm going to fit things in
and what I'm going to manage to do my
other work and see friends that's have
some downtime and it kind of gets about
on top of me knows can you to kind of
compartmentalize everything and realize
that everything will have it set time
and it'll be okay but sometimes I said
it can stress me out a little bit too
much I'm also kind of feel like feel
worried about these vlogs in terms of
like the content I'm soaking that you
guys actually enjoy in them before eing
so I kind of feel like I'm failing with
them a little bit like this is what I
reasons why else worry about sites
logging in the first place is that a lot
the time I'm in the house
or going out to meetings and a lot of
things I can't film or it's not
appropriate to film and therefore it's a
lot of like in the car out car back and
a house start in the house I'm back in
the house again you not seeing your
leave it worries me a bit bored of it so
it's kind of yeah I feel like I was
feeling a little bit the whole vlogging
thing I mean maybe it's just come out of
really like bad day I don't know but I
really want to go the gym well I want to
go the gym but I really cannot be
bothered and so when I lie down and now
not do anything and not think about work
but just so much we need to do I need to
film a video tonight I think as well yes
I'm complaining they're moaning
sensually nothing I just feel very low
today really low as you guys lay down
quite a bubbling up deep person and
quite happy like a lot of time most
people know me as Ben person is quite
loud and Clary quite animated which I am
1995 seven time but it also times when I
do get very tired and also want to have
a bit of down time but then it's
hardware see people and I'm in that mood
because then they think I'm upset I'm
not technically upset or down I just I'm
just a bit more tired or exhausted or
I'm not quite as enthusiastic that day
is week that's just it
sometimes so generally I have to because
like on all times so then when I get
home and without sometimes a bit like
dozen else get like this I'm sure I have
a lot of other people like this as well
it's happening twitch on like the
outdoor mode and then when they get home
and I can completely different mode
because we just need tightened by
themselves and there's you so much
energy that it just kind of gets to them
I'm sure barely you know thing abit
tired and this bit tired and yeah just
need to get my diary now to work out
what I'm gonna do everything and then
