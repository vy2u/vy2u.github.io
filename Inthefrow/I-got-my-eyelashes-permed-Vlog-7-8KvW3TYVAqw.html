been filming this big-ass hole right
here so we've seen it already if not
I'll leave it linked on the screen it's
like a massive of hash to hole probably
my favorite I know I own say this but
probably my favorite ever hole I've done
everything I'm so obsessed with and it's
just my wardrobe so summer is transform
that to say that I'm wearing my vb shirt
absolutely scoffs so Cantley always
course amazing it's a little bit warm
for a moment because London is hot head
head head in the moment this is kind of
my film ketchup and I've got my
dominates and my camera and my bed I'm
definitely ring any pants you come to
learn this from these vlogs that mean I
just generally don't wear either sure
top and another kind of stuff day today
just with them everything happened
yesterday with my granddad so I spoke
with my mom earlier but another good cry
on the phone and she said that the
family are all heading around there
later for a meal and future than is the
kind of be with each other and I had
this video to film so I thought that was
taught me to go home up too much work to
do but I was like you know what if I can
just get this film quickly I can head
home and surprise my mom so that's what
I'm doing so I've literally thrown on my
face Alex have helped me kind of set up
quickly film this really quickly it's
going to film some cutaways and I'm
going to get myself all Association get
myself back to Wigan as soon as possible
just we're going to see the family be
with a family that's the plan for today
few hours down and we are doing I've got
all my legs doing how to trying like 15
different outfits if you knots not video
already I'll leave it linked on the
screen so I really hope that you like it
and really really enjoy doing that but
now it's bit the rush gotta go I got a
book a train first and I'm going to get
to Houston and get Turing home oh my
backpack got my swiss little Chanel
taking this looks unlike the other
little bits back is actually need and
I'll be back tomorrow so I'm not in red
lobby notice obviously so I will see you
when I put my camera back up tomorrow so
it's almost like 24 hours later pretty
much now I got myself back from my mom's
we're going to head to the gym quickly
I've been out there friends later on my
oldest friends now she went to my
primary school so I've known as since we
were like
i meeting up with her going out for some
food better than ice time at home just
see her on trial comfort my mom and if
anything she was more comforting me to
be honest it's a sort of hard and
yourself start to learn more more
details that what happened and the
moments that run up to it is quite I
feel a bit haunted to be honest haunted
as the best word up in use and Florent
find a bit hard to deal with your honest
on camera obviously I'm I'm okay but
yeah I feel very very teary and very
upset quite a lot really so I think that
getting out will do me good just take my
mind off it and speaking with friends
it's also been a really crap day in
London again with these new attacks that
just happened I must feel very numb at
the moment with everything else is
happening to me personally but it's
really hard to deal with anything else
and it's just it's a step skating all
over again like couple weeks ago anyway
we're going to go see Jim quickly and
then go into the Alfred's back from the
gym already showered into my new top
love this answer the quality this is so
beautiful if you already see my hole I
recently actually Hollywood seen this
and me going on about the quality of the
main M tops but honestly I'm not have a
shirt so beautiful it's almost a linen
cotton beautiful I've got my new All
Saints gene from so I was very cash
world of seeing some old friends going
to zzs just easy like easy food easy
wine you notice our she'll just have to
last you date events
I just need it's a bit of a chill out a
good loss before home to be honest I
didn't have the best impression ever
because my headphones died I have the
beat in ear wireless headphones on the
click run your ears don't get them if
you think about getting them for they
are rubbish the battery is so bad I'm
also going to have them like five months
and now it's got the point where I plug
them in take them out and the batteries
already gone so don't bother with those
new amount of makeup on firmly some done
up a lot of you guys are really enjoying
my hair thanks and I'm quite enjoying my
hair this one
but don't think I'm gonna be cutting it
only because right now I have to head
girls if I want to herself I can help on
her cell so it's quite good what if I
cut it and I've kind of lost that
ability it would be shame like time to
go hey guys Monday morning so sorry that
my film is last night it was just you
know seeing friends like good friends it
wasn't really an appropriate time to
film anything you know what it's like
but we had a really really good night
really good time today we're a little
bit earlier than usual actually have
things to do today which is fun
I'm going it my lashes done with so if
you know me quite well you will know
that I'm a big fan the lvl lashes new
brushes and it's like a lush lift and
it's almost like a perm for the
eyelashes like it literally to them so
for me if you look at my lashes now it's
a very good way of like showing you
before and after you can kind of see it
here when my lashes fill it should just
stick down a bit and forward I think
it's just have got very straight hair I
love getting the LVL because it means
that it's completely natural it's not
fake it's just that your eyelashes are
up which means I can wear not ordinary
mascara and it lasts like six weeks as
well so I totally love it and because I
love those guys so much I've raved about
them so much just like organically and
naturally they want to work with me to
do like a really cool comprehensive blog
post about the treatment about what you
guys can expect how it goes on like what
because some people are probably bit
worried cause it's near the eyes and
they're worried about having people
touching their eyes for that first 45
minutes
honestly it's absolutely fine I usually
fall asleep and then by the end of a
I've got incredible eyelashes so I'm
working with those guys to create this
blog post so me a night job right now
I'm going to go over to a hotel to get
Martians done Alexa's gonna take those
pictures I'll be on in the fro calm
