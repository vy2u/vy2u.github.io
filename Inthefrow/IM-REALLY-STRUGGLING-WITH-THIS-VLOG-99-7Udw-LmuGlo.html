always done always something going on
always a trip to go hard always busy I
like to keep with me but yeah it can't
fell impossible again very very excited
to be about care thickness my third or
fourth time can with L'Oreal I've been
here we don't know I don't know maybe
not mainly with L'Oreal my L'Oreal
family so nice to see those guys when we
get there after see Neelam at the
airport so I am just so excited about
this I also have two dresses with me one
from self-portrait that I haven't yet
worn and I bought like four months ago
it since at my wardrobe and I felt so
sad for ex it's such a beautiful dress
it's never got war and so brought or I
have that beautiful red Jenny Packham
dress that I had last year that I walk
to them far garlic if you guys like OD
watches you'll know that I had it got
shorter I mean I know ridiculous cutting
up the beautiful luxury dress but it was
so long it was really difficult to wear
it's beautiful but it's very hard to
work so I had it cut into like a
ballerina start like just to the ankle
so I really want to wear it again and
it's such incredible dress and either
saw it's such a nice idea to recycle
this dress for a huge event and I
thought it's a really nice thing to do
rather buy a brand new dress so I think
I might wear that that we super special
I've got some incredible Swarovski
crystal shoes to wear from Gina shoes
all three bags so I think
I'm gonna go for and obviously my hair
and makeup I'll be done by l'oréal it's
always the glam squad so really really
excited we're on our way now to the
Martinez hotel we're here it's not very
sunny though what a shame

the l'oreal glam squad

I should wear and you guys said I should
wear this one so I wore this last year
to be on far gala it's a lot longer a
lot poor fear I had it cooked by an
amazing dress makers and they cut it up

Campbell fashion relief show so I'm
gonna then change into the other dress
which is a blue dress so actually I get
to wear both but I thought this one is a
bit more red carpet super glam and then

what to expect I just know that we may
be eating about 10 so oh I was gonna put
a snack in my bag enough for the one I

to literally just in mother dream so I'm
going to get Alex like tidy up
I can copy Richard which and erikson at
the time it was very sore was
I don't want spinning nor Floria because
I worth it reflecting the whole concept
of self-worth when I spent my life too
many years thinking I wasn't worth it
and so you know I was just beginning to
think maybe I was worth it when I was
hired by l'oréal to say and
so she done these are amazing
Fabiana is literally a dream
this
they brought like selection of fingers
to try
to lady and very just time to come to
the senior
morning guys
we're back from can and today is it's
gonna be able to catch the day I think
because I haven't actually done a lot
well apart from obviously the work I've
been doing a lot stopping away and all
the pictures and the blog posts I've
been capturing etc etc I haven't
actually dawn I managed to get any blog
posts written I've not managed to do
many of my emails and I also didn't do a
video on Sunday which I felt bad about
but I just I literally where is it I
literally had no time so today I first
of all I'll use by the way I usually do
this with my hands but I'm quite not so
discovered it on today yeah I've got two
meetings today both quite spread apart
so I may potentially try and fit in a
backhaul session and go and do a little
bow if not I might wait until after my
second meeting and then go to the gym I
think definitely need to go to the gym
yesterday and can as you may have seen I
ate the biggest biggest bowl truffle
pasta and it's coated in parmesan and I
just didn't like when we're at home I
don't have any dairy at all and have any
cheese I don't have any milk or cream as
much that can help anyway and then when
I'm away all kind of goes to pot and I
found it so difficult like I have this
real struggle a real struggle with food
to be completely honest I have major
major cravings I know some days I am in
such a good place and I'm like I don't
need that and I'm not gonna eat that and
I'm really really good there unlike
other times when I think it completely
goes out the window and I'm like no why
should I can I not have this nice I
should be able to have this this cake or
this burrata and tomatoes and basil and
all that good stuff and then literally
an hour later I feel rubbish about
myself I feel physically rubbish my
stomach's excite what is this
and then mentally I also feel like I've
just taken 15 steps back but it's like I
have this devil on my shoulder whenever
food comes out or whatever there's a
menu and it's almost like I have this
devil on my shoulder it's like no do it
you could absolutely do it it can
overrides every other thought process in
my mind and then I can't think straight
and I just go yeah sorta I'm gonna have
the bad food and I'm the I'm really need
to stop because I if I'm feeling so bad
laughter it's not worth it but at the
time and the menus there I'm thinking oh
well this varietal taste so delicious
it'll be so totally worth it it's not
worth it afterwards I feel rubbish and
it's like I just forget now every single
time and I'm really trying well I'm just
very much struggling with it I can't eat
anymore the way I used to eat it's
completely caught up on me I used to eat
anything I wanted and I would put on any
cellulite or any weight or any excess
now it's reached the point where if I
eat Gorge myself on cheese and cake and
sugar and creams then it all just go
straight to my fatty cells immediately
you guys can't see it because it's
usually covered up in areas you can't
see but I can see it so now for anyone
that's going to write in the comments oh
but you're so skinny
please don't because everyone has their
own hold ups and things that they don't
like my way this is so dirty in fact now
I've done my foundation I can tell you
something I hate as long as it's gonna
fly my hair yeah please don't because
everyone has their own hangups we
respect each other's right to feel what
they want to feel about their own bodies
no and again I can feel really body
confident that's usually times when I'm
really on it with my food and I've been
working out loads and I feel amazing
those returns when you often will see me
in a bikini and because I'm really
trying but there are other times when
when I just don't want to get my stomach
out or my thighs that's just nothing
it's just a genetic thing for me and the
women in my family I think everyone's
everyone's very different some people
put on weight on my boobs
other people put weight on their arms
and their chests I don't I put my weight
elsewhere anyway so I've been feeling a
little down about myself past few weeks
I think it all spurred from my India
trip to guys because we ate like kings
on that trip it was absolutely insane
the whole trip but I was eating because
of the hospitality there and how
wonderful they are we were having like
seven course dinners every single day
and
just spots it was delicious food it was
just too much and then it just I just
thought I could just piled it on I'm not
powered on I just felt like I've added a
lot more excess to myself that I didn't
need I just don't feel healthy anymore I
don't feel my energy levels are lower so
I just want to get back to feeling
really good about myself feeling healthy
eating really well not slipping off and
be like oh I'll have this one little
cheat or I have the spoonful of this
rule about because it doesn't work does
not work if you want to be a certain
size
look a certain way I think it really
does take well diet is the main thing I
think it just takes some real like
self-control I think I mean I've got a
few friends and my mum as well struggled
with way and they've all recently taken
real control of how they feel and who
they want to be in Hollywood a lot and
they all look and feel fantastic and
that's the main thing whatever weight or
whatever size you are that makes you
feel good who cares what anyone else
thinks
currently I'm committing great sorry a
great weight all that I feel happy in
that I just want to feel toned and I
want to feel strong and I want to feel
good about myself so I'm gonna put in
some things into motion from now on I
think let me know in the comments if any
of you guys the same in there
you lead quite a healthy lifestyle now
that you're pretty good with holding
back from being too over-the-top with
what you're eating and obviously not
allowing too much ridiculous cakes and
we've got to stop it your life
and you're pretty good with that in you
have your little treat days and you're
happy treats but you're not over-the-top
with that let me know if you also
struggle with this whole thing of trying
to be good but then this little devils
on your shoulder they might know half
half the 25 pound they're after it's
gonna be great okay it'll be fine until
an hour later when you feel rubbish let
me know if I'm on my own here so no back
to the point I need to go to the gym
today does not feel it such as more
mentally for me just so I feel like I've
at least tried to do something else
anyway get myself ready I thought I'd
not turn a little sit down get ready in
the vlogs with you guys for a little
while and I
going on in 15 minutes so I'm just
getting myself together a little bit so
still enjoying this minimal make-up and
not got any foundational and just
wearing concealer beauty blowout a
beauty Blair eye contour so her eyes as
I always do I'm gonna do my brows fill
my brows a tiny bit some wine and some
lip it would be good to go then honestly
since cutting back my makeup routine
down time and get ready but I like half
easily can take me 15 to 20 minutes now
to get ready in the morning which is so
nice nice and fast my skin feels better
I haven't been breaking out the same and
if I do they go a lot quicker and they
usually anyway right when I Karen
getting ready and okay ready so this is
my pretty much everyday makeup look
again I think you've just seen this so
so often how your belly okay yeah we've
seen this scene it's a lot but um yeah
it's just not that many products now so
it's the Vita Liberata Beauty blow all
over nice soft mouth creamy concealer
benefit feel prefer our for the brows
I've got my eyelashes on either lashes
thought I'd need to do them then I've
got my tongue floor contort
unfortunately my palette here and then
it's my contour benefit hoola light not
Tilbury first love blush charlotte
tilbury highlight magic light wand and
then the lips as always it's my Rimmel
cappuccino I meant this today oh yeah
Rin my cappuccino events Manila mare lip
balm and then just over the middle and
just Pat it in I use the Laura Mercier
respect to the very thought of light
like nude and that's it that is
literally it like super quick I'm really
really enjoying this and I'm also
enjoying this hair how did you get this
I wish I could do so I'm gonna start
doing some practicing because I think
what be the stylists did when he was
doing it was instead of wrapping out
like I would do he kind of get piece and
he'd go in with the wand and then out
with the wand and then in and he's we
made each curl himself with the wand
which is why they all look on
uniform looks more grungy and it looks
more yeah just like this and it would
just take ages so I think for someone
else to do this but I'm going to try it
and see if I can get it looking like
this and then I'll show you guys if I'm
like master ok back from a meeting and
I've decided that I'm not going to be
able to do any work today if what is
left looking like this so I'm going to
put on personal loans new album quite
nice and loud not too loud so no upset
the neighbors but nice and loud and I'm
going to blitz this apartment so that it
looks nice and tight again because I
cannot work well ok the job looking
pretty good kitchens are clean now got
to here yet slightly got to here oh I'm
at alt literally got sweat on because
I've just been like blasting through it
