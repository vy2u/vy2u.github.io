day today I'm at the Virgin Atlantic HQ
called the base and we're doing some
very cool things today I can't really
tell you to sort it is there's going to
be a big announcement I'm sure the next
few weeks so hangin I say doing some
things so how to be ambiguous questions
yeah but we'll talk about that really
really very exciting though check this
out there's like markup check-in desks
in here and there's this little slit I
want to go sit in there in a minute of
the cabin and the whole plane like a
mock-up planes are very very cool in
here can't see much it's good to be
ambiguous base cement like you being a
big us apparently we've got the
opportunity to try on a real virgin SS
outfit I'm pretty excited about it
when else you're going to ever be able
to try on an SS outfit unless I change
careers on the Alex little mini skirt as
well very nice and these are all
designed by verbs there as you can I
actually got this row now because if you
go through the you oh wow so that would
be in manual in that says came out yeah
it's very like military-inspired isn't
it
everybody loved that one God you bigger
could not look like ah look ah it really
says I wish you know get on your China
this is where the most very nice but my
mom has a thing for pilot for some
reason I'm sorry I don't know why maybe
go so your jacket and jacket says
it's often benefit in stir the pot you
do I love it look how flattering this is
not the pattern that was generalized
original architecture but it is our
place that you could commit we're back
home now we're going to have avocado on
cokes with crab pine nuts and tomatoes
so I'm just going to go get those in a
little bit and then we're going to watch
the final episode of Breaking Bad so we
got a half an episode of the excess half
a breaking ball we've already seen it
while so but we've gone all the way
through the series for the second time
and so pretty much that's how nice oh we
might also play that one cook one it got
uncooked
over no cooks Alex found this cool
little game called overcooked on the
Xbox where you pretend to be shared yeah
because I play games and she won't play
any video games with me so I found this
gaming you like I don't really want to
play now you know I found this game you
like tonight were playing over coach but
yes so there's any the burgers very
little burger been in the packet money
so early I get up here
you've not have to get over your I've
had to get up to get your parcels rub it
in we're about to go to the gym this
morning I've just been going through
emails I've been in a bit of panic
because I've got kin on Wednesday and by
yesterday haven't gotten if my dress is
sorted and I've got canceled festival I
have the Loreal party and I have the
unfair got to go to which is amazing and
that's three dresses so by this morning
I still don't have any dresses I don't
know what to get them from so this
morning I've just been working out and
finding dresses and sometimes doubts I
think it's okay so now I can go to the
gym and enjoy the gym for it but I'm a
bit of a kind of health kick recently
when we're in queue but I managed to go
three times which I thought was pretty
good I never usually go to hotel gyms
because I'm all too tired and wanting to
chill out of too busy working and I
start to really prioritize it so yeah I
feel like I've got my head in the game
as in like five six times
we got back have really been on it so I
want to keep that momentum up and going
some it's really making me feel amazing
so if any of you guys like only want to
work out I've got a lot of problem areas
cellulite all of that it was really
going to get yourself this is my frame
where you realize only you can sort this
out and if in six months you want to
feel absolutely amazing and to start now
and push yourself and just do an hour a
day or an hour three days a week
and it will make the biggest change I've
already seen big changes already for me
I don't know I just feel a lot more soft
toned already and it's a lot more
healthy so when yeah I'm pretty excited
about it so we're going to go gym and
I'll see you after Angela back from the
June horrible a few times and you and
drinking beer for the past three or four
weeks I mean we're not going even badly
but it's just know I've been eating
really well you've been more healthier
than me I'm trying to be I'm trying to
go I'm just trying to like cut back a
lot and gets it again
let me guys not fun apart from do a lot
of work realism we've ever born on fire
I'm afraid the gift huh little package
come through from Burberry they sent
this cool little like notepads that
filled with lots of different color
swatches and the idea is that they just
brought out this gorgeous DK eight eight
back and they're giving me the amazing
opportunity to design my own bag you
know my uncle is so I think she's gonna
go for
I should have pink top handle it and
strap and then this metallic Mauritius
color which I think looks really nice
I was really loved Coralie tones with
deep kind of teary greens so I thought
that could look really really cute if
not the rough some really lovely I mean
look at all these different color
combination you could have it's such an
amazing idea
oh I really like that still not showered
I'm going to go shower now from the gym
I am gross so let work commence
today it's actually pretty late now
so I'm not really made the most of the
day which really knows where when that
happens I'm going to work on some blog
post now I think I've got quite a lot
but I need to put together some going to
do that yeah so how about actually have
actually mentioned what this is about I
haven't really okay so I decided to
start weekly flogging so that's kind of
like my big big news I haven't vlogged
in a while I don't know I kind of missed
it and I thought maybe it'd be nice way
to kind of chat with you guys a little
bit more by the way I'm sorry that
pretty much this entire vlog I don't
have any makeup on so sorry about that
but I don't generally wear makeup when
I'm in the house I thought I'd try
weekly vlogging and see what you guys
thought about it sort of show you
exactly what I do when I'm chilling or
what I do when I'm away or you know why
do on a Friday afternoon
yes that's my big news let me know let
me know down the comments if you like
this idea and if you want to see more
vlogs let me know have a great I was
never really like procrastinating day to
day one of those days where you are
looked at your own work and you start to
compare yourself and I always try not to
compare myself and say it's inspiration
and I do but around those counting like
oh maybe I could be doing more and what
such a boys doing at school and blah
blah so I think is always good and quite
healthy to kind of be more inspired and
try and achieve more and I'm still a bit
gutted because last week I was invited
to go backstage as a barman and L'Oreal
shoe which was going on and it had been
organised like a couple of weeks as it
turned out in the end
some timings changed and also I got back
some kubera a little bit late and when I
landed I was also a little bit ill I had
like really bad travel sickness so in
the end I couldn't make it over to Paris
for shoot which is such a massive shame
and I'm still annoyed at myself for
being kind of like ill for that these
things happen but I'm still really good
fix or miss out such a cool experience I
mean luckily I said Gloria I managed to
get someone to come in and like fill my
spot for that but generally I just go to
that I couldn't go and be there but at
least Amanda can which would be super
good for and also amfAR with my L'Oreal
family so at least I get to see them all
then which is great but sometimes you
win some sometimes you leave some
sometimes you miss out but then there
are other triumphs in you to do some
amazing things and that is
main thing it's just all about putting
things into perspective and realize how
amazing things actually are and then now
I am going to do my work because I feel
good again
Alex just cut a tree look how green it
is so what did you put in here babe peas
broccoli leek onion garlic yumminess
thank you and let the fun begin
although again I got home okay so it's
the next day the camera completely died

been working on a brand new blog post on
