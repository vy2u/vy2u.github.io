little bit like crappy today really
really did not sell to that but as
always I'm so glad I went but every time
that I don't want to go I wanna go I
always feel good like it people would
say you never ever regret a gym session
I'm actually had like a personal best
today I'm really kind of pushed myself I
went on Smith machine doing my squats
and I went to 20 kilograms and usually
always stick at 15 and play it safe but
I push myself and I went to 20 and
literally my legs felt about to explode
when I left the tune something that's a
good guide and I think I'm gonna be sore
tomorrow but I'd rather be saw the not
feeling like I've done quiner so I just
knit in Sainsbury's got some bits of me
I like I want to make a ring is kind of
fresh healthy meal and a bit of a
concoction really mix them just go back
in a QH and then it's a nice steamed
broccoli it with some almonds some
flaked almonds and sometimes on top with
some chilies all of that both cucumber
since Martin Smith written for them some
raw mushroom there's not actually any
carbs in this I could potentially do
some sweet potatoes but I've done some
feeling it's guys might just leave the
carbs out of it and do this also look
how beautiful these are Ali's got me the
other day come out absolutely beautiful
are very his heyday ah I am so tired I
am
masking today I have a massive amount
different mask and I thought I'd try
this one from Dior the hydrolyzed pause
way pink clay mask and it's trying to
very loose and drying down quite tame I
try and give mallya bask in a moment a
bit of a helping hand to be honest
my lord I aren't any emotional wreck
today I was in the bathroom we night for
talking and our burst out laughing
hysterically which turned into me this
now in like six of Tears I'm just so low
with life I'm going to go sleep and just
get rid of this day and start fresh
tomorrow
good morning today is Friday another
week
I like this automated courage what a
cutie pie
and they also made me a coffee because I
did file an espresso yesterday so we're
back on like the super tasty coffee
again I've just posted a blog post
actually I just posted and it's posted
this about dodging Habana beauty it's a
really beautiful collection which was
actually for spring and really old here
spring summer but I really loved it
amount of defeat to it because these
products are kind of like all the time
they always have them because that these
are particular shades which you can't
really now get unless you go into
Harrods or Nordstrom 3 they want to talk
about doctoring Gabbana beauty so go
have a peek at that if you'd like to see
some more Inspiron that I mean all that
just follow my blog because I do feel
like I'm primarily a fashion beauty
blogger that's where I started and it's
so interesting actually whenever I speak
to different people you say oh I thought
you're more of a youtuber and sometimes
like oh I thought you're Marvin
Instagrammer and as I take more of lager
and it's like really I it's less
interesting obviously what it shows me
that whatever and point across I suppose
is giving them a certain perception so
maybe I need to change that because I do
want to be seen as a blogger first and
foremost that makes YouTube videos and
does everything else that's as big of
absolutely love my blog and I would
never want to give up my blog I'm really
in a little bit so in the moment I'm
really going to try my best in the blog
to write three times a week if you want
to read the blog post usually it'll be
Monday Wednesday Friday and then videos
are to 2:30 someday unless something
happens that I have to interrupt that
schedule but that's the usual schedule
to say no and I don't think I've
mentioned as well my newsletter is now
live on the site if you've gone to in
the fro con for the first time think
your brand news
in the fro comm it should pop up a
little pop-up that says sign up to my
newsletter all you have to do is put in
your email address
I'm not going to spam you you literally
get one email per week on Wednesday and
that email will just have a little
rundown as my latest blog posts the
instagrams within my latest videos and
also be like a little lost list of like
my three favorite things recently in the
stores you might potentially love and a
bit little blurb for me to suspect hello
as well and it's as much like a tiny
compact email nothing too much image you
can delete it if you don't want to read
it that day I can save it for the next
day whatever you want to do this is it's
not that much it's literally one email a
week so don't worry it's something a big
spam thing it just means if you forget
to look at a blog and you really do like
me to my blog or you like my videos and
you don't wanna miss any it's just a
nice way to kind of have them straight
into email INBOX and then you'll know
but if you go on to the site so savings
odds in the fro it doesn't pop up here
then I have to do is go to the very
bottom of the page just above where main
for gum is it's click on this here just
says let me suppose ranked my weekly
email so you can just click that click
that and then this will pop up so can
you email and you are then signed up so
