as you know I've now moved to London so
I want to show you all the way around
the flax loaves your gadget Wester to
see this so thank you so much for going
by gonna start off with the hallway me
and my boyfriend are massively into
music as you probably know so we do like
to collect posters and prints first off
I'm a huge gas lance fan so I have their
sign everywhere handwritten poster for
camera in Albert I'm also a huge Rey

prints for all of his shows past few
years and an Alec has really interesting
part we've got those on the walls as
well they're coming up
so in here's my office but I'll show you
that in a minute so call in to the main
living space
this is my big open kitchen space really
really like this space everything I
could possibly need is in this kitchen
my favorite thing this kitchen is
probably my mug collection I collect
these Starbucks marks from different
states so when I was in Florida last
week you might see my blog I got this
one
but North Carolina this is one of my
favorite ones this is from Boston and
clip though so it was about 12 toes not
that I'll ever use them but a little
peek in fridge see what we have okay so

not and mean answer on a massive health
character moment so we've got fruit and
more fruit raspberry strawberry got
papaya mango kale carrots asparagus
leeks you know you name it we've got it
it is for ageism Christmas I also got
Alex this espresso machine and we have
so many of these for the poor to get
through so my favorite is definitely
being the vanilla one

evenings actually usually uses this one
for playing on this PlayStation 4 has
got Omni Mickey's again you might see
man a little Florida vlog we love these

like a little friends that we sit read
got some pretty cool coffee table walk
so the other day I was in rankin studio
which was a massive honor and I got to
shoot with him for a new collection for
very exclusive which was incredible and
then he gave us these books to come home
with and I just didn't realize just how
many famous faces he's actually shot
with so I feel very very privileged that
I got to shoot with such a cool guy also
this is where Alex works
alex is a motion graphic designer so he
needs loads of space to do his work
every day this is where he works from
and through into the bathroom
perfect smart space really I wish the
water bath it's the only downside would
you have a pretty lovely shower another
thing I really love is this area here

clothing on this rail and on this rail

brand-new beautiful Sophia Webster shoes
that I didn't want to keep in the box so
I get them on top of my cabinet just so
