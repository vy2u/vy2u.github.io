to be a January favorites video scenes
it is the end of January already in fact
it's probably February when you first
see this biggest apologies saw actually
missing a Sunday video I think it's a
first video I haven't posted the twice a
week in over a year so much apologies so
we've got me today instead most of start
go through everything that I'm really
enjoying a few weeks this was kind of
hard because I recently did to get ready
with me video and in that video I showed
so many new products and really really
loving so if you can I want to see a few
more product I really love then I'll
leave a little link on the screen
somewhere pointing to that video because
in there pretty much everything that
we're in my face is a recent favorite so
I kind of Whittle that down found some
other things I've been really loving as
well I was going to this first after
Chanel CC cream I realize this has been
out a little bit longer than I have it
but I believe its last few weeks I use
it today and I find this house more
coverage for my Everett every imagine a
CC cream whatever house this is in 30
beige and I think I probably need a 20s
comes to mix it together so the moment
this is actually quite dark sand they
and I don't quite tan so what I do like
to do with this is mix it and I mix it
with the nude machine cushion from
L'Oreal which is another favorite
foundation line this is just extremely
chewy and really glowy it's got great
medium coverage as well it's just kind
of an all around it I kind of lost
through this into my bag on most days
take it away with me but the difference
here is that the CC cream again at
Calabasas very medium coverage a little
bit more of a matte finish than a dewy
glowy finish but it has a radiance about
it and a luminosity about it that really
kind of helps your skin look really
radiant when you have this on and it
feels quite lightweight on the skin it
just got a really lovely consistency and
texture when you apply it I really
really like it but I definitely do it in
a lighter color but that's why I mix it
with in the fourth L'Oreal so I get a
little bit of each of these a little bit
more of a coverage of their for doing us
of this for glow of this irradiance up
there and that's what I'm wearing today
really really like these two together
bear trap a concealer favorite legal
multi setting concealer this I feel is
for those days when
having a really good skin day and you
just need something that's account
speckle the skin get a bit more
brightness illuminate your under eyes a
little bit more just so it looks like
they're not quite heavy and dull this is
a really great one for that so I feel
this will be really good as well finish
or skin just nothing that's really cakey
and nothing too heavy it just really
melts into the skin really really nicely
I have this inferior one just so it's
really lovely and bright underneath the
eyes but I must say if I'm having kind
of a bad day and I've got dark circles
or not slit well I'll leave something
else as well underneath this I must
admit but I think the good days and for
kind of more with your skin that don't
want as much concealer in anything
underneath the eyes this is wonderful I
really really like it this highlight I
feel I've mentioned this in a recent
favorites actually some sorry if I'm
repeating myself but I'm still warming
this is like my absolute favorite
highlight in those days the Dior nude
air and Luminizer this isn't 0:01 and
pretty sure they have maybe a couple of
different tones and their suits and more
as a rose gol de Champagne Sean do you
want a small soft gold toned but I've
mentioned it before if in fact this is
not glittery
or overly shimmery it's just kind of
this gorgeous gleaming glow I feel like
it really works into the skin a lot
nicer than a lot of the powders that I
have when it comes to highlighters it's
at imagery and natural and I'm really
over top highlights just kind of
ametrine I think it's beautiful
packaging gorgeous beautiful mirror this
is another thing I take with me
everywhere if I need a highlighter I
love it and while I'm talk about that
and Michael tell me about this brush as
well which is my outfit favorites it
comes to highlight and to see Anastacio
Beverly Hills
brush a little link down below but I
honestly find this is so brilliant
perfect shape for everywhere see it I
love it so yeah definitely Brit still
living there so much under the finish
off makeup as well I have mentioned
these before but not in the favourites I
don't think and that has to be the bare
minerals
Matt I think it's a genuine map oh these
are literally the most amazing matte
lipsticks I'd come across I went out and
bought one myself when I just haven't
defined it before I didn't really know
it even existed amazingly bare minerals
of
sent me the whole collection a little
wow that like the whole collection of
colors is insane like so anything I
bought slay first of all which is kind
of like a deep lie lucky most nude shade
this is slay so I got that when I was in
Chicago then then we all sent me all of
the colors and I was just like oh my god
these on sane so now swag so I'm wearing
swag right now which looks like this
this is a little bit more pink toned not
quite as multiliner key also insane but
then what I've been wearing at the top
is smooshed so actually my color my lips
is mainly more smooch there is insane
this is like a light mouth lilac tone
pinky but amazingness so today I've got
flag all of my lips and then coated
information and it'll kind of Ambria no
time pass it all in so those are my
three favorites and they literally
almost look identical look alas what
they're saying but I also wanted to
mention there's I think this might soon
become a favorite this is cookie and
this is more of a coral pink tone I
really hope you can see this how amazing
these are cause I'm good
so that's cookie and also this one is
cool and this is a caramel oh my god
it's amazing caramel nude can even feel
axis so moons are they for those people
who really love their more caramel kind
of news especially maybe darker skin
tones you want an incredible ombre color
Center this is your guy honestly these
are so amazing they feel really soft my
lips
the smell of that cookie dough meets
vanilla to the Centers of beautiful
absolute love it
well they're not too drying that's
drying of some matte lips I've used
before I would definitely recommend
toughen with a lip balm now and again
but overall the color I find I
absolutely adore so big big big
favorites okay some other bit some
people want to mention and these are so
good element hydrogel Anna
I watched it loose with meit on any long
haul flights I do
and I generally put them on after I
sleep or when it's about an hour to go
when the pilot says oh I'll see we kind
of going down and taking 45 minutes for
landing our part leaves it's real
literally just kind of plastic silicone
pads that just go underneath your eyes
here really cold really refreshing and I
just finally really helped wake up my
eyes a little bit you're going should
these these artisans like travel Savior
and don't like flying without these
mouths they're so good
also I don't know if you saw my evening
routine video I'll leave a link on
screen now if you didn't see that but I
went through a lot of my skincare
routine in there and I want to give a
shout out to one the products I'm really
enjoying which is a knit and fab like
colic fix night plastics to really we
are quite super strength when it comes
to acid inside this little pad but
nothing too intense I've got quite
sensitive skin anyway and they work
really well for me but anyway I was
finding that I have Millia underneath my
eyes I found out from speaking to
Caroline heroes that Millia is think
it's too kind of excess production of
keratin underneath the skin and it
creates these little white bumps so
don't pick them because they are
literally aa skin they're not something
on top of it
and it takes some time to get them to go
away and it's all about exfoliating that
area more it's just kind of like a build
up so you need to exfoliate them more
with things like toners so I went on a
binge bought laser toner so I have as
well as pixie glow tonic which you
probably all know is like the mother of
all acids also heard about these guys as
well and there are offering boos so try
them out and pretty much you get 60 of
these pads so they're super easy because
they're literally already soaked in the
product rush of cleanse
I'll juice white one of these all of my
face just as my toning routine I also
then use another toner and more
hydrating toner over the top so this
works together really really well and
I'm finding that similar million have
gone I still have one but I'm sure that
will be on its way out as well so it's
definitely working kind of having toning
in my skincare routine and these I
really really like so I kind of
recommend those as well a good couple of
fashion bits as well I want to mention
these boots guys oh my GAD so I saw
these actually recently of Selfridges
our shopping list pair of jeans and the
model was wearing these boots and I even
emailed Selfridges to ask them do you
know what these boots are on it couldn't
me at all which wasn't great but in the
end I'm not seeing them on the website
of where these weeks are from so these
are a pair of cars Malibu and the lot
could justify it the whole Balenciaga
like super liquid metal food so I had to
get them they're absolutely incredible
for Jakob else or not obviously the
price of lengthier gas got blend the
other day haven't taken them off my feet
and then walking around my house is no
my neighbors locally hates me and I
absolutely love them they're amazing so
I have to mention in the cover just a
massive favourites are closing also
these boots are in to mention these are
like the most least elegant boots I own
but probably the most kind of
utilitarian groups at i/o and fever from
Sorrell and Sorrell thus makes these
Beck's no boo so if you are from
somewhere that a lot of snow right now
or if you're going somewhere you need a
pair of like really sturdy waterproof
thick and warm boots and horses Sorrell
is kind of like your guys so pretty much
only get them now for snow boots on
going skiing and these this perfect no
subscription to the snow with them they
were just super warm super cozy faux fur
lining around the top so that's great
there's a really sturdy shoes so for any
of you guys going skiing I thought you
might like to know
and for another clothing purchase I
obviously have to mention because it's
kind of love of my life right now is
this Gucci jacket and I included this in
my recent nothing kill lookbook kind of
follow me around video again leave on
screen if you've not seen that you can
see that now me wearing this it was kind
of big investment piece that I got
myself that season with New York Fashion
Week London Milan and Paris this year
and doing all for the Fashion Week's so
I wanted a really amazing Co a critique
to all of them I absolutely love
beautiful jackets and coats I feel it's
an outside piece that you wear and
people see when they first see you so I
feel like your jacket kind of sort of
what about your visibility and it's
something that I like to invest more so
in because of that friend picking us up
from the Gucci website it arrived within
a few days yes it's wonderful I actually
got this in the size 8
I'm usually a size 6 or actually own a
size 8 it's a tiny bit bigger but
tomorrow feel the quite small to site
anyway future products so if you're like
me in your size sick I've maybe save mr.
Isaac is perfect for you if you want it
super fitted then maybe
to fix a maximum of and it has got so
many beautiful details the almost satin
ribbon around all of the edge of the
coat and on pocket and these beautiful
buttons on each sleeve and just a few of
the pieces that I'm super excited about
just because as you know I like to fill
my favorites videos now with showing to
you at the end a few newing products
that I don't quite favorite but I'm not
so super excited about using system
being these little babies from Jo Malone
so these are jo Malone from new more
travel friendly versions of the neutral
bottles or calculus versus much smaller
version the usual ones are a lot bigger
and interesting it quite a lot the time
when I went away I wouldn't take my
German line because it was so big and
also I'm scared of breaking such a big
glass bottles on all my trips with this
is so sweet
this is a 50 ml bottle and so much more
travel friendly and the most
athletically when I save it smell for
ever snouts from German ohms the dark
amber and ginger Lily
now I imagine it's probably almost
unisex as well
oh it's absolute commuters for I can't
really imagine Alex officer wearing this
as well as me but this is quite a nice
sexy date night romantic pianist and I
think it's asset beautiful oh and
another product I'm pretty excited about
is this new Tom Ford face protect SPF 50
so this is literally just like a white
cream it just goes on underneath I'm
going to pry this with my moisturizer
potentially use an over one life driver
potentially I mean you could apply it in
any way you really like as long as it's
on your skin then it's going to do its
job for those times when I'm going away
on summer holidays on you as a son I do
like to apply makeup I must admit just
because of what I do other moles on
their sasori's off snapshot or taking
pictures quite often I'll have makeup on
so it just nice to know that anything
underneath my makeup is still doing its
job while I'm still able to wear makeup
as well so it's things like this are
really great and you can't really be an
SPF 50 and this I'm really excited about
going to use I haven't used it yet but
ghulam have just launched their new
recipe of la mÃ¡scara if you saw myself
for a while you might have seen the
video I'm pretty sure it was at this
time last year where I collaborated with
gallant on there
30:12 noir collection that is launched
anyway they're just added and scary to
the range and I think it looks so
beautiful I mean how gorgeous is this so
I've talked to it so it looks like the
rest of the whole collection and the
ones also looks pretty exciting and the
last thing I'm going to mention the
favorite is going to my brand new
Louboutin caffeine's mm bag think this
is in the Magnolia shade I have my arms
back for so long I was getting the sort
the smaller the BB size much smaller one
however I collaborate with best ear
collective so as you might know next
year is a company who sell pre-owned
beautiful luxury products you can go
onto there and pick up Lotus and
products that you love from your
favorite brands at discounted rates
optics everything was pre-owned so this
is the one I got and I want to show you
guys I know you love your bags as well
as once you graduate
honestly I'm just selfish man whether it
comes it's perfect
how could it not be a favorite this
month I have no idea okay again it's not
absolutely everything I hope you enjoyed
