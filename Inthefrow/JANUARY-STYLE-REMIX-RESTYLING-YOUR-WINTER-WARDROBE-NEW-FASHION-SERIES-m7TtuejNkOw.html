January style remix so this is gonna be
a brand new fashion series on my channel
and thinking about this one for a while
I'm really loved the way that I created
my autumn Reef style video it's almost
like a lookbook mixed with a few
different outfits that I've restyled
from my wardrobe so decided to call this
a style remix it's gonna be a monthly
episode on my channel and the idea being
that I go into my wardrobe I pick out
four outfits each time each one mixing
up previous seasons the season before
that with brand new items I might have
got that month so the main idea is to
show you guys how to recycle and remix
your wardrobe a little bit bringing in
some new trend pieces but also to kind
of bring out those old favorites still
in your wardrobe so let's get right into
it weird look number one right so for
the first outfit I wanted to kind of
build it around a pair of jeans that I
know so many of you guys probably have
in your wardrobe pair of these the
journey jeans from Topshop high-waisted
I mean yours might not be from Topshop
just pair of good black high-waisted
jeans something you feel confident in
they're very flattering they kind of hug
you in all the right places I mean I
love this pair of jeans I've had journey
jeans now for a couple of years I'm
always buying like the latest pairs
because I just feel super confident in
them they fit me really well so yes I've
pulled these back out of my wardrobe
before these kind of colder wintery
months and I decided to pair it with a
brand new knit so this is a brand new
knit that I picked up the other day in
race I love the textures and the
patterning through this net with the
blacks the Grays there's also metallic
threading that works its way through in
there as well it's got quite a small
turtleneck very shallow to Ethel neck
but it's also quite a long length as
well so it kind of feels super cozy a
little bit oversized the same time I
find that with this patterning and the
overall kind of colors in this it still
looks really flattering and paired with
your normal kind of black behind waisted
jeans it's just quite an elevated look
you could also took this in if you
wanted if you wanted to create a little
bit more shape I left mine untucked for
the outfit which I'll show you in a
second yeah you can style it however you
like but that's the way that I thought
it looked really good love this
absolutely gorgeous new piece for the
season
write it up a little bit I'm a little
bit obsessed of this I've mentioned this
in my vlogs I bake my cap I've never had
one these before threw it on one day in
the store and really really liked it but
again it kind of elevates the outfit
gives a bit more kind of accessorizing a
bit of edge just something a little bit
more fancy why not be more fancy but
then there's an overcoat I pulled out
this old favorite I think camel coats
are the perfect jacket style for the
winter and this one is an old one I have
from Marge it's a couple of seasons old
if not a couple of years old if you want
to go something very very Francine
gorgeous so then the max Mar of camel
coats are one of those like super famous
popular pieces this is one fromage i
find that zara also do a lot of
incredible camel coats i'll see you top
shop now again as well it's gonna kind
of look around like I said I'll leave
some jokes down below for once that I
find with something a little bit more
formal quite a lot of shape to it a bit
more structure yeah so throw this on
over top of the monochrome just lifts up
let's call it a little bit but to go
with the blue off the cap I went from
one sheet one sham to go and again I've
had this for a couple years now maybe
even three years it's one of those kind
of staple back to my wardrobe it's still
one of my like top five bags ever just
because it's just so I mean it's
gorgeous it's such a popular style it's
such a strong structured shape it
doesn't really go out of fashion and
again it just kind of works really well
with the color schemes bringing a bit
more color and life to this outfit but
then for shoes I went with a pair that I
bought last year the veteran on boots
and you can still buy these in varying
color so this is like a reflector on the
back minor and white we can also get the
red the silk girlboss is something very
sexy about these boots so I want to kind
of put them on with the kind of very
long gated high-waisted jeans just to
kind of create that really long gorgeous
shape plus I'm just having more than
enough
and I love them well as an alternative I
have also recently bought these bad boys
which i think are absolutely gorgeous
and so affordable as well these are more
of a sock boot style than the leather
Payton of the best Iman boots but the
overall kind of long heel very pointed
toe very similar height style these are
a good choice - I just want me the best
amounts for the outfit
overall not for looking out where to
meetings if I've got a shopping with the
girls if I was gonna like a little walk
out with Alex you know it's kind of
thing that's super easy to throw on you
could swap up that jacket if you don't
something quite as formal but you know
work it the way you like
okay out for number two is one that I
absolutely loved maybe eight months ago
six months ago it's this dress just a
kind of knitted dress long length
I mean jumper dresses are amazing for
winter with Albany boots calf length
boots yes I wanted to pull this one back
out with the Wardrobe because I haven't
worn it now in a few months and I think
it's such a great item to have man
wardrobe it's just really flattering on
it's quite slinky so it pulls me in all
the right places it has got a few button
detailing and this orange band around
the wrists those extra details make it
that much more fun
so with this though I did it was all
about the shoots and these are a brand
new pair of Jean P Taurasi boots and the
arsalan the sale actually if you did
want to get yourself a pair of calf
length but I had not actually got a pair
of calf length boots before so I can't
really wanted to add a pair to my
wardrobe very on trend at the moment you
can sell them at a lot of different
things and these are ones I decide to go
for like a very charcoal dark grey it's
a great cone heel shape just very very
cool and with this dress just give it a
little bit of something different it's
the perfect height the length of the
dress so they work really really well
but then to go over the top I pulled out
this old marsh jacket which I think I've
had now a couple of years although I
feel like Marge constantly comes rejects
this brings it back each season
absolutely stunning color of like a
raspberry cherry red but with the blue
and the dark grey of the shoes it just
worked in a really gorgeous color combo
I thought I mean you could go with a
black leather jacket if you wanted to
even a really gorgeous camel light beige
could work or a dark grey or a light
grey but I just wanted a little bit more
color so I thought this worked really
really well
just for a little bit of bling I paired
it with my Jimmy Choo bag again just
with a little bit more kind of
patterning detailing going on and I
thought the colors work really well
okay so the third look that I'm
absolutely loving for the season works
around one of my favorite things in the
world but you probably know already
knitwear I have so much neck where I
love it especially real next I just feel
really put together and quite confident
quite slick when I'm wearing it elongate
the neck gives that really gorgeous
shape I don't think they're really
flattering so this is one I've added to
my collection you've probably seen this
quite a few times before I got it about
four months ago beautiful material super
soft I'm pretty sure to pull a bit of
cashmere and this this is from end peel
so it's always a very kind of fancy knit
but again I can leave some chips down
below some places you can find it if
you're looking for something a little
bit more affordable but for something
extra special I really do love this
brand so I wanted to pull it back out
again but with that I threw on my new
jacket again you'll see this in the
vlogs at the day when I did my little
Selfridges whole but I had to bring this
into this because to be honest I've been
throwing this on what I've been going
out I went out today I was wearing this
the other day I was wearing this in
Iceland the whole time I was pretty much
wearing this so this is going to be a
staple for me I think the season
I honestly think these are gonna fly out
of the store absolutely beautiful it's a
faux shearling jacket in a gorgeous deep
Navy the fabrics and the materials and
the way they're kind of contrasting
against each other the textures just
give this such an expensive look I
thought this would be so much more than
actually is I mean it's still quite
pricey it's 200 pounds but I honestly
thought it would be in may 600 to 800
pound price categories I wanted to throw
this on with the looks I think it's
beautiful and great for the time of year
in our kind of UK weather through those
just a very easy pair of leather
leggings you can go for non leather if
you like faux leather well it's just
something so flattering quite kind of
like cool sexy about leather leggings or
leather trousers these are just a pair
from Rhys I often get my leather
trousers from Rhys I think they fit
really really well although I always sat
down there that in mind but these ones
are just kind of cool I've got a very
Jean style with the flat pockets and the
whale about at the seams in that area so
imagine you got a pair of trousers or
jeans this looks really cool so I paired
it with those overall I absolutely love
these boots and I'm not
I'm not got you have kind of occasions
to wear them for and the weather's been
so bad but these are a pair of velvet
Jimmy Choo boots very me I mean we've
got a bit of a sock boot style very
pointed toe high-heeled it's a very cool
rectangular shape I've paired them with
this half because I like my idea of mix
up the textures so you've got this kind
of faux shearling leathers sheepskin
knit velvet it's kind of like loads
different textures and I actually really
looked it all together I mean if you
wanted to you could swap it out for a
pair of normal sock boots just in like a
cotton in material you could even go for
cool pairs like white trainers would
look good with this because it'll match
with the nicked you know you could pair
it your way but for me and the boots
kind of gal so these are a big favorite
best season for accessorizing this bag I
do not get enough wear of its little
Chanel bag I think it's cold I never
know what new it is this is a very cute
shape gorgeous cream color I wanted to
pair it all together to pull in the
colors with the knit when you've got the
darker richer tones with the boots and
the jacket and the trousers
well that's the fourth look for those
events that are a little bit more formal
maybe more elegant but I still want to
kind of remain quite me so and I wanted
to pair it around this table so this top
I got last year it's a summer on t-shirt
it's somewhat quite expensive when you
first buy it but the cost per wear is
amazing I have worn this to death
you're probably so sick I've seen this
to be honest but I think it's a really
great well fitted t-shirt it's just got
a very cool style and I love the logo so
paired it with pair of trousers that I'm
obsessed with you may have seen this out
for actually on a recent vlog but I
wanted to kind of bring it into a proper
video and talk about Wired style this
way this is a new pair of trousers from
Ian Ayre I love this brand I see my hair
red you know but I mean it could just be
a generic pair of Navy Travis even black
trousers but the thing I like about
these is this extra detail this striping
down each side leg and these gold
buttons there's a bit of the-- match
loads are quite a few things in here
that have like gold button detail but
they just got a very cool style but not
too fitted they fit well around the
waist give you that flattering
silhouette within on the leg they just
added a little bit more shape so paired
that with the t-shirt and took to end to
cinch everything in and then over the
top my pride and joy so this is a brand
new seller McCartney later that I got in
sale 50% off it's still on sale and
pretty sure all the sizin still left so
if you did want to treat yourself to a
super gorgeous blazer I would highly
recommend this one if I so many
compliments on it so far it just kind of
adds that lift and that brightness to
any outfit it just works so well with
the blue of the trousers as well so I
thought those three together I mean it's
a very me outfit I would wear about two
kind of my special meetings if I wanted
to kind of make a bit more of an
impression and look a bit more formal
together
but still show a bit personality and
style as well so I pulled out an old
pair face my Sharpie too rustic
elaborate course but I actually love
them I've worn today at the cost per
wear of these is like insane the paint
works so well but with the still a
mechanic's blazer
well there isn't too much color there
it's quite subtle they're just a great
pair of shoes I look them I'm a big big
fan of the front and to finish look off
my brand new Valentino toe
the colors of this are so spring it's
amazing I don't know how this is already
in sale I I got this himself tips and
off I don't understand how when this is
the most spring appropriate bag I think
I've ever bought so that's kind of why I
just defined the fact that I bought this
even if it's enough it's still an
expensive art - you know back but I knew
that I would get so much wear out of it
because the colors are so brilliant for
spring so it's wrinkled not quite soon
and I'm gonna get a hell of a lot of
wear out of this I don't need to be
careful because it's very light-colored
suede but it's just the prettiest bag so
much room in here I've had so many
compliments on this already and I know
so many of you guys they'll watch my
videos and follow my Instagram a little
bit too so I'm super pleased but again
it just added a little bit more fun but
not colored the whole outfit but the
Pink's work well with the color tones I
do like to mix my colors
so those are the four outfits that I'm
really really feeling for this month of
January let me know down below in the
