really really well welcome back to a new
favorites video it is January and I have
accumulated a few pieces since the last
time I did a favorites video which I
think may have been my sort of roundup
of 2015 so I really hope you enjoyed
that that was a lot of products I think
there were 40 products so you've not
seen that already and seen what I loved
for all of 2015 combined and go have a
look at that I'll leave a link down
below
well wise let's get into what I loved
for this previous month and just to mix
things up a little bit let's start with
fashion this time I might say first of
all start with this which is a black
chunky knit top what is from I think
this might be from misguided I mean the
cool thing about misguided is that they
do do some really on trend wearable
fashionable pieces regardless of whether
they're high-end luxury whether they're
low end or mid high street my god it's
so windy yeah and I just like something
really cozy and easy to wear so this is
a lovely black chunky knit I leave link
down below
equally front this is from misguided to
this dress
I've Wallace a few times in my snapchat
if you don't follow me already it's just
in the fro it falls about in-between
your knee and sort of hip area so it's
not really really short like it you can
either get away with this for most
occasions well there's something really
flattering about it it's got a belt that
goes around the middle so it really
cinches you in nicely the shirt
detailing the buttons is really quite
flattering the pocket areas and some of
the details are quite military asked I
don't know it's got a really and the
colour as well when I've got a tan and
kind of got your legs out and all shaved
and pretty and a nice business really
really lovely and in fact with that I
really love wearing it with these shoes
which was such a good investment piece
when I bought that mean I'm a massive
fan of shall be Taurasi as you probably
know but I saw these and thought these
shoes are going to go with everything I
own and I was so right they're just so
easy black suede court shoes with a
pointed toe as I always love a lot of
really
going to tow us and look me sexy and
sophisticated they're not incredibly
high so they're very easy to walk in and
feel into heels and you're like walking
in heels then you'll be absolutely fine
in these but not too too high but
they're just a very classy classic
timeless pair of heels so I've been
finding that these with that misguided
dress just seem to look quite cute
I just paired it with silver jewelry and
a black bag and I went the next piece
you'll have seen in my asshole but I'm
so obsessed with it it's just a plain
grey mild body but these bodies are just
so easy to wear with absolutely
everything in my wardrobe so whether
it's leather trousers whether it's a
pair of my Hudson jeans I've been loving
recently it goes down to poppies in the
body but it's just very fluttering if
you're quite spelt and quite slim it's
definitely a very very flattering style
and it's just so affordable that I think
it's like 18 pounds and I've been
wearing it so often I mean sorry to all
my friends and everyone else that seen
me in this cuz I've literally not taken
off but it's just one of those basic
pieces that goes with everything in your
wardrobe the final piece of clothing is
actually a jacket from Marsh
it's just this one black and if you
follow my Instagram again in the fro
you'll have seen this on so many
pictures of me and on my blog
it's always my blog at the moment in
fact this is also in sale it's like huh
I've got this half price and I'm pretty
sure they still have like all sizes left
it's just one of those coats again that
goes with everything that you want to
wear whether it's casual or not casual
but it will make it look a little bit
more formal a little bit more
sophisticated pulled together it looks
like you've made more of an effort and
you're a little bit more kind of fashion
aware I guess it's something really
slick about black coat especially when
they put and up and they're woolen it's
like warm and I don't know I really love
this style so this I have not taken off
I absolutely adore it I'm going to Paris
again tomorrow and I'm sure I'll be
traveling in this I gained because it's
just a really really great wearable
piece so I thought I've mentioned it to
some KC guys can still get it in sale
yes thing I'm in love with is my brand
new iPhone I've gone for the iPhone 6
s+ in the rose gold because it's hard to
say with braces on the 6s yeah in the
rose gold the only things different to
the I feel six some Desai's obviously
larger screen is quite good for watching
YouTube videos like this it looks pretty
because it's rose gold but I mean that's
very aesthetic thing but otherwise I
guess the camera is all a little bit
better the battery life a little bit
better but I must say the sound quality
is not better I feel like the sound
quality of the iPhone 6 is better than
this but either way I'm so in love with
it right now and I've got some pretty
peonies and the book right it's very
very cliche bloggers doing this but I
just want something really bright and
pretty so I want for peonies which are
my favorite flower anyway moving on to
beauty so let's go with let's start with
this from the girl this is the
meteorites oxygen care moisturizer and
radiance booster which you can use
underneath your foundation as a
moisturizer and also as kind of a
radiance serum almost it's creamy and it
also has when you look at the lights
almost got a duo chrome pink oh it's so
pretty almost goes like a little baby
pink I don't think it's that but it does
have a feeling of cream a creamy serum
and when you rub it into the skin I mean
you'll probably see this soon I've got
it coming up in a few tutorials actually
I filmed a few tutorials already and
I've used this bad boy so you'll see it
on my skin under the lights and you'll
see how just how much it has so much
luminosity into the skin it's not Primus
so if you do love promise I'd also put
primer over this and any foundation but
as a luminous radiant space and a
moisturizer this is so stunning I'm
total of it all so smart apps later on
it's got the girl and violet smell if
you know go on well you'll know it's got
a smell is a bit like parlor violets
which I personally adore I love foil it
but I've spoken with a lot of the team
and is apparently natural it's all
natural fragrance so that is pretty good
too
moving on words lip products I think I
might have mentioned these in my last
favorites but we're going to mention
again do your lip glow is totally rock
my world at No
it really is such a brick Oh what if I
don't do this oh oh it must have been
open open up a little that's annoying
again I use this soon in a tutorial or
two and this is something so brightening
is it's really hydrating really my
strengthening it just saw transforms
your lips it's kind of thing you can
kind of reaching your back get it out
put it on your lips and you know your
lips immediately look beautiful coated
and it's gorgeous baby pink Sheen it's
just kind of perfecting so I love that
and then over the top or when the--the
I've been adding the rose wood lip liner
by Burberry because it's just that
perfect shade of nude and I've been
putting a lot of instagrams lot recently
wearing this and have so many people
like what's on your lips what you
wearing now and it's kinda like this is
my new when you go to so I love this and
then I still the top all the way around
depending on how lazy I'm being not seem
to find this online anyway I'm so sorry
but I honestly think if you go into um
the Burberry boutiques they'll be able
to help you and find this for you I'm
sure in fact speaking of Burberry I also
wanted to include these I am so in love
with these products they are absolutely
stunning
it's the Burberry eye color creams and
I've got a few shades here that I wanted
to mention I think one of them is one of
the limited edition Star Wars or one
they're sort of newer collection pieces
and this is in number 110 damson and
it's a stunning eyeshadow cream in a
plum e wealth tamson shade I guess for
me purple the colors build up
beautifully the kind of thing you put in
the crease of your eye as keep building
the color it becomes more and more
intense and more beautiful and it has
this sort of flemish sheen to it
beautiful so that's dump them but I'm
also truly right now in love with this
which is mink and little 102 it's one of
those shades that you could wear every
single day you can really see but it's
metallicky bronzed that wonderful shade
of soft bronze brown it's so gorgeous
and again I've just been sweeping like
Mac to one seven blending
through this and just so roughly
applying it into the crease of my eye
and all over my eye and it catches the
light in all the right places because a
very natural and quite neutral but
really pop when you catch them too light
beautiful and two of the things I wanted
to mention are my two new favorite
foundations can't decide between them
because I love them both very very much
for different reasons so I'll go through
that first one is a new Chanel leg beige
this is a collection of beige toned
foundations Alison I would suggest so
they're not really pink toned they're
not really yellow toned it's very beige
and very natural I prefer shade 20 when
I bit my tongue I also mix it with shade
number 30
it gives me quite a great complexion
that way this reminds me in the
consistency of something between Laura
Mercier silk cream now she aglow
Charlotte Tilbury magic Foundation and
potentially kind of our Marni luminous
silk if you can see me apply it as you
can see it's not really but it's quite
thick and medium coverage buildable too
much more sort of heavier coverage this
is certainly not something you'd want to
wear if you prefer lightweight
foundations it kind of rests in the
middle as on those fantastic medium
coverage foundations I feel so many
people are going to be like so smitten
with this soon I know that I am the
second foundation I want to mention it's
a Giorgio Armani maestro glow which he
was seeing all over my Instagram and all
over my blog and I'm totally obsessed
with it
so this isn't like any of the foundation
I've tried and I went to the soft
pressed talk with the marketing director
of Armani and also the creative director
at Armani who were talking through this
foundation which was so interested
because I've already fall in love with
it balance so the fact they were talking
through it and we're how it have come to
be and what they're done to make it so
create like creatively amazing was very
very inspiring inside here are five
essential oils mixed with pigment which
is why when you kind of get to it'll be
so settled with pigment and then oil
you gotta give it a really good shake
mix the two together in comparison to
Chanel you'll put it on and it drips
like it's much more liquidy it'll sort
of drip everywhere it's got more of an
oily consistency but when you add it
onto the skin the oils and the pigment
just gleam like the Sun it just looks
like some beams lighting you it without
being like disco ball obviously it's not
like it's not crazy but it's just
absolutely beautiful and naturally ultra
jus aglow and the idea then is that the
essential oils of the day will evaporate
off of the skin to leave the pigments
are set into skin and making your
complexion look absolutely perfect and I
can honestly vouch for it I'm so in love
with this can't even tell you it's a
very creative it's a very clever
foundation but the makeup artist totally
said no it's for all skin types it isn't
just for dry skin or normal skin anyone
with oily skin can also use this so
don't back away from the fact that it is
law oils so smitten with this totally in
love with it I can't vouch for anymore
that is everything I think there aren't
many other pieces that I was like
totally in love with this month I feel
like these pieces I've mentioned I love
love loved so this is definitely
reflection of things I use the most
coveted the most so hopefully you've
enjoyed it if you did make sure to get
the video alike that's always amazing
and subscribe so you can come back for
the next video I post every Wednesday in
Sundays and if that's the case and I
will see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
