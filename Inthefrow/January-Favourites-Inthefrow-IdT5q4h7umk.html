really really well welcome back to a new
favorites video it is January and I've
accumulated a few pieces since the last
time i did a favorites video which i
think may have been my sort of roundup
of 2015 so i really hope you enjoyed
that that was a lot of products i think
there were 40 products so you've not
seen that already and seen what i loved
for all of 2015 combined and go have a
look at that i'll leave a link down
below with wise let's get into what i
loved for this previous months and thus
to mix things up a little bit let's
start with fashion this time I might so
first of all start with this which is a
block shrinking it top um what it is
from I think this might be from
misguided I mean the cool thing about
misguided is that they do do some really
on trend wearable fashionable pieces
regardless of whether high-end luxury
whether low-end ah mid high street my
god it's so windy yeah and I just wait
something really cozy and easy to wear
so this is a lovely black chunky knit
I'll leave link down below equally front
this is from misguided to this dress
I've wallets a few times in my snapchat
if you don't follow me already it's just
in the Frog it falls about in between
your knee and sort of hip area so it's
not really really short like it you can
either get away of this for most
occasions well there's something really
flattering about it it's got a belt that
goes around the middle so it really
cinches you in nicely the shirt detail
the buttons is really quite flattering
the pocket areas and some of the details
are quite military ask I don't know it's
got a really and the color as well when
I've got a tan and kind of got your legs
out and I'll shaved and pretty and a
nice business really really lovely and
in fact with that I really love wearing
it with these shoes which was such a
good investment piece when I bought that
mean I'm a massive fan of shall be to a
rusty as you probably know but I saw
these and thought of these shoes are
going to go with everything i own and i
was so right there just so easy black
suede court shoes with a pointed toe as
i always loved a lot of really
tell us in look really sexy and
sophisticated they're not incredibly
high so they're very easy to walk in and
you're into heels and you're like
walking in heels then you'll be
absolutely fine in these but not too too
high but they're just a very classy
classic timeless pair of heels so I've
been finding that these with that
misguided dress to seem to look quite
cute I just paired it with silver
jewelry and a black bag and a way I went
the next pcl have seen in my ass asshole
but I'm so obsessed with it it's just
the plain grey mild body but these
bodies are just so easy to wear with
absolutely everything in my wardrobe so
whether it's leather trousers whether
it's a pair of like hudson jeans i've
been loving recently it goes down to pop
is in the body but it's just very
fluttering if you're quite spelt and
quite slim it's definitely a very very
flattering style and it's just so
affordable little think it's like 18
pounds and I've been wearing it so often
I mean sorry to all my friends and
everyone else at seeing me in this cuz
I've literally not taken off but it's
just one of those basic pieces that goes
with everything in your wardrobe the
final piece of clothing is actually a
jacket from marsh it's just this one
with the black and if you follow my
Instagram again in the fro you'll have
seen this on so many pictures of me and
on my blog it's always my blog at the
moment in fact this is also in sale it's
like ha I've got this half price and I'm
pretty sure they still have like all
sizes left it's just one of those coats
again that goes with everything that you
want to wear whether it's casual are not
casual but it will make it look a little
bit more formal a little bit more
sophisticated pulled together it looks
like you've made more of an effort and
you're a little bit more kind of fashion
aware I guess I think there's something
really slick about black coat especially
when they put an up and a woollen it's
like warm and I don't know a real love
this style so this I have not taken off
I absolutely adore it I'm going to Paris
again tomorrow and I'm sure i'll be
travelling in this again because it's
just a really really great wearable
piece so i thought i've mentioned it to
some kc guys can still get it in sale
yes think I'm in love with is my brand
new iphone I've gone for the iphone 6s
plus in the rose gold
because hard to say with braces on the
6s plus yet in the rose gold the only
things different to the iphone 6 some
the size obviously larger screen is
quite good for watching YouTube videos
like this it looks pretty because it's
real gold but I mean that's very
aesthetic thing but otherwise I guess
the camera is all this a little bit
better the battery life a little bit
better but I must say the sound quality
is not better I feel like the sound
quality of the iphone 6 is better than
this but either way I'm so in love with
it right now and I've got some pretty
peonies and the book right is very very
cliche bloggers doing this but I do
something really bright and pretty so I
want for peonies which are my favorite
flower anyway moving on to beauty so
let's go with let's not this from go on
this is the meteorites oxygen care
moisturizer and radiance booster which
you can use underneath your foundation
as a moisturizer and also as caliph of
radiance serum almost it's creamy and it
also has when you look at the lights
almost got a duochrome pink oh it's so
pretty almost goes like a little baby
pink at one frequency that but it does
have a feeling of cream a creamy serum
and when you rub into skin I mean you'll
probably see this soon I've got it
coming up in a few tutorials actually I
filmed a few tutorials already and I've
used this bad boy so you'll see it on my
skin under the lights and you'll see how
just how much it has so much luminosity
into the skin it's that Primus so if you
do love prime is I'd also put primer
over this and any foundation but as a
luminous radiant space and a moisturizer
this is so stunning I'm total of it also
smells absolute around it's got the
galan violets smell if you know girl
unwell you'll know it's got a smell it's
a bit like Palmer violence which I
personally adore I love file it but I've
spoken with a lot of the team and is
apparently natural it's all natural
fragrance so that is pretty good too
moving onwards lip products I think i
mighta mentioning similar favorites I'm
going to mention again do your lip glow
is totally rocking my world at the
moment it really is such a
right o what I done to this Oh looks
like i've ruined it oh oh it must have
been open open up a little that's
annoying again I use this soon in a
tutorial or two and this is something so
brightening is it's really hydrating
really moisturizing it just saw
transforms your lips it's kind of thing
you can kind of reaching you back get it
out put it on your lips and you know
your lips immediately look beautiful
coated it's gorgeous baby pink sheen
it's just kind of perfecting so I love
that and then over the top Orton thief
I've been adding the rose wood lip liner
by burberry because it's just that
perfect shade of nude and then put a lot
of instagrams lot recently wearing this
and have so many people like what's on
your lips what you wearing now and it's
kind of like this is my new when you go
to so I love this and then I still the
top all the way around depending on how
lazy i'm being can't seem to find this
online anyway I'm so sorry but i
honestly think if you go into on the
burberry boutiques they'll be able to
help you and find this for you I'm sure
in fact speaking of Burberry I also want
to include these I am so in love with
these products they are absolutely
stunning it's the burberry I color
creams and I've got a few shades here
that wanted to mention i think one of
them is one of the limited edition star
wars or wonder sort of newer collection
pieces and this is in number 110 damson
and it's a stunning i show cream in a
plummy wealth damson shade i guess for
me purple the colors build up
beautifully that the kind of thing you
put in the crease of your eye and keep
building the color and it becomes more
and more intense and more beautiful and
it has this sort of Glenn machine to it
beautiful so that's down them but I'm
also truly right now in love with this
which is mink little 102 it's one of
those shades that you could wear every
single day you can really see but it's
metallicy bronzed that wonderful shade
of soft bronze brown it's so gorgeous
and again I've just been sleeping like
mac 217 blending brush through this
just so roughly applying into the crease
of my eye and all over my eye and it
catches the light in all the right
places because very natural and quite
neutral but really pop when you catch
them to light beautiful and two of the
things i wanted to mention a my two new
favorite foundations can't decide
between them because I love them both
very very much for different reasons so
I'll go through that first one is a new
chanel leg beige this is a collection of
beige tones foundations as the name
suggests so not really pink toned but
not really yellow tone it's very beige
and very natural I prefer shade 20 when
I bit my tongue I also mix it with shade
number 30 gives me quite a great
complexion that way this reminds me in
the consistency of something between
Laura Mercier silk creme now she aglow
Charlotte Tilbury magic foundation and
potentially kind of Armani luminous silk
if you can see me apply it as you can
see does it's not really but it's quite
thick and medium coverage buildable too
much more sort of heavier coverage this
is certainly not something we want to
wear if you prefer lightweight
foundations it kind of rest in the
middle as on those fantastic medium
coverage foundation so I feel so many
people are going to be like so smitten
with this soon I know that I am the
second foundation want to mention its is
Giorgio Armani maestro glow which you
have seen all of my Instagram and all
over my blog and I'm totally obsessed
with it so this isn't like any of the
foundation I've tried and I went to the
suppressed talk with the marketing
director of Armani and also the creative
director at Armani who were talking
through this foundation which was so
interested because I'd already fall in
love with it balanced so the fact they
were talking through it and where how it
come to be and what they're done to make
it so create like creatively amazing was
very very inspiring inside here are five
essential oils mixed with pigment which
is why when you kind of get to it will
be so settled with pigment and then oil
so you've got to give it really
shake mix the two together in comparison
to Chanel you'll put it on it drips like
it's much more liquidy it'll sort of
drift everywhere it's got more of an
oily consistency but when you add it
onto the skin the oils and the pigment
just gleam like the Sun it just looks
like some beams they hitting you it
without being like disco ball obviously
it's not like it's not crazy but it's
just absolutely beautiful and natural
eyes ultra juhi globe and the idea then
is that the essential oils of the day
will evaporate off of the skin to leave
the pigments I'll set into skin and
making your complexion look absolutely
perfect and i can honestly vouch for it
i'm so in love with this can't even tell
you it's a very creative it's a very
clever foundation but the makeup artist
totally said no it's for all skin types
it isn't just for dry skin or normal
skin anyone with oily skin can also use
this so don't back away from the fact
that it is more oils so smitten with
this totally in love with it I can't
vouch her anymore that is everything I
think there aren't many other pieces
that I was like totally in love with
this month I feel like these pieces I've
mentioned I loved loved loved so this is
definitely reflecting the things I use
the most coveted the most so hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did make sure to
get a video alike that's always amazing
and subscribe so you can come back for
the next video i post every wednesday in
sunday's and if that's the case and i
will see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
