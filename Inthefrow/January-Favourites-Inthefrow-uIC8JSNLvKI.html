do really really well I thought I'd fill
my January favorites today and honestly
I'm not loving that many new products so
I found this a little bit more difficult
to pull things together but I still
found a good amount of things to show
you a things I've been using a lot more
this month and what I'm really really
liking really let's get started Beach
products so first thing is the new
collection from Real Techniques the
balls methyls collection I'm sure you've
seen it everywhere all over Instagram
all over YouTube already and in fact I
used a few of the brushes in my lust
drugstore makeup tutorial if you saw
that and you'll see which ones I was
using and there are 7 brushes in the
collection and I wanted to show you four
because these are for that I would
really really recommend so I'd probably
say my favorite one as well if you read
my blog post I'm in the fro calm you
will also know what I'm about to say but
my favorite one is probably this one
it's c200 oval shadow brush by the way
these all have makeup on them because i
use them today this is the oval shadow
brush it's quite a large brush head so
it completely fills your eyelid and can
just quickly sweet color of the top so
you that on the most 300 don't blush
brush I think it's called not sure but
this is a blush and beautiful almost
like heart-shaped dome shape to it and
it's just really cute for kind of adding
a little bit of color onto the edge of
your cheeks but as it's quite compacted
the bristles you just got to make sure
if you tap off any excess before you go
and do that or else you'll have very
very pink cheeks for those of us who
like to contour a lot i know that i do
if you elect contour and you do find it
quite difficult to get the right kind of
shape this is really great again it's
really compacted so if you just dab a
little bit of bronzer or whatever
contour sure you use and put it onto
your cheeks you'll get a really
different contour so then I often use
another brush to kind of blend that all
in or you can use this as well this
brush is just really simple and easy for
applying contour you can't really go
wrong with it and lastly i also really
like the 202 I thinks it's a liner brush
it's just very very tiny you could
probably use this for eyebrows
I use it for eyeliner and just getting
really into the eyelashes and forming a
really lovely at cat's eye and again I
use this in my last troops or tutorial
to create a lovely soft powder eyeshadow
eyeliner look so after 7 brushes that
have come out there are beautiful but
these are the ones i would highly
recommend and i really really love to
you so I'll leave the blog post link
down below as well if you'd like a
little bit more info moving on to my
beautiful butter shop caramel cleansing
water as you know i like my waterproof
mascaras and therefore i need waterproof
eye makeup removers and they can be a
little bit more expensive and i found
that i actually ran out recently and i
delved around and all of my different
cupboards to find some more I makeup
remover and I came across this again I
had for a while I have two types of this
I'm still going through the first one
I'm just nearly finished in actually but
it's just a lovely almost waxy petroleum
jelly almost feeling to it but it works
wonders and I don't think this would
work how much and waterproof eye makeup
remover and actually it really really
does I just take a large cotton pad dip
it into this get quite a lot of product
and its really working into the
eyelashes and it pulls everything away
so this is a really beautiful product so
many of you have recommended this
foundation to me and I always kept
putting it off buying it because it's
quite pricey and I wasn't sure what Shay
teased until I finally managed to pick
it up and it's a Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation I have this insured for
and it's a perfect shade for me it
reminds me very much of NARS sheer glow
deauville which again I absolutely love
so I've been using this really really
enjoying youth net it is again I think
the consistency and the texture of it
again is very similar to now sheer glow
so if you big fun of that then you'll
probably a big fan of us as well similar
kind of coverage medium coverage quite
bill the boy you can definitely build us
up to a much higher coverage if you want
to but it's nothing cakey it does can't
have a nice luminous Regents about it
nothing of the gooey and nothing to Matt
it sort of that middle ground so as a
new foundation I am really enjoying this
month and the last beauty product i'm
going to
should is this from Aiko and it's the I
do liquid eyeliner and I'm pretty sure
this is part of the Alexa Chung range I
think but I've always been a big fan of
the ico eyeliners as you probably will
know from a lot of my other favorites
videos and I really got my hands on this
new one and I'm the thing I really like
about it is that the nib it's a little
bit thicker it literally does look like
sharpie and I'm just finding because
it's so point at the end you can get
such a beautiful cat I flick while also
filling in the eyelashes with much more
black and just creating a really perfect
guy so I'm finding it's just super easy
super simple to use and does exactly
what I wanted to do it doesn't flake and
it's also waterproof sort stay put all
day so this is a big big recommendation
this month I'm going to move on to
clothing so many of you have been asking
me to do more clothing things and I'm so
sorry it is with moving and moving
everything in and whatnot on organizing
all of my clothes I haven't gotten
around to doing a new clothing haul and
in fact I've only recently started
buying more and more clothes so that is
definitely coming more clothing bits and
the look books are definitely on the way
so I'm so sorry that they've taken so
long to arrive however I have four
things here to show you that our
clothing related first thing is my new
daniel wellington watch i think this one
is the bristol watch it's got a lot it's
really hard to show you in it's on it's
got a large brown leather strap it's got
rose gold hardware and it's just quite a
simple style watch but I'm loving it at
the moment just something a bit
different because I often go for metal
strap watches so a nice leather strap is
a nice change for me next up is a pair
of sunnies that I am absolutely in love
at the moment a voice today to a meeting
I could like a cool dude love them
they're club busters and I also have
these you might seen a half song with
purple insides and what color I kind of
know purple yeah i think the purple side
but these are the fully black club
mustard with gold hardware I guess
all over them and almost like green tint
black tint frames they're just really
really cool sunglasses and we are off to
what me and Alex off to Florida tomorrow
for holiday so these will be amazing for
it but I'll also probably wearing these
for Fashion Week if the Sun decides to
come out there just so cool I think that
way fair is I love my Wayfarers as well
but there's something about Club matters
it's assoc can I don't know something
quite retro about them cellular those
next up is a purchase i made from the
outnet actually never bought from the
outnet before but i was on there and
really liking what they had on that and
i really want a new pet offshoot so i
found some from poor live with Victoire
poorly victoire i think that's probably
what it is I'm really really lucky so I
think they're so classy and chic and
elegant what are they called let's see
what these are called zany these are the
zany leather pumps so they have a
completely closed toe pointed toe and it
goes up in this leather strap across the
middle around the size and it off the
ankle and it has a zip off the back as
well and I was really like the fact that
it's got this sort of half split heel
with the silver section um nothing too
high in terms of heel height and wearing
them they're actually super comfortable
especially because you've got all of
your and cool kept in and secure inside
the shoe it always makes you feel a
little bit more safe and much more
comfortable I find if your ankle is kept
inside so these are the shoes and I
haven't yet war on them I'm just waiting
for the right dress to wailing with but
the decks are going to make an
appearance at london fashion week when i
start putting my outfits together I
think those really chic be quite
comfortable for me to wear around
because fashion we can get pretty
uncomfortable and also I really like
this little symbol we have this almost
like a bow and arrow symbol for the
brand it's cute just on the very very
bottom of the shoes so those are some
new shoes love those and I've saved the
very very best until last and it is
something that I went on about on my
Twitter for a few days and people that
you have to buy
have to buy it because it was in sale so
I finally picked it up something that
I've wanted for so long and it's my new
Victoria Beckham dress it's so cute and
I might take you to Florida with me is
that gonna be a bad idea I don't know
maybe not i might save it I'm going to
save it definitely for Fashion Week this
is something that will be coming out in
fashion week but it's not too sure which
is quite nice it's not too sure what so
ever it could probably look quite nice
with those poor live aguar pumps i just
bought but it's so pretty it has a zit
up the back crochet knitted fabric and
then it has these wraps over both sides
it's off come on look little wraps just
add a little bit more texture and shape
to address this I have to get this in a
size 8 because the size 60 about I think
they must do size six enough to but it's
sold out there's only one size 8 left
and i got it in sale so it's reduced by
about 75 cent and this is from coggles I
didn't mention acts from coggles and it
had about 75 cent off and I managed to
get left size 8x I have to now it fits
me it fits me okay but I feel like it
could be a little bit more cinched in so
in that case I think I'm going to weigh
little belt with it so perfectly fine
and i love it so much i'll try and leave
a link below to somewhere else that you
might be able to get this because it is
so pretty it's got a little Victoria
Beckham logo inside stitched in and I
just cannot wait to wear it so this has
been my favorite purchase of the month
for definite what's that was for beauty
for fashion I guess I'll also mention
the fact that i absolutely love this too
i bought this from zara in sale it was
20 power juice from 40 i think and it's
one of those really cool long links mr.
dresses well it's actually meant to be
knitted jumper but I've got it in the
medium sit really up sighs and
everywhere pneus just with long over
knee boots and it looks super cute you
might seen it again in my Instagram um
if you don't follow me on this gum
twitter by the way to catch up on all
these things that i've been talked about
then just look for me as in the fro and
that's everything for january i did
manage to
I'm just enough things that I thought
I'd have a bit less but yeah I really
