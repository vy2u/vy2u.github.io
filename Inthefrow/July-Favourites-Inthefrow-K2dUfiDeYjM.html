favorites video this time for July
I can't believe July's already come and
gone it was my birthday on the 18th it
came and it went and it was awesome and
it was such a great month and I've
accumulated a few things that I really
really adored this month so I thought
we'd go through those and go through my
July favorites let's just start with
beauty as always good start with a few
skincare bits first up being the Vichy
Purex thermal what proof I make a
remover I think about I mentioned this
before or I've definitely mentioned
something very similar I don't know if
you have changed the bottle or what
exactly has changed here but it's pretty
much the exact same product that I've
had before I'm sure
so on the only things I can really use
now take off my waterproof mascara
it works wonders it is so soft on the
eyes and just take something away it's
really really brilliant
cartman for now which retailer I got
this wrong but I will leave the link
down below from I can get it from it is
so brilliant next up I have switched up
my skincare a little bit in terms of
night cream now this is the LMS Pro
collagen marine cream ultra rich cream
cuz I recently went into the LMS Spa run
new one is gorgeous by the way
highly recommended that would also be a
favorite at this month because I have
the most amazing treatments made my
brows don't know how my eyelashes dawn I
mentioned this before but if this is so
much fun in there and I'm definitely
going back much more often so highly
recommended but I was in there they did
like a skin test thing where they test
what your skin is like how its
dehydrated or maybe it's greasy or oily
or get your wrinkles it's really
insightful to see and they have
recommended a few products and one of
them being that I need to have more rich
moisturizers to add a little bit more
moisture and hydration back into my skin
so they recommended this warmer so I
have been using it nightly and also
daily as well it is meant to be a day
cream but I love it for nighttime as
well because it does smell so
beautiful that's a real at aquatic smell
it's really really fresh and beautiful
so this has been something I'm loving
right now
Nexen beauty is my new favorite lip
combo again I mention this in a recent
video but it see a mirror Ness lip liner
in cocoa crazy cocoa which is sort of
beige nudes beige nude a-pink's and then
on top of that I like to layer this
which is the new six lip and cheek
pencil in elope which is a really
beautiful pink I just really need two
pencil sharpened that but I'm wearing it
now on my lips that's line with this
fill with this and I love how soft nude
pink it is really lovely finish my new
favorite palette is the erm Decay Naked
palette you've probably seen this
everywhere
I know I've seen so many weakness for
tutorials I would all like to show you
this in a tutorial because it's so
brilliant it's got some gorgeous shades
and they're much more smokey neutral
sister and rather than the kind of
Browns and pink tone Browns we've seen
previously from the Naked palette this
one though I have been loving for the
past few weeks on my eyes using hi dirty
sweet and radar mainland and also
combust here as a crease shade so I do
this in a tutorial really soon because
it's almost my new everyday look so I'm
really living at palette for that reason
and pretty short is out if it is a
little links down below if not you'll be
out in a week or so new favorite
highlighter again this has been
everywhere and I almost feel silly
mentioning this but I'm gonna mention it
because it is so brilliant and it's the
Becca Jaclyn hill highlighter in this
almost rose gold highlight it's
incredible especially if you're into
strobing and highlighting at the moment
I am loving this it's the only highlight
I have use now for the past two and a
half weeks since I bought it from
Sephora I got it shipped over from
Sephora that's pretty much daily placing
buy it I think and it cost about 45
pounds with shipping but it's fantastic
it will last me forever there's so much
in there you need a little sleep and
it's like two row
it is beautiful so big big big favorite
and without actually realized and this
is Becca as well this is the shimmering
skin perfector for anyone that loves to
highlight beneath their foundation this
is also a fantastic product I've been
adding this over the top of my
moisturizer just to really enhance the
globe before I put on the foundation and
I really feel like it adds so much more
radiance into the skin so I've been
loving this then foundation and there's
adding champagne pop I didn't mention
that before I've got champagne you pop
over the top to my cheekbones bow down
my nose brow bone and it's just like
boom boom boom looking amazing and the
last beauty product I'm gonna mention is
this little cutie and it's scenic beauty
blender the actual Beauty Blender and
I'm pretty sure the thing that kicked it
all off in first place my needs a bit of
a wash sorry I use it today I know that
I love the Real Techniques sponge and I
would highly recommend that one if
you're looking for a drugstore
alternative this one's about 22 pounds
but I'll be completely honest with you
this one is better it's definitely
better just the fact it's just a bit
more pointed a bit smaller so it fits
into the creases and what easier I'm
just finding that this is making my
makeup so much more flawless I love it
it's just the genius tool but everyone
needs whether it's this one or another
sponge just a sponge in general
definitely need for this one I live okay
using our from Beauty next up we have
some jewelry don't think I mentioned
jewelry in a while because tomorrow's a
dope wear that much and when I do wear
it it's because I'm absolutely all of it
recently you may have seen a blog post I
did where I wore some gorgeous Pandora
jewelry Pandora is a brand I've always
really respected and really liked but
I've never really bought into it that
much but recently they brought out the
Pandora Rose shade which to me new is
more of a rose gold shade they call it
Pandora rose I just feel like this has
completely changed up their collection
it's just made it so much more on trend
it almost calls out to a slightly
different consumer than they had before
it's especially calling out to me as a
consumer and
I'm loving the shades rather than
Silver's and the goals you had before so
I have the gorgeous bracelet I have
couple of the Rings it's beautiful
feather rings and one little bow and I
also have the matching pendant which
with the beautiful rose golden Pandora
rose feather with little diamond tips on
all over there and then a silver chain
I'm gonna wearing these sue for wedding
as well and I think it'll be a beautiful
wedding jewelry a little bit of clothing
absolutely adoring this skirt this is a
real suede skirt from River Island I've
worn it in a blog post recently and now
I'm wearing it a new blog post coming up
soon it is so flattering since this a
line shape it's extremely flattering it
fits around the way so I'm also looking
at high-waisted style beautiful suede
just if you do buy this be so careful
that you don't get anything on it and
make sure you spray it with some suede
protector because you can easily ruin it
but I absolutely adore skirt it's such a
great investment for the season as well
for the kind of suede and tan suede look
that is going on right now and next
favorite is a stunning purchase I made
for march in Paris I went into Marsh
Thor when I was in Paris recently and
they had the best sale on ever I mean
it's the French brand anyway I'm pretty
sure so it was at French prices and then
also sale so the prices were incredible
but everything is awesome sale here so
I'll leave the link down below for this
but this skirt is absolutely beautiful
really large floral print and then on
the inside it has this white bodycon
skirt kind of protect your dignity but
then everything else is just so
beautiful it's kind of knee-length I'm
just absolutely in love with it so I'm
gonna be wearing that for a wedding with
this nude blush camisole so I got from
Topshop which is also fair at this month
because it's just so easy to wear
I've not worn anything like for a while
actually so I'm really excited to wear
it lovely almost coral toned blush pink
so polyester I'm gonna have to be really
careful with it I think it was around 22
pounds Oh 16 16 pounds somebody wearing
this tucked into this white skirt with
rose gold heels and ruffled jewelry and
it should look really really pretty so
hopefully if I've worn these I'll insert
a picture here if you have to have a
little look at it see the pieces and the
final thing I'm going to mention you
will already know and you already have
seen these if you watch my last video
the designer shoe collection video
hopefully you've seen that leave a link
down below if you do not but if you want
to see my designer shoe collection they
may want to go to that video but I'll
mention these again because these are
just a huge favorite this month and then
my brand new Christian Louboutin Galilei
we go someone had a go at me recently
and said it's not big all a big owl I
think that's what they said anyway 120s
which means I'm pretty sure at me 120
millimeter heel so these are pretty down
high of course the red sole but they're
just I just thought there was so
statement sexy stunning they'll be hard
to walk in granted
they'll be uncomfortable but they're
also absolutely beautiful and they'll go
with so many gorgeous outfits cute
myself sees because it was my birthday
last week and I wanted to get myself a
little present so this is what I bought
myself and absolutely love that and that
is everything I loved for the month of
July it really was a great month I'm
