favorites video this time for july i
can't believed realize already come and
gone it was my birthday on the 18 it
came and it went and it was awesome and
it was such a great month and i've
accumulated a few things that i really
really adored this month so I thought
we'd go through those and go through my
July favorites let's just start with
beauty as always good start with a few
skincare bit first up being the Vichy
pure eats them all what proof I make a
remover I think about mentioned this
before I've definitely mentioned
something very similar I don't know if
he/she have changed the bottle or what
exactly has changed here but it's pretty
much the exact same product that I've
had before I'm sure so on the only
things I can really use natick off my
waterproof mascara it works wonders it
is so soft on the eyes and just take
something away it's really really
brilliant Cartman bunnell which retailer
I got this wrong but i will leave the
link down below from i can get it from
it is so brilliant next up I have
switched up my skin care a little bit in
terms of night cream now this is the LMS
pro-collagen marine cream ultra rich
cream cuz i recently went into the lms
spa run new one it is gorgeous by the
way highly recommended that would also
be a favorite this month because i have
the most amazing treatments i had my
brows don't know how my eyelashes dawn
I've mentioned this before but if this
was so much fun in there and I'm
definitely going back much more often so
highly recommended but was in there they
did like a skin test thing where they
test what your skin is like how its
dehydrated or maybe if it's greasy or
oily or get your wrinkles it's really
insightful to see and they recommend a
few products and one them being that I
need to have more rich moisturizers to
add a little bit more moisture and
hydration back into my skin so they
recommended this one so i have been
using it nightly and also daily as well
it is meant to be a day cream but i love
it for nighttime as well because it just
smells so beautiful as a real at aquatic
smell it's
really fresh and beautiful so this has
been something i'm loving right now
nexon beauty is my new favorite lip
combo again I mention it in a recent
video but it seemed Aaron s lip liner in
cocoa of crazy cocoa which is sort of
beige nude beige nude a-pink's and then
on top of that I like to layer this
which is the new six lip and cheek
pencil in love which is a really
beautiful pink I just really need two
pencil sharpened that but I'm wearing it
now our lips that's line with this fill
with this and I love how soft nude pink
it is really lovely finish my new
favorite palette is the end k- palette
you've probably seen this everywhere I
know I seem so many bleakness for
tutorials I would all like to show you
this in a tutorial because it's so
brilliant it's got some gorgeous shades
and it much more smokey neutral cysts I
ran for the kind of brown and pink tone
Browns we've seen previously from the
Naked palette this one though I have
been loving for the past few weeks on my
eyes using high dirty sweet radar
mainland and also combust here as a
cliched soft blow do this in a tutorial
really soon because it's almost my new
everyday look so I'm really living at
palate for that reason and pretty short
is out if it is a little links down
below if not you'll be out in a week so
new favorite highlighter again this has
been everywhere and I almost feel silly
mentioning this but I'm going to mention
it because it is so brilliant and it's
see becca jaclyn hill highlighter in
this on rose gold highlight it's
incredible especially if you're into
strobing and highlighting at the moment
i am loving this it's the only highlight
I of use now for the past two and a half
weeks since i bought it from Sephora I
got it shipped over from Sephora that's
pretty much daily placing by I think and
it cost about 45 pounds with shipping
but it's fantastic it will last me
forever so much in there earring is
little sleep and it's like to row
is beautiful so big big big favorite
Andrew that actually realizing this is
becca as well this is the shimmering
skin Perfector for anyone that loves to
highlight beneath their foundation this
is also a fantastic product I've been
adding this over the top of my
moisturizer just to really enhance the
globe before I put on the foundation and
I really feel like it ab so much more
radiance into the skin so I've been
loving this then foundation and then
adding champagne pop and it mentioned it
before I've got champagne pop over the
top to achieve bones keeps bow down my
nose raw bone and it's just like boom
boom boom looking amazing and the last
beauty product in my dimension is this
little cutie and its seat Beauty Blender
the actual beauty blunder and I'm pretty
sure the thing that kicked it all off in
first place my name's bit of a wash
sorry I use it today i know that i love
the Real Techniques sponge and i would
highly recommend that one if you're
looking for a drugstore alternative this
one's about 22 pounds but i'll be
completely honest with you this one is
better it's definitely better just the
fact it's just a bit more pointed a bit
smaller so it fits into the creases and
what easier and just finding this is
making my makeup so much more flawless I
love it it's just the genius tool but
everyone needs whether it's this one or
another sponge just a sponge in general
definitely need for this one I live okay
everything are from beauty next up we
have some jewelry don't think i
mentioned jewelry in a while because
Thomas a dope where that much and when I
do where it's because I'm absolutely all
of it recently you may have seen a blog
post I did where I wore some gorgeous
pandora jewelry pandora is a brand I've
always really respected and really liked
but I've never really bought into it
that much but recently they brought out
the pandora rose shade which to me new
is more of a rose gold shade they call
it pandora rose i just feel like this
has completely changed up their
collection it just made it so much more
on trend it almost calls out to a
slightly different consumer than they
had before it's especially calling out
to me as a consumer
I'm loving the shade rather than silvers
and the goal to have before so I have
the gorgeous bracelet I have cook pool
of the Rings is beautiful feather ring
and one little bow and I also have the
matching pendant which with the
beautiful rose golden pandora rose
feather with little diamonds on all over
there and then it's all chained I'm
going to wearing these sue for wedding
as well and I think it'll be a beautiful
wedding jewelry a little bit of clothing
absolutely adoring the skirt this is a
real suede skirt from River Island I've
worn it in a blog post recently and now
i'm wearing it a new blog post coming up
soon it is so flattering since this a
line shape it's extremely flattering it
fits around the way so i'm also looked a
bit high waisted style beautiful suede
just if you do buy this be so careful
that you don't get anything on it and
make sure you spray it with some suede
protector because you can easily ruin it
but i absolutely adore skirt it's such a
great investment for the season as well
for the kind of suede and tan suede look
that is going on right now and next
favorite is a stunning purchase i made
from march in Paris I went into Marsh
door when I was in Paris recently and
they have the best sale on ever I mean
it's the French brand anyway I'm pretty
sure so it was at French prices and then
also sale so the prices were incredible
but everything is awesome sale here so
i'll leave the link down below for this
but this skirt is absolutely beautiful
really large floral print and then on
the inside it has this white bodycon
skirt kind of protect your dignity but
then everything else is just so
beautiful it's kind of knee length I'm
just absolutely in love with it so I'm
going to be wearing that for a wedding
with this nude blush camisole so i got
from Topshop which is also fair at this
month because it's just so easy to wear
I've got worn anything like after a
while actually so I'm really excited to
wear
lovely almost coral toned blush pink
camisole polyester I'm gonna have to be
really careful with it I think it's
around 22 pounds Oh 16 16 pounds so now
you're wearing this tucked into this
white skirt with rose gold heels and
Rose filled jewelry and it should look
really really pretty so hopefully if
I've worn these islands cert a picture
