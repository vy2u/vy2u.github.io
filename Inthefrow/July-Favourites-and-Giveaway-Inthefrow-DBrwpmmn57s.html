with it's a pretty good month and I was
looking quite a few different products I
thought I'd put together a bit of a
favorites video for you
as always I'm going to start the
skincare and beauty so first thing I was
loving was the Clarins intense samskara
now I might have mentioned this last
month of my favorites if I did I'm still
loving it
it's intense waterproof mascara I have
never really used a waterproof mascara
before and I realize now the waterproof
is the way I need to go because I have
really stubborn lashes I find that my
lashes don't kill that easily because
it's dream is straight so I need
something that's going to hold the curl
much better
so waterproof is a way to go apparently
so this is the one I tried and
absolutely loved the finish of this it
sort of lengthens as a bit thickness and
volume but also keeps your eyelashes
really really killed all day if you've
used an ALICE calluses so highly
recommend this and I love this so much I
have done the last few months now next
beauty favorite is the Estee Lauder
bronze goddess I don't like a lot of
different bronzers I like the now
silcoon of runs that like the body shop
honeycomb bronzers so it took me a few
weeks until I actually gave this a bit
of a whirl and I absolutely love it now
it's quite a deep shade for me it's
quite a sort of terracotta bronze almost
like it looks like it could almost a
little feel a little bit orangey if you
went a little bit overboard with it
however I'm finding that if I just apply
light amount let's to tap the brush into
the pan and well over your face it just
has a lovely golden glow and it's a
really lovely lovely shade so really
will awareness we're sorry about the
builds by the way they are making
complete
racket outside oh it's nothing really I
do
so hope it doesn't interrupt too much
but yes I really really like this I like
that it's got a huge mirror and it's got
a huge pan and it's just a really lovely
huge bronzing product and really really
does its job so yeah really really like
this I've got this one shade 0-1
something's that and I absolutely adore
which is a big surprise to me
it's a L'Oreal magic skin beautifier BB
cream I picked this up in America and
apparently you can get this here as well
and if not seen it myself have seen
something very similar but I'm not sure
if it's this I hope so but I'll try and
find a link for you it goes on as a
white liquid and then as you break it up
onto the skin it turns into the sort of
foundation tan color and it just seems
to go a really perfect color to me I
love the core bridge it's not too high
coverage but it really seems to discover
everything you need in a very light wash
so this is something I wish I picked up
more of actually and I highly recommend
so yeah that's in the shade medium neck
skincare favorite it's the on really lay
cream concentrate now I first heard of
this when I was doing a few photo shoots
and the makeup artist would only use
I'll release because they said that
models always preferred on beliefs and
often would not allow you to use
anything else it's also called
interesting and I also got a chance to
try it out myself properly and use every
single day and I really really really
liked it it has a few different ways you
can use this so you can use it very
lightly as a moisturizer for anything
makeup you can add a deeper coat there
the thicker coat and that will work as a
face mask or you can even take off your
makeup with this apparently if you use
it like a cleanse runner on a cotton pad
so it's got a few different uses and
it's all super natural ingredients and
it's just really really good for those
days and you wear a lot of makeup and
you just want something on your skin to
really hydrate and keep it moisturized
you've got a really heavy set of makeup
on
like that I've also been loving the
Wildrose hand cream from the body shop
and I generally love most things in the
body shop there aren't many products
I've tried there and I haven't really
loved and this is one of the ones that I
really really like I keep this by my bed
at night for my an evening routine I'll
tie all of my face products and then
I'll add this on my hands laughs and
then back to bed and it keeps my hands
super soft super nourished got a really
nice scent it's nothing too harsh
my nose okay Lucian but it just smells
really really lovely yeah very kind of
stressful rose scent about Wild Rose as
it says so yeah really really like this
a lot
try now a new body wash recently I don't
do this often because I've got quite a
lot of what I shot once I love but try
this out this is the original source
vanilla and raspberry how few smells
this it smells absolutely amazing
it's like campy nose no it's like it's
like strawberry ice cream it's just so
nice it's so loved I mean I've actually
only cut is not actually left and this
thing but it's hundred percent natural
fragrance apparently and it's just so
lovely to use and shower it's it's only
90 pound bottle as well and the last set
of beauty products are massive when it's
made these are the cream of the crop
when it comes to my favorites this time
the evader damage remedy set a hair
amazing now I tried out I think it was
the dry repair or dry remedy anyway it
was the blue bottles for the beta almost
dried out my hair more onto like it's
all tried these ones and these are
absolutely wonderful I use them in a
three part set restructuring shampoo
first I love the hair cleaner
it doesn't lather up loads but it really
cleans the hair
so now when you've done that you then
add the damage remedy intensive
restructuring treatment so this goes on
in between the shampoo and conditioner
it almost acts as a deep-clean
conditioning treatment I think just add
it on all those the hair even to the
roots all over leave it on for about
five minutes and wash it off and it
feels like you've had the most beautiful
conditioning treatment on hair it's
wonderful and then you go in with a
restructuring conditioner and decide a
coat of this I just do it from about
here down a coat of the conditioner
again I only leave it for about 30
seconds to a minute
sort of allowing it's up getting her
hair there are mics off it's just so
soft I can't tell you how soft it it's
it's so wonderful I will definitely be
buying the set when they run out these
are sort of things that'll be tell my
boyfriend do not touch these these are
mine there because it is so so brilliant
skincare and beauty own with now some of
you might realize that this month was my
birthday month it was my birthday on the
18th of July and my boyfriend got me so
many lovely lovely treats he's really
really treat Mason Thanks you don't like
to show you one or two of them because
they have been my favorite this and my
favorite things this month so first
thing he got me was this Pantone look
obviously you got it too much my hair
cream is all of lilac and it's a so cute
little present it's
that's what I want hot chocolate so hot
drinks so I love that the other thing
you've got me which is probably my
biggest biggest favorite is this Alanis
Morissette's Jagged Little Pill vinyl
I'd love to know if any of you are
allowing Somerset thumbs please leave me
a comment down below let me know if you
are cuz I'm a huge fan I'm sure a lot of
you've seen my pictures and videos I've
got a lot of smart set poster there
let's get a huge line for my set poster
over there which I got from her gig
years ago probably like 10 years ago
maybe so I'm gonna keep that forever
framed well and I also have - my scepter
- she has been one of the biggest
influences on me in a musical sense well
especially her really work anyway I'm
not as keen on the newer stuff but I
think she's fantastic
Alex got me - my set final for Jabba
Kapil like I said this album was a huge
influence on my youth I first listened
to this album when I was quite young
actually my mom got the album I think on
it first came out with 92 95 95 5 6 when
I first heard this album then I think at
the age of around 12 and I started
playing the guitar I listened to this
again and it just completely was a huge
influence on me
and my take on sort of life and love and
understanding relationships and the
traffic tribulations and I don't know it
just it was a big eye-opener for me and
a massive musical influence so ever
since then I've been a huge fan not
heard this album where have you been I'm
sure most people with her checklist pill
it's just the most incredible album so
many amazing songs thank you Alex for
the most amazing present and got to
frame this when I get myself a vinyl
frame and get on the wall except so I
can keep it in pristine condition anyway
music run over of what else have you got
I love these little short Caesar from
smoochy and yeah look at that pretty no
it's just so cool so colourful super
easy I have been finding with the warm
weather we've been having
I just might watch somewhere what should
I wear reach and reach these most days a
super Covey's
comfortable and they just look so cool
I'm just been walking around town and
then with a little vest on or a little
like white tee talk to another just
awesome so I really love those and when
you about 20 pounds and a top I wore in
one of my last videos L'Oreal hair video
was this top from a qaq scene I love
this now this is quite pricey this is 55
pound I think and it's a little crop
it's like a little home that crap it
goes like this and it's hard to show you
and it's got a zip pop the back and then
it cuts out mmm cut out the front body
it's so flattering and I'm just really
liking the cropped halter neck look at
the moment it's a really high net look
it's just something really flattering
about it so I really really like this
one
so I desire I really really like it and
another product I love is this bomber
this is from Miss Canada got I can tell
her I just came in with Ramona's look at
those colors how vibrant is Sam and not
printed it it's just to know it's
something that I couldn't imagine this
kind of selling and as soon as I saw it
I was like I love it it's just so cool
I'll be honest it's a little bit warm
right now to wear this because it's
neoprene and I just wore it out there
and was like whoa I need to get this
jacket off or when it cools down a
little bit it's so nice the shape and
the face so cool and gets about 25 to 30
pounds and last but certainly not least
my brand new handbag how cute is this
this is a Gracia camera bag if you may
know I had to take back microphone she
I'm so gonna it was really upsetting I'm
going to give it back to Selfridges
because the pink dye in the bag with
turning blue in the rain
so whenever rain drops let's hit it it
was rich go blue blue blue so I'd get my
bag home be like why is my pink black
bag blue it looked like it was covered
in ink
oh god first time happen and they'll let
you had a mini heart
and then it luckily selfishness with
fantastic about it and I let me take it
back and apologize I said they were as
baffled as I was about why I was
happening that's why I lost my I'm back
I just fell in love with this as soon as
I saw it now I realize some people might
not want the camera back as a hand bat
but I like the idea that I could take
around my little camera but I'm filming
on now around with me at all times I'd
always have a camera so those moments
when you really want to take a really
fantastic photo I'd always have my
camera on me so it opens up and it's got
a camera section this is heavy opens up
and it's got compartments certainly
what's have my purse my cosmetics and
then I have my camera in the other side
and then it's got a space here some more
things it's based on hand side so it's
got so much room for everything I need
it keeps it very compartmentalize
compartmentalize it's great it's about a
hundred eighty pounds but you can get
15% off the bag from my bag it's all the
description below anyway but it's from
my bag and you get 50% off with my code
