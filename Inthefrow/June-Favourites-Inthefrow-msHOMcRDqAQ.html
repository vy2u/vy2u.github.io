again and I have been away for three
weeks as you may have known and I've
been dying to start filming some things
again about so many ideas for new videos
I wanted to film and it's so nice to sit
down from the camera and chat with you
all again so hello how are you
the first thing I am so blonde look how
blonde I've gone the American weather
i'm a chlorine and the sea and
everything else has totally stripped the
color from my hair pretty much and me to
fade much much faster than it normally
would so it's turned to a very kind of
blond to pink ombre can i think you're
not quite like it to be honest
and i used the most amazing shampoo and
conditioner so it's feeling amazing at
the moment second of all I'm thank you
so much to everyone who is subscribing I
have subscribed since the beginning
since 18 months ago so since I first
started this channel and hi to anyone
who's just joined I can't believe I hit
seventy thousand subscribers that is
just amazing and I was just so simply
but thank you and hi and welcome to the
channel
so yes let's get in to the June
favorites
now I also been away for three weeks so
this is kind of things I kind of like
before I went away and the things I
loved during the time I was away what
starts with Beauty will start with
Beauty first thing I've been loving this
month is the instant age erase eye this
is from Maybelline yeah Maybelline and
this is a miracle worker I've got on now
and it's just so so good with this kind
of tothis car it's like a spongy top you
would twist it throughout more in
today's sponge add it to your face gonna
dab it around your eyes and what not and
this acts as kind of like a brush
applicator so you can add it on deck
quick quickly well it's up to you you
can quickly blend if you want to I
foundation at the top or are they sell
foundation
and it's so good apps a little bit so
I'll be buying this again I got this in
the color light go light on the same
kind of notice that I picked this up in
the airport and I've already fallen
totally in love with it it's a Mac prep
and prime it is a very yellow toned I
went for light boost a few different
shapes but I want to like this very
yellow heat owned by its addict into
triangle kind of shape under my eyes
then I use my Sigma e-40 brush to blend
it through and it just adds so much of a
nice highlight and conceals a little bit
and it's not too soft weights they are
heavy it's just so light and brightening
and boosting and again this is something
I will definitely buy as soon as it's
ran out and loved I also picked this up
in the airport and I've used all this
for my holiday I absolutely adore it
it's the Tom Ford brow sculptor I got it
in chestnut because I like quite brown
brows so on one side you've got the
applicator that you kind of brush into
your eyes it's a waxy kind of finish so
super easy to apply and stays all day
then got like a spoolie on the end to
brush through and what's really cool is
if you twist off the bottom this comes
out and this is a sharpener I'm not
useless yeah with it scared to because
it's so expensive but you can sharpen
the end so it's super fine and you can
get the superfine application at every
single time now this was around thirty
pounds but I saw it in the airport and I
thought it looks so cute and so sweet
and I always wanted to try Tom Ford
products so I treat myself and I don't
regret it I really love it on the same
line of brows you might have seen me use
a few times I might have mentioned it
before but it's a benefit gimme brow
this over the top of any brows even
brows haven't been sorted or had
anything put onto them is a miracle
worker
it's so good just after just enough
product to your eyebrows pushes some
through keep some cell all day it
doesn't ask that a little bit for 10 so
love that too
I think you'll see me use a lot and a
lot of my makeup videos because I really
adore it is the Elizabeth Arden BB cream
this is in the shade light I think this
is the first shade on number one number
while light I use this a like I said so
feel free just go back to any of my old
videos and you'll see me using it but it
just makes it super chewy and bright and
refreshing looks your face this this
number one shade it's fairly dark I can
usually get away with it when I've got
it but I'm going on but I really really
love the finish and I this is my second
Bowl I keep buying it so I love that
next bronzer this from the got a shop
now I'm a huge Photoshop fan and I used
to buy these years ago then I got onto
other bronzers recently I picked up
another one this is in shade and blonde
and it's one of their honeycomb bronzers
can't really see but it's in a honeycomb
star shape it just adds such a beautiful
color to face first off cough I love to
use it for contouring and all over the
face and I just love the finish it gives
it's it's a matte shade it's not
shimmery it just you might see me use my
last video the zoeva brushes they come
in a set a few in a little leather bag
which is adorable in the first place but
these my favorite four out of there I
have completely converted over to so
either brushes now and after being a big
a real setting as far still love the
Real Techniques brushes but these are
just winners so I absolutely adore silk
finish brush and use that as my
foundation application I love they looks
sheer cheek brush I use that for my
blusher it's perfect I love they look
soft definer as an all-over I shadow
color I should brush and blend and then
the look of petit crease is fantastic if
you've got smaller eye sockets like I
have and you want to add a really
precise crease or eyeliner or on dry
it's just
so I highly recommend if you're looking
for some new brushes invest in the
silver set I love it so much
then we've got mascara probably showing
you my entire face now but this is my
mascara from Clarins a waterproof
intense mascara this is so brilliant
I have lashes that stick forward they
don't do anything else so now I just
tried this one day kill my lashes put
this on never thought of using
waterproof mascara for put this on and
it keeps them so beautifully spread open
and wide eyed and super black it's the
most beautiful mascara I've ever used
obviously with it being waterproof it's
so hard to get off so I highly recommend
I haven't got it here because I've used
the entire bottle I need to buy a new
one I highly recommend the body shop oil
cleanser and waterproof removing
cleanser thing it's or it's an inner
bottle and it's an oil cleanser it's the
only thing I've got about five or six
different cleansers it's the only one
that will take this off or waterproof
mascara it's brilliant but overall it's
just an excellent mascara if you're
looking for a new one and you've got
Minister eyelashes if you give them a
curl and put this on I'll keep them
curled all day then something I bought
in America actually and it's firmly
become a massive favorite I wish I
bought four or more and it's a Victoria
Secret lotion hydrating body lotion this
is in the flavour or scent secret crush
it smells a bit like watermelon sweets
and I'm a massive watermelon famine this
is just amazing I buy a lot of lotions
and I think oh I'll put them by my bed
I'll put them on before I get in bed
blah blah now and again I will but most
the time I don't become too lazy however
this is just so nice I've been applying
it every single day and I also bought
four body mists to go with it so I'll
pull this all over and I'll put the body
mist on and a smell like a goddess so
yeah so I really wish I'd bought more
talking Victoria Secrets actually I
bumped into a little of the girl they're
called Audrey here
me from Instagram which was amazing
because she lived in San Francisco and I
was in San Francisco Victoria's Secret
store and she asked me if I was in throw
off Instagram like oh hello so that was
awesome so if you're watching Audrey hi
game it was so nice to meet you and
thank you again for helping us that's if
a beauty might be happy to that and next
favorite you'll have seen in a recent
primer Khalid it but it says Primark
playsuit I just wore this to death on
holiday and it was family a favorite it
was just so comfortable easy to wear not
to showing perfect for the temperature
and even if you're in the UK this is
perfect to wear so this will sell this
it was about six pounds and it was
amazing so I loved that next favorite
are these mom Jean ma these mom jeans
from Urban Outfitters these were pretty
pricey I think they were like 50 pounds
card number now I think I closed my mind
when I bought them that's out god I love
these I never I never wanted to get on
the bandwagon of these jeans oh when I
tried them on and these fit me like a
dream they were like a strange size 24
or something they fit me like a dream I
love them little turn up to the bottoms
perfect length to wear with little
flashes super comfortable flattering
although mom jeans so these are from the
bgg range I have an outfit if I leave
Liebherr find them but I absolutely
adore these lastly I think I need to
give a big shout out its agraphia and
this backpack well I use this for three
weeks when I was traveling and it was
such a brilliant traveling backpack
the color was brilliant I got so many
comments on this everywhere I went to
things that went through the mud the
dirt and God knows what other materials
with me it still looks really really
good and the ladder is broken
beautifully so it's super soft leather
now
and I'll still be using it alone as I
said massive love for graffia last but
not least I ordered these and it was
probably February I'm not joking
they arrived three weeks ago the day you
plant the around the day I went on
holiday so I couldn't even get to wear
them but I tried them on oh my god and
you might guessed it it's a Jeffrey
Campbell skies yeah there might not be
everyone's cup of tea but I love these
shoes ever since I saw them all over
tumblr I was like I had to get some just
saw that everywhere I sent people on
missions try find them I can't find them
finally Seoul struck was like to sell
them and I ordered salt but they took so
long to arrive from America these cost
me 30 pound and customs charges plus the
shoe was probably around hundred pound
when you change the back seat 130 so in
fact these are pulling cheaper to buy
from America than the I hear exam pretty
sure places will be saw these for 150 so
it's up to they might take a little bit
longer but yeah 32 pound custom charge I
think it was cuz I know people probably
ask them they're just so comfortable we
might not look it but you've got such a
massive heel and massive platform that
you've only got a very small incline and
this keeps you your foot in and you're
not gonna fall out of them so they're
just super comfortable and awesome my
very last favorite is going to be this
