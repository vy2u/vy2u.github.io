favorites video is now the end of June
so I can go through all the products
that are absolutely loving for the month
we've got a few pieces to get through so
I'll get started first up you might
notice my hair's looking slightly
different it's quite dark here
underneath it's a bit like to here and
bottom too lighter is because tomorrow
I'm going into my hair redyed as I
always do every nine weeks and the salon
however I was sent this product from a
company called Maria nila maria nila
really gorgeous packaging really really
sweet and I was really intrigued by it
when I first saw it but I have a policy
where I don't put anything else on my
hair other than shampoos and
conditioners I definitely not put color
on there this product is a vivid violet
color refresh and it's for those people
who like lilacs or they may have a white
blonde and then I go a little bit more
purple but this is eight Worth's
non-permanent color so I'd imagine it
Polly lasts about four washes so what I
did yesterday I wash my hair and it was
really quite light a Lacerta picture
here of how my hair looks right before I
died this all I did with my hands yes
with bare hands I added that all over my
hair I mean I was only really
experimenting with it so I didn't go all
out and really make sure every piece was
coated which is why it's a little bit
almost a little bit patchy now but I
think that if I've done this properly it
would look so bright I mean look at that
colour there this is like literally my
usual colour so if you're a blonde and
you're looking to go a bit more like my
colour is the first time I'm able to
recommend something that might actually
help you so that's quite fine for me so
this is by maria nila i'll leave a link
below next up I have a skincare
favourite and at the moment I am
obsessed with using exfoliating parotias
I found that my skin is ten times better
than it was even maybe five six weeks
ago I feel like it's so much clearer in
fact at the moment I think
one blemish shall start moment it is
really helped to clear my skin because I
got into a bit of a routine when I'd
wash my face I don't think oh yeah
that's most of this makeup half it's
time I put cream on and obviously I was
locking in so much dirt into my pores I
hadn't got out so now I always do a
double exfoliate so I make sure that I
almost take off my makeup my take off a
bit of the base then I'll apply a
product over the top I use an
exfoliating brush to go over the top and
then I'll wash all of that off so it's
almost like a double cleanse so two
products that I'm really enjoying are
from Michael Todd this is the skin
defender eh-eh-eh cream facial cleanser
it was a really lovely smooth cleanser
that I add all over the face on top of
my makeup really really massage it into
there and that just really helps to kind
of break down makeup as well as really
enhancing the skin and just you know
it's breaking down all that dirt and
really giving it a good refresh so I
really really like this product to the
moment so after I've put that on I also
use a sonic clear brush I like this it's
nice bright orange ecology of other
colors as well and with this I literally
turn it on
vibration and just work it gently cuz
this can be quite fairly a ting I mean
also Alex loves it I can you think him
use this all the time constantly
stealing it from my beauty corporate and
he uses it too he puts a little bit
harder though because I feel like his
skin isn't quite sensitive is mine so
just play around with it depending on
how sensitive your skin is so I will
just turn on the vibration and then in
little circles very lightly on top of
the skin and work it into the skin but
honestly these things a moment are
changing my life just exfoliating
Britain in general but this one it's a
really really fantastic one I've been
loving it especially with this is a Giro
- they're both from Michael Todd again
I'll leave all the links below let's
continue with Beauty Tam San Tropez was
a brand
I never went towards for a long time I
felt it was overhyped
I felt that whenever people talked about
it they said it was really orange and it
just wasn't quite right for them so
those little bit turned off until I got
this bottle this is the self tan Express
one hour tab in this turquoise bottle
lists about 33 pounds from boots running
in the drugstore but at the moment boots
have 11 pound offices currently about 22
pounds so if you can go and get one this
is amazing make sure you have a mitt
because you will need a mint it's quite
a dark mousse pie all over your body you
can leave this on for an hour if you
want a light time two hours from eating
sounds three hours of dark I'll be
honest with you and I apply this all
over in the morning
stick my lonesome chill out do work
probably leave it on for about six or
seven hours then I'll have a shower and
I just find my skin is glowing much
darker much more time it's kind of time
I love that kind of really dark all of
you turn and I'd probably say it will
last you about 5-6 days before you feel
like you really need to go again this is
a bad example I don't have any tan on
right now it's definitely come off but I
definitely to go in again and this one
is one I have been living favorites
enter the month or give this a mention
yes these are very very expensive and I
know when I'm not you want before you're
all like why is that so expensive yes it
is but it's also beautiful so if you do
love Tom Ford scents
I'm sure you'll love this one too this
one's coaster syrup odd
50 mil it is beautiful I think this
would work for women and for men I press
that's why I think that's why I love it
so much because it has quite a unisex
fragrance to it but it's quite I
remember when I speaking to Sam and Nick
Chapman pixie were about this and we
were describing a sexy man smell really
gorgeous scent I absolutely adore it's
so summery and bright also quite it is
quite thought that really sexy man smell
I love it
female beauty products of dimension I
found this again in my beauty cupboard
my beauty drawer it's a cheap to chic
swish and pop blush it fits loved by
Charlotte Tilbury and I should always
remember to keep this somewhere where
it's accessible because it's most
definitely my favorite blush ever it's
just I've got it on now actually it's
just so natural it can be built up when
I first saw this I thought on we're
gonna show up on my cheeks that much but
it does and it's gifts most natural
flush it's gorgeous I just love this
blush so by far my favorites and I'm
gonna take this home this weekend and
use this on my mom for her wedding day
makeup definitely it's beautiful and one
last beauty product is a Mac strobe
cream
I think I saw Gaby chatting about this
velvet ghost and I was like you know
what I'm gonna get the girl because I
really love the illuminated Juhi look at
the moment but it is great to add over
your moisturiser underneath your
foundation just to really brighten up
the skin awesome eliminations for
radiance and just you know perk it up
similarly the Becca shimmering enhancer
and difficult that's a very very similar
product I say that one's a little bit
more shimmery but this is a really
beautiful product I very much like I've
got three fashion pieces this time first
up Lou Taylor Morris stronger glasses
these ones I have these on my Instagram
and so many if you were like oh my
goodness
those glasses are incredible and it's
these from Taylor Morris really large
purple and these literally looking
through these is by looking at my
Instagram feed it's like a lilac filter
if you follow my Instagram in fro you
know a lot of my pictures have a very
like almost a lilac filter over
very very subtle these frames give such
a lilac Sheen to everything I love the
shape of them the fact that they're
quite slim almost still on my face but
really large and statement glasses and
they just yeah beautiful maybe sort of
robust frames as well it's not
tortoiseshell it's almost like paint
strokes of purple and something else I
picked up recently for the gym or for
bark or actually that I go to I've
mentioned before that is a favor every
single month it's awesome if you're in a
London area or near old early edge in
Manchester push on the website have a
little look I absolutely adore it so I
have got a few new tops to wear for
parkour recently and they're just a
little sports bra tops from Mike I just
find these fit me really well I always
signs up though that usually would go
for an excess these are so small because
I find that quite they are very fitted
and very very small this one
particularly I love with a huge night
logo and it's different small night
ticks it depends if you like to be bold
and brash for your logos or much more
subtle but they fit in the exact same
way and I just found that I feel quite
confident in them when I'm working gal
it's just yeah and last but not least I
have to include these in all honesty I
brought them yesterday I haven't worn
them yet but I have been searching for
these shoes how long have I been
searching for this year's babe would you
say four months six months it's been a
long time I'm a searching for these from
very long time I decide this over tumblr
on his Carson thing and it is these the
Aqua Zara well I don't actually know the
actual name of these but the ones I
looking for with a cursor at Christie
flats you may have seen them they were
black leather with the lace ups and they
had a gold trim around here I even
ordered them from America and they were
going to be delivered sometime this
month but yesterday I was in Selfridges
and I saw that it brought out a slightly
different path in a Navy suede with
these silver rivets
off stood I guess and the silver heel
and I thought you know save getting of
America and pain all that shipping
charges and everything in the black
instead go for navy it's a little bit
more summary it'll go with so many items
I've got and I was just absolutely over
the moon that I could actually get them
in my size these have been so filled out
everywhere literally I have scoured the
internet for lots and lots and lots to
find them done I finally got them
they're more pricey shoe if you're into
your premium shoes like I am and buying
more luxury shoes then you might really
really like these of course they're not
really a budget shoe but I will try
actually leave some down below of where
you can get some really amazing Jews
because he can my Topshop at the moment
office are doing jeeps of these I mean
these are the Aqua Terra once so these
are much more pricey but there are some
brilliant jeeps at that I'll leave them
