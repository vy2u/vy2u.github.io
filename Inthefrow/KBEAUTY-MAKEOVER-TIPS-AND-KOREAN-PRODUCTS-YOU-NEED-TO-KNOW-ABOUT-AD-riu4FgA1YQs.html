I'm really really excited to show you
this actually the first time I've ever
featured anything Korean beauty kv2 eyes
on my channel this is going to be like a
big discovery video and when I talk abt
tips a little bit kind of history we're
all kind of came from originated from
I'm going to go through some credible
Kay beauty products as well and show you
how I've got this overall very fresh
flawless look absolutely in love with it
I think my complexion and skin looks so
fresh and light if I'm not cakey it is
not weighed down it just looks so fresh
and natural and that is what Kay beauty
is all about if I perfected beautiful
skin Korean beauty consumers are
literally some of the biggest in the
world they almost have a social
obligation to go out looking the
absolute best it's almost like you're
expecting they want to look flawless and
perfected with beautiful luminous
radiant skin and so they often have this
like sixteen step skincare regime they
do I mean I often have quite a few steps
and no way I'm going to do 16 steps
you're also going to have the different
types of cleansers and toners and
exfoliators and moisturizers plumping
things complexion Corrections and color
correctors and everything else it just
becomes this huge amount of different
layers so in this video is long when it
kind of talks with a few products that
have been created for this need and the
kind of combined quite a few these
different types of steps into just a few
just to really cut back the whole regime
and make it much more kind of
streamlined and just other sectors which
is the key products and let's just say
I've been using products and I love them
so carry about those but I think when it
comes to K beauty just over the years
it's become so much more popular and it
kind of broke into the kind of Western
world and I've been seeing it everywhere
recently about really flawless beautiful
luminous skin probably like their skin
to almost look like milk or like a pearl
or an egg even it's been described as
it's very extremely smooth I mean when
you look at this your parents of an air
you can see if I suspected so that's
kind of what now going for so I put this
whole base and look together today
using all KBT products come on which
tell you all about them I am in love I
love this whole look yeah so let's get
right into this before I show you how I
create this makeup look I wanted to show
you all this from products I used to
clean the skin double cleanse and prep
the skin before the makeup so the
products when I'm talking to you today
are all from Korean beauty brand Borean
it Borean really are experts in the
whole Korean beauty field from a
creative initially in 2007 kind of
introduced Korean Beauty more to the
European market but it's also pressed
for Korean women who just want to really
reduce the number of steps they're
putting into the whole skincare regime I
mean I'll be talking a lot later about
CC cream which is kind of like the hero
product of the Borean so bestseller
until the products have really helped
the brand find same as well as a BB
cream again which I will show you later
a few C products are just fantastic
products that need to be known so much
more and yet both hero products of the
Boreum brand so now we're showing you
those later dramatic ahead and the
Korean culture it's about respect and
betraying yourself in the most beautiful
way possible so the chance I you won't
see that many Korean women leaving the
house without much makeup on or at least
a great base so they have a 16th step
process when it comes to skincare so
many different processes and layers that
they put on to really help the
appearance of the skin so if Mauryan
have come up with almost like a
four-step process that includes film
ingredients and Asian skincare
techniques that could have honed down a
lot of these steps into a few to really
make the whole process so much quick at
what just effective so starting off with
the black cleansing oil they have
charcoal and sign it so it's a very
purifying oil when it comes to double
cleansing it's all about using an oil
first wiping it away and then using a
water-based cleanser to kind of finish
the full clean and with all the
beautiful looks that we tend to use now
especially in the Western world it's all
about really making sure the skin is
cleaned all impurities are really
removed all you do is just add a little
bit of on to your fingertips
massage it onto your drive face and then
you can use water to write this away
look the next products that I want to
tell you about is the konjac sponge I've
seen quite a few of things recently and
I'm absolutely obsessed with them I love
the
he's amazing like an Asian type plant
they contain bamboo charcoal as well and
this is very gentle exfoliating sponge
but they're wonderful when you've got
something all of your safe like a
cleanser you can really get in there
with this and massage your swing away
get rid of all impurities everything
else off the face and a little it comes
with strings you can hang it up and let
it drive because this goes almost like
rock solid when it dries and then if you
leave it on to me for taps like three
minutes sort of keep squeeze it under a
cap this goes nice and sticky but it's
such a great little tool and really
obsessive these I think they are
fantastic especially for using with
cleansers so after the black cleansing
oil I then went in with the double noose
gentle cleansing foam as you can see in
the cuts wave I added two pumps of this
to my hand and then again it's massage
it onto dry skin you can leave this on
the skins like 30 seconds if you want to
before then wiping it away with water
again you can do that or like I did you
can use a sponge it just very gently you
have to really real part of this but it
just helps remove all the products this
just really refines the skin's texture
overall after I use it my skin felt so
much more smooth so cleanse I mean since
a water-based cleanser as well so those
two used together our kind of perfect
double cleanse overall then after that
the ocean sank
concentrated lotion for instant moisture
this in the Western world I would see is
almost like a very hydrating toner you
guys are my 3 to 5 drops of this onto
your palms while not the product and
then just Pat them push the product into
the skin
this is like a boost of hydration and
concert back into the skin it just prep
the skin ready for moisturizer over the
top so before I tell you about the
moisturizers I'm going to go right back
to the beginning when I had no makeup on
so I can start the whole routine from
the nice driver so here is me from the
past then my face is all cleansed as I
just showed you so now I'm going to get
straight in to my makeup but these are
this is what you've gotten all of them
so I thought I feel so excited to sort
of show you all of this look I've never
done I don't think I've ever use any Kay
beauty products ever before my channel
this is really exciting for me ok so
after my double cleansing routine and
obviously my kind of hydrating toning
routine as well going to
into some moisture so this is the Borean
bamboo clamp slepe smells amazing
they're like a hydrating nourishing
plumping steps for skin after you
cleanse and if I've got a little bit
more hydration back into the skin with
the ocean sand compliance your face
every single day and night and you can
or use it as an amazing base for makeup
so that's what we're going to do today
it smells so fresh it's like a really
fresh like sorbet kind of feel that's
how I'm kind of mentioning it my
students are soaking up like that I can
barely feel right now but my skin feels
more plump and like rich enough it's
full of juice so now we can move on to
the makeup so this is the abhorrent glow
cream ox n so it's illuminating face
cream ultra region effect the idea of
this is that kind of like blurs the skin
offers a really incredible complexion
right before you then add more layers on
top so I'm going to apply this with this
thing is and it's a so pearly really
pearlescent formula so I mean I can see
that already actually it only looks like
the light is bouncing off of it
you surprised me you think it tips you
could apply it with a brush if you
really wanted to but I think for this
the hums are perfect to be honest it's
got such a lovely smooth and soft
texture feels amazing so smooth and
beautiful and amazing makeup base I can
tell just from the texture okay next in
the regime is the Borean CC cream this
is in the shade clear for me it's a high
definition reason space cream Susan got
a nice Drive it's going to enhance the
overall look as the skin it's going to
reduce any imperfections it is going to
really help to make the colors and tones
and the skin much more flawless and
perfected over all through this and if I
use it on my fingertips again it's
really easy
the cool thing about this as well is
that the color it comes out almost like
a white cream and then when you start to
plant on some skin it's almost like the
color starts to adapt to the shades and
a luminosity of the face I'm going to
come up
I'm asking to feels really smooth a
really soft feels like it's just really
perfecting that top layer of the skin as
I'm applying it it's got a very lovely
subtle nude shade to it and I feel
really happy just with that it's just
added the most like subtle changes to my
complexion and now the final perfecting
base layer that's going to be the Borean
B because M so mostly cream to the cramp
because I'm ENGLISH BB cream since the
BB cream which is won so many awards for
it boring it's like their star product
and also be beat and new to be between
nude they're both about that very
natural glowing beautiful finish
I actually had the pleasure of speaking
with B co-founder of the Dorian's castle
in Burundi on the phone the other day
just to ask you a little bit more about
K butene how a Lauren came to be and it
was so interesting and so inspiring
actually exactly I was telling me that
Korean women do like to go and have like
lots of some treatments done and
microdermabrasion it's all about really
trying to perfect the skin at all times
but as these ladies were bent to go
straight back to work in their face B I
mean as you guys do I know he's had
treatments done as I know as well your
face is really bright red and it's quite
insight when you want to go home and how
yourself just for like a day into it all
goes down again
so skin sensitivities for healed and
it's not the right time to put on
foundation so the BB cream kind of came
from the requirements from the Korean
women it's needed something that they
could wear back to work that was
breathable and quite weightless and we
just really helped with the color
correcting and make them look really
flawless again so it's a first BB cream
in the European market which i think is
amazing and yet not see with the
skincare benefits inside of it currently
skincare and makeup hybrid perfect for
models models to listen love it as its
kind of monster izing and also give all
the benefits of makeup on top so it is
one of those like epic products really
I'm going to show you how this applies
I'm going to use the BB cream nude and
apply some to my fingers I'm going to
apply it in my hands and then probably
use my brush afterwards this is a
wonderful shade for me
you can barely see it just what your
looks or so so that's well actually I
feel like using your hands with it
really actually benefits it as well I
feel it almost warms up the product so
I'm going to do this apply one left
layer with a brush some of the more
coverage in the center of my face I'm
just going to use a brush for that any
kind of foundation brush to help me
little gooses down you can you see that
glow that has kind of coming out of skin
but yet it doesn't look oily like I have
a lot of other products I use that get
this kind of look but still look quite
oily and I've got to mattify them down
with powders and take away that shine
where's this just looks radiant like I
probably wouldn't powder this personally
with my skin too I mean my skin is
usually quite dry to normal so what the
overall effect it looks flawless my skin
looks completely smooth and like the
complexion looks amazing
okay so we're going to kind of finish
off the face this is amazing I love
concealers like this that have this
little sponge applicator I've already
been using that size little bit dirty
and and you just pop it up at the end
and add small product into the top and
as you know I like a lot of concealer so
just feel so soft when it goes on these
any kind of blending sponge or your
fingertips or a brush I was like eating
a little mini sponge this has helped to
lighten and brighten the under eyes get
rid of any kind of extra dark circles
and this point I just like a little bit
closer just so you can actually see the
effects on my skin right so this is the
texture and parents on my skin at this
point are really smooth you can see is
luminosity like that looks so lovely
cool is great it's now catching it isn't
dryness it just looks really radiant
this is finish off the whole face now
when you use a copper glow this is
really beautiful it comes with a little
sponge like this that you can use
against pat on the products which you
can do it's almost like a coppery
product now you could use all of the
face I think what this kind of call that
any other part is more luminosity and
raise it from skin or I'm going to do is
to all those that in and out a little
bit more to kind of like these areas if
it almost bronze up a little bit I'll
help this to warm up the skin a little
bit as well adding a little bit more now
just on to my cheekbone area just for
out I usually apply that bronzer and
this is a very natural Sheen my it's a
cutest little product I love it look how
rich that look from skin again it's
really range it when you swallow just
remove it mark allergic so I want to use
the pink perfect blush look how cute
this is
remove this little section it's keeping
everything I'll locked in sight stick
this back on and then all the pink will
start to seep through into little sponge
so cute just at what cut the ring came
back in and Alex assert that my my skin
my makeup looks gorgeous natural so
there you go what a compliment
do you know what I'm going to go over my
eyelids actually with a bit more of
copper glow just to make this my can
look once we're really natural but still
have a few little bits that I like to do
with my makeup so it's going to take a
little brush and just sweep that over a
little a bit more just fill up it more
intensive color it still looks really
really natural it's gonna like blend up
and a lot ciborium product going to show
you is the Rose infusion lip oil going
to a little bit too much
it's very pink port and kissable help
okay I'm just going to quickly go off
camera to my brow part in a bit of
mascara and maybe I'll line my lips a
little bit more shape as you know me and
I'll be right back with you I am
absolutely in love with this look I have
not seen my skin look at this fresh and
this natural in so long
we're just a few different products I
like I said a spot a bit of mascara and
brown gel through my eyebrow so nothing
to talk sectors much more natural and a
little tiny bit of line around my lips
because I'm trying to define the shape
or a bit more by just with the oil on
there and I mean the fact that Alex
notice as well how natural it look is I
mean it's a big compliment it just shows
how good these products are how much
more freshness get looks in comparison
to normal so I'm honestly about blowing
away I've said I've been using a few
these products for a while kind of
testing them out but you're going to
pull them all together and bring them
