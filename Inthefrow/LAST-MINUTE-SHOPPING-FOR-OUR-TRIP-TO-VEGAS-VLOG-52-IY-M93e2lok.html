one is west one is north so 3 well me in
the to east and west are going to be
slightly similar temperatures got Vegas
in Florida then we're going to Chicago
so it's gonna be freezing cold so and
also I wanna tear loads of shoots out

projects to do so there's a lot to pack
for so I've signed it to make a bit of a
notes itinerary thing that's kind of
like my dressing itinerary so day-by-day

plane journeys were taken so this is a
really gorgeous really lovely quality
cream knit from UM these eyelet head
Baker relaxed range which are just
incredible the so
all soft and beautiful there is like a
matching top to these but it wasn't in

like a cute little pink outfit and then
my Cloe backpack and I'm also taking
this guy as well but there are a couple
of little bits I'm thinking of taking
fawn plane but like do I really really

pulls into a little bow it's you know
software that is really slouchy easy top
these all have sample labels on them

sneak peek right here Baker they're not

think it's a full like new relaxed range
which is perfect for like loungewear
lounging and obviously like airports if
you travel a lot perfect for it kind of
skating on the plane so these go with
that top it's a full silky blue perch
