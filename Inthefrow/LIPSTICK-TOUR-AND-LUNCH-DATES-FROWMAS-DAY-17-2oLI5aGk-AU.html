stay 17 I'm on the way out now I'm going
out for a brunch with Sammy Amelia and
some lovely ladies from Victor Ralph and
Weiss out so it's going to be a bit of a
liftoff kind of beauty lunch which were
lovely
I am super late I need to go really
quickly also I'm wearing this brand new
necklace which I'm totally in love where
this is from Kat muffin I've had one of
her rings before that I absolutely loved
it's got this as well and I'm in love
with it I've actually known a few hours
but I had a great sort of dinner brunch
chap it wasn't really even a meeting it
was just like a cap shop with the girls
from my son Victor Ralph with Sammy as
well sorry so nice I love something as
you know so it's always good to see
funny come into my office authority of
at work but my office is awful like this
is kind of behind the scenes of my
office before it gets cleared up so I've
got all these new samples yes I'm gonna
put this on the minute I think I will
listen this is one of those happy plugs
and speakers how adorable is that and
it's cool because he can change the
colors of these as well so you can have
like different colors this would be a
pretty good Christmas present actually
for someone really lovely got that from
Topshop if I need to put all this stuff
away new some poles
you should tie up this what is going on
here I've got all these new samples down
here to put away and leave I also I'm
going to reduce down this because it's
only got a bit crazy again like they fit
in before now they're not and I'm not
liking it and they're all these well so
I need to get putting things away in
their places
gonna find places for everything so it's
nice and neat and then when I come
through a few everything then it's all
in the right place but the moment to
spare the mess and it makes me feel a
bit like ah hours later and I'm almost
done this looks so much nicer with legs
and my beautiful Maison Margiela candle
which is the beach walk one so it's so
much of that and perfume I was showing
you the day it's my fave I know this man
ah nice nice nice and now just got only
a few samples left and then look how
nice oh this is so much better like
they're all actually in and push back
now so I can actually see everything
this was pink lipsticks in it which is
ridiculous that's how many pink
lipsticks I have and I've got my nudes
red corals and purples and then a few
nail brands just cuz I like it in
shellac so I recently threw away a lot
of nail varnish II sort of super old and
now these are my super favorite ones
then I've got some this is all a
beautiful girl on pieces I need to try
out and review and in here there's a few
of the pieces I need to review as well
second of my mic to be reviewed area and
then everything else is super nice again

made of it kind of a roast chicken

sweet potato mash and broad beans and
gravy
