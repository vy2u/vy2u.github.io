hear me then I - but also saying that we
went out at like half 10 and we got home

longest ever shopping Damien ants have
ever done which an argue once it way it
went smoothly we stayed calm we took it
in our stride and it wasn't as busy as I
thought it would be
did you not think I thought it'd be more
hellish wasn't too bad so yes so you may
have seen we were into your because we
were doing a bit of a shopping trip up
and down one Street to try and find a
beautiful wallet cuz I decided I wanted
to get a wallet so we looked in Burberry
looked in Fendi and then I was like
let's just go and look at Dior cuz I
wanted to look at the watches and we
found the most beautiful wallet and Alex
bought it for me but crazy but you know
that's all things it's not Christmas I
don't even think they sell Dior online
so if I can find a link to what I've got
I'll try and link it down below so you
can have a peek but otherwise you'll
have to wait till after Christmas to see
it but it's so what we're going to do
for dinner
I really want a picado with crap on
toast
jello just agreed Alex doesn't want that
what do you want I don't know pasta dish
I think we might make like a pasta bake
with cheese and tuna and what else we
say about the satyr oh we could just
order pizza no we're not altering in
we're not oh dude we've got so much for
you know and Arden we're gonna support
my feet so tired let's put a little bit
of well is it a bit this sniffing fab
stiletto fix I've found in my home in my
drawers and the site this looks good and
it's actually really good it's like
peppermint tea I just like rubbed it
into my feet they feel so much better
now

I've got things for my Nana and my dad
I've got Alex's Christmas present sorted
kind of it was a good day just had a
very lovely surprise package through
from skinned Iceland they do amazing
skincare and it's a biscuit tears box
I love these biscuits so much like we do
loads of some types like some common
least liked in this woman planned are
boxes and they're probably my favourite

it up first yeah that's good
it's all ready check this out looks
really good her the pine nuts cheese and
spinach so it's actually the sundae now
I didn't end up finishing the vlog from
yesterday I don't know why you must have
got into some sort of food coma and just
wanted to chill out on sofas and go to
bed pretty much so that was it
so I thought that today I would roll the
two together and you could have a full
weekend Frommer's instead of Saturday on
Sunday because today and complete
honestly I am just staying in doing work
so I'm doing some blog posts I've just
bought at Chanel Christmas blog post
collection blog post and I'm going to do
I want to put them together about my ski
trip and also I've got a new outfit
posts I shot yesterday with Alex I'm
gonna get all that done but - - I
thought that today would be a bit of a
nom de a bit boring for you guys so I
thought I'd roll the two together and
kind of add this on to the very end of
Saturday
that the flat is so tidy it makes me so
happy I'm gonna make myself some gonna
make some crap an avocado on toast kamal
a coming together the lame step 1
toast covered in awesome avocado then we
need some crap so on i'm just gonna put
a little bit of pine nuts on the top as
well for a little bit of crunch and then
finish off with a little bit more lime
lime lime lime lime lemon lemon and
we're done after watch One Tree Hill in
my lovely tidy office I think this may
have been the biggest failure of a
Frommer's day yet this is because we've
just stayed in or I've just stayed in
all day working and doing blog posts so
I guess just look out for the blog posts
on in the throat okay I suppose because
that's what been working on all day yeah
hope you enjoyed Frommer's fro missus
nearly coming to an end

worth of roses so far I'm seeing you
then and love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
