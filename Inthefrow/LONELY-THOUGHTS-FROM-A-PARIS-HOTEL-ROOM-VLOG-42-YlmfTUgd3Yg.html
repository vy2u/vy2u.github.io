restaurant in the Louvre I'm not too
sure which one but all the girls going
into a food cut a delicious meal at cafe
Molly
and look how amazing this view is I am
so tired I had a worse sleep the worse
sleepless night woke up like probably
four times just which they put TMI but
the same pool of sweat to just too hot
not knowing where I was I know there's a
light on over there that I'm like what
is this I've got to turn that off and
then tell me it could fit the turndown
service has closed the curtains so it's
really really dark in here with Yuja I
just like to have blind if I can see a
little bit of light coming up in this
from the street so she just sorted that
out yes it's all my mind just couldn't
settle at all so I kept awake awake not
oh this out and if literally saw cuz
like what is that and inside about it
and locked in some of those little pack
of the vitamin C tablets so you put in
with water so I have one of them at home
I feel a little bit better I'm going to
a little event this morning with resolve
and way which is Jen at Kim's head round
Tunis I haven't used that much way from
anyway products before but I know that
they're like really well loved by a lot
of people I know so for me the nice
event and Patricia's going
we're gonna go along together which
would be nice so I'm super obvious
reasons I just had a big shower to
completely clean myself so I feel a bit
more like fresh but I feel like so I
might just ill nice to mix just like
there I'm really go she says well I
didn't bring in a gym kit so I can't
work out today today is like a day off
for us between our Laurel activities and
that Laurel activities onsen you've got
a good day off today so I'm gonna go to
brunch then I was gonna head along with
the Nicholas Kirkwood presentation and
I've got the day free so I was thinking
of walking around Paris nipping seduced
or no pen maybe imposition else tour a
little peak you know how looking
galleries Lafayette and Sephora I also
wouldn't mind going to the dealer
exhibition yeah so I've got a few things
that potentially want to do today and
I'm seeing L'Oreal ad
like to were having some went to mall
feebler again where I went would deal
last week
it wasn't even last week it was this
week with Monday night
also last night I mean it was really
late my cotton but I saw that Lilly
pebbles how to mentioned the Lady Gaga
documentary on Netflix is a little
interesting put that on him it's like a
tuna bit our documentary to realize
anyway so good soak up watching that's
like an hour a bit yeah you know and a
half a lot so now just pause it so that
I really do you need to go to bed now
because like 2 a.m.
honestly highly recommend it it's been
so beautifully shocked it's really like
I open it to Lady Gaga's life and the
stuff she go through and like she's in
quite a lot in it and she's a very
emotional person in it I didn't really
ever know that side of us is quite quite
eye-opening to walk it after she goes
through and attacked his life she has
and there was one bit that was so
emotional about how she wrote Joanne if
you've heard the album Joanne then
you'll have heard the title track g1
which is my favorite song on the whole
album and it's the most beautiful very
emotional song about and then with her
family that she lost and boy it's just
it's just heartbreaking and she plays
the song I mean it I don't know never
ruin it for you but anyway it's quite
emotional you know having lost a
grandparent recently to it kind of like
but you know kind of hit me in all the
emotions so I was just like a bawling
shallow side so I'm just a bawling mess
in bed last night
yes let's play why didn't sleep as well
sounds like it's big emotional wreck
oh gosh die is so intense that literally
tastes like I've put three Baraka's into
this but sound like oh wow how about in
it right yeah I know stuff oh my god
it's just so intense
that's too much oh I don't like it
anyway so I won't get myself ready I
don't have that much time
I'm gonna get myself ready and see
little bit Oh God I'm just feeling it so
deflated today for absolutely no reason
I think I'm just very very tired after a
long month of fashion with and it's
almost over and I keep thinking to
myself like just give it come on Nathan
you be home
Yohe content now they would have seen a
good good coffee yeah it's you know good
coffee I feel much better
I'm just gonna quickly pack I mean I'm
not leaving for a day or so I'd only
have to do it tonight anyway so plus I'm
thought it would also give me time to
show you what I've been wearing and what
I packed so right first up first barn
undress the plaid tartan mini absolutely
in love with that by the way I will
leave everything link down below in
order I show you it all now whilst I'm
not packing it that's for the Batman
show I watched some our own show and I
wore that with a pair of jean Vito Rossi
boots absolutely adore these boots oh
please don't be too bossy boots now for
a couple of seasons I think they still
sell because they're like the classic
star boot honestly I have just got so
much wear out of them they're a big
investment start off with but they
quality and the whole style of thermos
and it's not really ever gonna go out of
fashion that openiy be it's just amazing
so they are really a great investment
piece then I wore the this incredible
dress to the barn party which I and do
adore it okay so then I wore that with
these boots from my cast today with
you're seeing this already but the ones
with the killer killer heels pretty sure
these are a 120ml heel because they were
absolutely me and well they wouldn't
have done so if I hadn't worn them for
four hours straight I would have been
fine
otherwise as you know me but for hours
and these stood on my concrete outside
at the parties a little much for me I'll
be honest mayor form of my foot today I
just I don't want to have to wear heels
clicks out killer me I have only brought
heels on this trip I've got what six
seven eight pairs of heels
not even one pair of flat shoes story of
my life
then yesterday I don't very can casual
chill outfit this little leather tan
miniskirt which I'm a paired with this
very easy ball man
Jersey sweat super simple and easy to
wear and actually if you really like
Bower man and you don't really wanna
have to spend on the boots or a bag on
one of the dresses or the Blazer which
are all seal for about thousand pound
each this I think is about 250 280 so
it's a bit a little bit little bit more
affordable if you really want to buy
into Bower man but you don't know what
do I rather enjoyed wearing that as well
I did bring this gorgeous dress with me
from the three floor but I haven't had
chance to wear this and I don't think
I'm going to have time now so I'm gonna
pack this away
I wore my Christian Dior bra I'm trying
to get as much where as actually
physically possible out of this bad boy
so well that no warrant as I started
doing recently underneath these kind of
very sheer lace top my favorite the
moment being this one from Reese you're
losing my voice yeah charming young but
you can't see us good I just realized
that's completely right at all I know
gonna wear these I'm nobody cool so I
can make ours just a few more minutes to
pack

keytar I've got my dual slingbacks with
