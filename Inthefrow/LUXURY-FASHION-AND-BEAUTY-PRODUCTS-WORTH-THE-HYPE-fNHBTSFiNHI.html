all doing so well as always this is
gonna be a product set up very much work
high video I don't think I've done one
of these before and I figured I'd also
do beauty and fashion combined not sure
if anyone ever really does that but I
figured I'd go through my kind of little
wardrobe and luxury products and talk
about everything I actually think is
worth the honey let's start off with
what I have right here first thing on
the list okay I know Lisa 2:30 please
don't hate on me they need a wash
I realize Real Techniques brushes just
in general amazing I invested in so many
Real Techniques brushes back when I
first pack blogging and when I first
like get really obsessed with beauty and
now seriously worth the hype that very
affordable brushes they don't shed they
are extremely soft they are wonderful
for blending and you still think you can
go wrong with Real Techniques fake tan
the future Liberata phenomenal 2 to
3-week Tan has been my favorite now for
buying year I do kind of mix up a few
different ones but I find that the Vita
Liberata kind of products are kind of
wrote hype there's a lot of buzz about
them and it's totally justified I
totally draw this term and I wear it I
try and put on a coat with this at least
once a week usually every 5 days or so I
know it says like it lasts two to three
weeks I don't look fine now I mean I
don't moisturize every day who does have
that sort of time I wish I did probably
for that reason it doesn't quite last
two to three weeks on me but it does
give me a really lovely brahms it
doesn't streak if I play it correctly I
know in the past I've had some bad tan
nightmares such a lot of you have
pointed out in videos which fair dues
they were very very bad but if I apply
this properly and make sure I've got
moisturizer off my knuckles and bit of
NARAS my knees and my elbows then I am
good to go with this it's great I
thought another product very much hyped
up our Urban Decay eye shadows like the
naked palettes are the go-to for anyone
that's gonna start out with makeup and
urban decay you cannot go wrong with
naked palettes so I can I wanted to
mention it this at the moment is my fave
it's the Vice limited reloaded xx
unfortunately my mirror is cracked
I'm absolutely gutted but the overall
cause and here are so stunning I use
a lot of the codes more neutral tones
and the champagnes but there was so many
from tax in here to make lots different
I looks so I love it but the
pigmentation throughout all of the Urban
Decay eyeshadow was is fantastic
they are so blendable like soft very
smooth when they're applied and I just
really can't fault them so very much
hyped up very much justify their game
let's just throw in a fashion piece I
didn't want to mention this again
craftsmanship quite a few times but the
gucci dialysis bag has been so hyped
over the past six months
i know pretty much most of my blogger
friends have a dialysis bag in some
shape or form whether it's in the velvet
whether it's in the material or whether
it's in the leather versions mine
offseason the raspberry floral leather
which i'm just still absolutely smitten
and wears i'm pretty sure we can still
buy this for the dialysis shape overall
this whole like huge
lion's head fastening with the metal
work straps is still very much a key
signature piece for gucci still with
season and it was it's very much hyped
but I honestly feel it so justified it's
just such a gorgeous signature bag
everyone I know you have it it's like
their favorite ever bag you know fabrics
you use and the craftsmanship behind the
bags is so luxurious and beautiful and
professional still really think you can
go wrong if you are thinking investing
in a new designer bag and you're
thinking about a few and the Gucci
diocese is on your list and I would
honestly say very much worth the hype it
I totally love mine oh I actually
thought for a second I had this NYX and
we just in case you wanted to brush my
hair but I did bring it for a reason
okay it does have a bit of hair in it
because guess what I use every day but
it's my tangle teezer and I feel it's
one of those products that's been hyped
for years and years of like the
hairbrush and it honestly is just the
best I've not stopped using it I have so
many of these now I can lecture soon a
little bit I think this one in my
handbag but I have one with me at all
times I started using these back when I
started to notice a lot of my hair was
coming out I don't know whether it was
due to bleaching or if it was due to
stress at the time or anything like that
in fact I think it's because I was
growing my hair I'd had my hair and
looking picks he could believe it or not
and I started to grow it it was getting
about here a lot
it was kind of coming out I'm not sure
what was happening anyway I was told to
get Tangle Teezer by a good friend of
mine at the time and she said that she
absolutely loved it so I did convert it
over to a tangle teezer
and never ever look back since I think I
probably probably been using tangle
teezer now for about six years it is
amazing I mentioned this annex actually
Jo Malone candles they're a bit more on
the pricey side I know which is why a
lot of people might be like Joey didn't
suspend that on a candle isn't that good
but honestly I really do love these
candles not only do they look gorgeous I
mean quite often I don't even like to
light them because this looks so pretty
in the jars but they are actually so
beautiful and the fact they have lots of
different a fragrance to choose from
makes them that kind of candle that's
you can perfectly synced it to your
taste
so this one is blackberry and Bay I
haven't even opened this up p-axis still
a brand new one but blackberry and Bay
is one of my favorite scents in this
range like a really deep black race it's
quite fruity but men with a little bit
musky it's so stunning it'll be so
lovely to start burning soon for more
kind of autumnal sense but just how
pretty they are hyped as our candles in
general but these are kind of my faves
another fashion piece you may have seen
this in lots of recent videos actually
about my obsession with stuff portrait
but I feel that self-portrait is kind of
the hyped up brand of the past year
especially when it comes to event
dresses and I honestly feel justifiably
so I have so many of these now I adore
the fit fabrics new of all detailing at
the delicacy of the work that goes into
each of these dresses for the price that
they are they're kind of a mid-range
price so you're talking about 250 pounds
for self portrait dress but see it as a
dress that you will wear you'll have it
for years it's beautifully made it's not
a throwaway item and it's gonna be that
dress that you absolutely love to bits
because you've spent a bit more on it
you invested more in it to buy it
quite possibly you'll buy it for
particular events you'll have some
lovely memories attached to it as well I
just feel at this kind of price is kind
of mid-range price like 200 strange a
pound just makes them so special for so
many people and that's why I just keep
buying them for different events I think
I'm about six dresses now because I go
to so many events they're a perfect
piece and this one especially I wore
this to Casper and Joe's hit the road
premiere felt really pretty in there
absolutely loved wearing it and got so
many compliments I truly adored this
dress but they're also statement they're
recognizable they're a very distinctive
brand and I feel for that they are just
so worth investing in and worth the hype
that comes with them feels very
matter-of-fact today in this video but I
like it
I've just literally what easy so that's
why things a bit of a wash but the
Beautyblender equally I adore the Real
Techniques it's not called the
Beautyblender
it's called some soft sponge miracle
sponge but this is a Beauty Blender I
love both both brands fantastic they're
wonderful for applying makeup I don't do
my makeup now and out sponge I think I
feel completely lost I don't know what I
did before I'm used but this kind of
tool for doing your makeup it's very
much hyped and rightly so it really is
the amount of times I say to my friends
you don't use a Beauty Blender and I
like it don't never thought about buying
one as soon as I put them on to get him
on there totally obsessed it's so good
these sort products at the moment needs
kind of cleansing waters micellar waters
very much hyped in the market and this
is by far so brilliant it sure helped
surprised because a while back I did a
video with Garnier for this product
because I really really believed in this
we did this video and I was really
surprised that quite a few guys in the
comments said that you found it too oily
and that you felt it really kind of
flipped resin to you on the face and I
just haven't found that I don't know if
that's because my skin tone is quite dry
anyway something my skin is just lapping
up and love in the oil I don't know but
I honestly don't get that with this I
have never used such a brilliant
affordable drugstore makeup remover like
this I really haven't
I used to burn Vichy are used to banish
Nell Clarins
Clinique a more waterproof makeup
removers from those kind of brands
because I found it was the only thing
that would get off my water with mascara
wears this if you can usually get it
enough of about 350 in Boots or super
job or anywhere and it's honestly so
brilliant it just wipes away and breaks
down on a waterproof mascara are more
much stronger mascaras so easily it gets
rid of everything
face my face doesn't feel dry afterwards
it doesn't feel tight I honestly
couldn't recommend this more so I was
quite surprised people thought that so I
guess if you are looking or oily maybe
err on the side of course should it
doesn't take time it's a thing that it
may be a little bit oily but if you have
sort of dry to normal skin I honestly
think that you probably love this and
it's worth trying for 350 going back to
fashion again I mentioned these more
times and I have showers I think but
these yummy to Calabria courts they're
quite hype shoe I see so many people
wearing them and I know that I
definitely hike them up some I will stop
at my own hype here but they're honest
is so worth it they're comfortable they
are sophisticated they're classic
they're classy the stylish they go with
everything especially if you buy the
right colors if you buy the black
version and all black will go with
everything these ones in nude and white
again go with everything but I own
literature every single color I can't
recommend this pair of shoes anymore and
seeing I'm talking about them I'll
mention these again and I almost hate
myself for putting these in there cuz
I'll mention them again but very quickly
the Valentino boxes are amazing very
hyped very much loved that everywhere
every time we're going to Selfridges
people are trying on pairs and pairs of
these because so many people want to own
a pair honestly rightly so they're
comfortable they're gorgeous again in
this color specialist is a powder they
go with everything I own literally any
color and I could not recommend them
more that's stunning okay I got my over
with I feel better now I just have to
mention them like I feel bad mention
them again but yeah I had a handful of
them this bronzer has been hiked ever
since I started to shoot at blogging so
for years and I felt an estimation
because rightly so it's a NASA community
this is a huge version in this gorgeous
packaging which I'm a little bit in love
with I'll be honest huge mirror comes
with a little brush as well but
generally just the product itself is a
stunning bronzer I use it pretty much
every single day it is a spectrum of
orange tone to stone it's very much in
the middle so you don't get either you
don't get too cool tone ah to water and
it's come up perfect in between and it's
it really is worth behind I've heard a
lot of people recently talking about how
much they adore L'Oreal lipsticks so I
kind of feel it's just me that hears
this Hank but it's definitely out there
L'Oreal lipsticks are very much hype too
that kind of drugstore lipstick so yeah
I guess I - - I see L'Oreal is that very
hybrid between drugstore and luxury
because I find their products so
fantastic they're just a little bit more
affordable but these are the brand new
girl obsession ones actually so here we
have pink gold and we have beige gold
which are my two phases also news gold
as well which is lovely these are my two
favorites but generally just talking
about Lauri lipsticks in general
pigmentation is always fantastic they
are not too drying they have a lovely
consistency a little texture
pigmentation is always great have I
already said that I don't know yeah I
honestly feel these are some of the best
drugstore kind of mid-market
lipsticks that you can pick up with the
height hundred percent eyebrow product
worth the hype you might notice that my
eyebrows as soon we start getting a
little bit darker recently I love it it
might not be 24th taste this whole right
white blonde with dark brows but I just
really like it a little bit you know a
bit more alternative that way I guess
but the ice age of Beverly Hills in
chocolate the dip brow pomade command /
made in chocolate
I knew this four years ago it dried up
so start to do something else didn't
think about it again when Sephora picked
up another film of it again and I'm
totally back of the hype totally back of
the hype it's so brilliant it's just
that very waxy pigmented formula that
just makes your brows look perfect if
you use the right brush you're going to
use the right brush but if you do use
your own brush that you're onto an
absolute winner
along the same lines the Anastasia
liquid lipsticks people might disagree
with me on this
I've had a few mentions recently about
different liquid lipstick some people
find these a little bit dry and I'd
really love them I really really do I
think the color choice is gorgeous I
mean I have a very every shade of
they're more nude range yeah
her she's my favorite as you probably
know but I honestly find the texture and
consistency of these fine
I would recommend putting on a bit of a
lip balm beneath them and throughout the
day to talk a little bit more lip balm
but generally the core will stay your
lips will look really perfected I love
the kind of matte finish especially when
it's just done they really make my lips
look really pouty so I honestly do think
they aren't worth the hype I really love
them and she likes things our dimension
our concealers we've got the Mac prep
and prime in light boost I also have
medium here but generally this range
light gruesome medium if you're looking
for something quite right nning
illuminating but also covering well a
little bit covering then the macro from
prime is really really brilliant product
actually I think a lot of people use
these I mean I don't see how as many
people use news nowadays as I used to on
YouTube but I still think the hype is
there and I love it but also the Bobby
Brown corrector I remember the
hypotenuse four years ago was huge I
remember watching Tanja apply this like
constantly and I was like I need to sort
out and got it so I've got Bobby Brown
here in light peach corrector but I mean
I'm hit hit panelist now it's so
brilliant I often use this rather than
underneath my can see like most people
do I have to put this over the top but I
find it warms up and you can see that
I've got I'm just asked that finishing
touch that just manages to kind of blend
my concealer into my foundation better
and just warm up my under eyes into that
kind of perfect shade for me so it's a
really brilliant product still hyped and
definitely worth it I think that's it
actually that was more than a probably
should have done but I wanted to show
you everything that I did actually think
was really worth the hype in more luxury
beauty and fashion segments so let me
know what you think if you liked the
video please give it a like cuz that
would really help me out and if you're
brand new here I'd love it if you
