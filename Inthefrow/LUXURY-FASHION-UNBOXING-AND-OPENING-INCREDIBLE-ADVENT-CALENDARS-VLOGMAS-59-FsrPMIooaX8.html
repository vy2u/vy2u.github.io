went for my over knee to it Wiseman's as
well look cute little dress I like this

reason to wear favorite show Malone

overall look it's a perfect New Year's
Eve party look highlight the eye shadow
and the lipstick totally obsessed right
so I guess order of the days I just need
to head home do some work and then we
might suggest a date night made it home
from my filming and I did want to do
date night but I think Alex wants to
just do like Whole Foods and get food
don't you I just don't want to read any
more about food really we've just done a
month of just eating trash so I'd rather
just make a big healthy salad they kept
the salad so we're gonna go tell food
we're gonna come back
but really gonna come back with loads of
snack yeah I've done it to hell food how
cute is this hat I match the not sure
where it's from but I'll leave it like
down below even adorable faux fur by the
way isn't it cute a little too around
helping keep seeing Naomi's face
everywhere here she must be so cool
having a booking like one of your
favorite stores alex is perusing the
carpet decisions decisions
mm-hmm see what that's not it should I
wear hat every day gets a bit itchy
itchy and scratchy this is the part
where we spend 10 minutes choosing
Alex's beers because he can never decide
so I like to choose the ones that have
pretty pictures on them this one's
called yellow snow
don't like that one I like the colors in
the hunt for the session IPA is normally
a bit lower so you want to go for the
ones that like nine or ten percent no
you don't be serious okay so I was
making the pasture for us which is very
very nice with it I just thought I'd
quickly show you a few things and open
my advent calendars with you guys so
last night we all came home with a
little goodie bag on inside there we
would treat to the j'adore law essence
to pot farm so this will be the oil
version of shadowlaw very very lovely as
they call it a gift and we were also
sent home live the Dior advent calendar
I don't even think you can buy this it's
like Super Smash so let's open this
together shall we
isn't Bo oh my god it actually has
proper lately this is adorable thing
I've ever seen
got a little mister your Eau de Parfum a
little time you on this is that so you
do horrible Oh
winner winner nice gorgeous over there
TV I've got a couple of other ones as
well
LMS because I'm a huge LMS fan so let's
see number one is oh nice I can't even
tell you how many of these actually have
because I stock up on the hydrogel eye
masks these alleged like travel saviors
trust me they're incredible so the one
I'm gonna keep these in here to keep the
shape of everything how nice and I'm
guessing that's we're gonna be like a
pro college of marine cream or something
insane and then the other one I have is
deathly on one we've got an aroma
cleanse 3:1 hydration smoothing and
cleansing mousse
oh these are so good from the plane if
I'm everyone like if I'm over on the
plane and just need to kind of take off
makeup quickly these are like saviors
they're so good
okay so three incredibly miniatures now
there's another one there is another one
this was a major treat from German
and everyone that went to the breakfast
earlier got to take away one of the
German other clubs I think these are one
of the most like coveted I'll add
vikander to the whole II owe you for
December no self there's so many of you
haven't kind I think this is like the
one that beats them all I'll so of hurt
I'm not sure I had one of these last
year anyway it's a beautiful look at
that I kind of don't want to do the
ribbon oh no we have to to enter it da
okay is really exciting these two little
doors to the townhouse oh my gosh this
is kind of thing as well but you can
keep like I can keep this and then next
year I'd fill it with like little treats
for Alex maybe okay
so amazing
Wow how insane number one has a little
mini almond sweet almond macaroon candle
and oh my goodness I've never seen Jo
Malone candle this tiny oh this is the
most cute thing we showed sorry guys
now I'm totally sold out but just kind
of keep it in mind for next year to get
the Jill Malone advent calendar soon as
it's released because we're friendly I
think this is going to be amazing so
night now the other thing which is super
exciting is that in the day when I went
into Dolce &amp;amp; Gabana they very kindly
offered me an outfit which is incredible
I like being transparent with you guys
about where things coming from and all
that kinda thing and yeah they offered
to dress me and said I could keep an
outfit which is phenomenal so I went to
the store and looked around I spent a
couple of hours there and found some
beautiful things so I'm gonna show you
know one car don't fist up how cute with
the little dust bag and leave a link to
these by the way down below but I know
someone itself is online
these are so cool so cool just with like
an ordinary pair jeans an ordinary
jacket and knit it would just be like
the statement boom and ready so in right
now and it's just got this very cool
graffiti all over the boots and the
Coulee oh the gin thank you babe good
yeah so these boots awesome such a cool
statement piece
so dolce gabbana a lot of fun really
first stop I picked up this pair of
jeans which if you saw my doctor in
Japan a video from the day I wore these
to the show and I couldn't get my mind
off them because they've left me those I
couldn't get a line off them and I
thought actually these are so cool so
different to anything else I own I don't
know how much I'd want to wear them with
the boots with the all the graffiti but
these are the cool pair of black boots
would look pretty awesome so I got the
use and a gallery list down below I know
we can get those from well I'm only
saying it because we're in Cabana I've
noticed that a lot of different stores
online have different stock so trying to
find one piece can be a little tricky
sometimes I have found that so Oh
the next piece which I think you've kind
of filled out everywhere but you can't
get in all the colors gosh this is so
cool it's most gorgeous fabric I think
it's a cashmere knit and I'm pretty sure
that this is dominique oh DOJ's cat with
a crown on I actually got this in a size
44 I think it's meant to be quite a
fitted cropped jumper and it literally
had this one left in the UK and as I
look let me try and it looks like it's
not fair and it's perfect it just look
fits like a nice oversized jumper what
isn't it cute and the very last piece is
absolutely incredible cute was probably
for the rest of my entire life this
leather jacket it's got a lot of funds
going on it's got a lot of gold works oh
when you wear it open like this you see
all these buttons and things it just
looks so cool thrown on color parked
over near over sort easy black skinny
jeans
it's very bike and very rockin all and
it's stunning absolutely stunning
beautiful weather so yeah absolutely I'm
just absolutely older than me
with these I'm just absolutely learning
I feel like the luckiest girl in the
world
honestly I can't actually believe that I
own these beautiful things like
extremely lucky so you're gonna be
seeing a lot more of those over the next
few months and into the future I'm sure
so that was a lung of long talk but that
I think is kind of everything happened
today was a pretty awesome day really
art from day I let my filming went so
well breakfast this morning these
beautiful things have arrived I was feel
extremely lucky anyway I'm gonna leave
you for now I'm gonna dis enjoy us
