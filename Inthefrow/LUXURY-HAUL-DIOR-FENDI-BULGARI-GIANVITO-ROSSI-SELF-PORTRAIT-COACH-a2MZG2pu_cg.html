winners still one winner to go for the
very last giveaway which I'm obviously
draw at the very very end of the video
stick around for that and by the way
there will be one video going up on
Christmas Day it's just a bit of a kind
of Christmasy festive video just to sort
of say Merry Christmas so yeah so make
sure you are subscribed and stick around
for that on Sunday but this video is
actually more about luxury products as a
lot of us seem to love I know that I do
and I've got a few new things recently
that I haven't really shown you leave
either be on the blogs a bit on
Instagram and I started to have ever
roundup of everything that's kind of new
for the past few months that have not
really shown you just in case you get a
bit of money over Christmas or you want
to treat yourself to something before
Christmas or maybe some things will go
into boxing day sale so you never know
so I hope those would be that are
helpful and when I get through them
quick because I've been chatting too
much I'm gonna kick this off actually
with sunglasses first pair how amazing
are these I think these are the Fendi in
Rydia sunglasses and I always wanted
this pair and I saw them everywhere on
loads of Instagram people and slugged
them and just totally fell off me how
cool is this shape and the really cat
eye vet needs it blue and tortoise and
awesome they're so so great I'll leave a
link down below exactly where I got
these because they can be a bit rare on
a few different websites it took me a
while to find a website that did them so
I'll leave them link down below know the
pair of sunnies as well these are from
sunglasses shop and they're another pair
of do your apprecia these are the
surreal
a little bit different as you have this
banding across here this can like copper
band and then this is unlike a mat have
found a tortoiseshell nothing I saw
these if you saw my come shopping with
me you'll see me wearing a pair of these
in the Dior boutique and I fell in love
with them and these were come the
closest I could find online and just
fell in love pretty much so yeah they've
been all over the blog recently I'm in
love with them let's move in - I kind of
want to keep back to the end I'll test
the packs in the moment I'm going to
show you this dress if you haven't seen
this already literally I feel like this
is the only dress I have worn for the
past few weeks and it's this little
self-portrait number have I shown you
this yet I don't think I have it kind of
run run new season self-portrait I got
this from Louis V Roemer and it's so
gorgeous it's just a navy blue with
black lace detailing the laces time on
the majority of the body is in a navy
blue star print so they kind of mix up
the very floral lace into this more star
print and it's so beautiful
you've got a zipper out of the back to
get you in and some black place kind of
cutouts around the midriff but don't
show off too much and then this lace
ruffling that's tiered all the way down
into the skirt now I'll be honest with
you this is somewhat short I'm 5 foot 7
I always wear this with heels and it is
kind of short I mean walking around
perfect if I'm sitting down you're
really gonna kind of pull this over you
bomb to make sure that you're not just
sucked on your bare skin I'll be honest
but it doesn't bother me too much as
long just pull it down cross my legs in
elite like fashion from all good and
demands a little bit so much that I
don't care that much so that's what I've
been living in apparel in fact this a
few more now I'm not usually sweater
kind of gal I mean jumpers like this
maybe but not so much sweaters but I got
this one from Coach and it's so cute I
mean totally like I don't think you'd
have a pick us out for me because I
don't think I would ever use a bit south
I saw it and loved it it's nice satin
silky banding around both of the arms
and this really suit like raccoon and
then this embellished sequin and pearl
effect is so cute
it's all those really easy sweaters to
throw on where you want the kind of
off-duty casual model look that I always
try and go for and don't quite chief but
you know one day hopefully achieve that
look with this jump oh my gosh I'm so in
love with these I'm so in love with
these in fact a blog post has just gone
live today an hour ago in fact now we go
on in the Frodo comp and it includes the
shoot so if you want to see more
pictures you're wearing it she's oh and
the dress and the dress of the dress
with the shoes then you can see some
more pictures but these are the John
Peter rustic Calabria courts in the new
blush pink sleeves like the brand new
season chubby to a rusty color honestly
I mean you guys probably know if unless
you're new here in which case you'll
soon find out but I'm a bit of a jumpy
Taurasi collector
I love Shafi terrassa display at my 8th
pair they are just the most comfortable
heels they go with so much especially
when you kind of get the calabria
because we've got plastic size to them
that everyone some ones are they
comfortable and they really are
comfortable I don't see why this
wouldn't be comfortable it just sits
around the Savi feet it doesn't dig in
it just yeah this is so great and in
this color they're really pretty
they're very neutral but not too bright
Pink's you can wear them with everything
pretty much big big fan love these a lot
another pair of boots again I'm kind of
going for the alternative hit bot would
you pick these out for me
probably not but I'm gonna wear these
home tomorrow back to Wigan and seeing
us in half is so much cooler than the
South I don't care what anyone says it's
honestly like a few degrees colder up
north every time I go back from London
to Wigan I'm like what does happen to
the weather I mean obviously it's a long
way away but still so I'm gonna take
these just in case it gets super cold
these are so comfortable these are a
pair of Sorel boots I had a pair last
year after that trip to Iceland
really thick really wintery and they
were perfect for Iceland but these a
little bit thinner which is good for
kind of UK weather but they're just
really cool and it's where the pair of
jeans tucked in again it's just a nice
easy boot and I put this on Instagram a
lot if you ask me where I got them from
so I figured I'd mention them because
they're pretty cool actually and I'm
gonna get a lot wear out of these I
think okay and finally let's talk
through some new bags first up how
adorable is this Coach bag so this is
from coach again it's kind of like new
season it's part the 1941 collection
which is come out they're super
luxurious designer collection and this
is just adorable it's super kind of
vintage old-school styling it's got the
rivets all over it so it's got a very
westernized feel that Coach is sort of
gone for this season anyway it's just
very sweet I think it should my Nana
this should be like
so cute I used to wear stuff like that
when I was younger but it's got this
really modernized twist which coach
often goes for they kind of take these
very vintagey nineteen fifties sixties
bags and turn them to something super
modern amazing and this are absolutely
love me it's a beautiful cream shade you
could just sort of wear it like this
whole like that or you know Karen unless
you want you can carry however you like
but it's so cute I love it it's also so
affordable it's about 495 pound I say
fall because office it's not in a
thousand pound rages it's a little bit a
little bit less a little bit more for
when it comes to luxury back another
absolute cutie pie I don't think I've
shown you this yet guys well how cute is
this little Fendi bag it has eyelashes
have actual eyelashes how cute is this
can you see stick out and it's got this
very kind of like I always think it
looks a bit like a little owl but the
other face is and also comes with a long
silver chain so this is one of those
perfect kind of wallet on chain sides
Malick's is similar size to my Chanel
wallet on shame but it's gorgeous
really bright silver chain and it's just
stunning because one of those really
cute little pieces you can wear every
single day just for more statement back
another tiny little bag this is a new
Bulgari bag you may know I have the
gorgeous sapphire metallic this one is
the silver well it's called it's like a
quilted silver leather it's just
stunning I mean the bull bear bags I've
always said this but they're almost like
an extension of your jewelry it's not
like you're carrying an accessory it's
like you're carrying a jewelry piece
that's how I always feel with this
because it's just absolutely exquisite
detailing I always feel so lovely
wearing these and they're just
absolutely gorgeous
so I have this one to add to my
collection and I'm just feel very lucky
I love it and that's it guys so many
gorgeous new pieces
I'm just lip obsessed with these shoes
and cannot wait to wear this fab for
Christmas so I just love absolutely
everything at the moment I just wanted
to show you guys like I said just in
case you have a little bit extra
spending money from Christmas and maybe
I ought to treat yourself and you never
know some of these things may be in sale

just in case and in case you liked
anything plus I really wanted to talk
about some luxury products again because
