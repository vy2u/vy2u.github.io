really excited about filming this video
I feel like I've not done I kind of sit
down with you and talk about products
and fashion in a while so we're looking
for six I've kind of gone if we're
finding my products for this video and
I'm like yeah I'm really really excited
about filming today so let's just kind
of get into it it's been a while since I
filmed anything very fashion luxury
related so there's going to be quite a
lot of new products in this video that
you won't seen before but rest assured
these were not bought at the same time
in the same month or anything like that
they've been bought over the last six
months or so very much spread out some
of them were bought with vouchers some
one were bought with my own money
somewhere bought with discount codes but
I wanted to show you everything in case
you had your eye on anything and just to
generally talk about how much we love
luxury fashion pretty much I'm just
going to kick this off with the bag that
I probably bought the longest time ago
and it is this bag I think I may have
shown this in a favorites video but I've
not really talked through the actual bag
itself that lot you don't think but just
in case I have I'm gonna kind of speed
through out don't I kind of bore anyone
with this this is the Gucci dionysus bag
I think it's kind of like a raspberry
floral I'm not too sure what the actual
color is but of course I'll leave it
linked down below it has a really cool
snake with the little lion head on it so
it's really cool features very chunky
strap in fact I've got the other part
strap inside please protect it it's got
this double strap or you can wear it as
a single strap if you prefer like this
but I just completely fell in love this
bag when I saw it and I've used it so
much since it's such a good size suicide
it has like three pockets one two three
so you can actually fit quite a lot in
here so I can fit my camera in my phone
quite a lot of makeup keys etc and I
love the fact this mechanism is so like
such a fine to click sort of clicks in
perfect lessly not kind of worrying as
everything's going to fall out it's a
very secure back and it's just it's
really love this bag I'm so glad I got
it I'm like so happy
that I took the slogan bought their
speaking let me sit for you if you can
see this is what it looks like yeah it's
a total total beauty and yeah so going
to pick this up I'm just going to mix
this up between clothes accessories and
shoes the next thing I'll show you was
actually a wonderful gift from Avenue 32
and it is this beautiful Peter pilato
Bardot top in this wonderful chambray
kind of material elasticated around the
bossing get a really good kind of fit
around your arms it billows out into
these wide or short sleeves kind of like
mini sleeves again it's quite a line in
its shape and it's sort of almost flows
out a bit parachute style but it's
extremely flattering it's got a
beautiful floral lace detail across the
boss so it's just so pretty
every time I wear this everyone's always
complimenting me on it everyone's
society where is that from still
beautiful and I remember seeing this
when I went to watch the Peter pilato
show like last year and thinking how
much I loved it so as soon as it came
out to stores totally totally smitten at
Hamilton Avenue 32 and I work with them
quite often and they were very very kind
to send it me as a gift if you know me
well you will know that I you should
always have typic sit cases I don't know
what it is about them that is very very
sturdy it had the four wheels on the
bottom which I kinda like rose gold so
super cute they're the perfect size like
this one fits inside the cabin so it's
great for carry-on luggage and then I
always used to have the matching middle
suitcase and also the largest suitcase
because you guys know I travel so much
and I always need very very good
suitcases and I have used my pink lawn
to the depths of despair it is now
rugged it just doesn't look quite as
pretty as it used to so I needed some
new ones look and these are those really
gorgeous these are called the platinum
range the floral on it is a little bit
more subtle than last season and I like
the fact it's quite silvery and there's
something a little bit more kind of
masculine and cool about the use rather
they're very kind of bright girly pretty
yeah great
next up is another Gucci bag so I saw
this on Kendall Jenner's Instagram
actually she has this one in red and
black totally fell in love with it I
love the way that the straps are made of
this metal rather than just a usual
leather straps which is quite a
different feature for a backpack brush
at the moment I just wanted something a
little bit more unique and the fact this
was all black meant that I knew if I
took it to festivals or if I took it on
holiday it won't get damaged quite as
easily as I think was maybe a tan or a
different colour and again they've got
fits quite a lot in for me actually it's
got quite a large space got some bits in
here from her last trip this would be
like the perfect festival backpack size
you can fit pretty much everything in
here looks like a big bottle of water
etc plus it's got the front pocket as
well so yeah I thought this was adorable
and I actually bought this in duty-free
at the airport where it had a 200 pound
off it and because I've had my eye in it
thought I'll treat myself to that I've
got it as like a pre-holiday
pre-birthday big treat next up is a bag
that I got from vest ear collective if
you've never had a vest yet it's a
website where you can sell your
secondhand or used clothing shoes
accessories all of that it's kind of
like a very very high-class eBay style
and they wanted to work with me and we
worked on a project together and in
return they gifted me this incredible
bag this is the Luther Tom Capucine BB
bag in the grey and the town I'm not too
sure I gotta leave a link down below but
I was totally smitten with it and I
absolutely love this whole Capucines
range so when I saw their selves like
this is that perfect bag for me so it
comes in a tan leather strap tan
fastenings with fastening goes into a
little fastening here that clips
together wasn't really clip together
just kind of pushes together like this
it's also got the LZ on the front and
this is a fabric it's white and black
thread woven fabric so of course you're
going to be a bit more careful with this
you can't be kind of putting it in the
dirt of soil but I really love it and so
far so good I haven't ruined this yet
it's still looking like as good as new
and literally this was kind of this is
secondhand it looks absolute perfection
so if you're looking for any kind of
second-hand bags our bags for a bit of a
cheaper price and have a look on there
absolutely boiling it is so hot in the
UK right now it's getting hotter and
hotter next up is this stunning cream
lace blouse from temple II I love the
Templar brand I think she makes some
absolutely incredible dresses and a lot
of things are very kind of lacy and very
romantic and I saw this and immediately
fell in love it's like a white cream
crochet lace very very delicate and of
course it's somewhat see-through but I
just always wear like a white bra with
this like even wear a very kind of
pretty lacy white brown underneath if
you like to it doesn't really bother me
because it is still so much going on the
front that I kind of feel like I saw not
to look at my bra then that's kind of up
to them otherwise everything else is
kind of so beautiful up here
it's just a beautiful beautiful top
crochet effect around the neckline it's
just absolutely stunning
so I thought you might like to see this
next we have a pair of shoes from Malone
so yeah I'm pretty sure that's how you
say it
Malone severe and I had my eye on these
for so long they're a little bit
different familiar things this is so
bright and you should go for kind of
like red black or cream I think in a lot
of shoes aqua yeah red black or cream
and these being so kind of multicolored
and rainbow effect I don't know but it's
really really stood out to me and
they're all so massively on sale which
makes a huge difference like 70% off now
so I'll leave the link down below for
those so you can wrap them and lace them
up around your leg which is a style I am
adoring right now together to have so
many things that you can kind of strap
up your leg but it is very very pretty
and again I get so many compliments on
these because it is so dramatic and
different and very very unique really
should have prepared these before I
started talking but yeah Alex much
better yeah whether such love a shoe
very statement kind of thinking where I
would like black jeans and a black top
or well you could even wear like a red
dress with these it could wear green
dress I'd say anything that can falls
into these categories on Navy like Navy
jeans or light blue jeans skirts Navy
shorts denim shorts they're very very
cool and yeah there's at least of its a
new pair of sunnies these are pair from
Victoria Beckham's
and then I click this it's really quite
dirty now much on the lenses but these
are huge aviator style very very
marriage you can probably see yourself
right now but these are so cool I mean I
love the aviator style anyway I'm a big
fan of Victoria Beckham I'm just a big
big fan of huge sunglasses so these
completely screamed out to me at the
time the facts like this purple purple
pearlescent finish on the lenses
I just like oh I knew these in my life
so I wore these last week when I to
Vegas and when I was in LA and it's a
very kind of big statements and what's
yeah so those are Phoebe another thing I
thought I would show you that I'm just
so totally in love with and my brand new
Chevy took russy's so these are another
pair of Calabria court shoes with the
kind of plexi fit plastic here I already
have one pair in white cream which I've
worn to death in fact I'm thinking of
repurchasing those shoes because I wear
them so often my kind of money per wear
is so minuscule I love them to bits it
was so comfortable and these were in
sale they were like 40 50 percent off I
think and I absolutely adored the kind
of Aztec style print in the Gulf threads
and the cream backing I mean these are
kind of wearing now because I've loved
them quite a bit already and also when I
was away I was like grass for these and
they got grass stains all the way up and
on the toes and I was like oh my god
this is ridiculous and somehow I wanted
to scrub it off like lightly but that
comes like come off but I thought that
you should be such fragile shoes and in
fact they're clean so perfectly so yeah
absolutely stab it I was gonna go Shelby
to Rossi aside my bang so when I saw
these on sale so yes they have to be my
collection so that is everything for the
moment I really really hope you enjoyed

of a look into my luxury wardrobe at the
