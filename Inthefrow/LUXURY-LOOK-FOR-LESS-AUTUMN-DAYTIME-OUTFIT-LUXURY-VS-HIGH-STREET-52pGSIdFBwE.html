film this a second of my luxury look for
less videos you're getting to really
really enjoy first one so if you've not
seen this before I'll leave a link down
below to the very first one I did but
pretty much the whole premise is just
that I find a luxury outfit everything
that's kind of like up a high street
designer to really luxury fashion outfit
and I'll find you the exact same or I
think quite similar pieces in a very
high street or more affordable outfit at
least I really enjoyed put the skin left
I'm I'm really excited to do this this
time I must admit though it takes a lot
of work to put these videos together
like I think it took me about five hours
to find equivalent outfit this time so
really you really do hope that you like
it I think you've done a pretty good job
can't wait to see what you think
so let's get into this okay for the
first piece in a luxury item I kind of
built everything around this piece I
think it's perfect for winter and I
think so many of you are going to want
buy one so the camel coat this one is
from Marsh
I still haven't worn this yet I'm about
to wear it tomorrow for a bliss Fashion
Week so this is five hundred and twenty
nine pounds but it's an incredible
incredible calico in fact probably my
favorite camel coat I've ever had it's
double-breasted it's really sick woolen
material so this is like one of those
super warm winter coats you can wear it
like a beautiful in fact I'm a little
wear it like a burberry scarf tucked
into this and kind of like knee over
knee boots jeans big chunky knits and
love it to bits
well yeah it's absolutely beautiful so I
kind of built everything around this so
I tried to find an equivalent as well as
I was saying about the coat and the
whole like knitwear thing I thought and
then go for like a cream knit so I found
this really gorgeous watch lifting
people tree at a sauce this is a hundred
and eighty-five pounds this is one like
pricier style jumper but it's an
incredible cable net it's so thick
dick I won't be surprising this like
mohair I think that this looks it's got
that very natural wool feel to it and I
thought this for winter will be so cozy
and cute yeah it is a little bit more on
the pricey side so but I did find a
really good one for high street cat
would show you the next piece was a pair
of I wanted the jeans to be a little bit
different so I went for kind of coated
jeans anything that looked more coated a
little bit more leather esque style but
just cooked jeans pretty much these are
from diesel just very standard leg
skinny style pockets to the bum I mean
we feel really amazing quality Ashley
it's also got the diesel logo to the
back as well believe with 210 pounds if
you're into designer jeans I mean I do
love my designer jeans but I mean it's
kind of standard price I find this saw
Jean oh yeah
210 okay for shoes I've gone for a pair
of shopping Taurasi these were already
in my collection and these are 450
pounds as you may know I'm a huge every
to Rossi fan so I'm happy to soar
splurge on Sharpie to a rusty every now
and again but I know they're obviously
very very similar shootie so just kind
of plain suede black stiletto shoe but
the quantities is fab I love them I come
off so long in these I thought I'd
include these bad boys as well and the
final piece is the bag I got this from
whistles I've had my eye on this for so
long and it's just so super cute I
really like the whole shape of it how it
kind of fastened in a way it folds over
the front and then fastens it's magnet
and you can open it up it's actually
really really gorgeous backpack I didn't
really let that whole magnet fastening
on the front and this is actually a
little bit smaller than I thought it
would be than what I've seen it online
but I think it is actually mega cute is
that so I thought I might be able to
find something quite soon like this this
is 190 pounds so yeah I can't show you I
thought was quite similar right so let's
see that whole look all together
right so let's see the alternative
started off with the jacket I think that
it pretty good here this is one from
Topshop that I just found and again kind
of a camel style woolen feel fabric it's
not a thick and the fabric doesn't feel
as amazing but the overall style is
pretty awesome and it's still a camel
coat double-breasted pretty much the
exact same length as the other one so
very very very similar and this is only
59 pounds I say only because in
comparison to 560 friends yes a 59 pound
it's not too bad there I thought that
was really beautiful so this is the
original and this is the jig next for
the net I actually really really love
this alternative this is another premium
cable net with a bit of a kind of
turtleneck like a short turtleneck to
this one this one's slightly short as
another squad and it's not quite as sort
of hairy it doesn't feel quite as
natural in terms of the fabrics but
don't think you'll find it actually
since I don't need to find it molting
quite as much but potentially a little
bit but I thought this was so lovely I
actually really want to keep this and
get more in more colors it's really nice
isn't it
and in comparison to this one which was
a 185-pound
this jumper is 35 pounds I mean this is
a little bit more cream tone yellow
toned this is more white term cream but
I think really similar okay so the
alternative to the diesel Khoa jeans I
found this pair from a sauce you got 38
pounds they're a little bit shinier I
guess in the diesel ones but they're
still just like coated style black jeans
wake up sunshine
camera can't see it yeah so these are
diesel ones and these SS on in fact
they're so similar in style like so
similar these are going to have pockets
to the bomb kind of high waisted cells
give you leg to get 38 these are to 10
for the job Yuto Rossi Jeep
I found this pair these were 25 pound so
450 and then 25 they are pretty sound
similar
I mean I'll sell of my champey to
rustics but these are really similar
black suede very similar kind of
straight heel pointed toe he's actually
really really good shoe - yes mix I try
this on and I think this might have been
the hardest thing actually to find a bag
that kind of matched Anika fan Cal a
dupe for so this was the original 194
the whistles bag
I found something kind of similar this
is 55 pounds so it's not like mega cheap
and it's still about there the price of
the whistles back but it's quite similar
in the way that I mean it kind of opens
up here you know very similar style of
opening this is also bigger it feels
like twice sighs maybe other whistles
one but the overall kind of animal print
into the embossing is big but we can see
that is very kind of similar to the
whole animal print feel of this one
again it's got the little handle and it
obviously has straps backpack straps as
well so I feel that they have a lot of
very similar qualities very a slightly
different obviously in their sizing and
then also doesn't say whistles on it the
whole like reptile print feel to it a
lot of with details on each bag a very
similar this is it so that was my luxury
