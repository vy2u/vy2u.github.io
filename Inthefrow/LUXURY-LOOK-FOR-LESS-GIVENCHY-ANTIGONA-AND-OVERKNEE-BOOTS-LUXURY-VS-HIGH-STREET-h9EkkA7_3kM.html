new luxury look for less I really love
filming these you guys can't really like
them so I've tried to get a new one out
I only film one a couple of weeks ago so
if you haven't seen that make sure you
head over there and have a look at my
last one but I want to just kind of give
you one more wintery outfit kind of
before the end of the year in multiple
luxury vs. high street format if you've
ever been here before for luxury look
for less pretty much I find one look
street outfit and try and find one
comparable hang Street outfit so we can
kind of compare prices and see which we
like the best but before we get into
this make sure to stick around to the
very end of the video for another of my
seven days of Christmas giveaways
giveaways it's a very last of my seven
giveaway so make sure you have a look
and make sure you enter okay so this
outfit I kind of wanted to create
something around what I'm kind of
obsessed with right now which is super
over knee boots and also long of knit
dresses so I found this one that I
thought was absolutely beautiful the
knit on this is stunning it's really
chunky very soft bullying quite
luxurious it isn't like a really perfect
material and on the model it looked like
it would be just sort of skimming just
above the knees potentially so that's
what I thought
but before I did this I tried everything
on decide be able to kind of talk you
through what I thought about first and I
absolutely love this it's just too long
you told her oh it's an outfit being
longer and you could wear it with so
many other types of outfits at shoes and
what not for me I was actually looking
for more office sure to dress links yes
so bear that in mind when you're having
to look at this in the cutaways I get
just kind of tucking it under doesn't
kind of see what it'd be like in the
short length thing would be so perfect
some of it got it but as a general sort
of oversized larger knitted dress it's
absolute beautiful this is 150 pounds so
it's a little bit more than your normal
kind of cable net but honestly the
quality of this is absolutely beautiful
it's it's really stunning over the top
of that of course I paired it with my
Rhys shilling AVX jacket I can't get
enough this jacket right now it just
comes with everything it's just such an
easy jacket it's really well for the
winter and I just think
so much use outfit so I kind of wanted
to build an outfit that would work this
in so I could find something that kind
of compared to it that was much much
cheaper
this is 895 pound because it's off its
shilling it's really beautiful luxurious
materials it's super warm it just it
feels like sure it's wonderful I'll
probably wear this now for so many years
to come so it'll definitely understand
it at some time yeah it's more
investment piece for the booties
I wore my pride and Joy's which you've
seen already mine's on Vito Rossi boots
these just see over new boots in the
black suede with the gorgeous to let her
heal and I absolutely adore these that's
why I'm obsessed with banks white
dresses because I'm looking for more
things to wear these with and I really
adore that whole trend first dresses
with over new boots so that's what I
kind of wanted to go for here these are
1395 pounds probably because number one
they're Jean Peter Asik number two
they're incredible suede material
no three are beautifully made yes so
they're quite pricey and the final piece
to the outfit is the piece that I found
a really really good comparison for
tough crowd pleaser this one but this is
absolutely beautiful
it's you've actually Antigona in the
nude
I think I'll see links will be down
below to everything this is a small
version in the nude and yeah it's
gorgeous
don't worry I will be sending this back
I literally got this for the sake of
this video so I could show you a real
comparison so don't worry I haven't just
bought a brand new want to go and effort
you still have my blue one but it look
how pretty is I'm a bit tempted it's so
beautiful and very wearable yeah so it
just all went together as the first
outfit so let's take a look at that
luxury outfit altogether
okay so moving into the more affordable
high street options i found this really
great gray jump dress this is from
misguided this was 30 pounds and the one
bonus it does have is that it was a
perfect length for what I was actually
going for in the first place so this is
much shorter than the last jump dress
obviously it's not quite as luxurious of
course it's not but it is actually still
really soft it's got a great knit to it
it has this plaited detail down the
front for little extra very similar : it
kind of turns up so nice chunky color so
it's got a lot going on this and it's
actually really lovely 230 pounds pretty
good for the jacket I went with the
river island black aviator jacket now
this is 75 pounds so it's like a trip a
lesson Derby swamp obviously this isn't
sort of real shilling this house
kilobyte faux fur inserts and it's a bit
kind of swayed it style and faux
shearling all over for it is a really
really great option and in fact these
sleeves are kind of leather look style
it's got a lot going on it's quite cool
and it's also a slightly shorter length
so if you have to something a little bit
more fitted and shorter and this is
definitely much more of a go-to as well
but I'll also leave another link down
below for another a view it's very
similar I think it's about 20 pound more
and it is so so good in terms of kind of
comparing to the Reese one I just want
to go for the more affordable option
I'll leave that link down below as well
for the boots now they're probably our
more affordable versions than this but I
thought these were just very very
similar to Jean feetoes which is why I
wanted to go for these holes really this
is how they look I think they're pretty
similar that got much more of a stiletto
healed a lot of them do got pointed toe
very similar style in the black flayed I
mean these yummy tops don't have this
but a lot of the other boots I've seen
don't really have any detail at all the
Shelby does have a slit so I wanted to
kind of add something and I actually
really like this I think it really adds
something to it I think thriller lovely
so these are 149 pound not exactly the
cheapest on the market but I wanted to
get something actually to compare to the
show
Rito russy's I think these are pretty
good much and the final item is the bag
and I found this one from misguided now
there are I mean I'm leaving on the
plastic trucks or something to get back
it's for the purpose of video I don't
need anymore bags but there's a few
little differences I'll sit this is a
patent more peachy and does it have a
little strip yes and it comes just come
along strapped is the same as as you're
gonna shoot I'll show you them
side-by-side look how similar these are
we have this is a leather and this is a
patent but I mean look at the way this
is all been structured and the length of
the handles and the style of the
topicals at the side it is literally
such a jew very similar size of two so
if you're a big fan of this you phone
sheet and you're not really got the
funds for it this is a very similar
similar back so I thought I did pretty
well fair I actually as soon as I saw
this on the website was like no is that
just like as you want shout to gonna
yeah so I hope you think I did well
that's my peak of the whole High Street
outfit together and then we can have a
look at the two side-by-side
okay so which with your favorite let me
know down below in the comments I've
kind of got some favorites from each I
think that 30 pound jumper misguided is
brilliant and really thinking about so
keeping that obviously all of my
research kit and I love Michelle buteau
Rossi's but I think that I found some
really really good matches hope that you
