excited to introduce this brand new
series to this channel that I'm going to
be calling the luxury look for less and
it's pretty much self-explanatory
this is where I'm going to show you how
to get a full luxury lock with a super
similar aesthetic similar styling for so
much less money so I wanted to try this
out something completely new something
I've never seen anyone that I follow
especially two before I thought it would
work quite well because a lot of my
audience of luxury a lot of my own it's
full of high street and a lot of them
love to kind of intertwine the two
together which is how I usually style
myself so more kind of high street
pieces with luxury accessories now and
again I'll throw in a more luxury top
Pollock shoe jacket so to start with
what you can expect from the series I'm
going to try to do this at least once
every single month where I choose one
outfit that I'm really really enjoying
and I'm going to find a duplicate high
street much more affordable version for
anyone who prefers that one so that's
what you can kind of expect and I really
want to make this a regular thing so I
cannot which hey or feedback please you
leave me some feedback and comments down
below and like this video now if you're
kind of liking the whole idea and let's
start off with the luxury outfit first
so starting off with my main and most
favorite piece of this first looks your
outfit is this Burberry rucksack you've
probably seen these everywhere they were
all over catwalks
the Burberry Fashion Show had so many of
these in the show and I completely fell
in love with him when I saw them so when
they came out into the shops I was just
totally totally smitten it just got some
really cool elements that go into this
bag so gold hardware which goes into
these gorgeous gold straps at the back
this is all quilted black cotton it may
seem and it has these great textured
leather buckles and the same with the
handle so it sort of gold it's got this
cool tan leather and a very black fabric
and this is almost waterproof style
fabric it goes into this I mean look at
this book cause this is my favorite
thing on here
gorgeous so this backpack is 795 pounds
which on the scale of luxury backpacks
is on the kind of lower price scales I
think it's a lot more reasonable than
some of them are yes this is kind of the
main part of the outfit
okay the next piece is from All Saints
and this is a suede gray jacket with
silver hardware this time so it's got
these silver little buttons go all over
jack in different areas
silver zips and I really love this
plaited suede effect to the zips but
it's just a very simple but beautiful
suede jacket this was 420 pounds of
course everything will be listed down
below with all the prices but I really
really love this when I saw it I thought
it would be a piece I could get so much
yourself soft summer and for winter for
date nights for evenings out I really a
little bit okay to go with the outfit is
a pair of jeans these are pair of black
skinny jeans from seven from my kind
which is one of my absolutely favorite
jeans Brown so just seemed to fit me
really really well they're a super jet
black which I really love from skinny
black jeans yeah it's not much more I
can say about them then there are really
good for fit straight down into a great
skinny leg um two pockets to the firm so
simple all mankind here and it doesn't
there as well and two pockets in the
front with a silver bottom that we've
got a real other shape them a little
they're not quite they're not too high
waisted but they're definitely higher
than like a mid rise cut would be I
really love this style for the top in
the outfit I'm gonna go with the
template lace cream top I showed this
recently in a haul and like I said then
a total of it's so beautiful it's
gorgeous scalloped lace edging here the
full lace all over the whole product is
too stunning the jagged edges like
frayed edges
this is extremely special this is quite
cropped though and the top that I found
that very similar to this is more longer
although I'm going to try and tuck it in
and see how we go well the overall style
is so beautiful
this top was three
95 pounds but it's now reduced 197 so
it's actually half price at the moment
which is incredible for a top that I
absolutely adore but it was originally
395 and for accessories this outfit I'm
gonna go with my absolute favorite
ray-ban Club masters I've had these for
so long now they're a sunglass I
generous reach for when I'm about to run
out the door and I need a pair of
sunglasses quickly and I'm like these
suit me I know they go with every outfit
so thought I'd go with these because I
put this whole outfit together with
things I really love at the moment that
are also very much on trend as well so
and these have a lot of copies in the
market yes it's just a standard black
and gold pair in a regular sizing I love
these glasses so much and the last piece
in this outfit
are my Valentino sandals the Valentino
Roxas sandal are seven hundred and sixty
pounds to buy and in Valentino don't
make cheap shoes as you may already know
so these are somewhat pricey although
probably one of my most worn pairs of
shoes I mean there are a lot of
different dupes on the market for
Valentino especially with the studs
being quite easy to replicate but I do
wear these to debts and they were
perfect this outfit so I thought I'd try
and find some things that kind of
matches them is somewhat similar sister
I mean I wear these to death I
absolutely love them so that is part
about fit one so that is a full luxury
look let's get in to the dupes and the
more affordable versions first up and my
favorite group in this whole thing is
their bag so this bag is from new look
and it is 15 pounds 50 which is pretty
incredible for a backpack it's somewhat
similar in well it's very very similar
in terms of kind of textures and style
is gone into this bag and it's
completely black it's gold hardware it
has such an textured well these won't be
leather but leather style pieces on here
unfortunately obviously the straps don't
have the cool gold sections to them
because I'll play I've cost a lot more
for me to put into this bag but overall
you can definitely see the resemblance
in
to pull them up side by side you can
definitely see that resemblance but at
15 pound 50 this is definitely one for
the bargain hunter or someone who adores
Barry bag but can't afford this season
and wants to go for something quite
similar
next up too much the All Saints jacket I
found one from misguided and this was 40
pounds so 400 for the All Saints 40
pounds for this one of course this isn't
real suede this is a faux suede but I do
love these jackets I've had a few of
these in the past anyway and they're
just so great to throw on but have quite
similar features again a catch
silver hardware all over these cute
little silver sections silver buttons to
the collar as well and it has the same
on the very very tops of the shoulders
the only thing different with this is it
doesn't have the cool plaited sections
hanging from the zips but it does have
the waist belt the same as the All
Saints one and it's extremely extremely
similar okay so this was a template op
that I needed to find something similar
to and I feel I almost did it this is
from Y a s at a sauce this is what it
looks like so it's very similar and it's
got this friend edging same as the
template browse it's got the lace floral
all over long sleeves the only
difference with this one is that it's a
little longer than the template browser
simply one is cropped this is normal
size but if you just took it into jeans
you can kind of get rid of a little bit
that length but it also has this sort of
scalloped edging to it this one is
frayed where is this one is completely
lace but it's a very very similar in
style it was a pretty great tube and
with this being 395 this is 43 pounds so
quite a significant amount lower follow
jeans I found some very very similar
from ASOS silver book called two pockets
two pockets to the balm and skinny very
very jet-black look Jean and these are
20 pound so again big decrease then for
accessories I
found a pair of club master dupes these
are eight pounds which I think it's
pretty amazing the normal rate of anklet
masters around 120 pounds so they're so
so similar I ridiculous the similar
these though are silver black whereas my
originals are golden black but I thought
pretty amazing group and for shoes
something to almost replicate Valentino
rocks of sandal I found these these were
on a sell Caesar by brown called call it
spring so far of this shoe with the
branch down the middle and sections
going off it with the studing all over
it in triangles and circles very very
very similar to this one the main
difference is that this one is a
slightly short heel and this one is a
higher heel but I felt overall that was
a pretty good joob so these are fifty
pounds whereas the Valentino's are seven
hundred and sixty pounds so fifty pound
is still slightly more on the
high-priced side for high street but yet
a pretty great dude for seven hundred
sixty pounds shoe so that was my luxury
look for Less what did you think which
was your favorite outfit or which was
your favorite piece overall I mean
obviously I'm a huge fan of the Burberry
backpack I think it's absolutely
beautiful if you are a more of a budget
the new-look Guan could be right up your
street hopefully you enjoyed this whole
format and you liked the way so to put
together but please leave me feedback
because I love to carry the series on
and I'd love to know how maybe you'd
like me to shoot it differently on what
you prefer to see just let me know or if
you liked it overall again just leave me
some nice positive comments I'd love to
see what you thought about it please
like the video as again that gives me a
massive inclination as to whether to
film these even more and if you're new
