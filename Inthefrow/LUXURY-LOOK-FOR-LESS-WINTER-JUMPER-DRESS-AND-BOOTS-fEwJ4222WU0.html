new luxury look for this video this is
gonna be the first of two actually right
before Christmas I've wanted to film a
couple of these because I did say I
wanted to film them monthly and I'm not
quite managed it cuz it doesn't take me
so long to find these products I'll be
honest but I found two outfits that
could kind of compare so I'm filming one
for now and one will be up in a few
weeks time as well however first before
I get into luxury look for less I've
actually got something really really
exciting that I want to announce you
guys seeing as christmas is coming up
and if i'm doing vlogmas i was thinking
about doing froma things and I really
really enjoyed it and I'm so sorry to
everyone who's asked me since I'm doing
it again I'm not actually going to be
doing fromin so instead I thought about
doing something different so I'd like to
announce to you what I was doing over
Christmas which is my seven days of
Christmas giveaways hashtag so the idea
of this is that there are several videos
from today before the 21st of December
each of those seven videos starting from
today will have a giveaway prize at the
very very end of the video so it's
something I've pulled together that I
really really wanted to give away to you
guys
it's either round absolutely love
products that I really really door or
just a gifts that I think you can dice
or Maps love I've got some pretty thank
you and I cannot wait to show you them
and give them away and just kind of
treat you as a Christmas gift so just
gonna give you a bit of sneak peek let's
just say there are give a prizes from
Giorgio Armani wives Dell GHD LMS heels
ever decay Smashbox Make Up For Ever
Galan shibashi Kenzo Victor roll I've
also missed so many out there but
they're just let so say there's a lot of
incredible price so I really really hope
you guys enjoy it so the way it works is
each video will have a giveaway and in
each
yeah at the end of the giveaway you'll
also be told who won the previous
giveaway so for example today I'll be
showing you giveaway price won and in
Wednesday's video I'll be announcing the
giveaway winner and then on Wednesday
we're now seeing the second giveaway and
then the Sunday after that I'll be
announcing who won the second giveaway
kind of works like that so you kind of
get three or four days to enter each
giveaway so where it's gonna work is
this is that I'm gonna have a blog post
on in the fro calm which is gonna be
where you will enter the giveaway it
just kind of keeps it easier and it'll
be out before like a Rafflecopter
giveaway for now I'll be super simple
you can follow me here there and
everywhere and they'll give you one more
entry into the giveaway but there are
seven prizes in total that I've kind of
made up of a few different prizes so if

three really great prices within your
prime make sure as well that you put in
your email address when you're signing

conditions of the giveaway will also be

restriction on it because all this
beauty products there's no kind of like
half of products or anything in there
obviously if you're under age make sure
you ask your parents if they're mine too
giving out an email address on your
address I can send you the products yes
so generally those kind of things really
but yeah good luck so let's get into
this first looks you for Less video if
you've never seen it looks you look for
Less pretty much I just find one full
luxury outfit and I try and find a very
comparable outfit on the
Street that is much more affordable so
let's get right into it the first luxury
item is this I am so in love with this
this is from the Tommy and Gigi
collection you may know already I have
like the knitwear top love it love it to
bits this is kind of very similar but
it's a jumper dress it's so chunky super
beautiful really beautiful wall material
it's just an uber chunky knit and I love
right now but it has some special pieces
on here like this little patch some
contrasting blue stripes that go across
the center and on the arms as well so it
goes across the center at the back the
front doesn't have it across the middle
there but it just adds a little bit
extra detail but I absolutely fell in
love with it as soon as I saw it yes I
wanted to kind of fill the outfit almost
around there so this Tommy Hilfiger and
Gigi Hadid collaboration knitwear is 250
pounds I had to get this Reef's jacket
into a nice luxury look for lesses
because I kind of wanted to challenge
myself to find some things that was
comparable to this in the high street
I'll be honest with you I found it so
difficult there isn't really anything
out there like this this big faux fur
collar
I literally scoured for hours trying to
find something but I found something
that kind of works that you'll see soon
but this is the incredible wreath long
coat with a faux fur collar it's in a
beautiful almost like very subtle taupe
blush beige it's absolutely beautiful I
love this coat to bits
so this coat from Reese is 395 pounds
with that I paired it with a mulberry
colored scarf this is from end peel this
is a Kashmir it's a stunning kind of
muscle fabric there's very muscled
colors here and sort of deep purple mix
of violets so I find it kind of very
morbid very kind of a wine shade and
it's just a really beautiful cashmere
scarf so I wanted to find obviously I
couldn't find cashmere that was really
affordable on the high street I'll be
honest but I tried to find something a
very similar kind of mold so you can see
how I did so this scarf from NPL is 109
pounds for booty of course I had to
feature this as well my true Sardi boots
again I wanted to kind of challenge
myself to find something quite similar
these are one pricey boot these are 829
pounds but I must admit I've worn them
so much I love them they're a gorgeous
gorgeous boot I mean looks like he'll
it's just incredible so I try to find
something somewhat similar for you guys
in the high street I hope it it okay
okay so the bag which I think is the
most comparable piece that I found I
think I found a really really good kind
of similar piece on high street yes the
incredible Chloe Fae in the gray now
this is all still tagged up I'm sending
it back you'll be happy to know I just
wanted to get this for the sake of this
video so it kind of gave you a really
good impression of everything in the
video I don't do things by halves here
so yes so I'm sending it back so
obviously that isn't part of it it's
just a gold chain which attaches up
there I'm sure you've seen the clothing
before but this is just such an
incredible bag but I didn't actually
ever buy it in the size I have the
smaller version in the town I always
have my eye on this style I think
tomorrow has this one it's actually
beautiful but I really want to get this
to kind of show you it as part of the
outfit so the quality is 1280 pounds so
that it's all of a luxury outfit let's
have a look at all of that together
okay so moving into the Hang Street
outfit I had to find something that kind
of match the Tommy Hilfiger jumper dress
I found something sort of similar this
is more oatmeal vote than the creamy
white of Tommy Hilfiger wow this is
Marvin oatmeal cream shade it's a jumper
dress again and it's a chunky knit so
it's kind of got a similar vibe you can
turn this over to give it a lot of
structured next Arace them to the Tommy
Hilfiger well and it's a really great
link from this actually I feel for how
affordable it's all this is with 38
pounds I think it's a really good option
if you're after a jumper dress so as I
was saying about the jacket I found it
extremely hard to find anything that
compared to that reeked swath so I did
find this jacket and this is more of a
grayish color it's got loads of fluff on
it that's from the scarf which you will
see next anyway so this is Mara Calgary
she toned very kind of similar not quite
as blush not quite as many pink tones in
here this is more of a stony grayish
beige but it's got quite a similar shape
very similar kind of length it doesn't
have any buttons oh so you can't button
it up it's a little bit annoying but the
overall style of it I mean it's got
pockets it's got a big collar it's not
got the faux fur or anything but I did
my best and this is literally the kind
of nearest somewhat style that I could
find the Reiss coat is 3 9 5 this was 60
pounds so it's quite a lot less but if
you didn't really like the faux fur
collar then I thought you could get a
fur collar to wear with it I mean this
isn't quite the size of the Reese when
it's not quite as big and quite as white
and cream but you never know if you have
a KO already anyone I kind of mix it up
and make it look a bit more like the
reefs one this could be good to go for
it is 20 pounds for the scarf option I
found this one which is 12 pound and
this is huge like it's twice a length
and twice the width off the NPL scarf so
it's a lot for you money obviously it's
not cashmere but it is kind of molting a
little bit beyond its but it is really
snug and really soft and
lovely piece actually I think my mom
would probably love this for Christmas
and it's a 12-pound okay now Susie's I
did my best to find some shoes match the
chessani boots in the most affordable
way obviously there wasn't something
completely the same because they're
quite unique catched on the market the
mode which i think is why I love them so
much but I did find two that somewhat
similar characteristics
so first pair being these so I've got
that kind of burnished brown red styled
boot and they also have this marbled
effect don't you can see that marbled
effect heel this one though is in kind
of white and black rather than the
tortoiseshell shades but it's got a very
similar vibe the Reds and the muscles
marbled staff heel not quite the height
of the Tristana boots either put some
very similar characteristics on these
bars these boots are actually 75 pound
but I also found these which are a bit
more violet than the red but they're a
bit taller as well they've not got the
heel unfortunately but I just felt that
the fact they were more suede as well
matched a little bit more and actually
we just really liked these as well I
thought these are quite cool option got
a bit of a sock feel going on with them
it's just huge at the moment and they're
actually really really comfortable so
those are what I went for
these boots aren't the most inexpensive
though they are still 122-pound but they
are with a nice tomato good quality
boots but I tried my best guys and the
final piece to match the Chloe Fae is
this one seriously how similar is this
the only difference is is it doesn't say
Chloe here this isn't a chain strap I
don't know really why this is like this
I don't know maybe you meant to kind of
do this some kind of carrot like this
maybe or potentially you could hop it
through there and create a bit of bow
it's kind of cute actually it's really
cute this is 22 pounds so like a
thousand two hundred pounds off so it's
actually really really good it's such an
amazing June if you're looking for the
Chloe Fei Jie I was pretty stunned when
I saw this actually it also has the same
opening as the Chloe and very similar
space I'm not quite
much space I'm gonna say but still I
thought it was such a good Jew I hope
you think so too
let's see all that outfit together and
we'll have a look at the two
side-by-side you can kind of compare the
two
okay so that was it it looks you look
for less I really hope you enjoyed it

amazing matches if you're looking to
