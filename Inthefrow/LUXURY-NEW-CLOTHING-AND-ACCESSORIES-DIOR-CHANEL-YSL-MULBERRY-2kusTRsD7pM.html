sat back down on my bed filming it
someday video I realize it's been quite
a while and quite a few who've asked me
where I was with this sample videos and
then I'll sit down chats videos and it
just because we're almost moved now
we've got a week and a half less until
we can finally move and when I start
kind of I'm so excited about filming in
my new place that I've been like super
uninspired to film here because I can
see the backdrop is just bizarre I'm
just so fed up of it I did want to film
some videos for you before we did leave
and first I want to film is response so
I'm going to go through my latest luxury
designer things I've picked up in the
past few months so it's been a while
since I've done something like this so
I've got jewelry effort clothing and I
have accessories yeah lots of gorgeous
things to show you some quite exciting
access so let's just jump right into
this let's kick this off with jewelry
first thing are these earrings which you
may have seen if you've been watching my
vlogs these are some new Dior Christian
Dior trifle earrings they are pill one
side and on the other side it was gold
olden round ball that's a CD on the top
with a fit through here and then you
attach the pearl or the back and Alex
got me these as a birthday gift actually
but I absolutely adore them I haven't
taken them off and I've often been
sleeping in them because I'm really
comfortable so those are my newest
earrings I'm in love with another set of
earrings out that I have as well you may
have noticed these in some pictures I
took recently and they are these
earrings I don't know what any other
droplet long earrings at all and I saw
these totally fell in love with and I
don't know what it was it was absolutely
love them and decided to go for it I
thought this events if I'm wearing my
hair up and some beautiful long floaty
dresses this could look absolutely and
then you think I mean they're not white
gold they are stainless steel I think I
absolutely adore them I'll leave links
down below by the way what you Sean
whose that's by oh you dear
yeah links will be down below from where
I got them from Sophia Linux jewelry and
then another piece of joy and
so absolutely in love with is this
necklace I don't know where I've been on
the whole large horn necklace trend
I feel like Susan Amelia totally have
this light last year but it's only
recently that I've been like actually
really really like that so I picked one
up from a soma a little bit so much this
is kind of where it would lie it says
it's a pendant I kind of hoped it will
also longer I'll be honest I still
really really love it but I would also
love to find one somewhere that's almost
twice the size of this like a really big
chunky one but I absolutely adore this
it doing it's so stunning and that
jewelry then it has some accessories
I've got some sunglasses first pair I
picked up from some Basha shop that's a
pair of Dior so real pops how great
these with this Lila key purple shade
and the gold frame as in Havana kind of
tortoiseshell catch up it here feels all
kind of like flimsy but absolutely
beautiful I love them it's like a pop of
color they're just super fun and I
really love these two your cases I feel
like these like the brand-new Dior cases
thousands right you so but recently but
any of your losses are brought up in
these and they're really quite masks and
they kind of pack together inside your
drawers kind of like this and they also
kind of like magnetized together it's
very handy if you got the past but I
didn't also get another pair this is I
got from bloomingdales when I was in New
York I had a personal shopping trip and
I wanted to get something from there so
he saw that's long Ellis eNOS I'll leave
that blog linked on the screen in case
you didn't but these other pair I picked
up there and in love with them I haven't
bought a pair of like very statement
black sleek glasses in quite some time
so I'm totally obsessed with ease and I
was so pleased when I saw that Natalie
Portman was wearing these in a recent
your advert and I was like yes good
taste naturally our good taste of your
stylist Natalie I leave a link down
below cost and where you can get those I
know it can be quite difficult to find
different types of some waxes sometimes
let's go on to some shoes first pair
totally digging right now this new pair
from balloons three years the arthur
montana compete in a grave lack Markram
this is a leather this is the leather
and saving grace ways throughout this
stunning lichens got home from wearing
these out we've been out about the
breakfast we're going to Whole Foods and
absolutely love them they're so
beautiful on with this full open section
where scratch the cross spot stunning
absolutely love these two bits so those
are kind of my newest heel purchase and
I mentioned these are the shoes just in
case you didn't see them at all but my
Chanel sneakers I haven't had much
chance to wear these yet so don't go out
in the rain it's been raining a lot
also with them being like a velvet
velvet and it's like a coated leather I
think but they're super space-age and
I'm absolutely in love with them still
and I got these again from Chicago so if
you're not in that hall and what's that
hole okay so moving into closing first
thing I picked up an item taken at a
gracias
yes can I have to wear it I bought
myself the Christian Dior bra that was
here last season it's here this season
it's just one of those pieces that if
you are wearing a cool band owl dress
and you want to put on a bra under it
then you've got this gorgeous stretch
please Christine your straps and leaf
which is really gorgeous and you could
wear it was really cool blazer or
something that's more mesh on the top or
more sheer so you can see the straps
through it or if you're really ready to
square this and a really cool pair of
high-waisted like very wide leg cool
Palazzo style pants would look
absolutely stunning so I bought this
just in the hopes that I'll have a
really cool event to wear it for and I
love it in complete honesty I was
searching for this top for probably six
to eight months of fun gotten in it was
in a medium but I had the in-house
tailor that do your take in for me so
it's it's more like a small now bear
that in mind if you do manage to find it
definitely try it on and check if your
size I went for this black jumper when I
saw it love this is from Louisville Roma
from market looks just really easy cozy
sweat with the cute little lips design
on there again it's just for something
to kind of wear when I'm traveling I'll
say I do a lot of traveling to run when
I'm traveling or when and having more of
a chill day and going out for meetings
and I was throw on something that's
going to comfy and cozy and warm and
it's just like a cool slightly long
oversized style and really easy blacks
where that thought it was super cute oh
my gosh this jumper is absolutely winner
guys I found this online it's a j.crew
sweat I found online and literally was
like the price of that got to be wrong
with 260 pound for a j.crew sweater
it's a beautiful fabric if I could
greymouth where it's not thin rain means
it's not mega thick either it's not thin
absolutely beautiful soft material then
it helps you cute bow designs too so we
used to pull the links are quite a wide
sleeve it just fits so nicely and it was
60 pounds they're doing a few other
colors I think I'm going to buy other
colors as well because I literally
cannot believe just helped inexpensive
this is for quality of it's a bit of it
in fact as a j.crew sweater it feels I
was like I put it in my basket first of
all tough like that price isn't right
they're going to show you that price any
minute it's so like I'm going behind it
quick before we do and I have so many
compliments on it I've won actually
chance and Instagram and loads people
have asked me where it's from so I had
to mention it and yes I love to be
buying the navy blue ASAP - I also got
this little top if you know me well you
will know I have been digging kind of
white teeth recently especially that
L'Oreal tea that I got but you can't
even buy so I saw this and thought this
is super cute it's got summer on the
front and it's got lips that smoking and
it's got an X through it which very much
matches my perspective on smoking as
well it's awesome very cute easy flat CT
I got it in small font it to be a little
bit more oversized and I will probably
also just turn the sleeves up when I
wear it as well so it's a little bit
more fitted round there but then just
took this into jeans it looks really
really cute and I actually really really
like this a lot you know I'm like I can
really collect it with white we're all
seasons ago super tailored sophisticated
style some
even's I just want to go like more lazy
slouchy chilled what kind of dressup in
my own way and guess that supply sermon
right now
okay the last two things to show you our
bags of course same time most exciting
to the last I guess first bag that I
picked up recently is this one from all
Britain since and more bright and early
in oxblood I didn't realize I'm use this
bag until I've got it and I absolutely
love it too bit she's actually gifts and
mulberry if you saw that flog as well
which is just incredible gift to get so
it's got the gorgeous suede oxblood on
the inside as well
loads of room in here absolutely loads
of room I've been using for the travel
bag it's been a fantastic travel bags
it's it's absolute lows inside of here
it's got a great length on this you can
sort of wear it crossbody if you like
and can also play around with a length
of the strap from it to be a little bit
shorter and I have just added a Diaw
scarf on to mine and just a little bit
more personalization as we're going to
love this new style bangle that we've
got going on I think mob really kind of
pull out now pull out all stops and
create some really cool pieces so I'm
super excited to see what they do this
season and of course my very final and
most exciting purchase that I made
recently was for my own birthday and it
is the deal you're addict flap bag I
literally walked into the routine comp
on Street saw it fell in love with it I
was going to get a black and a slight
and grey then I sort in this they do
look gorgeous on fence duck-egg Keowee
blue it's much more of a darker blue so
I was between arms we took about our to
the side a final up like no any grey
bags absolutely love it and if you have
seen my Instagram recently you'll assume
that I haven't taken it off and I got it
if it every single Instagram carried on
with the whole Maria gratia theme as
this very kind of dolls antique style
gold all the way through it so my food
for details it's a chain strap with the
CD over every single link you can also
get the bag without the siblings but as
it will absolutely love the studying a
thought it was stunning and very
different to anything else I have it
unlocks for the two princes here and
inside this at one pocket here and a
larger pocket as well
oh and yet
socket at the back so it's actually
quite roomy enough to sit quite a bit in
here especially because it opens up here
and you can see how much you've got
stuffed inside that's how much this is
kind of pushed out but I'm really really
obsessed with this so I'm so pleased I
got it and I love it and that is
absolutely everything guys so I picked
up recently I think in the mall kind of
a luxury premium designer kind of
category so a few things in here that
roughly a little bit lower a little bit
lower end and then the others but I'm
