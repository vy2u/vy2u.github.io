y'all doing so so well this is gonna be
an unboxing video
I've not filmed an unboxing video for so
long so it's gonna be a quick unboxing
of what I picked up at Louise's ear room
let's get right into this bag so the
cool box if you don't know of Louie's
via roma I think this is a brand based
in Florence and they stock a lot of
luxury designer pieces accessories bags
clothing shoes and it's somewhere I go
to pretty much every month to have a lot
of newest things they've got em quite
often they'll have more unique pieces
things that you might not find on other
websites things that often even more
high-fashion down to say your average
other store maybe say like Selfridges or
my teens that often I find they're
buy-in and everything that they sell on
that store is how to look at mug unique
and quite cool so I really really love
this store and I was having a look on
the other day and saw too many pieces I
absolutely fell in love with so I
thought I'd show you let's open up this
back so there are two things in here and
I don't know which one show you first
okay so this is a pair of Malone juniors
heels again I'm not too sure if that's a
quick way of pronounce now pretty sure
it must be Malone so yeah so yeah so
yeah yeah but I might just be putting
too much of my kind of French sounding
spinet Malone
sylia either way beautiful so I really
miss Brown and the issues very similar
to a pair
I saw last year and was so smitten with
them and they kind of sold out
everywhere and then I stole it brought
them back but in slightly different
stay old okay and to really really love
these they are so they are think this is
a 10 centimeter heel pointed toe because
I always go through pointy toes and
simply look a little bit more sexier
especially for my kind of shape it's
like bit more and the ones that I've
seen in the past they have the two
straps like this but they kind of coffee
here they didn't have this top bit so
almost like home to you fought and they
were so sexy but then I saw these
different brought outwards extra ankle
strap and the hips to the back and just
really love the colors and navy with
silver I thought which is so beautiful
so I thought I'd give them a go it's a
really really beautiful suede this is
kind of like a patent silver leather
it's a very flat ordinary soul yeah okay
so so far so good and the next thing I
picked up was from San LaRon I saw this
last month and just thought this was one
of those more affordable I say for all
because usually things are kind of a
thousand-pound and this is under five
hundred pound so I kind of felt it's a
sort of thing that a lot of you guys
were thinking of investing in your first
examine piece might love the look off
because it's a little bit more
affordable but also super sweet and it
looks like how cute this is a little
wire sell it called the blogger bag
which of course straightway outside this
is cute blog about and it's almost a
perfect size for a camera so like a
little mini vlogging camera this is so
perfect
did you know I don't even think it will
fit my phone okay it doesn't fit my
phone but it will fit other things at
least and quite often I don't actually
have my phone in my bag
it's just I use it so often when it
comes on a long strap a really thin long
strap and here I can take this off ok
here is a little tassel on the side
that's seriously adorable isn't it and
some of the fact that it comes with gold
hardware it's a smooth lever I don't
really have much in smooth leather but I
feel that the more I use it the more
it'll kind of give my personality and
the level kind of go really lovely and
and soft and the big wire cells running
the gold is lovely and it also has a
little back pocket get a card in there
if you wanted to but it's that kind of
perfect over shoulder length as well oh
yes under five from Japan at least so
for anyone that's thinking I really want
to invest in something or you real of
sound the Romney you want something from
there but you don't really have enough
to spend on maybe a thousand pound bag
1500 pound bag like the up dinar that's
would be quite a nice little investment
piece
it's got a few little cardholder
sections yeah the count is just kind of
thing you could place fit a few
lipsticks your cash your keys
camera and you'd be good to go but of
course if you've got an iPhone 6 plus
etcetera so and iPhone 5 would fit in
there
and iPhone 6 would fit in there and
iPhone 6 plus definitely doesn't but I
think that it's adorable and I feel like
I'm gonna get so much use out of this
it's like a camera bag so she's like
Fashion Week and everything if I just
want to carry my small camera around
with me this is gonna be so perfect
there or even maybe in the airport is so
where to kind of carry my passport and
documentation things this could also be
quite sweet yeah
so that is it this a little unboxing I
really hope you enjoyed it still though
let me know down below in the comments
if you prefer the bag if you prefer the
shoes I'll be back soon with another
video if you're new then please
