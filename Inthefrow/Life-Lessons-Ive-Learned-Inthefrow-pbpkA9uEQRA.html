to film something a little bit out of
the norm not so much about products and
materialistic possessions but more about
self and thoughts feelings emotions and
life lessons seeing as my 26th birthday
is coming up this month that I would
almost reminisce back on what exactly I
have learned over the past 26 years in
order to impart some of my knowledge
unto you guys in 99% of cases hard work
will always pay off relationships really
are hard work and it's all about working
out which ones are worth that hard work
and which ones are not there are a lot
of friends in your life that will let
you down and there are a lot of friends
in your life that will surprise you and
always be there for you and it's making
sure that you stick with those loyal
friends for as long as you possibly can
you don't have to give in to peer
pressure if one of your friends is doing
something that you don't want to do just
say you don't want to do it it doesn't
make you uncork brain and your own
knowledge of what exactly you do and
don't want to do this goes for smoking
drinking having sex too soon any of
those things that you feel that you're
not ready for yet success does not
happen overnight you need to take lots
of little steps to try and reach your
end goal you'll not wake up one day
overly successful instead it'll take you
lots little steps to get exactly to
where you want to be this goes for in
education and work in Fitness in health
and absolutely everything that you do
I'll always be a little baby steps of
them help you reach your end target it
comes to a point where you need to
forgive and forget the particular things
that may have happened to you or else it
will start to consume your life so best
to forget it and move on there's new
cheats on you and doesn't see you as
special enough to be with just you it's
definitely not worth your time travel as
much as you possibly can it is one of
the best things you can possibly do
don't waste your time
on being jealous instead put that energy
into positive feelings of thoughts of
how you could potentially better
yourself in one particular way you will
never be able to please everyone you
don't always get what you want and
that's not necessarily a bad thing it
just means that perhaps the thing that
happens instead was meant to happen in
the first place
life is far too sure and sometimes it's
taken away from beautiful people far far
too soon and it's worth spending more
time with those that you really really
love to really make the most of every
single day whilst you may feel alone in
whatever you may be feeling or thinking
at one particular time remember that
everyone is going through those emotions
whether it's anger frustration sadness
depression doubt grief jealousy at some
point in everyone's life they will also
feel these emotions so don't feel like
you have to lock yours up I'll hide them
away talk to someone about it and try
and ask them their opinions and get a
second opinion how you may be feeling
and just let somebody help you nobody
has it all figured out if you do
something that you particularly love
whether it's dancing playing music
singing acting or any other hobby if you
really love it try not to give it up
without really thinking about it I've
given up some my most amazing hobbies
far too soon without really thinking
them through and it's been my biggest
regret in life love is not just about
traction it's not just about falling for
someone's looks it's so much more deeper
than that
it's about personality it's by humor
about someone's principles and morals
and emotions and how they act don't be
fooled by the way that someone looks
make sure that you work to live and not
live to work if you have something
negative to say just don't say it
respect that everyone has their own
opinions well so you might have a very
strong feeling about something someone
else may like to have a different
opinion and everyone will have a
different opinion about every
thing leaving your makeup on before you
sleep is really really bad for your skin
if you think you've drank too much the
chances are that you probably already
have so put down the drink pick up a
glass of water and carry on enjoying
your night you do not need to keep
drinking alcohol to enjoy your evening
and saying that you don't have to drink
alcohol whatsoever if you don't want to
never change yourself to someone else I
feel that everyone needs to spend time
alone and single in order to find
themselves and to love themselves fully
before they can then lost someone else
heartbreak is one of the most horrible
emotions to go through but you will
always come out of it so much stronger
education sets you up for the rest of
your life whilst you might be hating
school at a time you will be learning so
so much that you can use for the rest of
your life in your future so don't take
it too much for granted
I'm sure there's so much more I could
say but that is all there is almost half
of my head hopefully you've taken
something from this and I would love to
hear it so many more of your life
lessons just leave them down in the
comments below let me know what you've
learned in your years so far we can all
kind of discuss it down below in the
comments thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
