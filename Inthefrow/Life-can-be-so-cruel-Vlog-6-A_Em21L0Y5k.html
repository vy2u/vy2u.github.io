of straw
practically living in sports prowess
right now don't even know I own actual
bra because there's no point around I'm
just in such like a good things right
now good fitness phase
it feels great having larva routine only
because we haven't been away now in a
little while and we're used to going
away every two weeks at least and
recently I just really wanted to have
more of a routine be at home see my
friends go to the gym get my body on
track and just fit a little bit better
so that's why a lot of you slog has
specially been at home where it's
usually this would just not happen like
it wouldn't be at home this much so it's
actually really really nice being at
home having some time together just
chillin and having more of a routine
which has been amazing so yes so because
no day another gym session you know I
think that still at this point in my
life like I'm nearly 28 see a lot of
horrible things and seeing people do a
lot of really crappy things but people
still manage to shock me and I'm like I
just I can't believe some people
sometimes I get on Twitter and I saw
that the what is it one love for
Manchester tickets are on sale for the
amazing concert that's been held by
ariana grande Justin Bieber so many
massive artists all the charity all for
the victims of the horrible Boeing's in
Manchester which affect so many people
people got tickets and yet some people
have the family did this is a great way
to make profit and to sell them on for
hundreds of pounds more than they're
worth I just can't get in my head why
someone can be such a scumbag this is
not about them making profit this is
about something really atrocious that
happened fair enough I sang correct as
these people are then going to give that
money to charity I don't think that's
the right way to go round it but these
people are most likely 99.99% of them
are going to be keeping that profit for
themselves and I think it's absolutely
disgusting I can't go ahead
that rant over the listen for happiness
Planner I saw a lot of people recently
trying out these Diaries what they
called this it's got the happens planet
I will leave a link down below I'm sorry
I'm not too sure where this came from

really liked about this is that it's got

things about today about things about
today what grateful for etc it's just

trying to make a conscious effort to do

super big and bushy
because I had them dies I'm going excess
hair but kind of like fill them even
more so on my lips is Mina spice liner

number one of the top stuff and glossy
and literally just wearing the brows and
try
to show my fault right now time to on my
dress like is my dress

put on your dress that you realize that
you've not really got I'm not make upon
or the wrong kind of makeup I absolutely
love this dress they're so beautiful
this little red self-portrait number of
course what else would I wear to his
thang over shorts do my hair think I'm
going to use my PhD this is my favorite
wand

flat on one side like this and that's
like that I'm trying to leave a link
down below for chon if I love it I want
to use a bit of dry shampoo as well is
my favorite red can pull up roof blow
dry is what I'm using to curl it at the
heat it spray from Studio Pro L'Oreal
Paris okay so and she usually spray this
all over you've probably seen this so
many times before
why it's wet in the back good nice
simple junk
let's wrap it around and try and keep
the piece of hair flat so you don't to
twist the piece of hair when you pin it
on to curler or else this is going to go
a bit funny mixed in you have to keep it
quite thick then let it drop off and
then pull it leave it to cool a bit what
sort of pulling out a bit straighter and
then let it get and then when those
aren't brushed out to go a bit more you
know the more began to hold like that we
should probably get into mind I'll leave
it like this or do I set the top bill
