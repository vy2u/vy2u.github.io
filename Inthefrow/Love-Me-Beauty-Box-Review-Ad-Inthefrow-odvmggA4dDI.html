video I am trying to get so many videos
out at the moment because I feel like I
was away for so long does a week with
one thing or another so I'm just trying
to get loads videos out that I've been
meaning to film and this is a video of a
meaning to film for quite a while now
the product that I want to share with
you today is the love me beauty box you
might be aware of subscription boxes I
especially a couple years back I got
really obsessed with subscription boxes
a real love the idea that someone sends
you products that matched your
preferences to your home and you could
try them out so I tried a few of the
subscription boxes that were out there
and recently I got to trial of meet
beauty box guys sent me over some just
to try out see what I thought balance I
could let you all know really wanted to
to be honest because a lot of the people
that watched my channel are in the kind
of age ranges that would be quite
interested in this kind of box I know
that people like me may be quite
interested to see what's this about
is this a subscription box I should sign
up to just to give you a bit of a
rundown written review of what if I
could to expect if you signed up to love
me beauty so hopefully you'll enjoy it
so this is a box as it arrived in the
post it rise straight to your door for
you and when you open it up when you
open it up it looks like this inside
you've got them for box it says slip
slip and on it it says hello welcome to
the beauty revolution it's great to have
you along welcome to the front line it's
got a nice little notes say hello first
of all that's a really good EQ very
might I haven't seen these yet I've only
opened this box they're far as the
cenotes like this inside so I haven't
actually even seen this if I wanted it
to be on camera what I thought about it
straight away so you get a little box
and it says lovely view the other from
get into the box
and inside you have a little white bag a
little sort of cotton linen and style
drawstring bag which is really cute I
love these kind of things they're so
handy for when you got away on holiday
and you want to take all of your brushes
away with you I'm gonna take some
cosmetics away they're super handy to
have with you so actually we like like
to these kind of things okay first thing
I see is this from Lord and berry
it's the polish or polish Polish polish
Polish I pencil in mirror black looks
really nice I'm always a need of new
black kohl eyeliner see honest this is
really really quite helpful and I'm
gonna give it a little cheeky swatch
just we can both trap together oh right
so it's really really creamy and really
easy to go on and in fact I've never
really had a bad Lord and berry product
I feel that Lord and Barry is sold in
quite unusual places
they're quite often in these
subscription boxes but whenever I've
tried in the book but if always have
been really really good but I have one
of their lip liners and absolutely love
it's one my favorite lip liners ever and
I just sort of tried it one day I was
like where is this being on my life so
that's really really nice I really like
that and the lids on the floor put that
back on a second product this is the
person read oh my goodness shine and
fragrance spray so it's a little spray a
nice little travel-size Drakon well a
Miss on to dry style hair wait 50
seconds before touching your hair should
we give it a gang should give me to go
together
oh god it said dr. J didn't it smell
nice it so much would have a gleam to it
actually I don't was that before or not
okay but nice I'm shy and sprays are
something I've never really bought into
to be honest I know a lot of people do
you like Shan sprays and silk a sow that
people do like shines brave I'm more of
a kind of hair spray girl and I like to
use kind of oils and things when I'm
drying my hair and then don't really add
much after it try not to have too much
products on top so although this is
really with a nice it's like something
out of the woods by myself so in a way
it's good that I've got this little
tester because I could try it out see if
I love it and if I do start to love it I
can then go out and buy it and that's
what's so good about these subscription
boxes I think because you can find some
beauty gems you would never found for
and then they could become your favorite
so that's really good actually I quite
like that okay next thing in the bag is
this lip balm from Malin and gets thing
that's always it
it's Mohito lip balm that's quite it's
got that kind of clinical looking cool
packaging so it looks like you're
pledging a pretty good job let's try
this out it's got quite a thick sort of
almost like a saline but a little bit
kind of stickier whoa it's got a very
kind of subtle mint flavor scent like my
ito I get it I get it may you tell lip
balm that makes it that seems really
nice at the moment I've got lipstick on
so I'm not gonna try it but what I might
do is put into my handbags I've got it
and I can give it a really good go you
never know if I absolutely adore it it
might come on in my favourites or it
might end up on a blog post as well so
we'll see but I really like the idea of
that a lot
next thing is whoa OPI nail lacquer this
is in the shade my little petunia and
it's a really gothic
dark romantic purple really gothic I'm
not going to like actually so that's
really quite nice I'm pretty sure the
OPI nail lacquers are around 8 to 11
pound if you buy them in the shop so
that's more than this box it's so pretty
good value so I've got to get a
full-size OPI as well I like that and
then the final thing is a bronze buffer
self-tan remover soft cushiony sponge
okay so I think this is like a little
sponge little sour sponge and use it to
exfoliate itself town it's really
tightly packed foam it's like really
tightly packed it must be really good at
exfoliating and with just a little water
bronze book for this gentle exfoliation
removes unwanted self-tanner
oh okay so you must put it under water
rinse out there and then use it on like
elbows he needs and these areas in your
face you've got some bad stuff tan going
out and cool that's really really good I
like that largely I do like fake tanners
and I use them quite often not recently
it's freezing in here that's actually a
really brilliant box I'm actually really
really impressed cool thing about love
me beauty though is that you get when
you sign up you get six tokens per month
which you can spend on building your own
box you sign up put your all your
preferences so it asks you a you G like
hair body skincare makeup do you like
nail varnish if things like that so you
putting on your preferences and filter
it through until it comes up with a full
preference about what you really want to
get in your box then it shows your list
of products that you potentially would
be really interested in and then you get
to spend six tokens on those so you get
six three tokens per month and then you
can put things into your box to put on
how much they are so most things rather
tude
tokens if they're a large size product
although one token if they're travel
size so technically each month you could
build a box of six small travel sized
products for six tokens or you could
build a box of three full-size products
for six tokens they're two tokens each
so it's quite cool so you can build your
own box and I've not actually ever seen
a subscription service where you could
build your own box before so I really
like
concept because you're not going to get
products that you don't like or but you
don't really want to try you can do is
when you sign up you get a free
consultation where the consulta online
on the website and they can teach you
how to use it what's best to use it with
and all those good things but something
that's really really cool that they give
you that extra little service as well so
so it's 750 per box you get 40 pounds
worth of products in it so it makes it
till it worth anyway obviously you'll
pay a little bit of postage and
packaging so if you imagine for 10 pound
a month you get a box full of like 40
pounds worth of products I'm pretty sold
I'm pretty sold with maybe oh yeah I'll
be honest with you I like it I like it a
lot so that's in my review what did you
think let me know in the comments if you
like this kind of video if you liked me
to start with you in one product it's
been a few times where I've wanted to do
this sort of thing I've never lived in
it before and not be sure if I should
but I thought this was quite a cool new
service and I thought that quite a few
of the people that follow me
are in the age bracket where they may
really interested in this like I am so I
just really want to show it to you and
see what you thought as well so that's
it really hope you enjoyed it if you did
please give me a thumbs up and subscribe
if you'd like to that'd be awesome
and hopefully I will see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
