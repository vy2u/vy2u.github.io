haul collection things have been loving
kind of video I just wanted to put
together something that shows you I've
been loving recently in terms of beauty
and also a few things I picked up so i
went to lush oh really excited to know i
have never really bought anything from
us before it's always been somewhere
that I've gone in a little bit
overwhelmed by the sense and then walked
out again without really bad anything
but I've seen so many lulz recently and
everything looks so nice and all the
times people have actually bought me
things for like bath times and whatnot
I've loved them so I thought well why
not just by myself a few so a few I did
behind in fact I think I bought eight
different things I can show you those
and a few things that I'm loving as well
I'll start with a feel of things I've
been loving and then move on to the lush
haul at the end first thing brand new
palette from Illamasqua this is a
multi-faceted palette in the shade aura
by the way my nails are all for this
video I'm really sorry does not have to
paint them but actually the nail
polishes in this so you'll see you in a
minute this is the orem palette Oh think
about this part that's so cool is that
it contains so many different powders
and shaved and products so you've got
cream highlighter you've got it blush a
high brow wax a contour shade and then
for eyeshadows as well so it's perfect
travel companion you can throw it in
your bag you get a couple of brushes
with it as well so it's easy to apply I
mean I would always recommend using your
she so in on this day but it's up to you
but the fact is you can add a blush
contour Tajiks he can have highlights
tough y'all to your cheekbones and then
it can add some of the brow wax onto
your brows I featured this on my blog
recently as well if less account for
some more pictures I'll even look at the
logo to that blog post but I starts
really with the pool at hadley pallets
got a little narrow as well next thing
I've been wearing daily in fact on it
any on today because I'm just got oh so
nice it's jo Malone would sage sea salt
Cologne yes is for women a lot of people
have been soft messaging me and saying
is this for women's it's Cologne it just
says cologne it is for women it's so so
pretty I mean what what can I smell it's
quite a woody scent kind of got that
sharpness and sort of sea salt in it and
then I hear be sent from the sage it's
just quite a woody fragrance really but
it's still got very light notes very
kind of crisp and very bright and
outdoorsy wild kind of smell like yeah
fragrances are so hard to talk about but
and me it's just best to go into store
and have a look out for this because
it's really really nice something I
tried yesterday actually for bed and it
kind of blew me away straightaway except
like this is so nice I get it now arises
meant to be so good this is the hand
cream from hand chemistry is extreme
hydration concentrate palette is an
ultra concentrated hydration that
contain five hydration active
technologies you can expect results
immediately in 24 hours out in 10 days
then you meant if you've got real even
the dress code on your hands for example
let's use this for 10 days morning and
night and you'll see massive improvement
well so something me the knife of us is
kind of like a fit gel it's quite odd
not really how to hack
it is like a thick gel goes over the
hands it's got such a lovely smell it's
really fresh and does kind of have that
smell that sort of makes you feel like
it's doing something really really good
now you just makes it hard to feel
amazing afterwards it's just like gel
coat is serum of view so really like
that and I think when I've been putting
it on every single night from now on
next thing it's a Eve long cleanser yes
i know this is quite pricey i think it's
in a kind of 42 round range but if
you're after something quite luxurious
and something does a sort of spice up
your cleansing routine this is wonderful
it's it's like a thick wax it's almost
like Vaseline in that kind of hard
setting but you just dip your fingers
then take a look at the product when you
work it together with in your hands it
sucks John's melt and then when you put
onto your face it kind of smelts into
the face it's river although for a
massage it all over it and it feels
wonderful he's a hot muslin cloth that
you get with it you get it in the pack
and really under hot water rinse it out
it's nice and driving still hot and then
use wife away and exfoliate all of it
away and the skin feel smooth and
beautiful and it gets are involved your
skin and yeah just feel amazing so I'm a
little loving this so much I've been
trying to use experiment because I don't
you have this job but what I do use it
it's cannon for those luxurious nights
and it's not to pamper next thing but
I'm loving for water especially is this
new leighton denny nail varnish this is
in the shade I'm so Hollywood I do have
it on one else now if I hadn't had a
very stressful week and baked them off I
do suffer from that habit of when I'm
having quite a stressful week I'll start
to pick up off on my nail polish I know
a lot of people that do
that it's really really bad habit so
about four nails Miriam did it now what
am i doing so I need to need to talk or
buts it's beautiful it's kind of a
cherry cherry red and instead of that
very litter box read that I've got a lot
of a line of fact this is more cherry so
it's a bit more autumnal and too many
reduce our business a lot over the
summer summer a lot over the ottomans
and the last thing that I've really
really like is this new Clarence I
palette it's called the essential
mineral and plant extracts talent and
makeup palette this would make such a
good present for christmas offres
birthday coming up it's really lovely
it's got 5 10 shades shade 10 shades
inside very neutral some mats some
shimmer ate the most incredible gold
shimmer now in the middle extremely
pigmented it will just add that amazing
glitter top coat to your eye makeup look
little mirror it's also got a gorgeous
little Clarence brushing it which unlike
mostly sets where I wouldn't ever
elusive brushes I would use these
because it look really really good so I
think for present someone order to treat
yourself in palette this is beautiful
until lush haul I'm no doing these
before like I said this is the first
time I've ever been to look should
actually spent a lot more knee in that
but everything just smell amazing when I
went in and they had to form sprite and
hit all the new Christmas see kind of
wintry scents and things in there so I
can quite a bit cray okay so let's do it
up starting off with Snow Fairy I've got
this it's a limited edition shower gel
most people know about this in their
lush fans it comes out every Christmas
apparently and it is just the most
amazing bubble gum pink glitter smell
smell of a little bit like Marks and
Spencers
13 eggs it's just heaven like years
define if you like Bingley sweet smells
and candy smells this is for you I think
this is about 795 for the spotlight to
shower gel but I was just sort of like
it can use the bath leave and she's like
yeah yeah of course he can't I don't see
why not so then he sits in the bath as
well now next thing I got the honest
little ass by the way was the candy
mountain ba ba three looks like this
little pink and white mountain it's kind
of a very kind of candy strawberry right
sent just like Snow Fairy really but
yeah it's just super super sweet that's
gonna be wonderful so that's a cool bar
the idea of this is that you just stop
crumble it underneath the water and
it'll start to bubble up the bath and
make it smell incredible fans going
start amazing after this video okay
execute is almost I can't remember what
I sure picked up stock white flowers
okay this one is this is the melting
marshmallow government I've had this one
before my flatmate report and it was
divine oh just smells like marshmallows
it's so pretty right so the idea with
this one is the luxury bath mount you
run yourselves a perfect temperature
bath getting and gently large this soft
mush with a pillow across the water and
wash it Bob and flavor way it does it
kind of just phones and stop Bob's on
the water it takes a while and it makes
it back sort of nice and very light pink
that I'm going it's right in fact I
might just stop saying
unattractive everything that you're
about to see are up there looking to
thwart it oh so pretty hey next thing
this is the magic wand before in a
little um hold has he actually see the
little pink star on a stick it's like a
look a little little bell the idea with
this one is that once the waters running
you kind of swish it around in the water
it sucked bubble up I meant loads of
bubbles in your water and then you can
take out so you can use is quite a few
times it's more to use so after you got
off enough bubbles you lied take out
leave to dry on the side and then pop it
back in the bag and then you got it for
a few more times and apparently might be
like four or five times you can use it
as you can see I like to go for the pink
ones because the pink one smells
sweetest I found very similar to
marshmallow marshmallow one google kicks
one this one is the luxury watch put
this is a backdrop so I'm sure we all
know what bat boxes throw it in the
water they blow the color and scent and
wonderfulness this one is a Christmassy
one so it's got a little tiny Holly from
the top but this been the luxury lush
porch I thought I'd be kind of Christmas
pudding scented maybe cinnamon maybe
ginger or something very christmasing
but it's not really it scumbags got more
of a robust to this gate fell in the
pink ones and the very kind of flash
fellow calculators but it's still bright
floral e
I can't really explain what it's so
cliche and the idea was over this is
just put it in the back but it bears
enjoy this is another bath bar this was
a father Christmas one else got wasn't
going to buy this at first and then when
I got to the character the only
helicopter silliman she's have you seen
the family as well this year they've
changed the scent this year it's much
nicer let it smells she said it smells a
bit like Snow Fairy so oh it does you
know it when you're in wash it's quite
difficult to smell everything because
there's so much scent you've already
sniffed 55 bath bombs you've got glitter
and you've got soap up your nostrils and
then you go strands multiple nuts into
smells like with fame you like well I
don't know should I get out as well but
now I've got it here that's so nice okay
that might be my favorite so far even
it's just sweet candy candy kind of
flavor it's got the cute little
Christmas food is good news here so get
that weather office at 50 ok next one I
got the Queenie candy bath bubble bath
slice somewhat like a little piece of
pink cake and it smells wonderful i get
if i mostly smells very similar sweet
candy so peace mouth so you crumble
about on for hot running tap to our
water to agitate mounds are bubbles for
you with no effort on your part is
another one
crumble into the bath milk bath really
creamy and pretty yeah and finally we've
got the comforter which I'm sure your
point no vow because it's just one of
the brightest things of ourselves look
at this so seriously I mean it's good
enough to eat just pull its strongest
sent out of them all but it's so pretty
today in the idea what this one is it's
a bubble bar slice good ball the bar and
a hot running again so I got a couple of
these on cou your bubble bars so you top
breaking onto the tap I've gotten really
bright so got a few of these little bars
you can break up until the tap will stop
follow-up limit but really really creamy
or she got the bath bombs you just throw
in the water and then explode or fears
all gone beautiful and I've also got the
mounting Marshall a moment as well it
just sort of melts away a bit creepy
lists but with e well let selection
there so expect a fast now I'm not
really a bad person I'll be honest but I
feel that I worked too hard recently I
don't have enough time with myself and I
just feel that maybe if I to start
having baths I'll put that time aside to
shut out of the bath put on an episode
of something on my laptop chill out then
maybe you'll help a little bit so I
thought these would encourage me to
stand back and relaxing that's
everything I'll leave all links down
below foolish everything I've talked
about some peace he got to go and buy
some also really hope you like this kind
of hole and it's kind of loving things
