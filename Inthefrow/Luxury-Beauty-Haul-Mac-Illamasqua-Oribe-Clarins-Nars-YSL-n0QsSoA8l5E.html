tutorials at the TMI tag I've done a few
other things and I realized I haven't
really done a whole in a while so I
thought because I've got so many clothes
and so many beauty products to show you
that I would do two holes one being
beauty one being fashion so this is the
beauty haul so I hope you enjoy it
starting off I'm going to do hair
products I've only got a couple of
things for hair so I'll do those first
treating myself to a brand new bottle of
the Moroccan oil light this is on off at
the moment I feel unique and I look
fantastic calm
it's that patent moment it's by far the
best hair aisle I've used it I can't
wash my hair and dry my hair without
using this anymore and then I also have
these from chiki chiki hair extensions
you've turned to two inch the remy hair
so this is see real natural hair I was
it's super soft it's in beautiful
condition seeing as it's not like a
really light blonde there is a blonde
version of this you can get a kind of
platinum version but the idea behind
this officer doesn't go into much my
hair I am going to take this to my salon
and I'm gonna get them to die at the
same color as my hair hopefully so that
I can have extensions in can of my like
hair loss so the people at Cheeka Cheeka
Cheeka recommended that I go for the
kind of light blonde one of the lightest
blonde because it might take a little
bit of the tone so I'm looking forward
to seeing how that works out and I can
show you then what happens but I just
like to show you these anyway because of
such beautiful condition if you're
looking for some hair extensions and
these are really really really good I
think these are about eighty pound I've
seen quite a few of the ave products
going around mainly the dry mist
texturizing spray a few others I don't
really see many people mention this one
but I picked up the wave and shine beach
spray just because I like that kind of
surf lock surf spray dry kind of surf
beach hair look I literally kind of get
my hair the way I want it to and if I
want the ends of my hair like here to be
super big and bouncy and let's use a
little bit of this and just kind of
spray it through the bottoms give it a
bit of a booth stop and it just kind of
antelope some volume and kind of
super-big and waving it but I'm really
really liking this so maybe if you want
to give it a go they're also the smaller
bottles that you can get instead I think
it's about 35 pound balls it is it's
quite pricey but if you're after really
good quality hair products and this is
nice one to give a go to two perfumes
that I've got recently first of all is
the tongue for black orchid if I've ever
smelt it on for cents you will know just
how strong they are they're absolutely
beautiful but they're does the strongest
perfumes I have ever smelled this this
is the female one the black orchid it's
beautiful it's a really deep this quiet
kind of masculine tone - I feel like
musky quite woody it's kind of got that
deep woody
scent to it but also this kind of
sweetness really rich sweetness almost
like parma violets no kind of pump deep
fat Pam Palmer violet somewhat mixed
with Cola bottles mixed with the Wadena
sand so I think this for this bottle
which is 50ml I think it's 60 pounds and
but the fact that you only have to use
such a small amount every time you use
it it means you can keep it for ages and
a perfume that I got for Christmas
actually is the extension molecules
molecule one you may have heard this
before
it's the unisex perfume it works with
your pheromones so it works different on
different people when you put it apply
it to your skin it works differently
with this kind of skin and temperature
be skin so every one smells slightly
different whether wearing it but I'm
pretty sure it's got some sort of
aphrodisiac in it or something it's kind
of so seductive to smell it is very
unisex it's not very sweet but it's not
very manly it's but it's also fresh and
it's just got this kind of very
distinctive scent to it that is just
beautiful and again we self wear it you
can really smell it coming off you and
it's just absolutely beautiful so again
that is something to really check out I
think they sell it at Harvey Nicks and
at liberty and they might also sell it
on cult beauty now I think okay I want
to make up bits watch life start with
let's start with Mack mr. Mack products
that I am absolutely loving something
that I have to get because so many
people recommended it
the Mack Russian red lipstick it is
almost a perfect kind of cherry deep red
and quite sort of mapped on the lips so
works beautifully with the cherry lip
liner which is another one of my sort of
favorites at the moment it's something
I've picked out recently I'm super easy
to apply you can apply this like a
lipstick quite often I apply it and lip
liner and fill of my entire lips and
leave it like that if you want to stop
girl the top it's perfect
to add a Russian meadow of the top it's
just a perfect perfect red color so as I
said so I've got the Mac cherry lip
liner but also I adore the night mouth
lip liner and these two together are
perfect for creating the kind of ombre
lip so I've been lining my lips and
almost filling them in with the sherry
lip liner so I'm going around the sides
with a night mouth around the very edges
of my lips filling those in and then
stop going over again with cherry and
kind of mix it perfectly so it creates
the ombre going from dark to light
carrying on with the red theme new brand
new set that you may seen that's out
from Illamasqua it's got four items
inside one of them being this beautiful
red again I'm just thinking 14 Reds at
mo but this is called maneater and again
very kind of similar to Mac Russian red
very very similar max where she made a
slightly more cherry and this was
slightly more red and again the
Illamasqua ones have got more of a sort
of chalky finish to them and then Mac
but this came such a beautiful set and
it came with the red lip liner to go
perfectly with it and it also came with
this beautiful red nail varnish which is
in throughout but it also came with a
stunning red lip gloss as well which is
just the most incredible pigmented right
I'm finish lip gloss it's beautiful it's
like
Hollywood lips beautiful so there came
as a set of four which acts like
gorgeous and I think this set is 50
I think it's 50 pound moment reduced
from 59 so if you get it soon it'll be
perfect kind of thing for Valentine's
Day is like you're kind of gonna go with
a bit of a red theme for Valentine's Day
I'm gonna continue with you on my scare
because it's one of my favorite brands
actually a special at the moment and
this lipstick which I'm wearing now I
absolutely adore I don't know why I
haven't bit this up before because I
love pink lips baby pink lips account of
my thing especially especially where the
last year or so I mean I've really
gotten to talk dark reds and purples
recently as you might know but I always
go back to pink the nude and this is the
most beautiful baby pink coral lip ever
this is called Fable again as all
illamasqua lipsticks are it's kind of
quite a chalky finish and quite matte
but all I do is that just a little bit
of another sort of a nude satin lipstick
over top very just not even tried the
color just had a bit of a sheen or I
will add this over the top of Carmack's
and it almost creates a bit more obvious
soft satin finish what the color is just
perfection I absolutely adore it and
that highly recommended and again the
masker is this set that I've used every
single day now since I got it this is
the sculpting powder jus it's got the
bronzing contour section and also the
highlighter both look used to fit
together they're not too orangey they
are so pigment is that you can just
apply a little bit on to a brush and
work it into contours another brush to
do highlight and you cheeks are done
within about two minutes they're just so
good okay I can't recommend them any
more because I absolutely adore this um
I don't know if you know before but I
absolutely adore the androgen pigment
and in fact if you love the androgen
pigment which I know a lot of people do
fable
I think fable is literally the androgen
pigment
lipstick if you apply under chin pigment
as a lipstick can I have to do fable is
literally that in a lipstick so if
you're after some that sort of at ease
of them using your finger and a part and
plants your lips by fable because it's
just exactly the same I think but in
terms of pigments I also picked up holo
I've been really intrigued about this
for quite a while because I thought
maybe I'd be an awesome cream contour
isn't kind of the tanned bronzy look
that you would get from the Illamasqua
sculpting powder duo it's not kind of a
tanned contour instead it's almost like
a gray gray tone brown but I apply it
with the Real Techniques foundation
brush a really small brush and almost to
map out my face and then I'll go back
with my contour brush and work on the
skin and blend it perfectly or I litter
to start with contour brush get onto the
brush and I'm just work it in myself and
it's beautiful it is so good at creating
a perfect contour it apply perfectly to
the areas that you need it to and it
gives such a beautiful color and toe so
that's highly recommend if you're after
a cream contour shade the next thing
when I show you that's the door is one
of the wire cell Rouge Velata lipsticks
and I bought it in number one which is a
nude beige shade and it's just so
beautiful such a beautiful nude and with
lots of pinky tones obviously it's quite
sheer this is perfect I have to apply so
the top of the Illamasqua Fable just a
little bit it just sounds a bit more of
a kind of Sheen and makes it sort of
more satin I have recently repurchased
the NARS sheer glow so Real Techniques
expert face brush apply matte this to it
work it over the face and it is
wonderful I use a shade Deauville which
is probably too light for me now because
I had tan a lot now I mentioned this
before but I got so sick of feeling so
pale that I just started to sort of
apply a bit of town round again so it
means that my face is a little bit
darker than Deauville which I sort of
had last winter when I was not in the
tanning phase
however I have been using my Laura
Mercier SIL cream foundation which you
might seem I love to mixing the two
together to get the kind of perfect
shade for me quite lightweight but you
can build it up beautiful it is such a
beautiful kind of dewy finish and I
absolutely love this it's about 32 pound
I thought I would mention this as well I
got this recently this is a solar power
powder from soap &amp;amp; Glory and it is again
it's kind of a bronzing highlighting duo
but because the highlighter isn't too
light I have let you been using the Real
Techniques powder brush living it
through this applying all over my face
working it into the contours and it
leaves most beautiful color such a
beautiful tone brown it's not orangey
and it's great for left into the
contours and just give me a bit of sort
of a more of a glowing face so that
highly recommend and I think this might
be around 12 to 15 pounds and also comes
with a brush in the back I haven't
actually use it because I like my own
brushes but that's super handy if you've
got this on the go so you've got
highlighter an advance or if you need it
and I'm gonna finish off with some
products from Clarins throughout their
new spring collection so many beautiful
new things I shadows blushes lip glosses
and illuminating face bases so I'm going
to show the things I love the most from
the collection starting with this which
is the multi blush cream blush in number
one peach such cute little blushes and
this gorgeous little packages got a
little mirror inside and it's a cream
blush but it's just a really pretty
color of peach and they're really really
pretty I think they're about 24 pounds
each I also really like this which is
the ombre mineral for colors i quartet
in vibrant light this comes with two
little brushes as well to apply but it's
a cute little palette it's got a
glittery silver a baby lion look
a glittery kind of purple and a almost a
gray green so many different kind of
color combinations with this on the lids
go with the grays and Silver's I should
go with the purples on a little bit
silver too and the inner corners just
really make them pop and or you could do
a mixture of kind of it's a purple mix
with the greens it would look beautiful
and the brush here's a super handy you
need those as well it's got a really big
mirror but I mean the Clarins eyeshadows
you can't really go wrong they're always
absolutely stunning so I love that some
things that is in their existing
collection it's not nice bring
collection but some that are picked at
recently and this is a blush Emmylou
mating cheek color in number 3 Miami
pink and I just had to get this because
it's just so beautiful and I love my
pink blushes boy it's just so pretty I
mean how pretty is the packaging and
then come to this little brush if you
mean dear and we can see that and but
it's so beautiful it's got a mixture
self a deep pink and a light glittery
kind of pink so when you start sweet to
arm this is such a beautiful kind of
flush to the cheeks and that's
everything and I try to make that as
fast as possible because I've seen so
many different products that I've picked
at recently as always you can follow me
on instagram and twitter at in the fro
and on my blog in the fro comm where i
will probably be mentioning all these
