doing very very well this is going to be
a new type of video I have never done an
unboxing before when it comes to premium
and luxury pieces you guys know that I
love to film fashion holes and I figured
it was about time that maybe I started
mixing it up and incorporating a lot
more luxury premium pieces into the
holes especially for anyone that really
loves premium or is thinking of
investing images for those that love to
look at Chanel or do or any of those
kind of luxury brands and just want to
kind of get insight into what they could
potentially save up for and buy in the
future I went and did a bit of holes
with the day in London and so many of
you on my snap from my snapchat and from
my Twitter said please halt what you
bought so this is for you guys I guess
if you're not someone that likes premium
fashion you don't like designer it's not
something you would particularly by then
this probably isn't the video for you so
I'd probably recommend clicking away now
let's continue okay
first piece and going to unbox is a pair
I bought from Dior sorry lady wearing
these in Paris when I went to the victim
off with your show and I'd seen them
already magazines I think or online and
as soon as I saw her in them I kind of
straightaway confirmed that maybe I
needed these boots with all the wrapping
simple white your bucks these are the
Dior Trianon with a ten-centimeter heel
in moi marine side the box we have your
just bag your render patience okay and
this open stop for the boot this is now
these aren't going to be to everyone's
taste
they are quite unusual quite different
and they're very soft your s foots but I
absolutely adored them and you're at the
moment is a brand that I'm just truly in
love with and here
ha so these boots it's almost like a
jacquard fabric that goes up into the
tall ankle boot in a navy and black in a
floral print at the toe and the tip of
the heel is almost a dark pink dusky
rose and white the heel is an almost
like a dark brown fabric with a copper
woven floral design and then the inside
is laced up to the top but you can get
into it by the zip which again is in the
same color as a tip of the boot shape I
just think is absolutely incredible the
fact it's so sort of flat here into this
amazing point the actual sort of curve
is so like slender and really sexy and
then extremely straight heel and then
the way the heel sweeps in it's just
very sexy it's almost very kind of
feminine shaped I was thought they're
absolutely amazing boots why I wear a
lot of jeans and the use of the kind of
boots I could have thrown with the pair
of jeans a top like this and it would
have had that kind of statement factor
to it straight away I can throw on a
designer bag or even a normal bag and it
will just be about the boots and that's
why I really wanted them exist in a
statement they're so different they're
completely unique
these are 700-pound if you don't like
the pink and the bronze they also do
pretty much the same boot to put all
just in the black in the black and blue
so it's without the pink tip in the
bronze heel but as we love that so
they're the same price 700-pound pretty
much for the Trianon dior boot last but
not least I went to Chanel I own one
pair up Chanel espadrilles so far from
Chanel although I have a few friends
that have Chanel shoes now we're always
so jealous because he always looks so
beautiful feminine and classic so I went
on to Chanel's a day and ended up
leaving with two pairs but the reason
being that I thought if I don't buy them
now chances are I'll come back next
month to buy another pair and it will
still go first up these are the beige
and black sandals that tied up
with a bow inside its H now just back
inside the box are shoes I don't believe
is the classic and I'll be able to wear
these for date nights and really special
occasions and this is pair of heels they
really are like super classic throwing
one's quite vintage Chanel style with
the beige and the black on top of the
black almost patent black leather are
the two Chanel sees and ride it on the
inside - screams Chanel it also says
Chanel just hit on the gold buckle as
well but I thought they were just so
extremely classic thought that with a
pair of sort of black skinny jeans or
leather trousers even just black tights
and I keep little black dress or
anything these will just look so sweet
I love them straight away tight low at
first sight in my friend Steph was like
you have to get those are so beautiful
these were 495 pounds which is the kind
of general price I usually pay for heels
from by jean beatty russy's or
Louboutins are quite often around the
495 mark and the flowing or pair the
short boots in black doesn't really give
me any more idea of the names and that
actually well hopes I'll find out for
you again like just bare it just inside
okay and here is the fourth pair these
are a pair of peep toe boots which if
you know me well you'll know this is a
kind of boot that I wear daily daily
kind of boots it's in a signature Chanel
quilted patterning hatin leather toe
bounding and then the back of the heel
is Ana patents of plasticky material I'm
guessing and it has this cutout section
with a little pearl and on the Pearl are
two seas they open up just with a little
zip down the side these will be
especially now coming into spring and
summer with little peep toe but I think
I'd be able to wear these all year round
and it doesn't get that cold here I
thought I'll get so
much we're out of these and I'm
absolutely in love with them that's it
for this premium whole shoe unboxing
video really really hope you enjoy it
