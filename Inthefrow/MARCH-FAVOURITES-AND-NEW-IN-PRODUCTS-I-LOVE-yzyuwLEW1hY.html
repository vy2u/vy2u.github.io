March favorites as I do every single
month going through all the favorite
things I use this month and in fact this
times a lot of new things I like to go
through new and products that I've
either the scent or I've brought myself
to review and things I'm not quite
started using properly but I'm pretty
darn excited to get them into my
routines so let's just pick this up like
I said a lot of new instinct here that
really excited about and only a few
things I'm super like obsessed with in
terms of using all the time now usually
I like start off these favorites
recently with putting all the products
onto my face so you can see them but
then I realize that and none of the
products that I'm going to be talked
about I've in fact all the products I
used in my last video in my hangover
makeup routine video so I thought
instead of showing you again is actually
what I was doing I would just sort of
point you over there so if you like the
look of any of these products I apply
them all sort of in detail in that video
I'll leave a card on the screen so you
can go and view that but I thought I'd
still talk through them and why I'm so
so in love with them first being this
Chanel foundation the sub Lamar's left
aunt Pru Chanel and especially when it's
used in conjunction with this brush
which is a foundation powder brush
number seven from Chanel I recently went
away with Chanel on a press trip from a
brand new Rouge Coco gloss lip lacquers
which are actually beautiful such
gorgeous pigmented glasses
well we got to visit this beautiful
Chanel makeup store in Paris and it gave
me the chance to look around all of the
different makeup and potentially I
haven't seen before and that's where I
spotted this and I tried it out love the
consistency and I managed to get my
hands on some for myself and this is in
20 beige and using this at the moment
and mixing it with some lighter
foundation because it is quite dark I
can use this formula with more talents
but I'm a few days old in terms of town
right now another thing I love about it
first of all packaging I think is
absolutely beautiful and it's like it's
like a little herb but it's just such a
beautiful consistency it goes on it
almost just enhances my skin I am still
feel like my skin looks like skin
underneath which really Chloe is really
in Radian not too jewy or orally or
anything like that we just feels radians
okay have fun be careful they're going
over there love you Munem illegal we
just give that a really beautiful
radiant complexion I love using it with
this brush because the way this duo
fiber works is that it just disperses a
product without packing it on without
caking it very lightly feathers it onto
the face I feel so it doesn't add too
much product and I actually couldn't
recommend it more I'm really really
loving this a lot but again I think you
can see me using that in that video
next up the NAR sofmap complete
concealer this is in the shade canal
light to some five and it's actually so
fantastic to use it's very creamy but
also quite light with a really great
medium coverage and usually the formula
to dab it in and then dab onto my face
and it's literally the perfect amount of
product is being applied in also so on
it can see us everything I want with so
much ease it's just so easy to use
honestly so brilliant I can't recommend
it enough the size of this as well and
portability I throw it now into my bag
wherever I go and I know it's safe sort
of seemed to top anything up and I know
it's going to do the job so perfectly
obviously can't recognize more I think
it's absolutely wonderful
bro my favorite thing in this whole
video is going to put this product which
is the Tom Ford shade and illuminate
intensity one I'm kind of very where I'm
mentioning all these products again well
I have to learn this it's such a massive
favorite I recently discovered it I
think it's incredible I've used it today
as my cheek contour and highlight as
well as on my eyelids which again you'll
see in that videos back same way that I
used it and I find the consistency is
the most beautiful Julie radiant and
illuminating cream
it's very used to use I put off using
this for a long time I had it my George
and use it for a long time so a little
bit intimidated and so that I finally
did I think it's just so creamy in doing
it's exactly what I want right now for
my
makeup mascara again my lashes have
never looked so good recently and it's
down to two different mascaras one being
the Clarence wasp roof which I can't
talk about anymore because I've talked
about too much and then this one which
is surrounding with your show pumpkin
for you it has this squeezable tube so
that when you pull it out you can
squeeze the tube and it puts even more
product onto your brush which enables
this brush to give you the very second
very volumize lashes it's all about
plumping up the lashes so they're very
volume eyes they're very thick it almost
brought it on clumpy if you apply a few
coats of this you'll get that very thick
lumpy lash look but you know a lot of
people love we're just one coat as this
I applied it just now and it just really
helps thicken and volume eyes and for me
my lash is almost like a little bit
false I'm really really really happy
with this right now I think I may
mention in my last video what CD or
addict lip lacquers are my favorite lip
kind of products right now this is in
the shade Bella and I want to show you
this is how much of music that's it
it's got it got completely gone I don't
run last time I use a lipstick until it
was finished
that's how much I loved it if you happen
to see this do your Bella and any saw
please please tweet me because I cannot
find this one shade anywhere everywhere
shade is online you can buy them
everywhere but bel-air is nowhere to be
seen apart from maybe Selfridges but I
think it's filled out so please try and
find this Bubba guide and if not you
need to try itself the pigmentation beef
is so wonderful they're creamy they're
hydrating they literally are so
pigmented you can throw on there and
then the color of the top when the other
color will take the place of the other
chordoma that they are that pigmented
and I'll following up my word from so
excited about this whole product it's
wonderful I can't love this more also
big shout out to Rimmel lip pencil which
is become my one and only it's in
cappuccino and it's that perfect nude a
bit shadowed a bit a she toned also I am
going to stocking up on these bad boys
they are my secret weapon right now so
brushes I have to mention are the new
real technique
Rush's these have a name what are they
Mac like tech brushes first of all they
are so super deep soft third it's up so
it wonderfully made they're gorgeous was
packaged I mean I never knew I need a
such a big brush until I got this and I
forgot my garden so I think but this one
specially is like a little Chevron's or
brush it's a gorgeous very super soft
and it's absolutely beautiful but I have
messed with and loving this one actually
which is in a set and it's a point
excess it's just a really lovely brush
to pack on eyeshadow of your lids as
Weis to get those dimension consider
really beautiful another project I have
to mention is the pixie double cleanse
by Caroline herons she created this with
pixie and it honestly magical Caroline
knows her skin care and she knew what
she wanted in a product and this was it
and I completely get it double cleanse
with a solid cleansing oil on one side
and a cleansing cream on the other so
it's a wonderfully packaged perfect you
can't answers cruise so bright in here
so I've been taking this with me on
every single traveling trip I've been
doing recently because after I've taken
off my eye makeup I'll go in with this
harder oil you know it's like very soft
touch lab it's you know what I mean this
softer soil texture and it just works
over all of your makeup and breaks it
down and you can wash that off and then
you can go in with the creamy assigned
cleanser and again it just takes off
everything else while conditioning and
hydrating the face and removing every
last little bit of makeup that you may
have on there and you have to say it's a
fantastic product that is very much
worth by okay
let's move in to kind of new in and
other things like that the pair of jeans
on it to mention because Hudson are one
of my favorite jeans brands and these
are a new pair from them these are the
Suzy super skinny and I love this detail
on the knees this is patch in slightly
darker shade in fact it's almost as if
it's been cut from here in this patch
then the cuffs of each leg up in this
darker shade and a bit sort of cut up
frayed at the edges but I am so excited
to wear these so much more and that's
obsessive fit is wonderful and then kind
of saving these for a holder that I have
coming up I've had these nails a few
weeks and I keep looking at them I'm
thinking I want to wear them still the
first time you
a pair of jeans and they fit my
perception and they look their best
I want that to happen when I'm on
holiday so I'm saving them but I wanted
to mention them because Hudson is a
favorite jeans friend of mine and their
new collection including these up on
fire I love them okay these boots guys I
need your opinion on them I think
they're amazing but I want your opinion
please boots now they don't have a heel
so caesarian like me but the whole
combat boots chunky more masculine boots
trend is kind of everywhere and I see so
many people kind of rocking it and I'm
all like there I just like my nice
little pointy heels I'm not really ever
into this kind of style
those are these on the Louisa Biron
website and just Otis after them I
thought they were really chic really
cool but also quite grungy quite
masculine very kind of rub chick very
just very very cool and I thought can
you pull this off I want to get your
advice on this what do you think of
these do you like them I'm a little bit
obsessed to them I think they're very
very cool so let me know as we talk for
few more new in products to mention
first of all the new flower bomb bloom
by the corrals you probably know if
you've been here for long time a flower
bomb is probably my favorite scent to 12
on extreme the darker shade is the scent
I have worn for the past five 10 years
I'm absolutely love with it and it just
brought out bloom which is I think the
underlying notes of this are pomegranate
so something very fresh but also more
fruity floral about this sense it still
have the floral notes that you'll
recognize but that fruitiness of the
pomegranate just adds up something else
I think that what this really reminds
masks which remember is guard of
perfumes from back in the day this guard
a perfumes this one called rocking Rio I
was in love they're so bright and
richness fruity notes and I adored it as
soon as I smelled this and the
pomegranate I was like oh my gosh I
needed it honestly it's so beautiful go
try it and totally love for any flower
bomb fans we've got a new favorite I am
sure a few skin Kabat and very excites
try actually today I went for a skin
consultation and also I had a victim see
an ahj resurfacing peel with bee sting
clinic so this is just in the LA
bone area I went in there because I had
some problems recent with blemishes
which you might notice is fine here and
I also have Amelia underneath my eyes
and I wanted some advice and disc
consultation I went in there had this
appeal and I absolutely loved the young
pair who works at I think she was
wonderful which is just so many types of
treatments she's a real expert she's got
15 years expertise in this whole field
but she also has her own Ranger which is
just be skin care so to recommend Lots
approach for me I have a five step
regime that cleans a cleanser and I've
seen a peptide eye serum firming serum
cleanser and also moisturizer it's like
a full five step routine the Morgans
scientifically led them the high street
cosmetic runs you'll find for example
and I'm pretty sure it's of serum the
psych a vitamin C serum that she does
that has like 20% vitamin C in it which
is very different to on our high streets
where usually half right not quite one
percent to one percent a tendency to
Ta'ala is now a so like mind blown and
she's like that's why I can get
scientifically created products like
these and they work so much but an
actual do create differences in their
skin so I'm very excited I will report
that great all this goes I'm going
seeing her again soon and having more
treatments done with her she's going to
use this cryo pen on me which like
freezes little bumps and lumps on the
face and blemishes and removes
everything hopefully really excited
about it so I'll let you know how it
goes I thought I'd mention it so I'm
very excited about these and I'll always
be doing like a blog post on them and
all that so I'll report back
another thing I really wanted to mention
as something I haven't yet burned and
therefore I haven't quite used yet but I
have another one of these candles these
are Joel loves candles so they're
created by the wonderful Jill Malone and
she started her new brand called Co love
and the amount of products in there that
are absolutely beautiful I can't even
tell you since in their range are
wonderful but anyway this candle I love
the concept of the camera's coffee shop
candle and the idea is they have about
eight different fragrances and then
another eight and the idea is that you
pick one which is the base layer of the
candle and then you pick another one
which sits in
someone's got the bottom one has hole in
it the top one has kind of asking
elongated area and they fit together so
we kind of sit together in here I can
plug together and you can choose two
different scents so that when we burn
they start to melt and you create this
very customized for fun scent I love
this concept so for me what tonight what
I choose I have chosen a very woody kind
of smoky fire sent to the bottom and the
top one is salted caramel so when they
burn together it's going to be the best
thing ever
I'll be honest I'm not burned yet
because I'm almost too scared to burn it
because I'm really excited to start this
candle plus I have another candle like I
said not in new sense but another deal
of camera which I'm currently getting
through and loving it's absolute
beautiful aromas from it it's a stunning
candle but this is the one I'm very very
very excited about social convention a
newbie from Clarins they always bring
out an incredible bronzer for the summer
and this is that the bronzer and blush
compact look at this guys for different
layers we get slightly dark to go up and
then is a more shimmery orange II coral
tone to the bottom so a very bronze
orange look which I am loving right now
not the orange look but a bit more that
very burnt orange wrong I don't know
it's just very warm smell of it I think
the packaging is gorgeous got a mirror
parents always get it right for the
summer can't wait to use that do you
know I'm kind of realizing everything
I'm talking about it's very summer
bronzy shimmery but fill it up summer
coming up services coming out right now
then we have two new products from the
Armani cruise collection hello I saw
these products last season when I went
to Fashion Week with Armani and I saw
these and like when can tell are these
coming out because look at these oh my
goodness I can't tell you how beautiful
these are
oh my god it's such a warm bronze like
coppers and shimmers it's a beautiful
bronze and compact
bronzing and highlighting face palette
and it comes with a little brush as well
inside there and a mirror and then this
one is up see the sunset cruise smokey
eye palette so the idea with this get
two little brushes
yeah and these are my eye shadows he got
gold creams and also sterling green
which I'm all about right now like very
dark green blues on the lid a little bit
but those two is a little set of like a
bronzer and then with your eyes yes
Armani hell yes so good one more thing
is obviously this jacket I'm wearing
which is a brand new Bauman blazer I
thought I would get a brand new one for
the spring/summer this year I love that
black one but I started trying on back
on again I felt it felt a little bit too
big on me for some reason so I just slow
it down a little bit as well compensates
for in this I'm using cs6 just so you
know and also I only have a very small
chest size
well this is a sign Smith thought into
the new loop and we went down below and
but I'm very very excited about Wayne a
sort of spring/summer and I'll be blog
post pictures and all that jazz so busy
anyway this went on much longer than I
hoped for guys I'm very sorry I hope you
enjoyed it there's a lot here to get
through lots of very exciting new and
things and a few things I've been
obsessed with so I hope you enjoyed it
