video this is a really exciting one for
me I reached 90 thousand YouTube
subscribers I'm just absolutely over the
moon it's incredible from the time I
started YouTube to now it's amazing
heaven if you have joined me along the
way and whether you start following Alec
within a hundred subscribers or whether
you follow yesterday thank you so much
for being subscriber it's literally
incredible and it means the world to me
that you would subscribe so as a bit of
a thank you and there's an exciting
thing to do for 90,000 subscribers I
thought I'd do a huge giveaway so
everything about the giveaway you can
find at the end of the video so make
sure you stick along for that but for
the rest of the video I'm going to be
showing you a recent beauty haul I was
running out of loads of products loads
products that I use daily and absolutely
adore and I'll turn him out so I went
online to feel unique calm because I
found it's one the easiest ways to buy
all of the best brands at the best
prices so went online today I filled my
bag accidentally stumbled upon a few of
the products that I've not used before I
really wanted to use they got put in for
bag it arrived today so I thought I'd do
but the beauty haul is show you what I
picked up and see what you thought
really so I've got quite a few products
to show you ok let's start with haircare
so first up I bought the availa
damage remedy range shampoo and
conditioner you may have seen on my blog
or you may have seen it other favorites
videos I'm pretty sure or I feature
these in favorite videos before but
these are my favorite shampoo and
conditioner oh well one of them anyway
if you have colored hair or bleached
hair or if you use a lot of hair styling
products and use leave a little bit of a
boost every time you wash it these are
fantastic they're restructuring products
so this is a restructuring of shampoo
that helps repair strengthen and the
same with the conditioner they are so
wonderful to apply I find after a few
sees in the shower my hair
feels silky soft super lightweight it
drives beautifully and it just gives me
the perfect finish so I got two more of
these stinking with hair care I also
wanted to top up on the t-shi range this
is the well it's called the
reconstruction collection you can go for
thingy my lackeys reconstructive
products but these are in the headshot
range so it's a reconstructive intense
conditioner and the reconstructive
shampoo these again alongside the evade
products are one of my favorite brands
for hair care I would say I have three
favorite Cielo favorite would be Paul
Mitchell super strong conditioner
shampoo but I didn't need to repurchase
that because I've got huge bottles
already but I'm still trying to get
through so I did need a new version
thief so I got myself the super-sized
version in a two pack because you find
that that large you go with products
thing more the better value yeah so I
got these in a set the larger version so
these will last me for ages again
exactly likely of a deranged these
really clean your hair get that really
good cleanse help to strengthen it they
help to give it more life and body back
into the hair and I just find the
fantastic the dull strip color either so
the perfect using my purple and the
despont acid products let's move into
the skincare bits that picked up so this
thing is the Vichy waterproof eye makeup
remover could read that French then the
words with Anika remover I found this to
be one of the best I've tried I've tried
quite a few and I was really really like
this one it takes it's very similar to
the Clarins instant eye makeup movement
if you tried that one it's the one that
splits into the same way that this does
give it a bit of a shake-up so it has
liquids and oils inside it breaks down I
makeup
definitely it takes where you waterproof
mascara and it does the job better than
most of the products so I had to get
another one of these this is a product I
have never tried before but I've seen so
many other beauty bloggers and youtubers
talking about the search and range and
if so let's not feel unique and I
thought I would give it a go so this is
the ultimate cleanse and it's meant to
be one of the cool products so bottle
and it's just a really luxury cleansing
product so like a lot of cleanses this
will take off all of you makeup even I
makeup it just on clog the pores it
really lines up the face or this is what
everyone's tell me anyway
I'll be able to give you a review of
this sooner my blog but it's meant to be
one the best out there it's not the
cheapest of products ever but it does
something so fantastic I have to give it
a go so all you do with this it's just
massage a little bit over the face at
the end of the day and then it will
start to break down our view makeup and
all your eye makeup and then you can
just wash it off with your hands or some
water or if you've got any cleansing
cloths you can use those to really buff
away and exfoliate to the same time you
get everything on your face and it's
just meant to be fantastic so I'm super
excited about trying this out the next
thing I picked up was the Elizabeth
Arden skin balancing skin balancing skin
balancing Elizabeth Arden skin balancing
lotion that is a mouthful I've had
little testers in the past and they've
been fantastic and I've been so good to
do when I've run out of there because
I've said this isn't the cheapest of
products again it's from the 30 pound
range but it's so lovely on the skin I
love this to apply underneath my makeup
you just really refreshes her face it's
quite creamy but it has a little bit of
a gel consistency so it's really quite
serum like when you apply it so I
thought I'd go for the full size and
just have it through much much longer
kind of in the skincare body can of
range if this it's the brand-new escala
born in paradise
perfume if anyone else obsessed with the
scouter perfume
I have loved these since I was much
younger I still adore the sense if
nothing taking advantage so sorry floral
fruity bright vibrant they just
fantastic little tropical sense in a
bottle if you don't try to scatter you
really need to go and look because first
of all the bottles are so cute they're
always in there's really bright vibrant
colors we just look like something out
of like Hawaii and this one it's just
beautiful it's literally a tropical
scent in a bottle they're absolutely
amazing I think I've had every single
bottle in the Escada range of these
there are other rescaled perfumes as
well but these scarda ones are really
bright colored with it's really cool
cartoony boxes those are the ones I've
always collected but I treat myself and
get the 50 nails this is a 50 ml bottle
I thought I'd get that get that go and
it's absolutely fun it's so bright and
tropical is so pretty
okay I'm super excited this is the
makeup that I got okay
let's start small first thing I got was
this nail polish this is from butter
LONDON
and it's in the shade tough it's a topi
móvil purple shade and started be lovely
for winter and you're more often on
outfits it's not a really vibrant purple
but it's much more of a it's kind of a
purple mix with Browns Toby shades so
it's much more mature and much more
grown-up for just wearing bright purple
on the nails and all those look really
really lovely for winter so I went with
one of those and these are really really
good nail polishes as well I also got
myself a Tanya burr lip gloss this is in
the shade
champagne champagne toast and I thought
it'd look really pretty peachy nude with
a bit of glitter kind of shimmer in it
so I thought this would go over pretty
much any lipstick that you could
possibly find and would look lovely yeah
I'm excited to use this on the lines of
lipsticks I got Y from YSL I'm sure you
all know these the Rouge Philip shine
lipsticks are coming the most beautiful
packaging ever pick in Paris I'm wearing
it now show you when I first saw it's
quite dark when I put on it was such a
beautiful color pink perfect I just love
the consistency of these of quite a
sheer farm with great color payoff
though and it's really moisturizing the
last four hours but give a different
shade ago and this is a pink in Paris
okay next thing The Naked palette this
is the very first Naked palette I have
naked tear knife Naked 3 now and then I
have the Naked basics palette but I
don't have naked one it's the original
and some people think it's the best one
it's got this really pretty velvety
fabric to the box and when you open it
it has 12 beautiful neutral natural
shades I bought this for my mom for
Christmas and she absolutely adores it
and every single one of my friends
houses palette and I thought I have to
have it I went for this one I have it on
now I have virgin in the inner corners
of my eyes I have sinned
over the top and then I put naked which
is really pretty light brown shade just
into the crease so it's a really natural
eye it's gorgeous and it comes also with
the brush I'm not taking out the package
and it comes with the brush as well so
it's a fantastic kit and continuing with
the eye theme I also got a brand new
gimme brow for the benefit this is in
light medium I actually lost it I lost
it somewhere it's somewhere
I can't find it and I look absolutely
gutted when I lost it so I've got a new
one and I'm sure you've probably heard
about this it's becoming a real favorite
of most people it's just a finishing
brow brush but you can wear this alone
as well and it has some fantastic
results you just brush it over your
eyebrows it applies a little bit of
product Brown product Oh your eyebrows
pulls out the color and gives you
fantastic eyebrows within seconds it's
really really good so I had to get a new
one because I've got it wasn't in my
routine anymore next thing for blush
again that I'm wearing now if you can
see kind of highlighted a very light
pink I got this which is seed oh I love
she seed oh I think she pseudo was from
the first brothers I really splurged out
on when I became a blogger and when I
got really interested in makeup and
really expanding my collection to really
luxury fantastic products and there was
some shishito products and loved them so
when I saw this I couldn't not it was
too pretty
this is a face color enhancing trio it's
really pretty packaging
it's got a huge brush here which is
really soft and actually a really really
nice for a packaging brush the idea with
this is that beautiful beautiful baby
pink a white cream champagne and more of
a creamy lemony shade almost really
light colors and the three of them
together would have just you brush
through on the cheeks are stunning I put
all this morning looks literally like
wow I don't know if you can see it now
but it's so pretty I can't say I'm
pretty if it's just really light it can
apply it to Nancy cheeks and over your
cheekbones and it just adds a little bit
of product but the highlighting that is
beautiful absolutely beautiful so I
highly recommend it it's gorgeous
this was a big big haul as you can see
and I still have three products left
okay so starting with your skin's there
are foundation now I think this is
brand-new to the Dior range I've got it
in shade 22 which i think is the shade
cameo cameo now I've made a little
mistake with this I've got a little bit
too dark and a little bit too rosy I
should definitely have gone maybe for
the baby shades however the effect of
this is beautiful
it's really jewy it's illuminating I
mean as it says it's star so it does
have that kind of illumination to the
face it makes it beautifully jewy
without being overly oily it's not at
all oil and I don't feel like I've got
loads of foundation on at all it's
really lightweight its studio makeup as
well so it'll take pictures perfectly it
does have a range of shades I was just
filling that I picked from the website
and thought this sort of perfect for me
I should may have gone one lighter I
think but still really really pretty and
a gorgeous foundation actually highly
recommended the full coverage
professional finished fluid foundation
brush from door because why not
so it comes it comes in a little pouch
it's a flat top brush it's a sucker
buffing brush pretty much the flat top I
was getting the VR foundation so I
thought why not also get a brush as well
it's so cute it's perfect it's gonna be
perfect I can't wait to use it so I'm
gonna pop it back in its pouch and last
but certainly not least I also got the
deer show waterproof mascara I used to
have this years ago and absolutely loved
it but recently because I've been
throwing waterproof mascara
I didn't mean a girlfriend until I
realized that they had a waterproof
version the thing that's so cool about a
Dior show is it's got a huge brush on it
so it gets all of your lashes really
lengthens and separates all lashes are a
beautiful black finish and the best
thing about it is it to walk brief as
well so I thought you know what I'll
give it a go game see what I think of
the waterproof consistency and I really
really like actually I'm wearing it
again now right now as well most these
products I'm wearing now - the lipstick
the foundation of gimme brow the x-carve
