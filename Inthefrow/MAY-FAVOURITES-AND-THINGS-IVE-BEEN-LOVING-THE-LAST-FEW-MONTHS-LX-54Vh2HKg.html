new favorites video this is gonna be
about all the things I am loving loving
loving right now I haven't filmed a
favorite in so long because I've been
away way away anyway so I have literally
been thinking okay what should I like on
this trip what I love on this trip and
everything that I've been loving around
the house for the past few months
because it's been so long I mean I still
love watching these kind of videos
because I love seeing what people
actually using everyday from fashion to
beauty so hopefully you guys are still
loving them - I'd love to know just let
me know down below in the comments do
you still like these videos do you still
want me to carry on film innings because
I do really enjoy them I don't even know
where to start there are so many things
here because I have not spoken to you in
so long so I'm gonna try and go through
these in the most concise and precise
way I possibly can I'm gonna start off
with my skin first of all thank you to
everyone that's been so complimentary
about my skin although I just have had a
little breakout on my chair and I'm
hoping it's gonna die tomorrow but
usually the rest of my skin has been the
best it's ever being and a lot of you
are asking me to talk about it and I
want to do a really precise blog post
soon about all the products and talks or
everything probably but I'm just gonna
kind of give one little shout out first
of all to this this is a brand new man
using a lumia MD and this is the
recovery balm it's a very soothing
calming moisturizer I use this day night
use it every single time that I wash my
face and get ready for the day off for
the evening
I put this on this is kind of created to
be used after you've had maybe treatment
if you've had a chemical peel or if
you've had any other type of facial and
you want something sorry it's the light
and if you want anything that's gonna
soothe the skin this is what's it's made
for but I just find this gives my face
the most soothing I don't know it this
just makes my skin feel wonderful every
time but it on it makes a great base for
makeup it really adds such a dewy glow
to the skin as well which I love it just
makes it look really kind of not shiny I
don't wanna say shiny just like if it's
really healthy and but yeah it's very
soothing it takes my redness it just
makes my skin feel amazing so I'm gonna
talk much more about Lumiere MD soon but
if you do want to kind of start off with
one product to see how you go this one I
highly recommend this little guy is the
Jo Malone dark amber and ginger Lily dry
body oil I'm trying to get into my
I'm trying to get into oils and this one
smells absolutely insane it's absolutely
beautiful that smell I mean I massively
love amber I also really love lilies and
also ginger I don't know if ginger is
also in this or it's just gingerly
either way all three things on this list
I'm a big fan of it's a very kind of
intense a bit cologne esque
kind of smell but it just makes her skin
feeling me think my skin drinks this up
whenever I put it on so I've been using
this at nights after I've been having my
showers and it's just super luxurious
and just smells awesome to smell stuff
so good for my hair you know a massive
red chem fan and they just brought this
one this is the OL soft
mega shampoo in this color and it smells
the smells like it smells a vanilla and
coconut e a little bit like Sun cream
that Hawaiian Tropic smell that you get
in some oil it smells like that but it's
for severely dry hair to get touchable
softness and I am loving it a lot to
open use the shampoo and the conditioner
and then I finish off is one of my usual
mega masks that I always use but it's
it's awesome I cannot fault the red Ken
shampoo and conditioners they are insane
okay this is Publio tacomas absolutely
no surprise but hey this is my favorite
so just allow me this for a second guys
okay feet elaborate two products that
are now my absolute holy grails
and i have literally not stopped telling
people about these products I gladly
start conversation that start with have
you tried the new and busy firm it's a
bit sad but I am literature I recommend
this to everyone cuz I think it's a life
changer the Vita Liberata and busy
firming toning water I've never used a
Tahlia water before this I didn't know
how they worked in complete honesty I
didn't try them I didn't dabble I didn't
bother this came into my life because
I'm the biggest fan of feet Allah
brighter if you guys know and this was
like their new product so try it out if
you've not already seen my insta video
which I know a lot of you guys saw so
many of you guys went out and bought it
I'm so happy I'm sure you're loving it
if you did buy and you loved it or if
you if you not too sure down below let
me know in the comments I'd love to know
your feedback on it but anyway it's a
white foam you can put this all over
your body
obviously you need to pay attention to
where you've put it because if you miss
out a shin or a thigh it's gonna be
white and the other part if you like
it's gonna be dark any hours later
obvious it bear that in mind just really
take your time when you're doing like
one leg one leg one leg I always do leg
from bad arms chest open to face than
face anyway this is amazing this does
not transfer on to your sheets I have
been using this and wearing white to bed
and white sheets no transfer
no tan in sight it is the other product
is the thing that I pretty much wear on
my face only these days I also have
consumed concealer on now as well and
our tiny bit defend it on my chin just
because this spot situation but
otherwise this is the only thing I've
been using the reader Liberata Beauty
blur is insane it's the skin tone
optimizer have I talked about I've
talked about it a lot already guys I'm
really sorry but it's just priming
moisturizing illuminating bronzing base
but I use it as a foundation and it's
literally insane your skin glows a leg
at the Sun I think it's so I'm literally
amazing I'm nil at the end of this one
thank goodness re to have a second one
in my jaw and I'm gonna be stocking up
some more beauty products of major note
a hyper real glow from Mac is a
game-changer now look at that shiny like
the Sun let me just show you a quick
like 1 2 3 whoa whoa whoa Oh get it in
the right place Vicky seriously look at
that the pigments are literally beyond
the literally stunning I am I can have
coated my entire face in it today excels
in that kind of mood oh I just wanted
something uplifting on my face so I've
put a lot on now got too much I also
have it here as in a corner highlight so
it's my brand-new inner corner highlight
I'm in love with it that is insane I
wore this in the center and I did some
minister stories and I literally like a
glowy princess and you would not believe
how many incidence I got that were like
what is this so I started talking about
it it's not it's insane
this little eyeshadow palette if note
this is just a really beautiful palette
it just works really well it's got
really pretty smell going on there big
mirror and some gorgeous pigments like
this copper tone these two here are
absolutely beautiful it's a white as a
shimmery champagne there's a perfect
like cool tone crease color and then
you've got a darker shim
and then to even darker colors here just
to mix up that very neutral but shimmery
eye lock so it's the one I been reaching
for the most which is why it's a little
dirty now well I just think it's really
beautiful it's such a gorgeous robust
package I mean you probably paying a lot
for the package here but it's very
pretty but a random one but I just saw
this now we got to throw this away
it's the Lancome new tricks royal man's
intense men's intense nourishing
restoring hand cream I'm literally at
the bottom of this I use this every
single night it really is intensive
restoring it's very rich it's time it
last minute let me just say all of us
yeah it's it's rich but still like
malleable I hate it when the
moisturizers are so rich that the like
this journey and you feel like got a
warm or not it's got a really beautiful
smell it's just smells very clean your
hands feel beautifully moisturized I
feel great now
yeah it's been a massive favorite since
I've been using it I just want to buy
this again and on my lips let's just
talk about those cuz it's two favorite
product again I think I'm gonna talk
about them in the blogs first one being
the Honda booty liquid matte this is in
sugar mama yeah sugar mama it's a kind
of peachy toned nude I don't have to go
that peachy but I'm quite diggin they're
a little bit peachy tone nude liquid
matte and then to get a little bit of a
lighter tone I've got a lot of highlight
here now to get a slightly lighter tone
and to make it a little more to make
even more matte just to give this effect
that I've got going on here the Laura
Mercier extreme velour extreme matte
lipstick in respect it's just a really
great color
I mean look nice it's a perfect nude
it's just that tan brown nude for doing
the whole lips you can it's very very
nude if you love that very kind of like
almost dead lip look which looks amazing
some people this is perfect
but I think for ombre it's from it
really is a dream and I'm a big fan of
the consistency now that lipstick I
really really want to mention as well
it's the Galant Rouge G lipsticks
they're just beautiful there's like 15
to collect or is 18 15 to 18 to collect
different cases it's such an innovative
idea that everyone can have their own
different cases then you choose your
lipstick color it's also number two it's
like their new D shade but the
consistency is just that classic
lipstick vibe it's not dry
it's not over the top it looks like a
satin style finish but they just look
gorgeous and I mean having that full
mirror as well to weigh in your handbag
it's just super happy super handy so I
just wanted to give a little shout out
to them because I think they're just a
very innovative beautiful idea in a
beauty world that sometimes can get a
little bit samey it's nice to see
something a little bit more innovative
okay I really do feel so bougie in this
jacket today I was in a bit of a
headspace is like I just want to feel
like nice so I've put on my bow man
jacket and then this is very cute I just
found this in my jewelry draw today I
was like definitely gonna wear this this
is monica vinegar it's a little V and I
love it really reminds Rachel the
Louboutin necklaces that they brought
out but I thought it was really quite
keep that for today so I'm diggin it I'm
diggin it right okay one thing actually
favored at the moment is jewelry I knew
there's a reason I was mentioning it and
well as people that likes to be quite
chilled with their jewelry some days
they don't even bother wearing it I
usually wear a watch because my watch is
my favorite thing in the world I'm in
the midst of potentially buying a brand
new one I can't wait to show you when I
get it because watches it is my favorite
thing but I'm really really into my
jewelry again at the moment and delicate
very feminine usually quite tiny cute
jewelry is my thing but as he may have
seen in a recent video I bought a few
bits from Dior and I really really liked
them just as that statement my costume
jewelry vibe this one just says as yadi
or across in this gold vintage metal
they keep doing and then this one is I
mean you've probably seen this a lot a
lot of people have this ring but I just
think it's beautiful and I love but it's
more of this is it palladium maybe
almost like a deep silver and it's got
these little gems around it and it's got
the B and up the B means lots of makes
it's kind of like the Manchester symbol
so that's why I'll say I have to get
this ring and then this one comes in a
pair with this one and it's got the
Marino glass heart on it and CD so big
fan of those I'm just wearing my do your
try balls I always wear these are the
minis I get asked this a lot these are
the minis I think these ones are the one
centimeter size and they do go up to
about a 1.6
I much prefer these only have quite
small ears so I prefer the tiny tribals
but I'm just really loving jewelry
there's a lot of things at the moment do
you are that I would love so in love and
but I mean just just wearing to kind of
pull a few my favorites out on my face
different things which is tangled what
one of my favorite things I always wear
is my do your necklace this is the rules
devar comes in lots of different types
of metals and it's double-sided so on
one side is mother-of-pearl backing it's
got diamond to the center and then on
the other side is the mother-of-pearl
backing and you can just sort of have
that so it's like dual a dual style
necklace you can either way where an
either way and then another one from
Dior if you're going for the more Goldy
colors but this is another one that I
absolutely love and I wear a lot
actually it's a sister your star and
it's got a little gemstone on it but it
just looks with a cute on big fan so
I've been mixing I met also wants
because I usually just go Silver's you
know but I'm quite enjoying a little bit
of gold then there's another brown Dutch
Lee and this necklace I'm a big fan of I
really like the chain on this it's very
delicate but it isn't like my other one
hopefully can just see it's a little
unusual sterling silver plaque and with
a little star cut into it almost like a
North Star kind of symbol and either
side it's just a full plate round plate
but it's beautiful this is from a brand
called edge of Ember I'll leave a link
down below but this is quite a cute
little independent brand and I'm a big
fan oh and then also these have lenses
like all my favorite jeweler brands all
in one thing and my Thomas Sabo watch as
well huge fan of Thomas Sabo I've got a
lot of Thomas Alva jewelry as well so
yeah this is everything I had out today
I just put everything on quickly and I
was like actually this is a big favorite
right now so I'll talk about it okay
I'm gonna finish with a couple of
clothes to chat about seeing as I'm not
seeing you guys since before I did quite
a lot of my different trips thought I
would mention some bikinis because I'll
so where so many and I just wanted to
kind of shout out some of my favorites
here
first of all River Island are absolutely
killing it by the way I am loving
everything that's on river island right
now when it comes to swimwear this being
one of them and I wore this recently
instantly and had loads of people asking
me about it it's got a bit of a thong
bomb if you're into that I'm quite into
that I find a little bit more flattering
on me but some great cutouts just pulls
right across and ties over your boobs it
also has you know you can adjust the
straps you can make a bit longer you can
buy a bigger size but I just love the
fit they brought it out fully in this
orange shade here and one that looks to
be in like a minty green
like this maybe bit lighter but a minty
green and I've just ordered it because
I'm a little bit obsessed with this
style I think it's awesome so that's one
of my favorites my favorite ever bikini
I think because it does it makes me feel
amazing it's this one from Melissa oh -
get a lot of my bikinis from Beach Cafe
it's just such an awesome site and
that's where I got this from it just
suits me I love the color it just makes
you look really tanned when you are tan
and when you talk to talent it's just a
beautiful fit and then the bottoms are
not too big on the balm and just make
you feel great so I wanted to mention
that too and a secondary pair these are
from pili q another brand that does
create a lot of very flattering swimwear
and this is just a very cute top I like
the drawstrings around the back of here
the color is amazing
anything pastel anything fast away I'm
into right now it comes to swimwear and
again the balm is really cute and it
just sort of rides up nicely into a bit
the thong style Brazilian style yeah big
fan I love those that quickly mention
shoe favor it has to be the EMDR because
I literally haven't take them off
they're really getting very battered and
bruised now I've worn them for a couple
of trips I just absolutely love them
they're just extremely comfortable
they're a great thing just to throw on
with most outfits I adore the Mexican
style straps this really comfortable I
mean in honestly these are about 720
pounds to buy from the boutique and I
think you can also buy them online
actually and if you do want to example
if you do want to try them and you're
not that keen on going into the boutique
for any reason you can buy these online
pretty sure and you can also send them
back a fire online it's the only place
you can buy G or and send it back it's
online so if you did get them you could
try them on and see what you thought and
then send them back if you don't want to
keep them and it's free to return so
just a thought there in case any of you
were wondering these are available to
order online and I love them and it's
got my usual side day so okay I need to
mention this bag this is a big bag
favorite and I think it's so cute the
mulberry I mentioned this bag in a
luxury haul as it arrived to my door but
I haven't stopped wearing it since I've
been wearing it here and away I love the
color the size of the bag is perfect
size it looks cute over the shoulder it
looks cute just to be held like this
looks cute as a crossbody as well I just
think this is such a gorgeous new style
from albright and I think it's gonna be
I imagine this is probably gonna be one
of their bestsellers because it's just
really beautiful and it comes in lots of
different colors they also do more of a
beige Etan shade that I'm sure that
Josie halves which is really gorgeous I
just wanted to go for something a bit
more like mustardy and a color I didn't
already have and I think this is
beautiful I honestly think it's gorgeous
and just one or two things to mention in
terms of fashion me and M I went back
onto me and n just won my absolute
favorite like premium high street stores
and I found this blouse which is very me
just a silky white simple smooth high
neck blouse I love it it has no sleeves
as well so you can wear it for so many
different types of days and weather
conditions and just tucking this into
jeans I've took a listen to trousers it
just makes you look really put together
I'm big big fan of me now and they're
silk ranges and this is just really
beautiful as well I thought I mentioned
that and in fact the way I've been
wearing it is with these trousers and I
saw this and I just wanted some shorter
leg wide leg trousers that were super
casual but could be dressed up as well
and I found these and they are also so
comfortable they look awesome they've
got a bit of a cup like a clopped vibe
to them with the shape I love the paper
bag the paper bag waist is what makes it
though with this big boat they're just
really flattering and it comes wear them
with heels just to add that more like
sophisticated find it the other thing I
absolutely have to mention I picked this
up with the day in Phoenix when I went
for my Newton grief in Phoenix which was
so much fun the vlog for that is coming
out next week by the way
oh and I hopefully will be doing a big
giveaway by the way for my 100th vlog it
won't be in the next vlog because I did
believe that was gonna be number 100
this is gonna correct up on me but very
very soon and then we're doing really
big giveaway for you guys so this dress
this is such a great piece for wardrobe
goes fully right down to the floor it's
a full maxi black silk with these pink
printed roses all over it to be honest
if I've seen this in the Hungarian ever
picked it up but trying it on it looks
amazing on it's so flattering that it
comes a little belt that cinches you in
around the waist and just go throw on it
into a
shirtdress but a full maxi shirt dress
very very flattering and I'm just super
pleased it's nice sure what guys I'm
going to end it there I've checked
through a lot of things here and yeah
