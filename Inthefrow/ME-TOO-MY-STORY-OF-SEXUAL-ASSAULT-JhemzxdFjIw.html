usual as you've probably seen from the
title this is a video I've been meaning
to film now for the past few weeks and
wasn't really sure how to start it or
how to go about it and it was only
tonight when I've just been filming a
few videos and my lights are set up and
I was about to back away and I thought
you know what I'm just gonna sit down
I'm just gonna talk to the camera and
talk to you guys about my own
experiences when it comes to sexual
assault so a lot of you have probably
been following along good day the news
about Harvey Weinstein and all these
other directors and people that are
coming out now in the news as being
predatory males primarily manipulating
women pushing women into horrible
situations that they couldn't really
control and in most cases also
assaulting them the more and more news
articles I keep seeing the more I am
stunned that they haven't yet locked up
these men for this yeah it says it's
just really battling me as to why these
men are going to rehab rather than being
sentenced I don't really quite
understand why the punishment is not
much more harsh for these kind of things
that have been happening but today I
read a case where an actress said she
was raped by Harvey Weinstein about 9 or
10 years ago so I'm guessing more and
more these stories going to start
surfacing and I hope we're gonna see a
lot more justice for these women but
then it kind of led me to see a lot of
different people were talking about this
some youtubers had their own experience
and stories and was so brave as to share
them on the internet on YouTube and I
honestly I really don't want this
conversation to die out the amount of
different news stories that we see now
day to day in press one horrific
instance happening after the next news
is just moving faster than ever
and then these massive stories and these
massive experiences that are happening
and just sort of being pushed along by
the next massive thing that's happening
and it's there's a little worrying and I
feel like we need to keep this
conversation going because it cannot be
allowed to continue there needs to be
much harsher punishments for these kind
of acts on men and on women and there
needs to be a lot more advice out there
in education for everyone in terms of
how to deal with this sort of sexual
assault or attacks who to go to who to
speak with
guess the kind of ethics and morals
behind all of this in honesty but yes so
no so I wanted to sort of mention a few
of my own experiences in fact a couple
of weeks ago on Twitter I saw that
Caroline herons had mentioned one of her
own experiences I think that she said
she was groped when she was 8 or 9
months pregnant I think and she was
asking people to discuss other
experiences that they had had and it was
crazy reading that thread of different
women and men who had been assaulted
it's some way or another and whilst I
was going to write my own experiences in
that threat I felt it would be better to
kind of open up to you guys in a way to
hope this conversation would continue
hopefully some of you may be able to
potentially relate if anything has
happened to you potentially we go
discussion going hopefully it might help
you to share or even not to share maybe
just to sort of hear that it does happen
to other people as well and that you're
not alone I guess it's just in a way to
help this overall I am just one of many
many many to many people who have been
assaulted in some way and I guess it
just needs to get to a point where this
doesn't happen anymore so I guess
different experiences range from for
having my bomb groped at different times
out and about or in clubs that's
happened a few times it's not okay no
one should be able to touch you without
your prior permission it's just it's
just wrong it shouldn't happen and one
thing that did happen to me back when I
was 17 I remember I was out in Wigan and
I just come out of a club it made about
1 a.m. and a guy who must have been
maybe this mid-30s walked by me he
literally kind of grabbed and cocked my
vagina with his hand and then kind of
looked at me in this really odd way and
then continued walking away yes it's a
really horrible weird experience I mean
I was only 17 regardless of age it
should not happen to anyone but it was
just the way that his demeanor and his
mannerism was so odd and scary the way
he kind of looked at me like this was
like an okay thing and oh it was just it
was just a horrible experience I don't
like I vividly remember I kind of
remember what it looks like I mean this
was what 10 years ago I vividly remember
what it looks like and exactly what
happened I mean I start shouting abuse
at this guy I was effing and blinding as
garrix I was like what the hell just
happened but I don't think I actually
even told anyone I feel at this point a
load of my friends were kind of chatting
behind me and kind of hammer
about something no one even saw it
happened I don't even think I really
mentioned it after that's like what I
was just so confused but that kind of
thing just again should not happen it's
just no one has the right to touch
anybody else what you want to see main
thing that did happen to me that was
extremely bizarre it was actually
something that I reported and it ended
up going on to crime watch last it
wasn't it was about 18 months ago now I
think maybe two years ago but it's
something that happened to me maybe four
years ago now about in Manchester when I
was lecturing so I was lecturing at the
University of Manchester and I would
walk home by Piccadilly I would go into
Piccadilly to get something like
groceries from Sainsbury's and now to
cut back out and I would go up to where
I lived which was just behind Piccadilly
station but on this occasion that's been
sayings but it's got some things I was
coming out of station and there was a
guy behind me he must have been I was
about 24 he must have been late 20s
maybe just early 30s I remember he was
right in front of me on this escalator
going down and he completely turned
around I mean this happens quite often
and it really knows when people stare at
you and it happens a lot on escalators
especially that you'd be happy hind
someone and someone literally turn
around and stare at you when you on
escalator it just makes you feel so
uncomfortable but this guy did this to
me and he was turning around look at me
sasa Scott was looking anywhere else but
him until I could get off this escalator
and I walked away at this point he kind
of veered left and I feared right cuz I
was gonna start going down another set
of escalators and at this point I didn't
realize what this guy had gone left seen
that I'd gone right turn round and come
after me I was walking after me
so I get on this second set of
escalators down and to exit Piccadilly
and this guy got onto the escalators
right behind me literally the step right
behind me I was kind of none the wiser I
just got on this escalator like he
literally stood right behind me on the
step and grabbed my book at this point I
just kind of I kind of jumped first of
all to realize Warren was literally
right next to me like right behind me it
almost made it look like he was my
boyfriend he was that close to me so
that kind of shocked me but also the
fact that someone kind of grabbed my
bone and the kind of person that gives
people to benefit the doubt and I don't
jump to conclusions too easily when
maybe I should do so I thought maybe
he's accidentally touched me as he's
walked too close to me so but just in
case I decided to actually gonna walk
forward and down this escalator to get
away from him just just in case
in case he is a bit odd I will walk
ahead at this guy so I start walking
down this escalator well there was a
couple right at the bottom of the
escalator completely taken up the the
whole aisle this isn't like in London we
have to be on the Left all right you can
just people to stand where they want in
front of done and they were blocking the
end of this escalator so I kind of I
walked as far as I could down it until I
was kind of nearing at the bottom and
just stood behind them cuz I couldn't
get past so I'm just waiting to get off
this escalator as it's coming in and
realized at this point that the guy had
walked right after me and at this point
again completely grabbed my bomb this
time there was no mistaking it was a
full-on grab and I literally jumped out
of my skin I was like this is just got
it's giving me like smooth feel a bit
funny think about it it just starts
shock that kind of moment of like terror
of what what the hell is this guy do and
this is weird behavior like I said I've
been in the situation before of guys
like taking a grab if he born which is
completely out of order but it's
something that you can hopefully walk
away from get away from as quickly as
possible but the fact that you've done
it twice to me purposefully he'd meant
to do it and he'd walked after me was
just for really really weird anyway so
at this point I walk off the escalator
and knowing that this guy's behind me
and groped me twice I literally stomped
my way out of the station like really
quickly walked like my fastest pace walk
I've ever done out of that station to
try and get home as quickly as possible
and I was walking up the road I've got
maybe maybe got 20 30 feet up this
street when I looked around just to
check if he was there and he was this
guy had come out behind me I was walking
up the street right behind where I was
so obviously then I was like like I was
freaked out I thought this guy was
following me I didn't know what was
going on who it was so we got to the
point on this street where the trams
from Piccadilly come out of the station
and they go across the road so the tram
signs came on to stop something up
there's a stop on this street it was her
to wait first tram to come out so by
this point I had to stop and he was also
walking up the road right behind me so
it got to a point so what I did was I
walked a very edge of this kerb I was
like she stood on the edge almost on the
road I wanted in my head I thought if I
go really far to the left he can't get
any more left therefore he asked on my
rights at least I know where he is I was
almost trying my best to try and take
control the switch
so it was on the right of me he walks up
and he's kind of looking me up and down
like I'm a piece of meat which was just
terrifying to be honest he stood there
Asset ROM left I almost kind of looked
down and kind of I said to say like you
can carry on walking I'm not walking
until you continue I didn't want him to
be behind me this point I wanted to be
able to see where he was and where he
was going and know he was in front of me
so I could go home without him following
me home
so I'm stood on the street with Trump's
is gone and as it I'm literally just
stood stopped still he decided to kind
of continue sort of stopped looking at
me it's not look at me and continues
with a sly little smile in his face so
at this point I know it's in front of me
so I start very slowly walking I just
wanted to let as much space in between
me and him as possible it kept turning
around at different points a lot of
check house there and I let's just solve
plodding and thinking thinking about
what my next steps were gonna be what
exactly I was gonna do next
anyway so we get to the point of this
street where I would usually turn right
underneath a big railway bridge it's
quite dark it's very secluded it's not
the kind of place you would want to go
quite often it's known as being a bit
the kind of red-light district of
Manchester it's not the safest place but
I would walk there only officer with it
being daylight and you it's only a
little bridge it's not massive but the
same time I wouldn't want to be under
there with someone that's just groped me
so anyway I see him turning right
underneath this bridge there's like no
way in hell am I gonna walk that way now
that's my way home so I stopped on this
corner for weather bridges I just
stopped right here so he couldn't see
where I was if he look back but that's
right here and I literally literally
reach into her back for my phone to ring
Alex just to let him know what happened
until like no I was a little bit scared
and see where he was and Casey was
around so I get on my phone this
pointless guy comes back out from this
railway bridge so I'm sound I just kind
of like jump like oh my god he's back
again I just don't know what the hell
this guys doing and at this point I'm
like she's still there on my phone
trying to pretend that I don't see him
and just shouldn't like look busy and
honest is this is a Main Street like
it's not the busiest street ever but
it's a busy street along the side of
Piccadilly and there's a massive red
boss right here that were taxis and
everything and I'm stood there does my
phone and this guy walks right around
the side of me comes around the side of
me grabs hold
my bottom shakes it in his hand and
blows me a kiss at the same time and I
can't even explain that feeling of
feeling so scared not sure what to say
I didn't I mean I didn't say anything
this entire time thinking back now I
would love to just be there and just be
like who the hell to think about hell
you do it might cause a major major
storm and so other people can see this
pervert is around but in but you can
never think what you do in this
situation you can always think about it
but like I don't know what I do someone
did that to me I just effing blind at
them and it probably puts in the face
like fair enough and I mean if you've
got loves that kind of confidence and
fair enough and I mean I'm quite a
confident person but I was so kind of
terrifying scared in that moment that I
wasn't really sure what else to do and I
just wanted to be silent I wanted it to
just go away so I could get home safe I
just wasn't sure how to react anyway but
I mentioned it to my friends and to Alex
and they all agreed that I should bring
the Transport Police at Piccadilly just
so kind of mention it just the way that
he had behaved was very very odd it
wasn't just a opportunists it devoted
bomb grab it was a guy he would actually
tried to follow me home out of the
station so I did I told the Transport
Police he took extremely seriously they
were actually brilliant all props to
them because they were brilliant with me
and really really took it seriously when
I thought to myself like in the grand
scheme of things much much much worse
things happen to women and men out there
and I realized that at the same time I
thought if this guy does this now then
he used to say what he could do to
another woman oh man down line so I
wanted to kind of make it now anyway
they took it really seriously like I
said it went to crime watch turned out
that when they looked on the security
cameras they saw the whole thing
this guy had literally ran out of the
station after me to follow me home after
he had left me he they went back into
the station that you can't obviously
followed me out the station won't even
mean to leave the station he just
followed me he went back into the
station got on a train went to somewhere
else and during that time he also groped
another woman on the train I find it
really hard to kind of know what to call
this man without being too offensive I
don't want to offend anyone but to me it
was just a bit of I just I'm just gonna
cut I'm just gonna say it was just
really really odd it was odd behavior
yeah I don't know how else a kind of
verbalize my thoughts to
without being too offensive but so that
was my experience they never found this
guy I don't know how because the
pictures they managed to get of him was
so clear and it went on Crimewatch
should obviously desist maybe the people
that watch crime watch we're not the
people that knew him unfortunately
what she's a shame I just hope that no
one else has been attacked by this guy
in any way since to be honest but as I
said the main point of this video was to
share my experience in a hope that maybe
if something like this has happened to
you something similar or even much much
worse and you are hiding it and you want
to share it and you're unsure if you
should I mean I'm not a psychiatrist I'm
not counselor I'm not someone that can
technically help you but I would like to
think that any issue like this is
weighing on your mind it's always better
shared because it I find it kind of half
that issue if someone else can try and
help you with it it kind of takes a
little bit of weight off your shoulders
so I would honestly try and share if
you're able to with a friend with your
parents with a grandparent with anyone
that you can feel that you can trust
really I'll also leave lots of links and
numbers down below for different places
that you can ring if you just need to
speak to someone if anything like this
has happened to you before if you have
been or are being sexually assaulted
then maybe one of these numbers may help
you but like I said the main point was
that I want to continue this
conversation going I want men and women
to feel like they have the right to
speak up and to be heard and for their
story to be taken seriously because this
is a time especially now when I feel
these stories are really starting to be
taken seriously which i think is a great
thing and only then will things start to
change
so I guess thank you so much for
watching I realize this was quite a long
video but I just wanted to kind of
explain my experiences and I hope to
help any of you guys that maybe needed
some help obviously it's very different
to my usual videos but I thought this is
extremely important it's just something
that I feel quite strongly about yeah so
thank you so much for watching I really
hope it's helped please do start
discussions down in the comments if it
will help you all links and help will be
in description bar and yeah thank you
for being here bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
