special day is Megan and Harry's wedding
day I really wanted to create her makeup
look from the day so I thought that I
would watch along I would see her makeup
decide what products I think she may
have used and recreate it for myself for
you guys I have had so much fun putting
this together I've been watching on with
the wedding I've been getting ready I
just thought this would be such a lovely
video to make kind of as I'm watching it
create it for you guys
there's my full interpretation I don't
yet know exactly what she's used on her
face there's a few parts in here that
I've heard she is a big fan of so I've
used some of those as well as a wedding
day look absolutely love this if you do
want to see how I recreated this
interpretation of Megan's makeup then
please do you keep watching okay
such an exciting day I am really excited
about this I've never really done a look
for someone and I've been wanting to for
so long kind of like recreating a
celebrity's look I really famous persons
look or something like that and I've
never had the opportunity I've never
managed to pick the right person so
today I thought this is a perfect day
and I wanted to do it as it all was
unfolding I thought I'd be more fun that
way though right let's just get into
this just the transparency as well this
video is partially sponsored by Giorgio
Armani as you guys know I'm a huge fan
of their makeup a lot of their makeup I
will probably be using for my own
wedding day and I think it's just a firm
favourite for so many people for their
own wedding day so it's just kind of a
perfect fit I think I think products
will be Armani a few products will be
everything else I've let you come to my
jewels and picked up everything that I
would personally think that I would want
to use or that she might be using I've
already got a little bit of moisturizer
and under-eye cream on I'm kind of like
watching the wedding whilst I'm doing it
I'm going to start off with the Armani
Prima moisturizing balm a few reasons
it's super glowy it's really hydrating
and it's an amazing amazing base for
makeup
it's just wonderfully glowy oh that
Camilla oh and Charles total love
Charles he's so cute
okay well it's hot it's nice she's
gorgeous one exciting day for them all
yeah this is makes your skin look so
glowy and beautiful the Queen the Queen
is here
yeah I love her the Queenie she's so
cute this is makes your skin look so
glowy
it gives that really gorgeous texture
for makeup on top so perfect absolutely
adore this product so nicely moisturize
I'm so excited to see her dress her hair
her makeup right primer I'm going to use
the one that I think is just one of the
best out there and it's law by Gillen
I'm just gonna apply that with my hands
actually just with these gold specks in
here it's just really feels really
hydrating on the skin it's not beautiful
primer on top of the moisturizer this is
gonna be a double whammy and I'm just in
my gown because you know I like to get
ready my in my gown and this is how I
would do it my wedding morning imagine
that Megan Pro looked a lot more room
fancy than I do know because this is me
personally doing this I wanted to add a
bit of an illuminating base to this as
well so when I use my Vita Liberata
Beauty blur not necessary but this is
definitely what I will be using on my
wedding day and I imagine that Megan all
of you something
beautifully illuminating and it's a glow
as a softness it also evens out the
complexion and it makes another 1/8
invasive foundation you don't have to
have used this and the primer but I'm
just going all out with the things that
will keep everything in place all day
whatever base that you have that makes
your skin lovely and glowy like this I
mean I doesn't love this product
oh my gosh she is a vicious she's
throwing a veil oh wow you want to go in
like oh wow the hair up got hair look a
lot like pull together in a gorgeous
like curly bond
oh my gosh don't stop the livestream oh
wow I thought it would be starting to
move beautiful satin incredible train oh
wow it looks really nervous it's
absolutely beautiful stress its train is
insane its veil more light the veil is
insane its church what an incredible day
for them more perfect weather
sorry Berry's not gonna go I'm gonna
suck rising into I'm gonna cry in a
minute getting emotional oh there's
Prince Charles what was wrong with me oh
god I'm gonna get my dies oh she was
like she's got quite a deep smoky eye I
um there's some pressure for this opera
singer right now the whole world is
watching you right at this moment
are you sure to make up now oh oh it's
so natural it's really glowy really
glowy natural not much contour very
light amount of blush and bronze God
bear the smokey eye deep bronzes oh this
is gorgeous I love this lipstick she's
where it's like a coral pink I'm
thinking what amazed of this okay so for
the base I'm going to use luminous silk
foundation from Armani
according to her former makeup artist
this is her favorite foundation and she
likes to use it on a beauty blunder so
that's what I'm gonna use today for
chances Val that she's using her
favorite it's quite a medium coverage
apparently Megan likes to Eric's it
still shows her freckles through the
foundation I wish I had a few more but I
don't it's also amazing for weddings
because there's no SPF which means
there's no flashback it's also very
buildable you can keep building this
throughout the day and it will not start
to cake it just merges together
beautifully it's just nice to style my
foundations for you this is some of the
best so you can just keep building it in
your t-zone for example you could add a
little light layer so it's quite medium
and I keep building in the areas that
you like but overall it's your skin but
better quite
natural dewy glow finish and it's a
summation for weddings so that's what
I'm going to use on a nice clean fresh
Beauty but under what I'm going to do is
apply that directly onto a brush it's
gonna dab this around the face from I
can see here of Megan she is and very
very natural does not look like she's
wearing very much foundation so actually
I think she might be wearing this
foundation it's actually so nice to do
this tutorial as it happening I'm so
glad I decided to do this it's just
really nice to be recreating it on the
actual wedding day like to have this
video in my archives now will be rather
nice an absolute they're really good for
me to do this anyway for just for ideas
for my own wedding
- sorry I'm in the recycle I used to get
this look as I saying you can just add
more into places that you want to it a
little bit more in my t-zone this coral
pink lip is stunning and literally
racked my brains of which pink coral lip
I should use for this because it's
beautiful it almost looks quite so what
matte as well actually it's almost
someone between the two I feel that
matches my skin so well today
I just turned and of course after add a
little bit bronze and all of that it
looked pretty great can you see how it's
there's something natural yet still
quite flawless about this foundation
it's picking up the light without
looking extremely over-the-top dewy and
it's really perfected the skin and like
I said you can just keep building this
up so this is your wedding day and you
want to do top pops you could just keep
working into this and it won't get cakey
we'll just keep merging concealer I'm
gonna go with the bare minerals bare Pro
concealer then use that on line Bobby
Brown brush I always like to use
something that's quite peachy here and
then I like to go over it there's
something a little lighter so that was
shade neutral 10 go in with this one
which is neutral 3
I mean looking at all these pictures and
watching live feed now it doesn't like
she's got absolutely loads on so I think
I'm gonna leave like that it's kind of
flawless it's not over the top there
isn't too much Shawn it's quite nice and
light underneath the eyes I'm gonna put
on a little bit of one of my old
favorites a by Terry Baume De Rose lip
balm brand new pot from Selfridges I'm
very excited about it I used to love
absolutely love this lip balm press that
in right I think I'm going to I'm gonna
do brows first actually a whole look is
extremely natural here I mean I'm quite
glad now I've had my eyebrows down just
a little bit a little bit darker a bit
more like a little bit more like if it
looks like she's lips you just fill them
the tiniest bit that's barely much going
on here with the brows I'm gonna use the
Armani eye and brow maestro and my one
and only the shows your Imani
eyebrow brush it's the only one I've
used for years the one I swear by so
just keeping this really natural really
I'm just gonna follow my natural shape
fill it in it any little bits that just
need touch you're feeling again yeah it
looks kind like she's kind of got them
brushed up here quite straight across
the top yeah and then very similar to my
own brow shape actually it's not overly
perfected but it's not also super
natural brow so I'm just kind of gonna
do them the way I do my own it looks
very similar I feel a little bit extra
here cuz it was a little bit I'm just
into a nice easy point brushing them
through to keep it a little bit more
natural
yeah and then a bit more not got much
product here and it's just brushed up
just like that really really easy and
I'm just gonna set that with the benefit
already set brow this is an absolute
favorite of mine at the moment it really
does keep them in place all day just
into a very simple eyebrow shape right
when I start working into the skin a
little more obvious such beautiful
freckles
when I used to brand new Armani neo nude
fusion powders these are insane the way
that these work is that the powders they
were once liquids and they've been baked
down into cement powder which means that
when you add them onto your face onto
say
you've got loads of moisturizer on is
any skin it's a little tacky and damp
this will kind of a dear to moisture in
your face and almost foam this veil they
are so highly out like advance to like
the technology in these it's amazing but
they also work wonderfully is like
setting powders I'm gonna use shade 5.5
here and I'm gonna add it into areas
where I just want to add a touch of
coverage but also to start setting down
areas of the face on this I'm just using
the brand new Real Techniques finish
brush I don't want to take away too much
juzo because her skin looks really dewy
today and we should have more of a tan I
don't look at all time today okay
there's no real contour that I can see
it's just a wonderful bronze so I'm
gonna use the Armani fusion powder this
time in number eight which gives a
really pretty bronze I'm gonna use my
Armani bronzer brush for this so they
can see it's just runs it's sweet high
up on the cheek as well as blush but
we'll have that in a second
she's got it up here around the top of
her hairline I mean she has incredible
cheek so she's got top of the cheeks a
little more covered so sweeping this
down the neck and onto the decolletage
but imma lecture just doing big motions
sweeping it over the cheek which I don't
really want to look contoured as such it
just needs to look Rumsey and sunkissed
I mean she looks absolutely beautiful
sunkissed it looks like she's got a
touch of bronzer here and here it's
honestly works so beautifully as a
bronze and it's so buildable that's what
I can see I can just see this like this
worked up over the face before it meets
hard because she's also very tanned
compared to myself now for blusher it is
a really pretty coral toned blush so had
a little look in my collection and I've
got the benefit Galef is it gala for Nia
which could add a nice feel and what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to kind of dip my
brush into the fusion powder number a
and then into the California and it will
hopefully give me quite nice warm warm
toned coral I really like that actually
it's really pretty I'm gonna go with the
Armani kabuki and just blend all of that
there together a little I said it she's
been contoured or anything so I just
don't want any real harsh lines here
well I think I'm just gonna add as well
it's a little touch-up on my absolute
favorites
the Estee Lauder bronze goddess summer
palette still available this shade looks
like it could work quite nicely as well
that's a deep and then up a tiny touch
and she's got it quite high up here on
her cheeks and of this section here
that's cuz she has wonderful cheekbones
I mean that works quite nicely actually
in terms of the shade that shade it's
really really nice but I've still got
the glow of that gala Fournier beneath
again just blend out this brush is so
nice if it's really really nice I think
I want to start using this every day
actually just to blend everything
together my skin looks really lovely
actually I'm just gonna add a tiny bit
more on a smaller brush of the powder
from earlier just a little bit more into
this area I'm definitely not shiny with
that I'm glowing and I mean you can
still see see this powder isn't taken
away that glow or whatsoever it's just
setting everything down keeping
everything wonderfully glowy I think
this is definitely coming my favorite
powder I am a big fan of this so far now
in terms of highlight it looks very very
very minimal and it looks a bit golden
toned so do you know what I'm gonna use
I wasn't going to use it but actually I
think it's perfect for this yeah it
looks like a really pretty gold which
looks just like this my Marnie the a
highlight in number 10 which is the
golden shade there is also number 11
which I'd like to use look off cuz it's
a little bit more champagne E but I
think the majority of this highlight
from the looks of it is a golden toned
creamy wash I'm just going to take that
onto the back of my hand
not beautiful mainly this area here that
she seems to have highlight so I don't
want to take it too low I just want it
to me mainly this section I'm gonna take
my Beauty Blender and ensure I've not
got too much that perfect now she seems
to have a little bit of highlighter
yeah well very subtly which is why this
works really well as highlights it's not
too over-the-top just cuz just catching
the light here it's not doing the loads
you need it yeah yeah okay so her eyes
like I've got a picture of her blinking
and it's just
taupey brown with a touch of liner and a
bit of a deeper brown see outside okay
wonderful bright so I believe we have
the skin completed now do you know what
I'm just gonna add a little bit just to
ensure we definitely got that chewiness
that she seems to have but without a
little bit of the RMS Luminizer
literally at the tiniest little bit just
on these sections here I don't want too
much glow we don't want too much glow
going down okay
great great I'm really really liking
this look a lot I'm gonna start off it
looks like she's got quite a lovely
creamy base all up to here so I'm gonna
kick yourself with the Too Faced natural
eyes palette which I'm really digging at
the moment right I'm gonna start off
with heaven it's a really great creamy
pale shade I'm working out straight up
to the brow bone just a light sweeps out
all over the lid so we can start working
into it but it definitely looks like
she's got it like to tone up here
especially I'm gonna go into the naked
heat pallet I'm gonna use this one here
vibrate I know and I'm just gonna work
out over this area it's a little
creamier building up those shade yeah
that's great
just nice and creamy and a great set
base now just so I can start working in
with these Browns I'm just gonna do what
I would you
usually do which is out a bit of a
cliched now she's not gone crazy on this
just ah she does have a little bit the
cliched down though I'm gonna go for
this one here strip poker this is super
subtle so it's not something you're
gonna see too heavily it's just gonna
help us get that transition nicely
through the socket of the lid see house
looks a lot is really nice I just prefer
to lay down a crease shade like this
it's quite subtle as it helps when you
then put on a darker shade not gonna go
over it if you like it almost lays down
you're out buying a little bit I'm gonna
use some of these from Burberry I
absolutely love these parts and they
have that kind of style of Sheen to them
from I can see from the pictures so I
think I'm gonna use these I think this
one here is mink on my Sigma blending e
25 brush I just feel like this sheen
that I can see on our eyes and it's sort
of almost like minke Brown to this inner
start of it I just feel like this could
this could work so I'm just gonna go
straight in
just follow my eye socket really you see
that soft topi
taupey brown I'm working that right up
and she's got a very round shape so it
just literature comes around there's no
wing here just to sort of shape
really okay I'm liking actually the base
first of all and then I think that when
we start adding extra colors it will all
dark not what this will be a lovely mink
around base and actually this is an
amazing shade for a wedding day I'm
gonna do I'm gonna use my Too Faced
natural love palette we'll use this one
here spoiled I don't want to go too warm
it doesn't look all that warm working
nicely over that cream base as well that
I put down from Burberry now I know I
should do my eyeshadow first but it's
about habits mine I never do my
eyeshadow first I don't know why and now
I just want something that's deeper than
that so I'm gonna go for this
the modern Renee socks palette anastacio
Beverly Hills I'm gonna use on the end
side press ombre
I absolutely love this look and when
he's a little bit of hit this here
Primavera yakin a spot a little bit of
gold here on the pictures and what I've
seen anyway so I'm gonna put a little
bit of gold and this in a corner she's
wearing eyeliner so I'm gonna go for I'm
gonna go for tomforde eyeliner this is a
high definition eyeliner in Ebony line
excuse me one second well I just tight
line my eye have to look right in the
mirror mmm I can see her eyeliner goes
all the way down into this in a corner
here and then just round into a tear
ducts as well I just want to do a little
bit of eyeliner as well on the very top
lashes just to add some definition there
as well and these might um forward
angled brush just to kind of blend that
out over top welcome to the rest of the
eye I don't want it to look like a line
I just want it to look like a gradient
down to this darker darker lash line she
doesn't really have anything coming down
some lower lash so I'm just gonna do a
tiny little bit to connect the two and
that is virtually it just what I've got
left on my brush
keep those quite rounded otherwise a
lower lash line seems to be quite
natural oh she has yes a little bit it
looks like just a little bit of mascara
so I'm gonna use my Armani eccentric Oh
mascara just want my absolute favorites
I played my lower lashes a very light
coat with mascara she's not like she's
got very much on at all I would all see
you sis on my top lashes but I have
currently have my Nouveau lashes my SVS
lashes so don't need anything on there
right now in terms of her lashes yeah it
looks like she has a lovely thick set of
lashes on to be honest so I would not be
surprised if she also has some Russians
or something like this okay so how are
we looking now clean everything up
everything looks fine make sure that
this is all rounded okay and the last
thing I think we need to do is her lips
now this is very coral toned I'm almost
wondering if this would work but that's
kind of similar she look like she's
wearing any liner either
okay I've been playing around with some
lipstick I think I've got a winner I
think I've got a winner I'm trying to
get this perfect shade I'm gonna go for
a little tiny bit of liner because I
think that liner goes a long way who
needs my usual Rimmel just a cappuccino
liner and because she looks like she's
not wearing much unless you got it fully
real that almost like it's not there but
it just helps define the lips okay this
is what I think I want to go with this
is the Armani 300 now it's quite a
Coralie tone but hang with me here guys
hang with me I'm gonna pop that in cuz
he's just there's a lot of definition
here but he'll it okay so that's quite
orange it now over the top
I'm gonna add the Clinique melon pop in
oh five which is lighter a little Pinker
and still Coral in a block backs I don't
want too much shine I love that color
that color with this eye look is so nice
okay let me just double check again got
brows blushes a very light glow okay so
just I'm just putting a little white top
so I'm out of my gown and I've tied my
hair back I'll be honest I'd need a
proper stylist fail to get her look and
we've not yet seen Excel so she's
wearing could beautiful tiara and the
very little top so just kind of tied
everything back the other thing I want
to do is just add some Armani Prive he
wants to sue it's just the most
incredible scent and I think anyone
would love to wear this on their wedding
day so this is what I'm imagining she is
wearing some polygamy wearing this on my
wedding day it's just the most beautiful
smell amazing and the only other thing I
do want to do actually it's just add a
touch more liner to the lower lash line
skin tones darker and she has darker
hair so this area does look a little
darker than what I have done here so for
a little bit more how much you just saw
scrubbing that into my into my lashes
really nothing really defining I love
this
love this okay guys that is the whole
look complete I've had the best
afternoon creating this I really hope
you've enjoyed watching it like I said
this is my interpretation of Megan's
makeup I'm really looking forward
actually to find out exactly what she
did where I would put a good guess in it
being the Armani luminous silk
foundation I'm looking forward to seeing
exactly what lipstick exactly it was
because I think it's going to sell out
like hotcakes that's for sure I must
admit I think I've got quite close to it
with this and I really love this
combination the Armani with the Clinique
over the top the overall look I'm a big
big fan of I mean she looks absolutely
beautiful so I hope that you think I've
done her proud I'll leave everything
that I have put on here down below
linked in the description bar in order
that I used it as well as all the
brushes and of course a perfume but yeah
oh you've enjoyed this I've really
enjoyed watching along with the wedding
I'm actually so glad that I did this
today it's just a really nice thing to
remember the day and to have this in my
videos as something that I did on the
day as route reviewing what she was
wearing on her face interpreting what I
thought she might have been using so I
had the best time so hope you enjoy it
