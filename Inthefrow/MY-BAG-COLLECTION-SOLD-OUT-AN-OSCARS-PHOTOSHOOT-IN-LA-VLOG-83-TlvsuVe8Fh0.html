book for you guys to learn about just
lowest ideas about how to get jobs how
to get internships why need internships

to them at the LA I'm not sure if it's
lap here or LA Pierre hotel brand new

worn this it's like two years old a
little bit right gotta go
made it to melt studios for the bitola
brown shoe this is throwing arm haven't

into my like Hollywood red carpet look

so this is the beauty blog guys this is
brand-new from Vita Liberata I am in
shaved tuna my latte light so this is
like a blurring priming tanning that you
put this on a little your moisturizer
you kind of DAB it on quite sparingly
and it gives this like amazing glow like
luminous glow to the skin it's so nice
then my is the body blur is this a
sunless glow so with this brand new
formulation it also tells you as it's on
use it's self tanning so if you saw the
original body blur you stop see it's
kind of like body foundation in a way
just incredible glow but with this one
with the self tanning it means that you
can put it on where it's like you night
out look incredible and then wake up in
the morning and still have it like
applied and like it will have turned
your skin overnight as well amazing so
got this on as well

the nicest thing nice this moment so
lovely I'm just so great everyone could
be part of it like that and also amazing
news well it's a shame because when you
see this it'll be too late but amazing
news is that because of the amount of
you guys asking for a restock because
yeah then you are away and you still see
the launch until later and it was all
filled out etc me and my managers went
back to Strasser and said is there any
way we could look at maybe a restock or
anything we can do and so they have been
on the phones all morning with their
manufacturers and luckily the
manufacturers seeing that they're
potentially able to make another small
amount of each bag so very limited
supplies of each bag once again have
gone up on the website now to have
already sold out within an hour there's
a couple more left just crazy as thank
