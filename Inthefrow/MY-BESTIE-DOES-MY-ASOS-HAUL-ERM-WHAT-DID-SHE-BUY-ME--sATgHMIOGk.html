asshole this time my bestie does my Asus
whole pot I've already filmed this like
feels like ages ago like left here or
something
my bestie living over in Chicago she
went through a sauce she'd picked at
loads of things that she thought I would
like and she bought them for me I have
no idea what is in this bag
three heavy sized bag I think she said
there were nine things in this I think I
mean she knows me pretty well so I'm
pretty excited to look inside it back
right before I get into it first of all
if you are brand new here please do
subscribe if you're amazing to have you
back and do a lot of this kind of thing
so just hit that subscribe button down
below be amazing to have you and
secondly if you haven't already watched
our holiday Maldives vlog I would love
it if you watched it we had an amazing
holiday it was just simmering insane
resort and I know a lot of you guys
loved my last Maltese vlog so if you
haven't already seen it I leave it up on
the screen or I leave a link down below
so you can go watch it and I hope you
like it everything that I mention is
well in this whole be link down below in
order as well just to make it super easy
and also what I'm wearing just in case
any of you guys wonder cuz this is so
cozy right let's get into it
open it I see stripes I see print I see
spots okay oh well this is cute
oversized fit like shirt jacket now I
feel like I need to try this over
something that isn't this dress to
really get a good feel for this oh it's
quite nice so I like how can foxy it
feels and like straight you know what I
think over like a white tee and some
like leather or faux leather trousers or
leggings she knows that I like red and
she knows I like this kind of tomatoey
red right now so I think that's what
she's she's gone for here Jo I might put
on a white tee and just see what's going
out it's just got off though out the
wash this is mega creased
and I have nothing on my lower half some
opens new like mirror reflections around
right now
else you never see my panties no I would
not have picked this for myself sorry I
keep looking at this because this is
where my screen is so I'm like I'm using
this as a mirror for like spring or
summer like a throw on jacket it I
actually really really I'm trying to
show as much as I can
without showing off my pants the day
this video goes up I'm filming it so let
me know your opinions down below I can
then see what I want to keep well I'm
not gonna keep let me know right next
then okay this looks like it's a really
cute little red places she's gonna put
it right again just a little oh it's
really nice
chilly reminds mouth Rick so I'm really
into it so right now I've got two of
their dresses and this really reminds me
okay this is quite cute it's actually
not as like low v-neck as I thought I
still got my brown it's just about
hidden in there super cute like wide
fluted sleeves with an gorgeous like
gold necklace this would look really
cute
I quite like it I do John I'm gonna go
get some leather trousers he's got this
little slit here though that I think
would make this a much more spring or
summer appropriate like well I think it
might be a bit chilly but overall the
shape and fit it's really really nice
next thing in the bag it's just very
spring appropriate Rebecca oh no I
remember she said to me were you where
are you going next
and I said India so that's why I think
it's very spring for London right now
but it's because she got me things for
India why okay
this is really cute it feels quite thin
I must admit but let's see it on okay I
like it
it's very made like quite thin at the
same time in India with the heat this
would actually be really really nice I
like these wider gosh birds are being
very noisy aren't these wider like
fluted sleeves again very dainty
delicate feminine you could even like to
maybe yeah kind of cute so if you're on
the beach took into some shots if you're
at work took it into jeans or I like it
I like this a lot
next up we have zebras with shoes on
oh but it's quite cute on first thoughts
though I don't know if I'm gonna wear
and Sarah's that have heels on okay I
really feel like Harry Styles in this I
totally I can make this work Rebecca I'm
really sorry I know y'all have had a
vision we've had a vision for me babe
but I'm not sure quite daring to this
vision I literally feel like myself
um Adobe this with me I thought I can't
I can't make this I can't make this work
no no no no oh stop okay well I like oh
gosh yeah they're off let's go all the
way down here what does your mommy off
Mary Poppins I don't know I like it okay
let's see it is gonna know okay if this
fits like fitted then it's gonna be
great if not I'm just gonna like hoist
my bra straps here cuz I'm gonna take
them off yeah if this is gonna be it
like this literally needs to have about
an inch two inches pull them off this
what a shame
almost sighs this is you know top part
it's quite nice and the bottom half with
a ruffle is cube I do this to save
myself for them to move this camera see
okay so this is about them which was
quite cute
I really cute it's got this like goes up
in the middle here needs to be two
inches poor then shame
it's actually really cute I'm gonna
reorder this I think this could make a
really gorgeous summer dress like if in
the maldis on the beach or in Turkey
Spain us yes
hey you know it's my office so nice
gorgeous fine Rebecca now what is this
looks very very you Chi oh well this is
nice really nice
however in Aussie I'd often wear this
color of cream because sometimes I think
it it makes him look a bit funny but the
style looks really nice too
honestly like what is going on with
sizing them all actually needs like
three inches coming off it no I feel
like I'm wearing my grandma's curtains
in there don't I that doesn't flatter me
in the slightest I feel like I can
Victorian made hmm yeah I can't make
this look good Oakley it's too big
anyway sizing funny flora no masks no I
have not lost weight
thank you black straight it's like
palazzo pants right honestly cuz still
the week I got a comment it's like oh my

so these are the trousers sorry they are
playing funny beggars with the camera

much for my my behind I'm gonna finish
off to our could you hear because
