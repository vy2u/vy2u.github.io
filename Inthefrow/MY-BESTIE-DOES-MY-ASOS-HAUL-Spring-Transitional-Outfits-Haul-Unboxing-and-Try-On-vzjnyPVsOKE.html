doing really well welcome back to my
best seat of my a South Hall for more
transitional season pieces so one of my
best friends Rebecca she lives in
Chicago and the other day she texts me a
month I pick and see loads of things on
a sauce a chip shop of myself
loads of things that I think you'll
really like so I'm like okay if you put
together a bit of a nation hole for me
I'll give you my card
you can buy it for me etc etc anyway so
everything arrived
I'm not seeing everything everything is
still backed up there's one thing I've
seen I've already seen one thing and I
played about that in a minute
otherwise everything is completed on
date when she's even certainly an email
that lift every products and why she
liked it and why she bought it so it is
probably yeah I really wanted to bring
this view as a bestie does myself also
really enjoyed doing the boyfriend to
make alcohol I'll eat up link on the
screen if you've not seen it but that
was really good fun too
I'm really excited to get the flu here
so let's start off with right number
well it is really exciting this is so
much more fun than me to my own home
right what's on top first thing in the
bag is from Miss Selfridge I brought for
my selfish and so on this is cute this
is very me it's a very kind of Victorian
a ruffle lay that cut out details lovely
ruffles here gorgeous woven patterns
down from in a pretty cream top got this
cumulus see that we can see it
what Ning downs very back that I'm just
must get into it by okay so is it she
said I know it's like your usual Browns
but I love this long-sleeved top when
it's so you are Oh shake did you roll
the eye and give the impression of an
hourglass
depending on what you team it with I
love the neckline if you were to wear
your hair up she is the best really like
that try that on
so this miss something loud yes for me
like it thought made the ruffle feel a
little bit too much that feel--it works
really really well and it's very pretty
lovely color for like nice house girl
like really casual
nice very very cute so good work Rebecca
okay next one this is it Liao's from one
house sure very little fabric very quite
silky actually it's in more of a peachy
Korean tone against that's a ruffling
yard front but not and more sled sleeves
they're nice I really like those
I'll see what she said I love this not
to the bell sleeves but not so big but
you would get them in your food super
simple cut with detailing I want to draw
the I can imagine this with some great
denim or tailored trousers and shelfie
toes I love how much you know made it so
bad I love that okay let's try that this
is actually really cute and line color a
lot it's very sweet peachy cream stand
color and the ruffles are look pretty
after all we look to the cards I'll show
that more kind of pretty if you love its
selfies that I like the most I think at
the computer top we'll just kind of
sleeve for a while
I think it's really nice sort of
structure should I keep it's not only
sure next go wow oh my gosh this is a
gorgeous play suit how pretty look at
that
but such delicate unless a broad runway
fashion of the way this is called
together
is incredible I mean wow it's a kind of
load of things where an amazing bra
underneath like a white bra I may have
to wear cami I mean it's completely
see-through though and in the back is
like this and open so you'd imagine that
a bra would look as good but no maybe a
white band ow good work good work this
is beautiful and goes out to see why
looks your whores carry about this she
said this is the one I'm most unsure off
saying brandis's really pink dress from
last hole but I must clean a lot of
detailing on the top half team's with
Taylor chart so it sits in the petite
section so you may show it to show your
buttock ah a basic let's try that so it
is really actually really sweet and
quite sure you can kind of girl he likes
can't go out and I think you'll love
this it's really really cute and I just
put it over a new bra so you can see it
here at the back
we're not think it's that bad I said
could you have like a white full-band
growl top underneath make it look fine
it's really cute very sweet I think it
was not sure it'll have anything to
really wear it for that's anything for
me as soon as our guys making snakes out
and evenings and more kind of ground
keeps in place ooh nice but you can work
it but maybe it's not quite something
okay next up this is the piece that I
know I was getting Wow this color is
insane this is a suede baggy jacket from
lost cousin Hagen it's incredible it
smells smells like suede this is
absolutely amazing now this jacket the
reason now I have this it's because
Rebecca text me a picture it was like oh
my god this jacket I think you look
amazing in there and this is when it can
sparked off the conversation about the
ocean salt in that text she thought it
said I would give my right arm to this
jacket I absolutely love it I think you
look great in it the other day she told
me excited to actually set up it down so
I thought right I'm going to cheer up so
I actually bought her this jacket as
well and got it sent as a surprise to
Chicago and she got it the other day I
subscribed in that baby who accidentally
sent me something to my address instead
of yours I was like do you like it
and then she birthed ideas what up -
absolutely loves it so that's what I
know of in this jacket so I'm excited so
I thought about that jacket she said
it's a little price fix it's Moffat
cousin Hagen it's such an amazing brand
I love Nate on you in the shade of so
warm beautiful
maybe it's such a versatile cologne you
I can see you wearing this will rescind
your the dress with over knee boots or
contrasting it over more feminine self
portrait dress and heels so write your
look like I would wear it on that
Taylor's jacket and absolutely beautiful
this color is insane it's on the
concessional bloom it's cooling and got
some of the features on it and silver
hardware and it's got this belt goes
around it I think it's absolutely
beautiful
I've actually sent me picture
her hands and she look up the amazing
and I think he's a very very hard jacket
my only worry expensive stuff Alex about
it so I was healed I had a lot of things
already like this like I've already got
a blue suede jacket biker jacket so
maybe I don't really need it but I think
so have you got a little bit I think
it's absolutely beautiful
okay next up we've got a Bock scatter
bucks people let's see what's in here
okay some light all nice elastic to them
they still come through nice high
waisted jeans this is cool at the air
like that with dark cop and the super
skinny you know I really do like a soft
in fact when tomatoes James right now
for my last holes which I really love
with with stress knees they're really
good for and Rebecca I like them because
then it start these look perfect for you
lovely wash with contrast unfinished hem
and a higher rise to elongate the leg
and sculpt your book so these are jeans
I really like them if you're very candid
elasticated
so I'm very comfortable got on some
really easy labor and you fit really
nice and very flattering just like I
love the cops being on darker shade to
know it's kind of accentuates a noticed
and long way I think looks like again oh
nice okay Wow
oh my gosh is this beautiful this is a
scourge promise I mean I say this Sicily
I'll simply well hit that on the box of
songs up like gold specks running
through it and this is a beige cream
shade floaty skirt I don't have anything
like this actual and a husband on the
lookout for skirt like this it's got
like a gold glitter through all of the
fabric - oh my gosh that's so beautiful
I can't wait to try that let's see what
she said you used to love this length of
skirt and this Sicily one is gorgeous
for eating a nude palette and length but
also fluttering on you can see this with
young Vito 2 LB cappuccino and a biker
to contrast it of a simple camera yeah
these go absolutely love I think
Joseph's doing so pretty like even
better I feel
I'm just beautiful and incidentally very
simple body food what oh there's a
really simple policy people are kind of
easy way to wear it with some simple
healthy terms rolling but on the newer
kind of hell walk and girls wearing it
with a roll neck white jumper which
looks beautiful together and ugly
beautiful any kind of jumper on this
just to kind of get that casual nice
very classy feminine style works so well
I'm absolutely love it I really think
it's time fashioning them some of the
ups s now oh shoot this is another cell
sport and push it Miss Selfridge jacket
in a almost lavender gray suede at and
missing it's not suede missing it's
later yes the price it will be this is
actually really really sweet really
sweet I was worried that I have some
things kind of similar to this and yeah
really nice so she said love without
this in the combo between a banquette
any other half of a classic trench
something a little different but not
sure how you'll feel about it literally
if she just like me bought in a
different body I think so
okay I might run up so this jacket like
Rebecca special on the shore it will be
very me off I like it I actually do like
it I think it's got some other features
I think you could wear it multiple ways
after and are over the foul section is a
very soft me outfit very easy everyday
quite cash it's a beautiful color and
really lovely fabric like it feels
really lovely and it has two postures to
pull it in I like it I feel like I've
got a lot of things maybe they're quite
similar so I might keep it that she'll
really really like it I'm a last piece
okay
I forget actually I do not pretend to
know this what's coming because I had
seen it online and I put it on my
website on intercom and she's picked it
up for me
forgot about this this is a jumpsuit
from boss orange this color oh my god
it's a red orange so it's not to the Red
Sox project in between completely that
gorgeous like rich deep orange shade for
jumpsuit with a belted waist and big
wide legs and I really really want to
love this because all for some model
looks insane in this and I've got this
in six I am a feeling I may need before
but it's kind of thinking that it's all
about now and I think Rebecca managed to
get me the very last six on site so okay
let's try it on and see what we say so
this she said love this as soon as I saw
it reminds me of an updated version of
your chambray wide-leg jumpsuit you off
the blogosphere shoes can imagine you
wearing a basket off the top and
contrasting color and your hair up in
fact this could look amazing with that
blue jacket and like many some blue
heels or silver heels love it okay and
doesn't comes in an offset and use
clothing in a hell of a long time this
is absolutely insane and it seems to me
I'm super nice what we go inside for but
I just love it and never really ever
wear this cool button I've got bit more
of a turn on and I'll go and fill and
like a very bright red LED or in this
nude like this move it
so in this beautiful it needs a really
good a good onion but otherwise I think
it's incredible this whole shape it fits
so well belt hook in while eggs are just
oh I love it
by the way this jumper as well I got
from my last new softball I'll leave a
link down below I know of my face makeup

download book depending on when this
