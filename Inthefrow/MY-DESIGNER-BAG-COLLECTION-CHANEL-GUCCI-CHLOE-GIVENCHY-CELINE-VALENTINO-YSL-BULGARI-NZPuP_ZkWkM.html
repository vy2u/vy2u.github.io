if you are brand-new here it's nice to
have you today is going to be my bug
collection video overdue and I'm very
excited about filming this if you're
interested in watching my shoot election
video I very very recently film that and
leave a link just down below or maybe on
the screen maybe I can put it here let's
see this is just look at my kind of
design of my collection you all probably
know I have a lot of different designer
bags so it's not really gonna come as a
surprise I really hope there's no kind
of real negativity around this as I've
seen on other people's bag collection
videos these folks haven't all been
bought at the same time they bought over
a number of years either with my own
money
ask gifts as gifts from brands which
obviously is incredible
but discount codes quite often with
duty-free as well which saves a little
bit of tax which is always nice so yeah
I just like looks your bags looks your
shoes and that's what I decide to spend
my money on so on the same level playing
field here and we can just kind of get
into this so with that disclaimer out of
the way let's get into looking at some
bags and then I kick this off with
luggage and my large bags let's start
off with this bad boy this is the Chanel
jumbo Baba I like a lot of things from
Chanel I'm not the biggest biggest
biggest Chanel bag classer but anyway I
bought this around the time when I was
doing a lot traveling and I wanted and
on the plane bag that was for everything
in and I saw it in Hong Kong and totally
fell in love with it and therefore I
bought it after that it's just great in
terms of having a laptop sleeve case
which is perfect to fit my MacBook Air
about 13 15 13 inch and it's got a large
pocket here for everything else and then
another large pocket at the back plus
some areas where I kind of put my
passport and my phone and it also have a
little pocket at the back which I
generally put my phone in and then get
it lost to them freaking out the airport
where's I found this cuz I put it there
by accident but this is very well loved
now it's probably not quite as clean as
it once was but I have got so much use
out of it and I nups at love it to bits
every time I wear it I get a compliment
from someone it's a huge-ass Chanel bag
it's in canvas for
is countless material and I loved it it
was honestly such a choice another kind
of more luggage piece is the Gucci
backpack by the way I'll leave all links
down below for these because there are
quite a number of bags here and then
honestly I can't quite remember the
names of every single one all you know
is that this is a beautiful Gucci black
backpack full pocket larger pocket of a
suit where you can get everything inside
there it's got little pocket in there
and an area to put your phone nice
canvas
I keep bags in it just kind of fill it
out to keep the shape and then plain on
the back but the thing I love the most
about this is the chain straps I think I
saw this bag actually I'm like Kylie
Genesis to Grandma something shove the
wine read and whilst I don't usually
always follow Kylie Jenner's choices
when it comes to fashion I absolutely
fell in love with this bag and got it at
the airport treaty free so I saved about
300 pounds bag another very well load
backpack is this one from Coach this is
part of the coach and Disney range which
was super exciting I worked with Coach
on a blog post around the whole new
Disney collection which is why I was
kindly gifted this bag totally loved it
I wore it in French it doesn't even look
worn and yet I wore this all the way
around Canada this is my Canada backpack
when I was doing like camping I got a
tent like you would never know
it's literally even look used I can't
see one sign of wear on this bag that's
weird
well it's great yeah Italy not use and
absolutely love this beautiful smooth
leather and make it a little different
another one that's a little larger
is this cute bag from March this is a
bucket bag in its burgundy and some of
the car key Brown striping with some
fringing and again I've still got all
the stuffing in it to keep it nice and
and tricky it's just a black lining I'm
pretty sure I can still buy this if not
you can buy very similar ones from Marsh
a lot of these gorgeous little pocket
bag styles and then I'm a big fan of the
chain straps as well but Sosa bit the
larger bag in my collection right next
to art
luggage but they are larger packs my
collection first being one I've shown to
death now at sushi bar she had to go on
it in the navy blue shade
this is in the textured leather so it
barely ever gets any scratches or
anything on it again this bell looks
that used to be honest and it's very
very well loved
I'll be using it a lot more I think over
the next few months because it's just
that bag that just looks a little bit
more ready for the winter months I feel
in the dark blue shade it's just a
really gorgeous bag and as I always say
it's very robust another large bag of
our collection is this LV Louboutin
Capucine in the gray and brown leather
canvas kind of fabric so yeah this is
almost like a woven canvas cotton fabric
with pieces of leather and seeing as it
is enlarged a white thread I thought I
was going to get a lot more look at this
now again this doesn't even look that
used and I've used this so much like
what's the bottom line
yeah bear looks used at all this was
actually secondhand I got this from
vesti air collective as I was working
with them a little campaign so let me
choose a bag so I chose this one so
again this is very very kindly gifted to
me and it's one of my most prided bags I
absolutely adore this bag
it's just absolutely stunning and it's
generally one of my most used picture
bags I kind of have it ready just to
kind of pick up whenever I'm going out
the house okay going a little bit
smaller but still kind of day where bags
the one I wear the most at the moment is
the D or D or I'm a bag this was a big
purchase I made myself a few months ago
I had been look at this back for so long
ever since it came out I told the fall
in love with it and I was kind of
decided on the right color for me and I
finally stumbled upon this more color
I'm sure it's called burgundy on this
color choice I think it's a bit of a
kind of raspberry meets ox blood and it
called out to me soon as I saw it and
they managed to find we want in this
size which is a medium size which is
perfect for me and with the silver
hardware which is silver as you know is
my color in terms of jewelry choices so
yeah I'm just I'm so happy with it I've
no regrets about this bag it's a very
kind of perche pitch it's quite a
splurge and it's quite a pricey purchase
but I have absolutely no regrets but
it's an extremely classic bags that I
will keep forever another bag that I
bought in duty-free so I got a good
twenty percent off this which is great
this is a Gucci dialysis by
in the Ramsbury floral-print I haven't
seen this now for a while so I'm not
even sure if you can still get it but
I'll try and leave a link down below if
you can I'm so glad I got this in time
though because I absolutely adore it
it's again it's one of my most private
bags I still look at this with absolute
kind of ultra lost it says swoon worthy
it's gorgeous of colors it looks so
elegant and sophisticated and and
although it's quite bright and colorful
I still feel it'd be quite timeless for
me and I'll wear it constantly and
people will always know the season that
this came out it's just so statement
another Gucci is the Gucci maman
bag in the velvet turquoise this has
gold hardware which works perfectly with
the call of this bag actually this
wouldn't look quite and kind of regal if
it wasn't in the gold but the two colors
were beautiful it together I've worn
this so much in it for this season
actually I've got a lot of wear out
there camera doesn't quite show up just
how green this is it's much more kind of
green turquoise you can kind of see it
here actually coming out in the color
but this is make it look more blue but
it's just yet that's what's stunning I
know quite a lot of girls you have this
tomorrow Houseis and Amelia has this and
I think we've all kind of bought it
around the same time when none of us
knew each other had got it it just shows
how much everyone absolutely love this
bag so clear winner next up we have the
lanthorn GG bag in the nude color and I
research this for so long before I got
it because I wasn't sure on what color
to go for and in the end I decided I
don't really have any other nude backs
and this one is just such a cute classic
shape it's got a lot of space in here as
well it's really great it's like an
evening bag or date back and the nude
just means it goes just so many
different times colors so with like all
black outfits this is a really gorgeous
soft bright piece to wear with those
again if you're in cooler like a red
dress or blue dress just something a
little more subtle to wear with those
and the goal just really sets it off
it's really pretty you can either wear
it as a double strap to keep it shorter
or as a long over the shoulder bag I
haven't seen many people with the lamp
energy and quite love it for that museum
because not as many people have it but I
feel it's such a gorgeous classic shade
another bag that a
pretty dear to my heart and absolutely
and or is the saline box back again this
was a bag that I saved up for for a
couple of years and was trying to find
the perfect shade and texture and
believe it or not back when I was trying
to buy this the black textured leather
was nowhere to be seen
I tried in Paris I tried in America I
tried here and no way seem to have it in
Evin kept saying it'll be in stock soon
might be maybe six months and I waited
my turn about after about six months
actually it finally came back in stock
so I'm so pleased and it's just a very
classic very classic piece I mean Celine
in general I feel it's a very elegant
and classic brand anyway but there is
something very simplistic about this
shape that makes it so wearable
something I can hand down and yes to
calm it'll just be that bag that
everyone will still love it's just
really beautiful bag opens with the
clasp and again it's quite got quite a
bit of space in here and he's very good
clean now this leather I've got a lot of
makeup stains inside of here to us got a
little pocket there at the back - and
it's don't regret this purchase in the
slightest
another LV bag this is a Louboutin twist
bag I think I saw Sandra from five-inch
knop who if you haven't seen it before
she is incredible she has the most
amazing blog she had this I think but in
the larger size and I was just so in
love with that she just looks so great
and so classy with it totally fell in
love with it and again this is another
piece that I got from a vest year as I
work with them on a collaboration I just
absolutely adore it's bag again it's
just something so statement about it
about this whole twist lot to make the
LV it's just very clever and keep shape
the EPI leather this is made in means
that it's just very robust and then it's
not thick and non fragile fabric so you
don't really need to worry about
scratching this because it's not ever
gonna really scratch the charts of it
discoloring are very slim unless your
support pen on it or anything but I feel
this is going to kind of stand the test
of time and when you get inside it it's
not got big most space in the world I'll
be honest so close a little mirror in
there it just about fits my iPhone 6
plus you can't go to to teach if we put
it in this way you can't put it in this
and then you can also put a few more
things there so I could fit in keys
couple lipsticks eyeliners things like
that in there but you couldn't really
get a camera in Silas to say that but I
where there's so much for different
events and nights out things like that
here I have the Chloe Hudson bag in the
black suede this is another bag that
I've worn definitely over summer a lot
more because it has a little bit more of
a festival boho bohemian vibe going on
with it with the whole platter divider
that works all the way across the top
and again it just fits a nice little
amount in nothing too much it fits in my
phone just about I've got to kind of put
it again diagonal if that gives you an
idea of kind of sizing but festivals and
nights out and events it's been quite a
good little go to these come in solely
for colors as well there are really
lovely design for Chloe one of my
favorites I think that they don't for
the recent seasons another Chloe bag
this is the Chloe Fay whenever I went a
little bit crazy or the Chloe Fay I kind
of felt like I needed one I wasn't as
keen on a larger version so I went for a
small one and it is super cute and I'm
really enjoying the colors they're
bringing out recently they're bringing
out like baby blues and very kind of
lavenders and things like that and there
aren't really pretty and I've also got
them in backpack versions which are
beautiful but I went there for this wet
in the fey which you could also wear
easily is a nice little clutch there's
something very soft mature about the
shade this tan shade with like a calico
or a beige II kind of cream coat this is
just so he could pop underarm it feels
really nice and quite optimal in the
shade as well and another club and this
is a Chloe Jane messenger bag I believe
this was gifted to me from a brand I was
working with it stalked Chloe quite a
little while ago now actually which is
amazing and this again was a great one
for someone with all colors and again
the kind of more bohemian vibes I think
Chloe definitely went down that very
kind of whimsical ethereal bohemian edge
with their clothing and their backs
which is beautiful not many other
designers did that in such a beautiful
and wearable way something that's my
Chloe was so popular for those last few
seasons Louis's comes on a town chain
with two pockets and it just wants to
fit a lot of things in here actually my
firm fit
easily lengthways which is quite nice
for once and again you can fit quite a
lot of the things in the other pocket so
I did get a lot of use out of this over
summer okay so moving into smaller more
date night evening drags go start off
with the Chanel wallet chain bag in the
dark blue and the herringbone print this
has almost like a little kind of boy bag
feel to it but it's in the wallet chain
shape and it's my phone in here I can
get a lipstick in a key and a credit
card it has little areas to put some
credit cards in here I'm sorry this
really does need to cook clean if I use
this so much it's probably my most used
evening bag actually so many people
often ask like is it really worth buying
the wallet on shame because it's so
small and I would highly highly
recommend it honestly my most used
evening bag it can easily be used as a
cute little clutch and it's also great
to let us travel back as well if you're
going to the airport a lot or just on
your holidays you can just have it slung
of you with your passport in it and a
phone and some money and you can have
got your very essentials just right next
to you I always keep this one it's just
 I mean you wouldn't know we've
had dirty it but as you keep it wrapped
up this one I've mentioned quite a bit
recently it's the Rebecca Minkoff clutch
bag it's just a lovely option really I
wore this a lot on at recent holidays
just a smooth black leather with these
bright colorful tassels just makes it
quite wearable and quite fun and it also
fits in quite a bit inside this big
pocket this is the MCM Patricia bag in
the black smooth leather and the silver
hardware push these in I've got all
these throughout tucked away inside it
also has a cute sort of suede orange
lining can't even see that and it has
got a great structure to this
stuff it keeps its shape really well
because the type of lettuces it's like a
really strong weather keeps up very
small kind of envelope shape really
really nicely this is a very beautiful
bag MCM do a lot of very bright and very
logo heavy bags but they do do some more
understated facts which I absolutely
love the beautiful materials and they're
just a little bit different I find like
Chloe in my collection is a Chloe Dru
bag in the arctic white I think this is
again it was a bag that I looked for for
a while kinda silent color that's often
the thing that puts mouth for long
so it's finding the right color and
finally this came out and I fell for it
so it's the arctic white with the gold
hardware the some reason mine always
seems to come out like this it really
annoys me so I was trying to tuck it in
I try and keep it in my collection like
this so that it kind of stains more but
it never seems to stay lit if I don't
really understand so now and again just
to let it pop out and just where lies
somebody don't mind too much I do often
prefer it I mean that one's fine that
was managed and so wise as well so maybe
I need to kind of like put more pressure
on it I don't know anyway this is such a
great evening bag I've worn it for so
many different events because it goes to
everything again with it being more of a
neutral tone or something very elegant
about a style of bag again it barely
looks used for the fact that it's this
color and I was worried I was going to
ruin it I've not done too badly here so
quite pleased with myself but I feel the
Chloe drew is one of those bags that is
great for people starting to get into
kind of more luxury bag collections or
just wants to buy their first designer
bag I feel it's something you could wear
for so many different occasions even
just going shopping or going out on date
nights or going out for an evening meal
or even on a night out I maybe go for a
black bag if you come for a night out
with it you know you could wear so many
different occasions this is probably one
of my most worn evening bags actually
it's the Anaheim Marsh crushed body
Smyly bag I think shaft and housing
system emblems and logos this is wrong
with a little smile on it you can still
get these now I'm not sure if you get
the silver quite readily but lots of
different colors now anyway but yeah I
think because it's older again it's gone
with so many four types of outfits it'll
be great for this time of year again I
still be wearing this it's my most
metallic bag a half so I think that's
why I still keep on using it the little
YSL logger bag in the black leather with
the black tassel again this is quite
small it doesn't fit my iphone six-plus
but it will fit a camera so I can
Olympus camera for example which is like
my vlogging
small camera would fit in here perfectly
so if I was going out do it for job or
want to chase camera with me I could
just swing this with my shoulder my
camera in it I never good to go
otherwise it's great just fill out your
keys your lipsticks those can smaller
items or an iPhone 6 which fit
absolutely fine in here it's it's nice
on 6 plus doesn't fit but again it's
just some really lovely bag I think
Bulgari is one of my favorite
backgrounds at the mine
anything that make almost looks like
jewelry so this bag and the other backs
it make it almost is like an extension
of a jewelry collection into a more kind
of jewelry accessory if you know what I
mean this change serpent chain strap and
the fastening on the back being so
jeweled and beautiful and elegant this
is when you where they see almost feel
like you're wearing a piece of jewelry
almost it's like quite artistic and it's
very luxurious everything that they're
bringing out right now is just so
stunning and just really elegant the
sophisticated but this is the serpentine
forever bag in the blue sapphire in a
metallic so again it's just a very very
wearable shade of blue and I've been
wearing it so much second-to-last bag
this is the coach dinky bag in the cream
with the Daisy and gold rivet detailing
all over this this is just a very very
wearable bag and they do so many
different colors some don't have the
embellishments on there's like a smooth
leather and I feel again it's a very
easy wearable piece and something that
so many people that are trying to get
into more design the fashion and really
love the design I want to buy the fifth
bag I really feel this is a really good
choice because the gorgeous leathers
they wear really well they're really
cute or a gorgeous shape they don't
really age and I mean especially in this
style it just makes it quite evening
appropriate it is very cute and just a
little bit more affordable than some of
the other bags that I've mentioned as
well so I think it's quite a good kind
of early luxury starter piece really to
get and last but not least is the
Valentino Vava voom clutch bag I have
this in the cream with the gold hardware
and it's a very evening appropriate bag
it's perfect for events any more
sophisticated evening dews I'm going to
and in fact I'm not even taking off this
blue strip because I'm still trying to
keep it really nice with this being more
of a smooth leather I kind of treat this
with the ultimate respect so that I
don't get anything really on it so I'm
trying to keep it in really good
condition quite a lovely good size to
wear Clovis's with two pockets on the
front and then you can kind of hold it
like this as a clutch if you prefer and
tuck in all the straps or you could wear
it as a double strap
every single strap lots of options and
again these come in lots of different
colors and they're just very beautiful
bag I mean this is very kind of iconic
Valentino as well and that is my entire
bag collection I really really hope you
