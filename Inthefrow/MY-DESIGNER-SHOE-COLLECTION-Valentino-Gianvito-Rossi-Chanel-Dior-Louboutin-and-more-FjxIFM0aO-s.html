doing so so well welcome to a very long
overdue video I mean we need to film a
shoe collection for so long I think the
last time I film a shoe collection video
was over a year ago in my old flat and a
lot have changed since then so I'm quite
excited to show you all of my new shoes
before we kick this off I just want to
say two things first thing is you do not
need this many shoes what I'm going to
show you is a selection of my collection
that I absolutely love and I of either
bought myself saved it for either very
gratefully been gifted these pieces from
different stores or brands some I bought
with discount codes it's a big selection
and it's generally due to the fact that
I am a fashion blogger first and
foremost you do not need this many shoes
just put that out there
second of all if you don't like designer
shoes and you're not really into luxury
this might not really be for you this
isn't a bragging video it's just me
showing you guys my shoe collection
because so many of you requested
so without the way let's have a look at
the shoes I'm going to start this off
with boots and as you know I'm a big big
fan of the black ankle boots I buy new
ones every season because I just wear
them to death they go with everything I
love them so it's quite a lot of
different types of boots here because
they're my thing and also for the most
part of this video I'm not going to
mention anything in my other shoe
collection video I'll leave that link
down below but I thought there's no
point we showing you shoes that you've
already seen so this is kind of since
that video what I've bought okay I'm
going to kick this off with a pair of
prada boots these are in a wonderful
kind of smooth leather pointed toe
you'll see a lot of the pointed toe in
this video but really smooth beautiful
leather but I thought these are a very
classic boot but I could wear sort of
during kind of times going in out the
city for meetings and whatnot and then
absolutely beautiful boot the only thing
I would say is that the heel is a little
bit sensitive also got a pair of black
boots from a vs. Saachi again pointed
toe incredible heels these have this
lions head well the sarchie this is low
go to the very back heel with the silver
so the very statement boo
they're just killer heels I always get a
lot of compliments when I wear these
another favorite pair are from dodging
your banner you might recognize these
because they're just so crazy statement
which I absolutely love you have this
embellishment dueling to the very very
back which is what makes such a huge
statement
luckily I've already lost two or three
of the gems I think on these was two on
they're not on there pretty good going
to do where these a lot just absolute
viewed for me I love everything about
doors so I kind of wanted a piece that
would be really wearable for me and
whilst these are quite statement and
have a lot going on I've worn them so
much they're amazing boots the next
repair until of actually a little bit
different I love to in a blue suede and
black suede and this kind of patchwork
almost effect this is by an independent
designer called God Annette Dmitrievich
which I think if I say it she is based
in Paris she has her own soft
independent boutique then she makes her
own shoes and there are absolutely
beautiful as Paris really unique next
are a pair of black leather Cloe boots
with this gold detailing around the heel
so almost looks a bit like a mirrored
effect from the inside these are a
little bit shorter than my other ankle
boots which means that I wear them less
unfortunately because generally jeans
sort of skin the top and I hate having
that gap in between you probably now I
talk about that so much but generally
they are beautiful especially to wear
with like mini dresses that sort of
style for the regards feet of squash I
wore them more than very pointy another
super sexy pair are from all sayings
that Susan have brand-new collection in
All Saints and mix your different types
of leather or smooth leather and a more
patent solid here that moves across
different sections wonderful ankle
length again the great touch with jeans
are a really super pointy toe and
gorgeous sexy heel so I'm big fan of
these a very kind of similar down to my
vs. ones which get up warm loaves so big
fan even more recent pairs my collection
are these from Kurt Geiger which I wore
for Fashion Week
super comfortable very much my statement
style of food with the black suede ankle
boot these are cool as it got these kind
of
Zig panning to the heels as well which
are really adorable but generally just
that very very wearable boot that you
can wear all at the time I'm not going
to take these off I don't think from
Chanel I have a peep toe quilted black
with painted black heel and the Chanel
logo on a pill in this cutout which is
what tracted me to them I thought they
were gorgeous plus obviously peep toe
and Payton rib as well as a toe yeah I
thought these are just such a gorgeous
pair of boots again they're not as high
on the ankles I wish they would be but
they are definitely much more wearable
Chloe's the quilting on these just very
very Chanel so I feel quite statement I
love it a bit next up from Marsh these
are more of a flat pair of boots a
little bit bruton butter now because I
had them in my case of Canada these are
a brown suede with this embellishment
studying all across the front and the
toe
it's a quiet cool statement boots
especially like shorts and skirts for
summer but this is still available now
another pair for March I will leave a
blog post down below linking these with
lots of pictures of me wearing them as
well but these are an over knee boot in
a lovely black suede more of a rounded
almost flat toe at the end fields these
suede all the way down heel as well so
it's completely soft consistent black
throughout and it just goes up into an
over knee boot but these grip really
nice aren't your legs they don't fall
down he's just a great alternative if
you're looking for a really classic
opening boot and my favorite piece in my
boot collection
I definitely at the deal Trianon boots
in the blue and black jacket fabric the
bronze jacquard to the heel and the pink
and white Jack out to the toe and this
detailing with the crisscross white a
sec he's just incredible I love these
boots to bits you can't buy any more
they were so limited edition and sold
out so so fast they were from I'd say
they're from two seasons ago I still
wear these so much I love them and
finally in the boot category we have
Dior these my latest your boots again in
a gorgeous smooth black leather kind of
ankle size I love is it just the inside
gorgeous your patterning here
back in diamante like mini crystals on
Mondays and it also says CD here to the
ringlets and a cute thing about these
that you tie them up in a bow at the
back when you wear them just for next a
little bit of detail I thought it
actually beautiful I love them to bits
they are in stock right now in a duo
boutique okay for the second category I
thought I'd kind of look at heeled boots
kind of strappy heel boot hybrid so
first of all the H&amp;amp;M foul man
collaboration heels I've actually worn
these so much because they're quite
comfortable they look gorgeous I can
wear them with dresses mini dresses
skirts jeans and they just look really
fierce oh really strong and I'm just so
pleased I've actually managed to get the
heath touch and go as to if I would or
not unlikely my friends managed to get
me a pair online she managed to get
through to the website lo and behold and
I got pair and they're amazing the next
pair I absolutely love to bits as it's
one of my favorite brands shall be
Taurasi these are a turquoise gorgeous
suede leather in this lattice cutout
effect I've worn these loads I feel like
I wear these are so different colors and
just create that statement shoe like a
full monochrome outfit with these it's
like how colorful amazing powerful and
actually super-duper comfy as well the
last pair in that category are one of my
newest pairs of shoes and I absolutely
adore them these exact ones from the
Dior runway collection they've made a
few cents in quite similar styles but
this was the exact style that they
showed on catwalk it's just the most
intricate set of letters all in totally
different styles I couldn't even tell
you what these letters are because there
are also differences different here to
here to here to here it's just a very
intricate shoe I mean they're very
unique and they're very different and I
must say they probably one of my hardest
shoes to style but I love them
nonetheless and when I do find kind of
outfits to go with them that I love I'm
just super happy
yeah next up we have mules starting with
a gorgeous pair from Risa I recently
wore in Santorini I should also recently
three months ago time it's passing so
quickly these are so pretty though
they're in a pink dusty rose suede with
this large strap that goes over the
front of the arch of your foot and it's
got like a plastic hey up to these I'm
not sure if you can still get these you
potentially can do I thought they were
gorgeous for kind of summer but me you
could wear them into ashes well quite a
lovely movie think quite a new pair that
I'm absolute in love with are these from
Malone sue yeah in a stunning Navy
Velvets almost purple with this silver
straps across them they're just such a
beautiful shoe and I've had my eye on
this style of shoe from lazuli air for a
year or so and finally it managed to get
my hands out of her and I just love them
to bits a gorgeous jeans dresses and
whenever I wear them we get so many
compliments because it's so unique and
probably my favorite pair of shoes right
now from the whole collection are my new
shoes from Chanel I managed to find
these in Vancouver because it seemed to
be sold out like everywhere right now or
they were at least asking for them and I
got into a bit of a tease you when you
can't find something and you really want
it and it's all out of stock and then
you just want it more kind of that kind
of vibe so I found them in Vancouver try
and mom mean Carly tried to manage was
like babe if you have to get them are so
beautiful so I took a plunging got them
beautiful black heel in fabric the spill
detailing with the seed on there this is
a beige leather and it goes there I'm
going to a fabric probably like a cotton
that reinforce cotton fabric but amazing
my faves
okay next category has to be sandals we
have a pair of some cheese in a red
suede with the classic blue and red
striping and Hospit icon and gold cross
there the gold heel in this textured
plastic I'm assuming that is what they
make quite statement I mean they're not
as easy to wear because the color
choices but again just a for monochrome
outfit or a lovely black dress that's
quite casually cool and these with them
is just my kind of style so I really
love these very very comfortable as well
probably one of my most worn pairs of
shoes are the Valentino rock stood
sandals in the black the multicolored
gemstones a black green
and cream but they're just such a
flattering pair of sandals
I just wanted to death is so comfortable
they obviously don't rub you because
there's nothing really there so strappy
but they're only very short heel as well
so I can wear these with so many outfits
can't even tell you they literally like
my go-to sandal whenever I'm going away
I want to take the fun oh they'll go
with everything
okay next category's more strappy
sandals heels okay I'm starting off with
this pair from Jean Vito Rossi again
huge huge financial Vito Rossi and these
are just beautiful
in a car key deep forest green and they
strap all the way up the leg as well but
they just look so flattering when you're
wearing them on and they're all strapped
up your legs again the short heel makes
them super easy to wear another pair
from zombie to Rossi again that I've got
so much wear out of in a strappy beige
suede gorgeous heel so the super sexy
and flattering on and again it just
wined right up the leg but they're so
flattering and again they go with so
many different outfits because their
color being so easy and wearable next up
is another pet for months oh yeah and
they're a gorgeous statement shoe the
colors in this are so beautiful and it's
just like this very textured fabric run
in between each piece of these more
satins colorful strips really pretty and
then goes into again up the leg in a
strappy style I have a strappy pair from
coach which again I think are still in
stock by the way all the links for
everything here will be listed down
below if everything is still in stock
this is almost a fuchsia pink purple
color it sorts somewhere between a
fuchsia pink and a perfectly lilac and
again strap it all the way up into quite
high heel and then they strap up around
the rest of your uncle as well next pair
our front kick dagger in a gorgeous
metallic gold cutout leather detailing
and again it straps up around rentals I
haven't worn these yet and I cannot wait
these are kind of new season Kurt Geiger
I've just been released and this pair I
wasn't really sure where even to put
these into shoe boots into heels into
strappy heels so I'm going to put them
here and it's a pair
Sergio Rossi white and gold heels very
high heel very strappy cutout work and
this is like a gold metal work - very
very center these are like a leather and
this is I kind of statement gold right
up the arch of your foot but there does
a great kind of white heel I don't have
many of the white heels and sometimes a
dress calls for more of a white feel
sadly the knife on the home run this is
very last category of comps so two pairs
you will have already seen that I'm
going to mention them because they are
seriously circles for me and they are my
patent Louboutin per Galilei P gal I
always say is wrong and then someone
who's French always has a go and I'm not
sure how to say it I'm so sorry do you
kind of butcher the beautiful French
language yeah incredible heels I wear
them a lot hence why they look like that
and another pair of Louboutins which
again you will see before but they're
absolutely incredible how come not
mention them again
granted don't wear these as much because
they're so high they're very
uncomfortable but they look amazing and
a definitely statement shoe for times
when I can bear to wear them for an hour
or so
Knicks repair from dear Francis which I
want to mention can see our actual is so
different in my whole collection this
cow print to the toe again not a pointy
toe this isn't a mesh and this is in a
leather and it straps maybe she'll go in
the strappy one but again it straps up
the ankle as well one of my most prized
accessories and the wanna clue on the
most are my Valentino rock stood heels
so I think I said the ones that were the
most were the sandals and these are
plaits just all side those palpable
shade makes these so wearable with every
type of outfit and they're actually one
of the most comfortable shoes I have
ever ever worn literally could walk from
out of these and not feel I think
another pair of Malone's two years this
time in a Navy suede some very similar
to the Mules the Mules will cut off but
these are also in suede but I've got
these first reel of them and then when
the Mules came out in a velvet I
realized they were actually kind of
they're similar colors but a very very
different shoe for different platforms
as well Jah beaut I'm going to finish
with the last four shoes which are all
jumpy to Rossi the ones that kicked off
my absolute obsession with Sharpie to
rusty other collaborative courts in
white and nude these are so banged up I
am thinking of buying another pair
because it is so dirty these now they're
just they're just worn in but again I've
worn them to death I absolutely adore
these for every occasion I take them
with me pretty much an epic trip except
they'll go with everything
they're honestly one of the best
investment shoes I think you could ever
make if you'd rather go for black I have
the black suede pair which I'm probably
sure I've shown you quite a lot of times
but a really soft suede they're really
comfortable to wear again I can walk so
long jumpy toes I feel really really
comfortable I always buy my exact size
and they're just a classic black
stiletto but it'd look gorgeous
another pair of Calabria courts and
these are in a cream and gold thread
aztec print they were on sale on my
teresa with about 60% off and still have
my size so I had to get them and granted
I have worn them a lot since these were
jeans are so beautiful like black top
black jeans and these are just like
they're just so stunning and love them
to this you can really count how many
times I said the word love in this I
probably go in I myself when I edit this
back and the last pair you'll be glad to
know I know the power jumping to russy's
these again I got in sales like 60% off
which is always amazing when you can
find them in the sale and these are
multicolored black beige brown nude and
cream to the strap and again they're
just really really wearable I've worn a
lot of different events occasions
because it's just that very stretchy
easy looks and all that goes with so
much do to kind of monochrome colors
very comfortable again the only thing
say sometimes it can cut your ankle but
is loose no it's absolutely fine and
again just another pair of amazing jumpy
to Rusty's in my whole collection OMG
we've come to the end of the shoe
collection video this is the reason I
