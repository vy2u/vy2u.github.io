doing so well as always today is gonna
be my dresses my evening dresses
collection so I was just packing my bags
we are traveling to the Maldives and
I've been packing my suitcase now put it
in quite a few of my lovely evening
dresses to wear in the nighttime and I
realized that quite a lot the dresses I
haven't really shown you and also helped
me realize how many beautiful kind of
evening dresses I actually own now
especially over the last few months I've
had quite a lot of events I've been to
either with L'Oreal of premieres or for
you know the amount of people watching
books or having beautiful events and
occasions I need dresses for and I've
kind of accumulated so many beautiful
new dresses so I kind of thought I'd
show them to you most of them are also
available as well so I thought it could
be good for you guys if any of you I've
got prom coming up or a really big
special event or a wedding or anything
like that so I thought it might be quite
useful to quite a lot you guys before we
start though if you are brand new here
it were amazing to have you come back so
please do hit subscribe button for lots
more of this kind of video and now let's
get into the video this one you've
already seen this one is actually from
the Topshop and it's still available
it's gorgeous it's very self portrait
inspired the length of cut out work with
some broderie anglaise detail work over
top of lace and it's a beautiful mixture
of pastels with a deep contrasting black
and also the cream so it's that very
statement dress that is also extremely
wearable very different it's quite
unusual especially for Topshop I
wouldn't have thought this was from
Topshop it's very sort of covering I
feel quite comfortable when I'm wearing
this you'll probably notice in this I
have a lot of interest as a sort of
round high neck which I absolutely do
next up is a dress from Mara Hoffman
which I got from with all this again
it's very different and it's one of the
dresses at my collection that is very
unique is completely different
everything else I own which i think is
probably why I love it so much it's in a
crepe fabric which gives it a little bit
more of an alternative texture to
everything outside also it's a lot of
lace in this collection this is more of
a crepe fabric this goes down into a
maxi length not quite floor length and
it's low-cut around your way
the teal and the stone and the violet
fuchsia and in this bit of lying in a
bit yellow but it's not too in-your-face
and to brush it's gorgeous
you probably knew they were coming up
but this is the first of the
self-portrait dresses I was actually
going to do a self portrait dresses
video because they actually have so many
I thought it would be quite interesting
to show you different ones that I have
but instead I thought now I'll just do a
full evening dresses collection they fit
me really well for my body shape and
they create the kind of designs I really
adore the very flattering very girly
very feminine with the lace work that
they always seem to use so again sternum
lace work it has a nude backing here
that you're completely covered which
goes down to around here and then you've
got these pretty creep ruffles to the
lower hem rode wrong place detailing
again with the lace throughout this
banding this contrast to very waist
cinches you in almost as well and the
short arms cap sleeves make this very
dainty very delicate and extremely
feminine and I have probably worn this
very most out of all of these dresses
now this one is a job sue I thought it
include a few jumpsuits because I almost
see job suits and even dresses in a very
similar way I wear them both
interchangeably and it goes down into
big wide legs and almost palazzo
trousers style clasps around your waist
but then up from the waist it's really
hard to show you this shape but you've
gone scott the bust which goes up into
straps it's almost like a bit of a bra
top that comes around to the back it's
wonderfully flattering it fits me
beautifully I just got the size six in
this because they do fight a lot of
different sizes but the size six and
it's browned usually fits me it is from
a qaq I leave all links for everything
down below as always just in case you
can't find them and you want to go find
them okay next up this is more on the
higher end of the price scale but it's
from a brand that I absolutely aspire
towards I spice wear a lot of their
clothing they're incredibly
inspirational brands the patterns they
use in their clothing always a statement
and distinctive
so this is one of the Peter Pilato
dresses a small repeat patent dated
print the way this is cut in the skirt
means it has lots of drape edge and
texture but then into the center is this
larger floral vining patterning and it's
just very floral very unique it's kind
of thing you could wear to particular
specific events rather than actually
everything I mean things would be a
beautiful wedding guest dress I was a
Fashion Week's you may have seen some
pictures already but I just absolutely
loved it I think it's one of those
pieces I have my water for years and
years to come as that statement piece I
pull out for particularly events another
dress on the higher end of the price
scale again this is from Roxanne de and
I wore it in Paris last week for Paris
Fashion Week and just felt so pretty
dainty in this again it's a stunning
thicker crepe fabric so it has wonderful
drape to it because the thick of fabric
it's not too floaty but it still has
that you know math kind of movement to
the dress and then the back this ruffle
is scalloped detail across the bottom
which adds so much more texture and
again makes it really feminine and very
cutesy pretty and then these statement
collar with the blue of the pink just
has a pop of color there's something a
little bit different to the dress I
think even in autumn I could wear some
tights with this and some little boots
who just look adorable the same way that
in spring or summer I could wear some
little sandals or the stilettos and
dress it up a little bit this is a new
piece to my collection actually and this
is from keepsake so it's a little bit
different to what we sort of have over
here but I really like this collection
again clip so Lacey and I'm just
obsessed with lace with a self-portrait
thing I've got going on and this sort of
reminded me of that again this high
round neck which I adore goes down to a
bit of a shift shape but then works out
into this large flowing textured if
anyone knows the name of this shape
please let me know because I don't think
I actually know it which annoys me but
it's almost like when it's cut in a
square so it hangs with all the points
at different angles can you kind of see
what I'm saying
let me know if you know the name of this
please
we know down the comments I'd love to
find out actually but it's on a nude
backing so again it just looks like
you're wearing a beautiful blue baby
blue almost lavender lacing over the top
of you and it's very pretty i Wallace
last week actually for Fleur seven year
youtube and a very event I love this
dress okay I mentioned this in my
favorites video actually and it's
another self-portrait piece this one
I've worn once so far I cannot wait to
wear it again I'm packing it for the
movies because it's a so pretty
mesh detailing floral repeat
embellishments and goes down into a
gorgeous aqua castle green backing which
really sets off the navy over the top
again some beautiful lace work across
this frills to fabric ruffles it's just
got a bit of everything in terms of
texture when I wore it as well so many
girls there well I know I have this in
my basket I was going to I was gonna buy
it too so I think this is quite a big
hit
this is another new season piece
absolutely adore this again I wore this
last week in Paris it's stunning with
navy blue going down into more of a teal
green blue so it sets off the two colors
lacy short sleeves piping to the
necklines I can fell bitty piping
actually so again it just offsets out a
bit more contrast if you like this but
you're not sure about it being more mini
there is also a maxi in this version as
well but I really like my mini dresses I
love that two pieces
Oh in fact this is the only place ooh
and half in this but I wanted to show
you it because again it's an evening
piece for me stunning new piece from
wreath in a creamy white shade it's not
too bright white so lovely ivory again
lace details with lace on everything but
I just really love wearing this sort of
thing I feel like something they ever go
out fashion too much completely lace
sleeves lace to the waist but again this
is quite a high neck shape as well so
it's just very flattering this dress I
wanted to show because it's from full of
the lemons which i think is another kind
of evening dress essential especially if
you go for something a little bit more
sexy very pretty in the white shirt
you've puli seen this around quite a bit
because we made quite a lot of these
dresses in different
and I went for the white it's very
wedding it's very pretty I mean you
couldn't wear this color to a wedding
but you can get it in one of the
different colors it does come in and
it'll be a perfect wedding swap shake
very romantic again lay floral lace I
Wallis without a bra I mean I don't
exactly have huge boots so I can't do
that but for anyone with large boobs
then I would maybe just get one of those
California brass goes really low and
you'll probably feel a little bit better
but for me I just felt quite quite nice
and helping in this in fact as well
sorry it goes down to a body that's the
difference for this dress come on risk a
wee bit more confident in this dress
it's bit more bold and it kind of does
look like you're entirely naked because
it lets you go down into a body but the
amount of lace it's over it no one's
gonna be able to see a bomb on your
bomber apples are all that going on I
mean I don't feel too self-conscious of
a spell like it's very pretty so I
wanted to show you and last but not
least and this is actually from next I
don't know if you've noticed but next
are currently killing it when it comes
to accessories shoes their new season
pieces like really really brilliant
things
there's something very tropical print
meets oriental this dress especially in
the shape the overall sort of silhouette
is somewhat oriental but then these big
sort of tropical flowers and this also
some birds on here as well it's just a
big mix and it's also velvet so it
couldn't be any more perfect for this
season so yes this is a very different
piece again it's not lacing mm-hmm it's
just pattern then very cute and also
velvet so it's a big big win I think for
the season and it's only 48 pound so for
an evening dress in velvet pretty good
and that's it relieved that I do have a
few more but I just want to kind of
bring it to my favorites my absolute
base and the ones you can still get as
well so like I said everything is linked
down below if you like anything really

never seen anyone do their evening
dresses collections so I hope that you
