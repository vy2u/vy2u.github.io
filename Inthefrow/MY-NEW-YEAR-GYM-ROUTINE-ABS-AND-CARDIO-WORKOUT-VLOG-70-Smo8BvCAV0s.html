the fro 2018 mm-hmm yes New Year's Day
today we got up nice and late
after watching Star Wars on a few drinks
and today is all about like fresh start
me I am excited for this year oh my skin
is now my lord what happened yeah like
three new breakouts since yesterday on
the agenda today I'm not even really
that sure gonna do we might go to the
gym later close can we prancing around
the house a bit but because I don't
worry what make up for the past few days
it's not a little bit makeup on Oh one
very very exciting thing that I haven't
I haven't mentioned too yet as you guys
know I was a L'Oreal a L'Oreal Paris
ambassador and Arsenal L'Oreal Beauty
Scott well I am so excited to announce
that I am once again a L'Oreal Paris
ambassador for 2018 so exciting I mean I
love the team I love the products and
it's something I really love to be
associated with so I hope you're excited
for me too so today I actually want to
try out one of the new loyal products so
the whole point of moving our ambassador
really is to kind of help you guys hear
about new products new for launches the
things I'm loving the most you know
because a lot of you guys probably
follow me because you like what I
recommend and I guess is a an ambassador
in this way it's just a nice way to for
me to kind of talk to you guys on what
I'm enjoying what I'm using all the time
new product launches I think you'll be
interested in because that's the kind of
beauty of being an ambassador really is
that if you have ever any questions
about Laura anything that you want to
know about our new products you can come
to me you can ask me in the comments you
could tweet me you know we're like which
is your favorite foundation out system
in this world or which is groups go out
listen on this one you know and I can
kind of give you recommendations or
things like that which is really really
cool and I like that sort of side of it
yeah so so Laurie I'll just launched a
couple of new products and it's in their
kind of extreme range I've got them all
here
March new macro tattoo your brow artist
pan so it's kind of the kind of things
that will
today on all day I mean how cool this is
tip cause that if it's gonna is a tattoo
long lasting effect and in fact I'm
gonna try and use that today I've also
got the infallible long-wear lip liners
in so many different shades and again
these are just like super long where
they'll really kind of help enhance the
shape and size for the lips and it'll
look lovely and plumped and wonderful I
mean any lip liner does that's why ours
that of the drawing and final involves
got the false lash fiber in their
extreme resist so it's what sweat proof
it's long wearing it's waterproof I
wanted to kind of show it to you guys on
camera because these are like the brand
new products from Mario which you're
pretty girl got so much good I'm pretty
excited about by the way this is so nice
try not this of a deranged it's a full
vegan range actually I believe this is a
rich blue botanical cream it's a very
expensive line of skincare slope and
drying out and I will continue trying
out the next few weeks I can give you
like a good idea of what I feel about it
so like I said because I'm in the house
for the day I want to just spotting a
little bit of makeup and if I did go the
gym then I've only got a little bit on
and also we're gonna go out in little
bit and buy some food so that's what I
thought I'd do I'm just putting a little
bit umm I want it to be quite hydrated
Josie's my favorite the nude mushy
cushion in number seven
cuz I'm still a little bit toned here
once I'm doing this let's just chat
about 2018 yet only yesterday was 2017
like it's not it's not a big change is
it but it's more that people feel like
it allows them the fresh start for a lot
of people they can correct mistakes ooh
maybe before become the person they want
to be in this year it just gives people
that feeling of a restart button which
is nice is that gonna feel like that in
some ways too and well it's last year it
had its difficulties for me I mean if
you were following along with the vlogs
daniel has seen some of those
difficulties especially with my granddad
passing away for that reason last year
wasn't the best but in terms of Korea it
was the last year because it's kind of a
funny one really between being Michael
it was the best year ever
but it's all SIA that my grandma passed
away so
yeah they'll always remember that rather
than the career but still very excited
for what's to come this year I've got a
few things on the agenda which I'll
share as soon as I'm able to but it's
very very exciting really looking
forward to it I'm sorry I just put on
the Dior do your forever
undercover concealers a little bit I'm
not gonna put much else on really just a
tiny bit of something because cheerless
days and just wanna pop em it might make
up just for a bit because you feel like
poop it's not I'm doing today I'm just
gonna put on a little bit of the rms how
I like because I think it's quite nice
sometimes when you've got a little bit
of highlight on at the gym put on the
ants to the sweat look I saw what do you
look that's what you want oh my gosh my
eyebrows I'm gonna have to sort them out
one sec exactly I'm sure that I put the
ease of the day maybe I didn't maybe I
didn't need to get rid of these you know
I've never ever had my eyebrows threaded
or professionally done so that's one
threat laughs that was so fun now just
mean Alex in the house that food was
beyond incredible Alex made I love this
little brush put a little bit of vodka a
bronzy blush on a little bit of color
it's really lovely
I love how like mattified that is oh my
goodness super light natural makeup look
I'm just gonna quickly finish up to
spray I'll keep putting it off the
carpet but hate do my brows is not like
okay that's better
that was actually really brilliant I'm
going to continue using up some mascara
losing my lashes currently so with this
one on one side is the primer which and
I love the fact this primer is also
black I've used privately father away
and I don't really understand why you'd
have a white primer I'll make it a mess
already
so the mascara is double waterproof
apparently guessing that the prime is
waterproof and a natural mascara or the
top it's waterproof but it does mean
that it doesn't smudge it won't flake
it's like smudge proof everything troof
me not already like really kind of
the lengthening and thickening so this
is meant to be feel like a real like
false lash really smudge proof
waterproof look that's the idea
sorry so I'm just going into the second
section so this is the fiber side so
this side contains Offices of the black
can scour product plus lots of little
mini fibers and the fibers will just
quit into lashes making them look
thicker and more volume eyes I mean that
already looks pretty great it does look
a bit like I'm wearing like feather like
like watery
falsies okay that is impressive I was
trapped when Alexander and we thought it
was a good idea actually if I did go to
the gym just to give this a bit of a
like a run through and see what it look
like after I don't really like wearing
much makeup Sergio if I do it's always
used a little bit mascara a bit of lip
liner and a lip balm a little bit of
highlight sometimes but use I don't
really wear them can see how my eye
lashes fair they're nice but usually I
don't bring my camera to the gym boy
thought today seeing us it's like start
the year it could be I don't know he'll
be useful from you guys to see what I'm
sort of doing and what I like to do
because especially this routine that I
do quite a lot I have seen a lot of
changes with it so I know it works for
me maybe it'll work for you so I'll try
an Alex to film a little mister around
the gym
20 minutes open a wallet could run the
agree jump over my black t-shirt on the
way to the gym
and covered in 20 minutes on the chrome
trainer Alex here
now I'm gonna do
yes I think
looking pretty good
and now I'm gonna go on the bike
okay so just come to our little room
meet this me and Alex are in here it's
quite good today actually which is
rhythm in I think it is New Year's Day
I'm going to do kind of show you a few
favorite okay so we'll start off with
moving about 50 or so little for they're
carrying a department you really need to
like press your lower back into the mat
