music through his phone to his ear and I
thinking like you could have it on your
lap and you still get here I can hear it

aloud for other people I just find it
very confusing very confusing so had
before and then think things come
through the first thing from the girl

lipstick this time in a a berry and
that's six or five beautiful so that's
the new Dolce collection well there's
some lovely lovely things out right now
so these of literature to surround the
past two days so that's exciting right
so I'm I'm gonna go get high
oh it's not gonna work I thought that
today I just quickly show you what I've
been putting on my face
it's my this is gonna be like my there's
no makeup makeup routine that I'm doing
right now that's what this is going to
be did in case any of you interested I'm
doing I still got some eyelashes that
I'm not taking them them off but I wash
my face and I've just put on my lumia ND
brightening under-eye cream and then my
ultimate serum and then the recovery
balm moisturizer over the top so my skin
is feeling amazing and I'm just gonna
use now the sheer hydration SPF 40
because now I use retinol every night so
Marceau never I mean you're meant to you
could really wear SPF every single day
even if it's not sunny because it's not
just all about the UV UV a that's the
actual sunlight but this UVB in the
atmosphere so that way or the other way
around
either way you can still you're still
causing damage to your skin just by just
from the light different regardless of
whether it's hot sunlight beaming on
your face it's all about kind of
protecting your skin from the free
radicals and all the different things
are in the atmosphere so always wear an
SPF guys I'm learning this now so go
along you'll have far better skin when
you're older that's less wrinkly if you
do this is where Levite elaborado Beauty
blur has been my go-to since I filmed
for them
for this for their campaign and since
around it's literally become my
lifesaver I apply all over with my hands
it just blends in so easily I have mine
and latte light but there are I think
this five shades five different shades
that hopefully will sue a lot of skin
tones because it isn't meant to be a
foundation you see so it's not that
foundation it's meant to be like an
underlay a real a bit as illumination
and it Prime's and it moisturizes and it
does add some of this illuminating base
I use it really as a as a bit of
coverage as a bit of color is a bit
stamping look at the color how nice it
you can see that a bit of color and also
the illumination it gives her skin is
absolutely beautiful pretty much that is
all I want on my skin right now that
illuminating finish now I am going to be
filming so I'm gonna put on a little bit
probably a little bit more than a half
been for the past week and a half yeah
I'm gonna go in first with the bare
minerals concealers these are the Barrow
concealers that just came out and
they're really really good draw that in
and I'm literally doing this whole
routine these things with just my hands
I really just like in the look of it
I find that my under eyes don't get
anywhere near as caked but I think
that's because I don't have an underlay
I don't have like a foundation layer
underneath it so it means I have less
product going on this area of my face
here that's also very thin anyway not to
put a lot gonna seal around my nose just
puts a half Konstantinos think I have
allergic rhinitis I need to go to the
doctor about it but how am I supposed be
yeah I think I've got a dust allergy I
think that's what it is cuz sometimes I
don't have it like when I'm away and I'm
outside a lot I don't have it but then
what as soon as I get back to my flat I
start sneezing and my nose starts
running and if I do need a little bit
extra coverage just I'm gonna film it so
I'm gonna put a little more on I'm gonna
use an hour
soft creamy concealer just I'm not very
in a bit and an ALICE to it I think the
reason that I feel so secure
- the doing this makeup routine like
this recently it's because my skin is
just so much better than it was and it's
because of these are Lumiere MD products
they're really really working for me
meaning to tell you guys for agent about
it and I said like bullet fifteen weeks
ago fourteen weeks ago I said as soon as
I know what these are actually like I'll
give you all the rundown and and it's
got sup right now - you think only this
for like fifteen fourteen weeks from
youth I haven't broken out since using
it I've only broken out a couple of
times on my chin but they have been
hormonal and I've known why that's
happened that's my own accidental bad
pill taking so that's my fault
but the rest of my skin is so much
softer it's soft its silky its plumped
it's more moisturized and over all the
over my overall complexion looks so much
better which is why I feel now so much
more secure doing a makeup routine is
it's barely that much core Bridget I
usually I would do this and then put
foundation on there's always my Rimmel
cappuccino liner for lips how do you
know I like that and then just blend it
inserts a bit more natural what does
leaves an enhanced shape the lips like
that I am back on my ghulam terracotta
this is in light I've been using I've
been using a hula light from benefit and
loving that I'm quite enjoying terra
cotta at the moment cuz it just feels a
little bit more summery and has a bit
more of a coral tone so I'm just gonna
write on the face a bit a bronzer
there's no cream come to us today
highlight my charlotte tilbury you
tonight wand i'm again just using my
finger then i'm gonna add a little bit
of the rms Luminizer because there's a
different texture and it just a bit more
I only just put it here in it because I
feel like it catches that light so
nicely it's gonna do a tiny tiny bit
more on the ice racing
filament I'm just going to use the
audacity palette and just take about
this Primavera just for a little bit
more shimmery shimmery to my lid but
it's gonna be so minimal just for a
little bit of shimmer yes and I mean I
could use no problem sir but I'm just
going to use a glazier burn orange shade
in here just to go through my crease I'm
feeling so good today it's really happy
me and Alex are amazing works going so
well we've got trips coming up soon
agent really good place that'll do and
then set up shop my my eye my mascara
and use my she pseudo eyelash curlers my
ah she's got a little bit of power on
them I'm still only using the bad girl
bang as well from benefit I haven't had
an LVL in week so I've lost my curl
but this mascara is still it's managing
to hold my curl which is amazing we're
not many mascaras that can do that
any last thing to do it's my eyebrows
this new hourglass arch arch brow
volumizing fiber gel in one that be felt
most I'm just gonna fill my eyebrows a
tiny bit just shake them a tiny bit yeah
that'll do just very very minimal and
then using the fiber brow gel to kind of
fill in the rest and brush it all
upwards there we go I'm gonna quickly do
my lips though but looking for my
lipsticks I found some giant Palmer
violets in my bag we're now just
finished off my lips I'm using Laura
Mercier the law extreme matte lipstick
in ruthless so kind of choking these
almost look not really chalky
I feel like it's not kind of vibe to
them then my favorite is this one
respect which is the nude
and it's like the perfect gray beige
nude put in the middle it dulls down the
pink and so this is kind of like my no
makeup makeup log but we'll a bit more
makeup than other people do so next I
like to film some videos that put a
little bit more on but this is the kind
of vibe with it really once came home
with iGEM vegetables with veggie sweet
mmm from tough girl absolute delicious

dress I would like to leave this dress
on forever please this dress is
beautiful
