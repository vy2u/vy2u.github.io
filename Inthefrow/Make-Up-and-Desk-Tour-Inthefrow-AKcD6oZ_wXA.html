this is going to be my makeup tour this
has been so heavily requested and I just
couldn't film this before because I
didn't have anywhere to actually store
my makeup I had it in a massive jumble
it was a total mess but then recently I
got myself a new desk which I'm going to
be able to show you I absolutely love it
so now I have all my makeup and each the
drawers and on top of the desk and it's
just so much more organized and put
together so I thought this would be the
perfect time to show you my makeup
collection how I store it and where I
store it it sort of put a little
disclaimer in here that I'm not trying
to brag with this and just let you try
to show you my makeup collection how I
store it what my favorite pieces are and
that sort of thing so I really really
hope you enjoy it this is going to be
quite a long video as well so I really
hope you sitting comfortably and let's
get into it so let's start with my desk
this is my brand new desk and had
delivered last week I got this custom
made for me by Taunton wood design and
the made some incredible things so I
found them on Etsy and asked if they
would please make me a desk according to
my specifications all the information
about a desk we found down below the
description bar in case you'd like to
buy one as well but I just absolutely
love it and I think it's definitely
money well spent
okay so drawing the one what we have in
here this is where I keep my blushes my
bronzers and my lip products are these
the kind of products that don't use
often in for the products but this is
where my bushes and bronzer the catch
primarily some that I can show you that
I love absolutely love the new clinic
chewy stick bombs it can apply to cheeks
as cream blushes very beautiful that's
an app to app lots and my current
favorites and there's also the Dior
blush in rosy glow which is quite a
favor but a lot of people it's a very
kind of bright neon almost pink but it's
so soft and pale and flattering
can't really see the voice just really
soft and Peele and pretty and it's got
reactive skin as well so it gives you a
really natural blush on the cheeks my
favorite one though that I use pretty
much every single day
it's a Charlotte Tilbury swirl and pop
blush and this is in first love
absolutely adore this I've used quite a
lot of different makeup routines
recently but it's a really pretty
shimmering light pink flat if you could
pink in the middle
and it's just so natural I absolutely
adore it
bronzers I also have bronzers and then
highlighted and then contour kit so a
favorite contour kit as they'll have
seen it's a Charlotte Tilbury film-star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow which is just absolutely
stunning for contouring if you think a
little bit cheaper for more mathy book I
suppose it's the naked flush palette
that has it wrong is there a cotton
contour bronzer a highlight under a bush
this isn't Street so that's really
pretty as an alternative I've one happen
very very often recently is fish Osito
Osito trio enhancing blush which I use
often as a highlighter front of the
cheeks it's beautiful beautiful and you
can see when they're in my giveaway so I
hope you've been to my giveaway if not
all the information is below it's still
about a week left to enter so make sure
you enter bronzers my favorite bronzers
I was definitely the bronze goddess by
Estee Lauder I have zero one light which
is actually quite a dark shade where I
adore that every single day and looks a
little bit more forward for my price
it's a solar powder from certain glory
that's a fun part now
how many babbling well that's beautiful
all over it's got a little bit the glow
and a bronzer of course now Laguna
bronzer because I know for myself I need
a new one really soon but I don't really
say between the two fees I'd go for I
still order again to buy I'm not there
something even more flawed but a
beautiful honeycomb bronzers not even
started using this one yet but it's
absolutely beautiful that's in the shade
Oh - and it's a supernatural
the not shimmery the lovely matte brown
shade and they're absolutely beautiful
okay that dropped hey this is my middle
drawer I - in this side sharpness
scara's and my pillars yeah I have my
eyebrow products are a few airports I
write pen floors etc here in the middle
I have some primers or I primers
specifically and then all of this around
here is eyeshadows so these are all of
the palettes I own for our shadows any
singular eyeshadows on their own and
then my palettes and things I hope my
actual is in eyeliners - my favorites
definitely these from iko iko eyeliners
my favorite it's definitely liquid metal
because it's off use a pump up action to
put put more ink or product into the
nerve can you see that
so that's absolutely amazing I love this
in this section I've also put my two
Charlotte Tilbury cool chameleons as
well which are actually ice shadows but
I absolutely adore these these I've got
the am behave shade which is beautiful
olive bronze
godly bronze absolutely beautiful and
then I also have dark pearl which again
is a creamy shadow but in a model purple
tone and absolutely fell in love these
and I saw them they are wonderful to
blend out and use apps are the beautiful
so I've got them there their mascara
I've got your show mascara
which I'm trying out at the moment I
mean I kick for waterproof but my phone
my favorite one is by far the Clarins
intense waterproof mascara in terms of
primers my puller my favorite primer is
the Laura Mercier foundation primer
radiant sit disaster for glow to the
face if we put on your makeup but
another one I'd recommend a bit
Porefessional by benefit sample here at
brown products I have a huge love for
browsing benefit Browning's
just got super easy to use with the wax
and the shadow as well that's really
really easy price to use gotcha past few
days and lost that myth that I have been
going back to my Anastasia brow Wiz
pencil I don't know why I kind of bought
this when I was in America don't really
use it much and then recently returned
out again and absolutely loved it
it's just really quite natural wear it
today actually she was on my brows
really fat and I like to finish that off
with the benefit gimme brow wait she
just runs three brows set some all in
play some stuff add a little bit more
color super cute little tiny product but
that's all I need really I love that so
palettes and eyeshadows what do we have
I recently got lorac pro which it was
being the other day you might get ready
with me I'm absolutely in love with it
the shadows and pigments are insane like
this one here this nude it's just they
barely touch it and it's just oh it's
just amazing I love that otherwise for
people over here that can't really get
the rack in the UK the naked palettes
are obviously fantastic this is some
Naked 3 which are not use much but the
collar shades are stunning pink tone
neutrals that's cute
urban decay naked one which are more
warm toned neutrals again just something
in the ever taking tea I've got and I've
also got this spreadsheet on tentative
which is actually really really great
this is the rep makeup revolution
ultra shadows palette I think this has
52 shades and quite a lot of neutrals in
there some maps some shimmers really
recommend actually and then these are
estimate pallets so I'll also talk about
the Tom Ford occupies is absolutely
amazing
pretty pink purple shimmer so I have
that there I also got some Illamasqua in
there Estee Lauder some wild mister
Chanel sparkling Saturn's don't use this
very often actually yeah so that's kind
of it so everything to do the ions
really is in this drawer and finally
draw our number three is here okay so
this is my kind of base and makeup and
skincare so I have all of my skincare
down here and going on the back with my
primers in this bag I have all of my
concealers somehow managed to fit on
there and then I have all of my
foundations here so I have foundations
and then mostly here a few foundations
and mostly BB creams or tinted
moisturizers so let's start with the
skincare I've got my trusty regen cream
in there because I can't live without it
it's absolutely amazing I'm trying out
the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream which
is absolutely beautiful as a base I've
got the others with Ireland skin box and
lotion she's beautiful hand roller on
which I wear pretty much every single
day and if not that I wear theyíve long
intense hydration serum and things that
I love they got a sharp vitamin E face
mess which is an absolute fave just for
kind of brighten up the face a little
bit doing us back into it and doing
pretty worse where the arm release
moisturizer is just absolutely beautiful
I love that as well and I've got a
little pill eyedrops my eyes get really
sore dry eyes that always on the
computer yes and that's sort of skin
care at the moment in reality I've got
some primers so loving this at the
moment the Clarins instant smooth
affecting torch which is beautiful but
then I also have back here I have two
illamasqua products that fail and I've
got the Hydra veil um if you love Primus
and I'm sure you must have heard of
these but they're like core products
real and a skip this is so cool this is
a Hydra Belle this is the sort of jewy
skin if you like Julie skin and kind of
very hydrated look this primer is insane
it looks like this looks got a gel and
use this little spoon I can kind of can
you see that you can come cut it off
it's almost like jello you see that like
jello you can mix it up like that and
then imagine that you put that onto your
face now if we give this a second all of
that now is starting to liquify again
and go back into one for four I'm gonna
give it a leave it here for one second
either the idea being that all that gel
now sort of goes together again and
forms back into this perfect Sheen which
is I thought it doesn't your skin if you
imagine you put that onto your skin it
just gonna leave you with the most
flawless base it's a main thing massive
massive fan of Laura Mercier salt cream
foundation I've got that on today more
special events I always head to this
because I know it's going to be
fantastic
also Madeline love with the other
Massacre skin base moment I have it in
the shade 5.5 that's actually beautiful
one that I know I'm getting exactly what
I need from is the NARS sheer glow
foundation I know it's kind of a cult
favorite now on YouTube but it's
actually amazing if I just quickly want
to quickly apply my makeup before going
out again and I need
something that's going to be perfecting
I reach straight for this guy no it's a
quick if I get except I need em in terms
of soft tinted moisturizers and things
you might know I must've found off the
Elizabeth Arden BB cream I also gloves
as such they L'Oreal magics can beautify
BB cream have that the shade medium wash
I'll show you this now can you see how
Lots set again about to even bring the
brush out after ruin up it's completely
set again into like a it's like a gel
that's a love it I think it's such a
cool idea conceal it is finally my face
definitely include the Mac prep and
prime it's just absolutely amazing
yellow toned I got this in light base
such as yellow toned perfect for putting
them to meet the eyes for brightening
also in love with the Estee Lauder
Double Wear same place for flawless
concealer I have my own shade of to
light more affordable choices is the
wake me up Rimmel wake me up concealer
which is absolutely gorgeous really
brightening and illuminating and a
recent favorite that I've fallen through
the head over heels for is a Clarence
instant concealer this is beautiful like
beautiful to put on it so covering this
shade is 0-1 and it's just perfection
for me so this is my desk space I have
my little mirror from guys from home
base actually I'm at a South Africa
collection the piece is coming this
little sparks I've been keeping things
on there as almost like I'm apt to
protect the top of my new desk then I
have my brushes collection base little
box storage boxes from Muji
it separates into six sections we have
my brushes almost
section down I brushed of the back we
don't really use not going to talk about
that but over here I have a lot of
smaller brushes
things I can't live without the Sigma
e-40 I use that for my concealer the
matte leaves aren't really needed clean
so please excuse here for the Mac to u17
as a fluffy brush blending eyeshadow
same with the zoeva look softer finer
Bobby Brown eye definer brush I use my
eyebrows and I adore it but Lucia I you
see so even it looks sheer cheek brush
because it's just production my canto I
you seem at large contour brush I can't
know what number it is but it's allowed
to come table for highlight i ec contour
brush from Real Techniques but my
highlight bronze there the Real
Techniques powder brush it's the best I
think this is also a favorite like the
looks petit crease brush from zoeva just
for adding eyeshadow into the corners of
your eyes and for foundation application
and I am going between these two
whoopsie
this is the Dior number 11 foundation
brush and this is these are weave a silk
finish brush which is Martha round
fluffy buffing brush
well the bow foundation but depends how
you fit a playmaker whether you first
fry it quite flat or if you prefer to do
more of the buffing motion but they're
both so that brushes and just brought
over my lipstick collection it's
actually on a different table but I've
just brought it over because I thought
it'd be a little bit easy for me to show
you it here so I have this is a little
Muji storage box I'm sure you've seen a
lot of things I just have open services
as well so in here I keep a lot of my
MAC lipsticks as a couple messing
actually from here
think what's out of here brush and read
sort of Hollywood bombshell rex rebel
it's a beautiful dark lip that purpley
lip the Viva Glam nikki is always with a
massive favorites almost sort of neon II
pink
peachy coral beautiful scent you man
very very lightest baby pink then I have
my Illamasqua 's I love Illamasqua
products again there's some missing from
here but we've got some beautiful ones
so T's is a really pretty nude shade
favorites not in here then in here in
the second drawer it sounds a little bit
more of a mess oh there they've gone
right so pitch I adore kitsch and
corrupt a very very similar but they're
absolutely amazing pink shades like for
a really statement pink lip I've got a
lot of the Clarins instant like vectors
and all different colors cuz absolutely
love their the Mac cherry lip liner is
incredible it's just so pigmented to
slice on back breathe and I've also got
night off from that which I wear a lot
if I do a purple lip it's incredible so
it's not got the new Charlotte Tilbury
matte revolutions lipsticks Y style I'm
cramming Giorgio Armani and some of the
new Illamasqua lip glosses as well which
are gorgeous this was in exquisite and
it really is so pretty like a
luminescent pink almost gold running
through it so pretty
