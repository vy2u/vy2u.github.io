fly and now
you
Oh
I
this restaurant it's completely under us
outside in the sea is a key
Oh
so welcome to another beautiful morning
and we're just on my way to yoga so I've
got my usual nectar pond I've got my new
sweaty Betty and so we're just getting
the believe over to be good so this is a
nice shot on the beach as well
this is the area for the breakfast and
it's the best breakfast I've ever seen
in my life
this is like
taystee section
here the gum cake
we're just going looking at one of the
beach course around them where we are
which is water villa this is going to be
like a beach pool villa incredible oh
look at the Hat and as welcome to the
beach
wow it's like an outdoor there's a bath
right in the door outdoor shower and
it's a larger number and then here is
the spectrum see you walk out of there
onto this and I'll see out those are our
water villas just over there but this is
the VA and the beach I literally like it
so deserted he always there he does
yourself just a chill let's just look at
this place so I'm just it's overwhelming
it just how beautiful everything is
nothing I've been anywhere just ask
stunning it's so warm
and now these are the massage villas so
the Israel of different areas we can get
the treatment aqua
I don't want with a lot of batteries but
this element where we have you know who
deal sure this is like an outdoor
relaxation area and calm and you sort of
getting cool I'm out of bed
maybe tuna salad
only the differences
I love
making every soup Jinjiang coconut cream
two marches and
oh yeah
Oh gonna try my
she fitted it making dessert try to fry
it but look let's say so good
so again just like you have money
without money a cigarette whereas this
is like it just got the jet ski just
absolutely be amazing
I like the guy was just constantly being
like come on go faster now try okay okay
I'm trying and trying
so I like concert and like rubbing and
going as fast as I could and it's just
such a cool feeling he's kind of
skimming over the water in sometimes I
see get big waves you can even jump over
like so if you weren't holding on played
probably fall off like for I of the
Muppets
we all see the sea robbing thing I
decide not to do it just because it goes
out to darker blue business ever see and
I have a big
fear of open water you know me well some
even on the jet ski I was freaking out
slightly in my head about but what I was
doing and about the idea of like holding
arm because I fed it on all gone up 11 I
have some sort of panic in the water
about it so I'm just sitting on the
beach is chilling out this is just the
most beautiful white sand the pants at
coral that's been like the way that
sound is creative it's created instead
of by rocks it's created by coral which
means it doesn't get hot which is really
lovely but it's it map beautiful white
Sun and the sun's just going down so the
sunset is just a lot of colors at the
moment in the sky it was beautiful
absolutely golden we've got another
lovely meal to go to and then I'll
probably go for like a midnight dip
tonight in the pool and make the most of
that beautiful pool I've got the
swimsuit is a sauce I'll link it down
below as well as this necklace and
wearing constantly
like a chili - vegetable world now with
a money a chili lime sauce and we also
have reduce our time
and just come back down to the
underwater restaurant again - hey look
at what it's like and now anyway and
it's got some lights that light up so
you can see a little bit
this is the underwater restaurant at
night you see where all the lights I've
looked it off and it's just underneath
there yeah I've just got in from that
meal and run me a bath and put these
petals on the top of it for me it's
probably cold though now no it's
actually still like boiling hot Wow
although this hotel has been absolutely
amazing very excited about seeing what
somewhere else is like the probably the
place to be a bit different so that's
going really really nice then that's
also so beautiful but they're very
different to here
so we're we're last night so just done
that you can just see that color and
that's where the underwater restaurant
this is just down here again
oh wow I mean oh my god
tasty eggs benedict bacon
just arrived at the second island on our
trip and it's just as beautiful as this
one
two kilometers whereas left from Iran
with 24 meters from the edge I chose to
show rather
this is quite a bit thicker oh my God
look at that so far daddy
this is the largest suite that they do
here it's two-bedroom pavilion and it's
absolutely insane this suite also has it
since no show
yeah villa of the moon a little bit
change into this very summery top that I
got from a sauce until I saw shorts I'll
leave links down below by the way to all
outfits of wounds what load of Spanx
gained was beautifully decorated
I've always tell sweets this with me for
champagne then outside check out so my
own ports looking out onto the beach
I've got this beautiful little area here
I think probably one the most amazing
parts of this whole thing is the
bathroom wait for this this is bathroom
it's like Eden the best is absolutely
huge but then it walks out onto this
incredible outdoor shower
it's a club and you go down underwater
again on it's literally right in Biloxi
when you got to get to another so this
is like the underwater bar club
restaurant culture
we just come to restaurant call nest and
it all the trees the tree house
restaurant
count this c-shape cream cheese cucumber
yeah
ring side and then I went ahead and just
lie
move the man
now here with your accordion and a
wonderful yoga morning session with a
really great Indian instructor who was
fantastic and the other day was also
Indian and he was also amazing I think
it's really inspiring and really kind of
slow because it was slower it was really
intense
and are you walking up like 15 minutes
before so now I feel a little bit kind
of faint and so we're just on our way
out now to get some breakfast what I'm
bitten and bitten twice now
spend the day on this island over here
it's so tiny and it's so gorgeous
there's nothing on it
so they brought us over here and we will
come just over this area here and they
set off a beautiful like outdoor lunch
for us with music and everything and it
was so amazing like they really put
their effort into doing it so special
for us I was in snorkeling as well
the start at periculum at jnana
it's a beautiful outdoor it's almost
like a jungle spa beautiful definitely
just bitten really yeah
okay so just got myself ready we're on
our way out now to a run the restaurants
in this resort called tribal and it's
more of an African inspired restaurant
so it's got African staff and they serve
each of African cuisines so I'm very
excited about that my hair is dried from
the sea today so it's kind of feeling a
bit horrible and sort of sea salt spray
I'm trying to kind of work with it
this is called toothfish it's net banana
blueberry so now we are on to breakfast

bicycle to breakfast little Victoria's

why they picked up by like a little tiny
speaker the sentence is gorgeous got to
head across to you now I do
okay so just got to the third hotel
which is in which is Malibu and I didn't
think it could get any better but this
is just as incredible I love the decor
in here this bed looks like Super King
or something ridiculously massive but
then check out the outside again oh my
god I mean you can't swim here though
but down here there's unjust stingrays
chilling in the water steroids and
before they were eels and then you've
got some lounges
when my own private pool which goes into
my bathroom here
so if I walk down here you can walk
along and then you can walk into the
bathroom the bath

shower

room that's on the beach so how
beautiful this is sunset that is insane

beautiful table and the toilets are
