favorites video I'm pretty excited to
film this because if you follow me on my
Instagram which you should do if you
don't already it's at in the fro you
will have seen I was in Japan last week
so I spent 10 days in Japan going around
the cities or night was incredible so
because of that I feel like I've been
away from the camera for a very very
long time so it's nice to be back let's
get stuck right in to favorites it's
quite beauty heavy I'll be honest but
it's been like in quite a lot of new
beauty things the Marion but i'll try to
get through those i'm done to a few
clothing pieces as well so let's get
started it's the first thing i mentioned
speaking of japan are these two products
that were my absolute saviors on the
plane they're back i pop these into my
little plastic bag from the plane and
they just massively helped me to keep my
skin hydrated and refreshed and bright
on the plane as you know when you get on
a flight the air conditioning can really
dry out your skin so it's worthwhile to
kind of take all you make whopper have
no makeup on and just slather your face
in the most amazing moisturizers that
you can find so these two a Berliner
they acquire thermal from Vichy this is
a serum and this is the moisturizer to
go hand in hand wonderful chua really
lightweight really refreshing beautiful
to apply a cabin default them dead
fantastic in a similar style this is
also a massive favorite this month it's
the LMS pro-collagen marine cream I
almost feel as though I might have
mentioned this in my last video if I
didn't really sorry still loving it a
lot this is their 25th anniversary
edition so it's gonna sort of casing and
it also comes with a mirror a big mirror
if you buy it and it's it is pricey its
100-pound to get the set but you'd have
to buy this size I'll seeking very much
smaller size but there's something about
this I absolutely adore it's very much
more for mature women and it helps to
really resurfaces skin and helps with
wrinkles sort of an anti-wrinkle
boosting a radiance boosting and
plumping kind of serum by just really
love the way it feels just got
such a almost gel-cream feeling to it
super lightweight but really just my
skin soaks it up it loves it so I have
this on my desk for whenever I do a
makeup and I always reach for it put
this on first and then carry on with my
routine next up is my favorite perform
at the moment and it's Tom Ford it's
their flirting portofino it's quite a
new one I think this one stunning bottle
as always from Tom fraud yes these are
quite pricey because these are the his
special blend fence so they have the
ordinary sense and yet in the bottle
through around 60 50 pounds these range
from about 100 to 200 pound depending on
the size because they're a sort of a
special bespoke perfume for what they're
in craps incredible like if you've ever
smelt smelliness you haven't blown away
this one I just love there's something
really fresh and aquatic and tropical
paradise beach about it but we'd have a
coconut you smell it's more the kind of
see smell and the Aqua you need to go
into my yourself it's incredible and
I'll also buying their new muah extreme
sent when that comes out you have to
smell what it's so beautiful and it's
soft quite unisex something good by me
and Alex one bottle to share between us
although i knows playing steel at all
still next up concealer i found this one
from tarte the maracuja creaseless
concealer if you've ever used the tarte
amazonian clay this goes hand in hand
with it perfectly so similar in
consistency this is quite thick creamy
consistency it's very similar to the
Kevin a quan skin enhancer it's very
thick it probably could be applied with
moisturizer to really kind of thin it
out and to give it a bit of a thinner
consistency but if you're really looking
for something to cover those under eye
bags look no further it's incredible and
I have this in the shade light medium
sand so it goes with my light needing
some foundation so if you're wondering
about your skin tone I'd go for what you
are in the Amazonian clay if you've
tried that so definite favorite moment
it's amazing got off to do another thing
I've got on today is my lipstick like I
do an application actually might bid on
so this is the mac miley cyrus viva glam
i bought the lady gaga i bought the
nicki minaj so I kind of felt like I had
to and i'm also a big Miley Cyrus fan
anyway so as soon as I saw this this
color I let you too soft picture 1 i'll
buy this and it expect me to love it as
much as I do but I've won a few days in
our consecutively and it's by far my
favorite color this month well it says
this is amplified but it's very kind of
creamy a bit kind of a cream shiny kind
of lip today very creamy used to go on
not too drying obvious it's got a little
bit of a sheen to it nothing too glossy
and nothing to Matt wouldn't fall I love
this color so much and also another tart
product this is the tartlet you'll have
seen this everywhere Doris you've
already seen it a million times but I
needed it so i got it from Sephora
online and shipped it over to the UK
incredible choice of 12 shades ranging
from neutrals through to moes brown
through purples and then deep Browns
Purple's of blacks at the very end so
there's a multitude of different styles
you can create with this it's beautiful
and I usually like shimmers and things
that really glisten on the eyes but I'm
quite liking the fact this is matt and
it's just a little bit of a different
look for me so I really really like that
so yeah big big fan of this at the
moment and the last beauty product i'm
going to mention is something from
shishido I don't think that she pseudo
gets the coverage it really deserves on
youtube because I do make some really
pretty products and you may have seen
this before it's a trio enhancing face
call enhancing trio you can use this as
a blush I can use the highlight eyes
it's a highlight I think it's incredible
I just sort of sweep little bit over my
cheekbones I've got it on today
absolutely
and this brush is also really lovely as
well to apply it with so yeah lovely big
mirror you can use I said use blush or
highlight such beautiful colors and I
found it recently getting my jaw and
realized I should have been using it all
this time so big favor again okay moving
on to clothing the thing up and my brand
new Chloe boot sees with something I
thought I would get so much use out of
this is my most used pair of most new
style of boot ever I always wear heeled
boot pretty much every single day so I
thought why not splash out something
even more beautiful that i will wear
every single day so I went for these and
they're the Chloe boot kind of what the
name is now but they're from Chloe in a
black leather with this gold trim round
the back of the heel and down the sides
the hill like this and a little bit of
gold on the zip too so this is black and
gold just a really easy to wear her
boots that will go with everything and
they're super comfortable as well so
massive fear is mine I just swoon over
this every time talking of shoes I have
another pair and if you follow my blog
in the fro or again if you follow my
instagram or twitter then you may have
seen these beautiful shoes these are
from gina shoes they made them for me
custom mainland for me for the
Cinderella premiere that I went to last
week they wanted to create a glass
slipper obviously it for Cinderella and
this is what they created for me and it
could not be more beautiful they got the
memo about the fact that i love pointy
toes a really thin elegant curb heel and
it just thoughts sweeps around the side
a foot Oh for the sort of the ball you
thought and allow this kind of area to
expose and so sexy and so slick and as
soon as they put them down front of me I
was just like wow like heart I emoji so
these will be available in stores from
august so they made them extremely early
for me for premier there a silver saturn
covered in Swarovski crystal
so that's super special which means they
are around nine hundred and twenty-five
pounds yeah quite pricey but if you are
if you're having a wedding and need a
wedding shoe then this is what I'd be
using if you are going to a wedding a
fancy splashing out or if you just fancy
splashing out on a new pair of the most
incredible shoes you will ever wear then
have a look at Gina because I do so many
stunning shoes that gorgeous server just
feel like a princess when I wear these
next up is a pair of jeans these are
from supertrash I've got these from a
sauce and they're exactly what I've been
looking for if you've noticed recently
I've mind a lot of jeans especially my
last a sauce and boxing I bought so many
pairs of jeans to dry none of them are
quite right for me and I went back on
the hunt and families and finally happy
that I've got exactly what I wanted I
wanted quite a relaxed fit jeans with
rips and distressing that I could turn
up and half as a crop style to wear with
either trainers 12 to our pumps or to
wear with heels because the moment I'm
really into the kind of jeans and heels
look so that's right agent got these
from supertrash these are around 110
pounds but I was at the point of the
search for these jeans I was like these
are perfect I'm just going to pay for
them and I'm in love with them and last
but not least in
my new guitar this is my brand new tiny
Martin guitar as you might go to tell
it's only small as it's about I think
it's like a three quarter size of half
the size of an arduous a Tatar which for
me and my petite body is perfect because
it's none of this kind of reach novo
effect no I just kind of I can sit and
it's just super-easy it's gorgeous I've
played guitar now since I was about 13
or 14 I didn't play it for a long time
wax out in University just cuz i was
busy doing other things also i wanted to
let my nails grow which is girl issues
for you so recently I want to get back
into my older favorite hobby and decided
to get myself a new guitar this is from
a store called music room I'll leave the
links down below do so different guitars
to do music box and all that so gonna
have a look if you're a girl and you're
looking to start playing guitar but you
don't want to get a real large guitar
that coming the whole properly
especially if you're in girl I highly
recommend this size it's such a lovely
light light weight size and it's much
easy to play iphone and the logic task
and that is everything really really
hope you enjoy that of course my other
