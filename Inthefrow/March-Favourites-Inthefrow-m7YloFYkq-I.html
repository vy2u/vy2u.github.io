all do really really well this is gonna
be my March favorites video so it's a
kind of video where I talk through
everything that I've loved for the
previous month in beauty and fashion and
I must admit I've got some really really
good products in there so many things
I've really loved this month newly
discovered and I can't let you wait to
tell you all about them so I'm gonna
make a start with Beauty I'm gonna start
things off with body products first of
all and I haven't discovered something
new for kind of body washing and things
in quite a while
apart from this that I'm really in love
with now the two day moisture shower oil
from sanctuary I've use this a few times
and I'm already totally wowed by it it's
like a shower gel you can kind of put it
onto your shower lily any way you fit to
wash well the thing I really love about
this is that it's more oily in texture
and it's a kind of thing that you can
come from all over you and you feel as
though you're getting this ultra
moisturization this skin feels so much
more hydrated when you come out of the
shower I sort of feel as if I could have
skipped the moisturizing step afterwards
after showering which I always forget to
do anyway so this is kind of like a bit
of a savior for me because it means I
cannot wash smell great and also be much
more hydrated and moisturized all over
so it also smells really really gorgeous
sanctuary doing some incredible products
if you're looking for some new bath and
body products century is definitely my
my favorite when it comes to things like
this the face oh my goodness this is
like one the best discoveries of I don't
know how long six months or something
this is insanely good I mean you guys
know how much I really love elements I
go to the spa constantly it's only Spira
never go to and I use a lot of their
skincare products
and a lot of their bath products as well
anyway they just pour out a bran-new
range which is biotech skin energizing
range it's so brilliant I've kind of
scrapped my whole routine in exchange
for the new biotech products this is the
cleanser and the idea with this is that
it's kind of like energizes your skin in
the morning and it seriously does this
is insane like that you can pump a few
bits on your hand I've been using this
for ages now and you can barely see a
few said
that's how little you need you can pump
a few little bits and your hand and it
just you can rub them together and it
feels this thing you've got double the
amount of product in your hands
Ruba I love your face it just awakens
the skin I use this now in the morning
when I've woken up and before I put on
my makeup when I don't to use anything
like a gel cleanse or anything to clog
ER too heavy and I just want it almost
feel as I've wash my face with the most
hydrating water ever and this is
seriously that it's so brilliant I can't
tell you how much I do this there's also
a night cream and a day cream in the
range and I also use both of them so
it's like I use this then I use a day
cream and at night I also use this and
then on the night cream seriously upset
can't say how much I adore these they're
like totally shaking my routine but this
much product is probably gonna take
maybe three to six months for a bliss to
get through I love it let's talk about
hair products first thing I want to
mention is this from pure ology the
instant deep conditioning mask color
fanatic so it's kind of thing you can
use if you've got colored hair and you
need some really deep replenishing
nourishing help and it's like one of
those kind of instant masks that you put
on in the shower before you condition or
even after you condition if you prefer a
little lather it all over especially all
over the ends all over the ends and I'll
run a little bit through the lengths not
the roots and I'll leave it on for about
three to five minutes wash it off my
head is still super soft and really
beautiful smells gorgeous anything in
the pure ology range for hair washing
and conditioning I am obsessed with
really adore urology is probably one of
my top favorite hair brands it comes
with shampoo and conditioners so this
straightaway fell in love with it it's
really brilliant and I also like the
fact that it's one of those sort of pump
tops so you press it down and it comes
out of the very top so it's sealed
otherwise because I also use a lot of
masks or in tubs and you can get into
them and putting them everywhere and by
the time that you've put them away
you've got loads of water in it from the
shower it's just not a good design
design flaw where is this it's just much
much better so yeah really doing this a
lot I know the hair products as well is
the L'Oreal L vivre extraordinary oil
I've been an advocate for the Moroccan
oil for and
long time many many years now Polly four
years adore it totally adore that but
recently I came to the end of a bottle
and I had a bottle of this resting on
the top of my cabinet and I thought you
know let's give this a go instead and
I'm totally changed over like this is
this is the one now so I use it like the
same as I did before
just a few little bit I can't MP amount
peace into my hands rub it together
and then I rub it all over the ends of
my hair really coating the ends this is
when you've washed your hair before you
dry it by the way this all over the ends
and then I just feel like the ends of my
hair after I dried them just feel much
more nourished and much more hydrated
they just know when there is dry so you
have so many uses for a few weeks and
I'm totally converted moving into
brushes I don't think I've mentioned
brushes in a while but there are three
that are so good right now I have to
mention this one being from Real
Techniques I think they've just brought
out a noose actually I think this could
be a new set but it said don't shadow
brush and I haven't had this one before
but I'm finding it's so good for kind of
all over i applicati newsing it in like
cream shadows especially it's really
good for cream shadows and also in
pallet shadows but let's just when
withing the whole brush and just going
straight in and on the crease all over
the eye and you've literally got
yourself an eye look within like a
minute it's really really good it's a
great quality for such an expensive
chef's brushes
I don't think you can really go wrong
with Real Techniques the next one I'm
really loving is the Sigma tapered
highlighter f-35 I'll leave a link down
below for week 4 finalists in the UK
this is what I've been using for my
highlight and I've got feeling I've seen
someone maybe like Jaclyn hill using a
similar style brush I think that's
probably where I got the idea from to
start using this kind of dome brush to
my highlight but I find it so perfect
you just kind of dip it into your
highlight and you can either sweep it
down this way it creates that perfect of
highlight or just add it onto the very
tip of this and just work it across your
highlights that's what I use basically
because it and it's just kind of the
perfect amount of application so I don't
want a massive brush or else I'm gonna
have huge streaks of highlight I'm just
gonna ridiculous I just like to have
much more precision when I move that
this one I love a lot and the final one
it's a kind of foundation brush that I
absolutely adore
and I've just moved over now to the
morphe and for 3:9 lovely wide large
domed brush I just add my foundations
back my hand to Pat it on and then work
it into the face and it is fine it's
just
flawless coverage with this it's super
soft so it feels really lovely on the
skin and plus because it's so big you
can let's to cover so much of your face
with just a few sweeps so it's just
foolproof super easy beautifully soft I
can't recommend it enough and I'm pretty
sure that there are some fairly
inexpensive for brushes next up I had to
mention the L'Oreal black palette nude
and it's in the rose shades and I'm
pretty sure did I mention this recently
I did I use it recently I think about
them anyway I'm so obsessed with its
what I'm wearing now I've just used a
mixture of can the lightest shade this
is like my favorite inner corner
highlight shade right now this is also
my favorite pre shades and a soft worked
in a bit more of a purpley topi Browns
through the crease and just sort of
built up just checking it such the sill
on there built up this really kind of
lovely deep taupe look and it's oldest
through this palette and this is so
affordable I'm pretty sure it's about
ten pound on a picture up it's so
brilliant and if you want to go for more
kind of deeper tones it's also got some
of those but it is more of a rose shade
range lips and my voice just cracked yes
it's more of a rose shade range which is
right up my street for anything purple
okto or a bit of a rose tone I love and
it's just so affordable honestly I love
this to bits next up this is more in the
luxury category of course this is Tom
Ford I'm pretty sure this is out I'm not
that sure but I put this recently on my
snapchat and so many of you guys went
crazy for it and you're like where can I
get it where I can get it and I'm March
they all got short they sent it me very
very Kyla is a gift and I was literally
stunned when I opened it for a few
different pallets in there and
everything was just so beautiful but
this is what caught my eye and it's so
beautiful it's how to explain how
gorgeous this is I mean
look at this it's huge first of all it's
the kind of thing that's perfect to kind
of carry around when you're traveling or
in your handbag all three sections of
your face are covered in this one pallet
you can Bruns up you can blush or you
can also highlight your face on this one
palette and it's so beautiful
pigmentation like the highlight and how
pretty this is
there's all that quilting effect it's
got on the TF this emboss'd into the
pink it's just ultra luxury obviously
this is going to be one hefty price
product you had to imagine this about 65
to 80 pounds so if you're into your lips
your makeup it's fantastic quality it
looks beautiful it does a job and it's a
great little travel companion so I had
to mention how much I love this
that's all I'm beauty let's move into a
couple of fashion pieces first one's
going to mention these again because few
of you might ask where exactly I got
this from these my favorites all year
round I love them just with my basic
polo neck roll neck body super easy just
in black I also have one in gray it just
goes into my G it's all nice and you
know talks away with a little pop this
underneath in the full body and they're
so affordable I'm in love with them I'll
leave a link down below if you've been
following my Instagram or my recent box
on my blog recently you may have noticed
I've worn this a little bit too much
maybe more than I should really be
wearing it this is a new jacket from
Isabel Marant a 12 so this is kind of
the diffusion line of Isabel Marant and
this I think it's 330 pounds so yes it's
more of a pricey jacket but from the
amount of times I'm gonna be wearing
this I'm gonna get so much use out of it
honestly I know there are a lot of
people out there that are more happy to
spend more money on a jacket because
it's a big statement piece it pulls
every outfit together again because it's
on the outside for your outfit it's kind
of worth spending your money on this is
such gorgeous quality it's not extra
thick but it is of as a thickness
because it's almost like a knitted
woolen fabric it must like a wool cotton
next let's check now it's totally rally
to 62% virgin world 23 percent cotton
yeah so the wall I'll keep it a little
bit warmer I've been loving just wearing
it with the polo neck roll neck it's
like a travel an easy travel jacket but
for this kind of time at the moment when
it's kind of transition into spring and
we're losing the really cold weather but
we still get in little bits of like cold
breezes this is just great throw it on
if you don't want to wear the belt you
can just put it into your pocket and
keep it safe
and kind of wear it a bit more open the
other thing I do have to mention is my
favorite shoe of the moment which I've
been wearing everywhere which is the
Valentino rock stud these are such a
classic shoe and so many of you guys
have mentioned before and be like oh
I've always wanted Valentino's a bit
comfortable I can let you know yes they
are mega comfortable like so comfy I
walked all around Paris in these I have
done so many different events in these
like I did Hong Kong in these literally
so comfortable I think it's because
obviously they're attached around your
ankle and that always makes things more
comfortable and you just feel much more
secure in them so I gave you feel more
comfortable because of that they're not
going to be slipping off your feet this
area covers a good part of your foot so
it's not rubbing on any parts of your
your toes or anything this just hangs
nicely over the front of your foot again
it's not rubbing so there's no real
places for it to rub which is what I
need for my feet because my feet always
get blisters and it's not the biggest
heel in the world it's probably you know
like two and a half inches three inch
heel it's not that much else I can't
recommend these enough if you're looking
for designer shoe I mean they're about
650 pound
they're not cheap but they're so classic
and you will wear them about everything
that you go to for the rest of your life
I can assure you I have not taken these
off since I got them I have these in the
powder color if you're wondering there
are so many different color shades mine
are powder and I just wanted some things
that would go with everything so it was
a bit a bit nude but not entirely new
there is more of a new shade than this
but I saw this and thought no these are
really perfect for me some went for
these so I'll leave a link down below
and I'll leave a link down below as well
the jacket and also this in fact
everything will be linked down below and
