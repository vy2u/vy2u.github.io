favorites video it is the end of May
somehow summer is already sort of dawned
upon us already it's just gone so
fastest here already so we're nearly
into June so this is gonna be my
favorites of the previous month as I do
everything the month is just a rundown
of my favorite products of the previous
month in terms of fashion I'll be honest
I haven't really been out shopping much
which is really unlike me I especially
love going online and buying new things
each month one or two new things just
kind of spruce up my wardrobe but I've
not really been purchasing much I do
have one or two things I guess first
things probably just sis cam so like a
really simple vest
just to throw on with a pair of jeans
like I've got a cool pair of a sauce
they're almost a bit like a mom Jean but
I think they call the more relaxed
fetching only the links down below
anyway but something like they said are
really cool cool in a really cool Grima
it's just really easy to throw on some
really enjoying wearing this from
Topshop in terms of shoes you will have
seen these if you follow me on Instagram
if you don't already follow me I am at
in the throw on Instagram come over and
follow they see everything else that I'm
loving for the month anyway but these
are some shoes that I've got my
Instagram a lot of you went crazy for
them I'm crazy for them I think they're
awesome such a cool statement shoe I
wore them with some shorts and blades
out on holiday in Ibiza and they just
added that edge a little bit of stop
drama to the outfit it's really really
cool
the lovely nude suede these are from
Carmela I didn't realize that they do
actually zip up the back so you can sit
your legs in super easily but I just to
be honest just put my leg straight
through and then just pulled the laces
tighter and tied them up otherwise a
beautiful beautiful shoe very much
statement for the summer and in Asti
it's the only other two things to show
you for fashion our bikinis if you like
to watch a lot of bloggers and youtubers
as
look instruction bloggers and also blogs
from bloggers you'll have seen triangle
bikinis everywhere but I recently got a
new one think this is which one is this
I'll leave down below the exact name of
it but I really love the color of these
so they're lilac on the bum and then
lilac down center and then this aqua
turquoise the mint green more a mint
green on the sides that go into the top
I mean it's just really flatter in the
shape of super flattering if you're
worried about sizes I would say I mean
I've got these in a size small and I'm
usually around a size 6 top and 6 bottom
so I would say if you want to have a
little bit more room at the top a little
bit more room in the bottom so that you
don't get that kind of double bomb
effect where you kind of it's so tight
that part see bombers kind of sticking
out everywhere I'd go for the small
especially these I mean that's a small I
mean look how small they are so I would
say go for smaller bottom as if you're
about size 6 if you're a size for size 2
I've made this side down but if you're
sorry 6 in the UK I'd maybe go for the
small and also I have not yet worn this
I am so excited I've tried it on but
I've not worn this out yet and I'm
hopefully gonna be taking it away with
me this weekend to Barcelona and it's a
beautiful bikini from Melissa odor brush
and i got this from simply beach think
that's right again i'll leave a link
down below if we can go get it but it's
the most beautiful fabric it is my
almost a committed fabric effect all
over and then it's just in this easy
regular triangle shape top what the
fabric is so like assurance and
beautiful obviously this is more money a
triangle bikini and the triangle bikinis
pull around 50 pounds so it depends how
much you wanted to spend but this is
just super luxurious if you're going on
an amazing holiday and you want to look
the farm
then I'd go for this I cannot wait to
wear it the next thing I'm going to
mention is my Olympus PEN now I know
that I've mentioned this before in a
favorites video but the more and more
and more been using it the marks been
totally falling in love with it if you
read my blog in the fro com of course
then you'll probably seen a lot of my
outfit shots which i've shot with this
camera so I used to take out this camera
the Canon 70d with me when me now and
Cisco for date nights are good for date
nights and I'd take all my pictures on
that however when I got this and when I
got the 45 millimeter lens
one-point-eight they completely changed
everything I did this is amazing it's
got the most incredible depth of field
and could be stood in front of lots of
buildings awesome soft situation and
Alex can take my picture and everything
in the background will be so beautifully
blurred and a bit really sharp and all
the colours will be beautiful this lens
suit totally change the way I feel about
this camera I mean I looked it before
with the kit lens but the kit lens is
nowhere near as good as this lens so if
you're thinking about buying a new
camera and you're a blogger and you've
got a bit more money to spend or if
you're just very much into photography
and would like to go away traveling and
you want something a little bit smaller
what's still incredible this is a camera
I highly recommend it's got a flip
screen as well so if you're a vlogger or
if you like to take selfies it's easy
enough and of course it looks gorgeous
in this white leather style and also
recently a friend of mine Juliet from
style of nylon I'll leave her link down
below because her blog is gorgeous she'd
go see it but she has done a
collaboration Olympus which is
incredible and she has given me one of
these straps to go with my camera
because it before it has had a black
strap but she said that if you buy them
from John Lewis at the moment I think
you might get the strap free with it
which is awesome graduations to Julia
for working on such an awesome collab
with Olympus and awesome for us if you
want to go and buy the camera so massive
thing this month I absolutely adore this
camera now and I'm also just going to
speed this up because I don't want to
beat this to be too long to be honest
but beauty products what I've had been
loving first up the Clinique Pinkpop
cheek pop blush
absolutely love the shade it's beautiful
color it goes on so easily with your
fingers or with a brush and a Caesar
brush brush onto my cheeks and it's
beautiful I can't tell you how much I
love this shade for spring/summer
obviously so much it's gorgeous
next up is the mac prolongwear
foundation i bought this in the day in
the airport on my way to Ibiza I've
accidentally brought in the shade
slightly too dark for me because I was
head to toe town I'm still a bit tongue
there but I was really tempted when I
was on the way to ip6 I've done twice so
I look really Brown so I went for NC 35
now I should have gone for an NC 30 I
think so I think I might buy another one
and NC 25 and the man makes two together
to get the perfect shade the reason I do
that is because this is actually
brilliant I've got it on today mixed
with the Illamasqua skin base which is
another favorite this month because
these two together are dream come true
they make my skin look so flawless and
so perfected I absolutely love them
together but even this on its own and
this is a waterproof foundation so if
you're going on holiday somewhere this
is your baby
honestly this will be so good for making
sure that if you jump in the pool you so
got a bit of coverage on of course
there's no SPF in it that's the only
thing so make sure you're also wearing
SPF as well but in terms of foundation
these two at the moment are my face next
up to set all my foundation and all of
my face in general is the captive on D
Lock and Load makeup setting mist I
picked this up from Sephora online you
got it shipped over I've got a few other
things as well and it cost me about 15
pounds shipping watching which included
a customs charge too
so 15 pound I thought was pretty
reasonable to get it over it smells like
cucumber it's really fresh really really
great every time I do my makeup now I'll
spray my face with this and just
it's just it's just wonderful it's just
a little spritz
I just really refreshes your face
especially if you've come home from a
day at work and you got to go out again
later spritz this over your face it's
kind of sponge sponge of your face and
it'll just refresh to make okay next up
is a product that has not been in my
collection ever before and I don't know
why and I mentioned it in my new beauty
in video and it's a Mary Lou tsubame
Luminizer and of course it's going to be
a favorite this month because it's
insanely fantastic it's so bright as I
mentioned in the new window video it's
like light shimmery gold but even just
the smallest amount on a brush onto the
skin um and I've got some unknown if you
can see in this lighting this all but I
just work it in with the Real Techniques
contour brush over the top of my
cheekbones and it just glistens
incredibly it is fantastic this is kind
of the only highlighter I'm going to
recently that's how good it is last two
I promise first up being my new favorite
mascara which is the Lancome doll eyes
mascara in black I have whittled on so
many times about the Clarins truly
waterproof mascara and how much I adored
it and this has soon that's become a new
favorite as well so only those two
mascaras are the things that I use but
this one the moment it's the one I'm
going to it's got triangular shaped cone
wand so it's super easy to apply it's
the eye lashes but it holds the curl
fantastically and that's all I want in a
mascara just kind of thickens my lashes
and holds a curl all day what more can I
ask for as a woman and this does the
trick wouldn't if like make sure you get
the waterproof version forget this
because obviously few different types
this is the doll eyes waterproof and it
is insane it's so good and last but not
least oh by the way but I do have that
on my
she's right now but last but not least
it's a new map lipstick and this is real
doll never seen it before
I think it's new forgive me if it isn't
oh I saw it in a new little collection
of lipsticks I had and this straightaway
reminded me of the Lady Gaga Viva Glam a
little bit darker than some Jim man
I'll say Tremaine however you say it and
it's a little bit darker than say Queen
Cup in terms of being more pink but it
as soon as I saw it it reminded me of
the Viva Glam
Lady gaga and that was one of my
favorite lipsticks for so long and then
they discontinued it so as soon as I saw
this I picked it up and I went straight
to the counter it's wonderful again got
it on right now
it's just a very light baby pink nothing
too brash quite neutral not too bright
it's just at that beautiful Sheen to
lips so I love this amazing amazing
corset sometimes when you're wearing
this so much I think that's everything
again for this month I hope you liked
these favorites it's time I feel like I
really love these favorites so
everything I've mentioned here I have a
massive massive love for this month and
the things that I've been using for a
couple of weeks and really really been
enjoying so hopefully you've taken some
move from this video whether it's a new
lipstick or it's a pair of feels you
want to buy then perfect I hope you're
all doing really really well and you're
really excited for summer I have so many
trips coming up so I'm really just
hoping I can get lots of videos out to
you and good time hopefully it'll all be
good but I've got so many trips coming
up and I'm gonna be so busy I just I'm a
little bit scared of whether or not
gonna be able to get all my usual
Wednesday and Sunday videos out if you
didn't realize I always post Wednesdays
