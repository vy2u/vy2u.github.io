favorites video it is the end of may
somehow summer is already it sort of
dawned upon us already it's just gone so
fast is here already so we're nearly
into June so this is going to be my
favorites of the previous month as I do
everything the month is just a rundown
of my favorite products or the previous
month in terms of fashion I'll be honest
I haven't really been out shopping much
which is really like me I especially
love going online and buying new things
each month one or two new things just
kind of spruce up my wardrobe but I'm
not really been purchasing much I do
have one or two things I guess first
things probably just this cam so like a
really simple vest just to throw on with
a pair of jeans like I've got a cool
pair of a sauce they're almost a bit
like a mom Jean but i think they call
them are relaxed fit jean I'll leave
links down below anyway but something
like this in a really cool cool in a
really cool grey marl it's just really
easy to throw on some really enjoying
where this from Topshop in terms of
shoes you will see these if you
following on Instagram if you don't
already follow me I am at in the throw
on Instagram come over and follow they
see everything else that I'm loving for
the months anyway but these are some
shoes that i put my instagram a lot of
you went crazy for them I'm crazy for
them I think they're awesome such cool
statement shoe I wore them with some
shorts and blazer on holiday in I visa
and they just added that edge a little
bit of sort of drama to the outfit it's
really really cool the lovely nude suede
these are from carvela I didn't realize
that they do actually zip up the back so
you can sit your legs in super easily
but I just to be honest just put my legs
straight through and then just pulled
the laces tighter and tied them up
otherwise a beautiful beautiful shoe
very much statement for the summer and
in our st it's the only other two things
to show you for fashion our bikinis if
you like to watch a lot of bloggers and
youtubers as
look at Instagram from bloggers and also
blogs from bloggers you'll have seen
triangle bikinis everywhere but i
recently got a new one think this is
which one is this I'll leave down below
the exact name of it but I really love
the color of these so they're like on
the bum and then lie like down center
and then this aqua turquoise the mint
green or a mint green on the side that
go into the top I mean it's just really
flattering the shape super flattering if
you're worried about sizes I would say I
mean I've got these in a size small and
I'm usually around a size six top and a
sixth bottom so i would say if you want
to have a little bit more room in the
top a little bit more room in the bottom
so that you don't get that kind of
double bond effect or you kind of it's
so tight that part c bombers can
sticking out everywhere I'd go for the
small especially these I mean that's a
small I mean look how small they are so
I would say go for the small buttons if
you're about size six if you are size
for size two I've made this side down
but if you're sorry 6 in the UK add
maybe over the smalls and also i have
not yet worn this i am so excited i must
have tried it on but I've not worn this
out yet and I'm hopefully going to be
taking it away with me this weekend to
Barcelona and it's a beautiful bikini
from melissa odabash and i got this from
simply beach think that's right again
i'll leave the link down below we can go
get it but it's the most beautiful
fabric it's my almost a committed fabric
effect all over and then it's just in
this easy regular triangle-shaped top
what the fabric is so like sharee asst
and beautiful also this is more money
from a triangle bikini and the triangle
bikinis pull around 50 pounds so it
depends how much you wanted to spend but
this is just super luxurious if you're
going on an amazing holiday and you want
to look the farm
then I'd go for this I cannot wait to
wear it the next thing I'm going to
mention is my olympus pen now I know
that I've mentioned this before in a
favorites video but the more and more
and more than using it the Mars been
totally falling in love with it if you
read my blog in the fro com of course
then you'll probably seen a lot of my
alpha shots which I've shot with this
camera so I used to take out this camera
the canon 70d with me when I mean out
Cisco for date nights are good for date
night and I'd take all my pictures on
that however when I got this and when I
got the 45 millimeter lens 1.8 it
completely changed everything I did this
is amazing it's got the most incredible
depth of field and can be stored in
front of lots of buildings are awesome
soft situation and islets can take my
picture and everything in the background
will be so beautifully blurred now
they're really sharp and all the colors
will be beautiful this lends a suit
totally change the way I feel about
camera I mean I looked it before with
the kit lens but the kit lens is nowhere
near as good as this one so if you're
thinking about buying a new camera and
you're a blogger and you've got a bit
more money to spend or if you're just
very much enjoy photography and would
like to go away traveling and you want
something a little bit smaller but still
incredible this is a camera i highly
recommend it's got a flip screen as well
so if you're a blogger or if you like to
take selfies it's easy enough and of
course it looks gorgeous in this white
leather style and also recently a friend
of mine Juliet from style of nylon I'll
leave her link down below because her
blog is gorgeous should go and see it
but she has done a collaboration Olympus
which is incredible and she has given me
one of these straps to go with my camera
because it before it's had a black strap
but she said that if you buy them from
john lewis at the moment I think you
might get the strap free with it which
is awesome graduations to Julia for
working on such an awesome collab with
olympus and awesome for us if you want
to go and buy the camera so massive
thickness month i absolutely adore this
camera now and I'm also just going to
speed this up because I don't want to
beat this to be too long to be honest
but beauty products what had been loving
first up the Clinique pinkpop cheeks pop
blush absolutely love the shade it's
beautiful color it go
I'm so easily with your fingers all with
a brush and a caesar brush brush onto my
cheeks and it's beautiful I can't tell
you how much I love the shade for spring
the summer obviously so much gorgeous
next up is the mac pro longwear
foundation i bought this is a day in the
airport on the way to write be sir I've
accidentally bought it the shade
slightly too dark for me because I was
head to tote and I'm still a bit tongue
now but I was really tempted when I was
on the way to our be fix I've town twice
so I looked really real so I went for NC
35 now I should have gone for an NC 30 i
think so i think i might buy another one
in NC 25 and the main mix two together
to get the perfect shade the reason i'll
do that is because this is actually
brilliant i've got it on today mixed
with the illamasqua skin base which is
another favorite this month because
these two together our dream come true
they make my skin look so flawless and
so perfected i absolutely love them
together but even this on its own this
is a waterproof foundation so if you're
going away on holiday somewhere this is
your baby on a slip this will be so good
for making sure that you could jump in
the pool you still got a bit of coverage
on of course there's no SPF in it that's
the only thing so make sure you're also
wearing SPF as well but in terms of
foundation these two at the moment are
my face next up to set all my foundation
and old my face in general if the kat
von d lock and load makeup setting
missed i picked this up from sephora
online you got it shipped over I've got
a few other things as well it cost me
about 15 pounds shifting watching which
included a customs charge too so 15
pound thought was pretty reasonable to
get it over and it smells like cucumber
it's really fresh really really great
every time we do my makeup now I'll
spread my face with this and just
it's just it's just wonderful it's just
a little spritz I just really refreshes
your face especially if you've come home
from a day at work and you got to go out
again later sprit to serve your face
kind of sponge sponge of your face and
it'll just refresh to make up again next
up is a product that has not been in my
collection ever before and I don't know
why and I mentioned it in my new beauty
in video and it's a Mary Lou the barn
Luminizer and of course it's going to be
a favorite this month because it's
insanely fantastic it's so bright as I
mentioned in the new wind booty video
it's like light shimmery gold but even
just the smallest amount on a brush onto
the skin and I've got someone now if you
can see in this lighting this all but I
just work it in with the Real Techniques
contour brush over the top of my
cheekbones and it just glistens
incredibly it is fantastic this is kind
of the only highlighter i'm going to
recently that's how good it is last two
I promise first up being my new favorite
mascara which is the Lankan doll eyes
mascara in black I have whittled on so
many times about the clarins truly
waterproof mascara and how much I adored
it and this has soon that's become a new
favorite as well so only those two
mascaras are the things that I need but
this one the moment it's a 1 i'm going
to it's got triangular shaped cone wand
so it's super easy to appliance the
eyelashes but it holds a curl
fantastically and that's all I want in a
mascara just something kind of thickens
my lashes and hold to curl all day what
more can I ask for as a woman and this
does the trick wonderfully make sure you
get the waterproof version forget this
because office a few different types
this is the doll eyes waterproof and it
is insane it's so good and last but not
least oh by the way that I do have that
on my own
she's right now but last but not least
is a new matte lipstick and this is real
doll never seen it before I think its
new forgive me citizen well I saw a new
little collection of lipsticks I had and
this straight away remind me of the lady
gaga Viva Glam a little bit darker than
some gym man aww st. Germain however you
say it or assigns my time to mine isn't
it yeah and it's a little bit darker
than say cream cup in turn to be more
pink but it as soon as I saw it it
reminded me of the Viva Glam lady gaga
and that was one of my favorite
lipsticks for so long and then they
discontinued it so as soon as i saw this
i picked it up and I went straight to
the counter it's wonderful again got it
on right now top or just think it's just
a very light baby pink nothing too brash
quite neutral not too bright it's just
as that beautiful Sheen to list so i
love this amazing amazing courses summit
i'm gonna wearing this so much I think
that's everything again for this month I
hope you like these favorites it's time
I feel like I really love these
favorites so everything I've mentioned
here I have a massive massive love for
this month and the things I've been
using for a couple of weeks and really
really been enjoying so hopefully you've
taken to move from this video whether
it's a new lipstick or it's a pair of
heels you want to buy then perfect I
hope you're all doing really really well

have so many trips coming up so I'm
really just hoping i can get lots of
