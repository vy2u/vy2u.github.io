favorites video I can't really tell you
just how excited I am to be sat here
creating a video for you guys actually
sat filming in the UK it feels really
really nice and I know that I've kind of
really not managed to do many of these
kind of videos recently and I really do
apologize I've just been here there and
everywhere doing all these trips trying
to create lots of really beautiful
content for the blog and obviously for
vlogs then I do also look creating these
videos for you I favorites videos and
all these kind of sit down videos so
I've really truly missed it so it's so
nice to be sat down anyway stop the
babbling I'll get into the video
as always this is my favorites of the
month I didn't manage to film an April
favorites so this is gonna be an April
and May favorites all combined into one
so it should be even more amazing things
I really really loved and of the kind of
usual way I do it I'm gonna start off
with Beauty I'm gonna start off a tulip
colors I am just absolute in the woods
right now I feature them on my Instagram
and snapchat and so many of you are
always like what are you wearing and
quite often it's some of the Anastasia
Beverly Hills liquid lips my favorite
probably being crush which is this so
much a little bit more pinky in tone and
this one is pure Hollywood which is a
little bit lighter more nudie but these
are just kind of like that perfect matte
liquid lip I don't find them to be too
drying on my lips I usually self apply a
balm I'll apply a lip liner first and
then I'll go up with these and even if I
do draw over my lip liner with these I
just find that it kind of gives you kind
of a barrier and almost a line to follow
just taking out a really perfect lip
shape and absolutely adore these shades
my name is very much a nude lip girl and
why I need lip again today this by the
way is a new SJ edit lip Collett in
sunday sunday bear oh I'll leave a link
down below yeah so these two are the
kind of liquid lips I've been wearing
constantly though in fact I've just
ordered some new Kylie lip kit so money
last night somehow I managed to get some
kind of lip kit so I'll let you know how
I get on with those as well soon but for
now these two I love next up is a
perform and this is the Elie Saab rose
Couture lift
which is Instagram for Victoria which is
so beautiful they took me away to can
which may have seen in my recent vlog
and also my blog and it was all about
this kind of new perfumers couture and
it's seriously my summer scent now I
absolutely adore it it's kind of it's
more of a mature scent than what I
usually go for it still has all those
kind of rosy fruity vibes very girly
calorie - with something in between like
a Chanel number 5 and a Dior and
something a bit more fruity and girly I
guess something not quite as kind of
mature and old-school Chanel but it's
just so beautiful apps that love it and
I love how they kind of create all the
bottles to look a bit like prisms and
the cash to light every when the light
bounces off them it's very pretty
next up is some hair care I've been
really into this has hair on it which
you do you just got it's at my shower
it's the new red Ken hi-rise volume
lifting shampoo and lifting conditioner
bigger smell really really beautiful
they just give you that a little bit
more kind of pump in your hair after you
washed it after you drive it and it's
really like with Ken products I've read
kind of Urology if my hair I kind of
like my winners I have hair that's kind
of it's quite thick but then also quite
thin it's like that very kind of medium
it's really hard to explain I always go
to hairdressers and we always try to
paint on the bleach whatever and they
always end up going back getting more
product because I didn't realize just
how much hair I have so I've kind of got
a lot of hair but it's almost like it
doesn't look like it so I like a lot of
volume and I like my hair to look quite
so big and I mean this hair pull the
knees a bit of a wash now I had it done
the other day
and I've had it curly I might've just
kind of like for this film and out like
no leave it I'll leave it quite kind of
chilled
yeah I dunno well mark and say a part
I'm really enjoying using these so just
kind of thicken up my hair volumizing a
little bit making them super clean make
them smell nice I'm just finding they're
really really great and I've been using
that with the pure ology is the deep
conditioning mask I'm pretty sure I've
mentioned it before but I'm still really
loving it this is kind of what I
desperately need for my treated bleached
hair so if you also have to each hair
you need in something a little bit more
kind of a bit of a stronger more
conditioning
ask if they go to I've kind of
rediscovered the ghulam midnight secret
late-night recovery treatment this is
just one of those kind of treatment
moisturizing creams for the evening that
really boost the skin this as well is
amazing for traveling I shouldn't take
this inside my traveling light travel on
luggage stick it inside there because
it's only you know 30 mil sorry 30
minutes you can get away with it a
little travel bag and I take off my
makeup and I put this on and my skin is
so much better after I get off the
flight I've been using so much more so
recent kind of long flights and my skin
it hasn't really taken it to all of my
skin thankfully so it's all done to this
it's just really moisturizing seriously
hydrating and it just almost perfect the
skin in the morning I wake up my skin
looks plumper firmer it looks more
hydrated it just looks much more
beautiful and perfected so it really is
a midnight secret it's a really great
moisturizer a little blush duo I've been
loving is from Kevin a Kwan it's the
creamy flow duo improv Ella and chanel
this is like a nudey pink and this has a
little bit more pink to it but I've been
using this brush you see the Real
Techniques 205 a contour brush it comes
in like a little set from Real
Techniques and I was just been whizzing
it over at the top of hair cuz this is
like a cream blush and then literally
just and then just whipping it up to my
cheeks really softly and this pretty
glowing creamy natural flush to the
cheeks it's really with the pretty it's
my kind of show you I kind of moody pink
nothing too brash and it just looks very
very natural because it is creamy and
because it just sink into the skin these
together match made in heaven
honestly abs in love these concealer I
have mentioned before I think bare
minimums bare skin and I'm still using
it so much in fact every single day
every single time doing makeup I'm using
this concealer it's much better for me
and then ask and sealer it's better than
the urban decay concealer it just has so
much product in it it just kind of packs
on the product so honest little wand
just really draw in all the product
isn't drying with a sponge can Real
Techniques sponge or am a Beauty Blender
it just passed away and just as this
really brightened illuminate it
concealed area it's so good honestly
like as soon as I found this cuz like
this is the one for me I'm not sure what
shade this is I'm pretty sure this might
read Oh fair it's not shoe fair and I've
also got a light on as well which I also
use but honestly it's so brilliant I
cannot recommend this more just gonna
give a shout out once again to my
favorite foundation especially in that
kind of luxury categories it's the
Joshua my maestro glow it is just my one
only I use it every single day if you
want to know a lot more about this I've
just done a blog post on it as well
which I'll leave a link down below to
should like to read a bit more about it
but yeah I just want to mention it as my
definite favorite of the past over six
months especially in the kind of luxury
categories this is the one highlighter
so the anteater starlight illuminator
made its way back into my eyesight I
cleared away so many highlighters and
bronzers and bushes I flayed out my
entire drawer just we could try and find
some more products again that I really
loved and that is when I found this bad
boy hiding away at the back of my drawer
and I forgot just how much I loved it it
is wonderful it's like a very bright new
being kind of candle light whitish
champagne shade but it has kind of
speckles of gold it's kind of like
champagne which makes it a little bit
more gold it's just extremely
brightening extremely bright now I've
got it on today actually so if you want
to do what my highlight is today that is
it oh you can see it there boom yeah is
seriously beautiful its present on just
in case you can see it's gorgeous it
blends beautiful into skin it's
extremely pigmented it isn't so full so
you kind of need to use a little bit
kind of sparingly and build up if you
like to it's just a really great
highlighter I think oh my goodness okay
out of this entire thing a place so this
is my favorite favorite product of this
entire favorite and it's the Bobbi Brown
I barely ever talk about Bobbi Brown but
I found this it's long-wear cream shadow
stick in taupe
and if anything I wants it was a to
apostates are brown it's more of a tan
brown it's a kind of brown that if you
waste your brush into your bronzer and
put it over your eyes like an eyeshadow
it would kind of give this effect but
this is a cream and I'll put on today in
fact I'm gone today but it's one of
those super easy shadows that I used it
in a recent video my get ready with me
in the Santorini I use this hey sue but
you think you just draw it on the lid
then I'll take a brush and I'll whizz it
through the crease and over everywhere
and it just diffuses it and it just kind
of pulls everything out and that's it
one look done one eye look done in one
little simple pen it is so wonderful in
fact perfect brown shade that's just
about every single day you could wear
even for nights out you could stick a
little bit of a glitch the top coat over
it it look beautiful
on this thing cannot recommend this more
it's become like my one and only in fact
a few so much of this our idea how much
have I got left with that and I've got
much Oh what do I do with it Oh
excellent
okay that's good have you quite a bit
maybe get quite a lot of product
excellent and to finish off I'm going to
mention a few fashion products the first
stop being this pair of Chloe sandals
when I saw these online I love them and
I thought they looked super comfy but I
didn't know how much I'd look them until
I got them so a lot of them trying the
bouncy very luxe on my feet and I adore
them these are the most comfortable
sandals I probably ever bought just
because they're open toe so not get
anything rubbing your toes they're also
slingbacks you not got anything rubbing
this part here when your heel that
always seems to rub on every single pair
of shoes and they just sort of lace up I
laced them I sort of tie them at the
front like this and I tie them around
the back of my ankle and it'll bow
they're just very very cute the kind of
forgot the light of the fact they've got
the suede they've got the slingback it
kind of like incorporates a lot of
trends into one little shoe but they're
kind of it I feel like they're a shoe
that have been kind of overlooked and
not seeing many people with these and
they're just honestly might my summer go
to now I'm so in love with them upon
them so much already
so Santorini I took them to Dallas I've
just been taking these around with me
everywhere I love them to bits such a
great summer shoe next up I had to
mention
bag it's the Gucci I want to say the
dying on this dialysis bag is that right
like it's the shape you'll have seen a
lot of people have but not as many
people have this color I saw it
months ago plus right five months ago
totally fell in love with the color and
the whole kind of shape and the floral
pattern and Reliance I've got nothing
like this it's such a statement back and
this whole kind of like snake splash
it's kind of very kind of medieval
there's like lions like lions head that
come around this kind of snake style it
was just so cool I just have so loved it
and it's big chunky silver strap there's
just something very unusual about this
like you Chi the Caesar it's just doing
the most amazing things I'm obsessed
with everything they're doing but I
wanted to invest in one thing and this
is what I am precedent yes I had to
mention it definitely my favorite bag
off this month and to finish this video
you've probably been waiting for this
product to come up but I have to mention
it because I have worn it to death in
fact definitely a little bit sick of
seeing me in this jacket now that I'm
actually put off wear and get a little
bit through it for a week or so at least
it's this jacket it's the bow man laser
in black the double-breasted blazer
effect there's beautiful Kenneth lapels
and also there's very structured in fat
- and habit on this panel here because
it's gonna shape it badly it's got the
very structured shoulder as well it's
incredible it's just something you can
wear with everything with your going out
with your going to a date whether it's
daytime you wear it with jeans or a
little like white tea with some
slingback shoes or know some sandals
it's just such a jacket everywhere and
with everything and then on three looked
a bit it's a very pricy jacket which a
lot of you probably point out so it's
very much investment piece that big time
and that's one piece I realize this and
you can probably get dupes on the high
street so if I can find any Jews I'll
try and leave some down low for you but
of any of you guys who love investing
and love your kind of designer pieces I
thought I'd mention it because I
honestly loved it too bit so yeah have
to mention it and those are my favorite
products of the past two months there
would have been a lot more on this list
but I want to whittle it down to kind of
my very very very phase
and can I give you loads of different
things so lipstick perfume foundation no
can't give me a big round of the
favorite so I really really hope you've
enjoyed it guys let me know if you did
leave me a comment down below let me
know if you're happy to see me being sat
back down again doing these kind of
videos for you and make sure you give
the video a like as always I hopefully
will back soon with lots more on these
kind of videos for you in fact

really well and I will see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
