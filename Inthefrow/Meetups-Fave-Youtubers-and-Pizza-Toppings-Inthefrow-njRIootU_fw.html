isn't asked in the fro video you may
have noticed that past videos have been
called ask Victoria decided just to
change it up a little bit and they can
ask in the throat just so there was
extreme clarification of which Victoria
it was going to be so that was going to
be me
so I thought it would be asking the
throat from now on I hope that's okay so
many of you have asked me questions I
asked on Twitter at in the throw of
questions and I also asked on instagram
up in the fro for questions as well so
make sure to follow me on both of those
or Twitter and Instagram just so you
don't miss out on the next video
I used on there especially to go across
to Twitter and ask me some questions so
I'll answer those now okay Molly asks
highlight of 2015 so far that definitely
has to be going to Florida with Alex and
quite a few of the youtubers you might
have seen my Florida vlog if not I'll
link it down below what that week was
just incredible
unless Hogan asks what are your top
three Springs from that beauty
essentials ooh I would say it would have
to be an amazing tinted moisturizer for
the stage we don't know we have
something heavy I would recommend either
the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer the
NARS tinted moisturizer or the Elizabeth
Arden tinted moisturizer by far my
finger free and not to recommend a
really good waterproof mascara for those
days when you may want to go in the pool
if you're on holiday off those days
where it's a little bit warmer and you
want to make sure you're gonna have
something it stays on your eyelashes
without any sweats or heat to making
your eyelashes suddenly become part of
your under eyes so for me the best one
would have to be as you know Clarins
waterproof or Lancome Delibes Hypnose
waterproof well there are so many
waterproof mascara in the market just
have a look around find your favorite
and
would be an amazing lip balm to make
sure that you keep your lips really
moisturized especially in the hot
weather and this one my all-time
favorite bomb is two by Terry Baume De
Rose lip balm in the pink shade I think
it's at the rose pink not sure about
leave a link down below at least lumber
asks what are the top three tips of
fashion blogging oh and I would say top
three tips would be get yourself a
camera that can take some pretty amazing
for pictures of you that can really show
your outfits in good details that the
colors are correct do something that
makes you look like new rather than dog
down version of that some cameras can
make you look Apache look for really
really dull depending on the lighting
and also say to make sure that you wear
fashions that really suit you and that
you really love don't just wear
different fashion styles because you
think another blog is wearing them and
they look good so you're gonna try that
make sure that it really really suits
you
and I'd also say be consistent with your
posting so if you want to be a fashion
blogger I need to make sure that you're
posting once or a few days once a week
at least just to make sure that your
followers can come back and actually see
regular content if you're posting less
than that it's quite difficult for
anyone to sort of find your content
regularly and for more of a relationship
and a loyalty to your blogger guess so
if he asks what do you miss the most
about the thing in the north the thing
I've really missed the most would be it
will be my best friend Rebecca who still
lives up north and I would also say
chroma which is one of my favorite
restaurants in Manchester really I mean
in this back I wish I could kind of just
walk out with my flat like I used to and
walk straight over to there whenever I
wanted to
Heather chambers asks how did you
balance studying for PhD and maintaining
your blog I'm about to do doctorate for
three years any tips in Asti
the balance is quite difficult it was a
hard few months I didn't have much
social life I didn't have much sleep and
I was extremely stressed in all honesty
it was difficult especially towards the
end when I was really writing up and
finishing it off during the actual PhD
the first two years it was quite a good
way of having a hobby alongside it so it
was easy to balance it at first then it
became quite difficult when the kind of
pressure hit alia asks if you could be
any Disney character which one would you
be and why I would say Ariel from The
Little Mermaid
just because Prince Eric is by far the
best-looking Prince out of all of the
Disney movies and she also looks
absolutely beautiful Samar asks favorite
song at the moment if you follow me on
snapchat app in the fro course I'm
literally in the fro on every single
social media channel so go have a look
but if you've been following my snapchat
drama if you've been following my
snapchat you'll know that I have just
been singing your link to one song in
particular over and over again on my
snapchat and that is cartel faster ride
and it's incredible it is my white eye
noise it's my summer song for definite
so go have a listen if you want
something really cheer you up and
something you can really sort of dance
along to I love it okay so a Liam
Blundell and hey Ali Ali asks so you're
ordering a Domino's talk me through it
hold up this question okay first thing
would probably that I put down the phone
and pick up the phone to Pizza Hut in
all honesty much for a Pizza Hut cheesy
bites pizza for pizza
although if I was ordering the Domino's
I would hope that they by now do a
cheesy stuff across to the do cheesy
stuff across now they're never used to
that's not gay if they do cheesy stuff
crossed oh my god
good I hate it anyway back to work
okay so Ally what we talked about um
pizza okay so I'd ordered cheesy stuff
cross Pete so first of all I'd order
extra mozzarella a lot of tuna black
olives potentially onions and also
rocket it was my face mainly for peace
hook cheese bites Abby asks anything of
doing and meet up any time soon yes
definitely I do want to do Meetup I'm
not sure where yeah I'm not sure how
what time but there definitely will be a
me to put some pranks there's so many of
you I'd love to meet you know now I'll
let you know when there's a time a
perfect time to kind of do a meet-up he
will be the first to know
oh I like this question this is kind of
uh sort of deep and meaningful questions
sometimes you ask yourself when you're
alone serene asks hey Victoria if your
house is burning it every person was
safe what three things would you save
okay yeah first thing I would say you
could be my hard drive because it has
all of my photos on it and videos and
work from the past 11 years or so I
think so that that's what I'd say first
next thing I'd save would be on my phone
because then you can bring people you
can tell them what's happened literally
probably pick up my handbag throw my
phone in it throw my keys we need two
keys but everything else in there that
could do it about makeup I might run to
my Burberry jacket and put that on there
just so I've got back with me priorities
Ella asks what age did you start wearing
makeup and advice now Oh interesting
questions no I think I was probably
about 11 or 12 actually starting high
school may about 12 maybe second year
started doing a little bit of makeup it
was mainly black and coal and a bit
mascara as I remember and I was also
obsessed with lip glosses and soap with
some really bright stupidly pink lip
glosses I remember then over the years
just got more and more and more and as
for advice now not too sure what you
mean by that whether you mean what
advice would you give to someone that's
younger I'd probably say if I might say
fast advising myself back then and I
didn't think it's a big problem to be
honest I think that girls at that age if
you're if you're watching you are 11 12
13 you for sampling you want to
experiment with makeup then why not if
you laugh too in school obviously don't
go overboard play around with little
bits of makeup that make you look really
natural am i enhance a few features like
their eyes means a bit a little bit of
mascara or maybe just a little bit of
lip tint fair enough
right this pug 13 asks who is your
favorite youtuber I would definitely say
at the moment Jaclyn hill is my absolute
favorite
I think her personality is so uplifting
bubbly and I absolutely adore watching
her videos with Jaclyn Hills video as
soon as I see them I'm like yeah
watching that right now anything which
talks about that she loves
I just want in my collection too and
she's absolutely gorgeous so big
recommendation couldn't watch Jacqueline
Hill already you should Hannah asks
which do you prefer Starbucks or Costa
and what you usually buy easy definitely
going to be Costa I prefer most of their
drinks in there actually and most things
that I buy would be peach lemonade in
there or strawberry lemonade and
Christmas anything will have been
the gingerbread lattes and sticky toffee
lattes are incredible Ella again asks

much sometimes I don't think it's that I
say how much how much I love you guys
and how much I appreciate everything
that you guys do especially in terms of
the support you give me I mean recently
