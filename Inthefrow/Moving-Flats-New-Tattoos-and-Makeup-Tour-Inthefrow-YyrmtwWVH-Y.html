you're all doing really really well this
today is going to be my moving day vlog
I asked you all on Twitter do you really
want to see this and so many of you said
yes so I thought I kind of bring you
along with me for the whole moving day
process unfortunately I'm on my own
today Alex had already booked in a
tattoo at the Brighton tattoo convention
today here I had stopped booked it paid
for it so there's no way he could really
get out of it when we had to kind of
move on this day so that's a bit crap
and I have to move on my own it's all
good independent woman behind all that
so I've got some removals men coming
over in about half an hour to an hour
that I hope so just going to do
everything and make it really really
easy that I've got to go get the keys
and then we'll move into the new place
this is currently what we're dealing
with boxes and bags of everything and
then that isn't even half of it it's all
stacked down and on the way I think Alex
liked the idea that they could kind of
get to it quicker but we'll see and then
we've got all of our pictures but then
we also have the furniture so my huge
chest of drawers from Ikea my smaller
one again for my Kia but my desk which I
had custom made for me by Taunton would
design I'll leave links down below well
why is a flat is pretty much ready to go
these are my current desk makeup drawers
which is just insane I think it is like
a makeup tall on this while back and
it's probably like doubled since then
like foundations primers concealers my
line is from scara's loads of our
shadows and types of single eyeshadows
brow products and bronzers contour kits
blushes highlighters and that's not even
counting that
the eyeshadow palettes I have in here
the Lark I like to stack top so we're
moving not too far actually we're moving
like 10 15 minutes away kind of West
London
you've looking a little bit worse for
wear now these were really lovely gifted
today from bloomin wild this is for a
collaboration that are doing with
refinery29
so it comes through your door through
the letterbox
such a nice idea alway complete just
going to tackle this now okay so that
took about two hours to load the van and
then we kind of separated they've gone
their separate ways I went to get the
keys and I've beaten them here somehow I
got to know where the guys are and like
I really hope they don't go away with my
stuff it'll be fun and yes we're just
moved in
so yeah new landlords have just left a
really sweet little gift moving in Presi
we're nearly there with you unloading
there is so much almost there
final removals - gum it took nine hours
and I was like here's a tip you really
really deserve it like they've worked
their bombs off I'm so thankful because
there's so much stuff in here it's just
a bit insane and I didn't hear now I
have to unpack with it here but it would
be amazing it's not be amazing this job
I wish I had more food in as well I
really want some food all I pretty much
have is champagne or pasta so sounds
good to me
okay update what time - now 7 o'clock
I'm getting there
again that Alex isn't quite home me I'm
sure I'll pie be home in about half an
hour and hopefully there's some sort of
beer and pizza
haha I don't need any pizza technically
but I would love some right now ok a few
more hours at passed now and alex is
finally home he's been getting statu
like I said can I show them oh look how
Mays nice looks incredible Joey needs a
good wash but it's insane so we thought
we'd order so we've got some fish and
chips OMG and clapping scam key oh my
gosh that looks so good okay good
morning it's the next day and we've had
an okay sleep more on that we had like a
big arrow bed like a big king-size
blow-up bed that we use when we have
guests over so we slept on that last
night because we're getting our new bed
deliver today so we need to be in links
for that we're just gonna nip out and
get a coffee and some food at me we need
to buy a kettle because I'm getting a
Smeg fridge/freezer in the blue I
realize I didn't get the kettle so I
need to go by the kettle today to match
it and we also need a TV we're gonna go
get a TV and I get put on a bit of a
mission today trying to find a TV in the
capital not many had much luck however
we have just found Whole Foods I know so
many people like white I just never been
here because
this possible on there where we select
where's now there is oh my god I'm so
upset

our new mattress as well
alex is eating the peanut butter is it
good it's amazing how this peanut butter
in Whole Foods if anyone should just get
a little peanuts and you and you want do
what you call it grind them up again
yourself so there's absolutely nothing
