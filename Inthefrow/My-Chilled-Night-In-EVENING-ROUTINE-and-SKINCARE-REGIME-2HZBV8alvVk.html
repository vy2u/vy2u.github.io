it comes might you turn 18 some days
when I come in from work at 5 o'clock
other days and they have been in my
office until like 6:30 7:00
definition of work no two days are the
same I thought I will generally go into
the bedroom and make sure it's all nice
and tidy Philomena like scratch to get
in bed at night I just like a really
relaxing bedroom so in the morning I
probably throw my clothes everywhere the
probably all over the bed and leave put
it away so I'll hang everything up tidy
things away into drawers pipes and back
my bags and just make the bed make
everything look really lovely and
inviting for later on then I'll head
into lounge and again I like to make it
look super cozy and just really really
chilled to light all of my candles I
have so many I realize the Mark Hopkins
spice kind of flavors it was my face and
if I happen out of the day I do like to
come back and do all of my emails if I
can't then we head out and we get some
food we nice often had Sainsbury's get
loads of bits and bobs and then head
back and also with my brand new box of
flowers from arena flowers I've got like
a subscription where I get flowers every
two weeks
it's really nice to have fresh flowers
like deliver straight to door so you
have to think about it and they're
really really pretty
then it's on to making food I'll be
honest Alex also cooks a lot but tonight
is my turn and I'm making a vegan curry
so a plant-based curry will is coriander
coconut broccoli sweet potato carrots I
leave all of the recipe down below just
in case and if you like to make it super
tasty and really perfected this recipe
now it's so so good if you're enjoying
kind of more plant-based food
adding that into my balls with some
brown rice some poppy Downes and also my
homemade mango chutney sauce which is
pretty much this mango but it's super
delicious and how's nothing out for it
and then we'll sit in my chair and watch
our favorite show which is a moment is
the Americans you have to watch it so
good then we're on to my skincare
routine and this is my favorite and
today taking off all of my makeup
we've got after the Garnier micellar oil
infused water to take away any of my
waterproof mascara or just anything on
my face
generally it is so good a really good
look
into the LMS biotech cleanser it's just
really lightweight I've been using this
now for like a year
it's fantastic to accept in a way and
after I use that with a hot class to
make sure all the makeup does come
straight off my face
love doing that then I'm really into my
toning as well so I've got the new
Nippon fab glycolic fix night pads and
like to tone my face now as I was
familiar underneath my eyes and I felt
like I needed something to fit really
exfoliate it's not taking away any other
residue and then I go in with another
more hydrating toner which just kind of
helps to level everything out balance
everything out a little bit more and
make sure my face isn't too dry then
just brushing my teeth with my electric
toothbrush leave all details down below
some car gate toothpaste which is my
fave I'm just making my teeth ugly there
I'm just putting on my super sexy shower
cap don't even see me look this sexy
before in my life so the end of heading
into the bedroom my favorite time of day
by far is when I can put on my skincare
I love it and it goes crazy because it
takes me so long but I have so many
products that I love to apply so it's
not showing you exactly what I've been
using LG's eye drops just because I work
so much ink with computers and mobile
phones I like to make sure my eyes am
nice to be hydrated and then into the
search at Medina recovery so just really
love like one directory with a bit of
hyaluronic acid in there so just helps
to add a little bit more moisture to my
under eyes I'm talking with moisture see
dr. Dennis knows hyaluronic moisture
cushion is my new favorite nighttime
moisturizer it's just really lightweight
it's a very kind of cushiony bouncy it
just really sinks in beautifully so my
lashes I always use a mousse well lash
and brow
serum as I get my lashes lifted with lvl
sources make sure they love it in
conditioned after my lips I use the de
la matte super lips otherwise I'll use
comics at once the time I love using
this as well I like to add a little bit
of product onto my neck and this Lascar
so use one one one skin serum for this
and I'm really loving using this man
it's called serum at the moment as well
as that all over my nails and it's
really rub that in so all my cuticles is
bitten on my stroke due to how many
times forget shellac this really helps
and then to finish the dermal own
geranium and one that hand cream is my
current save and it's just really nice
soft and moisturizing for my hands
you'll make the best we get in the bed
will often watch like that Netflix again
have a little bit of a chance on the end
of the game and then it's like oh thank
you so much watching guys hope you
enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
