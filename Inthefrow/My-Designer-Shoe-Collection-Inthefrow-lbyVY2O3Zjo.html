see you how you all doing this as you've
seen from title is going to be my
designer shoe collection video quite a
lot of you have requested this video in
the past I do have quite a few pairs of
shoes and recently I fought or one or
two more pairs in the mall kind of
designer categories I want to put a
disclaimer in here right this moment
really this isn't a bragging video this
is just for the purpose of entertainment
and showing you my designer shoe
collection it's for no other reason than
that it's not me trying to brag or
anything like that
if you don't want to watch it you don't
see what shoes I have mattes look like
off the video if you'd like to see them
and please do just don't leave anything
apart leaving any negativity down below
its just for the purpose of looking at
beautiful shoes and seeing which ones he
might like the most these shoes have
been collected over the years and I have
saved up my own pennies to buy every
single pair hopefully you love them just
as much as I do and let's just get into
it let's start off with flat shoes I'm
loving flat shoes right now I never
really have in the past but recently
it's all I've been about slow first up
we have this gorgeous pair of Sophia
webster's these are brand new season
these were aptly Sophia Webster
spring/summer 15 London Fashion Week
show that I went to in February and I
saw these look at them and then the fact
they came into the stores like I've just
got to get these it's the fact that
they're like little butterfly in the
front in rose gold threading is
beautiful for these I would say size up
one size I am usually a size 4 but I
found out more to size 5 in Sophia
Webster's so bear that in mind next up
the pair of shoes I have worn to death
these have been the best investment of
the year by far definitely I've worn
these to absolute death I've fallen
nearly every single day because they're
so comfortable the leather on these is
so beautiful and soft they have not
rubbed me at all which means I've worn
the Moose days whether a rose gold that
the Nicholas Kirkwood slipper flats
beautifully made gorgeous leather cute
little
tiny heel on them and put the pointer to
again I really have liked the point a
pointed toe for the spring/summer and
these come in a variety of colors this
one is quite hard to get your hands on
now as awesome the other metallics but
we've got pinks and blues and lots of
others seriously if you want to get some
make sure you get this leather the
leather style not a patent leather but
this kind of leather is so soft next up
are shoes that I mentioned in a recent
favorites and they are the aquifer at
Bellaire flaps like I said in that
favorites video I wanted the Aqua zero
Christie's for so long I scoured the
internet for about six months for them
finally these came in stock in a Navy
suede so they're absolutely beautiful a
bit more summer where they instead of
the black beautiful soft suede as well
it was up at the back of the ankle so it
didn't trouble you as much and how's the
lovely lace-up effect as well with these
little studs and silver heel and again
really quite comfortable and pointed toe
it's about the pointed toe apparently
okay next up let's do espadrilles a lot
of you are probably waiting for this my
new favorite shoes my Chanel espadrilles
I bought these last week when I was in
Paris on a beautiful victory raft trip
and we went to the Chanel store I find
these and literally this was the last
pair apparently in Paris
not to mention that store but in Paris
and and it was literally my size as like
this is fate I have to buy them I'm not
going to go into prices in this video
though if you're interested in the shoes
to buy them and you know for a while
this is a designer shoe video then go
and have a look yourself for the price
if you really read a lot of shoes the
next espadrilles and really been loving
are these from Easter I wore these when
I went away to Greece we've got this
iridescent almost pearlescent to come
you can't really see it down on the
camera but it's the pearl pearl finish
so it almost goes green in the light and
it comes around the back of the ankle
like this with little buckle they're a
bit more cutesy and girly than the
others and also a little bit more
affordable because they're Meester but
extremely comfortable true to size and
size full
for me and I thought these were really
cute expert RESPA drills are these from
Stella McCartney these are currently in
sale so as with all issues I'll leave
links down below for you can go get them
these are so McCartney in a animal print
over the top and around the back of the
ankle so for me I love these kind of
shoes because they don't rub me as much
or my uncle's open-toe as well and a
lovely sturdy base to these let's go for
sandals okay next up are these cute
little ones from Ted Baker super easy to
throw on these more like sliders gold
almost looks like a gold snake print
style croc leather might be sure if they
must be leather I'm not too sure
although lovely almost rose gold and
gold really comfortable and easy to wear
for holidays next up though are the best
sandals I've ever bought in my life if
you read my blog you'll notice these
have been in most of my blog post
pictures they are the Tory Burch sandals
that just go straight round the back of
a leg
these have saved made this summer
because I have rubbed my feet of so many
pairs of shoes and not been able to even
wear any shoes because they're with that
badly blistered and these have saved my
life because met my entire uncles free
super comfortable though very sturdy I
have it rub may wonderful shoes Tory
Burch and I'm going to put these in the
sandals category cuz I kind of see that
as heel sandals and they're another shoe
from Easter they make some really cool
shoes these have a white sole very short
one Santa makes a platform probably
about three and a half to four inch heel
it fastens around the back like this I
thought they were rather cute again for
holidays moving on to boots
first things first thing issues that I
wore so much over kind of February March
April with these Chloe boots again
they're in a favorites video beautiful
black leather zip to the inside gild
insert to the heel that wraps up and
around the back the heel
which is quite a cute little element to
it super comfortable like these didn't
rub me I could walk for Asian them I
remember in Japan I walked for about 10
miles in these things by learn about
Alan's done I was done but I still
managed it gorgeous gorgeous beasts
these are probably one of the most
expensive pairs here actually because
they're Chloe and they're more her
robust shoe I love them next up are
another pair of boots these are from
Coach you may spot them on my Instagram
the other week leaves a little bit
different for me I'll be honest but
there's something about them are really
quite light and I wore them Paris with
an outfit coming up on my blog soon
actually and it's on the Instagram and
Sony people love them and I got stopped
in the street actually in Paris and
that's where to get these from thought
they were really different they've got
this tassel with a little gold feather
to the side a long stiletto boot heel
and it zips all way up to the top but I
thought was a really cool pair of slouch
jeans and these something quite rap
shit' can sexy about them but you have
to wear them the right outfit these
could look very bad with the wrong
outfit definitely but with the right
outfit they'll be exactly what I was
wanting and the last pair of boots I've
kind of got three in each category here
last pair of boots
the Alexander Wang Gabby boots I think
these are called with the awesome cutout
heel with the rose gold insert I think I
really like this style thinking about it
now they kind of inserted gold sections
really really light and also rose gold
fit but again this is such lovely robust
leather and I beginning so much more
wear out than again over winter you can
still buy these as well I can still buy
them I'll leave all links down below
moving on to heel I'll be honest I've
got six pairs of heels I want to show
you just so that this video it's full
completely full these are pearly
Victoire heels I should've worn these
more than I have but just haven't found
the right outfit yet I know it's going
to come it will come at some point it's
marking its mark or winter heel with the
closed toe it's it's all way up the
ankle it's cool white lattice effect
across the front but there's something
about these are really loved and again
these are in sale and I bought them I'll
try and find a link if I can
next up one of the most beautiful pair
of shoes I've ever worn these are from
Gena shoes they made them for me for the
Cinderella premiere they wanted me to
have a glass slipper shoe and they made
them for me which was incredible and
they were perfect I actually wore these
to my mom's wedding as well two weeks
ago and I felt like a princess in them
they're just so gorgeous I can't tell
you completely coated on in Swarovski
crystals in fact these are the most
expensive pair of shoes in this here
right now these are so beautiful and
comfortable and look like this next up
are probably the most fun shoes I have
and they are the Sophia Webster
watermelon court rooms you would not
believe how many compliments I get when
I wear these literally every time I go
out in them everyone's like oh
watermelon shoes they're so cute and
they are super cute look at their bow I
mean the pink the green a little black
spot watermelons my favorite fruit had
to buy them
how to buy them they are so comfortable
you probably won't believe me but they
are super comfortable because this
plastic just molds to your foot so it
sticks to foots you can walk quite well
knees and not feel a thing beautiful
I'm almost categorizing issues as I
bring them out but these are my most
worn pair of heels they're the Jean Vito
Rossi I don't want the name of these is
but the jam Peter Rossi and I have the
nude backs with the white France I also
desperately want the black ones because
I feel like they go with everything else
and they're so comfortable but these are
ridiculously comfortable I went into
most events because the nude and the
white goes with every single outfit I
couldn't recommend these more the so
many different colors you can get as
well but a sharpie Taurasi are super
sexy gorgeous shoes very classic pair a
my Christian Louboutins I these the very
first pair of designer shoes I bought
years ago but the classic shoe these are
the hundred Pigalle pumps but they're
fairly easy to walk in but you're
probably already know Louboutins are not
the comfy shoes people make leave it on
no they're not comfortable the
Louboutins are sexy
heels and that's why we still buy them
because they're amazing and the very
last pair I haven't even taken out of
the box yet and I bought the use of the
day with my friends as a birthday drink
to myself because there was a handbag I
desperately wanted but I couldn't find
it and instead we came across these and
my friends like they look beautiful on
you and it was a little bit first sight
to be honest when I saw them I was like
I not got anything like these so a new
pair of Louboutins in fact this is the
first time I've had them out on any
social media I hope by now let me take
out these and it look seriously how sexy
are these shoes they're a cherry red I
think the column Imperial Rouge super
shiny the 120 heel so check out that bad
boy that's yes it's a massive feel
they're not comfortable at all
I'll be honest with you what they look
incredible and when you wear heels it's
not always about the comfort it's about
looking killer in your heels and these
are killer heels
I felt like Jessica Rabbit in them so I
thought a special birthday shoes to go
out on special dates in and to go to
special events in these were beautiful
and that concludes this designer fashion
shoe video really really hope you
enjoyed it yes I have been binging and
buying quite a few new shoes recently
it's what I decided to spend my money on
and I love shoes I feel like shoes are
what makes an outfit you could wear a
outfit from Primark from Topshop from
H&amp;amp;M a beautiful outfit and what can take
it to the next level is an incredible
pair of shoes a lot of pairs of shoes
here yes but I've saved up over long
period of time to buy them all and
absolutely adore shoes so hopefully you
might have been inspired yourself if
you're looking to purchase maybe your
first pair of shoes or maybe your second
or your 50s and maybe see the pair of
shoes here that you love for the rest of
summer and maybe going into winter like
I said I'll leave links for everything

really really hope you enjoyed it if you
