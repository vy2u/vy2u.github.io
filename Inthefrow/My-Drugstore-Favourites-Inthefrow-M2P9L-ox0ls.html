favorites video I figured that I always
use a lot of very designer luxury
products because I personally like a lot
of different rums so in the kind of
higher-end category but I thought I
would show you a few of my favorites in
the drugstore category and the much
lower end lower price category for
anyone that's looking to update their
beauty collection and is looking for a
few new inexpensive but really good
products so I went rooting through my
makeup collections have a look at the
products that I do keep in my main
collection that I'll go into now and
again then how I want to mix up it's a
bigger pile than I thought it would be
there's a lot of products here so I'll
try and show you a few different
categories of products also ways you can
use them think I'll start with sort of
the base upwards gonna start with
moisturizer now this will not come as a
shock to a lot of you but it's the regen
free this is around three pound three
pound 50 from Aldi after home bargains
and also Amazon so it's about four or
five pound Amazon but it's the best
moisturizing cream I've ever ever used
it's for reducing scars taking away
blemishes loosing redness it's for
stretch marks and I just find it's a
brilliant all-around most riser I use it
at night I use it in the day and I
absolutely love it so thanks that in the
routine would be the base so I have two
here two products that I really really
really like now I mentioned this in my
July favorites this is a L'Oreal magic
skin beat by a BB cream this is
beautiful skin gives a really flawless
look without being too cakey up too
heavy it's not overly high coverage but
it really just creates a flawless
looking skin
this is the boudoir healthy mix a lot of
people really love this I have it's in
shade 52 which is a little bit more
yellowy tones because I prefer a yellow
tone foundations gain and really sorry
from here builders but they're taking
down the scaffolding and it's no time to
film so I'm just left with a lot of
clanking outside so I'm really really
sorry yes so the helmets foundation this
is quite a medium coverage nothing too
heavy you can build up if you want to
but I find it so really really love the
shade lovely finish it makes the skin
look really healthy with a radiant glow
and it's quite expensive I think it's
about 9 pounds this is also about 8
pounds as well so if you have a go-to
foundation if it's a BB cream but I
found that both fantastic and I would
alternate between the two the next
product in my return will be concealers
now I have two here that I really really
like got a very Maybelline eraser i
perfecting cover concealer this is
amazing have uses a few times in
different makeup tutorial videos it has
this little soft sponge end which means
you can apply it really reflects the
skin Pat it in and gives the same effect
it would be with a brush but it's a
really really love that coverage and it
gets with dark circles or anything well
something even a little bit heavier this
is the Rimmel wake me up concealer
that's another recommendation actually
for foundations I also love the Rimmel
wake me up foundation find out some
fantastic foundation as well if you're
looking for one well this is concealer
and the two go together perfectly but
I've run out of the foundation the
moment this is in the shade ivory and
it's a beautiful beautiful concealer it
really opens up the eyes it gets rid of
dark circles gets rid off under eye
shadows
I think it might have light reflecting
particles in it that really create that
anti fatigue effect and brighten and
other agents so these two again a very
mixed
surfing's I got seven pound and this
play around seven pounds well and both
are fantastic I use this every single
day
so I might still talk about things I
also apply these products with so I use
the Real Techniques brushes again
they're really quite an expensive and
they are such fantastic brushes it's
powder brush I use the contour brush for
highlight because I have other brushes
for contouring the blush brush is
brilliant the buffing brush is fantastic
to blend in all of your foundation onto
the skin that's beautiful and I also use
a highlight now and again and makes a
parities up brushes depend on what I've
got I've got loads more in the
collection I've pretty much got the
entire collection but I thought just
bring these new out just to show you
setting powder so you put on a little
face base you put all of you can see
there are many defectives I would use
the Rimmel stay matte trans loose
transparent powder in 0:01
it doesn't add any color to the face but
it just it just makes everything
flawless and set in place you can't mean
to go wrong with this it's a really
really good powder does exactly what you
want it to
there's no real soft transfer of color
it just sets and perfects the skin so
this is about four pound of things so
that's a really really good product okay
so I'm the bronzing products so I found
cheap products that I really quite like
and that is the sleek bronze block and
the body shop honey
bronzer now some people might classify
body shop as more high-end and not in
the drugstore but I personally bought a
shop is a little bit lower priced and
more in the drugstore category so sorry
if you see it differently but that's the
way I see it so I start put these
together this bronzer is around 12
pounds this bronzer I think might be
about 6 pounds now this brand block I
used today and I got it on my cheeks now
I don't even see it but it's really nice
and it's got four different shades a
dark brown to lighter brown and it
which means that you could potentially
spill it all over things and put it I'll
give you Margaret pink toned Bruns or
you could just use a pink on your cheeks
it's what I did feel that the deeper
color or you could also use it to
contour and then blush it's really
really cute you've got quite a few ways
wear it so I really really like that and
then the body shop honey bronzer is just
a fantastic product it's got the
honeycomb effect inside it it's more of
a gray tone it's not orange toned so
you're not gonna look ridiculously
orange and it's just a really beautiful
product it's a perfect amount of
pigmentation I think for bronze at the
hand of bronze what you can suite your
brush through it put onto your face and
it's but you're not gonna end up with
massive brow smears everywhere this
transfer is just enough product to
answer face to give you that perfect
contour I'll put it bronzed look and ya
know if you communica wrong with you
think these are fantastic bronzers so
those are my two drugstore face and
bronzers let's talk about blushes so
I've got a couple here and I've got body
shop the body shop blushes are really
really sweet with you quite a lot of
different shades as well
they're simply to uses in the shade
ginger and it's a really lovely light
pink but not too big pink I really love
this for those days something like that
that was about 910 pounds of thinks and
the higher end of the price points but
still a fantastic product and I've got
an Avon product here this is the ideal
luminous blush in the shade peach and
this is lovely now I'm not a massive fan
of the Avon packages I think this
doesn't need so much packaging for this
tiny blusher although I did have a rush
but I would never recommend to using the
brushes that you get in these pallets
because they're always pretty awful but
the actual shade of this is beautiful
again I do like my pinks this is very
similar to abolish it one book and very
light baby pink lip the peach and tone
and glistening shimmery particles inside
it's a really lovely shakes I really
love batchly and I think that is
eight pounds I'll leave all these for
everything below sitting down checked
out and have a look there one thing that
I picked up a while back that I keep
forgetting how good they are is by
fashionista but you can buy these
pallets huge huge mirror and then you
get you choose this little bull shares
our bronzers and you put them in
yourself situate your own palate now
these are around I think these are
individual around two pounds fifty and
the palate is a couple of pounds in fact
no I think what it was was he could buy
the palate and I'll fall for tenor so it
was just an absolute bargain
these are super pigmented as well like
say just how pigmented I really really
nice I highly recommend these actually
if you need a couple shades you want to
build your own palate just you've got a
couple of shades ready for a night owl
or didn't you make it for an hour or
anything like that so I really really
like those and like I said doesn't just
about ten power for the entire palette
highlighters so I got two highlighters
here that I thought I would mention list
of all the top shop highlighter in
crescent moon I'm wearing this today you
can see what I forgot just how fantastic
this is I barely used it I've got so
many highlighters but I love this
product so now I don't get this out much
much more I mean it the top of my file
so I don't forget about it but it again
it is so pigmented it's absolutely
stunning
it's got a very luminescent gold
champagne to pink shimmer through it and
it just transfers beautiful skin it adds
such a moonlight glow to the face it's
beautiful and I think this is around
nine pounds and then this is a product I
don't think I've ever mentioned on my
blog or on anywhere else actually and
this is called the jus appellate
I picked this up in urban outfitters in
the US and I'm pretty sure they still
sell it I'm sure you can get it
elsewhere as well
try and find some links actually but
this is a really really cute little
highlight cream highlighter palette it
goes from a very light champagne white
to a pink with bronze and peachy
highlight but I really really like it
and I think that cost me about six
pounds so that's a good little bad life
moving on to eye shadow I have a couple
to show you this long to things I've
mentioned before that I picked up in
America are the wet and wild palette
these are around three dollars each so
inexpensive I'm so brilliant I use these
daily I've got the walking on yet
walking on eggshells palette which goes
from very light to a brown to a
champagne II pink and this is the silent
treatment palette with a taupe purpley
grey a dark color and then a peachy pink
on the top and they're just a beautiful
pigmented they blend beautifully and
stay all day I cannot fault these
they're amazing a little bit more
expensive I think these might be nine
pound palette but these are the sleek
eye shadow palettes I have two of these
I have one in storm and I have oh so
special
Lissa specialist my favorite although
storm I believe someone knows stuff but
kind of a little bit longer but this is
what still looks like you get 12 shades
this one has a range of golden hues and
tones and then some dark navy dark green
blues really lovely and then oh so
special is beautiful it's got these
peachy tones I'm wearing a no actually
that you can see but and when it's got a
lot of peachy tones but then a few dark
Browns you can use three crease colors
and I could darker purple and black I
can use a darker darker purple to create
a wind effect today you can't go around
super pigmented last all day blend me to
flay they're great if you're going for a
little bit more expensive then I would
recommend some from their body care
now I'm not sure if it okay is
classified as the high end or low end I
would say it was slap bang in the middle
to be honest some of the products more
affordable so we're a little bit more
expensive but I would say the pallets
are fantastic if you're after and
eyeshadow palette since a Naked basics
guy sits 20 pounds and it's got six
shades net which are amazing I've hit
pan two of them really neutral shades
these are perfect for if you are at
school and you just need a very light
wash color on your eyes to be great at
the moment for the 90s revival look
that's coming back with a very light
matte brown look on the eyes but if
you're after some brown tones you have
it in a little bit more money than
twenty pounds of this I love it so for
eyebrows I have just used this on my
eyebrows but you can see this is the
beauty UK highbrow all-in-one brow
definition kits it's got a wax and it's
got three different shades which is
great because then you can really create
three-dimensional brows a little pair of
tweezers and a little brush on the kit
as well
however I would highly recommend behind
yourself a really good eyebrow brush it
doesn't really matter what you have as a
product to brighten your eyebrows as
long as the brush is good you won't have
good eyebrows I personally use a bobby
brown eye definer brush I realize that
isn't a drugstore product so I'm not
going to feature it on this one you know
I'm spend more on the brush than I would
on the product because it's all about
the rush really and how you use it but
these are brilliant really really like
those then to set them with I would use
the bow shock brush gel eyepieces for
years
it's brows in place it just brushes and
through keep them set in perfect shape
and they won't move all day so that's
about 10 pounds I think and I really
like that you are looking for a more
inexpensive brush though I would
recommend the body shop slanted brush I
again I use this for years and it's a
little bit larger than the brush I use
now I use a much smaller brush to really
get fine hairs but just to draw on and
fill in any gaps for more natural brow
look than this slanted brush the brush
up would do
I line out now I don't have my favorite
eyeliner here with me unfortunately but
I can tell you my favorite eyeliner from
a drugstore is most definitely if it
collection mm or the collection thinking
is known as now collection eyeliner if
it called the notes but anyway it's
about three pounds and I have used that
for my entire life of doing eyeliner it
is one of the best eyeliners out there
so go and get that but if you don't then
I just recently tried the new body shop
smokey - one gel eyeliner and this is so
good it comes with a little brush that
comes up on top and then this opens up
its little pop of Lima oh it's formini
really simple to use
I really like that and I think that
would be around ten pounds but I would
also recommend Maybelline the falsies
and this is quite a famous mascara it is
actually really really good
the way that the brush is angled quite
flat on the center around and the rest
which mean we can pull up the eyelashes
Omar
give them a good coating really really
like that and I think that's about 12
pounds
finally lip products I must admit I'm a
big fan of high-end lip products Aurelio
but there are a few and quite like
starting with the EOS lip balms these
are great with a quite moisturizing they
look super cute this little egg shape
quite on it to throw in your bag and
come in beautiful beautiful stems
bring the plate and they're like three
pounds the Revlon Revlon Super Lustrous
lipstick this is in the shade pearl no
it's not it's in the shade Skyline pink
in a pearl shade a very nude light pink
more much more nude more baby actually
but I really quite like this as a nude
lip that I like I've also got the A's on
lipstick and kiss me pink
that's a beautiful beautiful shade
and trust it's really really nicely
lasts quite a while that's really nice
and what I'm wearing now is the NYX soft
matte lip cream Antwerp I'm not really
still doing these they look very similar
but these are great because they're
matte go on I was like a cream and then
the dry very matte and the sleeper a
really great tint onto the lips and I
would also recommend the revlon
colorburst lipstick this is in baby pink
I use this quite often actually some
really nice baby pink shade so those are
my recommendations
everything you've got everything from
moisturizer to the base and the sealer
to the finishing touch Cheers
I really hope that was helpful those
inspired you towards female products for
your collection and products are
actually really really good without
having the ridiculous price tag so yeah
hopefully that's been helpful for you
