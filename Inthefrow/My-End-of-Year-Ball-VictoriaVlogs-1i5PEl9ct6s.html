today is quite a special day I am going
to an end-of-year ball at the University
that I work at we've been organizing it
now for months and it's finally here in
a big day so I thought that I would kind
of do a bit of a day in the life with me
Plus at the end of your ball later on
because we're going getting our hair
done got a beautiful dress to wear from
gorgeous couture and we're getting this
kind of a chauffeur to the place and
then it's at the Midland Hotel in
Manchester so it's gonna be an amazing
event and I thought I'd bring you along
with me
also I'm gonna nod at myself because
yesterday would have been the perfect
time to film um I went down to London
and I won a competition with company
magazine to shoot with cats Footwear so
I did a full shoot with them three
different outfits and that's going to be
in the June issue of comfort magazine so
I'll have to check that out but
amazingly they let me keep three of the
boots I modeled which is amazing so I
can show you first of all these are
their brand new boots coming up soon
painting black on black and completely
black boot which again is so cool all
the cat branding and then finally what I
think might be my favorite the classic
brown tan with black I love these I've
never actually owned a pair of cat boots
but they really come about the season
especially for festival season so these
are like a little pair of shorts up over
top will look adorable Zara crops wet my
ChopShop kind of pastel blue jeans some
boots that got from misguided
my Sandro coat that I wear pretty much
every single day and your plus seen it a
thousand times and also my new Kevon she
and two gonna in baby pink um alright so
after work
big today I kill someone just say it's
don't really gonna try
okay so I'm back from work I went in and
this morning I had a lecture with my
master's students on the international
fashion retailing program and now I'm
back because I need to get ready for the
ball office in a normal day I would be
in work until gone five but today I've
come home for lunch she seen my flatmate
am I'm gonna go out and get our hair
done and then get ready so hopefully I
remember to film everything that goes on
so Rebecca is going to get what you're
going to get back I've got wine being
wined and dined apparently this is the
inspiration table what a Bertini room
really nicely salon
like centuries
it's only UNIVAC just cut back from the
umberto genie any salon has an amazing
time highly highly recommend it if
you're in Manchester really really great
there and my hair is so cute if you can
see it the mirror it's beautiful so now
I'm just gonna take off all of my makeup
and start all over again with a
completely fresh face so me Rebecca
thought we'd open some Martine yesterday
I've been saving it for the occasion and
it's my favorite drink
okay so almost fit try makeup
she's got my lipstick done got my eyes
done I just need to apply I've got these
beautiful lashes from and I'm Oscar to
put on to do my eyeliner get those on
get my dress on and they'll be
completely ready still on the martini

Sleeping Beauty straw my flatmate got me
for America like I said three straws
that beautiful yes almost ready okay so
got on liquefied I decided to go with
some ardell demi wispies lashes instead
and the other must go on just because it
was so big of so dramatic and I want to
go so so big but I can show you don't
mind my reaming in total tip this is a
beautiful dress gorgeous Couture big
slit in leg a Swarovski crystal sash and
one-shoulder it's totally different for
me I never wear anything like this
usually
but I'm so beautiful and I've still got
my hair done you know pick up really
