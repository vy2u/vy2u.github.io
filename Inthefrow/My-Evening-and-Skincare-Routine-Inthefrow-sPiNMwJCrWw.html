about my evening routines so I'm going
to go through everything that I do most
evenings and then my whole washing
cleansing and skincare regimes so most
evenings I will be working most probably
so I will be in my office and I will be
working away on my computer writing blog
posts maybe tweeting maybe instagramming
or editing new videos I need to get up
for you guys I often take a quick break
and I go and make some food or maybe
Alex will make it for me all depends on
the day so we'll make some food together
make some drinks and then we'll either
go and sit at the table or go and sit in
front of the TV and we'll put on one of
our favorite TV shows and sit and chill
and chat and watch one of our favorite
shows without food then quite often
after we've eaten I will go and continue
working for a few more hours so I'll go
back and continue editing I'll continue
writing or maybe editing up some new
photos until it gets to around 9:00 p.m.
now and again we'll mix it up Mabel goes
to gym maybe we'll go out for some food
maybe we'll order in or maybe we'll have
a movie night but most nights it's
usually working eating some food working
and then chilling out a little bit later
on and then it comes to my favorite
times of the day which is when I get to
take off my makeup first product I
absolutely love to use it's a fish eat
pure eat thermal waterproof eye makeup
remover but as an alternative the Chanel
gentle buy phase I make remover is also
just as fantastic my favorite kind of
cotton pads are these from boots which
are the baby large cotton wool pads
you'll find these in the baby section so
I use one of these and I'll just account
some of the our makeup remover onto the
pad before start working it onto my eyes
obviously you don't want to drag too
much I'll pull your eyes too much so I
place the pad and the remover onto my
eye lashes just to help break down some
of the mascara first of all before then
wiping it all away
massaging it into lashes to remove
anything else with these two eye makeup
removers you'll find that everything is
gone will be no dark shadows so we know
a scar
left in your eyes they are so amazing
I'll then you for ever's left on the
cutter power to wipe away any other
excess product on my face just to help
start breaking down all the foundations
and concealers and the powders it just
helps a wipe away almost a top layer of
this before I go in with my cleanser now
I have two cleanses of choice the first
one being the Eve LOM cleanser and a
second one being Sarah Chapman skin Isis
ultimate cleanse both are quite thick
and viscous gel style cleansers the Elan
cleanser is thicker and it melts down on
body heat as soon as you put your
fingertips onto the product it starts to
melt down and then melt onto your skin
Sarah Chapman ultimate cleanse is very
similar it's more workable and more gel
like the Yves lon they feel that really
helps to break down all the makeup on
your face while really getting into your
pores quite deep when breaking
everything down so I'll take a little
amount of this on my fingertips and then
I'll start to massage it all the way
around my face working it all the way up
into my hairline over my nose over my
chin and down my necks and my whole face
is covered in cleanser this point this
is where I like to use one of my tools
to help cleanse and I have two favorites
first being the foreo cleanser this is a
palm-sized
handheld device that you can work all
over the skin to really help cleanse the
skin much deeper and you could do with a
cloth or your hands it vibrates when you
use it and this helps to almost dislodge
all the dirt out of your face and to
really help it come to the surface so
you can then start to wipe it away and
the Clarisonic is an equally brilliant
product which is very well loved and for
this device you have bristles which you
work into water and then onto your face
and the idea is that the water is pushed
off of the bristles down into your pores
to really help unclog and almost push
out all of the dirt from all of your
pores I'll maybe use the Clarisonic
twice a week and every other day I'll
use the foreo just synthetic brush head
and therefore a little bit more gentle
especially on my more sensitive skin so
the way I use it is that I turn this on
I'll put a little bit of water onto this
before I then work it onto the face and
I'll vibrate it around one side of my
face over my forehead down
I'd cross a chin and then down the nose
just roughly like the entirety of my
face has been cleansed and then I'll go
in with a cleansing cloth this is a
bamboo cleansing cloth by pixi which is
really quite thick and really lovely
actually to use this one I'll make sure
his look warm and then I'll just wipe
away each section my face so one section
and I'll rinse that off the next section
give it another rinse the next section
next section etc just so everything is
completely clean I'll really work it
into the hairline so I'll try and get
any other product out of my hairline so
after that I will Pat off my face
really really softly it with a towel and
my face is uber clean you will not have
any makeup on your towel that is for
sure this point I'll usually have a
shower because I like to shower right
before bed and then I'll put on some my
favorite pajamas and then it's on to my
skincare routine so at the moment I have
quite a few products that I'm absolutely
loving as a regime I miss Pro intense
eye and lip contour cream this one I use
mainly for the eyes I'll take a little
section of this onto my ring finger I'll
then Pat my two ring fingers together to
disperse a product I'll Pat those
underneath my eyes really really softly
and over the top of my eyelids also then
it's time for moisturizer and the one
that I'm truly in love with right now is
the Lancome Visionnaire nuit beauty
sleep Perfector the consistency is very
much like a bouncy gel you can just get
a little bit of this onto your fingers
and then work it onto your skin and it's
just very liquidy and hydrating but I
just really feel like it's doing a
wonderful job to my skin and that's why
I love it so much then on my lips I will
use some Carmack's I have trusted comics
for years to be my nightly lip balm as
you'e probably know this is one of those
lip balms that you can put onto very dry
lips and it will sting slightly it's
really working hard to break down any
dead skin on your lips to really nourish
them again and that's what I really love
about this you can almost feel it
working every morning I wake up my lips
are so much more plumped and hydrated
and moisturized so I always love comics
for that reason then it's on to my
lashes and this is only something I've
started doing recently ever since I had
lash lifts recently lady in the clinic
told me I needed to start looking after
my lashes and really nourishing them she
showed me this which is some Nouveau
lashes conditioning serum it's a clear
gel on mascara wand and you add it onto
your lashes every night before bed and
I've been really really enjoying doing
this I just like the idea that I'm not
only putting creams on my face and then
I'm covering up my lashes I'm doing my
lips it's almost like my entire face is
just ready for a good night's sleep when
my face is completely done then I move
on to my hands before I go to bed and
the thing I've been loving recently is
this from Margaret dance which is the
nail and cuticle serum because I've been
getting shellacs recently I really need
to take care of my nails and make sure
they're much more oiled and moisturized
and hydrated so this is a fantastic
product it just dispenses out of the top
I pull map it onto the top of my nails
before I then it massage it into my hue
turkle's and over top all of my nails
and a few nights a week I also do this
on my toenails as well just to make sure
that they are just as hydrated as my
fingernails are and after all of my
nails have been covered that's when I go
in with a hand cream and this is my
current favorite the hand chemistry
extreme hydration concentrate which is a
wonderful thick gel with an almost
silicone feeling so it glides onto the
hands and makes them feel so silky soft
and beautiful I'll use this over the top
of the nail cream all over my hands
before I finally go to sleep then at
this point when I'm all tucked up in bed
I'll probably go and spend another 15
minutes on my phone checking into the
ground seeing if anyone's put up any new
pictures checking my tweets and seeing
my last minute mentions and I'll put my
loan my phone put it down have one last
wig water and then fall asleep and
that's my whole evening routine really
really hope you enjoyed this I've been
meaning to get this video to you for a
while and show you my new skincare
routine because it's truly helping me
hopefully found a new product there that
