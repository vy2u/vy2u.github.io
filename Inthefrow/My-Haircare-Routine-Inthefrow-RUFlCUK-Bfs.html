of all I start off by shampooing my hair
with the Paul Mitchell super-strong
shampoo
I'll do this once with a small amount
and then I wash it again just make sure
it's completely clean and then I use a
Paul Mitchell super strong conditioner
to give ish that all the way to the ends
making sure I don't really touch the
roots get out the shower put my hair
into a towel just get rid of any excess
water on my makeup and then I'm ready to
start playing some products so when
you're all showered has nicely washed
and nice and soft with the conditioner
you've used your towel dried so it's not
so sopping wet but it's just nice a dump
I'm and this is a fun bit where you
actually use all of your favorite
products you got any covers I do have a
big variety products
I've got leave-in conditioning
treatments thickening creams sir sprays
heat protectants you name it I do have
it Michael bit on a sort of weekly basis
that we start four days and I wash my
hair these are three products I reach
for the most
I would say the DHD style foam to the
phone and just you in a second I'll you
see from the mumbles surf spray and I'll
also use the rocket oil in the light
color for light-colored hair so first of
all we have ADHD total volume foam which
I'll show you now
mix around your hands and then I would
put over my hair through missing the
roots they love food rest of the links
I'm gonna take off this necklace or it's
just going to get in our way okay so
after the volume foam I will use a surf
spray just so that when it dries it'll
be nice and separated and have a bit
more of a beachy look so I'll take this
spray spray through and give it a good
twist
like that too
so front three I'll then use a Moroccan
oil or whatever I have and I will put
about a 10 piece amount again put your
hands and then just throw the ends
blanks on the ends audience the more
towel dried your hair is the better this
will take to her as well here's my wet
it will be the same applying any
products and we're doing ready to dry
this is my beast of a hair dryer this is
the Philips
care control hair dryer doesn't say what
make it is but it's the one that's got
two little areas on it one for heat one
for speed and it's also got the ion
booster on and cold fitting and a ultra
turbo boost setting black well this is
really good hair dryer and what I would
recommend
okay so my hair is dry and this is kind
of what it looks like after drying
because I dried upside down as I showed
you I do that every single time flip my
hair over go upside down because it
gives so much more volume at the roots
as you can see although eyes my hand
almost feels really really flat like I
hate guns hairdressers when they dry it
down so I know yeah my hairdresser to
dry my hair upside down the salon every
single time to cancel it one so last
month's volume and that has also helped
offset by the total volume foam will
make it much bigger soft thicker as well
and salt spray will sort of separate at
the ends better give it a bit more
texture and then the aisle will have
also helped to make sure that the ends
were kept nice and soft which they are
good condition for bleached hair for
sure that's kind of my hair routine in
nutshell I thought that I would just
show you a couple more products that if
you were like wanting something a bit
different from I showed you first of all
these were I would also recommend
internet so instead of the ght to
develop volume foam you can go for the
Paul Mitchell sculpting foam pretty much
does the exact same job really really
love it again has similar kind of
Lovelace alarm scent to it and this
again is a brilliant product similarly
it's something that's also very similar
to those and then they kind of really
bitch to the Ruth get a lot of volume is
the
Phoebe texture addressing convene so the
bubble bubble texture cream again really
really great it's got really cute little
NZ soft clip off it comes out like a
song like a gel on the phone and again
you said rub it through rubber through
your ends and just things of your hair
and also gives it lots of texture so
that again it's great how to do two
sizes in this and one being this one
which is 60 mm which is about 10 pounds
and then for 20 pounds I think it's
about 150 mm maybe oh yeah great product
if you're after something like that
instead of the balloon bubble surf spray
that I showed you this is also a great
product to use instead and it's a toning
guy sea salt texturizing spray it's
really about four pounds with a small
bottle and if you thinking of getting
into salt raise something you could just
dry out to see if you liked it and
instead of the Moroccan oil because I
know Moroccan oil can be a lot more
expensive than other oils I also really
love this looks aisle from Weller
another really great product works very
similarly I would say it's not quite as
thick as the Moroccan oil um but just
very very similar and I use it for at
you for I use oil and really love to
anyway so that's just another
alternative you know as you can see it's
so quite kind of big and quite fluffy to
make it less fluffy so if I did this in
the morning and I want to go out I would
apply a bit more salt spray
give it a really good brush and apply
some hairspray to it so I'm roughly not
with my hands a little bit and put the
hairspray through it run it through it
and it will go touched off smaller
chained but I usually when I wash my
hair I wash it in the evenings so that I
can go to bed with it like this and in
the morning I wake up all the sort of
fuzziness is gone and soft large because
it is gone from it and it's just sort of
left with the volume so that's why I
don't do tonight I hope it's been
somewhat helpful for some of you maybe

hair care routine and please go onto our
blog in the fro calm I've pretty much if
