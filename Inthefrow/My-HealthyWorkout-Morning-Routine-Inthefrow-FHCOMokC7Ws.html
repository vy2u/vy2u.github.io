video this one is all about my healthy
and workout routines so I wake up at 7
a.m. first thing I always do is make my
bed it's still super nice and tiny if I
do that I open the blinds let a bit of
light in and first thing you do is get
straight into my gym kit if I do this it
means I'm in the perfect frame of mind
to start the day after all some
deodorant this one is from Mitchum it's
just really lovely to keep me fresh all
of the day and then I'll make my way
into the bathroom to start my face
washing and brushing routine and this
video is actually sponsored by and paid
for by LMS you wanted me to show you
just how much I do their brand new
biotech skin energizing range which I've
already mentioned I am obsessed with
till this is the time that I get to wash
off everything that I've had on my face
overnight once I've slept in at the
moment that's the LMS biotech skin
analysing night cream which I really do
adore it's like a cream serum kind of
hybrid it's so moisturizing and
hydrating on the skin and I'll wash that
away with the LMS biotech skin and a
giant cleanser which is just the most
revitalizing wake-up call for skin it
really does just enhance dull or tired
skin which I have a lot of at the moment
it just makes me feel so much more
energized and my skin just feeling
really booted and revitalize for the day
and afterwards I'll walk straight into
the kitchen and start my morning
breakfast for me and Alex so this is
where I pull out the Meucci bullet and I
make my favorite banana peanut butter
smoothie so these are all the
ingredients you need some really great
ripe bananas to make a powder some chia
seeds and also some cocoa powder we've
got some honey we've also got some
cinnamon if you like cinnamon you leave
out if not and also some wonderful
peanut butter and of course milk here
I'm using organic but you can also use
almond milk we just ran out of almonds
so this is for two people I put in 3
bananas then I'll put in 1 tablespoon of
honey and just drizzle that around all
over the top with sort of sweetens up a
little bit then I go in with half a
teaspoon of some cinnamon just put a
little bit of added flavor and then one
tablespoon of
peanut-butter and going for the crunchy
whole earth here you can go for smooth
if you prefer then I'm going for half a
teaspoon of chia seeds half a tablespoon
of acai powder and then half a
tablespoon of the cocoa powder and then
I'll go with some Quaker Oats or some
rolled oats in that you have and this is
half a cup full and then a full load of
semi skimmed milk which is a cup full
again you can use almond milk if you
prefer just get that a little bit of a
shake up and put that on to my
nutribullet and it just gives it a
really good with around this nutribullet
is pretty new to us and we're obsessed
okay so this should make two full-sized
small tumblers full which is perfect
really this is one thick tasty smoothie
and it's perfect for before our workout
just gives us that kind of full energy
boost and kind of energy that will last
throughout the full workout and it is so
delicious you will love this so much so
at this point I'll sit down on the couch
with my smoothie and quickly go over my
blog or emails or comments and get back
to you guys it's just some time just to
kind of digest smoothie and get my body
working and my metabolism going and get
ready for some energy then it's about
time we went for our workout so I'll
just get myself a new gym top arm just
as a little cover up and most days I do
not wear makeup to the gym especially if
I'm going in the morning
so all I'll do is put on some day cream
just to make sure that my face is lovely
hydrated and again the LMS biotech skin
energizing day cream is my one and only
I'm literally using these three the
night cream cleanser and the day cream
in this trio and I'm just literally a
little bit like I've mentioned it a few
videos before really really adore these
as a trio that just so wonderful it
really just waking up the skin and now
I'm ready for the day it need to get on
my sucks and my trainers which are from
Nike and also just get everything inside
my gym bag so my little gym bag is from
all Akili in there I've got my
headphones you can't go to gym without
your headphones a tan little deodorant
just in case I got this gorgeous water
bottle from native I'll leave a link
down below
I've got a Stella McCartney swimsuit
just in case I decide to go for a swim
I'll go in a jacuzzi that day I've also
got my little iPhone holder my padlock
and my virgin active card I'm a big big
fan of the Virgin Jim and here I'm just
putting on another layer this is from
sweaty Betty it's just a really nice
light overlay and I'm ready to go so I
head out the gym quite often I'll be
either myself on my own or with Alex and
we'll head off and do about an hour and
a half so around 9 o'clock I head back
into the flat and need to get myself
ready for the day so I'll quickly have a
shower and freshen myself up I'll come
out with my towel head on into the
bedroom get myself dressed for the day
and ready to kind of start working and
feeling like a real human being again so
here I'm just wearing some new pieces
from Vince that I really really love and
I head back again on some sofas so I'll
either work from my desk or I'll work
from the sofa depending on what I'm
working on a time I'll just pick up my
laptop
sit back do some lots of work and that
is my day ready thank you so much for
watching guys see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
