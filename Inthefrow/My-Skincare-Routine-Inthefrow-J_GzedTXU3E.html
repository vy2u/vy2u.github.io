put together a skincare routine video so
that's what I thought I'd do today so I
thought maybe we could start with the
morning routine so I wake up generally
and the first thing I do is go into the
bathroom and I will wash my face and I
do that every single morning with this
which is the Johnson's face care daily
essentials gentle exfoliating what I
find this to be quite gentle but also it
does have a little bit of self abrasive
texture in it and then it's got these
kind of expel dating beads really
something working to the skin you just
thought a little bit about how water rub
into your skin it removes all makeup all
dirt and the skin feels really kind of
fresh really clean but not too dry so I
find this to be pretty much perfect for
morning and for night and a few times I
have also switched to the other joneses
product similar to this or it's not an
exfoliating wash it's a gel wash which
is even more gentle and not so abrasive
exfoliating so if you prefer things
aren't quite as exfoliating highly
recommend the gel wash otherwise this is
amazing and I've used this now for a
blur for about nine years and it's never
failed me and after that I will use my
favorite moisturizer that I've ever used
which is this the regen cream you can
pick us up I think in Astor Tesco it
used to sell of places like whole
bargains I can think but you can also
get it on Amazon for about seven pounds
fifty and after it's about three pounds
fifty so which I found in us if you can
but as you can see from the white and
orange branding it's kind of a duplicate
off by oil which obviously helps to
reduce scarring blemishes stretch marks
that kind of thing
and so this is obviously great if you've
had sparks and you've got blemishes now
and you've got a bit scarring a new face
from those this will really help to
reduce those take away the redness and I
found this when I went through moving
about stage of having quite a few spots
on my face really broke out badly and
was just really panicking about it I
thought right I'm gonna try this but on
my face and within about three days they
were so reduced and then when we could
pretty much have gone and I tried to get
rid of the scouring of those for over a
month and it completely took them away
so after that I realized this is my
miracle product so I use this every
morning was me for my makeup but it gave
us a really great base for makeup it
makes your skin feel really moisturize
really fresh
stop clean and nice so this is highly
recommended this is the pro hygiene
collection makeup protocol inna got this
from cult beauty and it's just brilliant
before spraying all over your brushes
and over the products as well and the
spirit of your brushes went on to self a
cotton pad it takes away all of the
product that's been on there all of the
day and you can put the antibacterial
gel brushes on and it just means that
you're not brushing dirt back into your
face every day and it keeps them nice
and clean without obviously needing a
really deep wash your brushes all the
time which can take time so if you just
want a really quick fix this is a
brilliant product other things you can
also invest in I recently been loving
this Elizabeth Arden BB cream obviously
it's not necessarily part of your
skincare routine to do things like this
but it definitely helps for one day also
a week to reduce how much from that
foundation you put a new face and put
something much lighter
onto them instead that can't help your
skin that has most of my stories and
properties in it so BB creams really
good for that this one has been amazing
and definitely buying this again I think
it's about 17 pound for this little
bottle but a little goes a long way it's
most incredible Julie finish you might
see my last makeup video that I did and
I use this it's just the most gorgeous
to finished perfect kind of shade for me
this is shade one but it just means
you've got soft light face
it's given me a skin a bit a bit of a
break you can breathe it better for that
day or so and you might even find that
you want to switch from foundation to
this for most of the week in which case
is giving your skin a really good soft
boost so that's something to think about
anyway and then I also finish off my
makeup every day with a hydrating face
mist generally this one from balance me
which is really really lovely
I think this might be about 20 pound per
bottle but it's kind of got a really
lovely kind of rose herb all kind of
scent drink and fresh it's really really
nice
but just fish of my makeup spreads at
the top but set so you make up but
ulcers kind of gets that bit more of a
boost a bit more moisture back into your
face game so that definitely helps kind
of keep you skin feel a bit more plump
and happy throughout the day okay so
then I get home from work home from
wherever I've been that day and
generally I will take off my makeup and
things right before bed so plate
I should really take it off bit earlier
oops I get a bit late mix it down
get blogging do something else and then
I think I need to go to bed I got makeup
now so that's what I do
so generally every single day I will use
this they've got a sharp cream cleanser
it's by far the best eye makeup move
that I've ever used I know that a lot of
people like to use it at micellar waters
and master of watery products for their
eye makeup I've just found that
switching to a cream cleanser it just
really takes away all of your makeup
while it's really moisturize in the eyes
I feel it's not as abrasive as putting
that water onto the paradigms of room
know if you face it kind of it takes
away that's off the bracelet Ness and it
really is I mean this is fantastic for
taking away all of your makeup and I
count on this for most days and I use
that with these actually I love the baby
extra large cotton wool pads obviously
found these in the baby section of food
just what they're just brilliant past
taking off your makeup they're about to
pound fifty four pack of sixty but
obviously they're really really big and
you can just get those cream onto their
wife or all of your eyes do you're the
right wife off your face and you've just
used one pad instead of getting all
those little pads using one use in 2003
and and these because after that their
baby ones they're really really soft and
mean the gentle on your skin which is
that which is what I want to because I
have to have fun with my eyes especially
in the winter get a really dry and can
start being a really sore so I really
wanted something that was really soft
really gentle and sweep away our makeup
and we'll go for an evening where I've
been out on tone
our shadow Arlo's Berliner maybe some
false eyelashes and we need something to
take it off really really quickly I'll
use some even more powerful cleanser and
for that I have been using the Clarins
instant eye makeup remover I mean you
may have seen this before but it kind of
it's in two different and it's almost
like a water solution and mybay oil
solution which separates into two colors
you place in this but on the shelves but
when yourself mix it up mix the two
together so you get the effects off
sophomore water-based cleanser and an
oil base and obviously oil-based are
really brilliant for take enough even
though I still burn scar is and
waterproof mascara is so this even says
it's for water for me from heavy makeup
so you must have put this onto a pad
sleep away and it just takes off so much
so it only takes you a couple minutes to
take off on right makeup then I'll go
back to my Johnsons and I'll take off
all the rest of my face make sure if
I'll completely clean so then it comes
to night time getting bed I sit down
with my little table I have for lots of
little products and I'll put on all of
my products before bed it's quite a nice
variation things really I'll use this
for balance me under eye cream and it's
a soothing brightening and lifting eye
cream I just add a little bit onto the
back my finger it's just a really nice
elf cream a solution
I sought to use my ring fingers or not
Pat it all those knees my eyes and look
both my eyes but mostly Dozen easy outs
just kind of give them a little bit of a
boost for the evening again I get really
sore eyes especially in the wintertime
so I like just give them a little bit
more moisturization if I can and this
has been really really lovely I can't
how much this is it's might be about 10
pounds most evenings I've been using the
LA roche-posay effaclar duo and a lot of
people of Jesus it's more of a sort of
serum and it's actually meant to be for
skin that's a bit more acne or blemish
prone which I'm not really but I really
love the way this feels on the skin so I
gave it a go and really got into it in
the end it's about 13 pound bottle and
but a little goes a long way and you can
keep the bottle going for a couple
months actually so this I've had for
quite a while those days we've had a
really horrible wintery day it's really
tight really dry I will use something a
little bit more heavy so this is about
me moisture rich face cream extremely
moisturizing it's kind of like an
intense moisturizer it's quite much of a
heavier cream but it does work the same
way I can gently massage it into the
skin and it just gives that intense
repair and moisturization overnight
which is really really great again it's
got a gorgeous balance me rose and her
what kind of smell but I really really
love so just smells really fresh and
really lovely and you do wake up feeling
you skin
feel so much more lovely and nice and
bright so this is how I recommend it for
those really dry skin or for the
wintertime laughter my face cream is
applied I'll then go in with comics
which I've mentioned before and probably
one of the best lip balms I've ever used
and great for sort of intense overnight
apparently lips because I do get quite
dry lips sometimes especially in winter
so this is my I definitely go to every
single night something that's not overly
necessary but I love it anyway is the
Clarins advanced extra firming neck
cream obviously at this point in time
there's nothing on my neck and I've got
any wrinkles or anything like that in 30
years time I probably will do so why not
start now the same way that we're all
starting now in anti-aging moisturizers
for our face so this is a really really
lovely product if you want to sort of
continue moisturization of your face
auntie neck doctor I provide all my
moisturizer to my face
I then put a little under my hands of
this it's much more of a serum cream
less really nice and light and you saw
rub it all the way down your neck and it
just makes you happy face and neck good
feel of any moisturizer means ugly so
that is something that I probably will
count out buying and I'm gonna do love
and love new things so yeah great
and then to finish that Olaf I will use
a hand cream so this is a Laura Mercier
and rate vanilla Sufi body cream I've
been using it as a hand cream I know
that they also do this range with a hand
cream but I just got this and aside just
use coconut but it's the most incredible
smell ever and absolutely love vanilla
so if you like vanilla and those kind of
really creamy cents and you are
absolutely adore
and let me to sweat same wait how creamy
and they stop really work some skin and
makes me feel yourself moisturize really
in the morning so that's how they
recommended so that is it those are all
the products I use my skincare routine
running at night I hope that maybe some
of them you already have or maybe some
of them you might want to go out and buy
and sort of add to your routine and
coming I do really love all of them and
I use them daily and I feel like they
really help my skin a lot so hopefully
this been some sort of help for some of
you let me know in the comments if you
want any more information on any of the
products and quite a few of these I've
also blogged about and reviewed a
natural block so feel free to click the
