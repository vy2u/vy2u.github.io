as you seen from the title this is
probably one of the most requested
videos of the past month or two months
so many of you have asked me to film
this video and I always said I wanted to
wait until I've got one more tattoo
before I filmed a tattoo video because I
felt like four four one two three four
five for like five wasn't quite enough
tattoos to create a full enough a tattoo
video I mean no people have made them
before and they're always really really
good but I'm sort of thought I wanted a
few more but now I have six I still kind
of feel like is that enough to make a
tattoo video but you've all asked for it
so I'm just going to do it anyway I'll
start from the first one I ever got the
last one I ever got and I guess the
general consensus with these videos is
to go through campaign one I had got it
etc etc so I try and include as much
information as possible I'm going to put
in here now that if you don't like
tattoos and you don't want to know about
tattoos then you might as well click off
this video because you're not going to
appreciate it so please don't bother
writing down below that you hate tattoos
or tattoos or glaze everyone has their
own opinions and these are mine and I
like tattoos I enjoy getting tattoos and
yeah that's my opinion let's keep this
all very positive if you don't want to
watch it then feel free to click away if
you'd like to watch the egg-cam you're
watching ok so the first tattoo I ever
got I was in university I was 20
just turning 20 think uhm and I got it
down my back down the back of my neck
says you live you learn
which is an Alanis Morissette lyric from
Sankhya learn I know that she wasn't the
person who made up that saying well it's
still something that resonated with me
personally from a very young age back
when I first started listening to honest
Morissette when I was maybe 12 11 12 and
the Jagged Little Pill
so that saying was always something I
kind of live by and it's a bit of not
applying there like you'll if you learn
everything that you do you're going to
learn by it so it's almost like
everything every twist and turn that you
make in your life you'll always learn
something from it whether it's bad or
good it was really painful I'm not lying
to you but with it being the first
tattoo ever had I mean I also have
always been really scared needles and I
am still very very scared of injections
and needles like I'm what a very
squeamish person so when it comes to
needles and the whole like oh God to
think about it it's making me feel funny
a tattoo is an injection it's just
tapping away at the top layers of your
skin I kind of felt differently about it
so I wasn't quite scared I was squeamish
towards they I just need it's gonna be
painful whenever anyone asks me how much
it hurts to get tattoo obviously it
hurts a lot anyone that tells you it
doesn't hurt it's talking absolute
nonsense
total rubbish not the nicest of things
to think about but I think it feels a
little bit like a tiny scalpel going
away scared almost like cutting through
yeah it doesn't it doesn't make it sound
very very nice but if you've got
tattooing that you really really want
you just got to go through that pain and
get through it
that's what it personally feels like to
me Alex just said that it doesn't feel
anything like that for him but that's
what it feels like to me on a scale of
like one to ten of how much it hurt I'd
police say it was up there in like the
eight or nine and I was just swearing
away while she was tattooing my back and
it wasn't very very pleasant and it took
about took about 20 30 minutes to do
above the letters also has like these
vines that kind of crawling on my neck
and across the way as well it's almost
to symbolize the way that you sort of
grow and change direction and you know
it's just coming as symbolizing a growth
really okay so tattoo number two was
this one on my left forearm it's a
feather I realized it's quite generic
tattoo to get but I really loved it I
sort of came up with overall style and
shape a length and everything else
myself
I went to a tattoo parlor again in
Manchester and it was an awesome tattoo
it's actually called phil wilkinson i'll
leave his and scram down below so you
can go and appliques works really cool
so the overall idea behind this one was
I just come back from a 12-week tour of
America and it was one of the most
life-changing holidays of my life and
summers it was incredible and I kind of
felt like it was first time I thought
it's cliche - sounds its first time I
sort of spread my wings and done my own
thing and does something on my own and
quite brave and out of my usual comfort
zone so I wanted something to symbolize
this kind of freedom and almost like
spreading my wings so obviously I wanted
to get it on my arm
obviously tattoos mean something to each
person and they can kind of draw their
own stories around each one and that is
story for that one so yeah in terms of
pain I would say on a one to ten this
one was much much less I don't know why
it's just a more fleshy piece of skin I
suppose it's not quite sensitive and it
got to the point where I was able to
almost watch him doing this quite easily
without kind of flinching pain threshold
maybe about four out of ten perhaps
further up here not so nice but Festivus
wasn't too touchy number three was so in
fact it was just after I got this one I
wanted a little heart and I got it on
the inside of my foot just here sexy
pose Hill you know what I've missed one
hour I've watched him miss one out I'll
do it in a minute because I have one on
my other foot I want to have a tattoo on
each side of each foot they face each
other how is a symbolizing love
affection on the floor it doesn't feel
particularly great at police say it was
like six out of ten in terms of pain I'd
recommend if you're going to get tattoo
on the inside of your feet or any one
your feet is to potentially get it above
the line of where most shoes will touch
so both of my feet tattoos sit above the
line of all of my shoes when they come
around the edge of my feet so it means
it doesn't rub it off so my tattoo knees
are staying
pretty perfect to be honest okay tattoo
for which I've actually got this mix-up
and it's actually tattooed too but
nevermind it's on the other side of my
foot and it says arrived this was based
around another song that I absolutely
loved call arise funnily enough and it's
a song by Flyleaf infant of you know
that's not my Flyleaf anyway it's called
arise and the lyrics and song are arise
and be all that you dreamed it's not an
airy kind of rock song and at the end it
is really dramatic thought-provoking
emotional section of the song where she
sort of screaming like singing almost
screaming arise and be all that you
dreamed was at a point of my life where
I was going through a lot of education
and to the point where I was kind of
building my career and building the
building blocks of my life at the time
and to me when I heard that song it
really kind of hit me emotionally
because it was almost reflected the way
that I feel that only you can create our
own story in life and only you can pave
the way for your future so it was almost
sort of saying that rise kind of wake up
get out of whatever you're in at the
time and be all that you dreamed I
suppose and kind of get up and go do it
and Olli will get there in the end so
yeah so that's why I got it and I got it
on my foot because I fell off so that's
kind of my grounding into the floor and
to the earth and that's where I will
arise from so yeah quite a meaningful
one again I guess they're all quite
meaningful to me it was pretty saw and
that was probably again about six or
seven out of ten on the hurting scale
the fifth tattoo is this one here I got
this one a couple years back now it says
every word handwritten and if then if
you are gaslight anthem fans
then you will know this is a lyric from
the song and written on the handwritten
album yeah I just absolutely adore that
song it's one of my favorite all-time
songs but it's about that whole idea
that you kind of write your own my story
it's almost like everything I've done um
it's almost been like me who was written
my own story so that was my fifth and
then finally my sick tattoo and the one
that probably sparked the most people or
requests in this video it's on my wrist
my inner wrist wanted something
airfreight year that was almost
reminiscent of a crown and with floral
inspiration so I almost wanted to be
like an upside down crown with floral
petals and something quite abstract so I
went into this amazing tattoo artist a
couple of weeks ago she's called Kelly
at Parliament tattoo I gotta leave her
links below so good like her work is
insane like you need to follow her
Instagram it's beautiful I went in with
the idea I gave her a kind of a few
tattoo pieces a quite light and acid to
come up with something and this is what
she came up with yeah and it goes off
sit all the way up just a very very base
of my palm as well I guess this one
doesn't have quite as much story as the
other ones do twenty-something was a
crown with floral inspiration terms of
pain this was pretty damn saw especially
going right near to the bones on the
side of the wrist and also this area
here right at the very very front in the
par is so thin that skin I'm so
sensitive over the veins that was
horrendous took about an hour so it's my
longest tattoo that they've got and the
pain was probably it's in some points it
was a bit lower so it's played by six
but in the high event was play about
nine so it's pretty sore printer sore
and that's it I did not move this took
this video to go on this long I'm sorry
if it took so long and thank you
sticking with me on this hopefully I
helped you a little bit especially if
you're thinking of getting a new tattoo
were you thinking getting the placement
of it and if you're worried about the
pain obviously I think if you're wanting
to get a tattoo when you really love it
enough that you want to get it I don't
think you should let the pain warrior
you think that's just a very minor
things that you have to go through for
an hour or two and then after you've
done that it's a couple of hours of a
little bit of stinging and soreness and
then
that's it you've got a tattoo that you
really love on your skin forever then
and thank you to everyone that requests
this video I really hope that you
enjoyed it and it can lived up to your
expectations of this sort of video we
hope you enjoyed this if you did please

are new to the channel and in that case
