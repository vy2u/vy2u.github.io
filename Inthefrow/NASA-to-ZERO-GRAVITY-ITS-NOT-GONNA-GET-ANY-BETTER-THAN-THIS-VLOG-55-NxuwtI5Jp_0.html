any of you guys who watch the vlogs for
a few months you might remember this
moment
so does that mean even a good meeting
yeah idea it this time we're gonna do it
then this sounds awesome already after
that so the idea is that me and you
yearly you'll have white on it this
might be the coolest thing well the bits
that you missed out of that clip were me
telling Alex that we were gonna go into
Florida to visit NASA and the Kennedy
Space Center I'm gonna be doing
astronaut training in same so today
we're kicking off the whole trip with
astronaut training experience in Florida
and we're becoming a tuneup today Hey
okay so you might wonder why this random
trip came about so Olympus cameras came
to me and said what did you want to be
when you were younger so I only wanted
to be a ballerina
aha and Bastian arts I literally was
obsessed with space I have like big
prints of planets astronomy prints all
over my walls
I really really wanted to be natural and
then I realized I wasn't very good at
science so I gave up factory but Olympus
wanted to make my childhood dreams come
true so if they have organized his whole
trip they sent us to Florida so that we
get her to go to the Indy Space Center
we could be astronauts for the day I'm
just yeah it was so excited so if how
long is gonna be all about our space
astronaut experiences all with Olympus
this is a paid-for advertorial with
Olympus as well because it's all shot on
Olympus cameras and link everything down
below in terms of what was shot when and
what cameras just so you guys know I'm
excited to try out why
great heading out three two
that was that was the end how you
feeling the Bloods coming back two
minutes you're like screaming with
happiness yeah yeah we have it on the
second-fastest setting
hex e la what year 2017
2008 was it
a combination of all white okay
so mean I like so now fully trained
astronauts okay with new hotels we've
checked into a hotel really really near
to Kennedy Space Center and to what
we're doing tonight so going on a little
trip today
with day way tours they do this insane
paddleboarding experience we go out onto
a lake on a public board in the evening
at night and look how it starts it
sounds insane and that's what we're
doing tonight so ready for experience
and wood so we made today awake tours
very excited so we're on our own private
tour we actually realize until we got
here god I look very town on here well
it's in the middle of Titusville
Titusville I think it's called so it's
kind of hot out on the sticks so muskie
it was at eating Alex alive right now
thanks brain and this lighting and makes
me look extremely orange yes so we've
gone out on this private tour going over
to the oceans which right now no this is
so exciting this is just like such a
cool experience I cannot actually wait
we're gonna get so many cool shots from
this person okay we've arrived I don't
even know if you can see me here is
super dark who's got a little light on
in the van so just made our way down to
like the shoreline I'm not gonna be
heading in on pubs and now it's gonna be
on a kayak my hair is already feeling
the humidity like sweaty Florida thing
going on but so excited about this it's
gonna be a really really cool experience
unlike anything else we've ever ever
done in the dark so excited about it
can't wait to show you guys what we'll
do in so these are our paddle boards
this is so cool oh nice they are Hugh
yeah yeah wow that's incredible
but this is my paddleboard on the water
with these green line oh cool is this
line it's completely pitch black out
there see us on the girl right oh you
see a little bit of the horizon line
over now so we're literally looking
right at NASA from here and then we're
just going to be going out on to this
river which kind of leaves into the
ocean from here this is going to be
amazing but again you're gonna see what
up here you can see all the stars and
just about see the Milky Way's coming
out okay I don't know how bright this is
so we're gonna head out now on our
paddleboard
well actually I'm on the puzzle board
we're not sitting on kayaks because I
want to get some like really cool shots
and they saw that I'm probably gonna
fall in and they won't okay we've just
been taking some pictures before my
Instagram
hopefully seen so far just taken us
quite a while to get these really like
slow ship speed pictures in the actual
river so hope you like and now we're
finally gonna go out I'm gonna go on a
kayaking out I'm just in case it's a
little bit more safe for me cuz its
pitch black I'm gonna go do that and
yeah bring your line with us
we didn't looking around for all the
different like wildlife which is just
amazing this is so bright you never have
to see them oh oh that's so funny
yeah well put them in a jar and you'll
see how they move well they just came
out with some research recently the
jellyfish they have there they kind of
have a very basic nervous system they
don't have a brain but they have a very
basic nervous system that actually has
the ability to regenerate itself which
is pretty uncommon extremely uncommon in
the grow right even the neurons they
have a nerve net it's what it's called
not a brain but a nerve net in that same
study they were talking about how
she ever wanted to pretty much you see
an alien because these guys are so
genetically different than anything else
and they don't looking them like this is
pretty much the closest thing that
you've we have to daily so how many
spines or anything so funny oh my gosh
Wow but ah be just like Victoria's
regret in the genes song I love all
you've done with my clean I wore
swimming shouts did you enjoy that it
was really good I'm really worried that
we didn't capture what it was though I'd
really don't think we have it's one of
those things isn't it you just got to
experience straight off the back I was
brilliant really good
okay guess where we are we hear enough
for today where the Kennedy Space Center
we've just been dropped off it is like
7:00 a.m. we've had four hours sleep
today it's a big big big day this is
like one the main reasons why we're here
in Florida to visit NASA to do a full
photo shoot at the Kennedy Space Center
this is like my childhood dreams come
true times 1000 million so I've got all
my outfits with me I've got a full set
of Ted Baker outfits four outfits issue
four locations
I'm gonna bring you along with me to
watch this I actually have no word sent
up / so this is the Rocket Garden this
is just amazing
okay so this is outfit one location one
complete this place is it sakes this is
Atlantis this has been up into space
33 times and it's now here I'm like to
say this is just mind-blowing to me I
guess someone that's always been so
interested in space and like amazed by
it it's just incredible check this out
this is amazing if music is so fitting
for this it's just epic
okay we've made over to the second area
where we're inside Mission Control this
is a real set of emission control I
can't actually touch it but this is just
so so exciting being in here this is
just awesome but you're going to try and
get the lights on so you can take some
pictures here and oh my god I can't wait
to show you the Saturn 5 rocket because
it's out of this world okay shot is done

into now look at everything else well in
pain okay guys the best photo shoot ever
I am back in my other clothes and we are
just on our way now from the store yeah

just awesome I'm so glad we got to come
here it's just I feel so lucky so it's
just been doing a presentation here and
there's a big door closed and it opens
and then Atlantis is just here I was
just so cool
which is badass opening a million miles
126 million miles so I think well now
it's a mind-blowing opening I mean I
know we've had a little round only gave
me one of these faces
cake set we're gonna go now to have
lunch with an astronaut a buffet lunch
you take out your shoes you have to
okay governor you know I know
Who am I dating I really enjoyed it
awesome awesome awesome day educational
exciting informational great for
photoshoots so today is a super super
special day super exciting day I've lost
my voice because I mean all the days a
little bit jumbled than the past few
vlogs just so I can keep all the
relevant footage together and everything
like that yeah so my throat really bad
I've had a really bad cold so that's why
anyway
a very very very special day so with
everything that we've been doing on this
trip it's all been feeling this pen
passion project it's been in the
planning for so long and it was all
about kind of me being able to
experience my childhood dream of going
into space or being an astronaut or
going to NASA and it was also exciting
so first off we did astronaut training
so I could train to be an astronaut then
we went to the kayak tours and went on
earthy we went on the river into the
ocean and looked up at the stars with
stargazing with an astronomer and then
we went to NASA to see all the rockets
and the spaceships and to kind of get
immersed in all of that for the day and
then this today we just got back from
the zero gravity okay
much better
Oh much but now he thinks is poppin it's
coughing yes so we just got back no back
to the hotel room and it was so amazing
wasn't it yeah absolutely
the first bit it was the best bit I
think that we bit the first bit we
experienced you agree even because they
do it in stages so what is it it's it's
Matt Martian if you're late you see what
what you feel like you this way you feel
if you are on Mars
I mean I would feel a third if you wait
so you kind of come up a little bit yeah
but not like fully and then the second
two after that a lunar gravity yeah so
it's what you'd feel on Mars which is
like haha is where - that was the one I
feel like I enjoyed the most
yeah cuz you add Malcolm did you control
yourself a little bit more I can it
didn't make me feel sick at all the
effect no I didn't feel T well on that
and then you had complete zero gravity
after that yeah and that was how many
turns was that up and down was it about
ten yeah the weirdest most awesome
experience
yes trying to shoot like about in my
those conditions yeah trying to take
pictures laughter he was everywhere
upside down I was all everywhere space
we were ever flying away from each other
or flying into each other yeah cuz you
try and touch it like a wall or
something and you just gently just touch
it and you just suddenly you're still
you know you just fly away yeah it's
crazy
and then there's how many or four people
floating around
so such an amazing experience it will
we'll talk about forever yeah you know
it's one let's kind of I want to
lifetime experiences to do well it's
amazing so let's do the plane is this
going down and up yeah so so when it go
when it goes when it starts going up
you're literally you're on the floor and
you feel twice your weight and gravity
so you can barely lift your arms
everything's really heavy and you're
like just on the floor like this and
then you can just feel the plane let's
go like and you start going that way and
that's when you saw you lift honest like
you try and like if you lift you try and
lift your legs up off the floor when
you're lying down it feels like you've
got tons of bricks yeah it just feels
like you've got bricks attached to this
would be a great workout yeah but then
that you literally nobody even has to
tell it to stand up because as soon as
it hits zero gravity you literally just
start floating you just come on locals
fair yeah he has going everywhere
no like they called the bets event but
there was there was parts where I was
just flipping and it's it was bizarre
thing because you can just you just try
and do one front flip and you can just
do as many as you want but you can't
like put your feet down to try and land
yeah so you just end up just carry on go
how are you going to carry on flip it
even though you stood up straight it's
so bizarre it would have been cool if we
had all the whole plane and you just fly
from home side here that would have been
awesome I think you got to how many how
many turns and still started to feel a
bit funny oh yes oh yes so I'll secretly
imagine a lot of you guys have watched
my vlogs he'll know that I get really
bad motion sickness so we have been we
were really worried before I went on it
that would get motion sick so it took a
few sickness pills but I still got very
ill so I think it was on about the ninth
go is that I was actually sick and I but
obviously we're in zero gravity at the
time I don't say things hopefully uh
gravity it just goes into pockets so I
was trying to be sick and this bag you
know it wasn't pretty lesson
after that I body was like what is going
on but it was funny because you didn't
really see anybody else I only because I
only had my eyes on you could see if you
were okay yeah and then when it's
finished I notice everyone was like
wiping the floor cuz a woman in the grip
firming down there throwing up all over
the floor
so easy to throw up arrows just hail
yeah yeah the very end ever was to
ghostly white brown parks in their eyes
everyone just kind of like looking at
each other like everybody else feeling
the same
but then after about five minutes you
feel okay so so good gonna say if any of
you guys really like up for the side
trip due days oh great it's a lot of
money honestly but it's one that's once
a lifetime things you'll never do again
I mean it's just such a cool experience
yeah so what we're gonna do now sleep
that's what time is it you might have a
nap we might watch some episodes half
three yeah that's chill in bed and then
Goethals ready in a bed go out for some
dinner I want to feel like now it's not
the same get more done I know actually
good time us a second I want this plane
to lunch so real unreal so fun guys so
it's about 8:30 Vic's been asleep for
the past couple of hours
haven't you you feeling a bit better now
you think you definitely needed it
though yeah your voice sounded a little
bit better and you're not coughing as
much now I yeah I mean we were just
talking about it earlier weren't we
basically saying that if it was
yesterday the zero-gravity
oh I've got if they've been yesterday no
way I could not have done it you were
really bad you've really been up and
down how many bits with this illness it
got better then it got worse better go
with us so Victoria is a prime example
of not taking time off and relaxing you
get extremely ill yeah
you literally that's what you've done
you've been ill and you've slept but I
can't imagine you doing zero gravity
with how you were yesterday you were
sanity
that was it we were walking through the
the airport yesterday and I was
practically carrying you
I know you were just like oh you were
just dragging me like I was gonna faint
any much have no energy left in me at
all
yes horrible thank God I came around
today unless it's just my body going
right you're doing this today so why
don't you feel a little why don't you
yeah
no you'll be fine we're gonna have some
food now and then I have nearly night I
guess yeah I'm I'm pretty exhausted and
then we've got tomorrow we fly up
compile all stuff that we've been
working on because you guys have seen
loads of stuff by now if I you'll have
seen everything so everything everything
everything yeah by the time no Tommy's
gonna see this vlog that lets you know
all the bitches you won't have seen the
footage
all the footage though but you won't
have seen you might see little bits no
oh wait yeah you've just seen it I don't
even know what day is anymore yeah so
much time you guys see this skills this
is everything we've been up to over the
past 20 weeks there's been months and
months of planning to get us to this
point yeah so I'm so pleased don't have
a bang this year when we're fishing off
for you right so if you haven't had a
look at all the pictures NASA and from
today
hold on subway this so there's Vegas
weird Vegas we had Florida or two
universe so I went to Disney NASA and
NASA astronaut training widget we did
this today zero-gravity yes so make sure
you go across tomates come out in the
fro I'm so proud of all the images on
there we've spent so long putting those
together for you guys just so you like
them so we've got a bucket and we're
always accounting for beautiful
backdrops beautiful scenery I know I'm
trying to keep things interesting I
think we found them on this trip so I
really really hope that you guys like
them as much as we did
make them so how do we top zero-gravity
next they're not happening
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
