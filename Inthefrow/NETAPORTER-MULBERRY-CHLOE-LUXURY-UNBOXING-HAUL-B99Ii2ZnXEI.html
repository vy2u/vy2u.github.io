really well this is gonna be in a
support a hole I'm in the best mood
today sun is shining I'm just really
feeling so happy refreshed
I'm getting back to the gym again and
get back into my fitness
I've just got a really healthy positive
mindset at the moment feeling so good
I've got my kind of very minimal barely
that much maker well for me makeup lock
on my face I've just thrown my hair up
I'm sorry that I'm not super glammed up
today but I just wanted to film this
naturally be a bit more actual and
shield with you guys Dex I'm in such a
good mood so let's just get into it
these are just a few things that I
bought an inter-party a few days ago
just for my trip to India a few new
luxury pieces I saw these on I support a
and thought I would treat myself so
that's all it is just a few things in
here I thought show you so pretty huge
box I haven't even looked at this this
is a full unboxing come little peek
together I've gone quite Street this I
thinks it's come up - spring - no it's
really fancy being a bit more kind of
like Street with everything might not
suit me at all we will see together
won't we
the first thing I picked up I really
really wanted a hoodie to wear on the
plane to go to India and just for any
kind of it's not gonna be cold in India
well the rest is spring if it any like
colder days and I found this one from
off-white it's very light logo heavy its
kind of brash and it's actually not very
me but I just thought of someone to
throw on throughout the days with shorts
even us around London like this we'd
like some shorts and you know a bit more
dress down everyone can dress down when
they want to and this is what I wanted
to do that in so on the back it says
women but you know a lot of the
off-white tops do and then on the
princes off all over the world's
favorite women like that okay so I'll
try that on see what we think don't want
to get any makeup on this no my first
time you see me in a hoodie isn't it do
you like to wear hoodies now and again
though I like how cropped it is it's
kind of what I wanted it to be quite
sure sure really quite liked it I know
you guys have playoffs at home now I'm
Victoria we're all you see it's gone
but you know not everyone can wear a
suit every single day
and go to the airport in their comfies
in a sea off without let me know guys
down below what you think I mean by the
time you see this so I've made kept it
or may not have
but either way hopefully you don't hate
it I've kept it like it's very dressed
down I understand that but when I'm on
flight I like a good hoodie to cut luck
with and just stay nice and warm on the
flights it gets so cold
ok the next thing that I picked up was a
pair of shorts very similar to a pair of
shorts I've had in the past that I
literally war until he almost fell apart
they're just a very easy pair of navy
Navy shorts with gold buttons calyx a
bit bow Man esque with these gold
buttons well the quality of this is
really beautiful Lisa from Alison Olivia
I really really liked them I thought
they were just really really cool so
we'll see how did you get into them it
is just these actually undo the buttons
and you putting yourself back into them
but I mean this could look just super
nice just with a top like this like
really simple
I actually really like those the quality
is honestly absolutely gorgeous on these
they have pockets in them at the front
that's always applause and I like to
have little pockets usually you can't
get your hands in them I like to have
pockets on the balm because I just think
it looks a lot like a little more
flattering on the behind okay guys so
short so I'm absolutely besotted with
these I must admit they fit so nice
around the waist
they are perfect that gorgeous and
high-waisted they are amazing they're
perfect high-waisted fit they fit really
lovely my but honestly the quality these
are so beautiful they are long enough I
don't feel like I'm showing too much leg
down here there can the perfect length
for me they just feel I can really love
a shirt that I could wear for more
evening occasions and events with some
gorgeous heels and a little top or I
could just wear it on holidays the kind
of way I was thinking of doing so these
are a major hit I love it and I actually
love them tucked into this little high
tin for the full of white top these
white top tucked in rather I think it
looks really cute their thing is picked
up this isn't going to be a very long
haul by the way but the third thing I
picked up was this little Chloe belt bag
for no belt bags are becoming so huge
right now
and I saw this one and it literally goes
straight through your belt loops and you
can kind of keep it around your waist
let's lots of perfect for India if I'm
going shopping or from here to that it
would just be a really lovely belt back
to take around with me this is really
adorable
it's got zip okay so this is how much
room there is in here where's my phone
okay this is applause okay the plus just
fits across here I'll also be able to
get my camera in here I'll be able to
get my card wallet some lipsticks and
lip balm I think it's actually you've
got quite a good width on it at least
so yeah that's actually really really
good and then these on holes here
and then you can wear it you can wear it
as well which I thought was really nice
you can also wear it as an over shoulder
or a crossbody bag if you want to which
I really am in the like thought the main
thing you can do with this is that these
on hook like this and then you can just
belt it through should we try it
together now sits like this it goes like
this so you can hook it through like
this I really like it that is really
handy and then that extra bit of strap
I'll probably talk about into yeah took
that in the back pocket
okay I can't get rid of those no
supportive things but that is the vibe
of it that's really cool I love this
gold chain strap it just looks really
nice and I like the fact as well you can
also then use this as a little crossbody
as well it's exactly what I want to do
it's like a little belt bag perfect
yeah even just like this as a crossbody
that's really sweet isn't it that is
great really really good I mean it also
comes in a lighter blue color which I
would have kind of liked but I just
thought if I'm wearing it here all day
chance how it's gonna get quite Maki or
it's gonna be rubbing against everything
on the back of my jeans all day so this
is it crossbody
what's so adorable this gold strap is
totally as US making this pack for me
really really love it
yes and the last thing I got from betta
mom and it's a pair of shoes
I just thought these could be really
quite nice and comfortable to get around
in I really like them better mom high
tops
I was gonna say converse like the word
converse has become like an eponym for
me now
there's like the overall overarching
word for high tops I also bought the dr
ones of the kind of high tops a little
it was so wide it didn't seek me some
hope and he thought that wide when
you're actually on my feet like these
actually look so big i always say what
the right they're not as soft as a pair
of Converse ah first thing to say but
I've noticed that a lot of shoes that do
these kind of high tops faith Oh can't
even lift up my languages of my recent
workouts they're cool I mean I'm wearing
these hey with jeans but I mean I wanted
these really to go with like shorts and
little cute dresses and summer this is a
great position maybe this should be the
thumbnail do I really quite like them I
should try on the other one as well kind
of cool the best tomorrow over yeah I
kind of like them
great okay the most perfect timing ever
something just arrived from Mulberry for
my winter trip
I literally lost perfect timing during
the time I'm filming things I'm doing
you a luxury hole then I figured out to
show you guys how sweet is this this is
the brand-new will receipting I think
it's gold it's got this really cool
closure that has continued from the
previous season that's so beautiful and
this yellowy color it's almost like if I
could really deep pasteurized mustard in
a way it's like mustards it's gone that
it's a bit brighter oh I love it and
then it comes with a leather strap gold
hardware they're gonna be so cute
crossbody for the trip so now I've got
my my new belt bag and I helped this one
perfect cross body with the shorts how
nice that looks so cool how big big fan
of this of the bag off
shorts off the top I need hot just
quickly you guys may have seen this in
the vlog as well but seeing us this is
kind of it as a luxury haul thought I'd
quickly show you a few pairs of
sunglasses as well that I recently got
gifted check these out
from new Miu how cool are these this
bridge is amazing and super oversized
dial in this color big firm those Mimi's
are always so cool
then we've got Valentino's eye on assume
that some glasses look a little better
on me when I have my hair down but yeah
these are awesome
kind of similar vibes the Miu Miu but
this time in blue and slightly different
features to these I think they're
absolutely beautiful it's as Valentino's
then I have a pair of Versace which may
be my favorite off the bunch because
these are so round super oversized and
round and the final pair is a pair of
ray-bans because I am the biggest
rebound fan and I didn't have any
lettuce so these are in the pink mirror
with gold
I love these ones so it's everything
from air support at all and what's new
in right now it's very very good timing
