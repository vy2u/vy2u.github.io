welcome back to my channel or welcome
for the first time if you're brand new
pair nice to help you if you'd like to
come back again make sure you click
subscribe button just down below I'd
love to have you back for future videos
well into this video so today we're
filming and net-a-porter hall of knit a
poor take hold depending on how you like
to say it I have six pieces to show you
that I have picked up from the water a
lot of which I'll be sending back and a
few bits that I probably will keep as
well W know how much I love them
obviously this altogether cost a lot of
money but I wanted to kind of show you
the pieces on this water that I
absolutely adored the most it's going to
give you a bit of inspiration for autumn
if you're thinking of buying more kind
of pricey luxury piece the - haul isn't
to make you go buy everything or even
one thing here but just kind of give you
a bit of inspiration as the style to
really like and what I really love at
the moment on its water so like I said
don't worry I won't be keeping all of
this and see what cost
quite a lot money I'll toss it up I just
want to give you some inspiration for
some new more luxury autumn everything
I'm going to mention by the way our list
down below with links in the description
bar so everything of a linked as always
we got let's get into blue first piece
okay so this would it be a victorious
shopping trip if it wasn't all about
those w-2 Rossi's and this pair of jean
feet overseas
I have had my eye on now for quite some
time in fact absolutely ages pull that
18 months and I'm just so in love with
these face quite afternoon awesome it's
all about getting out those over knee
boots and daring to wear them in
whatever weight you feel most
comfortable I'll go for like flat boots
that are often knee hiked through a
little bit more wearable but I've always
wanted to really kill a pair of heeled
openiy boots and jump me to a Russy and
just my heel of choice generally so I've
gone for the black suede over knee boots
so have a zip Society went much easier
they've got a gorgeous to let her heel
on the back flat and a super pointy toe
as always but these are just absolutely
beautiful that
because they're so black and simple
they're extremely wearable I'm gonna be
wearing these with some sort of more
mini dress styles more top jumper
dresses that kind of vibe and just style
them up but it's absolutely killer pair
of heels absolutely amazing I also
picked out a few self-portrait pieces
because well this is me so this first of
all is a black blouse himself portray
very cool and quirky as always a
self-portrait is for the Sterling blanks
down the front and it also has this lace
of detailing around the shoulders a
little bit of ruffling to the actual
shoulder that goes down into
everything's are so different on this
this is little almost like tiny tassels
on the edge of the cuffs and around the
collar as well it's absolutely beautiful
and how stunning is this it has quite a
gothic feel to it but I feel with quite
a few lighter options more neutral
baby's tongues alongside this color will
just brighten up a little bit make it
still very optimal but not make it quite
so heavy and dark but how pretty this is
overall shape it's beautiful the next
piece is from far man and I really
wanted to try this for size see how it
looked and also because it's barmen and
it's just usually so structured and cool
in terms of its styling I just wanted to
see what it the like in this more Jersey
sweater sell format so it has the gold
kind of iconic bow man buttons that run
up the very side of the neckline got
long sleeves it's filled on the body but
I feel as soon as it stretches over me
it's gonna feel a little bit shorter
just seemed to have quite structured
shoulders as well so I'm quite excited
to try it this one it's all like and one
more piece from self-portrait is this
gorgeous cream blouse this is more of a
soft broderie anglaise style lace work a
little bit of ruffling more billowing
sleeves a little bit wider to get a
little bit more room to them and it has
a zip up the back to get you in as well
unfortunately this was sent to me in a
size 10 so I'm going to send off for a
size 6 but overall you still get a good
gist of how this looks
so you look at the size 6 I'll be able
to wear it even better really but it's
so gorgeous mom's gonna wear this with a
war
lace camisole just beneath discount
protect my dignity I think that's so
pretty
and to finish I have two beautiful back
options the first being this stealing
wine sell some Ron it smoothes black
leather with these star embellishments
all over this so they're just like
little it clear kind of diamond to gems
all over into the star shapes completely
clear smooth on the back I just
completely takes over the front with the
Y cell logo in the silver so it just a
little bit bling I don't think it's too
much embellishment it just kind of makes
that statement I feel it's the kind of
thing you go out in and people would
start talking to you about your back
it's just so statement it's so beautiful
and it also comes with a silver strap
that's why I sell and finally how
adorable is this bag this is one of the
Fendi dual baguette eggs so you have the
front little bag and then we turn over
you have the second so you're so
adorable you get kind of two bags in one
it's just such a cute little shape and
also this handle I mean how adorable is
this if you don't want to wear the strap
that is just so cute so so cute so each
one it just opens up with a little
popper so we get inside sort of thinking
kind of fit your phone into on one side
with your cash and you're the one you
could kind of fit your lipsticks and
just a bit of makeup and it's just that
really cute kind of day out bag night
out bag how sweet these little gemstones
and flowers at the salt for autumn with
a cute kind of town coat of very beige
coat this is we got standout cute look
bag and it comes with a silver chain and
a burgundy finish to the strap as well I
love it so much okay so they are the six
pieces I'm currently absolutely love
