fashion video I figured that I throw
together a video of some new pieces that
I have for the autumn seeing as autumn
is pretty much here and formally
starting around halfway through this
month I think well let's be honest it's
pretty much here already and I'm already
so excited for roll next the chunky
knitwear over knee boots my ankle boots
I think ultimately my favorite season
you just wear all the types of fashion I
absolutely love the most and you can
experiment with color a lot as well as
you guys may know I'm a little bit into
red right now I walk so I've got some
red bits in here for you I've got a lot
of lovely kind of knitwear pieces and
the mixture of luxury mid-range and also
high street so a little bit something
for everyone hopefully so I'm gonna get
in there and to show you so many things
I've picked up for the autumn and the
next few first thing I wanna show you is
this gorgeous gray knit from n Peele so
this is just a lovely Kashmir near you
may have seen me already wearing this
I'm a big fan of this kind of jumper
anything with a high neck a lovely knit
pattern I think this is almost like a
purl knit a little bit more oversized
than normal it's got a slightly
asymmetric feel and then it's longer in
the back than the front but it's just
one of those really lovely gorgeous
sweaters to throw on this is a very kind
of mid-range mid price kind of jumper so
it's not super duper inexpensive and
High Street well if you're looking for
something a little bit more special and
you love your cash minute then n peel is
definitely want to try absolutely love
it so I'm gonna be getting a lot of wear
out of this over at the autumn knife for
sure I am so in love with this guy I
can't even describe this is a Jonathan
Simkin skirt but it's up from far fetch
fetch I need to go on far fetch more
because they do so many incredible
pieces I love the fact that quite often
they'll have things on there that are
often sold out elsewhere because they're
coming from lots of different stores and
everything's kind of delivered from
different stores there's a really cool
concept anyway so I found this on there
order myself this and I'm absolutely in
love with this it's beautiful long
length very delicate towards the lower
edge here yeah it's almost frayed the
edging gorgeous lace and then there's
this mini
insert here it keeps well covered up to
right here and the lace that comes up
and more see-through at the bottom but
it's just absolutely stunning and you
can swear in so many different ways I
wearing this with a pair of Malone's new
year ankle boots I have because easily
wear this would just like slightly
longer ankle boots over knee boots if
you wanted to something more slouchy or
even just flat shoes or stilettos it's
just can work into your art and wardrobe
however you like plus with the different
colors that are in this you could wear a
burgundy knit a black knit a baby blue
knit a gray knit a widened it you know
you can kind of like pair it up I mean I
say knit because I like the idea of it
being lacy and then chunky you can stop
do with it as you will but love that so
much going more towards the high street
H&amp;amp;M studio are releasing their new
collection I think in next week and I
got this just before it's come out and
it's this beautiful very cool it's just
like a sleeveless throw over roll neck
jumper and I really love this detail
around the bottom it's like a satin
ribbon around the edge with these cool
ties it's just very very cool I mean you
could wear this over a white shirt and
just have like the arms the white shirt
coming through you could just wear it
like this with a very cool bra
underneath it in fact it'll bring the
brown with me they have an absolutely
gorgeous black bra as well this season
in the studio line and it's amazing and
you can just wear that underneath and it
looks incredible
yeah so I'm really excited to wear this
in a few different types of ways even
just by over tee shirts it's like
throwing it on it'll look really really
cute
also if you missed my vlog I vlogged my
trip to Poland the other day and I
showed quite a few new pieces from
reserved which is like a Polish very
Eastern European brand but they're
moving into the UK on the sick so in two
days so who doesn't see that vlog
already I will leave it linked on the
screen so you can go screen the screen
so you can go watch it but this is my
favourite piece from reserved and it's
so perfect for this season it's just a
really lovely long line jet really yeah
I guess it is a jacket it's more of a
jumper jacket feel it's got going
shilling inside it's so cozy and comfy
and I really love the grammar I mean I'm
a big fan of Grima so it's a really
lovely throw on a jacket jumper but I
think for when the weather's starting to
get a little bit cooler
it'll be amazing just to throw this on
and feel super cozy so I thought I'd
mention that as well
that's super affordable too now this
isn't
chemically or toner but I wanted to
mention it because you're gonna be
seeing a lot more of this when I head to
airports into Airport pictures but the
brand new Ted Baker cakes is a file a
lot I've been so excited for these to
launch this is already a bit bashed up
I'm really gutted I was in a cab with
the day off in the airport and cab
driver open up the boot and it fell out
the boot on to the floor and scratch all
around the edge of here but it's still
an amazing small size this is the one
that you can take onto the plane it's
your cabin luggage every single plane
that I've been on it's been absolutely
fine to the size but I can hold so much
you're nice I love them just wanted to
mention it because I'm very very excited
about these cases let me into my legs
and the colors in them and style is
quite autumnal in lovely okay another
piece of knitwear that I'm really
looking forward to start wearing is this
one which again I got from far-fetched
and this is from a Victoria Beckham this
is just a very beautiful it feels
incredible a piece of knitwear with
ribbing through the net
all the way through ribbing changes
direction over the sleeves and then once
again on the very coughs it's quite a
long jumper this one so it's kind of
thing that I almost want to throw on
with a really cute pair of maybe shorts
just underneath poking through and ankle
boots
and maybe some lace shorts could be
super cute to kind of mix up the
textures I'm heaviness of the fabrics
just with some gorgeous over nice suede
boots would look beautiful and also red
would look great I love navy with red
right now another gorgeous piece if
you're looking for something bit more in
the luxury categories for the season and
a key piece I absolutely adore this and
I'm just so excited to get wearing it
when it comes to red and my obsession
with red I don't know if you saw these
of the day on my Instagram and might
interest stories these aren't going to
be for everyone a lot of people will
look at these and think oh my goodness
they are so pointy quite high but that's
why I love them they're just that ultra
statement shoe absolutely doll Eve I've
been a big fan of the Balenciaga boots
now for the last few seasons that have
been doing this kind of style with the
knife point toe and when I saw them in
the red I kind of couldn't resist in my
a that's all I mentioned I wanted a pair
of red boots and let's just say that I
found the red boots
of dreams I'm honestly it's so smitten
these were full leather the heel I think
is about four inches not too much at all
I mean the toe I mean my toes come to
about here and also in you've got this
hole
as well so it's very much about the
statements about the style if you have
the confidence to rock it and you want
to just be like a lot of these boots I
want to rock them in my own way but also
just go for it play with color play with
different shapes and silhouettes and
just be a bit more experimental and
that's how I felt with these and I felt
really confident in them I love them to
pieces but if you're not feeling the red
but you love the boots let's just say
blender yoga also released the sock boot
as well the sock boot trend has been
pretty big now for the past few seasons
and there's been a lot of like
duplicates on the market these are the
gorgeous knife boot Balenciaga
in the sock material again it won't be
for everybody my best friend isn't a fan
of these but I absolutely love them I
just think they're gonna go with so many
different things crop trousers still
mini but long length mini dresses
sweater dresses will look amazing with
these skirts really cute lacy dresses
and just to add that bit more contrast
yeah I'm a big big fan so if you do love
to blow this yoga boots a season and you
not quite sure I brought the round
you're not quite sure about the red then
the black could be the one for you but
I'd kind of get on it quick because
these bad boys are selling like hotcakes
so I'll leave a couple links down below
we can still get them sorry guys I'm
gonna mention another net but it is an
absolutely gorgeous one this is a long
length cream very thick woolly knit and
this is very cute the way this rolls
down yeah around the neck sorry I keep
looking here coz I'm just checking it's
actually on screen that you can see me
that it's in focus it's quite difficult
sometimes when you film your own to make
sure that everything's working so if you
remember looking over here
it's because that's where my screen is
I'm just checking everything it's going
to play anyway so this again is from the
HTM studio collection which again
launches like next week but she's so
super chunky very warm and very autumnal
into winter style especially in the
cream it's very wintery but it's
absolutely beautiful yes really wanted
to mention it I think this is about 70
pound when it launches the other one the
black one that's like 1999 which is
pretty amazing so yeah pretty excited to
get wearing that in my collection now if
you look up wall on me and the very very
last thing to mention which I'm so
excited about was an incredible gift
that I received from coach and it's a
brand new coach Selena Gomez back again
in red I got this because I wanted to
wear it with my
oops obviously so that I have matching
accessories does anyone do that anymore
because I kind of want to be that person
who has a matching red back to their
boots
I'm absolutely smitten with it I'm just
so so grateful to coach the feminists
such incredible piece it has this long
straps you can wear it crossbody if you
like but it also has have a come off by
the way but it also has two handles I
love the fact that it's these they've
two big posts on either side opposite
the zip comes completely apart if you
did want to get into it fully like this
am I still laughing okay and it's a
gorgeous burgundy just on the inside I
feel this bug though is gonna become one
of the it backs of the season so I'm
pretty excited that I've got a very
autumnal shade I'm gonna get a lot of
wear out this and it's absolutely
beautiful
I also have this little charm that says
coach Times Selena Gomez on it so I
think that a lot the Selena Gomez fans I
go and talk to oh that's cute do we
didn't see that I also got a little tag
that got Selena Gomez's signature on
there so any Selena fans will adore this
bag I'm absolutely sure it's just really
really stunning and very art or not and
I think that's it when it comes to this
haul those were some uh newest things
that I've picked up recently well in the
past like six weeks or so that I haven't
shown you so I wanted to kind of round
it all up I like to kind of show you
