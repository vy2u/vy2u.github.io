well I really wanted to film another
luxury haul for you this time based
around new handbags and I've got a
couple that I'm really excited to show
you one big big big splurge that I've
been thinking about buying for a year or
so or since they were released up sure
so it's been quite a while so that's a
big splurge but it's quite a few other
beautiful bags here I really really
wanted to share so let's just get right
into it so this week is on a fashion
week and last week was New York Fashion
Week
and June New York Rebecca Minkoff showed
and she settled all the chairs and the
whole runway through the middle of Soho
outside apparently I was not there I
wish I was her anyway so I really really
love what Rebecca Minkoff doors and the
moment she has a new collection is out
and her team asked if I would like one
of her new pieces and of course I was
absolutely over the moon so they sent me
this absolutely beautiful bag in a black
smooth leather it's got these cool
little tassels hanging off of here in
different colors so it's kind of on
those bags you could wear with all black
and just have this little pop of color I
could wear it with a couple of the
different shades so you can see in these
tassels I really like about it and it's
got a really thin but long strap so you
could wear it crossbody you could just
hold it as a clutch because these come
off quite easy so it could just be nice
little clutch so I feel it's quite a
versatile bag I think it's a super cute
it's also for a kind of design it bag
it's of the market affordable end as
well which is fantastic I think it's
something to get a lot of use out of as
well especially for my evenings out or
date nights or nights first when I kind
of go to maybe like a bar with a lot of
my girlfriend's drinks and things like
that they can the perfect bag for that
so throw your keys you throw your
lipstick isn't it lovely though
the next bag I don't think I think we've
shown you yet although I've had it for
quite a few months and it is just
beautiful augury bag I always say
Bulgari
I think it sounds even more
call an exotic but I think it is
actually
Bulgari you might know them well because
they quite often use the iconic kind of
snake snake print or snake emblems in
this in the way that they create their
jewelry and also now in their handbags
so this is a Bulgari 70 forever bag and
this is in the Royal sapphire blue so
it's a gorgeous like metallic shiny
stunning leather and just absolutely in
love with the whole kind of stitching
work and it's little sections all over
the whole design it's just really
classic unlike any other bag that I have
especially with it being companies pay
to the metallic and then when you open
up inside its it's quite good amount of
space I think if everything I need to in
here keys wallet the chain is almost
like a silvered gold shade and all the
way down it's almost like a snake print
metalwork I don't know how I've done
this with so beautiful and also just
kind of works with the whole theme of
the back in the back it says we'll do it
really simply there as well but I mean
this help you close up it I think mine
is a little bit of polish actually bring
out super showing again but it's just so
stunning okay the next part to show you
you may have already seen in my
collaboration with Patricia where we're
going through what we are wearing for
Fashion Week and I mentioned this law
nutbag I remember the first time I saw
these I was walking through Selfridges
and we have something like a patent baby
pink and he was so beautiful especially
with the gold work on there because
Laura is kind of known for having this
beautiful the beautiful gold icon and a
little bits of hardware in this gold
shade and it was the most beautiful
little bag I remember going over to her
looking at it and it was just so
beautiful I totally fell in love this
whole brand and then I realized this is
the brand the queen love so this is like
the Queen's favorite brand like quite
often if you see pictures of the Queen
she will have a lot of bag so it's kind
of like a royal kind of feel to it I
feel the whole styling of this bag is
just so it does feel quite regal the
whole cut of it everything is very good
straight line it's very robust
it's made it's just a really strong
shape of role in fact a healthy gold
sections to each side a little bit and
then you just pop this up and open
I still go it's tough just keep the
shape nice but there's loads of room and
sounds F everything that you need and it
also comes with a shoulder strap as well
so if you did want to wear it across
your body I think again it kind of it
would reduce how elegant and classic
this bag look so if you want to kind of
wear it your own way make it a bit more
chic or cool styled then I think that
kind of cross body will work nicely I
think I might try and do that otherwise
I would just wear it without the strap
and just kind of hold it by the handle
it's just so beautiful but it's just so
pretty I love it and finally my big big
splurge of the month a lot of you will
have seen this on snapchat if you don't
follow me on snapchat already you should
do kiss now and again I put up kind of
like sneak peeks and where I'm shopping
and we kind of a heads up for what's
going on
so I finally bought the deal derailleur
back in medium in this incredible shade
of almost like raspberry oxblood
goodness it's almost like a burgundy mix
with ox blood mixed with a raspberry to
create its color and I walked into the
other day just kind of public around and
asked to get my watch cleaned and I saw
this bag
straightaway I was like oh my goodness
it wasn't this one it was like a it was
a larger version the larger version that
they have and I had never seen this cool
before totally fell in love with it but
was like I really want it in the medium
anyway they tracked it down there was
one left in the world apparently that
hasn't yet been sold in Italy and they
brought it all the way from Italy for me
so I could buy it which is absolutely
amazing which is incredible customer
service almost to the fact that I was a
blogger didn't come into it I was just
literally a customer buying bag and it
was so wonderful to me and they brought
it over for me so I could get it I'm so
so pleased it's just so beautiful and so
it just sort of pushes in the lock of
open side
just says Christian Dior here on the
inside I still got a rap inside it but
then it's like this baby blue finish to
the inside and almost like a satin I
think it's the same fabric that they
create their ribbons in on the inside
how pretty I'm just absolutely in love
with it I'm still not really once and
touching it I only got yesterday so this
is kind of brand new I've not worn it
out yet but the silver hardware me now a
sucker for silver silver is my favorite
so the fact it has silver hardware was
the selling point for me I know that so
many of you are tweeting me after I saw
the original bag and I like you have to
get it honestly it's just incredible so
thank you to all you people you really
really do persuade me so thank you yes I
hope you like it I'm so in love with it
