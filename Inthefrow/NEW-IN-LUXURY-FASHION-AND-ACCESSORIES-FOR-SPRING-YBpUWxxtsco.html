if you're brand new to the channel would
be amazing if you subscribed and joined
and came back for the next one so
getting into this video this is going to
be a new in luxury items video it has
just been the fashion months it's
finally over for me for weeks off
incredible shows amazing designers lots
of inspiration and a hell of a lot of
outfits I didn't actually go to Milan
the season because I went to LA for an
incredible project with Vita Liberata
selves actually in LA instead of Milan
but again for me it's still four
different cities I would spend a lot of
time in and I had lots of outfits for so
I picked up some new items I was gifted
some new items I bought some new
clothing with discount code so I've just
bundled up a few things together here
mainly for the spring and you may have
seen them on my vlogs on all the videos
in my Instagram post and I quite like
these videos just around of everything
that I have collected together in the
past few months plus you guys seem to
like these videos a lot just to give you
an idea of what is in the stores right
now and what you may be inspired by so
let's just kick this right off first
thing new to my collection
is this super soft and guess it's
probably cashmere scarf from Burberry
the Burberry Beauty team so kindly sent
me this as a gift as literally wrap a
trellis took it in with a big jacket a
big camel coat a big black coat and it
looks amazing I've never had a scarf in
this shape before in this it's almost
like a big triangular shape it's so
thick and soft it's seriously stunning I
do have another berry scarf but I must
admit this has muscley taking its place
in terms of my favorite scarf
yeah and I'm super excited to get
wearing this and know that it's nearly
spring but at the moment in London it's
extremely cold it's gonna be a little
while until we can stop wearing all of
our really warm accessories so I'm quite
excited about wearing this while sits at
the top of the pile if they're also from
Burberry you may have seen that I wore
these full under Fashion Week for the
Burberry show I picked these up to go
along to show in and I'm absolutely
obsessed with them these are just a pair
of tapered trousers in a very statement
very recognizable Burberry print flag
patterning and I've got a bright blue a
yellow a green and of course the red so
there's a lot going on here but they fit
like a dream
you really fit so flattering like shit's
like super peachy bomb a really tapered
legs and I just felt really lovely in
these I think the kind of thing you
could wear with so many items like black
oversized knit whitey tucked in camisole
Roenick so many things so I cannot wait
to get wearing these much more
prepare to be seeing me wearing these a
lot over the next few months I could not
do this video without mentioning my own
collaboration range with stress right as
this was a premium luxury launch as well
if you didn't see that video or my you
discover everything else I'm not too
sure where you have been guys it was so
exciting for me the amount of times I
found you guys on insta stories
squirming everywhere else I'd be a
little surprised if you haven't yet
heard about this but it is my
collaboration range that I created with
strawberry we came up with accessories
and bags in my own curated colorways and
hardware styles and also we did pouches
and we did card wallets as well
Strasberg in fro there are still at this
time I'm filming this a week in advance
so I'm so sorry for now sold out but at
this point the pouches and the card
holders are still in stock there is it a
small pouch and a larger pouch this one
fits your iPhone 8 plus plus they're a
few of the bits and this pouch is
perfect you know just for cards keys
spare change
anything that's really small but you
want to kind of keep together more safe
and sound inside your bag and of course
the card holders I only use card holders
now I don't use purses so I had to bring
out a card holder and I'm obsessed with
it the quality is divine it's absolutely
gorgeous the way it's made and I'm a
seen a few you guys tweeting me and
sending with pictures and info stories
of your items and how you found them and
I'm literally so proud I'm over the moon
so thank you so much makes it such a
success guys let's talk about pair of
shoes shall we okay a new pair of shoes
to my collection are these from aqua
Sara these are so me black very high
pointed heels with well I mean this case
so these have a peep toe I haven't
bought a peep toe heel in a little while
but I'm a big big fan of them I think
this is really really flattering but
these in a gorgeous suede the cutout
details can you see I feel like ants
that's very well because it's got the
suede little panels cut out details and
through the front cut out details as
well this is a really beautiful pair of
boot heels and I think I'm gonna get a
hell of a lot of wear out of these going
forward for evening dudes just for in
the day I mean I wear heels in the day
it isn't usual for me to wear something
like this just to go for meetings and
things like that in the city so I'm
gonna get a lot of wear out of those
another clothing item I wanted to
mention that I wore in New York and I
also wore it in Paris as well and it's
this dress from Rick so the print is
just really cool and quirky fun quite
unusual for me to go for something
that's a little bit more I don't know
more cartoony in a way like this but I
just really really loved it the style
the fit of this is so flattering the low
v-neck makes it not overly sexy but
still really feminine and beautiful on
and in the long leg for the slits again
just gives it a bit more of a sexy feel
and in fact the other day it was so
called in Paris that wore this over a
pair of leather trousers and at first I
was like I'm gonna take off a leather
trousers cuz I think it looks a bit
silly but actually over over the day
I'll say actually I really really liked
the way it worked underneath the skirt
because it skirt is so it's quite long
it's black and then with a black pair of
leather trousers you couldn't really
tell they were there but if the slips
open then you know you weren't freezing
cold and I really quite liked that
anyway thought I'd mention it cuz I
think it's an absolutely beautiful dress
I have a new bag to my collection guys I
feel like it's been a little while since
I treated myself to a new bag but this
is part of the new Anya Hindmarch
chubby hearts collection bags they
launched little campaign over Fashion
Week where they had big chubby hearts
are all around the city just to promote
the whole campaign and this is one of
the bags from the line the whole idea is
it's all quilted with these pocket
sections it just reminds you of a big
quilted sofa but the material is really
soft and beautiful and and even this the
way that the strap goes into this very
padded quilted section for on your
shoulder it's really really like it like
crossbody it just looks like a little
barrel I think it's great I wore this
for Paris quite a few times really loved
it another pair of heels I actually had
to get I wanted a pair of these last
season but I was like can I really pull
these off they are a little bit
but unique term but I saw they'd come
out again this time in this colorway now
these will not be to everybody's taste
at all they are very unusual these
repair of Fendi boots but it was this
colorway in this it's almost like a
charcoal black gray
it's a litter material pink this is like
a baby pink stripe and then the striped
heel it very much reminds you about
Alice in Wonderland plus it has a
rounded toe which is not me at all but I
kept seeing these everywhere and seen
people style them and thought actually
that they're actually really cute and
really cool and statement pair of boots
and you know how I feel about boots I
wear boots every day and I thought you
know what it's not gonna harm me to add
these in my collection because I feel
like I'm going to get a lot of wear out
them and I wore in Paris with a full
Kenzo outfit that I wore and really
loved them and I got loads of
compliments on them I just think they're
really quirky so love I hate them I'd
love to know what you think down below
let me know if you love these I hate
these but yeah really cool pair of boots
this is uber luxurious and I don't think
I've mentioned it properly in a sit-down
video yet but it's my bow my blazer blue
clay fabric this is just beautiful and I
wore this for the Bauman's show I've
worn it quite a few times over the past
few weeks because why would I not get my
wear out of this I saw it on the website
and straight away fell for it I had to
get it but I'd been looking for the
perfect white blazer for a while and the
felt it was Balaban and knew it would
fit me really really well I went for the
34 this I always get the 34 in the
bombing so I feel it helps you feel a
bit more on the petite side of your size
so this fits really really well I also
got the matching skirt which I'll leave
a link to down below I've not shown it's
a feel like I've shown it quite a lot
already but yeah I got the matching
skirt for this because I am obsessed in
my suits right now and I knew that if
one or the other sold out and I didn't
manage to get the matching suit then I'd
be a little bit disappointed so I went
for both it was a big investment but
it's honestly a matching suit that I
will keep for years and years and years
like 20 years time I'm still gonna be
wearing this I was a little bit worried
about the white fabric and like for
example first time I wore this it was
for my meet and greet in Manchester with
Google and obviously I was hugging
everyone cuz I like to hug people and
this side of my shoulder where people
had hope they had so much makeup on it
well actually it's all managed to come
out I got some that vanished stuff that
you rub on everything and it's all come
out perfectly so really really please it
does need a bit of a clean now they're
out there is more makeup on the inside
of this I'll do it soon but because I
was wearing that in Paris to go with it
I actually bought myself the bomb and
t-shirt as well just because I needed
something to wear underneath the jacket
with the skirt and because it was a bomb
on show I thought that I wanted to go
fully kitted out Batman
I'd always had my eye on the white tee
and especially when I saw it also came
with the gold buttons
I was totally sold and I was thought you
know what I wear white t-shirts so much
I mean I'm wearing one right now this
too should part of this video because it
is brand new to my collection and as far
as white t-shirts go it's definitely on
the luxury side this was almost twice
surprised actually of this Belmonte but
I have already worn this 25 plus times
I'm a little bit obsessed with it it now
needs a clean because I've just worn it
over the top of you till about a body
blur that I've got on right here
now it's slightly stained so back to
this t-shirt yeah I bought this one and
I love the gold foil print I'll be able
to wear this with shorts and jeans and
trousers
you know it'll go with so many things it
is just so neutral but it has got a
little bit of a statement on there I
don't often love things that are too
overly branded into logo heavy but I
think I just really liked it it's really
liked it so I added that to my
collection too and just two more pairs
of shoes
these boots if you saw my company who
take where else with this once and it
was only afterwards when I was editing
the picture that I realized how much
these literally look like a pair of
swarms when you stood next response like
the yellow and the black beak and then
the white body it can't it blew me away
when I realized when I was editing and
Alex society err did you not notice like
no this is great so it's not the perfect
picture opportunity without even
realizing it and these are a pair from
Malone Suez they're very different to my
other over me boots they're a bit wider
in their style and they just look really
cool over jeans or over leather trousers
it looked really cool and these are also
in sale but I think they've been out for
a few months now potentially so they're
also in sale but I think for spring
leave like the perfect spring over new
boots
imagine this was like a cute - little
fitted mini dress are even more floaty
mini dress
very cool I like those a lot and the
last pair of shoes I wanted to mention
that I will be taking away on my
holidays they're coming up soon and it's
a new pair of Valentino sandals if you
know my content quite well but you'll
know that I have a pair of Valentino
sandals very similar to this and I've
worn them in so much now but pretty much
most of the leather has come off here
and down the actual sole and it's
because they were completely flat
whereas Valentino just brought these out
with this roping around the side and
more of a thicker sole to them they're
much more robust and the last one size
for sure it was literally almost like a
piece of cardboard but I love them apps
I love them whereas these ones so much
thicker much more comfortable resilient
you know I'll be able to wear these so
much more and I thought I'm gonna get so
much wear out of these for every single
trip I have coming up they're so
comfortable you don't have a toe post it
just goes straight over your thoughts
you not got anything rubbing you these
don't rub you because they also nicely
and look how cute they are
this roping they're just so exquisite I
love them I couldn't wait to wear these
so I got pair of those as well for money
every read this is quite a lot there
those are all of the items I've recently
picked up with more sort of luxury
premium categories very very excite to
style ease up for the coming months very
excited for London to get a little bit
warmer I must admit it's very very cold
I'm a little bit sick of having my
heating on all the time but I'm really
looking forward to spring fashion and
mixing up my Styles the will be a style
remix on the way by the way there really
will be it just takes me a lot longer to
film and I've had no days full days at
home yet to do it so that's why I
thought I'd film us today it's like a
