the first time if you're brand new to my
channel my name is Victoria this is my
channel in the fro that's how you
pronounce it by the way you know what
let's just have a little classification
here it's pretty well in real life in
the fro means in the front row fro in
terms often used to describe different
row just got to clear that up again
sometimes since I mentioned it anyway so
for the video I decided that today I'll
just go through some Newman pieces that
I've got holidays and for summer more in
the luxury designer categories and when
I got looking actually I've got quite a
lot of new things so instead I've
whittled it down and this video is going
to be based on accessories so bags and
shoes so these are all a different
luxury designer bags and shoes that I
picked up in the past for over six
months or some things I've not really
shown you as much and I thought I would
show you I don't want to call this a
hole because in honesty looking back in
my old videos when I used to look
through holes it's very unrealistic no
one can really haul lots of items at the
same time and although I didn't do that
and it was always spaced out I don't
wanna give the impression that I am
someone that can go out buy in bulk
designer purchases because let's be
honest and last year prince or princess
you can't really do that I'm very lucky
as a fashion blogger and that I work
with a lot of brands some brands getting
bounces or was giving me discount and
that means I can buy a lot more products
and more items than someone who isn't a
blogger could do so I completely
understand if it may come across as
unrealistic or some people like you've
got more money than sense I've had that
comment before but that's because it
looks like I've gone out spent loads of
my own money when in fact a brand has
helped me can pick up some new pieces I
can see chat my Instagram or I can
feature my blog post just to kind of
create more content really so let's just
get right into it and I will show you
why I picked it recently that I'm very
excited about especially for the summer
and for some holidays that I have coming
up let's start off with some shoes first
shoes on the list are pet sandals either
probe aquaszero sandals from money 4s
there are beautiful very royal blue
suede the pretty pom-pom on the top is
very familiar factor and they often come
out with pom-poms designs this works
really nicely for the season and of
course it laces up the ankles as well
these little tassels they're very pretty
there a statement sleeve shoe they can
just kind of add some line since we'll
call it into any ordinary outfit and a
screen wearing these for denim shorts
some jeans and you know just adds that
little pop of color and they're actually
extremely comfortable as well I did a
full day walking around Florence in
these and I love the fact that aqua Zara
is a Florence brand so even better kind
of continuing with that category a very
holiday based shoes I have a pair from
Tommy Hilfiger how beautiful these
colors literally stood out to me
straightaway when I saw them in the
store a few weeks back I loved this
ribbon effect this plotted ribbon effect
around the heel and of course it goes
across the front and again I don't
really have anything in this kind of
course scheme especially not this cool
scheme as a whole but the yellow
specifically I don't have anything in
yellow and I loved these I when I first
got going I thought there are great pair
of shoes will I really get the use out
of them because they're a little bit
more stark and statement exciting and
you know are I've worn these quite a lot
already
especially in Florence among my peers a
trip you may have seen some pictures on
my Instagram already these were
fantastic for putting red dark blues
with blacks with light blues in fact me
which any color that you see here in
this shoe you could wear this with a
little of them that's very comfortable
so the only pair of wedges I over the
only pair and I'm very very pleased to
have them here I am extremely excited
about our pair of new Valentino's you
know me very well you know I have this
colored powder pink color in heel
version and they are battered and
bruised and my most I'd either say my
most worn pair of shoes ever so when I
saw they brought them out and sandal
form and especially with a full band
across the toes
rather than 800 slow over Kyle tippet
yeah I hate her both they don't work
well with my toes so I like to get
sandals that go straight across because
they don't look in the same in fact they
do there is version that does have toe
posts if you prefer that but these are
the ones that go right across the top of
your foot and they fit wonderfully I
have these in my normal size and if I
for these are size 4 different if you
wondering they're very comfortable it's
great it's the literal exact same style
shape
as the heels and it goes around top of
your ankle around the back of foot as
well and it has a few sections focused
off your feet but these are some
standard form these are going to be my
go-to I think for the entirety of summer
we've got a trip coming up next week to
Sri Lanka and the Maldives oh my god I'm
so excited just for the pictures so yes
so make sure if you're not already
pleased to follow me on Instagram I'm
just in the throw on Instagram I'd love
to have you over there I'll be putting
all of my outfits and pretty much
everything all of my outfits is always
shot the ball and of a link in my
Instagram which is in the photo calm
/the looks and it's always got my
outfits on they're usually right before
I post them so you can shop them right
away just go to waste
I love little boom so these going to
probably be my most worn pair of shoes
ever you'll sees everywhere so watch
helpless okay move into heels oh my god
oh my god oh my god these potentially
are my most favorite pair of heels have
ever bought ever oh these are a pair of
dolce gabbana heels with an incredible
pointed toe of course you know me a
wonderful heel this is probably about a
1/3 for you it's about three and a half
inch heel so nothing too hard to put you
off walk on them I can just hear Alex
move to me my coffee making thing like
such a brilliant and when I order them
off the website I knew they were going
to be beautiful and colorful and
incredible but I don't even really
realize what fabric would be and in fact
these are a patent it's almost like a
vinyl Payton fabric I love even more it
means they're not girly kind of wear the
same I'll be able to wipe them clean if
I need to I have to be careful
scratching them and piercings they sort
of fabric but it actually feels pretty
robust and I'm pretty strong so I think
they'll do pretty well actually
and in love with these I've got them the
same size as always size 37 which is my
size 4 and they are a dream country here
see another pair of heels that I'm very
very excited about all I can hear is
coffee making in the other room
gosh cannot go silent Thursdays okay
back to this back to this okay this pair
of shoes you probably seen a lot of
different instagrams by now but I adored
them as soon as I saw them and they were
sold out everywhere luckily I know a
very nice guy who works at Dior
I have his number now cuz I go in there
that often mean you know I looked you up
there if anything I ever see I can text
in the site if you ever get this in
please let me know through maybe they're
handicapped so I got that I hid a lot of
that look at these shoes and first I was
going to get it in the black they do
come in a black becoming a black fabric
and then they come in noot patent and at
first I really wanted to black because
my good friend Omar Epps has this exact
shoes but they also come in two
different heel sizes so tomorrow has a
smaller kitten heel shoe but I'm not
really getting heel kind of gal so I
wanted the taller shoe which i think is
about 10 centimeters tall overall so I
wanted these ones now on to the black
but the black tech commend these came in
and in fact I realize that news goes
with everything and I'll be able to get
the much more aware of these on the
black I mean that's that's a long boring
story about these shoes and so happy
with them they are wonderful these were
a big splurge and quite frankly I loved
your and I'm happy to spend my
hard-earned cash on a new pair of your
shoes every now and again so I'm in love
with these beautiful fabric trim with
shoddy or around the edge can you see
that yet around the edge a little bow
here
slingbacks can't fail him on that I am
in wolf and the last pair of heels I've
got to say there's no heels in this book
yet two pair of flat sandals to let me
off the last pair of heels here Oh ng
could you ever see a boot that suits my
taste more than these boots I realized I
own quite a lot of boots in this very
similar style at the toy line call in a
black with a very cool heel we're very
pointed to however these are new from
Fatima
and I saw this exact pair of boots and
parents when out of my L'Oreal beauty
squad and Kosh and Emily and L'Oreal
team and we tried them on and everyone's
like you have to get them you have to
get them but I've never really seen them
fall and I was like this is
it's a big splurge to go for if I'm not
too sure anyway
couldn't find them anywhere and they've
just come online on the reason he Romo I
leave a link down below the cool thing
about the novice Lee is this reflector
heel it's very statement it's very
different it's very unusual some of you
apologize some of you probably love it
the ones that love it I know what you
mean aren't they also know and I realize
they're quite a kind of sick junkie boot
for spring summer vibes but let's be
honest London doesn't get all that hot
maybe for a month or so but back into
the camera and wearing them after that
up until that point but up until then
these just scream sexy killer boots
totally diggin aids let's finish this
little collection off then with some
back where do I start
oh okay for our new style from Valentina
at least I think it is I'm pretty sure I
haven't seen it anywhere until recently
I got this new little Valentina for
money Fred it's a very sky-blue my past
alive
gold hardware I love the way the strap
goes up either side like this I'm the
only running on it but it's on the very
very back so in fact from the front you
probably wouldn't even realize this
rather daunting now but I'm pretty
smitten with it I've worn it a lot so
far lots of space inside keys in there
things like a little bit others an
inside pocket so lots of room your bits
and bobs yeah we sit walls to wedding
I've worn it all the way around Florence
big big fan of this it's a kind of
fabric where you can't really scratch it
too easily either so gonna get a lot of
wear out of it
beautiful bag another thing I wanted to
mention again just pick up on a super
cell phone on it and I love it too bit
is my new little Chanel I think it's a
flat bag it's like the new South flap
bag why does it have makeup right just
how to makeup on it never mind I'll live
with a top panel I think it's a bag
with top hound-dog so how's this little
handle on top it's all very champagne
gold it's not very very gold so in fact
I have this inside as well how produces
so I went away with the Chanel team and
they bought us all a little card wallet
I think it's like a card wallet you
could put it easily fits the Chanel it
must in here which is perfect it's a
very cute little card holder wallet mini
purse it's very very cute I've got
inside there but it's a more of a
champagne gold shade to the hardware
a course lever to the very top you just
been very sophisticated an elegant back
very pretty probably wouldn't be for
everyone but I just thought it was very
cute and very sweet and I've actually
used it a lot so far I thought I'd be a
little bit worried about wearing it
because it is cream and it could
potentially get damaged but and just
like Yolo I've not bought this to be set
on my shelf I'm gonna wear it and I'm
going to look after it and a hat very
very last piece to show you this has
gone on a little bit longer than I
anticipated I'm very very sorry but I
have to show you this as well a new
dotting cabana cloth sack just picked up
from the reeds of Via Roma how beautiful
is this I'm totally lovely dashing about
it again
this season they just kill every single
season I mean these are a must-have but
then I saw this as well and it's just so
beautiful it almost looks like it's been
hand-painted I realize it probably
hasn't if it has then blimey that's
incredible and on the back it's just
very pretty everyone everyone I'm
showing to see so far in fact that means
four stories and I can't tell you how
many people message me to like wow your
new bag is incredible it's so pretty I
love the fact it's like a lock it's
almost like a little padlock here with a
pretty flower on it and you open the key
and it opens a padlock a very sweet
design just in here it says Dolce &amp;amp;
Gabbana in this grip to the front I've
not worn this yet it's what you got all
the lovely lights from these sections
inside it the inside is black and white
polka-dot
oh I just love it I can't tell you how
beautiful this is and I honestly think
so many people if you're looking for
loving a clutch and you want something a
bit more statement perfect kind of
wedding season as well for interment
weddings for spring/summer for black
dresses blue dresses if something very
simple and want a little statement bag I
thinks is going to be a very popular
Barker season I will be surprised with
you start seeing this everywhere
