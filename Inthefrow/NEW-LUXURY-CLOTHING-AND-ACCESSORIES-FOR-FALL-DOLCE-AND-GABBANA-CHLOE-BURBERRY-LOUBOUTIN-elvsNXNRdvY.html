are brand-new for the first time now and
again I love to throw in these kind of
luxury new in items videos just because
I feel they're quite inspiring for the
new seasons there's a lot of times
especially recently where I've just felt
like so uninspired so uninterested in
the newest trends or the new fashions or
new pieces that are new in I just go
through these rocks where I'm like I
don't know what to buy or what it's like
the new end thing that I really would
like in my wardrobe so I like when these
videos together for you guys who want to
invest in something gorgeous that will
really kind of enhance your wardrobe
potentially we're not too sure what to
buy or how to style it just for the
disclaimer to get that out there some of
these pieces were bought with my own
money
others were bought with discount codes
others were bought with vouchers others
were gifted to me just for complete
transparency
on this but I love watching these videos
I love seeing all the new luxury premium
pieces that people have in their
wardrobe for different seasons and over
the last few weeks I've been picking up
a few new items for upcoming travels and
trips and obviously the new season so I
wanted to share these with you so let's
let's get right into this
okay a new back to my collection you may
have seen this if you watch my vlogs
hello if you watched my vlogs as well
this is one of the Burberry dk8
a bags they are sort of brand new to the
Berber line and the idea with these is
that you can kind of customize them and
create your own bag style I had like a
little booklet I went through to choose
time for materials all of that and this
is what I thought would be kind of cool
in honesty I didn't know this would be
like a metallic laminated fabric but I
actually really really love it I know a
few of you guys is from my vlog some of
you loved it some of you really don't
like it that's totally cool it's all up
for personal opinion it's totally fine
if you're not really into it I know my
mom said that she saw a picture of me
and didn't like it and then when she
came over she actually loved it what she
saw in person this is like my favorite
color and this kind of pink is one of my
favorite colors too so I wanted to kind
of create a bag like this and Burberry
gave me the opportunity to do that so
very very cool and I think it said
pretty awesome bag it pushes down opens
up and it is huge inside and I also
created this with the same pink
as well but if you're not really one for
laminated leather it does come in
gorgeous kind of matte leathers and lo
these different colors it's just a very
cool bag for this season some new shoes
into my wardrobe guys and I haven't even
worn these yet I cannot actually wait
these are a pair of Louboutins soccer
boots style now I did have the blintz
Yaga's and I wore there maybe three
times and found that they completely
laddered the actual fabric I thought it
would be more hard wearing than it was
it was really not so if you're thinking
of buying them I would honestly
recommend you do not I loved them I love
the style
I loved how many things they went with
their incredible boot they're just not
that robust in terms of the fabric so in
the end I did end up sending my back
because I was not amazed by the overall
material and then I found these I mean I
love Louboutin anyway it looks pale here
by the way so how they have an insert
inside it to keep its shape which is
white otherwise I love it it doesn't
come quite as high as a Balenciaga but
this is like a thick sock material this
is not gonna ladder while I hope not
it's gonna take something really strong
to ladder this bad boy I love this good
work cross here is absolutely gorgeous
with the leather toe and then the same
at the back how cool are they seriously
I'm totally obsessed with these I've not
had time to wear them yet I cannot
actually wait to wear these the gorgeous
I will leave links down below everything
in this video by the way of where I
bought these from you know it's been so
long since I showed you guys some
jewelry on this channel because I don't
wear that much jewelry not a stay and if
I do it's all very simple
quite silver does very delicate kind of
style jewelry and I'm really trying to
get into it much more now so I have some
beautiful pieces to show you these two
rings these are actually separates but I
have them together here this long one
here I love it's very me very very
simple and this one is a gorgeous
diamond encrusted it's not a perfect
circle which is what I love about it and
this is diamonds are on the outside so I
today I have stacked them nothing look
so pretty and then for some bracelets
these are two separate bracelets again
this one has a stunning gray stone
inside it and this one is little plates
and they have the very famous Monaco
at the Fiji style bracelet like this and
it's so beautiful I love them so yeah I
got to go into the Monica VIN into store
and have a look at all of the latest
collections I just I mean I love the
packaging I love how gorgeous everything
is when you buy it how it comes in these
beautiful boxes and packages everything
is so luxurious beautiful for gifting
for Christmas and things like that and I
mean the store is just absolutely
stunning it's like plums and rugs goals
and glassware everywhere it's just very
very beautiful very that luxurious
experience when you go in so I went into
their brand new comic garden store and
picked out a few new pieces and I'm just
absolutely adoring wearing them and
getting back into very simple elegant
delicate jewelry so those are the new
pieces that I picked up from Monika
venator okay this is a new bag I haven't
even more this out yet still got labels
on it
I bought this through the day this is a
Chloe backpack how amazing is this I saw
it in Paris I really wanted to buy it
there because I have a few trips coming
up I thought it would be nice to buy a
new backpack because I love wearing
backpacks that are so easy especially
for trips and this one of the perfect
just carry my phone my camera my
passport and you're all the kind of
essentials and then I can have my little
carry-on as well I don't wear gold often
but gold with blue is one of my favorite
kind of color combinations and I adore
it so many people have the over style
Chloe bag that's kind of like cross over
body I have so many cross over body bags
and don't need anymore but I did need a
new backpack so I treated myself to this
because I haven't bought a Chloe in a
very very long time I'll give you a
little it's a little close-up I also
just think it's a cute sort backpack and
I love it and I think it's so kind of
autumnal vibes it'll go is so so much
and it would preface my trips let's go
back again to shoes I picked up a new
parachute Wiseman from Louisa via roma
these are in the black suede I have the
brown suede and the grey suede and I
have worn them to death and I do have
one pair of black over knee boots which
are by Jean Vito russy's which I love
but they're very high and they're very
pointy so they're not always completely
appropriate for everything although I do
like to wear them everything but because
I wear my suit Wiseman's all the time I
knew that if I got these I would wear
them so much they're so comfortable
because of the larger heel you can wear
them
constantly I mean I like to wear mine
throughout the day I go shopping in them
I do everything in them but as you guys
know I'm a bit of a veteran when it
comes to Hill wearing I adore heels so
I'm used to it
well I would say for anyone getting into
heels these are a really easy
recommended option I must admit they're
very very comfortable
the disa gorgeous fabric so I wanted to
get them in the black as well
and I'm so glad I did oh my goodness
guys this jacket I don't know who I was
before I had this jacket in my life
honestly I am so in love with this I
didn't even realize how big this teddy
bear can furry coat trend was until I
bought this and then after that I've
seen everybody wearing it and I'm like
oh this is actually quite a big trend
and I didn't even realize I just really
really liked the coat so this is if you
can see this fabric have like a fabric
it's not that really teddy bear coat
fabric it's in a full black I love how
you can pop the collar on this bad boy
let me quickly put this up I like to
wear this like popped collar really cozy
around me open you can wear it with roll
necks you can wear t-shirts me however
you want to but it just fits so nice and
snug and I love it I'll leave a link
again to where you can get this from
down below but I got this in a 34 just
to let you know I usually do go for like
a size 6 and I wanted this to kind of be
the perfect size for me so a 34 fits
perfectly for me and I honestly
recommend so much I love it another
clothing piece I could not wait to share
with you is this suit I mean I love
tailoring anyway huge fun of tailoring
and recently I've been like to know what
I need to get some more suits in my
wardrobe because I feel like there's a
kind of thing I can wear at any time and
just feel amazing in so this suit is
navy with red piping now this makes a
look as loads of red in it there
actually isn't that much red this is
also quite a roasted burgundy red by the
way although it looks a lot lot brighter
here on camera so the actual suit is
like this this goes down into a gorgeous
blazer and then the trousers are just
matching and they just have a red stripe
down each side and also comes with this
cute little pocket square already in it
so it's like this with the pocket square
and then the trousers just like this and
I honestly I cannot wait
for the first time I get to wear these I
tried them on the other day I put it on
my in sasori's loads of people messaged
me asking why they were from there are
lots of other different colours as well
as there's a green there's a beige I
think there's also full burgundy suit it
completely depends on what you're really
into but I just knew I'd wear this a lot
so am I gonna wear this for like a white
tee underneath it a camisole or even
just brass just that really cool like
amazing bra under a blazer can feel I
want to rock that with incredible
massive heels that's the kind of style
I'm thinking couple more things to show
you I feel like it's quite a lot here
but it's because I haven't done one of
these kind of videos in about three or
four months actually I've collected a
few things recently again you'll have
seen these in the vlog potentially these
are my Cassidy boots they're absolutely
insane in terms of the heel it's a 120
millimeter heel for 12 centimeter heel
these after four hours four or five
hours of wearing these on concrete
outside I was ready to take off my legs
and lie them down they fit super snug
around your legs and feet
they're extremely sexy you don't have to
make them look really sexy though you
can just wear them in the cutest way you
want little black dress you can wear is
a long dress even you could just style
these with knitted dress or the cute
skirt knit top and it would still look
cool the beautifully made super high
quality and I am so happy how these in
my collection now cuz I know I'm gonna
wear them so so much for different
events another clothing piece I treated
myself to the other day was this one
this is a seat by Chloe louse oh it's so
me it's Navy it's got this polka dots
it's got lace it's a very beautiful
fabric it has this ruffle neck and also
has a navy camisole just inside it which
is quite small and quite dainty but it
just works off to stack up everything up
if you wanted to you don't have to wear
that it's not attached on the inside so
you could just wear a bra if you wanted
to kind of go for that more under wears
out to wear kind of trend but it's
something that I know I'm gonna wear so
much over the next few months so I'm a
big big fan of this and the last thing
to show you is this absolutely beautiful
bag from Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana I got this
again from the weaves of the aroma it's
a new and stock on there
I completely fell over that as soon as I
saw the image come up on the screen this
is a beautifully made black leather and
textured leather box bag it's just it's
an adorable lock closure like this opens
up the very typical urban animal print
on the inside and it does also have a
strap which I've attached but just come
off quite easily so I've just been
wearing this crossbody it's like the
perfect cross body length so nice I
think it's just absolute durable it's a
gorgeous shape and really robust shape
it's not gonna lose its shape it's got
that how many times did I say shape I
don't fit quite a bit in here as well I
can fit my iPhone 7 plus my camera lots
of other bits and bobs I still got it
over me but also it's gorgeous just a
kind of carrier in this way as well for
events for nights out when else I think
this would make a really gorgeous work
bag just as like a crossbody bag
depending on how much you take to work
but I got it for my collection because I
didn't have anything like this in terms
of black bags with so much detail and
hardware on the front I thought it was
quite a nice change and I really really
love it I think it's beautiful so that's
a wrap on all the latest things in my
wardrobe that are more kind of luxury
based I hope you guys enjoyed this if
you did I would love it if you
subscribed it came back for more next
time I make three videos a week just
