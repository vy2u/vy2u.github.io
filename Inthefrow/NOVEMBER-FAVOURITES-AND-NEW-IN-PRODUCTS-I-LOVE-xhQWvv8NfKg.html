favorites video I do really want to miss
this cuz I've been really really
enjoying doing this kind of monthly
favorites and new and products are
really really loving so I thought I'd
make sure I did one of them but although
it's a little bit late but make sure you
stick around until the end of the video
to see what is it still for the fourth
giveaway in my seven days for Christmas
giveaways so this is gonna be everything
I've been loving since my last favorites
so for like six weeks with Ashley and
I've got quite a bit of clothing to show
you I'm quite excited about it's usually
very beautiful so let's just get right
into our start with clothing this time
okay first thing I had to mention was
this incredible new bag this is from
ammonia frezz and it's a gorgeous
Valentino rocks turd spike bag on the
website I wasn't sure what kind of color
of new this would be and I'm so glad
it's this more kind of very busy toned
rather than more yellow tone nude it's
so perfect
I absolutely adore it I saw this
everywhere I have so many kind of as a
really large fashion bloggers in the US
who I really love and really inspire me
and a lot of those guys have this nude
the nude or the black and I totally fell
in love with it anyone have a nude bag
like this so I figured this would be the
perfect piece to add to my collection
and I'm absolutely in love with it it
also comes with a gold strap so you can
wear it crossbody we can also hold it
with handle which is a large handle but
I often kind of hook this through and
just kind of carry it underneath my life
I absolutely love it it's so beautiful
and it fits in so much as well it's got
quite a lot of space in here so I think
this is probably gonna be my most used
bag over the winter I've got a few
things I'm gonna be wearing this wear
that cap next up if you saw my a sauce
haul you'll have seen this shirt now
this has just been through the wash and
oh my goodness it needs the biggest ayah
ever but I just wanted to kind of
mention it and I'll insert some clips
hopefully here of me wearing this but
yeah Alex picked this out and it's a
beautiful blue very soft cotton shirt
it's from Jack Wills so it's got a
little Jack Wills label on it in fact
why do they have so much on it it's
a very very good eye Hey it feels
ridiculous my brother's looks anyway I
just want to mention how much I adore
this it also comes in a white if you saw
my a fuss hole
and it's just one of those really easy
pieces to wear with so many different
things like trousers wide leg trousers
jeans throughout with a skirt tucked in
so I just like to mention it I love it
so much I have not stopped wearing that
another piece I have not stopped wearing
art these Stuart Wiseman boots honestly
I didn't really get the hype when
everyone was buying suit wise and boots
I didn't really understand what the
height was all about and then I finally
found this color and thought actually
they're really nice and as soon as I put
them on my legs I realized why these are
so height and so many people love them I
can't tell you just how slim they make
my legs look I mean I know a lot of
people pull they say oh you've got very
slim legs anyway I don't like to have
the largest legs but honestly I've never
felt more confident as I do wearing me
because I really feel it so slimming on
the legs especially if you wear it the
way I do which is often with long
jumpers that just skim at the top of the
boot and it just makes your guys look
really lovely in slender so it's
extremely flattering and I think they're
absolutely beautiful a beautifully made
and I think therapy that if you invest
in these you're gonna have them for a
very very long time I know I will
another favorite which you've probably
already seen but it's this amazing
jumper dress from the Tommy Hilfiger
Gigi Hadid collection and I have the top
in it's a jumper and also comes in the
jumper dress and like I said because
I've been obsessed with of knee boots I
wanted more of a jumper dress style
I mean this is molting a bit it's one of
those kind of things where you find it
on your eyelashes it's on my nose it's
on my lips well I really loved it so
much I want this morning I have so many
compliments of everybody and it's just
extremely thick and wintery and
wonderful I'll insert another clip
actually of me already wearing this so
you can see it well it's just beautiful
and I managed to find this with about
40% off for some things so it's down
from 250 to 130 so I'll leave a link
down below if you're interested in
getting this
love it it's so thick and while it's
boiling I can't really wear it in the
house because when the radiators are
wrong I'm boiling hot in this also
actually a jewelry piece I barely ever
mentioned jewelry so I'm quite excited
this bracelet how pretty is this great
I'll take actually conceal a visa but
it's a gorgeous bangle
it's got hinge here so you can get into
it quite easily but it's in a thick gold
material and then they have three pearls
on the end it's very very cute you can
see that it's very cute this is from
Chloe and I got this for money a phrase
as well and I'll leave a link down below
but I just I barely ver wear bracelets
because I'm so lazy I can't even bother
to get them to fit on my wrist and get
them all what is the word fasten them
onto my wrist so this if I super easy in
the morning throat on the only issue is
I do often wear gold but I'm gonna be
wearing this alongside this bag Oh baby
Alex brought me coffee I love him my
Canada mobis I'm not to leave access say
oh yes I'm going to wear it alongside
this bag so it's bit of gold bit of gold
it'll be super nice with my very last
piece that when I mention in fashion and
it is this insanely gorgeous jumpsuit
from a qaq I mean the amount of people
that ask me going out on an evening do
or a big event where should I buy a
really amazing dress wrong and I need to
say self-portrait as you know or I say a
qaq because they often do the most
incredible jumpsuits I have a few little
sticks out and just absolutely adore
them I feel so confident in them so as
you're watching this I will be getting
ready for or I'll be just about ready
are but having drinks at the gleam
Christmas party so if you're not aware
anything that's going on then maybe go
to me Instagram for me so it's always
for my snapchat it'll all be on there
but we're at the gleam Christmas party
when you're watching this and they suits
what I'm going to be wearing so it's
going to perfect timing really I can
show you this I love it so much it has a
mesh top in nude white I cut out here
since a bit skin or show then the
trousers go down into a bit of a
wide-leg trouser with a stunning more
peach silk satin stripe down each leg so
it's just like neutrals
winter white I know a lot of people who
have been black
party and everyone was in white for
summer party now it's in black so maybe
I just like to do the contrasting colors
but I love this
so everybody wearing this with this gold
bracelet with this bag and probably some
chubby Taurasi shoes actually but just
so you know in case you're wondering
what is Victoria wearing tonight this is
what I'm wearing but a qaq is honestly
like one of my number ones when it comes
to event Italia okay so let's continue
and carry on with beauty I've got a few
things in beauty and actually have two
very random things to show you as well
but this is a beauty first up is the
Chanel so light and as Chanel I have
honestly heard about this so much over
YouTube past few years the amount of
people that use this and I was always
super intrigued but I was never really
sure about creme bronzers and how easy
they were to use but I think over the
years I started using them more and more
and I actually really almost prefer them
now because I find them less powdery a
little mildewy
I just like that kind of look anyway so
my gauge to try and it's actually
nowhere near as frightening as I thought
it would be so if you're a little bit
unsure about this anything cold cream
says I'm sure honestly it's just not
what you think it's so kind of hard and
compacted it's not like a mousse it's
not really liquidy
it's you've really got to kind of work
your brush over it to pick up the
product so when you apply it it does
apply right almost to the point if it
feels almost like a powder it's honestly
super easy to use and I've just been
using it very compacted brush or from
Make Up For Ever I'll try and leave the
brush down below because it's really
great with this and I just work it into
my cheek hollows so that's what I'm
wearing now as you'll see me applying it
cheek hollows don't find my temples
I'll be honest and my nose onto my chin
and I'm kind of good to go and I love
this effect it's so quick I can get my
bronzer done in like two minutes finish
off my whole face really with this it
really is so good I mean I the music for
so long he can barely see I mean it's
still got the ridges in it isn't gonna
last me for months and months
so yeah honestly must've hit honestly I
think this is something that a lot of
people should ask for for Christmas
because I really don't think you're
gonna be disappointed then moving into
highlight and there is some that I'm
absolutely blown away by I think I might
have missed the bandwagon with these but
it's the cover FX custom enhancer drops
I've got a feeling that these went out
of stock I'm sure that I had a chat with
Gazza cover effect is that they were
really are stock because they are that
insane
they are literally liquid drops of her
lessened
pigment they're so wonderful I mean you
could even mix these in with foundation
so I'd like you below as well but for
highlight they're just insane if you
like the more liquid highlight them you
I think you'll just like die for things
to be honest I've got the one now you'll
see me applying I just place them onto
the back of my hand I use a little brush
to kind of put it onto the areas that I
really want to understand is earth then
I use the back of my fingers to really
start dabbing it in and just a kind of
reducing intensity because it really is
like the alarm hickman this stuff and I
won't my fingers over it just kind of
use the heat on the fingers to blend it
into the cheeks and then I'll go over
with another brush I'll go over with a
sponge and it just kind of makes it a
little bit more realistic and you know
blend what I do with these is you don't
want it to look realistic you want it to
look like pow super bling I mean look at
my cheeks
they're just shiny then English thing
and I absolutely love them honestly
they're fantastic this one is so less
still for more of a champagne very light
pink pearlescent tone and this one is
moonlight a pit of something the week in
Sephora and this is much more of their
kind of rose gold II it's very kind of
Becca champagne pop that kind of style
rose gold champagne so they are amazing
but I also discovered iconic London
illuminator as well which is so similar
super similar concept almost in China
same product this one though is I think
this might just be one shade they do and
it's much more kind of golden still a
bit rose gold but a little bit more just
gold copper gold and I mean I've been
trying to show you now on the back of my
hand just how insane I mean can you see
that by catching a light oh my gosh look
at that in that she looks like I've
painted my hand with gold leaf it's
absolutely beautiful I can't recommend
these enough so perhaps if you can't
find these last few drops anywhere and
the iconic London honestly is a go to
Lhasa feeling in that toes
okay and I have two pallet favorites
this month you should always have a
pallet in here somewhere because they're
just pretty awesome these days first one
being the Tartus pro absolutely
beautiful I got my friend Rebecca he
lives in Chicago who I went to Chicago
with if you saw me in scope you'll have
seen high-hat the best time in Chicago
honestly this is the best holiday ever
it was just incredible and I asked her
to borrow this for me
obviously at Peter bag but Aspen to buy
it for me from America because it's not
as easy to get taught over here I'm
pretty sure it's pretty hard to get
Tartus Pro but I'll leave any links down
below if I can find it for anyone in the
UK but also some us links Oh Dan you
hear who the actual palette looks like
this it's so stunning so you've got 16
different matte shadows here and you've
also got four shimmers and there's such
beautiful colors you've got everything
to possibly need from neutrals to a more
kind of cranberries purple some
terracotta
deeper tones and then some nice bright
shimmery shades as well plus a humungous
mirror so it's a great travel companion
to have your mirror as well as all of
your shadows I love having this kind of
the kind of things so this to me is a
really really great palette it's
pigmented they're really easily
blendable shades I can't say much more
than that other than make some really
really great and I'm going to go in my
collection I love it break over here I
have my coffee and get rid of my pins
needle I mean Ansem only just as well
put the tree up we've got a cute little
tree would put all those decorations
everywhere I'm getting festive some
feeling really good and festive today
okay so and the last user product last
palette is this one from bareMinerals
this is the ready eyeshadows mineral
ready eyeshadows it's so stunning
they've landed into my p.o box the other
day and I always love it when their
minerals comes into my pure box I'll be
honest because they haven't yet failed
me with their recent collections and
pieces they're honestly so so good and
this is no difference actually this is
what you get inside
I mean to be like it looks somewhat
normal but it's actually full of shades
that I use so often and I feel I'm gonna
probably taking this home with me for
Christmas because I know I've got
in here never skip it you see a big
mirror again but you've got like a
lovely shimmering kind of inner corner
highlight you've got a slightly less
shimmery bit more creamy a little bit of
highlighter shade here which it goes
perfect for the brow bone you've got
lovely almost rose gold champagne
perfect on your eyelid you've got some
great cliched stuck help with these a
little bit more of a cranberry tone at
the end some more deeper shades gorgeous
gold gorgeous silver and again and more
kind of lighter toned cliche so for me
they show off everything that I reach
for when I want to do a full eye look
rather than home to go over here to get
an inner corner highlight and over here
to get brow bone highlight I've kind of
got everything just hit honestly I
actually find it really hard I think my
nose is like yeah honestly since its
came and else I love it so this is kind
of my one and only right now I
absolutely love it well apart from this
one these two I'm going between but
generally it's quite often this one I'll
be honest the joys of living on a main
road that you hear every single siren
yes so honestly highly highly
recommended I think this is beautiful
and I also think it'd make a really
gorgeous Christmas present for anyone up
see anyone at any age actually I think
my mom would love this palette I might
actually think about getting me one and
finally for things I'm loving really
really random but I really want to
mention this this pair of scissors okay
this is random for favourites video but
aren't they just the most beautiful pair
of scissors you ever seen look at this
little handle in gold but anyone who
loves their interiors and lots of
stationery
that's fun I mention it because I saw
these on the website and they're just
soldiery mean they're from a brand
called hey Italian brand they're just so
pretty in lessons it's nice that noise
is just it just reminds me of like being
a child and cutting paper in class and
you know really nice love them I know
it's really random but I'm excited to
cut all of my Christmas paper with these
because it's gonna be a joy so I wanted
to mention them because every time I
look at them I'm like I really love
these scissors okay I'm a bit weird but
never mind I love but not least my
newbie I never thought I'd be someone
that weirdo in a pair of beads but I do
because I'm really trying to get back
into the gym and I really needed some
wireless if
these what I got and they're a pair of
powerbeats I don't think drayton own
beats anymore to see I think it's a
couple isn't it anyway tell you love
them and I got them in the white cuz I'm
secure with my hair how sad is that
I want to forgot my hair and I never
thought these would fit in my ears but
they actually do they come in a few
different sizes I'm gonna try them on to
see can actually see you just gonna like
wiggle them around a little bit I'm
gonna fit in your ears oh that's it
you see they're not really big and
boisterous I'm just thinking about now
I thought that really stick out my head
and make me look really strange but they
actually fit me the nests in so
obviously when I've got your hair up
they're just not too much and I mean I
don't look like I've got crazy things
that amaze I'm so good also they should
be in the back I go to the back oh yeah
great isn't it Seamus use this little
thing on the side to skip three tracks
to open down your volume it's super easy
so yeah it should have been that way by
the way just so you know well yeah total
of them to come in a little k to speak
and carry them around it just did eat it
and I was looking around for a while a
good pair of like wireless earphones
I mean I realize he's a kind of upper
scale wireless but actually really
really good and I'm really really
pleased to them actually Sam happy happy
and just to finish off with some things
that I have in new and haven't quite
tried yet but I'm pretty excited about
as always with these new in bits I don't
show you a few things actually that are
absolutely beautiful that would make
really lovely Christmas presents to you
actually the Christmas do your
collection the Confessor to your
collection has some absolutely stunning
pieces first
I mean how gorgeous is that packaging of
that nail polish this is d rific in
Venise 0:01 Nova and it's almost like a
glitter top coat I mean it is a glitter
top coat you could wear this on your own
if you want and you could build up the
color so it's just very good to eat but
over the top of color as well it's so
pretty and it leaves these gorgeous
luminescent almost like well it's very
pearlescent sort of finish of glitter
like some large a bit some smaller bits
some sort of strands of glitter and it's
so gorgeous I tried this over a recent
shellac and it this looks so glitz seen
and really beautiful I think honestly if
you're looking to buy someone a nail
varnish you know that you can go around
with a gorgeous glittery top coat
they've also come out with this terrific
matte fluid which I think is almost a
bit of
they Velvet Matte lip and this color is
stunning what is a zero zero three yeah
it's got more of a velvety texture as
well with this more so than any of the
other Dior lipsticks I've dried but I
mean that color is so pretty and it's
almost a bit like a more raspberry toned
a little bit ly lucky pink you know
purpley fuchsia yes I'm so excited
wearing this look this is so beautiful I
mean the packaging is to die for and
also finally it did your eyeshadow
palette in precious embroidery this is
just so exquisite the colors are perfect
they're very very me there's a rose gold
there's a sparkling Karambit purple is
white there's a deep brown and more of a
perfectly brown as well and I'll try and
do a cutaway for this because the colors
are so beautiful and the intricacy of
the powder and the way the doulas it
looks like sequins it's all cut into the
powder it's just amazing honestly it's
incredible so yeah I think this is a
massive hit and it's stunning for
Christmas also new in is this gorgeous
nail polish primitive on shoot it looks
a bit black here on camera but actually
this is purple ink number 31 and it
really is a stunning violet purple super
bright almost looks almost a little bit
neon it's so bright you can see that
it's stunning so I'm really excited
about trying that it's as hard to have
Sherlock so much but when I do have like
a little moment in between let's try out
the ones that I love the most and
finally I couldn't not mention the
gorgeous go arm Christmas festive
packaging this is a meteorite face
powder and look at the Christmas
packaging on this it's so intricate and
delicate and beautiful and just inside
