makeup makeup morning routine tutorial I
put a picture up on Instagram with the
other day of a very minimal make of what
I was wearing and a lot of you come in
to advise me to do a tutorial so thought
that I would film this for you it's a
lot kind of really really loving wearing
moment have been wearing it a lot since
I saw put it together it only uses eight
products and I timed myself filming this
so it only took me eight minutes to put
it together so if you're ever in a rush
in the morning before you get to work
and you've only got ten minutes but your
makeup you only use eight minutes to put
this one together so super simple super
quick it's just really very Jewish skin
like pink cheeks are highlighted lots of
bronze that open eyes and a nice nude
lip so it's a very no makeup lock very
minimalistic and neutral very natural so
if you'd like to know how to get this
look then please keep watching okay so
I'll just tie it back I'm gonna see how
long it takes mix and I think this is
gonna be quite fast so I've got
everything in this cute little cap kits
in I travel makeup case let's go from
there to split it super easy for me to
kind of get them all out and I've
already applied the regen serum and skin
rages aren't you a clip on to sort of my
face really nice of cream gel hybrid
it's really hydrates and moisturizes
skin so let's get started I'm going to
start off with the Maybelline eraser I
good to these ions this is really nice
because it's got a little brush in it it
almost does what your maker brush would
do anyway so it's almost like you don't
even need to go in this later half a
little bit around the edges of
evaluation so it's really quite nice
then I'm going to apply my favorite
still but in moments especially this
kind of makeup look
it's the BB cream shade makes you super
cute see you at just well blur out those
edges for the concealer
I always like to the few dialects as
well
don't particular call up my lips nude
lips just allows you to create any pull
out let me create the great break thanks
I'm kind of trying to do this imagining
myself really crushed and morning
desperate to get myself ready to see how
long I actually need for the most
minimal type of makeup that's done then
I'm just gonna quickly he's the same
brush my hourglass ambient lighting
powder in cereal quickly set to zone
gonna take the one and only now like
runs that this is just gonna out ultra
all head down the same brush to skip out
the contouring phase your routine
Joline I'm Dominic
brats then I'm going to take on my
favorite estee lauder plushies NASA's
limited edition I have sold out now but
you've got anything similar
it's a beautiful light pink shimmery
blush that almost works as a highlighter
as well it's got such shimmery particles
so for a quick makeup routine this again
or add highlight and bush
so cuts out the time a little bit and
again if they're completely enhances
that globe should we blow then I'm going
to add the benefit gimme brow this will
cut out the time you need to do your
soft powder in your eyebrows and
everything else just do everything for
you know just make it look so much fun
natural
okay two things left got SCARA got
lipstick so gonna quickly kill my how is
Jesus the Shu Uemura eyelash curlers
right the mace good good we found a nun
be dexterous with this as well I use
left hand left eye
I have right eye does anyone else do
that is it just me think about this
before whatever as I know your justice
bit strange but I think I've just taught
myself to do left left right to riot
nice it's a nice camera then I'm gonna
lose this amazing Clarins waterproof
mascara
where has waterproof mascara beating all
my life I have the worst eyelashes ever
they don't curl ridiculous is straight
and this is the first time I've used
waterproof mascara how ridiculous is
that and I've just realized how amazing
yeah
except I applying this mascara my ashes
do not move
all day I don't you to curl them a
second time to do anything to them
already done that stir
just look how open look laughing at
least the way I sell new page number one
lipstick it's like a bomb Master
Canada's so eight minute 20 look that
start to finish makeup so that isn't too
bad
one second let me just clean up what
prove mascara I love it but it's hard to
get off and they have it now what I've
also been liking to do recently is add a
bit of a side ponytail
good twist up
a little bit every left back in push it
all back in and then if you pull from
the top of your Pony Oh
it adds a little bit left that's a
little bit of kind of backcombing into
it you gotta kind of keep saying going
out a little bit left leg so thank you
