new get ready with me this time for a
much more natural light weight everyday
wearable makeup lock using a big mixture
of different Browns I absolutely adore
and just kind of pull them together and
forming something just very very
wearable recently I've been really
enjoying doing much more sort of heavier
makeup more full of finishes and is
feeling really flawless but I feel like
getting into spring we need to kind of
tone it down just a tad so I've gone for
something much more lightweight this
time so I really hope that you like it
it's using a lot of product so I'm
totally loving right now so hopefully
you'll find some new products in this
video that you love just as much yeah so
I guess if you'd like to see how I got
this very natural very lightweight
makeup look then just keep watching okay
so with this only go something that's
quite minimal still doing glowy but also
so it's quite quick kind of
low-maintenance but somewhat natural so
that's the kind of thing we're going to
go for I'm going to start off with the
girl and meteorites my striving radiant
booster and moisturizer and an
illuminator and one pretty much my new
favorite foundation
it's the Armani
maestro glow I have shade for the head
makeup artist for Armani Linda can tell
oh she says you use this with your
fingertips she's absolutely fine you can
do that I'm just not really one for
doing that so I'm going to put this onto
the back of my hand now this is probably
a little bit too dark for me right now
but I'm usually a lot more tanned but
I'm just gonna have to work it down the
neck I'm gonna use the Armani brush I'll
use my link download not sure what
number is I'm just going to wear this in
I don't want the coverage to really
really heavy so I'm just kind of using
whatever's left on this brush now to
work that in my favorite concealer right
now is the bare minerals bearskin this
stuff is so good a little bit places
that need a little extra I'm just going
to use the do your Doris's wash it
sustained do your Beautyblender just to
cleansing got a really bad patch and dry
skin on my eyelid right now really
annoying me next up I'm going to use the
Armani CC Armani micro felt like powder
you tap a little bit off into the lid
I'm just going to use a eyeliner brush
just a brush into that set those and
arrive oh my god I can't even tell you
how soft this brush is that is actually
ridiculous so I'm going to go quite
minimal the cheeks I'm not gonna do the
whole contouring thing I'm just going to
use the galan terracotta Four Seasons
bronzer in natural blondes only use the
armani bronzer brush just all over this
bad boy and then I'm gonna give it runs
of those cheeks nothing too precise
okay I think these are manly brushes are
officially the most incredible brushes I
have ever used ever next up this is so
beautiful this is a Burberry
spring/summer runway palette in white
number one look at this seriously oh my
gosh it is so gorgeous I'm going to use
the same I'm on a brush from before
some cheekbones it's nothing too over
the top with so absolutely gleam then
I'm going to go in with the Gwen Stefani
blush palette which just looks insane Oh
see here it's more kind of orangey Coral
easy blush don't listen to over the top
isn't it quite easy more bronzy neutral
tone really what one thing I am going to
add though my favorite things ever since
the deal lip glow looks like this nod no
bomb put on the lips it seriously
brightens and it's so hydrating middle
it sure looks like I've applied a light
pink and next up just going to go for
the eyes and the thing that I'm loving
right now for the eyes is this from
Chanel this is the new moon light pink
the illusions ombre
it says when that ombre eye shadows all
know do you want to use this Armani I
think this is like the large contour and
it's just going to wing it through my
crease it's so gorgeous
is there something really natural about
it but the ways captchas a lie is so
pretty I'm going to start applying it
all over the lid
and then also mainly the heavier
coverage into the crease let's go back
the bigger brush just to make sure it's
all blended but pretty sure it is just
going to use more of a precision brush
very in a corner wake up the eyes the
only other thing when I add to my lips
really is the Burberry pencil in
Rosewood now I can't seem to find this
online anywhere to link it but I'm
pretty sure if you go into a Burberry
boutique store you'll be able to find
this it's gonna add a bit of a line you
could make it easy on yourself and fly
this before the lip balm but do any
think about just want to apply a little
bit of brows and there's no point in
maybe like oh try something new because
it's not going to be as good as the I'm
Brad maestro from Giorgio Armani
they use the speed brow from benefit
suppose it's quite good for this help
set them in and give us a little bit
more shape and definition going to give
Massa the curl I'm going to go in or I'm
going to go in with the Dior show
waterproof mascara button washes because
you know me I'm just going to add in
some of the Rimmel scandaleyes this
isn't a shade 0-5 nude I'm just going to
add it in to the waterline this is such
a brilliant pencil it's really quite
pigmented so it actually shows up where
some news I tried up is so rubbish
and that is the finished look just very
natural like my skin literally feels
like it's been anything on I mean
usually when I put my makeup I can never
feel too heavy but literally the way it
feels it's just extremely light at the
same time I look quite glowy and
somewhat jewy and luminous and I'm quite
a fan of this blush I think it actually
looks really pretty
this almost orangey tone I think it's
something really quite warming yes
that's it what do you think guys let me
know down below if you didn't liked this
I thought it's about time I did a more
natural makeup look after doing a few
heavier but luxury styles so let me know
what you thought please do give the
video a like now if you liked it

next time and I guess I'll see you then
