really really well today's video is
going to be a new in beauty video so
it's about all the different products
that are launching soon new collections
that are coming into store soon as well
as some new products to my collection as
well so there might be a few products
mingled in here that have been
outstanding for quite a while you can
already get quite a while but I have
never had them before I'm going to go
through those as well because maybe you
haven't seen them either so yeah let's
just get straight into it ok so first up
as you will probably know there have
been a lot of new launches in the
YouTube community first stop Fleur has
collaborated with eyelashes and I think
there might be four different ones in
the collection it might be wrong here
really sorry for him anyway this is just
one of those these are the flirt loves
lashes which are more of a three-quarter
length / so much more petite a lot more
sort of natural Alice add that flutter
to the eyelashes this is exciting then
we have the launch of Zoe's new beauty
and body range even more cute packaging
in the last range that she launched some
really beautiful colors here lemon
yellows and mints and pinks and futures
really beautiful they all smell
absolutely gorgeous as well I mean like
this scrubbing me softly smoothing body
scrub it smells so lovely so the lovely
white scrub with little red beads really
great for exfoliating great for a few
self tan like idea it's great to rub all
over your body and exfoliate before you
tan and then they say lovely softening
body lotion
kandi kream Jen smells beautiful and
then the bath fitter I love the last one
and these are absolutely great these are
fragrance bath visitors fresh fish so
you just break off a block of these put
them in your bath unfortunately I don't
have a bath so these might go slightly
to waste on me so I'm gonna have to give
them to a friend and then there's also
the launch of tally birds new collection
as well I could show you a few tips and
pieces from that such as the lovely I
pallets that she's brought out a few
different colorways this is a Hollywood
I palate with some gold shimmer grounds
in there and she is also redefined the
nail polish bottles as well these are
really kind of looks and more luxurious
lots of beautiful lashes as well and the
packaging is really gorgeous okay next
up is Clarence Clarence will come out
with four new lip liner shade all about
the new gotten one two three and four
all in nude shades nude bear got new
rose deeper more brown beige shade and
then new beige we go right in the middle
nude fair on a very very bottom is just
a much more probably wear that with most
of your nude lipsticks moving up through
much more kind of brown tones so they
aren't really really look like great for
the girl who's also noodle it then
Clarence is also just relaunched those
surely surely Rouge lipsett questions so
many shades in this collection and
they've just revamped them with
apparently more moisturizing formula in
moisture enriched formula they call it
so anyway so I've been having luck
through the collection so sent me quite
a few of the lipsticks this wasn't in
this really gorgeous tin actually
Johnny whoosh anyway I thought she gets
my favorite shades from this collection
that would definitely be lilac pink 750
I'm obsessed with sharing a moment this
is petal pink 707 more pinky toned
aniline lick but again such a wearable
shade and then if you want to go for
your red then you've got 74 to Jolie
Rouge jellyfish this is pull out the
signature red which beautiful cherry red
in the collection so those would be my
face but I mean the actual lipsticks are
so gorgeous really lovely minimalistic
packaging's that yeah this looks really
kind of classic now this is the most
beautifully packaged collection I've
seen it's so pretty it's the oliver
bonas I mean I have no idea all of a
bonus did anything other than furniture
until like two months ago and I realize
it a clothing and now I'm just found out
that they do beauty so these are the
elderflower fears like these must be
that bath crystals this smell absolutely
divine that is so nice and it's a
sapristi of packaging yo gorgeous this
is the pomegranate bat marbles like a
little cracker this is the praline and
cream lip balm so cream it's like
vanilla cream that's so pretty this lip
balm we've got the peony rose fragrance
rollerball again gorgeous packaging
these were so nice like gifts 50 people
really push little rollable
well not had a rollerball is so long
like this is so lovely that smells
gorgeous is so nice so floral a peony
florally okay next up jo malone again
someone that does very beautiful
packaging this is the mimosa and
cardamon cologne there's a smile at
cardamon sort of spicy but quite still
quite subtle and between floral and kind
of spicy but again it's like a subtle
space is that cardamom spice be the
gorgeous yeah they have such a variety
of different smells Joe Malone like the
blue and I on each times are also
different but it just means it caters
for everybody I mean the packaging and
the bottles are always so sophisticated
and beautiful this is exciting Melissa's
burberry's new collection they are going
very much result of trend LED car fuses
season this is the autumn/winter 2015
runway palette
and inside it says camouflage pattern a
shadow palette really actually quite
pigmented as well so they are beautiful
and a little big mirror so when you need
it and it also comes with a couple of
brushes in the pouch to ensure this it
like a collection launch press and this
is the face contour in median one when
you open up its ass like a little ball
applicator and when you run it on to the
face off so you can create contour lines
on the face anyway once is perfect if
you really like to contour your nose as
well so you can draw it everywhere and
it blends beautifully into the skin and
just provides us with a gorgeous contour
and they also have the fresh glow
highlighting luminous pen that's coming
out I imagine it's a bit oh oh amazing
it's like the contour um pen with the a
blip on top but that's really pretty see
that all glistening which again with
perfect for using with the contour stick
down the nose keep his beau beautiful i
really like that i'm not seeing
highlighting kind of stick like that in
a while then we have why sell they just
brought out black opium o de toilette
they already had the Eau de Parfum out
already but this is a much more soft
sweeter potentially more day wear but
still got a very sexy seductive grungy
feel to it is
the gorgeous perfume it's so sexy when
the newest releases is this gorgeous
eyeshadow palette with 10 different
shades in there are very sort of neutral
tone shades and they are lovely and
pigmented as well and also get a little
brush in there too this is a less sahari
ends and it's a sun-kissed fuller
Perfector and the idea with these is a
few different shades frictional fat six
to eight different shades and that all
almost like bronzers but the very first
one in the set is more of a highlight
shade or a lighter shade and it goes
into deep deeper colors they're almost
like cream that to powder sort of
formulation kind of thing you could use
for contour and you could use it for
bronzing all over if you get a few
different shades in there and it also
comes with this cute little brush it's
got a sponge on one end and a brush on
the other second ease in a few different
ways this is in shade number two but i
will leave it down below if you can find
out shapes next up we have some pieces
from freedom makeup think it might be
the sister brand of makeup revolution or
very similar and the idea being that the
products are a more professional makeup
artists kind of kit rather makeup
revolution is a little bit more
affordable these are still affordable
but higher quality that's kind of idea
with them here are three different
palettes I thought I would show you
these are six pound each by the way so
extremely affordable so they have 12
different shades inside each one all
with very berry color variations and
this is much more of a kind of pinky
nude neutrals palette that's the pro12
audacious 3 and this one's a bit more of
a thorn very bright colorful
that's the pro12 dreamcatcher and this
one is pro12 romance and jewels so the
kind of really going for this whole
professional feel really highly
pigmented actually seems really really
lovely so they are great if you control
more affordable palettes and you want a
big variety of shades and these are
pretty great 6-pound you can't really
beat it then I have some new bits from
collection which are launching extremely
soon these are getting our kind of more
professional pallets that they are
bringing out so this is the bush and go
palette with a bronzer highlighter and
two different blush shade beside it and
again I think these are like five pounds
so affordable this one's your style your
mood boom lotsa brush two different
looks in here they're more purples and
then more neutral greens again perfect
for the car key trend this winter autumn
winter this is the face add a palette
again it's got so different types of
things signior here such as highlight
bronzer woman aironet of course two
different I'm shadows or blush so they
are great and these are all coming out
and really really soon I'm also pretty
excited to try this palette from becca I
don't think this is brand new but I
definitely be reviewing it soon and it's
the ombre nude eye palette of five
different shades inside very much the
nude neutral brown eye the lady who
loves his kind of shade these are really
really pretty and lovely in Mac forms
but aren't many places but just do matte
eyeshadow palettes the pigmentation is
great that you've got to build up some
really pretty eye looks with this
especially if you go for this most days
then it's kind of a great one to have
about your everyday statement palette
that you do for every single I look
that's gorgeous can't wait to try that
out last thing I want to mention is the
brand-new radiance fail from Illamasqua
it's not out yet it'll be out really
really soon I love their hand reveal
it's almost like a crime ER and it
got the most incredible consistency so
I'm off like a gel and when you sort of
move it around after a few moments we'll
start to kind of form back again and if
you can imagine that on your skin it's
just forming into all your pores and
Karina's perfected base and this is now
the radiance fail and it just looks
amazing I mean if you love jewelry skin
and you're looking at Ultra highlighted
skin right now you will love this it is
so amazing open it up I'm looks like
it's pink tone shimmery incredible nurse
inside and the idea with this is that
obviously you put this on know where to
put it you put this on underneath your
base and it's just incredible it's
almost like rose gold peachy shimmery
tones and if you can imagine putting
honest your primer underneath your base
and then put your foundation at the top
your skin or just radiates light so
incredibly these guys just come up with
the coolest concepts or products
absolutely love that so that's not
really soon I'm going to be doing a full
blog post on this release soon which I'm
really excited about so keep an eye out
for that I think it's definitely all
I've got time for these are all of the
new releases that I've been collecting
together they're going to be reviewing
soon on in the fro calm so have a look
they're really really soon like I said
one or two will be products that you'll
already have seen in stores perhaps or
before even out for a while but I want
you to mention them just because you
were new to me they might be new to you
really hope he finds interesting and you
might be excited for some of the new
releases are coming out I know that I am
