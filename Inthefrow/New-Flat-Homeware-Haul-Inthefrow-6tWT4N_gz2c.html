apartment and a brand new video I
thought I'd film a home haul because
I've actually never done a home home
before and so many of you been asking me
what I've been filling my brand-new flat
with as so many of you may know now I
now live in London which is so exciting
so I have been accumulating quite a lot
of new things to show you so let's get
right into it this little guy you might
have seen in might ask Victoria video I
got this for Christmas actually it's
actually a little doorstop to hold all
your doors back can just look really
really cute little Douglas a sausage dog
because I really really really want a
sausage dog but I don't think I'm gonna
be able to manage to get one in this
flat but still this is a nice little
close second how many of you asked me
where I got this from and it's just from
next in fact I didn't get it I got it as
a present for Christmas so I don't know
how much it was but I think it's pulling
around 20 to 25 pounds
another Christmas present and this time
this is from my lovely boyfriend who is
getting it food milk who's fat just over
there working got this beautiful
beautiful bars from Rob Ryan you can get
these in quite a few different stores
that I've seen see so he got me this for
Christmas and it's so so pretty and he
also got me some plates to match it as
well a lot of amazing some Instagram
pictures and in the background of videos
and things like that look beautiful with
loads of big flowers coming out of it so
I love this and it's just so cute and
unusual it says please smell us next
thing I got was from M&amp;amp;S I got leave
myself I saw them before Christmas and I
was going to get the men and then I went
back after Christmas just to see if I
was still there and they're in sales so
they were half-price she might be able
to get these and they're like little
glass tumblers they came in a set for
and I also got the city exact same ones
but double the size and they were like
pint glasses and they're each around 20
pound a pack I think they might get
about 10 pound a pack actually for four
and they're so pretty there almost like
whiskey tumblers in this kind of crystal
effected glass I don't know if it's
crystal or not but if they're really
really really nice so I love those
another thing that I got for Christmas
off my mum because she just seemed to
want to buy me everything for my home
this Christmas which I'm not complaining
about because I love home where and she
got me this little egg cup holder thing
egg holder from next and it's really
strange if I seen this myself and next
and like lost it over it I was like oh
my god it's so cute and she just
happened to get for Christmas and
shouldn't even know that liked it so
great minds obviously but it's so sweet
it's got six little holders to put your
eggs in and it's like a little hen house
heart next present the keeps us all full
of presents it might as well be called
my what I got for Christmas video but
still Alex got me this it's a little
science that's delicious
that I just it's just so unique it's so
different I've never had anything like
this before it got two little hooks on
the back so you can hang it up and we've
been having this over top of that rocker
so it's just really really sweet and
nice little piece for the kitchen index
think candles I love candles and I have
been stocking up recently from these
from melon and goats and these came well
first of all these paid the set of three
coming up step three and they're all
really sort of unusual different
smelling candles I think this one is
tobacco you'd think would smell or for
bit smells really cool I really soft
musty woody and I smell this one is
wrong it smells great it's so nice it's
so unusual and then this one is vetiver
good knows what vetiver is but it smells
good then I'm also working my way
through a larger one again from melon
and goetta this is in neroli just a
really fresh vibrant almost quite
citrusy scent really pretty and it just
it's burning really really nicely and
makes the room smell really beautiful so
a big fan of candles and I'm currently
on this melon and go ex candle trade so
we'll see how that goes but I'm really
really liking those and then when I
moved in jo Malone were lovely enough to
send me a little new vegan gift and they
sent me a reed diffuser in fact I could
do is turning these around
yes so the game in this reader fuser and
it's so lovely it's in the scent what
Santa says it's in the scent lime basil
and Mandarin its a bright stress a smell
of a kind of home smell really lovely
thank you Joe alone next up is something
that I have wanted for years and years
and years and I've never got around to
getting and finally I got my hands on
one from Urban Outfitters
this may seem totally dull to you but
I'm vision for this from Joseph and
Joseph and it's a chopping board set to
get 40 with chopping boards and it's
really cute because it has little
symbols on it to say what to use before
I just it just make sure that you're not
going chopping your vegetables on your
meat board and kind of transferrin germs
or anything that things it just keeps
everything nice and clean
so you've also got vegetables actually
don't know what this symbol stands for
that symbol stands for soup why would it
be soup on the chopping block
it looks like a ball would heat come off
a business I don't know I don't know I
just use that for anything that's that's
my anything bought apart from me it's
apart from meat babe
then this one obviously fish it's got a
little little fish on it and this one
for meat so like if they're just keeps
everything nice and fresh and clean
that's from Urban Outfitters Joseph and
Joseph also from Joe's from Joe's if I
haven't use these yet but it's a really
cute little utensil set and they are put
together little magnets and so you get a
large ladle you get a nice big spoon you
get a another large spoon with a foot
down the center that's more of a caster
spoon and I would imagine
I mean you've all just got like a
spaghetti spoon politics I'm not going
to be perfect and then this one it's the
kind of I don't know you know for frying
pan and I'm gonna use it's probably
quite sweet honey I'll clip together and
they stand up on a label like that and
again they're just from Joseph from
Urban Outfitters
nice and colorful also from the Urban
Outfitters and absolutely in love with
this throw I put a picture on Instagram
and everyone's like where's that throw
from
it's from Urban Outfitters again and I
think it's from a brand called tweed
male it's a beautiful tweed fabric
really thick and you can tell the
quality of it I think is around 75
pounds so it's obviously a little bit
more money but you will pay more money
for really good throws I've always found
that so yeah it's so pretty a loose on
the end of my bed and if me I let's get
cold we can wrap ourselves in it I just
really really like that so that's from
Urban Outfitters the next thing that's
really want to mention because I really
love being if these are called in
fruition through through chin diffusion
and fruition I think I'm right intuition
and the idea behind these is that you
can leave the mini-fridge filled with
water and then inside these Oh inside
the ease you put fruit you can put
strawberries you can put cucumbers you
can put lime and lemons and then you put
them inside your water and you can leave
them like that so we're nights are going
to fill out your fruit and water and
leave it in the fridge and then whenever
you want we can pour out beautiful fruit
tasting water which is really really
nice we've got two of those to keep in
fridge next things I'm absolutely loving
as everything else in this hellhole I'm
living but a lot of you loving this as
well when I showed you this on my
Twitter and it's my new unicorn Wannsee
this is from a brand called oh dear and
I think these are sold a few four places
and I saw one recently and I put it on
my Pinterest board so it's like I need
it I need it it's absolutely amazing and
I saw the oh dear Souls one and I
managed to get my hands on one so it's a
big fluffy soft unicorn one see it's got
a big pink tail it's almost like Kareem
drop crotch licks it comes in one size
so it's super large it's so cozy and
it's been so many days where I mean I've
been working from home look at that
little been working from home and I've
just been spending the entire day in
these ones be walking around and just
like cuddly not and it's so soft and
love it so that's from oh dear
also from oh dear is this jug I've been
after a jug that you
for ice and water and lemon from the
table know when you have an uh Camille
and you for like a little bit more water
instead of having to get up and down and
go to the kitchen to fill up your water
I wanted something I could just leave on
the table who especially like dinner
parties and things so they saw this oh
dear
and I actually adored it so how to get
it for the flat it's in one of my
favorite colors one of my favorite
course is aqua blue turquoise this
lovely floral prints have got quite a
kind of country-style look to it but
it's so lovely so that'd be so lovely
for on the dinner table
and the final thing you from oh dear is
this cushion which just says I like you
and it's a cat a dog sniffing a cat's
thumb hmm what a super cute and and it's
got a lovely almost like suede off its
way it could be suede but swayed back
and this is also suede and again it's
from oh dear a lot of you may have seen
my pillow that I've used in my bed for
most of my videos and it's got a polar
bear on it and it's called the Bob
cushion and again Oh DSL back as well so
this is kind of similar style it's
really thick and lovely so I've got the
only chair okay I'm almost done I
promise last few things
it's best I'm going to show you these
I'm not going take you Lisa wrap the X I
want to keep them really really nice me
and Alex got ourselves some initial
towels so these are for a brand called
soak and sleep and I've got mine in the
lavender gray it's quite a few different
colors is about eight different colors
but I want to lavender gray because I
thought it was quite a nice neutral
color for the bathroom and I got our
initials put into them so for Alex you
got a H and then for me I've got the M I
hope you can see that if you actually
sleep embroidered you're on them by how
sweet so we have a way of folding our
towels now so when they're hung up over
our little
radiator wall rack thing you can see the
M and a hate the third Pridgen is so
soft these are from soaked and sleet and
I'm pretty sure these are Egyptian
cotton a really lovely quality Japan
cotton and they're huge they're a big
bath towels so
these are amazing and that is everything
I really really hope you like what I
picked up it has anything that you think
I might particularly like for the new
flat then you let me know over there
when I still have a little Google and
have a look at what you might be
recommending so if any of you are
