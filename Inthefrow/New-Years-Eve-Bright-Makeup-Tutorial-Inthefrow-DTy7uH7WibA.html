all really really excited about New
Year's Eve I know I am and that's why I
have put together this makeup look just
as an idea for your new year I wanted to
go for some clothes that were a little
bit more experimental than I would
usually go for as you know I like my fur
balls
I like my goals and browns and neutrals
I wanted to go for something really with
a different for me
so it's blue it's gold it's orange and
I've got big fluttery lashes a overdrawn
like large noodle it because I wanted
the lips to be still quite statement
without being bold so this is the
overall look I really really hope you
like it if you'd like to know how to get
it then just keep on watching as always
I'm using the lush million dollar
moisturizer so many of you have bought
this now on my recommendation and so
please because I don't think I've heard
one negative comment you've all been
like it's amazing it's worked for me as
well alright well people in my family
bought it and my best mates are bought
it right so it's New Years Eve and also
you want to be pretty down flawless and
when I go for flawless skin usually
anyway I'm gonna go for the magic
foundation by Charlotte Tilbury and I've
got two shades here one is three and one
is two this is fair pale this is fair
pale but which is obviously much much
paler but I'm gonna mix the two and just
get my main shade I'm gonna mix the two
together on the back of my I'm just
gonna work that in this is the zoeva
divine buffer which you'll know that I
use most times but I find it distributes
the product really really well okay so
well pretty much looks okay I'm just
gonna conceal and then I'm gonna go over
the whole thing with a sponge I'm gonna
use today the fixative ideal like prime
and conceal it's quite cool it's like a
primer inside of them to consume the
outside
just some mac prep and prime just helps
to lighten up all the areas a bit more
yeah I mean you can add as much
concealer as you like to some people
prefer not as much concealer a lot of
people prefer more concealer I guess
there are those people
so as I'm blending this in I'm also just
gonna go around my whole face and just
pass in all of that foundation to just
make it really worked into the skin it's
just a real techniques sponge I thought
I would do my eyeshadow first want to do
something a little bit different because
I've been having a lot of you feel like
you always do the same thing and it's
just because I'm not a makeup artist and
I'm not a beauty guru I'm just someone
who really likes makeup and therefore I
don't really experiment that much with
colors and techniques and looks
I wouldn't necessarily ever do I prefer
makeup looks are natural or are easy to
accomplish or just much more wearable
I've chosen a few different colors and
it's something that I would wear but
it's just a little bit more experimental
and usual so hopefully you like it we're
gonna go so lorac mega palette again
because I've seen if you sort of said
please use different colors out of it
show us more look so I thought I would
and this palette is just amazing it's so
beautiful so I'm gonna go for blue gold
and orange yeah that's what we're going
for today I'm just gonna lay down a base
first of all so I'm just gonna go for
sorbet here and bisque I did this last
time this tutorial and it just works
really well as a nice crease shade into
the crease starting off with my Mac 2 on
7 which is probably my favorite ever
brush I'm gonna keep going back to my
Sigma e-40 brush I'm blending that in
now I'm going to go in with tangerine
the orange I made a little bit of melon
kind of mix them together and that's
gonna be our pop of color in the creeks
so I'm just gonna go over what I've just
done with the orange just starting from
the outer corner
we're gonna go in with gold leaf between
the vibrant bright gold on the nails for
takfir brush add that into the inner
corner area and halfway across the lid
this is the l'oreal infallible fixing
mess I'm just gonna spray a little bit
onto the brush just so we can pick up a
bit more pigment
it's a very inner corner I'm just going
to kind of mix a bit of a gold leaf with
any lighter shade really something like
chiffon here chiffon or Prosecco will do
that just needs a little brightening
this is where we're going to add the
blue quartz color
you don't want to look like you can
split your eye so I'm just patting the
blue over the edge of the gold if it
looks a bit more like a transitional
through and the orange is this uses a
crease I've just spent a bit of time
really working the color see would have
built the cause and the colors and blend
them all together the key is you don't
want the colors to look wishy-washy they
need to look really quite vibrant the
orange goes through the crease and over
the top all the way over to the gold
part it over gold just blends in
look it's more about the blue than it is
about that gold the goal is just kind of
like to the inner corner through a
little bit more color it's mainly about
the blue and the orange and that's it I
mean it took me a while to build the
colors and really get the colors really
bright and really vibrant and blended
together but when it works and it's done
I'm gonna use my nails Pro palette that
they've started doing and I've built up
a little collection here some blushes
highlight bronzer powder contour and
eyeshadows just gonna go in with the
powder just to set my under eyes we're
gonna use a bit of both of Laguna and
this contour shade together
I'm just watches an art to both I'm just
going to go in with the Real Techniques
blush brush start those not bronzer in
today
I'm gonna use if is alabaster I think
the highlight it's gonna use that on my
cheekbones golden shimmer to it and this
onto my eyebrow bone to so blush I'm
gonna go from each of these two I'm
pretty sure this is orgasm and this is
I'll leave it down below know what the
art it's gonna go for a mixture of those
then over top of that I'm just going to
go and look at my Laguna so what my
cheeks doing more Rumsey toned in the
are pink blend over the top
I'm just gonna add my eyebrows for my
usual shoujo Armani and also the I coat
brow gel now do that and I'll be back
with you well ah okay eyebrows don't
look it's coming together it's so nice
now I just need a new lip for my eyes
doing so
Aiko's black magic line up this what I
could to line my eyes
quick kill at my lashes a little lash
curl and adding for Clarence waterproof
mascara okay
now could leave that that what I'm gonna
add on some lashes so I'm gonna go for
the flare flare love lashes these are
just like nice outer corner ones so
these are perfect my far forefoot outer
corner lashes at the moment just using
some of the s Kyodo glue as always my
favorite
okay I'm just died as I was putting it
on that looks like quite a full tray
just an outer corner it's really really
pretty lashes on all I need now is some
lips so I'm gonna go for Clarins
lipliner in nude fair to start with
okay meanwhile things are just taking me
a long time shape some reason okay and
I'm gonna fill it in with the anastasia
beverly hills nude pure Hollywood lips
liquid lipstick just gonna go in one
last sweep of bronzer the final thing I
just want to quickly do is add some of
the blue underneath the eye it's really
close to the lash line and sweep up
towards damaged
thank you so much watching guys I really
really hope you enjoyed this I will see
you really really soon have an amazing
new year and take care bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
