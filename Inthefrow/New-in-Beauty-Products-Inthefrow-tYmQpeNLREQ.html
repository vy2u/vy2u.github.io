excited about this video it's not
something I've ever done before but it's
something else thinking about doing so
I'll see you're doing a similar video to
this and I thought you know i kinda want
to do on similar so as you've read in
the title this is going to be about new
in beauty products as you all know I am
a beauty blogger and a fashion blogger
and because of that I am extremely lucky
to work with a lot of different amazing
beauty brands that send me their newest
launches and releases for me to review
if you go onto my blog in the fro com
you'll see a lot of new products on
there that I'm able to review I'm
extremely looking at I feel extremely
grateful for that but it also means I
get to show you the latest products and
releases and tell you about the products
that you should be buying or perhaps you
shouldn't be that bothered about buying
so due to that I have quite a lot of new
products that I'd really like to talk to
you about a few of these I've tried and
a few of them in fact the majority of
them I haven't tried yet but I'm really
excited about them when I'm excited
about a new product it kind of means a
lot to me because I see so many new
products and launches so when I find one
products that i really think wow this is
awesome I kind of feel like it's going
to be pretty good so I'm going to try to
get through this as fast as possible
because it's quite a few things I'd like
to show you pretty much just to tell you
about new products are in the market and
why I'm pretty excited about them really
so let's dive straight in I'm going to
start with Barry n because Barry M is
sent me quite a few gorgeous new
products recently if you watch my recent
summer shimmer makeup tutorial you'll
have seen quite a few new berry on
products I actually really liked and
these are definitely talk with my list
of products I'm loving from them right
now Mariama pretty well known for their
nail polishes and these just scream
spring/summer to me so much these are
mostly fat from the middle one these are
from the quick dry range the speedy
quick dry really love this packaging
style it's gorgeous so here we have lap
of honour a lovely lilac we've got kiss
me quick beautiful baby Barbie pink this
is the jelly high shine nail paint this
is in the shade sugarplum that is my
kind of pink purple show
absolute doll that shade probably one of
my favorite colors are actually this was
very so much to baby pink except this
one has shimmery glitter in it and that
speed demon and here on the very end we
have turbocharged which is a coral with
shimmer yeah I'm just really excited
about wearing a lot of these for the
summer so I thought show you those next
up is a palette by pixie I'll be honest
when I first saw this in the packaging
it came in a green box the green of the
box really put me off this and I didn't
think it looked that great took out the
packaging have a look at it and then I
opened it up and straight away I was
like actually this looks really nice the
idea with this obviously is that you've
got a blush a very champagne bronzy
highlight and a bronzer and then you've
got light/medium darker and very dark
eyeshadow so here you've got 12 hours
shadows and everything else the actual
colors of these are so gorgeous I really
think that the pale green of the seedbox
doesn't do it justice and I think that
it takes away from the colors but
actually when I then starts watching
these I was like well sir these colors
are beautiful I was totally blown away
by it and especially this pink shade
here reminds me a lot of the Estee
Lauder blush tease it's got a really
shimmery glow to it like that so I'm
quite fond of this something from Tom
Ford as you know I do love it Tom
floored and the more premium products
this one is right on my street it's
absolutely beautiful it's in two parts
the top part comes off and in here we
have this rose gold shimmery cream
eyeshadow wow the pigmentation of this
is something else then when you put that
back on and you open the lid you have a
powder shimmer and the idea obviously is
that you take a little bit on your
finger and you begin to pass it over the
top of the cream and through doing so
you just get this
perfect mixture of cream with ultra
shimmer and I don't know she didn't even
see that in this light but it's
absolutely beautiful I cannot recommend
that more next up is bare minerals and
it's a new complexion rescue a lot of
people man talk about this and rightly
so I've used it once or twice now and
really really am impressed by it it's a
tinted hydrating gel cream I have it in
the shade vanilla which is brilliant
change for me and it's great for then
just bronzing over the top if I want to
be a little bit darker and I've also
used this just as a base and I'll go
over a little bit more foundation
concealer as well the idea though is
that you can add just a small layer and
it will help to really correct all of
your complexion get rid of any kind of
blemishes on dark circles or dark areas
on the thanks just leave you feeling so
much more wake and alive beautiful so
that if you didn't want to wear
foundation that today you didn't have to
you just have this on your skin instead
I had this this is a jared cosmetic bb+
illumination facial cream only recently
did I openness to give it a go there
wasn't too sure what it will also kind
of put it to one side a little bit
apprehensive but when I finally took it
out of the packet and spritzed a bit
onto my hand I was like wow this is what
she like liquid gold it's insane how
golden this is I think you could either
mix in with foundation if you want an
ultra-bright bronze golden shimmer a
finish to your makeup if you're going
out for the night winner perhaps not so
much in the day would say this would
also be beautiful to surprise the
cheekbones again if you go fat more
golden shimmer look or apply this all
over the face after moisturizer origin
in with your moisturizer all over face
before you apply foundation and your
foundation is obviously going to be so
much more glory and Rajon and bronzed
then it would be without this next up we
have some product I'm very very excited
about from the bomb I have never tried
the bar before I know ridiculous but
I've got some new products and extremely
excited about first up the mare
aluminized that i'm showing you this is
coming up what so many people rave about
this
favorite highlight ever I am equally
just as excited this is such a pretty
champagne gold that literally looks like
sunshine gold and on the cheeks that's
kind of so pretty in the sauna with a
tan I cannot wait now if it comes with
in there as well just don't want to
blind you so beautiful a compact cannot
wait this I thought was absolutely
adorable again from the bomb this is
called the Rockstar palette bon jovi
livin on a stair I love it so you open
it up like this oh and inside it says
rock and roll it's got his heart mirror
and it's got quite a lot of things so
it's got like Metallica Iron Maiden Led
Zeppelin Alice copper third eye blind it
REM stroke a blink 1982 but it's quite
cute and then here you've got a name
golden oh I'm pretty sure that split
like they're mary-lou manizer Ashley and
here you've got a lovely Oh peachy tone
blush and then down here you've also got
two little lipsticks but how cute is
that little palette seriously I was like
that is gorgeous i love that and equally
this the amount people i sees needle in
youtube videos i'm almost really really
jealous and wanted them and now i have
one this is nude nude nude nude
eyeshadow palette shadiness are amazing
going from a lovely bright bright
glistening white these are all there's a
cool nutz cushion miss couple of hours
but these are my kind of colors have got
some neutrals and bronzes and kotler's a
beautiful plum so that's beautiful it
cannot wait to try that all these
products by the way I'm sort of showing
you them now so that you can almost get
ready for them when I start using them
in makeup tutorials but I'm really
excited okay come our brands to go
starting with top and their new brush
range these are beautiful I mean first
of all these wooden handles with a gold
trimming around them really soft silky
hairs they don't look like the gun to de
multon too much and these are three of
my favorites so far they say what they
are on them no but this one
like a small rounded kabuki style brush
on the end long flat flat brush that I
use this morning contour and it was
perfect for contouring and because I
love my fluffy brushes this one is
double ended and it's got on one side
the equivalent to a map to 17 super
fluffy brush and this one is so sweet
it's like a little almost like an
eyeliner brush that we're perfect just
for adding some darkness until you felt
lower lash line so those three I'm very
excited about and you'll be seeing these
a lot more i'm sure a couple more from
kevin a quan this i cannot wait to try I
saw Jacqueline he'll use a super day
this is the candle lights list your
powder and she added it to the top of
cheeks and they just shone like the Sun
she looked stunning and that straight
away outside any bad I need that right
now this is very much quite well it's
quite similar to the mary lou lou
manizer but more champagne toned not
quite as golden perhaps more natural
just a little bit more natural with some
a cute little casing like a really cute
little case and another product from
kevin acquire this is the pure pound of
glow in natura natura again i think this
could be used to highlight but i know i
start using as a blush as well it's
really pretty it's more of a peach toned
peach champagne beige with some lovely
little speckles of gutter in there and
it gets really pretty so that's prolly
gonna use a lot more very soon these
really excited me when i got these out
of the bag this is a clinic Moisture
Surge face spray the thirsty skin relief
i love these kind of sprays the amount
of times I'll I've been out for meetings
or bin somewhere and get back to my desk
I'm out to sit down at my desk and I
just want to take off my makeup but I've
not got the time and just get out one of
these Hot Springs and I just start
spritz net all over my face mmm it just
helps to me vigor ate your skin
add a little bit more moisture back in
there just makes it feel so much my
brighter and fresher love these and also
I must say poor the products are most
excited about are these how cute are
these they're cliniques cheap pop this
one's a melon pop more of a coral and
this one is in pinkpop tomorrow baby

on the skin oh it's so pretty very very
similar color again to tease by a sale

people got oh this is gorgeous look
bones a lot and lastly in the more
affordable price bracket for any ladies
who like your drugstore makeup me me me
the amount of times I tried me me me and
each time I've been really impressed but
for reasons never stuck in my head as
being a brand to kill back to although I
need to remember to because we've got
some fantastic products these are so
good they're fully some of the best
pigments I've ever used by light bliss
I've got here and really I see lilac
light blue can you see that tangled IV
which is almost a pearlescent she will
chrome green and look a deep
thats stolen the pigmentation is
beautiful they almost feel velvety here
I've also got the shade define a note
will a whisper willow whisper and this
is a again champagne with a bronze

recommendations of this whole video so
far also pretty excited about these

gorgeous actually and I'm calm so much
product to my house right now burnt
umber burnt umber so one sack arm is

for me quite similar to the by Terry I

beauty products that I'm really really
excited about literally everything that
I've featured in this I'm really excited
to get working with and using like said
throughout many products these days
