excited about this video it's not
something I've ever done before but it's
something else thinking about doing
saucy you're doing a similar video to
this and I thought you know I kinda want
to do on similar so as you've read in
the title this is going to be about new
in beauty products as you all know I am
a beauty blogger and a fashion blogger
and because of that I am extremely lucky
to work with a lot of different amazing
beauty brands that send me their newest
launches and releases for me to review
if you go on to my blog in the fro comm
you'll see a lot of new products on
there that I'm able to review I'm
extremely looking and I feel extremely
grateful for that but it also means I
get to show you the latest products and
releases and tell you about the products
that you should be buying or perhaps you
shouldn't be that bothered about buying
so due to that I have quite a lot of new
products that I'd really like to talk to
you about a few of these I've tried and
a few of them in fact the majority of
them I haven't tried yet
but I'm really excited about them when
I'm excited about a new product it kind
of means a lot to me because I see so
many new products and launches so when I
find one products that I really think
wow this is awesome I kind of feel like
it's going to be pretty good so I'm
gonna try to get through this as fast as
possible because it's quite a few things
I'd like to show you pretty much just to
tell you about new products are in the
market and why I'm pretty excited about
them really so let's dive straight in
I'm gonna start with Barry Anne because
Barry M has sent me quite a few gorgeous
new products recently if you watch my
recent summer shimmer
makeup tutorial you'll have seen quite a
few new baryon products I actually
really liked and these I've definitely
talked with my list of products I'm
loving from them right now Baram are
pretty well known for their nail
polishes and these just scream
spring/summer to me so much these are
mostly packed in the middle one these
are from the quick dry range the speedy
quick dry really love this packaging
style it's gorgeous so here we have lap
of Honor a lovely lilac we've got to
kiss me quick
beautiful baby Barbie pink
this is the jelly high shine nail paint
this is in the shade sugar plum that is
my kind of pink purple shade that's what
y'all about shade probably one of my
favorite colors actually this one is
very similar to the baby pink except
this one has a shimmer glitter in it and
that speed demon and here on the very
end we have turbo charge which is a
coral with shimmer yeah I'm just really
excited about wearing a lot of these for
the summer so I thought I'd show you
those next up is a palette by pixie I'll
be honest when I first saw this in the
packaging it came in a green box the
green of the box really put me off this
and I didn't think it looked that great
took it out the packaging have a look at
it and then I opened it up and straight
away I was like actually this looks
really nice the idea with this obviously
is that you've got a blush a very
champagne bronze II highlight and a
bronzer and then you've got light medium
darker and very dark eye shadows so here
you've got 12 Irish a dough's and
everything else the actual colors of
these are so gorgeous I really think
that the pale green of the state box
doesn't do it justice and I think that
it takes away from the colors but
actually when I then started watching
these I was like wow these colors are
beautiful I was totally blown away by it
and especially this pink shade here
reminds me a lot of the Estee Lauder
blush tease it's got a really shimmery
glow to it like that so I'm quite fond
of this something from Tom Ford as you
know I do love it Tom Ford and them are
premium products this one is right at my
street it's absolutely beautiful it's in
two parts the top part comes off and in
here we have this rose gold shimmery
cream eye shadow Wow
the pigmentation of this is something
else and then when you put that back on
and you open this little lid you have a
powder shimmer
and the idea obviously is that you take
a little bit on your finger and you
begin to pass it over the top
the cream and through doing so just get
this perfect mixture of cream with ultra
shimmer and I don't know she doesn't
even see that in this light but it's
absolutely beautiful I cannot recommend
that more next up is Ben minerals and
it's a new complexion rescue a lot of
people men talk about this and rightly
so
I've used it once or twice now and
really really are impressed by it
it's a tinted hydrating gel cream I have
it in the shade vanilla which is a
brilliant change for me and it's great
for then just bronzing up the top if I
want to be a little bit darker and I've
also used this just as a base and I'll
go over a little bit more foundation and
concealer as well
the idea though is that you can add just
a small layer and it will help to really
correct all of your complexion get rid
of any kind of blemishes or dark circles
or dark areas on the face just leave you
feeling so much more awake and alive and
beautiful so that if you didn't want to
wear foundation that today you didn't
have to and you just have this on your
skin instead I had this this is a gerard
cosmetics vb+ illumination facial cream
only recently did I open s to give it a
go because I wasn't too sure what it
will also kind of put it to one side
it's a little bit apprehensive but when
I finally took it out of the packet and
spritzed a bit onto my hand I was like
wow this is what she like liquid gold
it's insane how golden this is I think
you could either mix in with foundation
if you want an ultra bright bronze
golden shimmery finish to your makeup if
you're going out for the night winner
perhaps not so much in the day would say
this would also be beautiful to
subscribe to the cheekbones again if you
got that more golden shimmer look oh
apply this all over the face after
moisturizer origin in with you
moisturizer all over the face before you
apply foundation and your foundation is
obviously going to be so much about
glowy and radiant and Brahms then it
would be without this next up we have
some product I'm very very excited about
from the balm I have never tried the bar
before I know ridiculous but I've got
some new products and extremely excited
about first up the mary-lou manizer I'm
showing
coming up but so many people rave about
this as their favorite highlight ever I
am equally just as excited this is such
a pretty champagne gold that literally
looks like sunshine gold and on the
cheeks that's kind of so pretty in the
Sun or with a tan I cannot wait now it
comes with a mirror as well
I don't want to blind you so beautiful a
compact cannot weigh this I thought was
absolutely adorable again from the balm
this is called the Rockstar palette bomb
Jovi
living on a stair I love it so you open
it up like this and inside it says
rock-and-roll it's got his heart and
mirror and it's got quite a lot of thing
it's got like Metallica Iron Maiden oh
and settlin Alice copper third I blinded
REM stroke a blink 1982 but it's quite
cute and then here you've got and then
golden oh I'm pretty sure that's polite
there mary lou manizer actually and here
you've got a lovely Oh peachy toned
blush and then down here you've also got
two little lipsticks how cute is that
little palette seriously I was like that
is gorgeous I love that and equally this
the amount of people I see use needle in
YouTube videos and I was really really
jealous and wanted them and now I have
one this is nude nude nude nude
eyeshadow palette shadiness are amazing
going from a lovely bright bright
glistening white these are all well
that's closer miss couple nuts but these
are my kind of colors have got some
neutrals and bronzes and coppers a
beautiful plum so that's beautiful I
cannot wait to try that all these
products by the way I'm sort of showing
you them now so that you can almost get
ready for them when I start using them
in makeup tutorials but I'm really
excited
okay come our brands to go starting with
top and their new brush range these are
beautiful I mean first of all these
wooden handles with the gold trimming
around them really soft silky hair
they don't look like the gun to the
malting too much and these are three of
my favorites so far they say what they
are on them no but this one looks like a
small rounded kabuki style brush on the
end long flat flat brush that I use this
morning for contour and it was perfect
for contouring and because I love my
fluffy brushes this one is double ended
and it's got on one side the equivalent
to a map-21 7 super fluffy brush and
this one is so sweet it's like a little
almost like an eyeliner brush that we're
perfect just for adding some darkness
until you felt lower at lashline so
those three I am very excited about and
you'll be seeing these a lot more I'm
sure a couple more from Kevin a Kwan
this I cannot wait to try I saw Jaclyn
hill use a super day this is the candle
lights list your powder and she added it
to the top for cheeks and they just
shone like the Sun she looked stunning
and that straight away I was like I need
that I need that right now this is very
much quite well it's quite similar to
the mary lou manizer but more champagne
toned not quite as golden perhaps more
natural just a little bit more natural
but in the cute this little casing right
a really cute little case and another
product from Kevin aqua this is a pure
pound of glow and Natura natural again I
think this could be used to highlight
but I know I start using as a blush as
well it's really pretty it's more of a
peach toned peach champagne beige with
some lovely little speckles of butter in
there and again it's really pretty so
that's probably gonna use a lot more
very soon these really excite me when I
got this out of the bag this is a clinic
wants to search face spray the thirsty
skin relief I love these kind of sprays
the amount of times I'll I've been out
for meetings or bin somewhere and I'd
get back to my desk I'm out to sit down
at my desk and I just want to take off
my makeup but I've not got the time and
just get out one of these hot sprays and
I just start spritzing it all over my
face
it just helps to we vigor ate your skin
just add a little bit more moisture back
in there just makes it feel so much like
brighter and fresher love these and also
I must say products are most excited
about ah these how cute are these
they're Clinique's cheap pop this one's
a melon pop more of a coral and this one
is in pink pop tomorrow baby pink baby
pink I am all about right now feels so
creamy and then when it goes on the skin
oh it's so pretty very very similar
cooler again
Tootie's buy us a large at that very
famous blush that so many people got oh
this is gorgeous
love those a lot and lastly in the more
affordable price bracket for Annie
ladies who like your drugstore makeup
mimimi the amount of times I tried me me
me and each time I've been really
impressed but the reasons never stuck in
my head as being a brand to go back to
although I need to remember to because
we've got some fantastic products these
are so good there's probably some of the
best pigments I've ever used by light
bliss I've got here and really I see
lilac light blue can you see that
tangled Ivy which is almost a
pearlescent she will cream green and
look at deep that is a stunning the
pigmentation is beautiful they almost
feel velvety here I've also got the
shade define a note
willow whisper willow whisper and this
is a again champagne bronze probably one
of the biggest recommendations of this
whole video so far also pretty excited
about these these are in the enchanted
eyes dual ended
eye ones this one especially looks
gorgeous actually and I've got so much
product to my hands right now
burnt umber burnt umber so marsac arm is
completely covered in products this is
such a creamy pencil
absolutely beautiful so creamy so
blendable these would be for me quite
similar to the by terry eyeshadows do
they have it so many new beauty products
that I'm really really excited about
literally everything that I've featured
in this I'm really excited to get
working with and using like I said
throughout many products these days
really really Wow me but these were
particularly exciting when I open them
up so I hope this give me a bit of an
idea of what's new in the market and
won't you potentially could have a
little lock out and maybe starts
