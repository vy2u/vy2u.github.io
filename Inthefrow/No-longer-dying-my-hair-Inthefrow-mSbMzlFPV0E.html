my last Q&amp;amp;A video so I asked on
instagram and on Twitter for you guys to
use hashtag ask Victoria and ask me some
questions so I'm gonna answer a few of
those for you now okay so for this
question okay when the answer something
Instagram for purpose and then I'll go
to Twitter so these are Instagram this
is from twisted heartstrings whereabouts
did you go up I've been trying to
pinpoint where your accent is from it's
so cute oh thanks a lot of people asked
for this a lot of people know that I'm
northern but they can't quite pinpoint
it I'm from Wigan which is a little very
working-class town and it's about 40
minutes away from Manchester Lena or
discovery underscore asks where would
you want to go if you could grow up
again other than where you actually did
grow up I would probably say I would
like to grow up in San Francisco awesome
City that would just be so cool being
able to kind of hang out around the
caterpillar area a lot and then just a
place to live
otherwise maybe somewhere like LA it's
got the beautiful beaches like Orange
County kind of area and if not then
probably just down south and quite a
mess of people that live down south who
have kind of grown up with roots and
London or the seminaries like right
there cuz this looks so nice and it's
quite hard to ever treat yourself from
the north and move the south so Lauren
Howell XO asks if you could model for
any of your favourite clothes and rams
which one would you pick to model for
probably goes for something quite
high-end kind of quite a bit more than
now for a few different brands which is
so much fun but I'd love to do some
high-end modeling things like mulberry
Prada Dolce Gabanna
you know there's kind of high-end luxury
brands because they're advertising and
their imagery is always so incredible
that'd be awesome Alice under Scott M or
a score scale asks what is your favorite
film and which ones would you request
which ones would I recommend my top
three favorite films think about my
mention this before what my top three
favorite films are the fountain true
romance and Forrest Gump
but police say my top five often please
hook so sadly Robin Williams recently
died I was actually really upset it
looked cry about it
remember it's amazing films my childhood
so hook he's definitely in the top five
and probably something like Shawshank
Redemption it's an awesome film
maybe like castaway is amazing Lena
underscore haloa it's the last day
before the world ends what would your
last meal be scary question that's me
there would have to be starters
chicken-liver paté because I'm addicted
to it a meal would probably be a roast
beef roast dinner you need all the
trimmings Yorkshire puddings duck fat
roast potatoes I'm some passionate
sprouts
mash with creamed a lot desserts will
probably have to be chocolate fudge I
make the nicest dark chocolate fudge is
incredible and it's one my favorite
things that police say - chocolate fudge
and it would have to be with a bottle of
Prosecco and possibly some light straw
but look you ought to go in it circle
make Bellinis Nicole 1988 asks is there
a particular concealer you would
recommend for dark circles please I
would highly recommend the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer it stays put all day
hence right cord longer find it the
coverage is incredible and it mixes so
well with foundation
I think it's amazing and also Mac prep
and prime I found to be incredible for
me lightning so creating all the
highlight underneath the eyes and really
banishing dark circles I definitely
recommend those two for cheaper
alternative though I'd also recommend
the Rimmel wake me up concealer and also
the collection mm concealer as everyone
always says but they are really really
good
obviously it's lower that asks how often
do you read eye your hair if you dye my
hair every nine weeks or so people are
often really shocked when I say that
because I think that I must have to read
I every two weeks get the color that's
not true my hair some reason seems to
SAP up this color amazingly so I go a
dark purple and then over the weeks and
weeks and weeks weeks it will fade to a
lighter line a color I only wash my hair
every five days four or five days or so
so I do keep it that way if you're a
person who dies heal up who likes to dye
hair and washes your hair every single
day you might think we have to keep the
color because you're washing it too much
and you the heat and the products are
going to strip your hair a very thin
else's on them so if you want to have a
diet colored hair like this then you
need to really change your routine and
make your washing pattern much more
lengthy bring a clip glue our favorite
animal
favorite animal it would definitely have
to be a polar bear I absolutely adore
polar bears I donate to the read through
us every month realize a very feisty and
I've killed a lot of people but they are
beautiful creatures
live s onion 21 asks if you could do a
collab with any other youtuber who would
it be
that would probably definitely have to
be Joe and Caspar because recently I've
been watching Joe's YouTube whispers
videos and they are actually hilarious
this one the best YouTube video ever
seen they're just I literally was just
crying laughing is so funny
so I'd love to do one of those with
those guys they just look like they have
so much fun in that flat yeah that'd be
hilarious okay so I'm going over to
Twitter let's see what people on Twitter
have been asking Claire sees Beauty asks
if you could only have one perfume to
Earth rest your life which one would you
choose and why I would easily say that
would be Victor and Ralph Flowerbomb
extreme a little purple 50 ml bottle I
just find it's the most beautiful mature
and flattering perfume for me I love it
yeah underscore miss TG f right I'm
afraid to dye my hair because I'm afraid
it will be dried out and ruined how does
yours look so lush and fabulous well
thank you very much Sarah I would say I
use a lot of very well quite expensive
products and luxury hair products
because I like to take care of my hair
and I find that more cheaper
alternatives don't quite do the same
thing for me so you thought TG products
such as they're serious conditioners I
think Moroccan oil on the ends all the
time I use GHD volume volumizers I use
all bay texturizers and I just find that
it works really really well for me I'm
also very Michael at her anyway so I'm
not having to really reach once bleach I
use a very light Islamic bleach on my
hair before my salon also then dyed it
purple so yeah I would just say invest
in some really good quality harold's
which is Moroccan
happy Rock Nile and also some really
good shampoos conditioners as well
because I recently used some really
cheap ones from pad ten and my hair felt
horrible afterwards so horrible so I
know always stick with what I know and
that's poor Mitchell TG and also Vader
at TLC underscore Bobby asks that what
was your first job my first job was as a
pop washer yes so luxurious I was a pop
washer at a pub called the barbers arms
and it was my first job I worked as a
pop wash and then I on so Frannie was
pop washing Saturday I worked as a
commis chef and some days I worked as a
waitress so I was doing three different
jobs I loved it it was an awesome job I
had a really cool white team of people I
worked with my arms look back on those
days and I'm like that was such a cool
team to work in and I love going to work
and yeah taught me a lot
Tasha Jane underscore our hate asks
would you rather live without lipstick
or hair dye it depends if I could have a
lip balm if I could have a lip balm I
probably go with dyeing my hair if I
couldn't have any lip products and I'd
have to go with lip products and have
mousy brown hair I love lip products
it's one thing I wear every single day
regardless of where I'm wearing makeup
or not I will always have lip balm on or
comics or some sort of lip color I've
always been obsessed with lipsticks ever
since I was in high school from about
the age of 12
lipstick filament bosses were my kind of
thing but at the same time I hate to my
natural hair color which is a mousy
brownie blonde
now no I have no idea because I've dyed
my hair for 14 years now so I'm not sure
what its pretty if I come out to brown I
don't think I could go back to that and
love it again so I'll choose lipsticks
calm easy big Vanessa asks me how do you
feel about your blog readers do you
recognize the same ones posting all the
time hint hint
yes when it's that I notice you all the
time
Vanessa always comment on all of my
youtube videos every single blog post

got the top spot yeah no I do I know

youtube channel a lot and a lot of
people that comment on mine so grandma I
dunno if you I might get quite a few
comments and it might be hard for me to
always reply to every single one but I
