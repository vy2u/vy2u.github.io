programme and I'm just going first by
the way yeah just a scandal and scream
queens so if you watched I know oh my
god they are so good so both very very
different TV programs and they're both
on in the US by kind of just stream them
online and making a massive jingling
list I suppose you're pretty much ingles
the ones kind of very like American
politics but not but kind of however you
know how to explain it's quite serious
and drama REE and then scream queens is
like Mean Girls pretty little liars and
scary movie and loads and loads of
really weird films mixed together so
it's just like a piss take of like an a
teenage American horror film basically
it's like based around a sorority and
Emma Roberts plays the lead kind of
character the leaf its net and she is my
hero i would say i would say the new
james bond what was it called specter
specter bounty the only thing about it
was the Wardrobe in it the female leads
wardrobe was amazing they were like
Chloe bags then I was just like yeah the
Wardrobe was beautiful no idea why did
really like it i would definitely
recommend seeing it if you're gone far
are you like that kind of thing I didn't
hate it like I just didn't enjoy it as
much as the others so I would recommend
seeing as well as yet your favorite
photo of the month I actually have one
which relates to my
dancer and I was just really happy that
I had the opportunity to caption this
photo with this and I basically i just
got a starbucks and alex took a photo be
holding said starbucks but I captioned
it with I'll have a trenta no-foam
five-shot half-caf no foam pumpkin spice
latte with no foam at 210 degrees if you

clip and after this because it's just
everything it makes money that what you
asked for no you're like okay learn to
become flexing my coffees oh this is

have to yeah control Victoria thought
I'd like to go to anything off the wall

photo is this one I'll put up a scribe
well we're gonna have to put the photos
over each other's faces because there's
no space go over Suzie's face right now
in her photo and this is the photo of
meet with Rita Ora wearing the beautiful
bowel man jacket that I really wanted
and then get my hands on although I was
wearing a chambelan on there so I can't
really say it was like a nice little 20
photo yeah this was really nice so this
was at the unicef halloween ball it was
a couple weeks ago and we were raising
money obviously for the syrian children
it's an amazing event it was so nice to
be part of it and i was chatting to some
of the people on the red carpet what
their ways 1.6 million that night that's
amazing yeah it was made it apart but
and it was just so nice to get this
picture Miri to as well she's such a
babe that's like once in a lifetime yeah
that was pretty cool favorite person of
the month favorite person this is the
one I really struggle with because I
have like a whole handful of people that
my favorite pupils people's this mandala
and just because I had a really down
period at the beginning of this month
when I felt really sad and like
Victorian message screen just like you
okay and my friend live from what Olivia
did message me being like you okay and
alex was just always you know she's
she's always that she's look on my back
and I've seen Amelia this month and that
was really nice so all of those people
will link them in the description box
that they've liked them really
supportive and lovely and I feel like
there's probably going to be someone
I've missed out and I'm going to feel
awful
but yeah favorites hey thank you my
favorite person of the month is a very
very good friend of mine and she's good
friend of ours oh oh let's uses okay
thank you Cheers fine yes so M um yes
she's a really good friend of her as
well yeah i'll gladly sit together but
I've known em since I first start
blogging and she threw a Manchester
blogger party and it was very first
event I ever went to and she was so like
welcoming and yeah she was just great
and simply saying but she's found I'll
leave her link down below if she'd ever
go to follow her and her blog is amazing
she's a lovely as person and she's
always there for me well yeah we love
that we love him favorite piece of
clothing this month favorite piece of
clothing in addition to my dress which
is hmmm balm on which I love I never
thought shoulder pads would work on me
but they kind of do look at aside from
that this coat I have been absolutely
obsessed with I finally have it and it
took me a while to track down in
Brighton because Brighton stores not as
good as the London ones but it's
obviously love ya ass gorgeous face ok
I'm going to say this jacket now there
are plenty of alternatives on the high
street oh yeah if you write your
designer stuff then it's my burberry
trench I really like it'sit's got the
boom remember everything inside a really
classic if you're tiny banana republic
do these but like perfect size personal
thing yes they also have a very tool
section but they're very kind of cater
for the tool yes well that's it we're
burberry there's three different lengths
it took me about an hour and a half to
pick this one three different lengths of
three different colors and there's three
different style so there's nine
different options available Wow but I
went for the medium stone trench so over
knitwear when you just want something
like a light jog yeah this is really
breaks it's not too especially when
you're in London some days London is
really warm and sundays on it is
freezing so this is like perfect to the
a warm days where you can just lay there
yeah and if its raining its really
really great favourite way that you
spent your free time ok so this month I
kind of so far up until filming this I
haven't really been out too much like
two different events and things like
that so I would say just like the law
kind of dog walks I've been on its
really nice than autumnal and bright at
the moment the leaves have finally
dropped some reason the leaves in London
we're dropping like two months ago and
they've only just dropped in Brighton
it's weird climate down there but it's
finally gotta embroidered and I've just
been on lots of dog walks just like out
in the fresh air which has been really
nice and very refreshing and I'm now
like ready to come back to work Mike oh
that's so nice I wish I had a dog I'd
say the Fate way I spent my time until I
place a in with Alex because recently I
felt really less stressed than a house
yes I've been feeling really really good
recently which means that I don't argue
as much of that like so I'll get like
annoyed as much so I feel a much less
much more like Calm been so much nicer
just kind of stay with Alex in the flat
and just feel like a donee to work and I
can just kind of take the night off make
some food while we order in and watch
hell's kitchen that we will of Hell's
Kitchen watch I'll get you an animal de
slight chill in the flat this has been
really nice and pop that handles on its
like the flats completely clean it's
just like I feel so relaxed ah favorite
food at the mall favorite food throw it
in stopwatch myths and did it mattered
like chocolate hall and you know when
you're going for one thing I went in for
Tonya's glamour magazine oh yeah and I
just ended up buying Lizard chocolate
