doing so so well welcome for the first
time if it's the first time he's ever
seen my channel before I guess I should
introduced myself I'm Victoria this is
in fro this is my fashion beauty
lifestyle Travel YouTube channel it's
nice to meet you today is gonna be
another one of my favorites videos my
October favorites and new in products
like I did for September this is just a
bit of a mix up of the generic
favourites kind of tag I'm just going to
go through everything that I really
really loved for October and also tell
you about a few products are brand new
in that I've not really used as much yet
and therefore they aren't favorites but
they kind of blew me away when I saw
them and i swatched them and when I saw
them I saw my god these are incredible
so it's kind of nice gonna give you my
absolute favorites as well as some
things I think might become favorites
ahead of time so let's get into it as I
did in my last video I'm gonna sort of
show you me applying a lot of these
products as we go along because I kind
of want to give you a real insight into
how they work how I use them so when I
start off as far with this skincare I
guys please don't hate on me for this
okay I'm gonna show you a brand I've
never actually show it on my youtube
channel or my blog before but I've only
recently been introduced to them myself
in terms of using their products and
I've been so blown away I really really
wanted to mention them but when it comes
to skincare they are notoriously one of
the most expensive skincare brands
lemare i've been recommended them so
many times by friends in the past and i
knew they were gonna be great so this is
what i've been doing i've been mixing
the moisturizing soft cream from the man
this is 30 ml this is 110 pounds so I've
been mixing the moisturizing soft cream
with a bit of the renewal oil so
jarowair this helps to soften the skin
it will help to reduce lines and
wrinkles it adds so much vitality and
glow back into the skin it really kind
of helps renew it off dual sallow skin
so I think that I do with lemare is that
they have this miracle broth that's made
up of lots of different sea sauced
actives as they call it so different
ingredients that they have sought from
the sea to create a miracle broth which
is kind of like their trademark special
ingredient it's a bit like coca-cola how
they never tell you what's inside it so
it's all about renewal youthfulness
four youthful skin now I'm pretty sure
this is a 30 mil bottle think it will be
this is a hundred and sixty pound but
now I've been using it every morning for
the past month and a half and it's only
gone down this much literally use two
three drops a day so this actually will
last me some time this is a hundred and
ten and I am oh my gosh nearly in the
bottom yeah that's not last quite as
long they are so hydrating and
moisturizing and when I mix them
together the oil mixes with the
moisturizer and adds the most incredible
glow into my skin but these just this
kind of looking duo I've been doing my
skin just goes like pow so bright so
glowy so chewy and ultra hydrated my
skin does feel so much better recently
apart from this guy here he's come out
through the dress I think
but generally absolutely incredible but
then it was a top I think this is
actually a favorite of Kim Kardashian
actually as well
it's a creme de la Mer perfecting
treatment which you can't there big
launch I think recently this is almost
like a primer so it's a gorgeous gel
solution and I've been using this again
over the top of this space mixing it in
over my office my cheeks onto my
forehead and also my chin generally
everywhere but mainly focusing there and
honestly I've been finding so much of a
difference my makeup I can put on my
makeup in a day with this and then ten
o'clock at night it's still perfect so
honestly I have been really believing in
this I am a big supporter of this now
and again this is about 120 pound to buy
so these are the top of the kind of
skincare I scale I'm sure there's some
slightly above it but these are
generally one of the top four
potentially for maybe a really expensive
Christmas president or something just to
try out if you have to go in and maybe
get a little sample I'll leave it that
okay so next up is base and last time I
mentioned the urban decay flawless
foundation think it's called and also
the hourglass vanish foundation which
I'm still kind of playing around with
absolutely love both of those my feet
are going completely non right now okay
that's better but that have been another
two that I it's been the four of them
all together I've been playing around
with first of all the NARS Velvet Matte
skin tint I have this in Alaska
this is just it's kind of like a tinted
moisturizer but I feel with a little bit
more flawless coverage to it I mean it
is skin tint after all and it does seem
velvet matte but I also feel it isn't as
mattifying as you'd expect which is
probably why I really love it because I
don't really like matte foundations but
this I still feel maybe it's because of
the lemare products underneath that look
at that ultra glow but mixing this over
top kind of gives me the best of both
worlds I think I get the glow from
underneath I also get the kind of
staying power of a matte foundation and
the color is so perfect for me it's kind
of my tan shade but not my ultra tan
shade so I can use this generally most
of the time honestly it's really
fantastic it's just a little bit second
the normal tinted moisturizer with great
flawless coverage and a little kind of
glowing matte finish up say not Julie
but kind of glowing matte but then I've
also been playing around with the
L'Oreal nude magic cushion which I think
I've kind of mentioned a few times
recently but these really are so so good
I'm pretty sure I have shade three here
because when you take off the tag on
them that's what has the shade number on
them so that's the one flaw with this
packaging it needs to say the shade
number because it doesn't unless I'm
dismissing it I think this is number
three I've kind of gone through all the
different shades and as a girl darker
matter that's better for me well it's
just a cushion formula which means it's
really good for travel too you can
actually take out on the plane and I
just literally pounce my Beauty Blender
into this and then over the face and
that boosts off mixing these two
together so I've been applying a bit
base and then a bit of this mixing the
two because this does add furriness and
glow is so wonderful for Julie finish
it's a little less than flawless
coverage it's kind of a medium like to
medium coverage and then this one just
gives a little bit more coverage so the
two together are wonderful but on days
from my skin's looking really great and
I'm not many blemishes and it's looking
quite even and I put this over it it
just really helps to perfect so I find
that if you have quite good skin and you
have a good skin day this is kind of
like the best thing you can put on it so
it's not too thick it's not too heavy
but it'll just accentuate and just
increase how beautiful your skin looks
that day but oh my god so good together
gosh I feel like I'm describing things
there's so much detail here it's taking
me ages okay so next up is an eyeshadow
palette that I have been using non-stop
and a little obviously
with this and I haven't mentioned it
anywhere yet so I couldn't wait to
mention actually I've been wearing it
and every single picture probably Semien
as well as my last video it's a new
zoeva
caramel melange palette this is autumn
in a palette for me it's so fantastic
every single color here I could use more
than happily so on my eyes today I went
in with the universal delight just a
super easy sort of brown tan quite light
shade and then I've either been going in
with 182 degrees see this one here she's
almost like a rose gold or liquid Center
this is almost like a caramel rose and
this is like a real rose copper gold and
it's so pigmented they're like ultra
finally shadows they're so just
wonderfully pigmented and I use these
even without a wet brush do you read
something what a wet brush could do with
these I think it would be absolutely
insane but the pigmentation of these is
wonderful as soon as you put them onto
your brush onto your eye it just comes
straight off onto your brush like the
transfer it's wonderful and the colors
are so glowy and autumnal beautiful
sobbing put this on my eye or either one
of those depending on the day and then
I'll go back with with aftertaste which
is this gorgeous kind of coral red
alchemy and also start soft which is
both kind of burnished brown reds and
I've been taking the three of those and
then working them further into the
creases to really sort of deepen up the
shades and and then I'll go in with a
bit of wax paper the white and just put
that in my inner corner so a full out on
the look from this one palette and
there's so many other kind of looks you
could create here I mean the purple with
the gold this darker Brown is another
one I'm sure I'll be going for it soon
you know it's a scourge it looks like a
beautiful palette the one thing I wish
your hand was in mirror but other than
that it's so brilliant I could not
recommend this more I'm just gonna
mention now a new in product because I
use this in my routine just gonna show
you what it was how pretty is this new
Tarte palette this is the Iron Sheik
palette I think it's kind of yeah the
rainforest of the sea palette how pretty
so it has a mirror yay and it has six
different eyeshadow shades and also a
blush mystifies so I use mystified today
it's my kind of shade very sort of muted
nude
that's going to share like some minutes
just a bit darker than your natural skin
tone that adds a bit more kind of nude
pink that's my kind of thing and there's
six different to shimmers and also for
matte shades in here
but all very very wearable shades all
nicely pigmented yes so I think this is
gonna be a kind of best seller
soon to be honest so inmost heart
palettes are bestsellers but I wanted to
show you that as well and I used that
with one of my new favorite brushes this
is a makeup forever professional 1:52
wavy it says I'm not sure it's just a
very rounded top brush and I've been
loving this for contouring so I put on
my contour this morning with this using
the iconic London palette and then I
dipped into the Tarte palette for the
blush and put that on as well if this is
just the perfect kind of fit for my face
in terms what kind of underneath my
cheeks and around everywhere and I was
fine it blends so beautifully without
giving any streaks or without making
everything a bit too soft big and
over-the-top you know it just it's
really great so then I went in with
another product which is kind of in my
new in products and to recommend this is
from Tom Ford of course Milliken
goddesses and it's their new palette so
this has a blush a highlight and four
different shades now this is one pricey
palette a key I mean the pigmentation of
these is absolutely gorgeous stunning so
again I went in with the brush and just
took a bit of this kind of highlight tea
feels a little bit creamy but it's
generally more powder and it's a very
light champagne pink that's beautiful so
I added that on to my cheekbones and
everywhere else as well so as much to
mention I think it's actually beautiful
and finally to my face asked the
products I haven't used as much yet I
want you to mention them because the
shade range of these is really fantastic
I've been really loving every single one
really they're all really beautiful but
the three main ones that I like not even
mention what these are so the new Mac
lip density lipsticks and these are my
three favorite shades out of their whole
shade range so you've got dough which is
what I use today
as you will see me applying it I have
here medium rare which is a beautiful
muted pink these are just a kind of my
shades or what I would choose and this
one's Moscow and this is called
driftwood and it's a stony touch of
lilac in there but generally a stone
shade so I thought these be quite
popular anyway but for me they are my
top three but this is really really nice
it's the first time I've tried it on I
thought it'd be really nice with the eye
makeup it just feels very smooth not at
all drying my lips kind of feel quite
nice and plumped and large this is a
really lovely shade color so I'm quite
fond on that actually I wanted to
mention these as new from Mac as well
okay I really need to mention these
products I'm so in love with this range
the girl kind of miniatures range so
adorable these are seriously the travel
companion of travel companions I have
these now in my travel back whenever I
go traveling and as you know I think
I've done about 55 flights this year
which is looking the same and the
majority of those were long haul so I've
learned now what I need in my sort of
little travel back inside my handbag and
I've managed to whittle it down to some
incredible products and the main ones I
really need to mention are these from
Cologne cause he's a count of all I need
now in my travel bag
they are so brilliant and then adorable
I'm a little cocky so I start off taking
off all my makeup generally I have
Clarins little miniature Clarence with
me then I'll palm some of this top spot
this is almost like a blemish corrector
it's a bit of a green concealer shade so
it looks a bit like a beige concealer
with some green tones in it really so
you can just add it on over top you
spots and it will almost kind of conceal
them out but this contains a number of
ingredients are great for drying out
spots and reducing how red they are as
well so I find that I kind of put these
on on top of spots when I'm on the plane
and my first on my journey and by the
enflame journey they just look a little
less angry and they've almost been kind
of capsulated
inside of this formula so they're not
getting too dry and even more irritated
in the aircon
so I'll put it on first then I'll go in
with some Regents in a flash this is
instant radiance and tightening I don't
use this every single time
but when my skin is looking quite dull
I'll put this on this is a golden sort
of liquid pearlescent golden kind of
liquid and yeah that does kind of I have
that onto the skin and it just brightens
it it also helps to kind of tying it up
a little bit as well and just have some
agents into that so all those add that
I'll just kind of give myself a little
bit of a facelift for the start of the
plane journey and then I'll go over top
with submit night secret and this is
literally the dreamiest product I've
mentioned before the girl and midnight
secretly used to have a larger bottle
which smelled like violet they've
changed the formulation now made it into
a much smaller little tiny tube and it
now smells more lavender but the overall
effects of this are exactly the same it
is my one and only plain moisturizer now
mainly because I mean look at size it's
perfect but also it packs a punch like
the effects of this are so wonderful it
sinks into my skin so beautifully and my
face is more hydrated when I come out of
play and then it was when I went on the
plane this just really has so many
wonderful active ingredients in there
that just wear can Waylon skin whilst
you are on new plate what is this fly
the amount of times I've been on a plane
and I've looked in the mirror in the
bathroom and my face almost looks like
it's just like ah you know like super
dry and awful and then I'll put some of
this on and it looks absolutely
incredible so these are honestly
wonderful and there's also a lip product
as well but that is next to my bed I
don't want to move right now so yeah but
the lips mutes called secret lip secret
again that's part this range and it's so
brilliant so those are my secret weapon
okay now this is getting on for super
long now but there's a few more things I
mentioned this perfume the Giorgio
Armani
sea leper farm this is the first perfume
it's nearly gone now it's a first
perfume I have finished in years and
years and years because I get so many
different perfumes to try out I never
really ever get to the end of them and I
have one so I really love and I use the
most but I never Lee find that I finish
them but because I have walnuts every
single day now for the past month or so
I mean I've interchangeable for you like
the wire cell I can mention one page
which is absolutely stunning this has
been the other one that I've been
wearing pretty much all the time I took
this on holiday to Boston I took it to
the maldives it was my one and only for
those trips and it is my free
it's cent now absolutely well I mean
Victor and Ralph are bomb may still be
up their butts just pull a close second
the thing with this one it's the leper
farm so it's Seymour orangie turned off
the Rangers a few different ones and
this is a brand new one that has more
amber notes in it so the main thing you
can smell with it is amber which is why
I still love it it's kind of a very rich
sweet and the honey foul smell it's
absolutely beautiful honestly you need
to try this if you ever walking through
Selfridges our House of Fraser or
somewhere that does show you our money
standards a perfume have a look at the
leper farm is so beautiful I can't tell
you how much I love this I've got two
candles favorite I bought these in
Boston I cannot wait to light them I've
had them before this is my favorite Naga
candle scent the Christmas cookie oh
it's just so wonderful it's just like
literally as if you just bathed cupcakes
or shortbread I think it's just
wonderful I mean it's pulling up to
everyone's taste because it's so sweet
but I just really like sweet things but
this is gonna be on my desk
it's absolutely love it and I haven't
had this one for years I remember it was
an old favorite sugar and spice and it's
got a bit of a kind of donut meat
pumpkin meat sugar inna it's so
incredible I can't wait to have these
lit also with Yankee Candles they have a
few different sizes that you can get and
I have been assured that this size burn
slightly less than the other ones which
means it lasts twice as long and also
smell twice as strong so when I was
going to brown I was gonna buy the big
ones that honestly if you buy these they
last longer and they smell twice as
stronger than the larger one this is
like okay sold I'll get these so I might
have this in the bathroom or I may just
have it in the lounge because it's just
going to fill the room and the smell in
same another one to mention as you know
I have braces and it's all going really
well by the way I am in love with my
dentist he's so fantastic I just love
the way my teeth look now I still have
another six months to go as well so I
can't see how they look in the end by
the way my dentist is the London lingual
orthodontics clinic I'll leave a link
down below if you are looking to get
lingual braces and my braces from the
back of my teeth anyway I've been
meaning to get myself an electric
toothbrush for ages
and it turns out there are B have a
brand new one so I was right on this
it's there kind of 9000 genius one I
think and I use this this morning
actually but it looks likes it's just a
full black Rach now I don't use this to
its full potential because this is so
technical you can kind of link it with
your mobile phone so that you can kind
of keep an eye on how well you're
brushing and they're about ten different
brush heads depending on if what you
want it to do it's a lot going on with
this but honestly it's so really and
I've never felt like my teeth have been
cleaner then they have done after using
this so I know it's a bit of a random
favorite but I'm just really enjoy
brushing my teeth right now I think
that's actually it for beauty there's a
few things I wanna mention for fashion
just quite quick the first I think could
probably be this jumper this is from n
Peele and it's a gorgeous cashmere
sweater it's only much more kind of
higher-end price scale for knitwear
because it is cashmere and it is more of
a kind of upper high street luxury brand
but I just want to mention it for any of
you guys who will really love your
luxury knitwear which I'm sure there are
a lot of you and who also really love
cashmere but the overall knit of this
and how soft and silky and beautiful it
says I wanted to mention it because I
don't really like to take this off
anymore and whilst I could mention a lot
of the different boots that you'll have
seen in recent videos I can I want to
mix it up a little bit and show you
these boots
seriously how cool is because he's a
Topshop they are velvet they are
embellished they are almost the rock
print floral embellishment sequins fell
actually kind of 50 different trends
rolled into warm boot and I think that's
why I like them so much with the big
block heel as well they're really
comfortable to wear they have a bit more
of a square toe they're just very very
lovely and I wore these in a blog post
recently and so many people went crazy
for them but you're literally brand new
out as well someone just get them all on
the Block in pretty good time and I
think everyone was kind of like oh my
gosh I need these boots I'm so glad I
managed to get my hands on them before
they started running out yeah these are
a brilliant more affordable boot if
you're looking for something a bit more
kind of fancy and a bit more in the
floral velvet kind of field for
autumn/winter things
goto and just as one last piece of
fashion to kind of mention that I've
been really been enjoying is another
piece from Topshop and it's this sweater
you may have seen me in a recent video
again wearing this but it's a really
wonderful knit very chunky I think this
is kind of like a pill knit stitching
it's got a mixture of white and black
threading to give a very kind of marbled
effect all over it's got a lovely
turtleneck nothing too big aa structured
but just to kind of enough to give you
some shape and it's quite a nice long
length as well oh and I also really like
this kind of contrasting detailing to
the cost just a little bit more detail
but it's not very nice evening you
jumper think it's about forty pounds
from Topshop so the sky thing could wear
off through winter and autumn and get
those wear out better no I certainly
have so far so yeah
Topshop at the moment it's really
killing actually in fact I'll leave the
link down below for the blog post I did
where I featured like four or five
different Topshop pieces in a blog post
outfit and I really love that outfit I
think a lot of you guys would probably
really love the pieces in there as well
so good have a peek at that anyway I'm
gonna leave it there because this is
probably longest video I've done in a
while but I really hope you enjoyed it
and seeing some new products and some
products I'm really loving and a few
bits of fashion but I really enjoy doing
this video so please do let me know if
you are still enjoying them give this
video a like if you did really enjoy it
that always helps me out so I know to
film some more and if you have run new
here I would love it if you came back

will put up on the screen now I think
it'll be around here just click that and
