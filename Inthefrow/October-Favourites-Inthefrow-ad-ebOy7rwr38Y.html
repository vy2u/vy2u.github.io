means it's going to be a November
favorites haul I love doing these each
month it's a good way to kind of catch
up and reminisce about what I have loved
for previous months I always sort of
what I come to do my favorites videos I
always actually walk around my room for
about 15 minutes and let's go
what exactly was I really been loving
this month so I found a few things that
I'd odd and I got loads of use out of so
I thought I would show them all to you
so let's get to it I'm gonna Scout the
few beauty things first off so let's see
first thing we're gonna go with is this
lip balm by by Terry and it's the bomb
to rose new tricular in rose babe it's
just a lip balm at first I really want
like heat on this I don't know why it
just didn't really take me but then the
more I started using it the more I
realized just how much it sort of
plotted my lips and as this beautiful
rosy Sheen to them the kind of lips that
you always see in magazines where the
model is completely soft nude face for
beautiful face and then their lips are
really plump and nude and really look so
hydrating moisturize it looks like that
really when you have this your lips so
it just really launched at the lips it
makes them look really really hydrated
and moisturized and it just adds that
little subtle rosy Sheen to them as well
so I actually have completely full turn
and now love this product a lot okay
next thing I've been really liking so
far is the new collab dry shampoos by
Ruth create that model recommends and
she's brought out quite a few of these I
think there might about five different
styles to choose from this one is in New
York and I also have
however I've only really use this one so
far and it's really great I am NOT a
massive fan of dry shampoos I finally
really make my hair
ridiculously dry and unworkable and
unmanageable I just really want to have
something my hair and still have that
movement to it
what habit still soft so good a bit of
the sort of a few days we've had your
hair and washed and this I feel really
good that it works so much better than
40 so I've never been a big fan of
batiste at all this works so much better
so much better than anything else I've
ever really used so this is by far the
best dry shampoo I've got across so big
big props to this and highly recommend
it don't know where the lid is another
beauty product I've really been getting
back into I spotted this little day in
my lake up jar and realized I hadn't
worn it for ages and it's a themed Mac
mineralized blush and this is in Lord to
love and it's really lovely
peachy toned blush with a goal of so
normals nothing too shimmery it's not
like a big it's a literary Sheen at all
in fact it's hardly any anything like
that it's much more almost maps but with
a almost like a shoe so hard it's like
it's almost like a sheen so I was like a
luminescent sheen that allowed to the
cheeks rather than a glitter and that is
a shame absolute all right now Sasa
blurred to them and the last peach
product I mentioned is this by Hydra I
don't think I've mentioned this before
or if I haven't really really sorry and
I'm still loving it
however this is something I use every
single day for my makeups first thing I
apply onto my face before I then add
moisturizer it contains hyaluronic acid
which is kind of a buzzword at the
moment in skincare
but a lot of products now are containing
this as it really helps to boost
hydration and then Meister within the
skin because it holds a thousand times
its weight in water
so it really enables your face to stay a
lot more moisturized and hydrated
throughout the day so I love gotten this
under bikes drives if I feel like you
almost soaps at the moisturizer for me
makes my skin feel so much month long
and nowhere near as a door and yeah I
just grow a hugely fond of it this and
other serums but generally I have this
every single day
in fact no aforementioned fashion I
mentioned a few other things sort of
random things first one being my block
and really reel it back into my blog
again I kind of lost my mojo a little
bit with it at one point I felt like my
content often as fun and exciting and I
really feel like I've kind of got my
mojo back and I feel like I'm really
enjoying putting outfits together for
you and for anyone that likes to read my
blog and I'm jealous trying to put
outfits together before I head off to
work or ever quickly take some photos
and upload them to the phone more
realistic and you can really see what
I'm wearing so and then a lot of those
also got to Instagram so if you don't
follow me already go over to Instagram
and just at in the fro I'll have a look
for me and my blog it's just fro calm
and yeah we haven't really really
enjoyed it really liking it and I think
there might be some more blog sort of
website change its kind of thing too but
I'm super excited good thing I want to
talk about it something that I haven't
really ever heard anyone speak about
much really before on YouTube and it's
an audiobook service from audible all
over the live part Amazon so you may
have heard about it but it's so helpful
and useful especially for me with me
always being so busy I'm always on the
blogging or working alright in lectures
I'll do something else on the computer I
don't really get much time to read I
used to read so much like so much and
now I just don't have much time to read
I think I have one book called sad my
bed and I haven't touched it in months
because I just don't have the time to
pick it up yeah I heard about horrible
service and thought would be quite cool
ideas give it a go and I remember a
friend of mine a while back who wasn't
that good at reading he
it told me that he loved to get these
audible books because it meant that he
could kind of sit around and listen to
them I don't have to read because he
wasn't very good reader and I remember
it got me thinking about it I didn't
really realize such huge service sister
did these audiobooks and actually had
loads of people narrating their things
so I thought I'd give it a go and I had
a look and on there I found my favorite
author who was chuck Palani och I'm
massive action plan yuck I have read a
lot of his books you might know cheap
plan yaku from films Fight Club and
choke perhaps because he wrote those
amazing books and films really sought to
pitch what he was trying to say in the
books as well
amazing amazing author he's got a really
kind of gritty style to his work and
yeah there really was like a books and
I've not read tell-all by him so I
downloaded tell-all download it got my
chips and the cool thing about it as
well is that they actually have an app
as well so in the app you can buy books
you can listen to books so on library I
can go in there it's got my book so I
can listen to it then tells me how many
time I'm trying I've been listening to
it so it's really really cool
actually in the week know how long I've
been spending out there reading and
getting away from the computer which is
good for me so unless I tell you about
it cuz that's like it's a really cool
service and I'm really been enjoying it
as break away from the computer at some
points the other thing about it too is
that if you go along to audible decoder
UK forward slash in the fro you too can
get a free book you can't tell by should
plug you can get any other book that you
possibly like out with thousands of they
sell is so so many signatures any like
you just go sign up to the 30 day free
trial and get free book quickly move on
to fashion products have not got many so
I'm just gonna show you what I love the
most
first of all these jeans from River
Island which are like a boyfriend cut
almost quite a baggy kind of court and
the best bit is to cut out to the news
which of course are really really on
trend and I'm just loving them cuz it
gives a bit more of an edge to it also
not
they're quite short leg as well they're
not really really long so you can turn
them up you can wear them as little
ankle boots or flats or you can tuck
them into larger boots and it just yeah
it was really really cool vibe to them
really really love those and then
thought about from River Island camera
is really breaking and it keeps stepping
so if I look different we need to be
shots it's because I have to do it from
down okay right next favorite a lot of
beads boots these are from a sauce but
they're actually new look boots I saw
these on the beautiful lanlan Walker and
she looked amazing in them I don't think
these exact ones she have has bought the
very very similar and I just needed to
get myself a pair I'm in a massive thing
though where I'm just loving long
dresses like knit dresses that are just
about knee high and then these are just
over the knee so kind of like that look
where you get the kind of slit in
between the boots and you dress and this
gives a little bit of skin in between -
and these are perfect for max and the
perfect height just over the knee
they're a little bit soft wide around
back of the leg as well I'm really
exposed now actually so dark but yeah
but brilliant and the 35-pound is so
comfortable and go with sterling outfit
I am obsessed
then over jeans or with long dresses
like I said they are amazing by the way
all inks are Bellerophon awesome already
the third thing is this jacket this is
from boater skins and it's the black
leather quilted biker jacket it's
amazing it's really similar to the old
sense leather jackets that they do as
well my flat mate how's that one it's
beautiful and this is really really
similar it's an the most beautiful
leather it's gorgeous it's super soft
also really quite thick as well so it's
perfect for winter it gives you super
warm if I was really insulating and it
has got some really cool detail so it's
got the ribbon detail on a short pass
and to your coughs it's got this
quilting effect almost it
now back quilt across the very back of
the shoulders and you've got some
ribbing and quilting down the very sides
and it does sort of patterns up a bit
like a fight you really can't style and
it's awesome it goes to absolutely
everything and I've been wearing this so
so much it's perfect for winter like a
sexes for really really warm and that's
from the boater skins I've got another
jacket from them and it brown and I
absolutely love it as well so it's a
brand I've got my eye on definitely the
very man this is about 350 pounds and
know it's pricey but sometimes you go to
spell it with more leather jackets and
things like that and it'll last me for
ages and ages so I absolutely love this
this month unless but not least is this
bag this is from goggles and it's from
brand Rebecca Minkoff it's so so
sophisticated I'm sure and grownup
Bachelet love it it's in a textured
leather which is always better to get
textured let that if you can get back
because we get painted leather you're
obviously going to get a nick met off
scratch or something it's going to get
ruined so I look at it takes your
leather for that reason it's got gold
hardware so got beautiful gold strap
leather to the very top and then it says
Rebecca Minkoff on the back in the
little emblem and then it's got a little
opening here and it's so cute so vintage
retro style and then it's got enough
room in there that's a whole lotta make
up your purse and your keys and your
phone everything
if amazing I can't wait to wear this for
date night or an evening out who really
sophisticated evening out kind of where
it's moved to fall legs a little bit so
much so this is from cockles is 210
pounds and again I realize it's quite
pricey for but again kind of leather
beautiful brag bags that gonna cost a
little bit more I don't think tuned
intends too bad for this it's got quite
a good size to it beautiful leather and
it's just
so that's everything for my favorite
really really hope you enjoyed it if you
did please give me a thumbs up and also
subscribe if you're new that'll be
awesome hope you enjoyed it and I'll see
you really with suits that's all folks
