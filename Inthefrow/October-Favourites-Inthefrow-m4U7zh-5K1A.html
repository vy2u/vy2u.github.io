well it is time for another month of
favorites it is today Halloween that I'm
filming this so it wasn't that I loved
for the previous month october going to
show you go through everything that i
lived ok a usual suspect i mentioned on
the bytearray bond arose however i
usually go for Rosie Bay which is more
of a pink tone this is the original I
think this is just the plain and I think
it might love it more really love an
ambient moment I've got a bit of that on
with a bit of a nude lip of the top it
just enhances my lips and makes them
look incredible and it's my favorite bar
ever new favorite foundation I've been
meaning to pick up the Makeup Forever HD
ultra HD foundation for a long long time
like every time that I went to America I
would go to sephora and b line for this
counter and every time I pick it off in
my shade and think should I get it
should I get it and I'd always just
think no don't really need another
foundation anyway finally got my hands
on it pretty sure this is number 125 but
i'll leave it down below it doesn't say
anywhere on this bottle wat number this
is which is a little bit crazy I think
it's number 125 and it's put too much
just like NARS sheer glow deauville
which is why I probably love it because
I love now sheer glow doable I have it
on today in fact this entire makeup look
you will see in my next week in next
Sunday's for Jim do my for everyday
makeup routine so you'll see that then
this is a medium coverage you could
definitely build it up add a few more
layers and make it a bit heavier but
it's not too cakey it doesn't feel that
heavy on the skin it makes my skin look
really quite flawless infected it's just
a really great medium coverage medium
almost go up to a high coverage
foundation to new tanning products of
the hour zen town and back on this end
town if you watch my videos back the day
my blog you'll know that I was the
biggest advocate for suntan I wouldn't
use anything else and recently I've been
using this san Tropez and loving that
however Zen town just brought out this
clear
collection the idea being that when you
put it on it doesn't have the dark color
straight away which means that you can
kind of where your normal clothes if you
want to or not feel as though you're
rubbing off brown smudges on your door
frames and things like I often do you
can go to bed in it and feel like you're
not going to get dark clothes on the
sheets which is really good it also
doesn't smell quite as bad either it's
got a more fruity smell it's nowhere
near as bad to see olds in town that's
for sure this is kind of a couple of
days later I've had this on but it's
still looking pretty good and then this
is off of the face tan and I never
really use face times before well it
works brilliantly this is some medium
fresh-faced tab so I put these on
overnight woke up in the morning and
literally felt like a golden goddess so
I was very very impressed love does a
lot i haven't mentioned deodorant for a
long time but this is the right guard
total defense 5 sport i just feel more
safe and secure wearing this because
it's just so hard core and i adore the
smell like whenever i like seem to put
this on I'd be like you smell so good
and I started wearing it at like
sneaking a bit of his and then now I
just buy it myself it keeps me smelling
fresh and fine all day and I know if I
get that feeling of oh god it's my deal
didn't smell funny cuz I find sometimes
women's deodorants after a few hours you
can start to smell a bit odd then like
that whereas this is so good and it last
for ages but i would recommend a sport
one the orange one it's an Isis smelling
one new palette love is the new bare
minerals not too sure it's cold I think
it's called the blush and lou manizer
palette but it has three shades inside a
bronze a medium pink and a light pink
light pink is great if you want to do
more of a highlight shade medium pink
for blush and then obviously this the
bronzer but I have been mixing up these
two together and I have them on my
cheeks now actually I adore this palette
it's so gorgeous these are so
illuminating on the cheeks nearly
brighten their holes of your cheeks
stunning and this is a really lovely
brown shade as well so again I've got
that on today sort of lightly around my
temples or my cheeks it's beautiful so
this is a massive new favorite for me I
love that a lot the last piece of beauty
I've got is the stunning my burberry
christmas edition bottle I don't know
where this has been all of my life but
this smells absolutely beautiful it's
got it's almost like a little Christmas
globe and it's got the glitter gold
glitter inside it so it's this stirring
bottle really lovely top marble top the
smell is absolutely beautiful there's a
sweetness to it is almost a fruitiness
to it then there's also the underlying
floral it's girly but not too
in-your-face young girl II smell
something quite mature very feminine
about it it's a kind of thing I could
imagine a girl in her teens so on my age
mid-twenties and someone in their
thirties forties and I could imagine my
mom wearing this in her 50s as well I
had to mention it and then should have
you to this bottle whilst becomes in
love with that right now these bad boys
I should not have bought them these are
the devil on my way back recently from
New York I picked up a bag of these
smaller bag mind you for Alex in the
airport and we got through them pretty
damn fast and then neither day out of
cravings so i went on to amazon i found
this extra extra large bag which is a
50-ounce 22 pounds which is ridiculous
for chocolate but it because of peanut
book this is a peanut butter flavor not
the peanut peanut butter I don't know
this existed I'm a massive peanut butter
fan like ridiculous and these are the
tastiest eminem's you'll love dry your
life moving on to clothing I don't know
if I've mentioned these boots if I have
I'm quickly going to mention them again
because i'm just so smitten with them i
would go as far as saying that out of
the 31 days last month i wore these 28
without doubt cerise boots in the black
suede hi uncle top the brown wooden heel
with gold detailing and the incredible
pointed toe they are comfortable I walk
to our meetings in these I go out and
like I say 28 days of the month I will
be wearing these shoes they just look
fantastic with everything jeans leggings
jeans leather trousers mini dresses maxi
dresses midi dresses yeah so i'll leave
the link down below if you're looking
for something like this said highly
recommend you would not believe how many
compliments i've had on these boots when
I've been at meetings pretty much
everyone that I've been to a meeting
with has said where are your boots from
I'm gonna go get some no joke everyone
will love these boots so big big hit
next up is actually some sleep wear that
i have got from Victoria's Secret and
it's a nightdress it's a cotton jersey
night dress just long enough to keep you
dignified nice long sleeves but in the
softest cotton it's so beautiful it just
looks so cute on just got a little bit
for lower v-neck so something a little
quite a little bit sexy about it this
little pocket that's got the vs on it
but then for when it gets colder in the
next few months so into more into
December and then going to move into the
next victoria secret thing which are
these pajamas they are literally like
the famous victoria secret pink striped
pajamas long sleeved a little pocket
again with a vs on it and you come with
the matching pink stripe bottoms they're
silky comfortable a drawstring way sucka
men out of it small exceeds our small I
could've done with an extra small but
they didn't have an extra small because
these apparently are the best selling
thing in victoria secret whenever they
come in they go back out again so it's
kind of thing we've got to get your
hands on them whenever you see them so I
got these
I'm so smitten with them they're
absolutely beautiful and last but not
least is my favorite knit you know that
I that knits and last time it had
favored 'it's i mention my other
favorite in it this is my new favorite
net it's from a run called the fifth
which is an australian brand large trunk
in it it's not completely contained so
you can kind of see a little bit
underneath eyes were bra it's fine can't
we see anything but i love this large
chunky turtle neck collar that it's got
it's just so warm and beautiful and the
kind of very ivory white cream is so
flattering as well quite a long length
so i've been wearing it with jeans and
I've also been tucking it into the jeans
a very front letting the back hang out
and that looks quite cute as well so
yeah yeah and that's it for this month I
