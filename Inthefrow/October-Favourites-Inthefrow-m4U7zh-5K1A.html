well it is time for another month of
favorites it is today Halloween I'm
filming this so everything that I loved
for the previous month of October I'm
gonna show you go through everything
that I learned okay a usual suspect I
mention a lot on the by Terry Baume De
Rose however I usually go for OFI Bay
which is more of a pink tone this is the
original I think this is just the plain
and I think it might love it more really
a love an ambient moment I've got a bit
of that on with a bit of a nude lip over
the top it just enhances my lips and
makes them look incredible and it's my
favorite bar ever new favorite
foundation I've been meaning to pick up
the Makeup Forever HD Ultra HD
foundation for a long long time like
every time that I went to America I
would go to Sephora and beeline for this
counter and every time I pick it off in
my shade and think should I get he
should I get it and I'd always just
think no I don't really need through the
foundation anyway finally got my hands
on it pretty sure this is number one to
five but I'll leave it down below it
doesn't say anywhere on this bottle what
number this is which is a little bit
crazy I think it's number one to five
and it's pretty much just like NARS
sheer glow Deauville which is why I
probably love it because I love now
sheer glow doable I have it on today in
fact this entire makeup look you will
see in my next week in next Sunday's for
gym I'm doing my for everyday makeup
routine so you'll see that then this is
a medium coverage you could definitely
build it up add a few more layers and
make it a bit heavier but it's not too
cakey it doesn't feel that heavy on the
skin it makes my skin look really quite
flawless and affected it's just a really
great medium coverage medium almost go
up to a high coverage foundation to new
tanning products of the hour
zen tan and back on the sun tan if you
watch my videos back the day my blog
you'll know that i was the biggest
advocate for suntan i wouldn't use
anything else and recently I've been
using this San Tropez and loving that
however
Zen town just brought out this clean
collection the idea being that when you
put it on it
doesn't have the dark color straightaway
which means that you can kind of wear
your normal clothes if you want to or
not feel as though you're rubbing off
brown smudges on your door frames and
things like I often do you can go to bed
in it and feel like you're not going to
get dark clothes on the sheets which is
really good
it also doesn't smell quite as bad
either it's got a more fruity smell it's
nowhere near as bad to see olds in town
that's for sure this is kind of a couple
of days later I've had this on but it's
it's still looking pretty good and then
this is after the face tan and I never
really use face science before well this
works brilliantly this is some medium
fresh face time so I put these on
overnight woke up in the morning and
literally felt like a golden goddess so
I was very very impressed I love those a
lot I haven't mentioned deodorant for a
long time this is the right guard total
defense 5 sport I just feel more safe
and secure wearing this because it's
just so hardcore and I adore the smell
like whenever I like seems to put this
on I'd be like you smell so good
and I started wearing it at like
sneaking a bit of hiss and then now I
just buy it myself
it keeps me smelling fresh and fine all
day and I know if I get that feeling of
oh god it's my do didn't smell funny cuz
I find sometimes women's deodorants
after a few hours you can start to smell
a bit hot didn't like that whereas this
is so good and it lasts for ages but I
would have come in the spot one the
orange one it's a nicest smelling one
new palette love is the new bareMinerals
I'm not too sure it's called I think
it's called the blush and Luminizer
palette but it has three shades inside a
bronze a medium pink and a light pink
light pink is great if you want to do
more of a highlight shade medium pink
the blush and then obviously this
bronzer but I have been mixing up these
two together and I have them on my
cheeks now actually I adore this palette
it's so gorgeous these are so
illuminating on the cheeks nearly
brightened their horse of you cheeks
stunning and this is a really lovely
bronze shade as well so again I've got
that on
des sort of lightly around my temples on
my cheeks it's beautiful so this is a
massive new favorite for me I love that
a lot the last piece of beauty I've got
is the stunning my Burberry Christmas
edition bottle I don't know where this
has been all of my life but this smells
absolutely beautiful it's got it's
almost like a little Christmas globe and
it's got the glitter gold glitter inside
it so it's this stunning bottle really
lovely top marble top
the smell is absolutely beautiful
there's a sweetness to it this almost of
fruitiness to it then there's also the
underlying floral it's girly but not too
in-your-face young girly smell there's
something quite mature very feminine
about it it's the kind of thing I could
imagine a girl in her teens on my age
mid-twenties and someone in their
thirties forties and I could imagine my
mom wearing this in her 50s as well I
had to mention it and then should have
you to this bottle whilst becomes in
love with that right now these bad boys
I should not have bought them these are
the devil on my way back recently from
New York I picked up a bag of these
smaller bag mind you for Alex in the
airport and we got through them pretty
damn fast and then neither day after
craving so I went onto Amazon I found
this extra extra-large bag which is a
50-ounce
22 pounds which is ridiculous for
chocolate but it's because of peanuts
bought this is a peanut butter flavor
not the peanut peanut butter I didn't
know this existed I'm a massive peanut
butter fan like ridiculous
and these are the tastiest M&amp;amp;Ms you'll
love drying at life
moving on to clothing I don't know if
I've mentioned these loops if I have I'm
quickly going to mention them again
because I'm just so smitten with them I
would go as far as saying that out of
the 31 days last month I wore these 28
Thursday
without doubt cerise boots in the black
suede hi and cult top the brown wooden
heel with gold detailing and the
incredible pointed toe they are
comfortable I walk to our meetings in
these I go out like I say 28 days of the
month I will be wearing these shoes they
just look fantastic with everything
jeans leggings jeans leather trousers
mini dresses maxi dresses mini dresses
yeah so I'll leave a link down below if
you're looking for something like they
said highly recommend you would not
believe how many compliments I've had on
these boots when I've been at meetings
pretty much everyone that I've been to a
meeting with has said where are your
boots from I'm gonna go get some no joke
everyone will love these boots so big
big hit next up is actually some
sleepwear that I have got from
Victoria's Secret and it's a night dress
it's a cotton Jersey night dress just
long enough to keep you dignified Nifong
sleeves this in the softest cotton it's
so beautiful but it just looks so cute
on just got a little bit of a lower
v-neck so something a little quite a
little bit sexy about it this little
pocket that's got the V S on it but then
for when it gets colder in the next few
months so into more into December and
then gonna move into the next Victoria's
Secret thing which these pajamas
they are literally like the famous
Victoria Secret pink striped pajamas
long sleeved a little pocket again with
a V S on it and we come with the
matching pink stripe bottoms they're
silky comfortable a drawstring waist a
coming up a bit small exceeds our small
I could pull it up done with an extra
small but they didn't have an extra
small because these apparently are the
best-selling thing in Victoria's Secret
whenever they come in they go back out
again so it's kind of thing we've got to
get your hands on them whenever you see
them so I got the
and I'm so smitten with them they're
absolutely beautiful and last but not
least is my favorite knit you know that
I that knits and last time it had
favorites I mentioned my other favorite
in it this is my new favorite net it's
from a brand called v which is an
Australian brand large chunky knit it's
not completely contained so you can kind
of see a little bit underneath I swear
with bra it's fine
can't miss anything but I love this
large chunky turtle neck collar that
it's got it's just so warm and beautiful
and the kind of very ivory white cream
is so flattering as well it's quite a
long length so I've been wearing it with
jeans and I've also been tucking it into
the jeans a very front I let in the back
hang out and that looks quite cute as
well and that's it for this month I hope
