you waiting long enough this is going to
be my October love list if your knees
around here then you might not know what
Lovelace is it is pretty much my
favorite personal things so nothing to
do with favorites and month white beauty
and fashion instead it's about favorite
things that I've done or seen or watched
or all that good stuff it's a little bit
more personal one to one getting to know
each other you know that gun bangs gonna
dive straight in what was my favorite
thing that I watched this month's I'm
probably going to say actually the
Martian me night went a little date we
had hot dogs we had drinks we had when
those like tango blast things that might
rot your teeth but we went and watched
the Martian and I will say I really
really enjoyed it I thought Matt Damon
was amazing in it and I love Jessica
Chastain she's probably my favorite
actress and she was in it I would highly
recommend you can see that was really
really good watch oh also the favorite
thing I watched one tree hill I managed
to download the it's called jolla jolla
app you download it stick it in a
bookmark bar and then you're able to
turn your browser into either English or
American browser so I turn it to
American go on to netflix and it allows
me to see all the American Netflix which
means I can stream one tree hill from
Netflix which is making my life I
literally have not turned it off since I
realize this see favorite photo off snap
of the month I always like looking back
to my Instagram seeing light which was
my most favorite photo that I definitely
took this month and I'd probably say it
was this one I'll put it up here it was
in the Maldives and we were flying over
the Maldives in a seaplane so you're
only about a thousand feet up so the
views are insane as barely any cloud
cover so it's just clear blue skies blue
aqua water and all you could see with a
different maldivian islands around and
it was just mind-blowing if you haven't
seen my maldis vlog you should go watch
that I'll leave a link down below you
see actual footage in that vlog of me in
the plane shooting
down towards all the islands and so
beautiful it just brings back good
memories hoot i love this month i would
say my favorite people of the month not
just a person but people loosing Lydia I
have been meaning to mention them they
are pretty much my favorite every single
month but those two girls are just it's
some of the most loving and can people
have ever ever met I think they're just
so happy and they come from such a
heartfelt and genuine place they're
super form the super happy they're
really bubbly like me or get on so well
because we're so we're all very positive
and and very excitable and very happy so
when people around us it's to sort of
like screeching and squealing cuz we
just get all so well and yeah I've got a
lot of time and a lot of love for those
two girls so i'll leave the link down
below you should definitely go for them
if you don't already they are just
happiness and body really favorite piece
of clothing this month one of my most
favorites I've mentioned in my favorites
video it's a white turtleneck from the
fifth otherwise it would be this which I
found in iaeger I actually went shopping
actually physically shopped in a shop
and found this and it was in iaeger and
it was 50 pound off and it's a cashmere
turtleneck at best just not I'm sure
it's just a bit of a it's a nice little
top this cute little vest shape with the
turtleneck so I really liked this so I
say this definitely a favorite my
favorite way that I spent my free time
this month would probably be the
youtuber the gleam Halloween party such
a good evening it was it just didn't go
on long enough though like it finished
12 I started at eight we only got there
about quarter to nine and so it's like
three hours and then at twelve o'clock
we never had to be kicked out everyone's
like we want to carry on dancing but the
actual part it was so much fun I'm sure
that you saw lots of pictures on my
Instagram and lots of different things
that when answer is really really good
favorite food this month for this one I
would say when I was in the Maldives one
of the nights we had an African meal
and one of the dishes we had well when I
picked was ostrich never eaten ostrich
before very much hope this isn't round
upon but it's obviously eaten in Africa
and ours I was tasting some of the
African cuisine so I went with it so
don't judge me on this people anyway I
had this ostrich a little tiny part with
the crust of like cheese on the top and
it's almost at minced it's absolutely
delicious certainly a food experience
let's say that my favorite drink this
month i would say would be I've stumbled
upon Monmouth coffee and apparently
Monmouth coffees meant to be the best
coffee in London so it's a little tiny
coffee shop on your way into comic
garden common coffee and I had one there
and I had it an iced latte so it was ice
it was a bit it was like one shot of
coffee I'm not a massive coffee drinker
one shot of coffee topped up of milk and
I also put some sugar syrup in there as
well and any other day when I was in the
Thomases cafe which is part of Burberry
beautiful cafe by the way highly
recommend it it's incredible they serve
Monmouth coffee as well so I had a mom
of coffee latte and that time I had a
galve syrup in it and it's just so good
if you like lattes and you love iced
lattes and you would all of that my
favorite event or occasion this month
it's got to be the Maldives it has to be
I mean I also went to New York and had
the best time again I did a vlog on that
it was incredible I mean I Love New York
but the Maldives is a beach holiday and
it's just paradise I don't think
anything could ever beat paradise so for
me that is a holiday i will probably
never ever forget it was just absolutely
incredible it was a big eye-opener
favorite song this month has to be
justin bieber sorry and i'm not sorry
it's justin bieber and i've mentioned
before i think one of my last favorites
whilst justin bieber what do you mean
which isn't absolute tune this one is is
i'd say it's not as good as what do you
mean but it's still extremely catchy
I've been turn it over and over and over
what you
there are two others that i would also
highly recommend and I've been flicking
between the three and just having the
three and repeat constantly so Justin
Bieber sorry zero by chris brown also
running by beyonce &amp;amp; D Jake I'm the name
of him and last question is the favorite
thing that I use a favorite thing but I
use I just SAT here for a while think
about this and I would say it's quite a
loose one but i would say the services
at dry by getting my nails done i
absolutely love that salon i love the
ladies at work there i got my nails done
there took about two hours for full
shellac I got my show is done as well
