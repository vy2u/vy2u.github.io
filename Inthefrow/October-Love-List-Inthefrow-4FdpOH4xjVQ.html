you waiting long enough this is going to
be my October love list if you're new
around here then you might not know what
loveless is it is pretty much my
favorite personal things so nothing to
do with favorites of the month like
beauty and fashion instead it's about
favorite things that I've done or seen
or watched or all that good stuff it's a
little bit more personal one-to-one
getting to know each other you know that
kind of thing gonna dive straight in
what was my favorite thing that I
watched this month I'm probably gonna
say actually the Martian me nights when
it's a little date we had hot dogs we
had drinks we had when those like tango
blast things that might rot your teeth
but we went and watched the Martian and
I must say I really really enjoyed it I
thought Matt Damon was amazing in it and
I love Jessica Chastain she's probably
my favorite actress and she was in it I
would highly recommend you're gonna see
that was really with a good watch oh
also it's a favorite thing I watched one
tree hill I managed to download the it's
called hula-hula app you download it
stick it in your bookmark bar and then
you're able to turn your browser into
either English or American browser so I
turn it to American go on to Netflix and
it allows me to see all the American
Netflix which means I can stream on Tree
Hill from Netflix which is making my
life I literally have not turned it off
since I realized this see favorite photo
off snap of the month I always like
looking back to my Instagram and seeing
like which was my most favorite photo
that I definitely took this month and
I'd probably say it was this one I'll
put it up here it was in the Maldives
and we were flying over the Maldives in
a seaplane so you're only about a
thousand feet up so the views are insane
as barely any cloud cover so it's just
clear blue skies blue aqua water and all
you could see with a different
Maldivian Islands
around and it was just mind-blowing if
you haven't seen my maldis vlog you
should go watch that I'll leave a link
down below you see actual footage in
that vlog of me in the plane shooting
down towards all the islands and so
beautiful it just brings back good
memories who tell of this month I would
say my favorite people of the month not
just person but people loosing Lydia I
have been meaning to mention them they
are pretty much my favorite every single
month
but those two girls are just it's some
of the most loving and can people have
ever ever met I think they're just so
happy and they come from such a
heartfelt and genuine place less to
perform they're super happy they're
really bubbly like we all get on so well
because we're so we're all very positive
and and very excitable and very happy so
when people around us it's just a lot of
like screeching and squealing we just
get all so well and yeah I've got a lot
of time and a lot of love for those two
girls so I'll leave their link down
below
you should definitely go and follow them
if you don't already they are just
happiness and body really favorite piece
of clothing this month one of my most
favorites I've mentioned in my favorites
video
it's a white turtleneck from the fifth
otherwise it would be this which I found
in iaeger I actually went shopping
actually physically shopped in a shop
and found this and it was in iaeger and
it was 50 pound off and it's a cashmere
turtleneck vest I'm sure is a bit of a
it's a nice little top with cute little
vest shape with the turtleneck so I
really liked this so I say it's
definitely a favorite my favorite way
that I spent my free time this month
would probably be the YouTuber the gleam
Halloween party such a good evening it
was it just didn't go on long enough
though like it finished at 12 I started
at 8 we only got there about quarter to
nine so it's like three hours and then
at 12 o'clock we'll never have to be
kicked out everyone's like we want to
carry on dancing but the actual party it
was so much fun
I'm sure that you saw lots of pictures
on my Instagram and lots of different
things that went on so is really really
good favorite food this month but this
one I would say when I was in the
Maldives one of the nights we had an
African meal and one of the dishes we
had well one I picked was ostrich never
eaten ostrich before very much I hope
this isn't around a pond but it's
obviously eaten in Africa and ours I was
tasting some of the African cuisine so I
went with it so don't judge me on this
people but anyway I had this ostrich
there little tiny part with the crust of
like cheese on the top and it's almost
like minced it's absolutely delicious
certainly a food experience let's say
that my favorite drink this month I
would say would be I've stumbled upon
Monmouth coffee and apparently Monmouth
coffees meant to be the best coffee in
London so it's a little tiny coffee shop
on your way into comic Garden common
coffee and I had one there and I had a
little an iced latte so it was iced it
was a bit it was like one shot of coffee
it's not a massive coffee drinker one
shot of coffee topped up with milk and I
also put some sugar syrup in there as
well and then the other day when I was
in the Thomas's cafe which is part of
Burberry beautiful cafe by the way
highly recommend it it's incredible they
serve Monmouth coffee as well so I had a
month of coffee latte and that time I
had agave syrup in it and it's so good
if you like lattes and you love iced
lattes and you would all love that
my favourite event or occasion this
month it's got to be the Maldives it has
to be I mean I also went to New York and
had the best time again I did a vlog on
that it was incredible I mean I love New
York but the Maldives is a beach holiday
it's just paradise
I don't think anything could ever beat
paradise so for me that is a holiday I
will and probably never ever forget it
was just absolutely incredible it was a
big eye-opener
favorite song this month has to be
Justin Bieber sorry
and I'm not sorry it's Justin Bieber and
I've mentioned before I think one of my
last favorites
just to be but what do you mean which is
an absolute tune this one is is I'd say
it's not as good as what do you mean but
it's still extremely catchy abandon it
over and over and over but yet there are
two others that I would also highly
recommend and I've been flicking between
the three and just having the three and
repeat constantly so Justin Bieber sorry
zero by Chris Brown also running by
Beyonce and D Jake I'm the name of him
and last question is the favorite thing
that I use favourite things that I use
I'm just I'm here for a while thinking
about this and I would say it's quite a
loose one but I would say the services
pat dry by getting my nails done I
absolutely love that salon I love the
ladies that work there I got my nails
done there took about two hours for full
shellac I got my stones done as well and
she walk I love having my toes
shellacked
it just means it doctor touch your toes
from the like three weeks you have to
touch them up with any nail polish so
one of my favorite things was definitely
going to drive by and get my nails done
professionally she did like this cool
geometric print on each one so they're
all slightly different I'm just totally
loving it and that is everything on the
love list I really hope you enjoying it
again make sure that you leave me some
comments down below and let me know what
was on your love list anything so what
was your favorite program this month
what was your favorite thing to eat and
drink this month let me know down below
I love reading comments I always read
them and try and comment back to as many
as I possibly can within the first hour
or so of the video going live so yeah I
really hope you enjoyed this guys I will
see you in my next one and take care
until then bye
