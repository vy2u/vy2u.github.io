you what I'm packing you my bag to give
anyone that's going on track America
with an idea of what to kind of take
with you because I've said it last

you a bit of inspiration as well and I
can show you my brand-new suitcase which

so you get a really good idea exactly I

know apart from all flip it's underwear
that I like to put in what why that's it
you also mention today I went and got
quite a few treatments done for politics
eyes from pet so I got a shellac done
perfect I'm so keep doing my nails for
three weeks you might notice my eyebrows
really dark I've just have them tinted
and out of my eyelashes tinted so I will
need to keep putting scar on
all the time especially when we're not
going to do anything air in mind that I
am meant to be taking a sleeping bag or
what I'm going to do is when I get there
I'm going to ask the drive sticks to a
Walmart I'm going to buy sleeping bag
and I'm gonna buy a pillow because super
cheap and Walmart's that when I fill it
into my case and lose room the very last
thing I want to show you is this it's my
brand new easy app how about I got this
from Amazon on these links below but
this is a joule power bank it is for
awesome portable recharging this is
going to be perfect because I can charge
my camera my phone my iPad whatever I
need to charge I can charge off this
because it's I know is a little bit
bigger than your average can portable
charger but that's because this will
charge your phone maybe seven times six
seven times rather than just once like a
small one does but I highly recommend
