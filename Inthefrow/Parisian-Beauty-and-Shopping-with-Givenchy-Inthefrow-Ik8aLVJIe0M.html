I'm really really special so I have this
I have a Chloe bag and I have some
shampoo to Rossi's to wear with it
Oh showered how cute is this bathrobe
there's all the best things about hotels
you just kind of wrap up in their
bathrobes and not mind about getting
makeup all of them like I do stay off my
eye makeup and I can put this down again
by 45 minutes you get a full face on
luckily my hair's John well hopefully I
want to take you out I'll be fine and

much ready put this on like Oh spritz my
face John oh that's pretty much hey
Smith in the case it's bread I can tell
my skin just doesn't feel never take off
on a core their attempt to do it again
straight after my eyes water my skin
doesn't let the makeup set into my face
properly so I've not even put in the
eyeliner offices no points it'll be half
a dollar face by the end of the night
back together it's taking my slowly drew
yeah so this is the dress which is
really beautiful and like I said this is
like a bridesmaid it's like a bridesmaid
dress it's got the pockets it's like a
bridesmaid type dress but I really just
thought it'd be very very pretty
although it's a little time at big I
wish it's a little bit more cinched in
this is a size six
so maybe just a bit
larger and persuade my jumpy to Rossi's
these are my most worn heels ever as you
probably know on their way into

siobhan she vonti
go back to London with the guy
so tired excited to get home my superior
driving ultimate eye seems to chill out
a bit where my orion why not available I
think goodbye so it's the next day and
they realized they hadn't even locked
in this goodie bag so I thought I would
thank you this little pad first up
little sample of the livers of other
Twilight which I actually love it's so
beautiful had a persona so nice they
also gave us a sample of the gentleman
only shibashi prison-break because he
showed us the advert for this let's see
so obviously this will be for Alex
gentlemen only it's very fresh and very
sort of been quite oceanic about it
bright so that before Alex
in fact might keep it for him as like a
little Valentine's gift it's not telling
that yeah I've got it
haha is a cushion kiss oh this looks so
nice go down a little cushion ball loss
it's really nice this is the healthy
little powder this is in number two oh
wow
those so gorgeous
I'm so glad they gave us the shade I
think that's going to look really
beautiful just kind of like a
highlighting bronzer so kind of when I
finished eye makeup kind of put my brush
into this will it around all of the face
and look really brightening glowy and
bronzed so the idea with this is that
these little bubbles pop and kind of
give out more of the color and you can
build it up and get a really pretty
healthy glow blush that it's a powdery
so obviously gives you more of a skin
texture oh what a lovely put it back
it's a bit of a crazy woman cuz I've got
no makeup on but it's all good I'm just
want to get ready to go out again which
will be in the next vlog so I really
hope you enjoyed come along to Paris
with me I don't really get to vlog my
last Paris trip but I did do a video so
the video will be out really really soon

almost until the end of the weekend they
also thought flock as well because I'm
seeing my best friend I'm seeing some
more of the girls as well tonight's that
