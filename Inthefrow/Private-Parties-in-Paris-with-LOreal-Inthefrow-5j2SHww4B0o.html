lore'l so L'Oreal brought me and kosher
kosher beauty along to Paris for a few
days to go to some Paris Fashion Week
shows to meet some of their very very
famous models spokesmodels go to some
amazing dinners and just have an amazing
sort of L'Oreal time that's why I'm here
so I thought I'd quickly show you around
as we used to do my vlogs this is the
hotel I'm going to do all her makeup on
hex is beautiful and then through here
I've got two beds this is really sweet
maybe some sort of cake which seems
lovely
um TV and then L'Oreal haven't left me a
beautiful box with the brand new nude
magique cushion foundation which so many
people go and crazy over at the moment
this is getting like so watch amazing
press I'm really excited about this it's
got the nude Rose palette that's
absolutely gorgeous faultless trusty L
net color riche la palette and nude oh
my goodness why is this not seen this oh
my gosh that is amazing so this is a lip
palette that looks incredible and that
is a jumper as well how gorgeous is this

shower and get my hair done I'm going to
put a new face makeup on for tonight we
are going to a spokesmodels dinner with
L'Oreal Sam eating quite lovely
L'Oreal models like Karlie Kloss most
beautiful women ever really so I'm
actually a little bit nervous like I'm
never usually nervous to meet new people
but there's people I really really
admire and look up to so it's kind
always exciting when that happens I
forgot to mention that we also have town
to watch two shows we went to the
Masonic rabbi show
we also went to John Galliano show
Louis Poppleton
yeah partly put it
you
I've just had my hair waved which is so
pretty
I had it L'Oreal Silas come round and do
this for me just really kind of simple
waves easy ways and now I'm going to
take off his makeup and quickly start
together with everything because it's
just a bit of a mess
to get myself ready and I'm trying out
this I mean I know I love where is it
the infallible 24 hours and I was going
to wear this but then L'Oreal had give
me this to try infallible sculpt and
this shade is amazing on my skin right
now what shade is this this is medium
medium dark by dumb bit ton at the
moment also this brush the morphe m43 9
which I got you the day because it
looked like it'd be amazing Foundation
and now realizes Jaclyn Hills claret
brush which I completely get now it's
absolutely incredible
it's like buffing air into your skin
it's so gorgeous I just put on a light
as coat of that foundation and my skin
looks like really flawless now I think
I'm finally ready it's taking me ages
and I just don't feel like right on my
skin to feel like it's taken and makeup
properly recently I had a bit of an a
kind of wardrobe nightmare so I've gone
with this dress again that I wore to a
Laurel event a few weeks ago the site
was really really pretty so I'm wearing
this and I'm wearing it with my Jovita
russy's the nude beige and black I'm
already late summer hair down

place where contango lighting in this
hotel room just got myself ready and
were on our way out now to breakfast a
matchless arming it's a bit later which
is quite a nice evening the court +10
had such a good sleep last night out of
sight out for a count so I no one needed
that sleep and I feel a lot better today

job to serve a leash oh and I think I'm
going to go for a really nice kind of
cafe lunch hopefully maybe Angelina a
large array and then maybe a little bit
shopping as well just we'll talk through
of whatever is on my face absolutely in
love with this is cm good if I show you
the label the L'Oreal infallible sculpt
I think I mentioned this yesterday
loving that so I've kind of used a
lighter shade everywhere they're darker
shade on top of the contour Ares it's
amazing thought I'd give the nude
palette ago so I've used this third
shade here this shade on the lid and
this on the inner corner this is three
and it's really quite pretty and natural
so I like that and then my favorite
mascara at the moment is going in this
one false lash sculpt then what's on my
lips I have some Xuan the Rose
Newton shade on my lips right now I
think I'll show you my outfit of the day

excited and I'm not really good I think
really appropriate to wear so I'm just

scenes of I'm guessing new adverts that
