getting ready for wedding or prom season
with a full makeup and hair routine and
different styling options from the
occasion where section at a sass so I
hope you enjoy and please keep watching
I have this gorgeous little makeup bag
is from Ted Baker so I filled this with
all the products I want to use today too
so don't forget anything going to start
off with this and this is brand-new from
ACS they'll order nutrious rosy prism
serum it's a radiance serum this smells
absolutely incredible it's very perfumed
if you don't want perfume things you
might not like this book and following
that I'm going to use a soap glory daily
youth 6 in 1 moisture lotion as you know
I like you to serum and a moisturizer
not everyone is bothered about wearing
two layers as I am from conversations
I've had but I really like to wear two
you feel super hydrated with it being
for a wedding it's going to be an
all-day thing and I wanted to last so
I'm going to use Laura Mercier
foundation primer radiance just have so
much radiance into the skin it's quite
brightening but it also every time I
wear this my makeup seems to last a
really long time I'm going to use a
little bit of this the ploy isn't I need
to prime twice but again I'm kind of
going for that absolutely ultra perfect
look and this is the nav Pro Prime
instant line and pore Perfector remember
everything that I'm using now you can
find below and the majority will be from
a sauce as well which is super handy I
love ordered for my sauce it's just so
easy so I'm just going to put this on
any kind of areas that I feel create
lines this literally looks like it's
filling in all of the lines on my face
okay pretty impressed with this why
should also probably mention that
today's look is going to be quite pretty
not like nothing too heavy very much
about the sort of illuminated bright
skin and quite flush very pink cheeks
that kind of thing so I'm ready to wash
all my brushes so I'm sorry if all the
brushes in this a little bit dirty I
really to wash my brushes I'll be doing
that later I promise
so this is the zoeva powder brush powder
polish brush it's just a living a large
brush for the first time ever I'm going
to try out the new NARS all day luminous
weightless foundation I've been dying to
try this because as you know sheer glow
is just my absolute favorite I've got it
in the same color as like the sheer glow
so I've got Joe villainous again so
let's give this a go something that's so
watery I'm actually quite impressed by
the coverage I switched off about under
my eyes at the moment I'm just so tired
I've been going to bark or even if you
have heard of it if you live in England
you might have heard of it it's a new
exercise type class and it combines like
ballet
yoga Pilates all of the kind of major
cool like workout regimes into this one
really difficult workout so I'm doing
that like four or five times a week
so I'm body is feeling it not so tired
I'm just adding a little bit more onto
the apples of my cheeks okay so I can
see that I'm going to use now screen you
can see everything and then I'm going to
use the Mac prep and prime
and just lineup always very here sprayed
my sponge with ammonia face mist as I
say every time you don't need to do this
you can just go and run your sponge into
water but as I'm sat right from the
camera it's not so easy and just dabbing
this and working it into the skin
this is finishing touch I'm just going
to use the bio Brown corrector in a
light peach and just dabbing my sponge
into that and then tapping it over the
top I almost find it helps to bring a
little bit more warmth back in you can
see though if you find it's got a little
fishy so I'm going to use the NARS loose
setting powder this is in the shade know
I've lost the brush that usually always
used so I'm just going to use the zoeva
luxe face focus brush dabbing that
through then get a little bit of that
okay next up I wanna do a little bit of
contouring just so everything looks
really defined and incredible so I'm
going to use a new nails multiple in
Vientiane mattes multiple so for this
pretty scary-looking I'm gonna see if
this works me we've got it - I need to
contour around size my face and my chin
line and also down so nurse once can
take this to your brush do automat well
v' and use this to start to blend this
out
also it takes a bit of time and
precision to do it's not something you
do quickly it's just with this it's just
all about picking up product and moving
it and blending it around the face
exactly where you want it to be
and then finally it's going to go back
to my original foundation brush but
you'll just help to blend everything
entirely then okay so all contoured I'm
just going to build into that even more
now I'm going to use the Illamasqua
sculpting powder duo brand new one my
usual matte sculpting brush large
contour brush rather and it's going to
go into the tanned product and work into
that contour that was created
I want to hire learner and this one is
really really pretty
it's so pigmented I could add this onto
the cheekbones and just to finish off
that face makeup I'm going to use a bit
of bronzer and I'm going to use this
absolutely beautiful new Tom Ford this
isn't gold dust look at this so have you
seen a bronzer more beautiful than this
I'm just going to use this to even out
my neck
little bit of my forehead little bit
down no not over that contour I was fine
at this bronzing stage is just a bit
where you bring going every color blends
together so your contour is mixed into
bronzer checks isn't to highlight and
then your foundation it just makes the
skin look a little bit more part of each
other rather than like five separate
areas well I think this is the first
benefit product to ever bought and for
me it's just so pretty and it's the
lightest pretty pink and so dainty it's
not cute and love that shade it's so
pretty
I'm just going to prep the lips with
thee by Terry Baume De Rose
okay bring you in close so you can see
okay I'm going to start off with the
lorac - it's got quite a lot of the
light tones and peaches around this end
I'd really like to use so I'm just going
to use a small petite crease brush from
zoeva like this and I'm going to take
these two lighter shades snow and beige
right here on the end I'm going to go
right at the very inner corner with this
so I'm just opening up that inner corner
just run it from there to the very
inners okay so the few things I want to
use here I'm also going to use a battery
ombre black star and he's in shade
frozen quartz number six because I just
want to add a little bit of shimmer to
this so I'm just going to add this over
the lid there's something quite pinky
and pretty about this shade I thought
would make it really nice for this look
you can blend that with your finger you
can blend it with a brush but they're so
bendable it's amazing
I'm just pulling that up to the crease
really because we're going to go over
the crease them in anyway look how
pretty that is
that's so nice I'm going to take nectar
right here this orangey toned Brown
should go you to flick with these colors
I'm going to run that into the crease
and I'm going to take a little bit of
buff OOP off this cream shade a lot
better now
it's a little bit of both of those cause
buff this matte and snow is like
glittery and I just like to add that to
my brow bone this is why I don't do my
eyebrows first because I'd just be
ruining them now I always do this after
my eyebrows and this has helped to not
only illuminate this area with product
but you can then start to wing the brush
or lower onto that eyeshadow and just
start to blend that out
I'm also though going to go into the
waterline with this and this is the
L'Oreal silk kissimmee circa Samir
eyeliner highlighter in Luminator I
found this in America I've been looking
for one like it's just a very champagne
e beige but it's extremely pigmented and
it works really well so I'm just going
to add that into water line it just a
bit of a lesson brows illamasqua are
going to use Illamasqua precision brow
gel in or aw a little bit of this little
bit of that
I don't want anything too harsh officer
we're trying to keep this pretty so try
not to too heavy-handed with this
Linna and I think I'm going to go with a
brown liner today but this new one from
Tarte the clay pot dough I'm going to
use this for this I'm going to use Z Z Z
so Viva the zoeva winged liner brush so
start around the middle I'm not keeping
it too thin at the top but this brown
with the Pink's just look so much more
subtle and pretty than adding a nice
thick black line so this is a much
better option I think we are going to
add black eyelashes but I feel the black
line is the most prominent we're going
to part of the wing people can find the
link so I'm just going to line it up to
the eyebrow next simple straight line
and pull it away from it
hold your skin a bit sorta and pull the
brush away done for eyelashes right now
are these bias Kido and I call the oh so
sweet so pretty and then I'm going to
take a new mascara that I've got this is
the doll eyes Hypnose mascara from
Lancome and this is in Brown not about
the black today okay applying my lashes
with some duo adhesive and as you may
have seen me do before I like to apply
it onto a cotton bud first because it's
close mister out will be getting a
little bit more tacky as well already
which is good the tackier your eye lash
glue the easier it is like no joke
honestly it just pours yourself just for
a little longer
I have been known to poke myself in the
eye slightly with this and it hurts a
lot if mine being found very dangerous
be careful but just take the tweezers
along and just wash your lashes onto the
globe all we need now finish this off is
some lipstick
okay so illamasqua fantasy lip pencil
and I feel a null it about - but I'm use
this and this is the nude number one
shade from hourglass and I'm going to
run that through the handle
and just to finish a little bit I'm
gonna use the Gerrard cosmetics clear
smile in buttercream I think we're done
with the dish I'm going to use my leaf
Stafford twisted styler it's an oldie
but it's a goodie and a fan it's pretty
incredible for the kill so I like to
create I mean I'm going to kind of skip
through this because I'm sure you've all
seen me curl my hair before and if not
then I've done do more tutorial style
videos about hair that you can look back
through the beauty playlist on you'll
find them
absolutely boiling okay now kills this
gears are a little bit ridiculous
it's like ringlets but I'm going to give
it five minutes just to cool down and
when we brush our it'll go really big
I'm really pretty thick okay five
minutes I'm going to use my tangle
teezer
to brush through the curls can you see
them kind of opening up I'm just going
all anyway I found these so I want to
use some of the lighter colored the last
ones and I'm just going to pin back off
my hair pulling the sections back it's
all about kind of working with the hair
and making sure that it doesn't look
really flat against your head and you've
got enough here that gets you know some
definition around your ears and then
taking a kerb a grip and pinning it back
and then use need to kind of do the same
on this side it's really easy especially
when you have curly I'll give it because
organized that'd be easier to pull it
back and pin it and put a pin it in same
place on the other side I'm gonna put
you on side and give it a bit of a the
hairspray
I'm also going to get dressed I want to
outfit choices I've chosen two dresses
and two pairs of heels I'm not sure yet
which I'm going to wear so I can try
them on we can try them on together and
see what we think and then I can make a
decision yeah so outfit 1 we have this
really pretty petal pink blush pink
champagne with some gold threads running
through it this is a dress from Tahari I
thought it was really quite
sophisticated summer wedding definitely
prom style as well you could wear it for
but really not the shift' style neckline
coming down this is little gold bail
that really cinches you in a little bit
of a poofy tulip skirt with a bit of
ruching to it and it just comes to just
above the knee so it's quite
sophisticated and pretty length as well
I'm also only Hampton heels in the very
cute baby pink color which I think
you'll be able to use so many more times
after the wedding or after the event it
going to to wear with jeans in the
summer or whether with anything you like
to add fat because it is so neutral and
so easy to wear to go with the whole
look I went with a whistles clutch I'm
in love with the whistles clutches the
leather on them is so beautiful so
thought this was perfect to go with the
outfit just keeping everything quite
bright fresh baby Pink's champagnes
and whites outfit too then guys this is
another dress room to hurry but it's
very different and that it's got this
banding of pearlescent strips running
through the center of this overlooking
this very floral style so I mean it's
quite light and it's quite white in some
places and I'm knowing that meant to
wear white to weddings but the rest of
the colors all over this make it much
more summery feel like you're allowed to
wear this soft dress to your wedding
because it's got so much more color
going on beside it it's got this pearl
beading around the waist and then it's
off pouf out into this long maxi skirt
which is just beautiful so it's very
different to the dress
again it was pulled up at the back with
a sip I've been completely so this is a
size 6 or smaller size they do and it
was seen this brand to slightly oversize
its clothing a little bit so this I
would probably get in two sizes down
from here this to me feels like almost
like an 8 to 10
i pair that with a pair of white pointed
toe heels the lovely long stiletto heel
and cut out around the side of the shoe
so it's a little bit more sexy as well
but the pointed toes will knees keep
them really stylish and quite flattering
as well on the feet just injects a
little bit more color I went to is
another whistles bag you can tell out of
all these bags but this is in the baby
blue leather with the gold strap and I
thought that the bloom would match with
some of the blue tints and colors within
the dress it does I bet a little bit
extra color whereas I thought that if I
went with a white it will just be a
little bit too light
so those are two outfits let me know
which was your favorite down below or
whether you like to poke heels or a
particular bag or a particular dress let
me know Flitz inspired you for some of
your own occasions coming up whether it
be prom
whether it be weddings when it's just a
really lovely summer party going to
