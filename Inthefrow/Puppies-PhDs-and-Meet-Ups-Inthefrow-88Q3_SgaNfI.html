in the fro QA
I can't even remember last time we did
this I think it might have been like May
it was a long time ago I think it is
about time that you guys could ask me
some questions anything that you want
you can ask me so I asked on Twitter at
in throw for your questions and you all
get back to me so I'm gonna go through
to some my faves maybe ones I haven't
been asked before and hopefully you
learn something new have you thought of
any New Year's resolutions yet is so
what are they yes New Year's resolutions
actually I have been thinking about the
first one is to spend much more time
with my best friends and friends I've
made this year I've made so many amazing
friends especially kind of blogging
friends YouTube friends I don't spend a
lot more time within this year I also
want to do a lot more collabs next year
and kind of increase the diversity of my
content making a little bit more
exciting and more diverse and have more
people appear and you know mix things up
a little bit and one other thing I'm
actually doing what you'll probably find
out about in January is I am getting
braces it's been 10 years since I had my
braces off I'm getting lingual braces
put on the back of my teeth and that's
been a resolution of mine for a long
time to get them fixed and get them kind
of perfected so in January around
January 10th I'm going getting them all
put onto my teeth and I'll be giving you
updates and things on that because the
amount of people I've told about this
I've been like I would love braces just
don't know where to go for them or what
to do etc so I'll also leave the link
down below to where I'm going get mine
done really really excited so that's
kind of a big resolution I'm actually
fulfilling so I kind of wait Laura asks
if you have to keep only one eye palette
which one would it be
kisses from France only one eye palettes
I would have to say the lorac mega pro 2
palette that is my favourite eye shadows
in terms of pigmentation and blend
ability and general wearing so I'd
definitely say lorac as a brand as a
whole but the mega 2 has so many in it
so it's almost a bit cheating but if I
had to choose smaller palette I police
say the little Rach - what phd's do
haven't been asses for a while so I'm
gonna answer it again so I did my PhD at
the University of Manchester it took me
three and a half years or so it was in
mobile commerce consumer behavior some
reasons some people think that fashion
is not a degree or isn't hard but isn't
hard work but the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard to be honest any degree
or any PhD or any master's is going to
be difficult
collecting qualitative data I had to
analyze it and so many interviews I had
to transcribe and it took me days and
days of writing it up and had to analyze
it
enter your conclusions on everything
that I found and I wrote it all up I
mean my PhD if I hadn't have cut it down
easily would have been about 175,000
words easily but I had to cut it down to
about 90 so that in itself was difficult
to do my degree was amazing my PhD was
amazing and the fact that I went on to
become a lecturer after that was also
incredible as something I definitely
don't take for granted so I guess to
answer the question in short my PhD was
on mobile consumer behavior cash asks
where do you plan to travel in 2016 as
you probably know 2015 has been crazy
with travel it's been incredible it's
been like the best year ever for travel
so next year talking about lists to play
his out and a go would be Bora Bora by
Australia Vietnam Wow
we love to visit the Scandinavian
countries so Denmark Finland Sweden but
then I'd also love to go back to Canada
again cuz I went a couple years ago and
it's just phenomenal there hopefully
quite a few places I've got a few things
potential and agenda including Canada
including maybe America and also
including France as well so a few things
already on the agenda
filthy rose wash your top tips with
skincare I would say sort of top three
tips would be always always take off
your makeup at night number two would be
to use a cleanser every evening and a
cleansing cloth because I really believe
that taking off your makeup with a
cleansing cloth is probably one the best
ways to get rid of everything off of
your face rather than just using your
hands I think
really kind of grabs on to all your
makeup and third tip would be to really
create a thorough skincare routine early
I'm gonna do a video actually soon on my
skincare routine at night I've got so
many products right now that I
absolutely adore
so I really want to share that with you
so I would just say get yourself some
amazing kind of moisturizer eye cream
lip balm hand cream together it kind of
at least and just get into a routine if
you can get every single day and every
single night when you eat a pack of
Skittles do you say the best flavors
fall out so do they go first
they definitely go first I prefer the
red flavors and the black currant the
purple flavor one they definitely go
first and then generally are soft leave
the rest for Alex de Cali asks what are
your tips for a brunette thinking of
going blonde for the first time I would
definitely say buy yourself some
incredible masks and treatments for your
hair for afterwards I think its massive
they're gonna help your hair brunette is
going to blonde will know that unless
you're extremely lucky your hair will
suffer a little bit to lighten it that
much it's going to be which depends what
color blonde you go and if you just go
for a highlight some kind of a caramel
blonde
you'll probably you'll probably be okay
if you're going for a platinum like me
then it's gonna take a lot of beating I
mean mine does anywhere mine's a blonde
going to a lighter blonde I would just
say buy yourself some incredible hair
products to help you out afterwards like
treatment masks so anything from Shu
Uemura L'Oreal professional pure ology
red can should be all good
what is the saddest most beautiful
lyrics you've ever heard I would
definitely say the saddest song that I
probably know would be a song by Atlanta
Morissette called that particular time
and if you're going through like a
breakup it's an absolutely beautiful fun
to listen to and the way she thinks it's
just so heartfelt you know the lyrics
are just beautiful you should develop
into that song at Melanie asks what are
three albums that really define you or I
have shaped you as a person love you
okay I would say I'm out meaning to be a
large Mercer family alright now say jag
little pill
but last Morissette I would say Jack's
Mannequin everything in transit that was
kind of my college years third album
that really stands out for me
just after kind of college to university
time was coheed and cambria good apollo
and billing staff for volume one that
album i know it back to from front to
back and it was just yeah so defining
moment in my life I think and what other
news music questions Sarah asks what's
your favorite song by The Gaslight
Anthem I would have to say handwritten
just because I've got the tattoo yeah I
really love may as well may handwritten
I mean 59 pounds legendary as well Lydia
are you organized with your blogs I love
them by the way thank you that means a
lot to hear I'm not really organized
ideas kind of come to me and I think I
really let's do that post or maybe
there'll be lots of products that I need
to take pictures off and I get them all
taken all the pictures taken and then on
the day I'll be like I really want to
talk about this product now and that's
when I'll talk about it so it's kind of
more about my passion for it and how
much I really want to talk about that
thing at that time
that is when I'll put it up otherwise
not that organized but 2016 I really
want to be much more organized well like
this one lucy asks if you could spend
dinner with any five people in the whole
entire world who would you pick
dinner with five people I would choose
Jaclyn hill because I'd love to meet her
and I think she's hilarious Victoria
Beckham because I just want to pick her
brains and she's just a total legend
probably David Beckham as well because
why not bring them both together this is
good to look at Stephen Tyler because
it's just like a total rock legend I
think he'd be very very funny a dinner
party would hopefully get very drunk and
it was be hilarious and this would be
maybe Anna Wintour because again I think
that would be so interesting and I'd
love to see how she kind of interacts in
a group she didn't know that well I
think that the really
Lydia asks will you do me to forget yes
I would love to my last nice one was
amazing and it went so well and it was
incredible I would love to do another
Meetup
maybe next time with other youtubers
quite cool or maybe a bit of a bigger
event where I can see more of you but
then again I won't get to spend as much
time with you so 2016 I definitely would
love to do an international and a UK
Meetup so fingers crossed force in space
kisi asks at what point did you decide
to make this your full-time job and was
it an easy decision to make
or a tough one okay I kind of want to
answer this because I've had a few
people over time make comments on the
fact that I'm now a youtuber rather than
a lecturer and I've thrown away my PhD
figured I might as well answer this
question and answer that negativity at
the same time I was a lecturer for 18
months at the University of Manchester
it was incredible and the fact I was a
lecturer at the age of 24 was something
I'll never take for granted I have some
incredible colleagues and I really
really enjoyed it however at the same
time I started my blog and also starting
achieve and it started to get a lot more
busy and things got really exciting and
I think it's very judgmental of someone
to say that they think I should have
stayed in that career rather than
choosing this career I now have
lecturing under my belt and also have my
PhD if I decided I wanted to go back
into education and lecturing the chances
that I probably could do if I really
have that passion still so I haven't
thrown anything away I still got it I
still got that qualification and I still
have the fact that I worked as a
lecturer for that amount of time I still
have very good friendships and
relationships with some of my old
colleagues and I worked with and if I
decide that I would like to go back into
lecturing then I will do that something
I can do in the future because I have
that qualification now however at the
moment I am enjoying my life I'm
enjoying making YouTube videos
I'm joying writing my blog and working
with new people every single week
meeting new people I'm enjoying my life
and I love meeting all of you guys that
watch my videos I love meeting new
Browns all the time and
visiting new countries and it's
something I could not do if I was still
lecturing and I'm just really enjoying
this moment here and now like I'm living
for here and now I'm not thinking right
now about what I'm going to be needing
to do in 10 years 20 years time because
I just believe that if you work hard and
you'll get to places you meant to be
anyway
I ended up doing something else in the
future so be it that'll be what my path
was meant to have left me down anyway
and more of you guys suck to follow me
and more people start to take notice and
really enjoy what I was doing and they
got support my just couldn't do both
anymore it just got too busy I was doing
two full time jobs I had absolutely no
time at all
I was sleeping for about four or five
hours per night and getting back up
again and it was just it was just a
really difficult time so yeah so I made
it full-time and I haven't looked back
I'm extremely happy I've got some
incredible people around me I would not
regret anything
tertiary nights planning on getting any
pets soon the answer is yes the issue
though is that we need a house or we
need a flat with a garden so I am coming
and looking for new places to live in
London that couldn't hopefully have a
little puppy we really really want a
sausage dog I have loved sausage dogs
ever since I was little it's always been
the dog well I mean honestly there were
years when I was told I love pugs as
well and I love rainy ins but it's
always been the sausage dog that I've
gone back to and every time they walk
past ministry I'm just a cooing mess you
can ask Alex I'm just always like oh my
god I just adore them I think they're
the most beautiful cutest little animals
in the world I've always always wanted
one so this isn't me jumping on the
bandwagon and saying I want a sausage
dog because x y&amp;amp;z have sausage dog it
just happens that they they bought one
as well so yes I'll have to get a little
girl soon it just depends on how soon we
move so can't wait Zoe asks where would
be your dream wedding location you know
it's our gonna get married in Vegas I've
decided and Alex is luckily quite happy
about it so yeah definitely Vegas I
adore Vegas I think it's equally
hilarious form
just a little bit crazy I think people
either love I hate Vegas and I've seen
that from both sides but the times I've
visited I've just had the best time and
I just when I go I just wanna have a
party
take all my friends on my family and
just have a massive party in Vegas so
that is what we're gonna do I think
that's all we've got time for that's
probably a lot longer than I intended it
to be but thank you so much for all of
your questions it was so so many so
thank you so much to everyone who
participated and gave me questions they
were really really good I'm just sorry
it's been so long since my last Q&amp;amp;A if
you like this video make sure to give it
like and subscribe if you're new and
come back next time I'm not be awesome I
will see you guys really really soon
take care until then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
