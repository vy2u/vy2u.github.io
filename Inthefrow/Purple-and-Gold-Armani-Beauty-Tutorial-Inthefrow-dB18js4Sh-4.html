know chill in my office doing my makeup
so I'm gonna film a video and I kind of
felt like you know just chatting with
you and kind of showing you what I was
doing because generally when I do a
makeup it's all quite very similar using
a lot of similar products but I was
playing around with some new gorgeous
products from Giorgio Armani to go on my
blog and I was playing around with them
and they actually the finish of them
it's actually really beautiful so I
thought you know what I need to kind of
tell you about it and you can kind of
come along with me as I do with the rest
of my eyes it's gonna be a gold and
purple eye I just want to kind of play
around a little bit by the way today I
just been to the LMS Spa it's their new
brand new spa absolute beautiful modern
and it's just so gorgeous I had a hot
stone massage I had a scalp massage so
I'm feeling so much better now and they
also did an eyelash tint which is why my
eyelashes look darker than normal and
often I Bratton now in only is quite
dark it's because I've been playing
around with the brow product for this a
lot which was the eyebrow maestro from
Joe Giovanni and it's in the shade when
would this it's quite dark when it's
literally like a dark brown almost black
but I just wanna play around and I
really like dark brows so I just kind of
filled in because my brows look great I
want it to fill it up a few bits I'll
just make them really thick and yeah a
lot of people they won't like this but I
actually quite liked it anyway start
with so I went in with the Vichy ID I
Delia life serum followed by the one
only million dollar moisturizer from
lush I then went in with quite a lot of
new products
Giorgio Armani do so many cool products
that you pull it up if I know about I
don't really know about them
and I recently have been experimenting
so much more these to mainly fluid shear
and my extra liquid summer so the fluid
shear this comes like fired from Korres
and it's all about creating you can use
it lots different ways you need to
underneath makeup he's over your makeup
he needs it as blush highlight bronze
anything you like
so come soon I think it's five different
colors that I've seen anyway and it's
all about just creating this kind of
luminous and glowing whatever kind of
cooler regions that you want to create I
use this one this is shade ten I use
this all over the face before I then
went in with a luminous silk foundation
in shade for sleeves all over and I
would also highly recommend using a
Beauty Blender with the luminous silk I
was using a brush this brush and I
wasn't getting the effect I wanted so
Anton more with the Beauty Blender and
managed to make it much more perfected
so big win with that one then to create
the kind of contour and bronzer that I
have I'm getting so sick of powder
bronzers making me look really powdery
and a bit dull so I went with this which
is the maestro liquid summer bronzer and
obviously a little bit scared a little
bit unsure exactly how I'd use it but I
just use any kind of fun normal
foundation brush this is a zoeva silk
finish applied on the back of my hand
and this comes out if it looks like and
just looks like a bronzer color
he's dipped it in the brush stick pulled
it onto the areas that I wanted to
create the kind of bronze lock and it
just sniffles on really nicely and I
just sort of bronzed it round the face
on for the temples under the cheekbones
and it just creates so much more of a
natural bronze look rather than some
something really harsh it's just because
it's a liquid product it blends into
skin so much nicer so that's I did and
then for this kind of blush shade and
then use the fluid share in shade 17
they only have numbers they don't have
colors I thought it's almost like a deep
Rose I thought it would look really
beautiful as a blush and I was right
so again I just understand once back my
hand used my ordinary blush brush pushed
it into it brushed it off and then just
brushed it over and it just looks really
illuminated and beautiful so rather fond
of that a little bit powder I went in
with the new luminous silk compact so
it's a compact that matches the
foundation if you prefer compacts and I
just used it to go over any kind of to
set everything in place that's what I
did by the way so it's not a sponsored
video at all it's just because I wanted
to try all of these products out as kind
of a one face Giorgio Armani thing for
the blog it's just turned out that I
really like what I'm doing stuff that
I'll show you and then over top of that
I've used a highlight the new highlight
that they've got and use that top of
cheekbones it's quite nice subtle what
beautiful natural glow
unlike said I use the alien brow maestro
in number two to get these big hefty
brows oh and all my lips I'm ellipsis
not Armani this time but it's I'm really
loving this it's called mirror Ness I've
never heard of them before but no Ness
and it's the lip color lip duo liner and
it's an crazy Coco and I'm using a
lighter shade to get the line and I feel
it the filled in my lips as well it's
beaut over the top I use a nude sticks
pencil in love this is the this is the
lip and cheek pencil I really love these
a lot so I use that all over the lips
okay it's very muted pink nude and those
okay new winning new winning lip color
that is first show as I said I'm gonna
go in with these two beautiful colors
and actually don't really know I'm going
to do with it so I'm just thinking that
they look beautiful together some
thinking kind of lid shade cliched I'm
just gonna go in with a gold this is the
Giorgio Armani I tint in the shade 13
and it is the most bright luminescent
kind of
sunshine gold it's gonna add that on to
Little Italy look at us that she like
born my way for anyone that's wondering
why I didn't de film everything I just
talked about I asked myself that same
question that is so next up lip Appel
this is shade 15 and as well if you've
read my blog before I did a massive blog
post a while back on all of these but
not me this is like new colors he's and
new colors but I did numbers 1 to 12 in
this collection we're on the blog so if
you're interested in a few more of these
then just go have a peek I'm just
building up with cooler do you can I
just want to do the inner corner as well
like just go all out certainly do it and
try it
a little bit more incredible that's cool
okay let's see a bit of London here now
guys on this purple with this gold and
make it look good I'm really enjoying
that purple on the very inner corner
going into this I like dirty gold but
much more purp on the outside
I actually really quite like it I'm
gonna quickly try and go through again
exactly what I did okay yeah so okay so
the gold is very much kind of centered
here a little bit up into the crease but
not too much then when I put some purple
into this very inner corner
but then if we get working this air and
with a brush I've got this Real
Techniques brush just a lot it's all
about kind of keeping that gold there
you can kind of dirt you over a little
bit just a little bit
I'd look at mortar here because I feel
like this the other side of a little bit
more pigmented color going on so I guess
with this look it's just about building
these colors you know what I think you
want to leave it there quite like what
I've got going on right now I don't want
to do any more to it what I'm now going
to do is I'm going to use the matching
eyeliner say I've got one for the gold
and I do have one for the purple but I'm
gonna go in with purple eyeliner against
this shade eight in the eyeliner and I'm
just gonna line my lashline
and you know what we do use this gold
once I think I'm gonna try a bit of
lower lashes who's gonna give it up - I
really love this lipstick I think this
is my new favorite definitely I'm just
going to try a little bit in the very
center and you feel the good deep earth
one again just to bring this down and
almost join it it's like gold meet
purple just gonna put a little bit can
see there and a little bit of right now
on to here so I've just added some
concealer Clarins instant concealer as
well so just finish off the whole look
I'm just gonna use this shorty Oh Marni
mascara oh my eyes give them the best
head start you could possibly have
I really like this brush really nice
brush it is so nice I've got loads of
product in it so it really cooks your
lashes I can tell already it's not gonna
keep the curl but for any of you guys
that have curly lashes this is oh nice
and that's how oh look what you think I
know it's very experimental and kind of
very off-the-cuff but I just kind of
fancy chatting with you and just sit
down with you and doing something a bit
different and I feel like through this I
found a new favorite evening very dark
smoky golden shimmering I look like I
think it's really cute and with this
like a little pop of the gold you can
kind of see whenever it catches alive
but obvious is very kind of smoky at the
same time very dark you just need to
kind of be careful about your concealer
and making sure you kind of concealed
under the eyes then obviously the eye is
just really seductive and dark and sexy
and all just the skin is really if we're
gonna flawless and perfected so I
actually really love it let me know down
below what you thought of it that is it
for this kind of random video I hope you
really enjoyed it please - give me like
who did it and subscribe below if y'all
know I put out a lot more videos twice a
