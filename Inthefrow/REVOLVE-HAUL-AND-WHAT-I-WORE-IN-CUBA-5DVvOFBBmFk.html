all doing so so well and welcome to
night what I want in Qbert video
hopefully you've already seen my
Maldives video and my Sri Lanka video as
they were kind of recent videos that I
put out in terms of my travel content so
maybe got some outfit and spoke from
those I hope so if not then maybe we'll
find something in this video that you
really really like you're like a user
dude I'm just going to go back to my
Instagram at in the fro if you don't
follow me then please do it really good
to have you over there because I post
pretty much every outfit as I wear it I
will post that day all posts up the next
day so it's a good reminder for me for
exactly what I actually wore going to
start off with the first thing on the
list which is this swimsuit this is a
collaboration piece between guests and a
bikini a day which is run by Kasia
Oakley and Deborah Bookman if you follow
them on Instagram show your holiday
they're absolute babes today run a
bikini a day and they have just
collaborated with guests to create a
really cool swimwear collection not
overly sexy but also super flattering
and I absolutely love this swimsuit it's
cooked quite short on the side which
means it gives you a little bit size we
have not too much and not so much that
you feel like your beads can fall out a
little bit side boob look at that side
boob it is quite high into the crops
that really just kind of come straight
over I really like that it's kind of
quite retro style if they watch it so
I'll do this by day so on that exact day
over the top of that swimsuit
I want a brand new pair of Levi's shot
you cannot be a good pair of vintage
Levi's short and even with a black pair
with lots of distressing to the bottom
some little cuts here lots of frame
around the edges four buttons of the
front and two pockets it's nice and
simple just fit really nicely but kind
of like a mid to high waist fit and
they're not too short on the Bob I hate
it when you feel it a really rise that
we born like a pair of knickers so I
didn't feel too uncomfortable in these I
thought it was quite nice flattering
shape so big big fan and with that I
wore this really gorgeous Phil T now
this is so kind of casual for me I don't
usually wear especially slogans I don't
really wear slogan t-shirts but I
absolutely love this little top I
thought it was really quite preppy just
something very cute about it I felt for
a holiday
as you like to dress down I'm on holiday
sometimes like slightly really casual so
this is a mink pink collaboration piece
with Disney so it's for the new boots in
the B cell such as enchanted on it is a
very sweet little red and cream top so I
wore those together now I did get chance
to wear this I'm really gutted but
seeing from doing a bit of a kind of
holy feel with this video I want to show
you the skirt that goes with that top so
this is the skirt that goes with that
whole collection it's canna Disney mink
pink aberration and this is sort of like
the beauty skirt with a beautiful red
roses on it but look at that cut the way
it's cut across the front and then you
have these long sections I really love
and it's just really simple on the back
but it's got more it's kind of flares
out a lot more a line than my usual kind
of mini skirts and I really like it and
disgusted that I didn't have another day
to wear this so that was packed in my
suitcase nonetheless and with that
outfit I'll show you this now because
you're going to see these probably a lot
in this video but on that day I was
wearing these shoes so these are like
Valentina rock stuff sandals and
honestly one of the best investments
I've made I knew I'd get a lot of wear
out these and that is definitely for
sure I have worn these the entire
holiday pretty much in Cuba I was
wearing these shoes and what components
got sales laughs the whole trip was with
Virgin holidays I work with virgin quite
a lot they're an amazing team it's a
great room to be affiliated with I've
been working with them on quite a few
different trips big big fan of virgin
and I mean I go to the Virgin gym we
have virgin broadband bit of virgin
loyal fan together that evening we went
doing so salsa listen spot for that
night I wore this dress and honestly I
have so much love this dress it's a
beautiful coral pink salmony color why
I'd recommend though is wearing a cute
little lacy bra lips or a band down bra
underneath just to show a bit of lace
here it looks quite cute actually in the
cleavage area it also will make you feel
a little bit more kind of secure and
kept in if you have slightly larger
boobs than me than your plug you
probably be absolutely fine in this
dress because it will fill it out more
and therefore there will be as much gap
and space in between you should be
absolutely fine but overall the fabric
is beautiful it's so floaty so this was
from
revolve this is about my revolt haul of
this video while
you about how I wore them so yes
absolutely love that goes down into more
kind of maxi MIDI - maxi kind of length
and it has lots of beautiful fabric at
the bottom to give it lots of movement
and texture as well makes this absolute
stunning I love that bit so with a dress
I want a new pair of sandals these are
suede beige blush I first got like a
beige e light pink blush shade jumping
to a Rossi of course because there
mat-su favorites very comfortable very
easy to wear I wore these a lot of
evening outfits and in this Collette
they go with everything and with those I
want my Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana
clutch bag you have a beautiful
hand-painted apparently roses all over
it and also to the back beautiful gold
lock enclosure so starching Ivana here
which I absolutely love that detail and
it's polka dot inside I don't know if
you've already I'm kind of waiting pass
this because I've already shown it a few
times but if you're new here or she's
not seen my videos the past few weeks
then you may not seen this and as
helpless smitten with it it's
beautifully made oh I just love this
jumpsuit I think a lot of you guys going
to love this jumpsuit this is a brand
new jumpsuit it's black with beautiful
floral print all over it super
comfortable easy like not too baggy wide
legs just a really good flattering shape
nothing too tight and it wraps around if
you've ever sort of the refere on the
back I mean you could tie it either way
I'm pretty sure I may have tied it
around the front into a little bow and I
also like the fact that at the back of
the bag it also has another little tie
so it ties here and it also goes down
into the back of the jumpsuit and I'm
pretty sure it was like 35 pounds when I
bought it in the store oh yeah links
down below to that bad boy on that day
so this is a pitbull sort of a picture
I'm looking at the one of me on the
bridge drinking a pina colada in a
pineapple I wore it with this bag which
again you'll have seen quite a few times
now I'm so glad I put yourself I've had
so many compliments on this so far it's
a baby blue Valentino bag with the gold
hardware absolutely adore this strap I
think it's so different from what I see
before that Valentino is made and real
of the way it's been put together it
feels so well made
and it's a so much room there circles
kind of like my everyday handbag I took
this on the play with me to and from to
black and white my little handbag and it
was perfect so it worked really well
with this outfit as well and with the
outfit I wore my Valentino sandals but
I've already mentioned them okay I think
I posted these instagrams back to front
but then there was this guy this was so
amazing we went to this little farm in
Huber say little farm it's quite a big
farm but it kinda was like an artistic
neat agricultural farm but on that day I
wore a very kind of nice casual outfit
can you compete boiling part which it
was which started with this top so
stopping again from revolves as fast
merry Valhalla talkative so this is a
little top very cute
I mean I love bottle tops are so easy to
throw on but on this day it was just a
really nice little piece to wear what
mark I say I really like this and I wore
it with these little short which of my
favorites at the moment needs a pair of
Stella McCartney shorts with the polka
dots all over them and they fit
wonderfully like on the bone they fit so
nicely but gives a really nice rounded
bone shape don't know why it just fits
really really well on me I got this in
the size 24 and I'm you jackass 6 I
usually get like a 25 in Topshop but I
always find that when I buy my luxury
designer pieces that jeans are short I
always need to size down a little bit to
know what it is so i'ma like to get a
little bit more room so 24 fits like a
dream for me so water and there's my
accessory I took this with me I don't
know what made me pick this out of my
collection take it with me I think it's
because of the color I wanted something
really cool to take long and I haven't
worn this in ages it's back on line I
leave a link down below its back because
it's so rare online and you could not
get your hands on it it's that can it
also now comes in the most incredible
it's almost like a raspberry violet
color big Sammy has it I think I've seen
Kenya with it it's beautiful and if it
wasn't for the fact I had this up early
with value the words but I don't need to
do it took this with me and that was my
eye piece for this outfit oh and then
for the shoes how cute are these
espadrilles these are a pair of red
Valentino espadrilles with flamingos on
them so I had these Musa part of my
outfit oh I feel like I should also
mention some
super house so I had these Fendi
palladium 53 millimeters I'm not sure
article actually classes with me which I
adore they're just so extra and a bit
retro and super cat I love those two
pieces so again I kind of took those as
majors to get that kind of like Cuba in
Havana vibes and I also took with me and
all the body goodie my Ray Ban aviators
I love these I'm a huge rebound fan I
have a lot of Ray Ban sunglasses I'm a
big fan of how they look on made yet so
I took code with me - okay so we finally
made it to Havana and that's when I wore
this beautiful sherry dress so - again
for revolve it's so pretty it's a cream
and it has red and green cherries all
over it again with an awful low neckline
it wasn't quite as low as the red dress
so I don't feel like I had to wear a bra
with this in fact I barely wah-wah did I
wear that I don't think I wore a bra
this entire holiday it was wonderful I
have some lovely slits in it for a bit
more movement as well in fact this needs
a wash went to a guy's restaurant and
then we went watching the club Tropicana
show which was crazy and amazing and
just so wore that this night but I only
had four pairs of shoes you guys would
be so proud of me I used to pack so
meanwhile shoes amid but this was the
fourth pair of shoes that I took it was
a pair of my job' to a Ruffy sandals
again they want anything too high but I
love these sandals the dot I don't
simply do this color anymore but do lots
of other colors in this style
the tying a really flattering way up
your ankles I sort of tie it round twice
and then since it'll go at the back so
it just work nicely with the green in
the dress and it is very comfortable for
that evening and again without the
stranded green I went with a Gucci
Marmont sells it back there's also a
night unfortunately I didn't get a
picture but was also a night when I wore
this jumpsuit and I want to mention it
because I'm a huge fan of this and again
I wore it in the Maldives
and in Sri Lanka and don't really think
I got many pictures of it so this is
some page and it's a very dark denim
jumpsuit it almost reminds me of a
boiler suit in a way but it goes down
into two wonderful ooh
my legs can you see wide legs it has two
buckets from the bum pockets on the
front and quite a nice very easy
neckline honestly it doesn't kind of
look like much here but it's so
flattering on and just with a pair of
beautiful stilettos on easy parry
sandals it just looks so lovely and
again I got so many compliments on my
wall base it was such an easy piece to
throw on then it was our second day in
Havana which by the way is insane you
have to visit if you can yeah and you've
probably heard all about the Cuban cars
which is what I was super excited about
this is one of the classic self-portrait
dress shapes you're placing this
everywhere in their lace with the nude
backing underneath and just down into
the beautiful skirt this very classic
shape and what self-portrait can have
became known for when they kind of
boomed a couple years back back in stock
for know all these without stocks so
fast when they first came out but now
they're back and I got one so the links
down below and again on that day a
wallet with the jumpy tool russy's and
then a little bit after that that's
before we left I had one more outfit to
wear and that was this dress again from
resolve beautiful peachy cream lace
dress off the shoulder it have a
sweetheart neckline have a little bit of
boning in it as well as going to keep it
up
I got listened an extra small and to -
it's a little bit a little bit too big
it kept almost slightly falling down a
tiny bit it was better with a Brar on
that I would very much recommend getting
a bra that's almost the same colors this
or else you'll keep seeing wrap or
otherwise absolutely loved it it was
great I got so many compliments on it I
felt super feminine really pretty and it
has felt very kind of sweet but yet I
would just bear that in mind maybe size
down a size if you're able to if not an
extra small already than our size down a
size potentially the only thing to worry
about then is if it's going to be too
short for you to just sort of bear that
in mind if you can but I love that dress
of it so I wore that because the color
that I wore it with my dolce gabbana
clutch which I thought it looks super
cute with I think it was a Ray Ban
aviators and again I wore it as my
Valentino's could this worked really
really well with the colors so there are
two help users to mention that I didn't
get to wear on the trip
really good about but I have them with
me again from revolve loser part of the
revolve Hall that I did first off being
this top or my grass that color is
amazing it looks so neon on the camera
here it's amazing I mean it is actually
really really bright it does a Bardot
top very similar actually I think it's
the same brand that dress as it kind of
has its boning to the body of it here
but on the inside it's got a like a
panel so it goes all the way around your
bees comes to hold it up and sort of
splits at the back there's a very pretty
design beautiful color I don't have
anything like this on to something very
vibrant can get to wear it but I will
wear it on my next trip I am sure and
the only other piece I didn't get to
where is this beautiful dress which is
so creased it's that kind of fabric that
just creases as soon as you look at it
it's from the same collection as that
beautiful coral salmony dress and it's
this one in a nude beige but on me I
don't think it's quite right in terms of
color but the style is stunning they
have leaves that are gathered at the
bottom very similar shape to the other
dresses very mine as well it is very
very very low-cut like you need
amazingly big boobs for this kind of
skip better or again just wear a bra
underneath a very cute lacy bra that
you're happy to get my pod show and it
goes down into a gorgeous maxi length
with a beautiful slit on the right
person this could look absolutely dreamy
