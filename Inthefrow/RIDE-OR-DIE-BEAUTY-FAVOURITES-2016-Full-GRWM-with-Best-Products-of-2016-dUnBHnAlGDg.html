hope you had the best New Year's Eve and
the best 2016 happy new year
welcome back to my channel so today I
figured it was about time that I went
through all of my favorites count
ride-or-die products for 2016 and
because I did really France is talking
through everything I have tried on
everything on my face on my hair for you
to see so it's kind of like this is my
full face of ride-or-die and you get to
see exactly what went into it so I might
as well skip straight insist it's gonna
be quite a hefty video I hope you enjoy
it yeah let's get to it
okay so kicking off my bearskin fish
vault with serum and my favorite of the
year is definitely the Armani Prima
serum it's just really hydrating it
feels wonderful on a skin is a really
nice base to put your moisturizer over
the top of it has this great pick into
your fingertips it also smells
incredible it's just one of those
products that I like really highly enjoy
putting on every day that's why it gets
number one spot okay next up moisturizer
there were two in the running for this
and I felt like one of them really gave
me the benefits that I truly want to see
every day that I do my foundation and
that is like super juhi hydrated skin so
I did have to go for la Mer and whilst
it does cost an absolute fortune and I'm
already at the very bottom of this I'm
out in fact this might be the last time
I ever use it I really really want to
buy a new top and I think I will that's
how much I love this so I like to take
that onto the back of my hand and then i
use the renewal oil which again just
makes that super juhi finish to the skin
I mean I have quite dry skin so this
works super well for me but also have a
lot of kind of skincare properties
inside this which just make it so
luxurious it's mixed together and then
apply it onto the skin and also if
you're wondering the two of the
moisturizers apollo' could have named as
well we've been the Armani primer balm
which is absolutely beautiful and I also
would say the lush million dollar
moisturizer as well which which if you
been watching my channel for a while you
know
I wore pretty much every single time I
did my makeup okay next up would be
primer and in RC I don't always prime my
face again because it's quite dry I
often just go in with moisturizer and
straight on my foundation but if I had
to choose absolute favorite and in total
honesty like I can't choose products is
for the sake of it I honestly would
again go for the lemare this is the
perfecting treatment and again is
extremely pricey but unlike the
moisturizer this has so much product
inside it and will last me for ages but
it just gives another really hydrating
finish to the skin while priming it and
prepping it and just overall perfecting
I just love putting this on okay since
the one that most people usually like to
know about and that is foundation I've
had quite a few over the year but what I
thought about it I thought of one
especially that I used over and over and
over and whenever anyone asked me what
my favorite foundation was I would
always say this and that would be the
Armani maestro glow it's just super dewy
it has an oil consistency I have five
essential oils in here that evaporate
over the day so it just gives that ultra
Juliette pigmented finish it's so
flawless I love it so much so I'm going
to mix two and four together to get my
shades on in between a tan but I'm also
going to mix it with one that I have
been obsessed with NASA past two and a
half three months and that would be the
NARS Velvet Matte skin tint which I can
see is more of a tinted moisturizer with
a bit more pigmentation and a bit more
of a full of coverage well it's kind of
more medium coverage than a tinted
moisturizer would be but honestly I
don't go anywhere without this now which
is where I had to mention it it's so
brilliant it's in the shade Alaska it's
like such a good shade for me and I love
mixing it with anything else I'm using
because it just get a little bit more
coverage I just know it just makes my
skin look really really flawless and
great so it's going to apply a little
bit of this alongside some of the
maestro glow and now without a huge
concoction on the back of my hand and
then use my favorite foundation brush
that I've been using
whenever I'm applying foundations like
this and that would have to be this one
next to me it's almost like a duo fiber
brush but when you apply it it just sort
of rather than taking up all the
foundation to the brush it allows you to
get so much product off of the brush
and onto your face so I find I use this
as my first dip into the foundation
first of all then I'm going to use at my
favorite kind of face tool it's gotta be
the Beauty Blender I have a few of these
now I cannot live without them and
that's when I just go back over all the
product and blend it in
okay concealer is like next products
that everyone seems to like to know
about because there's so many concealers
on the market some work some don't and
they're just so much to choose from so
in honesty I often use a bit concoction
every day change it up every day so that
being pointless in me saying this is my
absolute favorite because if it was I
would wear it every single day but one I
would definitely say made a lot of the
year while seat bareMinerals best skin I
always got this in fair I think but such
a brilliant concealer absolute door this
one but that's all right now otherwise
big big fan of the Burberry cashmere
concealer which is super cute Bunch tip
it just works extremely well and if not
then leak having a quad sensible skin
enhancer just kind of like that bad boy
sit concealing product that will just
clear up everything so so this all sits
on the back of my fingertip and just dab
on like I said this is one thick
heavy-duty concealer but it really works
and it really does a job and I've got
quite a bit of redness today so do with
some help okay so full base applied it's
exactly how I like it like super Joey
really kind of hydrated looking pretty
flawless full coverage base can't really
cover up some of these spots because
they're just uncover Bowl so I'm just
living with it but you know this is how
I like to get my base to look so the
products I generally go to if I'm after
this sort of finish so bronzer and there
are two or three I've sort of used a lot
especially one over the past few months
has totally blown me away and I wish I'd
had it for the past few years in honesty
and that is the slate an additionnal and
I've seen silly people using this I
didn't why didn't buy it sooner but it
just works is such a dream with my skin
and I adore using it so so much so I'll
supply bit up first and they also apply
it with the makeup forever brush one
five two and I just get the product up
in there and I just work it into my
cheeks but in honesty I always use two
bronzers anyway
to use a kind of a cream and a little
bit of powder on the brush I like to use
most is the Giorgio Armani this is a
bronzing brush the biggest one it is
what I always always use and if I am
bronzing generally for the most this
year it's either being a girl and
bronzer this one being terracotta Four
Seasons in natural which is beautiful oh
I have this nails palette and I kind of
concocted my own palette out of it out
of lots of different products for you
products from makeup geek in here a few
products from iconic London which are
totally I need to get rid of those now
and anastacio Beverly Hills but this is
the NARS Laguna bronzer as everyone
music likes it's an oldie and a goodie
as much applies a touch more bronze and
I also want to use the bronzing powders
to Brahmas down the neck you can't
really do that with green products for
blush I've got to again because I use
these two interchangeably and by far my
favorites first one being the Charlotte
Tilbury first love and I think this is
probably my last year's favorite too
it's just my perfect color I absolutely
adore it I'm going for cream that I go
for the Kevin a quad and this is in
prevail at our Chanel which should place
see me use a lot but again this kind of
creamy shade is exactly what I really
like like a nudey pink for powder I'm
one of those people that can give or
take powder generally because I'm quite
dry and I prefer the module look
sometimes I just leave it without but
there are times when I've got a little
bit overboard with the oils I need a
touch of powder and by far the best one
that definitely works the best I think
is Laura Mercier translucent powder it's
just one that people talk about the most
and for good reason it's so brilliant it
doesn't cake and I like to use that on a
damp tiny Beauty Blender and it gets
right into the inner corners where I
concealed
just a little bit into there for
highlight there are so many I could say
so so many but I think the one that
looks the most beautiful on the skin it
doesn't look like powdery and too glitzy
it has to be the dual skin nude air
Luminizer in 0 0 1 it's just absolutely
beautiful and my favourite brush which
is the our satiable hills I brush I
think ok eyeshadow I would love to tell
you there has been Apollo that's blowing
my mind this year but in honesty of use
so so many different things I
it's mainly pots of eyeshadow a bit my
favorite which I can't believe I'm
saying if it had to be one part I use
the most
at least eight with lorac mega pro 2 and
there are so many insane
shades in here that I've used a lot and
I highly recommend palette absolutely
love it but I kind of feel like I used
more of my pots of shadows and I did
anything else so I'm just going to use a
few of those today just going to show
you what my faves all right I mean first
up I always like to use a really nice
transition shade like everyone else
stills didn't quite peachy bronzy Browns
so I often went for something like this
in the lorac palette use a bit tawny a
bit of melon bit sorbet just those three
just something very subtle and a touch
natural but you can find this in most
pallets you could even use your bronzer
for this one of my favorite blending
brushes as always is this one max 207
and then pretty much any brush by zoeva
is just a total winner it's going to go
back in with a bit more of the brown
shade intensified a touch more and also
just make it touch larger over the eye
okay when I'm using to refute my
different favorite pots so we've got the
Burberry eye color cream these are so
beautiful this is the one in mink
they're just like creamy but not too
like this super blendable super easy to
work is work your brush into it it picks
up the product the same 8 would have
powder really but it does add a little
bit more kind of luminosity to lids
I'm just going to fly that all over lid
that's just a really super wearable
everyday color love that one okay and
next look probably my most worn I
shudder of the entire year and that's a
Tom Ford spice pot and I love just to
kind of use it to deepen up the crease
and add more of a deeper creamier finish
to the outer edge of this eye
it's almost like a really intense smoky
lock but it catches the light
beautifully I love it so so much but one
more product want to give a shout out to
as well are the Chanel pots this is the
rouge noir illusion to ombre that's how
you say it but they come in a lot of
different beautiful colors and this is
one of my absolute favorites the brush
ma which had more of a purple tone and
recently I've lit has been using a
little bit on a brush and going over
more of the brown tones I've been using
and it just creates a bit more of a
purpley finish doing it quite a lot
recently in videos so I really like the
purple tones on the eyes but these are
eye shadows in general are such a good
Cannes makeup kit keeper such a health
air with you just for any look you want
to go for that beautiful and one last I
shadow just to mention I have it inside
my NARS kick so I wanted to make sure
this litter goes with me everywhere I go
I hit this mask it it's super flat to
pack with me and it's this little shadow
here this is out of a L'Oreal palette
row shade I'll leave it linked down
below for you but this was like the
lightest shade in that palette and I
took it out there put it in here cuz I
knew I'd use it every single day and I
do and it's my favorite in a corner
highlight eyeliner if I'm using eyeliner
it's usually the Tom Ford eye defining
pen because it's absolutely incredible I
got to use the longer end just to get a
really really good wink for mascara
there are two big-time standouts this
year if I didn't mention the Clarence
Waterford mascara which you can like my
favorite most of the time well if I'm
not using that I'm using one of these
two and it's the l'oreal fall flash
sculpt this just gets right into the
root of the lash it's super black it
separates it lengthens it volumizes it
is just one of those wonderful mascara
it doesn't budge all day as well it
doesn't transfer it's just an absolute
winner if not then the armani at Senko
mascara has been my absolute go to again
it's very lengthening but it also adds a
bit more volume and really kind of thick
and sort of the look of the lashes
especially when I've gotten LVL lash
lift at the time so my lashes are really
kind of full and killed anyway this just
goes on outside beautifully quite a lot
of times I've taken instagram pictures
and I've had really no flashes it'll be
because I was wearing this and quite
often I get compliments on it and I was
saying this is a Twinner I need to use
it more eyebrows hands-down the best
brush ever is this by Armand
it's that eyebrow brush pretty much it's
got spoolie one end and the brush the
other end I don't use anything but this
and in terms of two products
I'd say nine months of this year we're
by far the eyebrow my stroke by Armani
whose one incredible eyebrow product is
a wonderful deep chocolate brown
I like having dark brows and it just
kind of stays put all day it's a
wonderful wonderful shade what for the
past three months or so I remembered how
much I loved the Anastasia I'm not sure
whether it's Anastacio or Alice Asia I
would say on stage I was gonna say that
the Anastasia dip brow pomade is in
chocolate as well yes so those two
products
I'd say are kind of interchangeably
wonderful I'm going to go with I'm brow
maestro for today seeing as I I've used
this the most this year okay does it set
the brows in place
my favorite brow grooming product has to
be this Yvonne sheet mister brow grew
it's not gonna budge and their lips and
I'd probably say my favorite lip liner
still would be either Mac whirl or Mac
saw because I know it's gonna give me
the shade I really really like probably
my favorite lip products of the year and
they have to be the Anastasia Beverly
Hills liquid lips so I'm going to use my
favorite concoction which is crush and
like I said when I use this I don't
usually even need to line the lips
because it almost does it for you love
that shade so much so where that mostly
if not I wear pure Hollywood if I just
want a full color lip I wear that but
I'm gonna go for the ombre lip which is
not my favorite things to do this year
my favorite for that is the milkshake
shade and what I'll do is to supply
that's the center and I use my finger to
dab it in and the final product on the
face has to be the setting spray so you
rip by far is it I'm very by far is the
Urban Decay makeup setting spray
long-lasting which I think I'm about to
run out off which is just great I'm a
filer product to mention is this by
iconic London I couldn't not mention it
seeing as I've literally use this every
day
the past year it's just like my third
now I think but inside here it's just a
really great concealing and contouring
palette and I like having this with NYX
I find it's that perfect finishing touch
shop when you finish all your makeup and
just want to do any last little bit it's
so so
plus it has a massive mirror so I like
just to dip into these two concealer
shades and just go over any other bits
in the face I feel to me that last
little finish and that is it for my
favorite makeup this year I'm going to
put on a bit of perfume and my perfume
of choice this year there have been so
many different perfumes I've loved and I
police say my favorite overall of all
time as you probably know is a fiction
Ralph flower bomb extreme in the purple
bottle it's my number one but this year
especially for the past four months I've
say my one only and the one I have so
many compliments on and I'm not stop
wearing is this one by Armani got me a
lot of her money in this video this is
the Armani see Lipper farm there's a few
different types there is the original OD
puff farm and I think this another one
but this is leper farm and it's one with
more amber notes in it and it's just so
divine anything amber absolutely loved
those scents I'm gonna pop a bit of it
Soumya really shouldn't be spraying my
jewelry I do that every day and regret
it so with makeup out the way we need to
talk about hair I guess I'm going to
talk a bit about skincare after this as
well but hair I'm going to do my hair
now with my favorite thing so my
favorite tool of the year by far is cg8
absolutely GHD like GG varnishing this
is the GHD curling barrel I'm pretty
sure it's like a 1.5 inch curling barrel
I'll leave it listed down below where
you can get this but this has been my
hair tool of choice for the whole yet
it's anything and for when I'm curling
my hair my favourite heat protection
spray and curling spray is this by GHD
which I've used about four years now and
it's a HD curl hold spray so not only
does it heat protect it also kind of
helps to set the tails that you put in
any heat it's just like double whammy so
that's what I really like using it okay
finishing off the hair with a bit of
hairspray I'm going to use L'Oreal
studio pro boost it and it's fine it's
kind of the best hold hairspray without
weighing down the hair it isn't Christie
and you can kind of brush it out as well
the best brush is this one from tangled
teaser
I only ever used some book to use it
anyway but this one with the handle got
so mature before with the handle it's by
far my fav you with a randoms
let's Karen with hair while we're here
most of my favorite mousse is now Loreal
Elnett creme de mousse so here's the
staff about five months I think it's
incredible really great at adding so
much more volume and it's had a big
chunk this into my hair flip my hair
upside down and really work it in if you
want to know kind of more about how I do
my hair generally then I have a big
video about that that I'll try and leave
linked on the screen now got a lot of
these products in there for oil fins my
hair I love Laurie ll these
extraordinary oil it just really
nourishing it just adds a really lovely
kind of finishing layer to the ends of
the hair that to make it feel super soft
and super nourished and hydrated and not
dry to all of it in terms of shampoo if
I'm going away and I want to take one
product with me that I know will really
cleanse and clean the hair this is what
I take with me L'Oreal Alfie I've gone
through about three or four bottles of
this now love this stuff again I've done
another video on this I'll leave on the
screen but this is just really
nourishing hydrating it just really
cleanse with the hair thoroughly and
it's like a shampoo conditioner in one
super this one product and it does
absolutely everything for you so it's
just a super dream if you want to be
like super quick in the shower and get
your hair done if I'm not using that
though the product that I use at home if
I want a really good nourishing
treatment cleanse is a thin by pure
ology this is one of my favorites this
isn't a hydrate range in the purple by
also really like the turquoise color
which is his strength cure I think which
is really good for treating very damaged
hair so if my hair is feeling really bad
I use that if not I use this and it's
just really really good product this one
and the conditioner okay that's it for
hair I just got a few of the bits now I
want to talk about it's like my
favorites that really stand out this
year deodorant this is all I use the
Mitchum 48-hour flour fresh it's by far
the best children I've ever used since
using this I haven't had awful white
patches I haven't had any kind of
feeling of like oh do I smell at any
point honestly I can't recommend this
any more is so so good for tan this is
quite a difficult one but I think my
favorite time of the year has to be the
Vita Liberata phenomenal tan do a few on
this list of tons I love and they're all
very very similar but this is the one I
go back to probably
this year the phenomenal town just a
really great color for me a little bit
but if I'm tanning my face this is what
I use it's a Zen tan fresh face tan and
I find it doesn't break me out it
doesn't make my skin too dry and it adds
such a great glowing tan all out of my
face so I use it on my face and then I
use this all of my body and kind of make
sure it's all blended in around the
edges and they're kind of like my
miracle products favorite face mask of
the year has to be this one from L'Oreal
Paris this is the detoxifying one in the
black hole at me also do green and red
and the idea is you can have multi
mouths can do them in different areas
which I do and I love doing that but if
not and I'm trying to be super quick I
just put this all over this is my
favorite in the black all over and it's
just quite brightening just a really
lovely mask to put on it kind of just
dries down wipe it all away my skin just
feels a bit tighter softer cleaner so
nice in terms of eye makeup remover this
is by far my favorite I did a video with
this product which was sponsored by
Garnier and I was so happy to do it
because I'm obsessed with products
Salameh of still been using it for about
six seven months now the oil have used
cleansing water and I find it takes off
my eye makeup remover better than
anything else and it's about 399 this
whole bottle so it's literally one like
the biggest bargain products of my
entire year and favorite cleanser after
that has to be the LMS bio tech skin
energizing cleanser and a smaller of
this product it's just really soft in
the skin it makes my skin feel
SuperDuper clean and just feel like a
little bit more awake whenever I use
this to be honest I'm going to be doing
like a full skincare evening routine so
soon anyway so don't want to go into any
more skincare because my skincare
routine has got pretty huge actually
recently so I feel there's no point
really mention it now or else this video
is going to be ridiculous so I really
hope you enjoyed watching this video
