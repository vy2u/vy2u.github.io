extremely belated favourites video it's
been so long since I filmed a favorites
video last one I did was May but I also
missed April I missed like four or five
months this year I'm really really sorry
but in honesty I feel the reason may be
that around May I noticed sort of a
disinterest from a lot of you guys in
watching favorites videos analysis are
live disinterested other people's
channels as well and a lot of different
youtubers have been trying to switch up
the way they do the favorites just to
make it a little bit more fresh a bit
more new so it kind of put me off
filming them in honesty but I've
actually really been amidst it and I'm
very very excited about filming today
from now on and then we calling these
the monthly favorites and new in rather
than just favorites because there are so
many times when I get these incredible
new in products that I swatch and I'm
blown away by I absolutely love and I
want to talk about them but I've not
necessarily used them yet and they're
not necessarily a favorite but yet there
was something I was really really
excited about this month so I kind of
want to combine the two and start
bringing new favorites and new in
products in kind of a bit of a hybrid
however I have so many things to show
you in this now because it's been months
since I showed you anything that is so
much here I just need to kind of get on
with this thing right so straight up
with favorites of the month I'm kicking
this off with haircare and there's so
much hair care I could show you right
now in fact if you'd like to know how I
do my hair and get it looking like this
I'll leave the link down below to my
video I did all about my big bouncy hair
curls and waves and all the products
I've been loving are in that video but
the one I would say is my absolute
favorite out of all those it's the L net
creme de mousse volume and stronghold
mousse so I just pretty much I mean if
you watch that video you better see me
do it but pretty much just put a big
bowl at listen to my hand mix it
together through my wet hair upside down
and just really drag it through my roots
before I dry it this has so much my hold
much stronger hold so give my hair more
bounce and more root lift and just
thickens it up a little bit
so yeah I highly recommend it and these
are so affordable and they're really
brilliant next up are a lot of products
I actually bought at Canada when I was
in Vancouver starting off with the naked
skin em decay color correcting fluid and
this is the one in peach recently I've
just been finding that I'm not keen on
my under eyes and the way I've been
doing my concealer and the way it looks
every day I just find that the makeup
isn't staying on my face as well
so I went to Sephora and just binge on
so many different kind of under-eye
concealing correcting products and this
is one of the best things I've ever
picked off it's just so great it's just
like a peachy tone corrector I throw
this underneath my under eyes and a
little triangle and then just dab it in
with a real techniques sponge or a
blending sponge and it just helps to
almost cancel out over at the blueness
underneath my eyes I've got almost a
purpley blue total done to my eyes
so the peach on top of that just helps
kind of correct that color and then I've
been going in with a Kat Von D lock-it
concealer which again I found the
Sephora and was like give this a go I
got this in the shade l7 war there was
so many different shades I went through
swatching so many and this is the one
that came out with it was up the naked
skin after I've blended that all in I'll
then add big triangles of this to my
drive and again use the same sponge to
dab it all in I find this is fantastic
coverage it but not cakey it's not too
much but it's really great coverage so
this really is smitten with so that's
what we're using as well then moving
into foundation and I have to pick up
the Urban Decay all night at waterproof
long-wear liquid foundation so I've seen
all of my favorite American youtubers
and beauty gurus using this and I'm
pretty sure it's not quite out in the UK
yet so if like give it to me I've got
the shade 3 so today what I did was mix
this foundation which is now my absolute
favorite right now with another favorite
which is the hourglass this is the
hourglass vanish foundation this is in
the shade sound now this is really quite
dark actually it's the much more sort of
deeper walnut own but what I've
generally been doing when I'm sort of
not quite turned but not quite my palest
I've been almost drawing the hourglass
Foundation onto the contoured areas of
my face and then using the Urban Decay
Foundation everywhere else and then
start blending the two together it will
warm up this one tone down this one but
giving this really warm tanned beautiful
finish and I like it a lot so that's my
wearing right now you'll see in the
cutaway it's me applying getting all
that good stuff that was just this
morning when I put me down so you can
get a bit more of an idea of how it
looks it's just extremely flawless you
don't need that much either and you can
keep working in and work it in and it
just it's wonderful honestly is so
brilliant so brilliant so that is my
go-to right now powder now I'm not a
massive powder girl so many people are
like I love powder for this business and
the useless different powders I've never
really been that person until I found
this one so this is a Kat Von D lock-it
powder so I found this and I found this
and I could probably brought the
foundation as well Bob I didn't but I
did find this Oh actually and the brush
the matching brush so this is the Kat
Von D brush which kind of goes with it
so and it's so super soft I had to and
it's honestly one of the best brushes
I've ever use for the powder it's so
super soft and for this anyway so with
this I had it in my suitcase all around
Canada so pretty much all the powders
now at the top which you shouldn't be
but it is all good I'm making it work
but this is a really wonderful kind of
translucent powder and I've been using
it to bake so as I mentioned before the
whole concealer situation and I just
started thinking maybe I need to start
baking my makeup into my face better
baking the powder into the under eyes so
this day all day and seriously my under
eye makeup has never looked any better
than it has recently it's missing all
day like the other day and I did my
makeup in the morning for like a 9:00
a.m. meeting by the end of the day I got
home and it literally hadn't moved it
was he luckily same I still looked alive
and bright and and uplifted honestly
I've never had that before so I'm so
impressed so literally taking a bit of
this and I have a user brush I'm just
doing it quickly or on use a dry sponge
and pack it on leave it why do
everything else and then I'll brush it
off with this beautiful brush it's still
nice so those two together an absolute
dream come true honestly this is so good
then a new lip liner favorite is the
Kevin Kwan flesh tone lip pencil in
medium actually so this is kind of like
my lips but better and it just adds a
nudie slight brownie pink tone but
mostly kind of a nude and it's drawing
all around the lips and it's enhances my
lip shape just makes them look more full
and wonderful I mean some days I just
add this alone and it's just a very cool
toned almost Dhoni tone to this overall
it's really really great and then
there's been so many different lip
combination that I'm absolutely in love
with I must admit I mean one that you'll
probably see me sporting the most is
Anastasia Beverly Hills crush with
Anastasia Beverly Hills knock shake into
the center of it and I mix the two
together to create it's very very light
pink matte finish
so they're waves but if not the new
makeup forever lipsticks an absolute gem
these are the artists Rouge cream and I
think it's about 50 shades in this range
and I literally went through every
single shade choosing the ones I love
the most and I found a few that are my
favorites so this is C 103 which is a
great nude it's just a very flesh tone
nude maybe she liked a tiny tiny bit of
pink but mainly just a beautiful nude so
something is how little it sit where
that alone the next one up that I found
it's also gorgeous but this is a little
bit darker it C 105 you can see those
together there but both gorgeous so
quite often up let's see 105 on first
then I put C 103 soft in the middle and
blend the two together it's create a
little bit more ombre I generally don't
do my lips now without doing them all
breaks really like it oh my gosh it's
realize that I'm showing you what is
coming up next what am i doing
and also another favorite this is just
one of the super easy lipsticks to throw
on at any point suburban kisses
again it's another Beijing nude but this
is that soft sheer color it's makes your
lips look
kiss the ball and not like extremely wet
looking but shiny and pouting beautiful
it's just just one of those products it
can have any purse throw it on on the
train or whatever without a mirror and
it'll look amazing
do an easy contour favor at the moment
as well it's a Burberry face contour in
medium I just got back into needs again
they're so super simply easy joy
contours on away you want to bronze I do
it knows I'm a cheek someone jawline and
then just use kind of a pact brush I
like using me ly5 1l l y51 from Louise
Young and let's just start brushing it
in into the whole teaching solo but
anyway you want it and it just adds a
really great kind of cool toned contour
it's just kind of like contour for
dummies I feel like this is really this
is the Dior skin nude air luminizing
0:01
a champagne it's not quite rules goal
it's more of a champagne highlight it's
so stunning and again the reason I like
this is because it's just not really
shimmery it's not glittering it's just
like Colo
it's just ultra glow so when you put it
on you just glide on the skin and again
it just blends into the skin it's not
like it just looks lumpy I just find
that some highlight is because I've got
so much shimmer in them
they almost look clumpy you can tell
it's a highlighter whereas I prefer if
my skin just looks like it's glowing
from underneath because the foundation
is so good because the lights catching
my cheekbone this happens to be
glimmering that was going to look how on
and that's what this gives me it's just
super natural but brightening and
incredible so but these I'm pretty sure
I selling out like hotcakes if you want
it you might need to get to a counter
pretty soon and the last thing I've been
loving there's so many perfumes actually
but this is probably one of my absolute
favorites it's a new wire sell Mon patty
it's absolutely incredible
in fact I've got a little tiny bottle
they seal the day so I'm gonna keep that
in my purse and I've got this on today
I've been wearing it for most events
I've been going to recently I think it's
perfect it's kind of my salon my age
kind of like 25 35
range very bright it's kind of it's
sweet and it's floral and it's also a
little bit fruity it's kind of Centauri
like when you mix sweet and floral and
fruity together it's a la that is bound
to be my favorite new perfume and that's
what this is okay so I'm going to
mention new ins now for beauty that I'm
pretty obsessed with so first off Armani
have finally released our money crema
range which is less new skincare range
so new ranges can care that it's meant
to really help your makeups it's not to
one with your makeup as something that
will make it much more long-lasting and
make it work better it's just I mean I'm
a massive massive Armani beauty fan so
I've been waveless to come out ever
since I saw it what are their kind of PR
launch events back in Paris ages ago and
it's finally outs I'm pretty excited
about this so this is the smart moisture
serum that you can put onto this
moisturizer and this is a refreshing
makeup fix I can't wait to start using
them I've already kind of been watching
them and playing around a little bit and
they're absolutely beautiful I'm trying
to get I know I'll probably also get my
hands on some more pieces in the range
so when I kind of know more about which
are the best ones I will let you know
but for now keep your eye out T's are
extremely exciting
another new in and I've got an oldie and
a goodie actually I read bought this
it's a Charlotte Tilbury first love
blusher
it's my absolute favorite blusher of all
time
it's just it works in my skin tone
better than any other thing I've got it
on now which you'll see you again and
cutaways because I feel good all for you
oh yes I'm just mention it because I
dropped this about four months ago it
broke I lost it and ever since I've been
trying to go to a Charlotte tillable
makeup counter and rebuy it and can't
forgetting and a filing there's like
just by the blush just by the blush so
it's back in my collection and it's my
absolute number one ooh
next thing I'm very very excited about
you might see this on my snapchat if you
follow me I'm in the fro on snapchat if
you do quite often on there I will show
you all of my new and beauty products so
if you're ever interested then maybe
follow me there but this is a new Tom
Ford shimmer shop
this it's almost like a liquid
highlighter that I think it's got almost
a rose gold champagne kind of tones for
just watch this now so this is kind of
thing I think I'm gonna start adding
this into my moisturizer before I add
foundation or I might even start adding
it in with my foundation and it's just
gonna go oh like amazing glow and also
this would just be incredible loss of
power to the tops of the cheeks and the
very last thing that I want to mention
is the new wine cellar cushion fusion
ink cushion foundation so you open it up
go to the mirror these are all
refillable so they pop out and you can
refill them and it's got a little makeup
sponge I mean I don't often Uzis but I
do find if you want extremely high
flawless coverage then these work treat
it just packs it on and it's a slight
ultra high coverage and it opens up into
the foundation I have shade 20 here
which I think will be a really really
good shape to me actually especially
when I have not tanned so if I'm not tan
this will be a good go-to but I mean
look at it it's absolutely beautiful
that whole packaging stunning okay
that's it the Beauty lets me run
something else the ho favorite book of
the month is this one
Naomi spout Eat Smart it's pretty much
for anyone that loves a plant-based diet
you're going to find it here but it's
just wonderful literally I could look
through here and everything and see I
want to make you know sometimes you buy
a cookbook and you go through your life
now now yeah anyway oh yeah I made that
but this literally I mean look at those
chocolate coated banana Molly's
everything it just some really suits
things on like eating right now
it just really suits me against the
ground so I'm just so excited about this
I mean she looks incredible throughout
this entire thing and just I'm just so
happy far out it's just an incredible
job of in it and I think this is gonna
fly off the shelf so well done Iommi
it's incredible
also I'm gonna mention these rings I
can't stop wearing these now these are
my beautiful friend Suzy hello October
if you don't already follow her her
collection with Missouri which is a

collaborated with Missouri on this line

been Wireless beautiful rose gold worn
on my index finger nothing the one I've
been wearing the silvers they're just
absolutely beautiful they're so dainty

jewelry 20 I prefer much smaller

jewelry and it seeks me wonderfully so
I'll leave links of course down below
and for everything else the links will
be down below as always and the last
kind of thing before I get onto fashion
the last thing I want to mention as well
favorite thing that I did so I'm at the
face of blogosphere for I don't know

incredible this is a self-portrait dress

magazine coming
actually it's so pretty it's just a
really easy one to wear it's lovely cut
out the lace and mesh and again into the
back so I didn't wear a bra with it it
just doesn't kind of ruin the whole
effect I thought I'd mention it and the
last piece you'll have seen in a recent
8 oz hole but it's kind of one of my
favorite things I've fought in a while
it's just a very easy Bardot top in
white with these cooked hem through all
