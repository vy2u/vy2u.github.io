Thursday morning and I am out bright and
early for a 9 a.m. meeting with Ted
bacon this morning I'm meeting up with
my manager and Ted Baker and we're gonna
have a lovely chat a lovely lovely chat
yeah I'll be honest I'm feeling a little
sleepy after that trip and a lot of
early mornings and things so I really
did I'm looking forward to maybe an
early night later already more looking
forward to my early night hey guys back
at my desk
alex is hard at work we've had a few
little parcel moments today that I
thought I'd quickly show you first up is
my new copper clothing rail how nice is
this clothing real girls so lovely so
this is from a store called little deer
I know means this brand actually for
years and they've just started selling
these like customized they make these
themselves three of them and I made them
themselves
you can have them like cut down and
customize if you want if you want them a
shorter so I've got so this here is 85
centimeters across and it's pretty much
almost like five seven it's almost yeah
it's about the same same height as me as
assessment and in fact by the time you
see the fuel have already seen the video
so I bought this to start a new series
that I'm doing called the style remix
which I'm gonna be doing every single
month and I kind of want it just a rail
next to me that could put different
hangers and clothes on so I could start
properly talking through things and
they're much more professional way I
guess so and then Jim sharp has sent me
some new new leggings and tops and bras
and let me quickly just show you a few
bit cuz I really liked my raspberry
colored one I've gone for the dark grey
with the peach banding bra the matching
leggings got your old bump off the bum
sculpt it I think I think these are
brand new the peachy colored bra tops
again which will also look awesome with
these if I can mix and match sure sorry
with with the trans will fill up cool
together so might wear those today we're
about to go to the gym in a minute
and so say I'm not been through few days
I'm excited this is very cute just a
little tank white cropped but sold a
soft cover up the bail a little bit
which I want on days women just feel a
lot bit bloated seem to get rid of the
gym back from the gym oh gosh my legs
are like quivering cuz they're so tired
oh yeah I had a really good workout so
did Alex or both in the swing of it now
are we bad yeah well they don't know
they'll have to go along to my Instagram
to find out oh no no no but on my
Instagram I've written where I'm going
next after let's go check out my
Instagram what you guys in the throw
plug I'm gonna take a whole makeup as
well because it's I've had it on from
all day so I'm gonna do that and then I
want to also unpack my back not
literally this is just in the middle of
the floor in the middle of the lounge so
I need to do that hi guys good morning
it's Friday today and I've been so
excited about today so I am in half
annex right now I'm in the light salon
skin rejuvenation bar with a Lumiere MD
has so much about that and today it's
try out their products and first time
ever so I've just been chatting with
Victoria who is the clinical specialist
here obviously you guys know I've been
talking about how bad my skin has been
recently and how it's been like super
sore and sensitive and textured so I've
come in today does it sort of talk about
what we can do to kind of help my skin
so I'm going to start by cleansing your
skin and then going to use some very
mild acid
superficial oils and then I'm going to
use very specific facial Diagnostics to
analyze our skin and I'm going to build
a hyper customized treatment based on
the performance of your skin today and
now you think okay I cannot wait so
we've got purified gel cleanser bouncing
solution deep moisture mask which sounds
wonderful recovery balm sheer hydration
broad-spectrum Sun cream SPF 40 and
didn't you say it's completely clean in
science you say we refer to it as clean
science and clean formulations so every
single ingredient that's in these
products feeds and nourishes your skin
there's nothing harmful in there Wow
I'm just in the middle of my peel so
right now Victoria had that 30% lactic
acid peel on the lactic acid is an
anchor chain so it's going to snip
through the keratin bonds that are like
velcro keeping dead skin cells attached
to the surfaces
so this is going to have an exfoliating
action and it's going to remove any
superficial dead skin that could lead to
any kind of dryness or a dull appearance
after this peeler she's going to feel
light and bright and we've just power on
the moisture mat in the sand so it's
kind of like a GL product it's got
sunscreen in there that's going to
protect my skin all day and then it also
has these little beads and sign it that
bursts and create the color and the
pigment and if this makes you look on
tinted beautiful and I've got the color
found so you've got the full green in
there and also like a foundation like a
tinted kind of moisturizing hydrating
foundation so it's the radiance oh my
god guys are converted I'm gonna keep
you up to date with how this goes again
I'm really excited about up a selfie
making editors and journalists about
this get karey so I will let you know
okay guys back from my face shot you may
see that this is a bit different behind
me I mean I'm just setting up right now

quite simple concept it's just me

a lot of you guys will have in your
wardrobe already mixing it with a few
items that I've got that month which is

the next thing
we just arrived at a hotel the wild
rabbit
Dilek I mean look at the houses around
here literally is like something out at
the holiday so quaint we just finished
up meditation as well which was really
really fantastic and it was really
trying to focus my mind fully and it was
quite difficult at all to really really
trying my best but a key problem that I
want to try again
oh my gosh she's late for dinner so cute
yeah I'm going to continue to try to do
some more meditation in the future
because I want to be good at that I feel
like it'll be really good for me oh my
goodness I have saved some nice rooms
but this is absolutely gorgeous this bed
all to myself
I'm so sorry this is it almost feels
like twice the size of my bed at home so
this is the bedroom a little entryway I
mean I could just watch you have a
little family in here and check that out
and then to the bathroom so now I really
really want a bath because it's just
gorgeous I look at a lot of the state
okay you better get ready chilling just
editing up my Instagram picture and now
I'm gonna run I'm gonna run it back
because why hell not When in Rome right
I've had my bath I am ready to go out
again
very very quick makeup do just wear my
bum and jump it with my algorri back and
just mic my leather trousers and do your
shoes with a very simple black with gold
look how cute this little romantic meal
is this is amazing so this is like a
separate barn just oh sorry babies
hopefully just over there is the
restaurant you can say but this is like
a separate bar and it's super special
and we have in Buster mine
passion fruit soufflé mmm okay back from
that absolutely delicious delicious meal
the lovely ladies from Vista got us all
these beautiful scarves customized piss
lives no pleasing so these are from
Holland concur
absolutely gorgeous what a lovely gift
so it's now half ten I actually need to
wash my hair I need to turn and I need
to do email so I'm gonna do it in that
order
get in bed do my emails until until
they're all done good morning guys I'm
just finishing up getting ready I
thought I'd say hey who are they
L'Oreal sublime town open up to elixir
no nice and glowy
I put on my face as well so we needed
something I love putting mascara on my
lashes when they've been fully le old I
fully burned did I say that the other
day you know I don't think it took you
with me
the other day I wouldn't got my lashes
done again it's what they're looking
quite nice and curly again I don't
really need to use the eyelash curlers
but I just really want them to be even
more lifted but because they have the
treatment they will hold now without the
treatment these would not hold on I said
fall how I've done this have got ready
in 15 minutes
yeah so the idea with this retreat is to
show people that you can come to vista
village to go shopping you could also
make more of a trip of it like this
hotel is probably 35 40 minutes drive
from Vista so if you're in a car on
you're driven to Vista you could also
come here and stay over you could go to
the bank for spa which is like five
minutes away you can go for a gorgeous
lunch at the bone foot spa farmhouse
because I want to say yesterday was
absolutely divine there's just a lot
more to do than just go to the certain
shop you can do those other stuff which
is really opened my eyes to it now and
actually I'm thinking how nice it would
be to organize this for my mom Nina mum
come along take it to the spa for
Mother's Day for mo don't think you can
go to Vista for the day and do some
shopping then we could maybe like eat a
mister come here to stay over the night
telleth beyond incredible and the day
after go to Daylesford farmhouse for
lunch and also go to spa and a spa
treatments and say that's the day I can
eyes with that day when every uses tax
yeah stuff always minded coach so she'll
be like okay okay how can you see my
 she's so cute
lip magnet is in my favorite shade is
the lightest nudey pink thyroid such a
good everyday everyday pink color a
little pony here right guys we headed
off from the hotel and we're now a
desert yeah this place is just the
absolute dream I wish I lived near here
I would come here every day we're about
to do a cooking class just few people I
know we this would be - yeah it's doing
so well here with our fish I want to get
one of these in my kitchen this is so
great
rosemary is that time okay not messing
with the tone not lifting your knife or
too much and because I got my hand here

celery I can close my eyes okay so now
