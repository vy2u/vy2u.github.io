day seven seven I think it's Monday
morning I have just what time is it now
I think it's about half eleven ten past
eleven and we've had quite a lot of
parcels today so I thought maybe I'd
show you I'm going away next week skiing
as I've mentioned on actually Friday and
I wanted to get loads of base layers so
sweaty Betty has sent me some incredible
snow gear man who knew that's what you
bet she did
snow gear until now I didn't realize
this is amazing so I've got this really
cool snow top it's like an under layer
with matching leggings to go with them
pretty sure that Carly Rowena has the
same so we're getting a matching matchy
20s gorgeous headband to go around my
little spot I've got some these these
look literally we need these riceland
these are merino wool
leggins these will be so warm so if
anyone is wanting to go to ice and so
many of you have been loving my blog
posts and instagrams about Iceland and
so many of you been saying that you want
to go see if you want to go I would
honestly recommend getting some flats
like merino wool leggings that can go
into your jeans this is what you really
need like under one delay it's like that
one
indoors and then also I've got a buff as
well it's not a buff if it's not it well
if it's a brand name I just keep on a
buff what is that what's the word for
that when you call something by brand
name I love that word as well so I've
got this woollen ski neck warmer it's a
neck one that's absolutely amazing thank
you so much a sweaty Betty I'm going to
be still warm

Clarins they sent me their new

things that they've got from you

receptors and some ombre these cream
eyeshadows down here I love working

oh and else their homes dollars are
bringing out their new Pro palates know
like how Mac do that palates and you can
fill them up in one of these so I've
just been on the website buying things
to go inside that palate so again that
should be really good for tutorials and
things and finally I've got the most
insane gifts from GHD because they knew
that I was desperate to try out this
curler since the Arctic Gold curve gifts
