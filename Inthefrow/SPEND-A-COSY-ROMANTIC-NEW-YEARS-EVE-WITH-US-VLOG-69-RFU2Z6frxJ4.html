vlogs I am hopefully going to get back
in the swing of this again so it's a few
days before at the end of the year
actually now I'm just going to get my
nails done not looking very good I had
them painted black for photoshoot but
quite light touch they never had black
nails for quite liked it I think I might
go for something a bit more sparkly and
fun desperately near your turn
I know I'm very very pale hunts
embracing my paleness I'm gonna go to
dry by and then we're going to hold food
so it's just quite nice nice day it's
absolutely freezing
we got home yesterday from from Wigan
the whole house was freezing cold socks
it was out four days worth of no having
no heating on so at the fabric of the
house it just really really got cold so
even left the heating on overnight just
trying to heat everything up it's it's
quite nice and toasty now I'm gonna go
get my nails done and then I'm gonna go
to Oldfield he's gonna play his new
Nintendo he loves it
I'm all done so I've come for I've come
for Red Baron s on my toenails
sorry about the toes and then this is a
brand new sandy color it's cold
married to move let me Siffin get really
good oh there we go sorry to move such a
gorgeous color very like classic
sophisticated very grey brown Mo's hi
babe yeah gay I spotted you over there I
made it to Whole Foods and Alex was
already here waiting for me
today and this is almost like a bit of a
whistle-stop vlog think of parts of the
days I'm either remembering to vlog or
bothering to because to be honest it's
all very like boring we're in kind of
limbo land at the moment between
Christmas and New Year as everyone
else's so it's just bad like catching up
on work completing deadlines and lots of
Alex playing his guitar took care of our
country music I've just written off and
put and I'm going to be posting soon a
brand new post running blog post and
with lots of different swatches of the
new Armani XD shine lip six really proud
of that looks really really nice so who
you like that I'll leave it linked on
the screen whichever side that is pretty
much all we did here so don't forget you
it's all we did so I didn't love it but
today we're going to shoot him thought
I'd say hi I'm just wearing my TLM top
the lean returns and my red set from Jim
shark I know it looks like a puppet
makeup on up just brushed up my eyebrows
at the Tom Ford brow gel I'm obsessed
with it the five a brow gel and I've
rediscovered it recently and it's so
brilliant it just keeps them in place
just adds a bit more color and also adds
the fibers in so it sickens them up I've
just put on some glossy a thebomb.com
with a little bit of lip magnate from
Armani cuz I had at my desk that put a
move this on and I've put I've just put
some moisturizer I put serum on I put
oil on and I've also put tiny bit of the
loom the RMS luminaries rails my cheat
buzz just so you know I get that little
we go home without fit actually that's
all I've done that's gonna get for gem
then after that really was gonna cook
we're gonna make a soup we're gonna
chill do these deadlines get some bits
on the way oh yeah and just enjoy these
days off without an emails pretty much
I'm loving it wearing this to the gym
just to protect my little ears I thought
we could show you this really cool box
that I got I think um I think sweaty
Betty sends me this actually but so it's
a little sweaty Betty bag and then the
idea is it's like a gym bag like a
little mini pouch bag and at first I was
like I'm gonna
and I thought yeah this is actually
brilliant because quite often when I go
the gym I'm doing so many things I have
so many things with me and then I always
forget one and leave one of the machines
so I've got a little tissue because of
the moment my nose won't stop running
which is not different to usual I've got
a workout resistance band I've got my
gloves in here from doing any deadlifts
I've also got a towel and I've got my
beats so you know that's five things in
there I'll also put my phone in here
when I get there
you know so it just keeps it super
simple and I just all then have to do is
carry around this bag I've got a
deliciously alibagh from the walk home
and I've also got so many other
resistance bands on here depending on
what I'm doing as well and an umbrella
just in case I'm caught short so hi guys
now it's New Years Eve I didn't do
anything yesterday did I I said
yesterday sorry about the kind of lack
of vlogs I'm just chilling my few days
off and so I'm just gonna showing you a
little bits and bobs weren't for gym
yesterday my whole body is sore today I
was doing deadlifts with a 30 bar which
is an overly massive but for my tiny
little arms it's pretty big but someone
outside the 25 bar so I just got the 13
now my shoulders are rare paying for it
I've just been tidying up my closet
I mean I've still got a little bit to go
here but everything was everywhere and I
got some new suitcases
as you saw so I had to make room for
them and sort things out and things so
that's been taking me a little while
it's nasty this is what I'm this is when
I'm clean enough pen no bra obviously
because he's got time for bras so that's
what I've been doing he's gonna carry on
with fat I'm gonna clean the whole house
just a nightmare not so having a cute
little knee is Eve in the house we don't
really like New Year's Eve so we don't
want to make a big deal of it so it's
gonna have a nice little romantic night
together aren't we yeah we're gonna
watch the Star Wars trilogy aren't we
the originals yeah the original three
I'm gonna watch those gonna have some
champers I'm making fudge so I'll show
you that later
yeah so it should be quite a nice day
today I'm quite looking forward to Chile
and all that and also I just thought I'm
going to do all the rest of my emails
today so that everything that I've got
in 2017 is done and I can move on with
my next year perhaps came about two
weeks ago and it said don't open until
today oh it's from Victor Ralph what is
it
pinata oh my gosh look it's a victim
Ralph pinata in that I have a batter it
will explode do not pull this in it you
joke in your pretty that is
oh my god be careful that you yeah in it
I don't know that's what I would think
it was well then why else would come
with a snake that's so great
the flat is so clean so clean I mean
acts have been on a cleaning binge today
we've also just set off my brand new
lighting yes five years I had my old
life five years and they were so done
with so we've got these cool LED panels
I'll leave them a link down below
they're a bit more expensive than my
other ones which was 70 quid but again I
had the five years which is a bit insane
no one does so old but these ones look
bit more expensive but are so much
better quality still in my cozy cozies
apart from I've got socks on now
excellent I've spent like an hour and a
half before on the phone to my best mate
which was nice I look like a crazy lady
at this point though Oh me night centre
net pout in a minute I mean it's gonna
be out in a minute and get some food for
dinner aren't we yeah what we're making
Alex's cooking was a Thai broth a
lemongrass Thai broth
sure I'm gonna wing this thing I think
it was I think it'd be great usually
make this amazing lemongrass Thai like
stir-fry so I thought I felt a little
bit more water to it you know a bit more
kind of like bok choy maybe things that
make it into more of a broth with rice
noodles and the veg still I'm trying to
copy the yes I well from Wagga Mama's
it's something like that but not spicy
because somebody can't find all that
stuff yeah I don't want this - mm-hmm
I'm making coconut goji berry fudge
which I saw I love goes eat berries very
much I found it in this book this book
that my mum got myth Christmas and
adjourns my way to cook mmm I love this
bag so much I'm so glad I took the
plunge and it was still 30% off at least
which is pretty good but it lets make
such a gorgeous spring back and was
obsessed with the colors we've been out
we've bought lots of things I am now
going to make my coconut and goji fudge
guys it's a fully raw meal as well so I
don't even have to cook it hopefully
this will be super delicious and really
quite good for you as well because but
not goji's coconut honey vanilla so it
should be pretty good actually and it's
also fully fully blunt base which is
nice so now let's go okay I'm working
away on my coconut goji fudge bites and
this is kind of defeating me a little
bit
I feel first up she asks me to blend
everything into a fine powder but then
part of ingredients within that lemon
zest which is somewhat wet then I have
to make a powder out something that's
wet so it's all kind of clumping up in
at all so that's the first thing that's
hard work but to go and get my food
processor at processor out-thought the
nutribullet would work so I could get my
mojo mix so now I'm left with this big
like gunk of stuff enough to pop my
other things and so hopefully after
these are our mix then it'll be even
better I don't know
let's try this time
this is where we got and I just put in
some vegan vegan junk chips because I
was like I want to gonna spice this up a
little bit so I don't know how I'm gonna
be but I just had a taste and it's super
rich and like honey so they're
definitely fudgy okay who you are I I'm
hoping it tastes better than it looks I
mean doesn't look too bad when it's
quitting two little squares it should be
okay cleaned all the kitchen
kitchens ready I'm honing amaretto and
tonic water the thing is my dessert is
ready at all its up is Alex and his tie
bro excited so I'm gonna sit here I'm
gonna do my email okay I've done my
emails all of my emails I don't put 2017
out the way done and dusted it's very
very yellow much better oh I'm very red
just had a shower got myself a little
bit more fresh although I'm still in my
NASA t-shirt but kids learning Jillian
from evening has been cooking for hours
he's doing his Thai broth from scratch
so it's taken him hours
I've done all my emails I'm showered and
pampered in that time and now I'm just
gonna cheat you
hell yeah oh this is about to see you
like a Chippendale how oh my god this
looks amazing
well hello welcome to where manners we
have one mission one dish only I hope
you like it oh you definitely definitely
got drunk again have you I drink so much
I'm joking I've always end up watching
the office drinking bourbon I don't mind
as long as things are made I think my
dinner is murd and then I've got my
fudge for afters okay I don't know yeah
I know it is it's a bit a bit gooey hey
my fudge ha ha ha well it's all kicking
off now we have a gorgeous bottle of
champagne runa don't know I'm pretty
sure that Cheryl accout sent
of this and it's been in the fridge
waiting for a good occasion so kicking
off the night with this now I feel
you're gonna fire it my god
look at this you have serious as I count
on you fluffy baby this is insane
Happy New Year babe to an amazing 2018
after an incredible 2017 that's right w
balls on Alex's meal was absolutely
insane
but let me know post allis-chalmers
possible pause pause bun
Alex's meal was the best broth I've ever
ever ever eaten much laters we have
booths literally picked up the balls and
drank the soup because it was that tasty
I all my feelings or wagga mama's and
give them the recipe for that because
they serve that why my mama's my god I
would go every single day the issue is
that it took Alex two and a half hours
to make
so the Johnson was having that a lot a
very very slim plate delicious and then
we've just had my hi my fudge my
addition to this evening and it haven't
really set so we've pretty much just a
big goop it's like a goop I am still
quite I taste it to affair it's really
nice
corny got lovely aftertaste now that
honey and lemon goes you berries it's
that so we're gonna continue with that
champagne and watch Star Wars and just
get comfy we've got like throws in our
comfy cushions I'm just gonna get cozy
the rest of the night
