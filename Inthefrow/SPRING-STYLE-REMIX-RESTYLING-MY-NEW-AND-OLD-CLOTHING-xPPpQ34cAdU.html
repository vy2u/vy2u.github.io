finally a new style remix I film the
first one in January and the first gonna
make it into like a series I mean
obviously I've kind of run out of time
over the past few months to get this
together so instead I thought I would
start making these style remixes
seasonal so this is gonna be the spring
style remix if I can fit any in in
between I will do otherwise are gonna be
spring autumn winter and then summer as
well so hope you like them just as much
let's get into it yeah my dear with the
style remix is that rather than going
out buying a whole new wardrobe
each season it's all about mixing in
last season and the season before items
shoes accessories jackets etc in with
brand new things in your wardrobe I mean
we're all constantly buying the odd
little thing to put into our wardrobe so
this is just away picks and things
together and creating a slightly
different outfit so what I've done is I
went into our wardrobe spent ages it
took me ages it's actually really good
for me as well because I needed some new
inspiration as to what to wear so this
is really really good for me so time
it's taken me to put this together it's
actually super worthwhile well one thing
absolutely love from left season here is
this dress from Rick so I wore this in
for New York Fashion Week in February so
I kind of felt it was quite a wind chill
proofread dress especially if you wear
it with the right kind of shoes a jacket
with it being a darker color it kind of
insinuate that it's off wintery guides
but I absolutely love it I love to
quarter fit I love the silhouette I love
the way it makes me feel whenever I wear
it so I've pulled this back out I stand
up with my little Chanel wallet on Shane
just to throw a few things into and I
really liked it with the colors in this
because got so many different water
colors going through it
now the new piece I added on to that if
you ever see tags him up in my clothes I
am wearing them I just cannot be
bothered shape tags out this I thought
worked really nicely over the dress the
little spots of orange and red that you
can see going through the stress this
kind of pulls those out as a pop of
color and I think this really kind of
makes this dress more casual because it
could be dressed up with a pair of heels
look a lot more kind of glamorous with
the right makeup and then
just makes it look so much more casual
for a spring day so big big big fan of
this I think it's gorgeous color and
when it comes to shoes I delved back
into my wardrobe again trying to find
something that haven't worn in a while
and again I wanted to transition more
into spring and I found these huge fan
of shelving Taurasi a lot of you know if
you're G's these they kind of do all
year round and lots of different colors
they do the most gorgeous beige eat and
shade the dark charcoal gray but still I
think you can wear these okay the
computer spontaneous this I play music
anyway back to pace yeah I thought these
looked amazing with this dress I think I
wore them with this dress last season
and I thought pull them out again so it
makes such a cute little outfit next up
this pair of trousers from Burberry I
just didn't realize how much I would
actually wear these and I've worn them
so much honestly so many times I have
worn these trousers so actually I'm
super glad I feel like they're a really
worthwhile investment and I've had men
and women both compliment me on these
and say that they want them so it's
pretty good feedback if guys like did
they do men's ones of these cuz they're
so cool yeah absolutely love them
they're really flattering on they make
my bum look super nice and peachy they
don't seem to stretch much either which
is great so every time I put them on if
they feel like brand-new again but I
guess it's part of the quality of a pair
of every trousers I love the length of
them I just think they're a great
trouser so I wanted to make sure I kept
on wearing them for this season this is
a super easy outfit but just threw on
with a new white t-shirt got from A&amp;amp;M
it's just a little cuter and more
feminine with these very cute frilly
sleeves otherwise I like the fact that
this is more textured white tee it's
kind of like mole vibes throughout the
fabric but tucked into these trousers
the trousers to all the talkin it's just
a little white tee on the top so put
that with it now the bag I had two
options first one being the chiffon she
had to go now there are slight balloons
running through the Burberry trousers so
I thought I wanted to pull out that blue
and pair it with
red and for anyone isn't too sure I then
switched over just to a white super easy
little Chanel flat bag
really really easy lovely bag I've worn
that so many times I've got a lot of use
out of it if you are thinking of
investing in one of these I think it's
just the perfect size it's absolutely
beautiful can't say any more it's great
back and I think one of the best things
about this outfit are the boots and
they're my Balenciaga knife boots I
think I've worn these now more this
season than I did the season I even
bought them and I must admit I kind of
feel like these are everywhere now
although they weren't like a last season
piece so I don't know I feel everyone
kind of bought them wasn't sure and then
now they've fallen in love with them I'm
a big fan I wore these a lot with this
Rick so dress and they look super cool
but I've been wearing these with the
Burberry trousers so it's like red on
red it's a very bold look but I'm really
really into it I've had a lot of
compliments whenever I wear it it's just
such a strong look I mean these go with
so many things and a huge fan a very
cool pair of boots okay next up I wanted
to make more use of this bar Monte I
love it I think it's so cute I wore it
for Paris Fashion Week with a whole bow
man outfit it was just the perfect kind
of choice for the outfit and I mean
sometimes I'm not the one for slogans
and there's a few slogans currently in
my wardrobe and it's very different for
me so I'm not usually one for such brush
logos but the fact that it's like gold
foil I think makes it a little more
subtle so I pulled this out and this I
bought the other day from Topshop it's
brand new I was a big fan of this as
soon as I saw it I love the mixture of
the vertical and horizontal stripes
they're very asymmetric hem line it's
couldn't like a hankerchief style at the
bottom it's just very cool with these
tortoiseshell buttons on the side as
well as a little extra detail so the
gold of the bell man worked really well
with this golden orange sunburst
color however of you may see in the
cutaways it's quite see-through I didn't
realize just how see-through this out so
it was it's quite see-through so you
could see the white at the top just
cutting through there so what I would
suggest is I just played around with the
shades is dead and went for a black body
instead of it being v-neck or anything
I came off a square boxy neck really
really liked it and also the fact that
it's a body
everything is just pulled in you don't
get any ruffles you won't have any
fabric riding up which always annoys me
I like how versatile the skirt is to
come out white or you can wear black
with it it looks really cool either way
with that I also added a provenza
Schouler clutch bag these also come with
a strap you can bind them with a strap
if you would prefer this almost looks
like a crystal and this looks like a
rock that's been all like shaped from
really cool little bag but I just
thought this makes it a little bit more
kind of evening appropriate you could
throw on some heels of this and give
more of a nighttime look but in terms of
shoes for this I wore my brand new do
flats I am obsessed with these I bought
them maybe four days ago and I have worn
them every single day
I'm huge fan of these now I don't I mean
I don't wear flats very much guys and he
goes so great they're so comfortable I
was worried that they would need to come
off my feet because he litters in the
toe and it's color on the back but
actually it gives you so much more
support than I realized
and if you tie this to the door bow it
doesn't come undone so actually they are
amazing obviously their deal prices but
and know I'm gonna get so much wear out
of these although for the rest of summer
so these are great okay fourth outfit
the piece I really wanted to bring down
again
was this skirt I've got so many views
now I wear this skirt so often so I find
it so versatile I can wear it with
anything at all this neutral shades
which to go to any other color I went
with my new hoodie so it's so if you if
you watch my next port a haul you will
have seen this in that I wasn't sure if
I was gonna keep it for a little while
and then I tried on it was like to know
what I don't have any hoodies I don't
have anything I can just chillin in the
house that I can throw on if I walk into
the gym I can throw a knife I'm just
going to see my managers or seeing a
friend or go into a friend's house you
know there's so many things where I want
to dress down and I don't have anything
that's really that appropriate so it's
not you know what I'm just going to keep
it and I actually really really like it
so I've actually been wearing this quite
a lot with different outfits so with
that and I wanted to wear something a
little bit more edgy so I went for these
white boots from Kurt Geiger I believe
no guy a car fella these are very much
like an Alexander one do not super
comfortable I think they're a great pair
boo
white boots are massive this season so
the super great again you could wear
flats with this very easily so I've also
surely awareness outfit with an old pair
of good Eve my nickel if Kurt cord the
kinda like Jeannie samples I have two
pairs of these I bought them maybe three
and a half years ago now I think I've
had them that long in my wardrobe and
I'm the biggest fan with the beige tone
of a skirt these worked really really
nicely and then through bag I brought
out this hoodie out with a pile my LV
lock back oh my gosh I think it's like
the LV lock lb lock bag lock it back no
I could not remember the name of this
bag I find with this strap it's got more
of a casual vibe it's not overly elegant
I don't think that's why I like to wear
it in more of a casual setting okay guys
so in this video I thought I'd give you
five outfits it wasn't meant to be for
this hour remixes but I got a little bit
inspired and did a little bit more and
also my next video because I have so
many outfits I wanted to show you my
next video will be about another five
spring outfits as well not necessarily
mixing them in with my old things but a
few newer things and new outfits so
that's coming up - I just had to split
them into two because I had too many
outfits I got very inspired so thank you
for inspiring me this outfit worked
around an oldie that is kind of brand
new again for the season white jeans
I've been seeing white jeans I loathe my
Pheebs I kind of feel like they are back
with a vengeance and these jeans I
probably bought these like a year if not
longer ago white jeans are always a
great spring/summer
vibe sometimes it gets a little bit warm
to wear jeans if you get a more
lightweight fabric that's not too thick
it's a little easier to wear them
especially if you were in like a cami on
top I mean these would look great with
this little top I'm wearing now you'll
see this one in my next video I wanted
to pair this with something a little new
so I mean part of me really wanted to
put this with like a white tee but it's
like that's so much right so said I went
for black instead and I've just bought
this bodysuit another bodysuit I could
quite easily a form that all the black
one I showed you this is just an
alternative this one is v-neck it's also
ribbed
I do love rib fabrics anything that adds
a bit of texture to your fabric and
all about that so I just paired it with
a really easy v-neck body again the fact
it's a body means it's not gonna be
rounding up our future houses everything
looks very sleek I'm very put together
so so super easy want to wear so black
and white very monochrome until I added
this I got literally got this this
morning I ordered it last night from a
South this is absolutely beautiful
the kimono trend is huge this season
especially for festivals you're gonna
see a hell of a lot of kimonos and
whether that's a kimono in this long
traditional kind of kimono style or
literalist kimono sleeves on a lot of
jackets and tops you'll see a lot of
that I wanted to kind of bring this in
to show you a way you could style up a
kimono in a much more casual setting
that isn't festival vibes it's a little
more expensive I think it's about 100
pound mark but it's really beautiful
fabric it's got these gorgeous
embellishments
sequins on it this is a little bit more
going on to this in your average kimono
for the shoes another newbie into my
wardrobe these beautiful aqua Zara
sandals I took these to India with me
because they either called like the
Indian moon some dill sauce a little bit
inspired to get them back I'm probably
gonna be blind to me right now because
these will literally catch the light so
amazingly but again it's added a little
touch more light and brightness and I've
been more texture to the whole outfit
and that's the final accessory my Gucci
Marmont bag this has been everywhere it
went out stock came back in stock so
many people have this bag and I think
it's just such a goodie
so I've completely lost my voice yeah
and they're gonna just kind of added a
little bit more color to this outfit and
it just worked really well with the
greens that were in the kimono as well
okay that's it five new remixed outfits
which was your favorite let me know down
below I am so excited to start wearing
these outfits so I really hope you like
them too guys everything I have
mentioned if it's still in stark most of
it I think will be I'm leave it down
