don't have any eye makeup on right now
because I'm about to go and get a lush
lift a few showing placements co-op I'll
I'll flog it within there
but I'm getting a lash lift so pretty
much I think it's where they add loads
of a treatment to your eyelashes to make
them really light lift up it sounds like
a pearl ash pan so I'm excited it's
going to get that then get back here get
some dinner and then we're nicely onto
Star Wars premiere later so that's the
order of the day I am gonna go now
because I'm really really late so he's
come to the caring vets clinic which is
just on High Street it's really lovely I
love this candle I hope this comes ahead
yes so just getting my lashes lifted
here hi guys and some back home now I
went out for my lash lift I don't know
if you want to see as much I have
extremely stubborn lashes so lash lift
didn't work on me anywhere near as well
as it could have done but there's still
more cold than they were so if you saw
saw before my lashes sort of pointed
almost down and straight or as now
they've got can a very loose curl to
them and they're tinted as well so you
know they're quite cute so later that
did them was like I'd love to have seen
a large and lift and what we'll have to
do is if you come back in four weeks
we'll put the smaller so she was a
medium lift and she said we'll put the
smaller pads on to curl them which means
you'll get a much tire lift she said
that hopefully that will work with
having this and then having that on the
top so yeah you can just about see that
they're lifted you're not meant to get
them wet to anything and I've just been
having a cry not if it's becoming to
limit hormonal but just have some really
really bad knee is this week and it's
just really really got me down
I'm just feeling really really emotional
like constantly I like this on to battle
with me in between sort of having a
little fits and best of crying
something's happened and yeah this be
upset about it so I'm just making me not
some sweeps I'm just having my usual
broccoli that's how I missed Roni we've
just had a big shot arrive so I'm so
happy that I've managed to get sori in
banana loaf who else loves this it's my
favorite it's nothing better on it you
can barely buy anywhere so I got one
Waitrose so the fridge is nicely stocked
now full of loads of veg and bit I've
got loads of meats and whatnot I also
wanted some Muscat it's my favorite
dessert wine and they gave me orange
Muscat and flora so God knows what that
is that hopefully it's nice that
probably you might have a afternoon tea
poker the way I'm feeling really really
down oh yeah these blushes by the way
are Nouveau lashes and they do loads
different treatments like eyelash
extensions what they do this is called
the l VL lvl rush lift so if you off
someone was kind of quite care the
lashes are quite thin and last year
subdued we can do a lot with then this
would work so well for you because
usually can get such a massive lift to
them but I have quite thick and very
very spirit lashes so they didn't react
to the treatment as well Richard no so I
had didn't have a patch test before I
went in so I had to have a scratch test
so I had to have a needle scratch down
the back of my neck and the dives put
inside it does check I didn't react to
it I mean it doesn't really hurt it just
felt like a little scratch so I smell
scratch knew I had to have that done so
it's just yeah just annoying that
they're not more open but they're still
a lot better than they would be usually
I just need to stop crying or else
they're not going to be any good
tomorrow gonna make myself a hot
chocolate which
shall I use my go for Vegas got these
thanks for the perfume shop that means a
little gifts with Mushmouth and multi
smoke drink and small endorse I'm gonna
smash it all together stick it in an
espresso machine with some milk George
