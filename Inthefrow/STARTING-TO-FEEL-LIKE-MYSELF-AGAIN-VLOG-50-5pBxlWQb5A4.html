hi guys welcome to Tuesday morning today
is actually gonna be such a lovely chill
day I think I've got a lot of work on
I've got a big deadline for tonight that
I'm trying to finish off we just have
one thing on the agenda today we've got
a lovely lady coming round from Olympus
who's gonna just show us how to use one
of the really cool new tracker cameras
it's called the TG tracker it's part of
the Tough Series it's like an action
camera something that you would compare
to me like a GoPro and but it has this
really cool software inside it where it
tracks things like velocity how fast
you're moving where you are so safe
you're in like a plane and you're going
up and down whatever it would kind of
track it's just it sounds very very cool
temperature it's also got a light on it
on the front so safety underwater it has
like a little light yeah it does looks
amazing but it's such a cool dynamic
camera that we want to kind of learn a
bit more about it for an upcoming trip
that were doing - can't tell you too
much about yet but it's coming up
probably on the next vlogs and I can't
wait to tell you all about it so just
coming over to show us that really soon
actually in the next ten minutes and
then after she's gone home it's gonna do
a full day of working we've just been
cleaning up the house obviously when we
have guests we like to make sure the
place is clean and tidy but it's also a
good excuse to actually get the place
looking awesome
so we've just been tidying getting
ourselves ready I've actually put some
clothes on which is great as a step
forward yeah I mean when you've got
deadlines needs trying to work and work
and work and work sometimes I find
better just to stay in bed in my pajamas
and don't think about anything but the
foot typing save me cookies now ladies
I'd like to cookies we told them how
many cookies oh my god I don't know if
you guys follow me on Twitter but it got
serious that we can read about I think
you may want to eat today about a cup I
had one you didn't just have one no no
no no no no don't no yes yes yes yes you
had a hug - laughs - and you kept eating
my other house yeah it was so like so
delicious boondi maybe you could put
brownie a biscuit in a cake in front of
me and I would probably choose to this I
put peanut butter in them they were like
gluten-free wheat free it's like a cake
cookie mix and oh he almost I think he
overdid them a little bit in the oven
but it made them really crispy and I
really not know
it was really crispy although delicious
I couldn't stop eating on good I know
and today I'm wearing this cute little
jumper which is from next really nice
that 25 quid it's soo personally I love
the difference in the different colors
on it obviously it would look really
nice if I had like my face still now but
ya never mind in fact it might spot a
bit skincare round because what I've
been doing with my spots and things
they're feeling so much better and I
think it's because I've been putting on
regen cream which is like a bio oil
alternative got it ages ago in fact it's
a bit old now but I got it in like a
little I think or an Aldi and it's just
like a bottle of orange oil collagen oil
in it it is I could buy a while cheap
and I've just been massaging it for
about a minute so into each spot every
night and they are very slowly going and
going down so quite enjoying that I'm
gonna gonna move for this but I'm gonna
get bored of seeing myself in a position
yeah one other thing I did want to talk
to you guys about actually was on Sunday
I posted my sexual assault story
it's called me to my story of sexual
assault I mean if you don't watch that
video I'll leave that link to up on the
screen so you can go and have a little
look at that but the response net has
been overwhelming and absolutely
incredible it achieved exactly what I
hoped it would and that it was getting
people talking about things it was
helping people open up it was also
helping some women realize what they had
experienced was in fact sexual assault
and that they shouldn't stand for it a
lot of women thought that particular
things that happened to them weren't
necessarily sexual harassment or sexual
assault I know like I realized now what
I've been sort of going through and it
was ah I mean the comments raps
incredible I think and thousands of
comments and I tried to get back to as
many as possible I mean I took hours now
as I wasn't trying to get back to people
because it was just so serious and I
really wanted to show everyone that I'd
read what they'd they'd replied so
massive thank you to everyone who
emailed me as well who deemed me who
tweeted me who text me just to talk
about it yeah I'm so glad it got people
talking about the me to movement and
opened some other people's eyes to it
which was amazing so a huge thank you if
you watch that and you supported it and
I really hope it helped okay so few
things happen so you we
and Olympus come round to show us how to
seal up this tracker I mean look how
cool this is see you like hold it on
like a little mini camcorder and it's
got a light on it and it's awesome like
I said it tracks like your velocity and
your speed and all that so super cool so
we've been look at that now just work
