hot so it's gone outside hope is happily
too loud it's already 9 me the heat is
ridiculous I'm it locked in this warm
coven it's going to get right into this
kind of appropriate seeing if this is
going to be a summer and like a summer
clothing beauty things I'm loving right
now I'll have to say essentials but
these aren't essentials every single
year offer everybody so these are things
that I'm currently really liking right
now I kick things off with some beauty
products first one up is this bad boy
boom boom cream I seem to be seeing this
everywhere by soul genera this smells
absolutely divine that smell like
vanilla Cher oh god this house I look
like caffeine in it I think so it's kind
of good if you wants lover all over your
legs and you build them then this should
really help kind of like perk it tone it
I know a lot of moisturizers claim they
do this but do they I don't know but I
definitely have some sort of little
sensation on my legs yesterday when I
use this and it just smells absolutely
amazing so I'm just going to stick with
the hype and hope the best oh it's just
so loud all the time
next up if you can watch my vlogs who
have seen these bad boys taking over my
world the it cosmetics CC creams they do
have SPF 50 in them so hello summer
goddess days these are so brilliant it's
all I've been wearing ever since I got
them no joke I want no other foundation
since I got leave about three weeks ago
they're so good I have shade fair and I
have shared likes and I like to mix them
together you have just turned the lights
my bad boy if I have not Tournament fair
if I'm in between the two together this
is just glow I'm not going to well I'll
I actually I don't have it on today to
perk up taking pictures or blog posts
this is our clients which I really like
so pretty
but everybody say this it's super glowy
is the CC cream coverage is wonderful it
cause redness it covers blemishes is
honestly so good so we're behind for you
summer lovers
those tan days that you want I have been
raving about this
I'm so obsessed even my mom has bought
this and that upset the glory alone that
looks at self-tanning tonight just
slobber all over you are you telling me
you don't have to do because this isn't
like a mousse it doesn't really get into
your hands the same way but I would
still recommend am it just to get
perfect application it also goes on your
face so perfecto all over just watching
these my vlogs you'll see me when I
still put on one night the next day I
wake up and just look super glowy
everyone's been asking Montana is and it
is this one and I cannot recommend it
more if you want to know my hometown's
it's just one ton Vita Liberata
phenomenal town of my to save now I want
to remove from this one for like a jelly
cream thing but both are awesome I'm
loving matter have some fun son Ambre
Solaire
is generally I just saw this in in my
bathroom I've got a whole bag of this
kind of on bristle and I thought I'd
mention it I generally go for SPF 50 for
the first like five days of them away
so if Emily wait five days anyway I see
fifty after that Jenna go down to about
thirty and never go lower than thirty I
generally don't really go into the Sun
that much though because there's no
point
I don't tan I prefer to take time for
her to save her skin but this is really
good it's an ideal bronze tan enhancing
protection spray just adds a little bit
more kind of color to you overall if you
use this and tanning it was helped to
kind of enhance your color a little bit
more so I mention it in case you're
looking for some new kind of SPF for
skin again I mentioned it in my vlog of
the dry bar just I think it's so
brilliant and for summer it is such a
winner this is a new contour kit the
shapeshifter from Urban Decay one side
is five different creams corrective
highlight
concealer and a contour bronzer color
and the other side is a palette which I
love even more I've been using this one
as a bronzer this has contour this is a
powder onto our powder and this is a
highlight and the colors are beautiful
I'll leave a link on the screen for
sorry for a blog post that I just put
together with this where I'm kind of
using it and put it on the skin it's got
more pictures so if you're after a new
contour palette and a thickness is
awesome it's got a mirror each side too
it's a such clever packaging and it's
about 39 pounds so I think for like all
those products
sort of a winner so good for summer but
I shadows
and go into recently that I think are
really great for summer shades it's
totally ruined I've had it with me in
every Travel Guide
it's the zoeva basic moment palette I
mention this in an upcoming kind of like
things I'm excited about and I've been
absolutely loving it it's great shades
of summer they've got really lovely
neutral crease shades more highlighted
shades in a corner but if you'll just
want to like smoke it out a bit go a bit
more sexy sultry than these beautiful
bronzy metallic key highlight colors
here are stunning it's just one of those
great travel kits throw it in you can
have more subtle day looks or like smoke
it out make it sexy for the night so
it's a sort of favorite for sure and
last thing I wanna mention as like so a
beauty fave I'm really loving are these
two products this one is brand new to me
but I've been trying it in past two days
and it's blowing me away this one I've
already had one of these styles before
and this is the nuance of this summer
because we bring my every summer the
bronze goddess by Estee Lauder and these
are pretty much just kind of like oils
with shimmer and gold particles inside
them so that when you're away on holiday
I always take one of these with me when
I go away and spritz all of my legs my
arms my different touch if I spot up on
this one now so his run you out for
libéré oh my yeah look at that we
imagine if I was like super town now and
it's a nighttime you're going on a date
and you're like candle lit and a candle
of the flight picking a promise
highlight orange like gold sex you just
gotta look client I've got it okay it's
got that was so extra of magic she's too
big big favorite I see a lot of bronze
goddess and also the brand-new lemare
I've got a Nima actually bit I'll leave
it link down below but two big favorites
and leave to my favorites in terms of
the smell I love the smell
okay Beauty over let's just go through a
few new closing bits and to be honest
because I spent so much time recently
with revolve a lot of things I'm going
to talk about are some revolved it's so
perfect for a summer first up this body
suit I cannot get enough of this I was
going to wear it for this video actually
I already had this on and I really love
this this is so pretty
it's a gorgeous blush day shade
it's low it's very low but it doesn't
make me feel too exposed
doesn't make me feel like my boobs are
gonna come out I've got a little bit
sighs we're going on here a lovely
dropped back as well since we've got
quite 65 oh it's long as well but if you
took this into a skirt awesome short I
love this guy I think it's super sexy
what the colour and this also is a bit
like well is mitad some knit fabric but
just with some shorts and some cool
shades aren't as think it's so sexy view
I will the cut your nails away with this
skirt which is a girlfriend denim skirt
love the shape of this love the fit it's
my kind of denim like a very light wash
denim it's just like cool after you in
model locks very chic very cool a little
bit of dressing around the butter and I
think this is very cool here in the
middle where almost looks like a pair of
jeans it's been cut and sewed back
together so they are a winner for the
summer for me always like denim shorts
denim skirts so if it isn't shorts these
really really into girlfriend gonna
honestly girlfriend run em it's such a
brilliant denim run if you're looking
for something so summer offer all year
round actually I love their jeans as
well
I'll just give you an idea of sizes I am
a size 25 in these probably could have
got away with a 24 I'm generally around
225 so pretty much fit true to size this
skirt is 24 yes so I'm kind of between
24 and 25 and girlfriend blend so I
would kind of bear that in mind
I'm usually about 25 so I go for your
size or a little tiny bit smaller but
again nice distressing on these and then
just very cool very chic off a big fan
of the little camis right this when it
comes to summer again it's just very
easy to wear without a bra for a girl
like me for all you girls with gorgeous
big boobs
maybe not you need to wear a bra with
this and maybe like a strapless bra but
growing up for me I love wearing this
with no bra on just you know get those
nipples out why the hell not you've come
in so many different colors and I adore
this shade it's very very pretty this
set I wanted to mention because I feel
like it's perfect for summer nights
and summer date nights especially if
you're going on holiday and it says set
from a major rail and it's such a
beautiful color of baby pink again do
you think I'm not I've not had been pink
in a while I'm quite I'm digging it for
this summer oh now this is a full maxi
skirt it's not the most lightweight
fabric but it is lightweight enough it
just means that you're not going to show
off your underwear underneath which I
really appreciate
it can buttoned down to a little bit
further down your legs but I had it a
little bit more open shell bit more kind
of leg through the slit totally loved it
and the thing I love the most is that it
comes with all you have to buy
separately but it's meant to come with
this top a little set I'll insert some
pictures while you might have seen this
already on my blog so much texture going
on this is kind of opened here in the
middle break off the ties here for your
beads captain I don't feel like my boobs
are going to fall out
I don't have to wear a bra yeah it's
just very some quite boho about it but
still very kind of like princess on
holiday vibes and the color is stunning
the other thing I want to mention is
this dress which are absolutely in love
with actually it's gorgeous it's got
these really pretty sleeves with little
bows and it's found out it's got some
yeah it's got a little bit of bowing
down front the boobs and to the sides
and it kind of comes round clasped
around your back here would like a bra
kind of fastening on them so it keeps
you in and it just goes down into a
little cooler stuff you into a little
mini dress like this cannot wait to wear
there's so much more and just a few bits
and terms of swimwear I'm really digging
this this is from got it from Avenue 32
it's solid and striped swimsuit it's
kind of like a cream ice cream shade
more than neon pink and the navy blue
nice low back on this as if it means
this kind of style of swimsuit when it's
not too revealing not too provocative
but still shows what flesh I think it's
more sexy than if you just go fall out
like getting your boobs out to nothing
it's just probably me but I really love
that a lot this bikini set I'm totally
in love with and I have misplaced the
bottoms for it and really
that thought I'll leave some pictures on
the screen because I think you guys a
little bit it's so pushing me look at
that color
with tan skin on even see I'll shine in
a way it's so pretty that I sort of
thrill that comes over the top it's a
little bound down these bits go around
your arms very sweet and they just all
kind of collects at the back in little
kind of bow and this from seat you may
have seen it in my very sassy photo
shoot that I go through Daleks we're
just playing around I was like make me
an accessory babe
so we would like to start there to
taking pictures and it was in this
swimsuit now this is for boning so it
comes up like this and it ties around
the back so there's no straps are
intimate that felt very very sexy in
this very nice not too sexy but pretty
not lovely look cutout detail it didn't
ride up my bum too much which I
appreciated
I think it's just really gorgeous
another cute little dress I want to
mention again it's more of a blush nudes
and a pink because more of a nude shade
but a very cute little mini dress again
and really really into these little tiny
sleeves is little fangirl Vander Bardot
sleeves I'm super cute and I like that
this comes together here over the boobs
with these little ties you can either
leave it a little bit more open you can
turn it more together I think this would
look amazing in a place suit as well I
kind of wish it was in a little short
but it's not a dress it's not on a dress
and it's the very very pretty cannot
wait to wear that last thing I want to
mention is this very very pretty dress
again it's in my blog I wore it on a
revolve trip and I think it's such a
gorgeous summery date night or girls
night out dress or clubbing dress if
you're going out for like a night out so
very textured but like catching so I've
no idea but is sorry about the smart
though it's difficult to say it kind of
like catches a line of fabric but I love
the way that the bottom is slit open
into two places here so it just kind of
covers everything but have little slits
up both legs and a little bit fat that's
got a little bit of side boob it's a
lovely low back and it just ties so
sexily around the top of the neck after
a while for the high ponytail and it
does look amazing with a board
