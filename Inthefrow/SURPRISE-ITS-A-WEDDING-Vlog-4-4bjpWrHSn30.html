feel guilty

Gorham for you guys because I'm probably

it's got some stains sort my coffee I'm
going to get myself into some gym gear
in a second
yes head to the gym get that out the way
and I can just chill for the rest of the
day oh and also very excitingly I just
put up on the best that you've ever on
my Instagram this is me with Victoria
Beckham literally life made I got so
it's pitches with her about a month or
so ago now
yeah what about four or five weeks ago
and she was showing us the new Victoria
Beckham Estee Lauder collection which if
you didn't already know she does this
question with a sale order first
collection was incredible like so many
almost called products know is which is
astounding it's amazing and she's
bringing out the second collection in
autumn I'm sure it's around September
time I really really cannot wait to get
my house in it so I got to go and have
this preview of it and meet Victoria
Beckham and also take a picture which if
you know me well you will know Victoria
Beckham is one of my biggest inspiration
she's one of my idols I think she's
absolutely amazing and she's so
inspiring for me so to meet her was
literally like meeting my number one
person in the world so you can imagine
my insides were like
I was able to post this picture today so
I'm just so pleased it looks like
everyone's really pleased me as well
from the comments it is brush washing
day so now I am washing all my faves I
keep the gallon size my brushes and I
only have a few and then I get some new
ones in or I find some of them are on my
pool
I remember how good this was back out
and then before I know it I've got loads
of brush it back again and don't need
this many and I probably use this one
this one this one put the light those
that and that that and that pull all
that I actually use times day today so
why I have double that but these are my
fifties it's going a little bit insane
but just watch my hair feel so nice
family wash it out to Calif I left it
since can wait I'll felt quite brittle
so just put loads of treatments on it
lift it up I'm not going to dry it come
on air dry
I'm currently covered in town so that's
why I'm wearing this big ugly shirt I'll
share really quite like this shirt but
I'm wearing this big shirt I've just
wash all the bedding so I thought I'll
turn in the day so that don't get my
baking ruined
so I'm also a little bit overly hot now
shirts bit thick so when I start working
on some blog posts finally it's like 6
o'clock or something ridiculous and I'm
not really doing much work Jax I've been
to the gym within cleaning do my brushes
