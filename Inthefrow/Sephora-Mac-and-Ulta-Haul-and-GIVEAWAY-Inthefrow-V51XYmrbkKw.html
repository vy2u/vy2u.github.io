beautiful when I was in LA I went a
little bit crazy and spent a fortune
would buy loads of things I'd had my eye
on I could get my hands on however I do
know that a lot of these products you
can get in UK so everything that could
find our link down below so don't worry
although this is a lot of American
products these are all things that can
probably get in the UK as well and also
stick around to the end because I have a
pretty exciting giveaway as well and I
know you all love my last giveaway this
one is awesome too so make sure you
stick around and find out more right and
i have three stores that i went to i
have mac i have altar and i have before
us so let's start with the forehead one
of Sephora this thing's first the new
nails virtual domination palette I was
obsessed with the guy bourdin palette
that they brought up last year and I
could get my hands on that one so when
this one came out I how to i just had to
get it it's got five different parts
inside so it's got a little guna bronzer
which we all know and love and i'm
hitting town at the moment so i need a
new one anyway i think this one here the
pink one up here is deep throat and this
one here is the Miss Liberty
highlighting blush powder well then
below are too limited edition blushes
one of them being sex fantasy and one
being final cut you know what nas like
for having their risk us titles for
their different products well look how
beautiful that is I haven't touched it
yet I thought I'd film first but what a
beautiful palette and massive mirror so
this is amazing if you want to go out
and about and do makeup beautiful
packaging got your bronzer you blush it
any highlighter and a few different
mixtures in there to use Rock you need
ok flat sales also sephora i picked up
some clips some purple hair grips I've
never seen purple hair grips and
obviously our purple hair I mean these
aren't quite the right call up but it
still can't keep to use I think these
were around two or three dollars I also
picked up this little cutie this is
the victor Ralph flower bomb but in a
little travel set I I mean I love flower
bomb and I also like to be able to keep
perfumes with me in my back but it's not
always handy to carry around a big
flower bar plus what if you break it and
you've ruined your 72 crowned perfume
you get this little cutie I mean like I
diners in cool it's a tiny little flower
bomb so you can take that around your
pics now this is kind of like an account
status he came to count it out you gotta
be careful with that but it also comes a
little fun on so use a funnel and that
you can refill it with this there's a
how many male I think something about 25
nil all together with all the different
things inside it ya know it's 22 mill
and it cost me I mean it wasn't exactly
cheap I mean it was kind of the same
price as you'd be paying a keyboard
bottle but small size but I just thought
it was super cute man how cute is out to
put your purse and carry around with you
the last thing I bought in sephora
alsager dipbrow I got this in the shade
soft brown I was going to go for medium
brown which is a bit a little bit darker
especially the moment as you might
notice my vitamin to me I Braff today I
just realized that I went to wear a
dress I've had my eyebrows recently died
that's probably why I'm not noticing
that I haven't done them my Heartland I
darker but in the store this looks about
the right kind of brown and I've seen so
many different people using these on
YouTube and our blogs and I mean I have
the anastasia brow wiz and i love that
pencil I've been using it a lot recently
so I thought I'd venture into this as
well because it is always good to use a
little brush and kind of really get
those really thin lines going on so I
treat myself to that as well I know it's
gonna be great because I know most
people love it count for reviews of all
these things by the way on my blog in
the food com that's it from Sephora
moving on I'll be mark next so I went to
Mac one on Hollywood Boulevard and
they were amazing you know to have this
lip liner you already know what I'm
going to say before I even say it will
lip liner this is apparently the lip
liner that can kylie jenner kylie jenner
where's and he'll it's also great i mean
they look great six months ago an open
talk about this whole lip thing for a
long time now but when i get something
in my head that I want something I don't
let it go and I really wanted this to
start to my collection and actually I'm
really really glad I have because I got
swoosh boom so I thought and got the
soul lip liner because it's meant to
really with a similar and that one is a
little bit darker than this one and i
also got velvet teddy and again it's not
the darker however i also got hall in
love lipstick and these two together are
much better i find there a little bit
lighter the more beige the more neutral
toned and they I think in much more of
the calla jenner lip so well with um
funny laughs can see it's very busy baby
with slight pink undertones and nude
interns really pretty and those who
together up beautiful as when little
schnapps in loved it I also got this
lipstick which I'm wearing right now
this insolence dick in heroin a
beautiful purple it's more of a purple
and if you are someone who loves the
poison berry lipstick from lime crime
which I do I know a lot of people sort
said well how do I get lime crime start
very excess london UK go for this
because this is Dutch such a jeep for it
this is a major Jeep so as you can see
now ellipsis super purple it says so
this is heroin and then I also got these
little cuties some never seen these in
our stores i bet i bet we can get them
now an outfit that but anyway the little
pigments but entirely sizes these are
ten dollars each I got the call of melon
which is a coral tone gold and also rose
which I thought looked a little bit like
cranberry the mac do I'm a little bit
lighter and I just thought they've been
really pretty for Christmas for
Christmas looks and especially if you
Soph make you brushes work for you apply
them they'll be really pigmented a
really glitter a a beautiful of
Christmas
and quite frankly the colors were just
too cute to say no to so I got to but
wait how Christmassy is this jumper it's
from the next I absolutely love it I got
it before put it on in a silo at this
site I love it ok last shop and on to
the giveaway at the end I finally picked
up the Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour full
finished foundation full coverage
foundation it's wonderful got it on now
I just added it onto my face buffed it
in a little bit I could add it even more
for much stronger coverage if I'd wanted
to and it's wonderful very similar to
laura macias or cream foundation just a
little bit thicker and a wonderful
wonderful shade this is in light to
medium sand I think don't say on the
bottle which is ridiculous but i'm
pretty sure call it should send him yes
light/medium sound I have so yeah
absolutely it's quite pricey it's about
35 pounds and fought your dollars but
it's just awesome and i also picked up
so call the box is frozen the light
cameras flashes think this one called
light camera lights camera lashes i
think and it's in a gold package well i
really wanted the waterproof one because
ordinary as I've said so many times
ordinary mascaras don't work with my own
lashes mileage to the two strikes so I
need what proof if I want to stay so i
got this one it's in the purple
packaging and it's very strange kind of
packaging it's very different but it
stands out in my drawer so that's good
enough i can find it and the brochure
just looks like a very ordinary simple
brush the kind of brushes are usually
love actually not too big not too fat
easy to apply again haven't use this yet
but i know a lot of people have talked
about how brilliant it is so I thought I
should give it a go so I did so got
those two things from tarp some super
excited about then I finally got myself
for the rack too after recently getting
the rack one as you know and raved and
rage and raved about it and people say
no you need to get the lorac to I prefer
that one so I did I had to get it I just
had to get it so I did I'm not tried it
yet but I know it's going to be just as
good as the last one because why
wouldn't it be this one has slightly
different tones to it more maps it's can
the very top row here is Matt very
button road that is
shimmers it's very different shades
really their master last palette so yeah
really really excited all that in fact i
can show you the last palette since Iraq
one and this is a little rap too this is
far more neutral a lot more Browns gold
tones they all kind of go together words
these are a little bit cans out there
lots of different things that go so I
pick this up and I'm really excited
about it and in the box you also get an
eyeshadow primer as well so that's
pretty cool and the very very last thing
I bought which you might have already
guessed by now while still Iraq one
which is my diff away prize in the UK
it's very difficult to get hold the rack
unless you want to buy it from nordstrom
online and pay twenty dollars shipping

pounds of dollars twenty-five pounds and

picked one up wats I was in in altar and
