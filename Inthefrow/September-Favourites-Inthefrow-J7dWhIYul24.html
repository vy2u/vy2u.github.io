of September and the start of October
and therefore this is my September
favorites it's alright we are we're not
too over now nearly but in the September
isn't it ok good
if you're new around these parts then
you may not know what a favorites video
is it's just my favorite products from
the past month what are we doing in
loved and I've got a few pieces as
always
darn off where's the Chanel hide your
beauty minecraft serum but if you also
want to he really loves your luxury skin
care this is beautiful it's it almost
looks like this little tiny micro beads
inside it when you push it out onto your
skin it's just like this is a really
beautiful consistency it sinks in
beautifully it's a wonderful serum and
I'm sure it's packed full of really
fantastic ingredients as well probably
read up on it if you're interested I've
really been enjoying putting this on
before makeup as an alternative to my
usual lush million dollar moisturizer
that I learned next up we've got the red
can pillow proof um dry shampoo
this is an amazing product it is the
best dry shampoo you'll ever buy it
soaks up any oils in the hair with so
much ease without having that horrible
cloggy horrendous feelings that when
when you put in some dry shampoos it
just you guys
anja fingers for your hair anymore
because it's so clogged and so full of
product and I hate that feeling I'd
rather how greasy hair than that kind
feeling in my hair this however
completely different you don't get that
feeling you can literally put it through
and it just soaks up any oils and you
can still feel like your hair is your
hair
I've never trance and like it I was just
blown away on the first Tuesday I was
mentioned this on my snapchat and a few
people even message me and said oh I've
picked it up because you're talking
about it's so highly loved this so much
next up is product that absolutely wowed
with me when I tried it and I have it on
my face right now it is the me me me so
I can see like how bright it is in here
but the mimimi mimimi angel face blemish
balm cream I'm not sure what color that
says quit doesn't seem to say so I'm not
sure if it's just the wand color but for
me this suits pretty perfectly it's kind
of similar to NARS oval which is my
usual shade it's really light it's quite
hydrating as well on the skin it sinks
and beautifully and it also doesn't give
me that dry feeling like well cut my
skin after I bought it in it looks like
it's full of moisture
it looks like I've seen some kids a skin
perfectly and the skin still looks
plumped and hydrated I guess a lot of my
foundation sometimes I can look at them
really close in the mirror and it looks
like I've got this powder on there on my
skin it just doesn't look that great it
doesn't look that healthy whereas this
it just gives you that beautiful healthy
glow like my skin looks so radiant and I
put this on big big fan of this favorite
cleanser at the moment has to be this
one from Lancome at sea gels
matte clarifying cleansing close up
early foam this product I mean don't get
it in your eyes it does hurt quite a bit
but there's something about this app so
it grips the skin like nothing else like
you've got to put on your fingers and I
in the past have tried it with a dry
face and dry fingers and it doesn't work
into skin my useless since what your
fingers a little bit with this on it and
work into the face and it foams up so it
almost feels like a really thick foam on
the face and I almost feel like it kind
of clings the dirt and it pulls it out
and so what I usually do is I'll put
this on and then I use an exfoliating
brush like foreo cleanse that I use or a
Clarisonic brush it through and it
really works so great with this foam
anonymous foams up all over gets rid of
all the crap and all the dirt out your
skin and then I use a hot cloth and I'll
just wipe it all away and my skill and
my skill and my skin feels so bright and
cleansed and completely clean and that's
what I really love to have that feeling
so yeah love this although a fashion
week I took this with me to my hotel and
used it twice
obviously and I love it the last beauty
product is this it's what I've got on my
lips right now I've won this quite a lot
recently
it's the Topshop lip matte lip bullet in
get to meet body it's a great autumnal
roasted red brown shade nothing too
overly plumbing and nothing too Brown
it's that perfect in the middle shade of
like a deep autumn ready for an off it's
beautiful and really great I don't think
it would suit me so much until I put it
on and put it on with a lip liner I
recorded entire makeup routine so I'll
leave the link down below if i've
already posted it up from about to post
it and I use it in there and I used it
with a darker lip liner from Topshop but
a really deep color laid this over the
top it's a big winner for me especially
for the autumn months so highly
recommended just gonna move on to a few
closing bits first up
cutest slippers ever they're from emu
the lovely mo purple shade and then this
wonderful sheepskin lining they're so
wonderful I mean I know slippers aren't
the most attractive thing ever but for
around the house these are gonna be
wonderful when it gets a little wintry
but it's make me feel really odd to know
wearing these run the house and I also
got Alex a pair as well in brown and he
does not take them off II wear them now
babe yeah oh yeah II love this these
always walk around this little brown
shoes on so I like to wear my dick so be
super cute
my favorite watch at the moment if you
read my blog in the fro comm you'll have
seen this in pretty much every single
outfit post there is I'm absolutely in
love with it it's a stunning rose gold
from Larsson and Jennings a metal
wristwatch I adore watches anyway but
this one is just so beautiful clips on
like this a lovely large face I really
love the kind of more masculine large
face watches and always have beautiful
what I love that so much this backpack
this all that Kili backpack took this
recently away to Italy with me and it
was such a good idea taking this it was
perfect for keeping my Cameron for
keeping all my essentials I've never
kini or
extra shoes and bits and bobs so I could
have my tiny little cute
Chloe bag or every bag I had that day
little handbag but then I had this
gorgeous little backpack
it's such a great set just you can see
the families according to my back but
really tiny really sort of small but it
fits load in and I just totally fell in
love with it actually nice orange inside
but it'll load and there and it's also
got a front pocket too but it's almost
like a little you can hold it like this
if you want or you can put it on your
back which is what I really loved about
it course all the links are down below
for all this products there's always the
next two products are actually a bit
more intimate and a little bit more
personal whatever they want to show you
them because a lot of my audience are
women and they may potentially like
these products brough lingerie I
absolutely love my beautiful laundrette
feel it makes me feel so much more
confident and sexy I guess these are two
new bras that I wanted to mention that
are absolutely beautiful this top is
from our jump rockateur I talked about
algebra so much this is one of their new
season bras
it's the most gorgeous bra ever nude
mesh on which is this embroidery with a
little beads can you see that but on the
skin obviously you won't go to see the
new mesh all you get to see is this
embroidery so it almost looks like this
black floral lace print tattooed over
your isms and it's absolutely gorgeous
I just got this in my normal size as
well if you're wondering as an
alternative this one is from another
lingerie brand that I absolutely adore
called fleur of England they make some
stunning pieces and this is one of their
new bras in their ranges it's lovely
thick I'm guessing that satin or silk
band around the middle that closes with
two buttons a lacy front and then the
back is beautiful this is down the back
it
hatches almost like a race the box it
goes down the middle
this lovely lacy bit here and then
attaches to the strap at the back but if
you're someone that really likes your
lingerie and if and you like to wear it
because it makes you feel more confident
and beautiful like I don't then I
thought you might like this another
product I wanted to mention for any
leather trousers fans these are from
Josh Homme where it's a brand I love
these are around 330 pounds but if
you're someone who has been hunting for
leather trousers for a while you will
know that that is actually a very good
price for a pair of leather trousers the
majority say if you want to look at
Joe's about acne you're looking at 700
to 2,000 pounds repair of real leather
trousers so when I saw these and I
realized they were in the through Japan
range of like amazing and these fit me
like a dream these are a size six I'm a
size 6 or the truth spies they're a
fantastic length of sailor about 32 leg
length 32 leg length not nothing too
long no pockets on the bum but the
waistband fits me like a dream like it
just they just fit the way you would
want to let the traps to fit they don't
ruffle too much at the knees they're
just really great I will leave a link
down below to a blog post where I'm
wearing these so you can see a lot more
pictures of them but if you're after
leather trousers and you've got a little
bit more money to spend but you don't we
spend in the 800 pound range things I
would massively recommend another
leather product this is my pride and joy
at the moment this is my Marg
in fact it's in the same blog post as
the leather trousers this is my new Marg
suede jacket I've been after a suede
jacket like this in real suede for a
while and I found my purse that one and
it is this one so again I'll leave
pictures to the blog post down below you
can go and have a look at this but for
me it's a stunning suede beautiful soft
suede it's got a few little details like
these set
on the shoulders lots of little buttons
and fastenings got a zip as well as
buttons and it does also have pockets
length of sleeves is perfect they're a
nice width as well so they're not too
baggy and not too slimming it's just the
perfect jacket to me so yes so if you're
after a real suede jacket and you've got
a few more pennies to spend then you may
really like it all the links will be
left down below for you can go buy the
products as per usual
