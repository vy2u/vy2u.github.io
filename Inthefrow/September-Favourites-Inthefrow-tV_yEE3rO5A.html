last film two favorites video so today I
figured out film a favorites video for
September so this is my September
favorites the main things I've been
loving this month are Beauty cosmetics
so I show those first then I'll show you
one or two of the things and also love
in this month is its my favorite
products of all time at moment the Zen
tan Moroccan Isle and is really dark
weakly self-tanner that you apply to MIT
do not use your hands I made that
mistake and it was awful apply it to MIT
all of you body and then you leave it
for like eight hours and then after
eight hours like wash it off and shower
it off and just left with an amazing
glow I am usually really really pale but
I've been using this like every four
days and now look quite nice lots of
glow and it's just amazing it doesn't
streak
it doesn't smell really awful and it is
the most natural looking tan you will
ever get out the bottle so although it's
about 21 pounds but remitted pounds is
highly worth it and I am continuously
buying this one off - no that is so just
to make sure I never run out so this is
amazing
continuing with the tanning theme we've
got the Clarion's liquid bronze
self-tanning it's like a soft egg milk
and totally different to zone-tan and it
doesn't come out dark and therefore it's
all of your body dark straightaway this
is just like almost like a creamy
moisturizer and you apply it onto your
face so it's kind of like a white
moisturizer you apply all over your face
and then the I often do it right before
bed at night quite all over my face I
make sure it's really even - nothing's
missing and you've got a seam out all of
your face and any leaf it all night
making sure that you also don't drink
something so that you sort of rub it all
away from your mouth or touch your face
or anything you gotta make sure your
face stays completely covered all night
in the mornings
we would like a really gorgeous glow so
this I've been loving on my face and
then I've been playing this and tell
them I bought it and then wake up and
feel like a bronze goddess next favorite
is this eyeliner from eiko it's a skinny
black liquid eyeliner and it just it's
just like a felt-tip and so much my last
video how I mentioned about the NARS
eyeliner very it's just very soon light
slightly thick nib on this and the other
one but it's just so easy to create a
cat eye it's really really black
it goes on so fluidly you don't have to
keep rubbing it against your eye and
it's really really good stop I'm
reaching for this every single day and
every single night out so this is
something I will it's now look at my
favorite and I will continue to buy this
because it's a bad good mix favorite is
this lipstick from a Giorgio Armani
which I'm wearing now and it is this
beautiful deep plum and called plum 6f -
really really deep almost looks like a
perfectly black and when you apply two
EPs it's like a deep purple
yeah with a hint of red and I don't
usually go for dark lips a lot I usually
have a lot of nude lips and baby pink
lipsticks but I'm completely changed my
mind about a lip sticks now really
really like them just enough for winter
ice it's quite damp it's quite sexy and
I quite like it so I'm really really
really enjoying purple dart lipsticks
now so that's a winner and another
favorite that keep going back to is the
Illamasqua androgen pigment
I've had this now for a few months I
should go away with me to America three
months and it is just even though I've
used it most days it is still
practically full and it's just so it's
the most perfect pink color for me
really it's a lot a little bit peachy
but mostly a baby pink perfect for plan
I love your lips amazing as a cheap
Clarisse as a treat for pretty much
every day
you could use it as an eyeshadow as well
if you want it but it's about 22 pounds
of thing it's about 22 pounds and it is
just one of the best products I've ever
use so this is a highly recommended
another Illamasqua product it's a
favorite this month and it's from their
sacred art collection and it's the
reflection palette it's for creamy silky
eyeshadows and blend really really well
for beautiful colors and perfect to sort
of build up a really smoky eye look and
that kind of thing which I love doing
for most nights and they're just so so
silky I feel like silk when you apply
there and they blend beautifully
together and they're so pigmented
absolutely love this at the moment
not that I blogged about fully about
eight months ago now around the time I
started my blog was this and it's for
Mac Pro Longwear concealer I've not
really mention its sense of what it is
pretty much my most favorite concealer
I've ever used and it's just so I'm
wearing it's kind of the perfect shade
this is nw20 so it's a perfect shade for
me it blends really beautifully if you
make sure that you set it after you've
applied it lasts all day and it's just
one of those I totally trust to do the
gel wanted to do so this is something
that I will continue to buy Cynthia runs
out which I hope it doesn't matter if a
beauty favorites I've just got one or
two other products that I loved this
month so I'll show you those this being
this little suitcase from empty partners
thought printed suitcase collection this
is like 65 pound but it's just so human
tiny I just really really love it it's
just look at this ornament for my
bedroom - so I'm just leaving it on the
side of my bedroom and it's a sort of a
talking point feature and I know a lot
of people collect vintage suitcases like
this so for kind of vintage suitcase
collector this would be I'm anything
and it was like she was so cute my
favorite clothing item this month have
been this play suit which and I got from
Mimi calm and it's a motel place eight
and so got online now and it has got
this really cute sheer fabric just sort
of passing going through it so if it's
quite sure but somewhere black brown Dre
looks really really lovely and and then
it goes down with the song little shirt
for the bottom it's long sleeved which
is really nice replacing the soft makes
it a little bit more sort of
sophisticated minot and it's got a
lovely low neckline so it's just quite
quite pretty quite sexy so absolutely
love that wall up the jay-z concert last
night when I went to and loved that and
my last favorite that thought I would
mention is my shellac manicure they're
not looking the very best at the moment
and because I'm coming to the tower I
need to have them redone but I've had
them done a few times now and I really
really love the finish and it just sort
of feels so much about yourself you've
got your nails done sometimes and the
 of these opposite don't ship and
you've got great nails for about three
weeks it's just for me it's totally
worth the price in the way that it makes
me feel so every single month now I'm
gonna go and get your like a manicure so
I highly recommend a if you're a girl
who loves how many nails done so they
fit that big favor this month my
favorite jewelry license month has been
this one from Topshop and it's a Pegasus
necklace in silver and it's kind of a
it's more of a collar necklace so the
perfect with like a peter pan collar so
I'm just sticking out through the middle
just sort of a statement piece but I
just have so many compliments of this so
many people and and I absolutely love it
and it's only about 14 pounds so it's
quite a bargain really for that and
that's it short and sweet I hope you
enjoyed it please give it a thumbs up if
you did and let me know if you want me
to make any more favorites videos or
know what kind of other videos you might
want me to film and I will
try and do that as soon as possible go
