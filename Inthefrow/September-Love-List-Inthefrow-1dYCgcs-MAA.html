doing really really well this is my sep
tember love list if you didn't see the
August love list just a quick recap I'm
creating this new series called a lot
list monthly so all this littlest septum
Ella lists the idea which is to share
with you things that I loved the
previous month that weren't necessarily
products September love list which is
now will include things I've loved for
sep tember up to now as well as half of
august so pretty much everything since
the last one or be in this video a lot
of you seem to love my last one so I'm
just continuing with it and it's so nice
do it a little bit different so i really
hope you enjoy this one just as much
let's just get right into it okay first
up my favorite thing to watch this month
things I've have been really enjoying
watching x factor just for pure brain
numbing Glee easy watching footage you
know can so you can sit in front the TV
I just watch it and just relax so X
Factor Made in Chelsea la i always love
watching me Chelsea again it's a super
easy to watch I'd also say i am at
moment getting back into watching one
tree hill melee seen Lydia always chat
about one tree hill and how much we love
it blue on my favorite shows of kind of
all time relays just kind of grew up
watching that show when I love it and I
found the Box step today I'm going to
buy some of the box sets I think I
dreams I can watch it all the way
through so that is what I've been loving
this month my favorite photo of the
month I'd probably have to say is this
one I'll put it here this was from a day
out that me and my best friend had in
covent garden inside comic garden at the
moment that got this really cool kind of
like bubble cloud sculpture thing going
on it's just really really beautiful and
it just reminds me of an awesome day I
had with my best mate we bought Ben's
cookies we went and have some food
tried wails nearby and we just caught up
on the past few months because she lives
in manchester I left her in Manchester
it's just so nice this photo reminds me
of a really good day who I loved this
month again it's a tricky one last month
was Carly Rowena who is a total babe the
person going to choose this month is a
wonderful lady called tomorrow and she
writes a blog for glam and glitter and
we spent loads of town together recently
we're going to ibiza together we're
potentially going on a trip in october
as well which is going to be very very
exciting probably one of the most
supportive people i know when it comes
to what i'm doing and the blog and
YouTube and everything else she's just a
truly amazing person she's super glam
gorgeous and she really inspires me
every day with everything I'm doing and
that she deserves so many more
subscribers guys like she's really great
I love her so I will leave all her links
down below and can go and check her out
she's a total babe so what I wore this
month this is a beautiful sleeveless
jacket from Reese a gorgeous woman
gray-marl with a belt brother middle
pockets and it's a really great length
and I've been after one of these I mean
I've got quite a few but none of the
quality of this it's a really great
amazing fabric that will last all winter
and into next winter and will be a
classic peaks and if color and in the
silhouette and the court of this I think
I'll get so much wear out of it for
years to come as well so this has to be
my favorite purchase and the thing I've
been wearing this month otherwise it
would be my Chloe bag my Chloe drew bag
which I love it's favorite way that I
spent my time this month well apart from
the fact the month bit of a workaholic
and I barely ever stop working the other
night I just sat in front of the TV
granted I did have my laptop and I was
logging but i sat in front of the TV
Alex without and I
had about five hours worth of watching
one tree hill back-to-back hence why
it's my favorite things to watch this
month but I'll just watching it back to
back and I just had like a drink with me
and I have pizza I ordered a pizza room
favorite food of the month now this is
quite an easy one I have recently come
obsessed with crab avocado on toast so
toast coated with like bashed up
avocados Kota didn't like pulled crap to
the crabbits up and really like mess
stops it's a little bits on top a little
bit chilly crackers like black pepper
and salt is divine I'm obsessor keep
saying to Alex life can we go out to
lightweight rose and buy some crab meat
so we can have it on a Picardo and in
fact why are you so obsessed with this I
actually don't know I'm just really
really enjoying that taste ok favorite
drink of the month hmm oh I know I know
I know they were doing of the month
definitely if you follow me on snapchat
you've seen me going on about this in
the day it's the new coster watermelon
and strawberry cooler things sure how to
do like the different juices that are
like with ice well this is a new one
it's the watermelon and strawberry
flavor it is absolutely delicious it
tastes like something between a fat
lolly and a watermelon lolly that
delicious I slowly flavor so definitely
try it out if you like watermelon tea
light strawberry like I do oh you will
love it it's so good okay my favorite
thing that I did this month was that I
went to the Olympus Scottish Fashion
Awards if you saw my latest video which
was my dead get ready with me for the
Scottish fashion awards have seen that
that's where i went to in this beautiful
gold maxi thigh high split dress been
revealing but i felt really really nice
in it but it was a really really great
night and it was nice to spend time with
Alex and go to an event like that and
see some of our friends there and hang
out with a limp purse like I'm really
good friends with the guys at Olympus
now oh so much so actually that if you
like my olympus pen
camera this is a camera i use for
vlogging and also for taking rob post
pictures on the mountain about and
olympus have given me an exclusive code
that will get you 25 cent off this
camera and lenses which makes it much
cheaper than anywhere else yes so if you
want that i'll leave the link just down
below for you can go get the code to go
to an advanced it up just in case some
of your art aspiring bloggers or lovers
could be release or favorite song of the
month this is pretty easy for me has to
be just envy about what do you mean if
anyone's like Justin be that I didn't
used to be a fan either but recent years
I've kind of felt that he does put out
some pretty great tunes he has gotten
really good vice quite like his music
especially that Thun it's just so catchy
listen it over and over and over again
and the music video was so like sexy I
was like one wow totally seen just in a
different light here favorite thing that
I you okay I'm just SAT here for five
minutes thinking about this and I've
decided pull it a favorite thing that
I've used is this with you the cocoa
muah schnell perfume my first ever
Chanel fragrance and quite frankly I'm
in love with it he often go the noir
sense when it comes to fragrances so the
option do that more fresh scents and the
de Noir which always find there a little
bit more musky of smoky or deeper richer
fragrances and this was so beautiful
it's just got that very typical and
famous Chanel sent but with much more
deep intensive fragrance so yeah I place
take this and that is it for the
loveless this month I kind of feel like
I did want to do as much this month
time but I mean this mont go for it's
going to be so hectic and so much going
on boil for choice in the next love list

enjoy this again make sure you give it a
