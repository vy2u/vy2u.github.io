everything a bit up by the way for any
outfits I wear yeah let's go get some
food

the service is insane just having a few
bits to eat the fries up to bed and I'm
having a really delicious glass why is
it cause you got some egg whites with
noodles and some cream puffs and some
complimentary pastry
how tired are you our scale of 1 to 10
right now I'm so tired
oh let's eat the salad translator good
morning is 7:30 a.m. we thought we'd
wake up early do want a bit who leg
today we're thinking of doing a gym
session but I think that we have low
energy so let's just scrap that idea

fruit salad and I've got two scrambled
eggs with a hash brown and and tomatoes

fresh watermelon juice so we've got a
little setup here as a restaurant meal

see the tops of those buildings you
could see yesterday it's incredible
that's going to ruin our day secondly
dampen our spirits lots to do today

going to head off now just to look
around Hong Kong a bit we've got them

a Hong Kong time we've got about two
hours or so just kind of explore a
little bit
get back 5 12 and to get ready for my
first trip on a very very light coat of
makeup I know eyes cause didn't want to
after taking off my eyes because as you
may know I get very watery eyes so
that's the point
