a new sit down shut video I really enjoy
doing these sorts videos I was tagged by
the beautiful Tanya burr to do the happy
skin tags so I figured that's what it's
gonna do today I haven't done the sort
of morning routine evening routine skin
care routine think yet so I thought this
might have quite a nice way of give me a
bit of an insight into my skincare so
this is going to be the happy skin tag
we have 11 questions to get through all
about how I keep my skin clean and
healthy and glowing as much as I can do
so let's get into it how would you best
describe your skin I would describe my
skin as well it used to be more normal
skin I would have said more normal but I
would say it's a little bit more dry
these days I don't know whether it's
because I've moved to London its massive
air pollution and all that I'm not too
sure or whether it's products that I've
been using that's made my skin much more
dry but I just find it is a little bit
more dry nowadays so I really enjoy
using products that add more glow more
agents and much more of a moisture boost
back into my skin so question 2 is what
are your main skincare concerns I guess
that would be it would be the fact that
it looks quite dry it feels quite dry
and therefore I like to use products
that to give it more of a boost and more
a fake below I hate to feel like my skin
is quite dull and quite sallow and
doesn't have much color to it so I
really enjoy using products that can
help to really sort of lift the colour
and make my face look much more radiant
and glowing so that's why I really
prefer juhi makeup as well because it
just gives you that much more of a
natural glow about the skin there's
quite a lot of products that I use for
this reason that are much more about the
regents and boosting and adding more
glowing skin one of them being the
brought a sharp vitamin C range I'm sure
you've seen me talk about the vitamin C
range number of times now you know that
I love the body shop products and this
one is particularly great it's a globe
boosting moisturiser it's got quite a
gel formula
it's quite like sunshine inside it's
really quite bouncy lovely gel and as
you apply it it just sinks in
beautifully into the skin but it leaves
this sort of a beautiful glow about the
skin almost like it wakes at the skin so
products like this are perfect so they
really help those sorts of moisturizers
and I guess I've also noticed recently
that I pause around this area have
decided to get a little bit bigger as
I've sort of matured over the past few
years I guess so any way that I can
tackle that is by using things like the
insta blur from body shop or all the
products like primers primers of that
sort of nature that really helped to
slide up the skin and create this
effective base so that you paws are much
more invisible and you makeup looks
gorgeous next question is what's the
weirdest natural ingredient you've ever
used in your skincare routine I would
say one of the strangest things that I
ever used while snail gel from a brand I
come in but it was now but it was snail
gel in this little pot and it was just
quite a viscous strange gel that was
quite odd so to say that was something a
little bit different I used but
otherwise it honestly I haven't been
that adventurous with my skincare in
that way know that people love to make
face masks out of coconut oil are out of
avocados or other fruity acidic
substances but I actually haven't but
maybe I should maybe this is telling me
that I should do that
the next question is quite deep Wang it
is how do you define happiness when this
question is related to skincare
happiness and hope to keep my skin happy
or whether it's just generic happiness
in my life I suppose I would define
happiness
I think I'll define happiness as a
contentment in life feeling content with
everything all the pieces of your puzzle
that come together really well so
whether it's your relationship your work
your home your family life your
friendships and having a contentment
that everything is falling into place
and that you don't feel like one thing
is lacking
I suppose if we're relating this back to
skincare the happier you are it's
personal definitely does shine through
in your skin I believe stress can cause
massive concerns for skin and you know
feeling happy is off cigar self radiate
back through you yeah that was a good
answer next question
grab your skincare routine in five words
the skincare routine goes from cleaning
your face to adding more products to
then take them off again to added more
products so in the kind of taking off
stage I'll say use a thorough process I
say it's about a deep clean and then
when it comes to applying my products
I'd say it was about ultra hydration
moisturizing and boosting whether that's
radiance or moisture or just uplifting
the scared yeah next question
tell us your top skincare tip recently
I've noticed a massive difference in my
skin because I have been using the
exfoliating brushes those little devices
are really kind of work away and
exfoliate skin that used for a few
minutes so I've noticed a big difference
actually through these nose and I notice
that the texture of my skin and the
feeling underneath my skin is feeling a
lot more smooth and brighter and I find
that my products seem to sink into the
skin a lot better now because I use that
next question what makes you laugh every
day
I'm Alex I think he says those random
weirdo but I love that though because I
think any relationship that doesn't have
that laughter and happiness in it
it's definitely lacking so the fact that
we make it to the laughs and we enjoy
our day it's just so much better you
know it's it's better for your mood it's
better for your feelings and emotions
and obviously then it's better for your
skin as well it just gives you that
natural glow you know a laugh it just
makes you look happier and your skin
look brighter
what steals your skin's natural radiance
well first of all if we're talking
technically there are some foundations
that I feel aren't properly suited to my
skin and don't give me that radiant jewy
look that I really love I would say some
moisturizers although they're great a
great for moisturizing don't give you
that glow that I feel that I really want
sometimes it can be a few days before I
go out the house because I've been
working and doing things I haven't
needed to leave the house and I think
that sunshine definitely helps getting
out getting that natural radiance on
your skin definitely helps to boost it
as well and I do feel that after a few
days in the house my skin just feels a
bit dull yeah I'll just say time in the
house without some natural daylight
definitely saps the life out of your
skin
yeah particular products that don't
really work enhancing it what they are
top tips for healthy glowing skin well
to be honest it would kind of be a
mixture of the things I've already
mentioned I think exfoliating brushes
are fantastic they help you to absorb
products better into the skin after
you've exfoliated and they how to unclog
pores as I've mentioned if every layer
of your skincare really helps to add
that sharing and boost back into the
skin that's going to massively help so
using things such as these glowing
moisturizers that straight away when you
put them on you can see them catching
the light and you look Julie and
gorgeous and then you put another coat
foundation over the tapping like even
more incredible
that would be my massive tip of the
moment in fact I'm going to be doing a
makeup routine very soon on that kind of
premise using things really brightening
moisturizers and then building upon it
to show you how to create much more dewy
finish because that's what I've been
loving recently and I've also really
been loving using products over the top
of my moisturizer in between my
foundation I'm sandwiched in between and
you may have seen it a few times in
videos I've done recently as well and
they've been these really light
reflecting they're not really primers
but like bases that go underneath your
foundation again to add this rage that's
back in I use one day of the week that
was quite bronzed toned and I brushed it
all over the skin and just added this
sort of always light back into the skin
before the foundation area there were
quite a lot products that do that same
job it just depends on which one you
really really like I've got one here
that I've been using recently as well
which is the body shop vitamin C instant
glow enhancer which is again a new
product it's the still tired and grumpy
skin which as I mentioned I sort of feel
at my skin is like that sometimes this
is perfectly suited for me
it looks quite orange and quite bright
cream you can say that and then when you
mix into the skin it almost gives this
it's a very low tint almost so you could
have this all over the skin and it will
have the tint back into the skin which
in effect will give you this Regents are
more of a glow it's perfect for those
days when you don't know where as much
makeup and officer the less makeup you
wear the moist skin can breathe so
something like this followed by a BB
cream or a CC cream or tinted
moisturizer perfect if you're someone
that likes to brave more a bare face and
this loan will probably do you really
really well
so as attendant it's more primer it's
got a soft velvet finish to it and then
you can add your foundation over the top
and it'll look even more affected so it
can't go wrong next question is what's
your skincare 101 so I'm guessing this
just means all about the basics of
skincare and what I would suggest it
would be never leave your makeup on at
night always always take your makeup off
before you go to sleep or you've got on
for a long time always moisturize in the
morning before makeup
before bed recently I would suggest two
cleanses so I would suggest when you've
had makeup on
always use an eye makeup remover to
remove it then use a face wash
- almost exfoliate and get rid of
everything off your face and then use a
cleanser to go in remove anything else
in there and then that's the time I'll
use an exfoliating brush or a flannel
it's almost like you're doing a to
cleanse step and then you can tone if
you want to I don't turn too often I'll
be honest but I'm all about the
cleansing and in the moment it's about
two cleanses and they'll go and put a
serum or a moisturizer on my face add
some lip balm and then I do my hankering
a last question is what is your happy
place
I do love my bed I love bedtime even if
it's been a fantastic day and I've
really enjoyed it and I've been out
doing things there's no better feeling
than crawling into bed when you've had a
shower and you're all fresh and clean
and you've got lovely sheets on the bed
and it's super comfortable and just sort
of drifting away and that's all the
questions I really hope you enjoyed that
and it gave me a bit more of an insight
into my skin care how I look after my
skin I must have met recently like I
said after I've been for much more of a
process is sort of - cleansing using a
brush using much more these sort of
energizing products all the time I've
noticed a massive difference recently
I'm I haven't broken out in about two
weeks
touchwood it's not gonna happen now I've
just said that and jinx myself but yeah
my skin's been doing really really well
so I'm actually quite pleased with it at
the moment
