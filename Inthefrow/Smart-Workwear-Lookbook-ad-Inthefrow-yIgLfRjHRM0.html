all really really well recently I've
been noticing how many of you are really
enjoying my holes and look books and
fashion videos so I'm just wanting to do
a lot more of those really for you and
this video has been so requested over
the years to do a work West Pacific haul
this video is also in collaboration with
a sauce which as you all know as well as
my favorite brand so I pretty much
behind my entire wardrobe off of that
website they've recently created some
new sections on their store for work
work so there is corporate wear which is
much more professional put together
stricter dress code and they also have a
smart work wear section which is a
little bit more relaxed but still very
sophisticated and smart work work I just
wanted to put this together for you guys
to inspire you hopefully show you what I
would wear if I worked in office
situation or if I was going for an
interview or if I was going to anything
that really required me to dress up
smart and professional and very slick
let me showing you a few different
outfits with a mixture of these
different types of clothing in them and
hopefully it inspires you for your new
work wardrobe Elsa Tuan is a corporate
work wear choice built around this Navy
trouser suit from Vesper a sauce the
Blazer and Charles has both incorporate
the gold button detailing around the
ankles and the costs that fits perfectly
with the girl detailing on this mini
Henri Bendel approach and then Wallace a
sauce white d-ring blouse a pulls in at
the waistline I talk to infants trousers
for sleek and refined style and then
added some Jean Peter Russell Court
heels for stylish and premium finish
I think Navy white and beige always
excellent color choices if you're going
for corporate work where look in most
cases you can't go wrong or the trouser
suit if you're hoping to look really
really professional outfit 2 is another
corporate work wear option I sell this a
soft black scalloped pencil skirt with
this white flirty blouse and I've talked
it into keep the pair neat and simple a
Wallis Rose beige wreath jacket is an
option for outerwear and with the belt
it can really cinch in the waistline the
black suede kitten heels from estas make
sure the outfit stays professional and
stylish whilst also offering a
comfortable heel choice whilst the Chloe
Drew handbag adds a little pop of extra
color outfit three is taken from
corporate work wear section again
although I think this oversized gray
coat from Paisley a sauce can really
dress down block to a more smart work
great option khaki green a saucer wrap
dress covers to just below the knee for
feminine yet modest finish and a cup
sleeves just off a little extra shape
and style the black suede heeled boots
also from a sauce and their low enough
just to stay comfortable get the cutout
detailing makes them feel a little more
fun and stylish
and out before might just be my favorite
with greymouth sleeveless jacket from
reese so that provides a really chic and
fashionable finish to this whole look
the look is definitely more of a smart
work wear option this white crop shirt
from Hobbs just meeting the waistline of
the black a sauce trousers which I've
rolled off at the bottom to show off
more of a nude beige heel and then for
accessories I've added this purple toned
Henri Bendel totes and some thick
black-rimmed Valentino glasses just for
a little bit more personality and there
