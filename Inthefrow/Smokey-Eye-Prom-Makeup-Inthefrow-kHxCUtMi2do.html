of prom - and this is a look that
decides to go for it's a very kind of
shimmery dark smoky eye with lots of
contouring and a nude lip and so many of
you requested that I put together a bit
of a tutorial of how I got this look so
I thought I would do to trial for you so
if you like this look then please keep
watching to start sort of priming my
face I've been using these three
products from soap &amp;amp; Glory and this one
is the make yourself useful
youthful super serum and this one is C
for daily youth lotion all over it's
part of a serum and its really lovely on
the skin really kind of light and then
we're taking a little bit off thing rice
- lotion and going over the top so now
at this point I'd let that dry for about
10 minutes and let it sink at your skin
and it gives you a really beautiful base
to start with Nick - okay so then I will
take my two favorite foundations now
these are Laura Mercier sort cream
foundations I have to mix the two
together and it's only when I'm just
super town and I can get away with a
beige ivory otherwise dolls have Korean
ivory so usually our next two together
and I get the perfect shade don't need
too much this product because it really
is go along way so I like a little tiny
amount of each to do it down on each
cheek and round circular motions it's
not too buff I in all of them although
they may treat when all around the
hairline until years down onto the neck
Punta beach in line so it's all blended
down I will first of all use the
collection
mm concealer this is the one in fair but
you just put on a couple of blemishes
under here anyway just lighten up around
the nose tama days i started using this
brush and african sealer it's a sigma
tapered blending brush in a 40
really soft big fluffy head and I found
it's fantastic for doing concealer will
be blending it into the skin now this
I'm going to use this Pro Longwear
concealer I use nw20 because like
further warm tones and then using the
brush I'm going to use this to work
underneath my eyes I always usually use
this into my eyes because it is quite
nice and brightening and it's also so
sort of steadfast and stubborn in terms
of getting off so you know that you've
got on to your eyes which is often
everyone's weakest point about circles
it means it's not gonna budge all day
when this brush I just literally buff it
into the skin and it's so nice I love it
I don't know where this brush has been
from my life and then when I did was I
went in with the Bobbi Brown corrector
in a light peach and just saw I use my
brush - twizel over-the-top kilobit
product and I just sort of rubbed it it
was hot then I like to set that all in
place with the hourglass ambient
lighting powder mines and if they rely
to the very lightest it's beautiful this
is so nice just blaring out any
infections or pores or anything like
that it just sets all in place and also
with that Mac Pro Longwear concealer
always better to set out because I found
the color if you don't set it it often
picks up all the colors on your face
throughout the day such as prompter
things and I used to find that I would
quite in the morning you look flawless I
didn't set it don't know why and then by
the end the day it almost looked Brown
because it was a bronzer or makeup would
mix into it and it just looked awful so
after I started setting it especially
with a white powder I this one it never
changed any more perfect this part that
are going with highlighting a contour
and on this occasion I use the Regents
cream
these are agents Queen bite and other
stories
if you don't you seen this but it's so
pretty it's just like a white cream that
on activation turns like a shimmery pink
so I use a soft cream on my eyes I think
splitting brush and I added it onto my
skin along by highlighting collection on
top of my cheekbones and then a little
bit underneath my eyebrows and so I'll
join the two together you see I'm pretty
famous and then I might same with
Illamasqua sculpting powder duo
it's beautiful highlighter and contour
and they both beautiful beautiful
products so pulling in the genes found
that cheek Hollow
I don't follow it and then you know the
sides of the face of temples and on to
the side again this is first few for
glamorous looks I kind of went above and
beyond that it came to doing the contour
as the contour shades been done I then
used my new favorite bronzer absolutely
do all this pran say it's a soap &amp;amp; Glory
solar powder do you so much for already
its kind of bronzer the highlight the
highlight isn't too shimmery though so
it I get away with this is a massive
bronzer and I use that on my Real
Techniques powder brush all over its go
ahead again just make sure it's all
totally run a little bit down since my
nose okay over these make sure they're
all nice a blended and then all the neck
immense mature is perfect to go back
with your foundation brush and just go
up the contour line to make sure that's
perfectly in place and I have been
loving the benefits browsing this is a
medium now I could probably use and
slightly lighter shades but this is the
one I got and this is the one that I
love I do like having me
so I went for the medium shade looks
like this and I also recently treat
myself to the Bobbi Brown this is the
eye definer I use it for my eyebrows and
it is brilliant it's so sort of stiff so
it really works in so I'm just going to
take the wax side I do the inner side
first gonna put it around down into
point and I'll go back with the wax so
to brush up in the front
then you go back with the actual powder
shade you draw back over that wax to
plug that into a color
this approach is just amazing I cannot
recommend this brushing mod now the wax
will keep this in place all day but if
you wanted to you could go back over
them with a brow gel so I love a the
bodyshop eyebrow gel or the benefit
gimme brow which is amazing so I might
add just a little by that
well okay so this point it started with
my forum new Sigma this is the eyeshadow
base and it's in persuade lovely
champagne color and why I did what this
is I use my Real Techniques shading
brush and added some of the product this
where it's a similar way to the Mac
Paint Pots and it creates a beautiful
beautiful vibrant base eyeshadow and
added dirt all over the lid onto my
crease as well and into the very inner
corner it's it's ledge of the perfect
champagne makes you ask me as I was
gonna quickly add some Carmack's
I'm going to make my new brushes to on
seven brush and my new Sigma diffuse
crease a 38 brush I'm leaving that I did
this I went with two different palettes
I use the Naked 2 by urban decay I use
the body shop this is the eye color eye
palette and smoky plum now this is for
Christmas and they known to have this so
I feel like there's no real point we
have showing you I did this so instead I
know I can make a similar fact with this
one so we're gonna do it all later to
start off with I'm going to you use
boutique haul which this off light shade
go the top of the light champagne we've
already decided so I'm gonna burn it in
a very inner corner I know the first
half the eye I'm going to use chopper
which is this kind of lovely bronzy gold
shade just it next to it over the center
of the lid it's not more of a shimmery
deeper color it's cool just here now
this is very very sparkly and they'll be
a lot drop off so be careful to wipe off
your brush and I'm gonna use this
through the crease and the very outer
corners
I'm going to use this even dark color
it's called busted here on the end it's
going to go over the very outer corner
really dark right now at this stage it's
a gun blend so nice fresh brush on the
side often eyeliner really dark
eyeliners can read they can take away
from it so instead I used a powder so I
used black out again from this palette
so you fake 6 shades from this palette
so I use my body shop sauntered brush
into the black which is a must a 1 / 2 /
shimmery and I just worked that along
yeah eyelashes this brush is really good
at it can create because it's so flat
you can create perfect winged I just
start pressing it onto the eye
so then what I did was just to use a
pair of eyelash curlers what I did on
the actual evening of when I did this
makeup was so I added some ardell demi
whispies no Demi Pixies I'll leave that
to all ensemble oh I think it's Demi
Pixies beautiful beef our shears now I'd
love to put these on again free show
exact look but I accidentally slept with
my makeup on that night because I had a
very good time and then in the morning
one of them was crushed and quite like
the same so it should have done so and
we have to rebuy those but they're by
far my favorite lashes and actually
might get about three boxes next time I
buy some because I don't really ever
want to use any other washed shirts
anymore if I was going to put those on I
wouldn't really kill mash as much
because I'm just going to do the mascara
this look today for you I'm just going
to use I'm gonna kill them and then you
see I comb
black magic skaara which is my favorite
mascara right now
I have done and then you sort of very
kind of light colors on the cheeks
nothing too much because office it's all
about the eyes really so and I use the
body shop on the one cheek color this is
in ginger apparently
later on the Real Techniques blush brush
has the smallest amount to achieve looks
sort of the hair I went to see Umberto
Geneva sell-on that's in the new Harvey
Nichols in Manchester and they did a
beautiful do for me where they can't
curled everything all back of my hair
and then they pulled two bits to the
back twisted them and then added the men
and all the rest was coming down in
curls and it was absolutely beautiful
and again you can see that on my blog so
that is the finished look
