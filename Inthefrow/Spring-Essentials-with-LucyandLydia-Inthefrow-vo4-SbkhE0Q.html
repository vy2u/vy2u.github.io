favorite ladies in Lydia I'm sure you
already know who they are what they're
amazing so they have joined me here on
in the fro today we're going to be doing
our five top spring essential items so
the things that we think you will need
or we are going to be needing for spring
so we've got some fashion we've got some
things at least yes relax yeah look all
our favorite things that we're going to
be using and loving for spring should we
get right into it okay so the first
thing I'm going to be showing you is a
top which I got from River Island and I
just think this is so pretty for spring
it's also got like a pizza pan collar
yeah it's a lovely material isn't quite
in bay I just love it because got a
really pretty floral pattern on it and I
love this really ons you know like that
really pretty and also I like things if
you've been on our channel before I like
things they've got a sleeve and this
kind of goes from about three-quarter
length so I think that's pretty pretty
and I think if you wear like a really
nice embellished necklace on today with
a pistol make up a theme and look pretty
nice I'm gonna wear this when we go to
these land Paris I think you look really
pretty yellow so yeah that's my fashion
favorite okay okay so my my piece when I
was thinking about my spring essentials
offers quite a lot of things that I
would have comment about cashews one so
I've gone with this white blouse sorry
Lydia thing a white shirt goes with
everything
so jeans on a bit of a call today you
can wear it with a lovely pair right
ankle grazier trousers in like a pink
dusty pink or a navy or even a black or
a gray I feel like can dress it up with
heels I can dress it down with trainers
one is from a brand called hazy I'm not
sure if you can still get it so they get
it about six months ago but while I'll
try and do is leave loads of links down
below of shirt similar that I really
really like so if you like the idea you
can go to find one but I just thought it
was really cute and it like you said you
can work short so these actually yeah
this is not quite a nice shape to it so
that wing and it's all
a really long dropped hem - this has a
bit more shape I love your shirt which
is a dip hem yeah it does it has a bit
more detail to it doesn't it
I really like that for spring I'm now
going to mention something which I am in
love with and it's baby pink color with
sort this Mickey no go on it and also
Mickey Mouse on the bag back is
definitely the best thing yeah not so
cute I just love pastel colors for
spring and for me Disney this year has
been spring so I had to mention this
then that can go with everything my sure
yeah jeans and then a favorite of mine
has been this bag from Primark and they
actually do it very similar stars this
new look in Primark I think I do in I
saw it the other day in black but I
didn't see in blue but you might get in
blue in your store sort of like a
Primark near where you are it's really
nice as well because you can wear it
I'll show you inside I always like a bag
as well that's got a zip inside so you
can hold your phone yes in there ah it's
nice because you can wear it in two
different ways you've got a longer strap
and then you can also hold it in the
crook of your arm so I think this is
really nice and I think it's big enough
so if you wanted to take it shopping it
would for everything kit but it's not
too bold yeah I mean it's a really good
sir any thanks blue I've got so much
wear out of it every year I've seen you
wear that so more so my accessory so if
you've been checking out Milan Fashion
Week updates and everything I've been
wearing from in Fashion Week last week
you might have seen this bag already
this is from a brand called strawberry
of Scotland
they're very up-and-coming brand I think
they make the most beautiful leather
bags the thing I like the most about it
is this gold bar that tucks over the
strap and then you can get into the barn
I think you would definitely fit like a
13 inch map I think so always thinking
of the gadget beautiful and this is all
suede lined and this also just come with
snaps - so you can wear em it's a little
satchel bag sward your pants its door an
investment piece but I have a coat
our code where you can get 10% off if
you use the code in the fro 10 that'll
get you 10% off so you'll get you'll
save yourself 40 pound on it and this
and there are so smaller ones as well
which I let they're cheaper my bag is
definitely lot heavier than everyone
else a casual em slouchy rucksack and
it's like this peachy pink shade of rose
gold detailing and you can fit a lot in
here there's a lot in this lab you can
see the line eh what's up 20 I think the
mist bag was 25 pound if not I think
everything yeah we bought in the we've
also last week actually in the Oxford
Street new look so my last fashion item
is something that I think I've tweeted
about snapchat food Instagram have worn
a lot everything else but you can do on
social media and it's this really pretty
it's a pink again there's a theme going
on you know it's baby pink but I've got
this baby pink coat and this is actually
from River Island I love this coat
because it's kind of like a boyfriend
style Co so it kind of goes outwards
quite a more of a cait so yeah but then
I think that actually makes your legs
look smaller so that's why I think code
there's my box seat there make sure they
are slimmer okay okay so my or the kind
of fashion ex3 are my new sunglasses for
spring/summer these will be amazing I
just love them guys but I just love them
these are Prada
they you know I don't know what model
the art but I'll leave the model below I
do have a link for them but even if you
don't want to afford products I think
these are about 180 209 pounds that my
pricey but if you don't prouder
the point is more surrounded sunglass
kind of shame that's kind of what I'm
recommending now for me I'm definitely
not a trainer girl I'm not my gosh your
girl Tina be casual even video I think
spring is all about more of the casual
look and it's the white high-top
converse allstar trainers and I just
love them I also like to wear them in
spring/summer time and I just think they
make your outfit look a lot cooler yeah
they think they look really cute and
you've got like pretty socks yeah in a
pastel theme so now we're going to be
moving on to beauty items for spring my
first spring pick is actually a cream
blusher and this is my NYX and it's the
cream blush in boho chic and I wrote on
my cheeks today I just think it gives a
really injury yeah I love all those
tricks and it's it's really lightly on
the skin it's really easy spend I just
use you don't wear on your lips you know
I would have thought that was a little
bit darker at the time but that's so
cool I like about it is that you can
really build up because you're quite
fair like a sometimes cream blushes if
you and kind of have to buff in quite a
lot but this you can really build up as
much as you want to give you
well you mood ups give you more of flush
if you want to but I love this because
it's very similar to the color of my si
daughter tees blush oh yeah love it and
I need to stop using that because I
can't get another one ever again so I'm
using this at the moment by finding
spring I just prefer more of a cream
blush or like a gooey look to the sheen
yeah me too and I find the cream sit
best from the skin okay so maybe two
picks as far is the new pitcher and
Ralph little bit I think you've gotta
love en Rose you know and this is her
very newest one with the M rose I mean
it still got a very candy smell and you
like the same sort of sense as me yeah
really case separatism always maintained
a bit more springy and almost love it
citrusy to this music fruity compared to
the original yeah it's not quite as
candy into everyone so I think to spring
this is going to be my spring go to
perfume and to my spring pick is
definitely the matte lipstick in pink
pal pop and I find it no already told
father no they don't
this needs to be talked about a lot but
you know it doesn't go then what if it
sells out oh yeah and I love this
lipstick you can see I love it very much
because I'm gone and I just love the
finish that the slips it gives it gives
a more creamy but glossy finish to my
lips and it is the perfect shade of pink
blue tones my funds we've got blue eyes
it makes your eyes family yeah and
lastly we have nail polishes now I'm
just going to grab on because I have
quite a few I'm wearing them all my
nails today and they oh and these are
the speedy quick dry nail polishes from
Barry M I've always been obsessed a
barrier now brushes I love the Joey hi
shiny hair really good they paint
amazingly these are the quick dry ones
and I just love the colors they're
really cute and spring-like and rate
skills delay it gave me the government
passel team and this is just with two
coats so they paint amazingly it looks
so cute yeah I think my favorite colors
are probably this greeny shade that is
called pole position and then I also
love kiss me quick which is like a baby
pink color I also have a nail polish
actually I think for me this spring
summer is going to be about kind of nude
manicured nails yeah I really like the
kind of very yeah and actually that's
kind of like your nails but better with
white tips so I have this one here this
is from Lancome well at Palace is in
three four seven B I will leave it down
below when I find out the actual shade
but it's like it's one of those
it's one of those really light
hey lovely almost sheer wash of course I
can more like light when you do yeah
yeah so it all just in it does enhances
your natural nail color makes a little
bit more pretty pink and then what I
often do is get on those nails like
white in their hands I do that and then
I'll add a topcoat over my last spring
pick is going to be a highlighter and
probably for the last month I've been
obsessed with this highlighter I
actually used it in our recent makeup
Taylor Swift
it just gives my cheeks it's really
beautiful but natural highlight I fight
and it gives my cheeks more of a Joey
highlight rather the pouty highlight and
it's the Topshop glow stick this is
because it's so easy to blend and it
doesn't interrupt Chopra nation knows
I'm with Cree takes them off oh yeah and
I find a lot of that I light is a
two-room for a skin tone where is this
one yeah I think it's just in one shade
actually just the glows yeah let us know

essentials are for spring I'm just in
