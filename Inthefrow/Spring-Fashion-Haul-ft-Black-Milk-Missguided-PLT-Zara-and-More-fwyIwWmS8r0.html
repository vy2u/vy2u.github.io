probably means I've got another hole to
show you so I got on with it
first of all I wearing this new bodysuit
it's from the nicole scherzinger range I
know that my last hole I showed you
about foreign things I had got from the
range but I decided to get this as well
because I really liked it online and
it's a black body suit with a white mesh
panel that's in white top some black
high neck and it's office it's got a
soft box at the bottom so you can open
it up so you have to always be taking
off and on if you don't want to stop
really nice a tightly fitted and I'm
just pairing it with a pair of denim
shorts you can tell I'm getting the kind
of summery springy mood at the moment
and things from the sky as their crema
trousers and this really kind of almost
like tracksuit bottom a cereal but it
makes them super comfy and soft ordinary
kind of leg length rusticated waist nice
little tie so they're just super
wearable super nice we're so comfortable
and wearing us to work really really
like those I think those are 25 pounds I
got some bralette sis WAN
first of all and a mint color if it's
really beautifully you can wear it
really nicely under shirts and blouses
it's kind of an underwear kind of look
piece or you can wear it with a pair of
denim shorts was somewhere in the spring
or festivals and if you cute little top
to wear I think that's 10 pounds and
then I also got it in because again
black coats is everything your seem to
mess up bralette and these are so
flattering and so nicely fitted so I got
those that's another ten pounds so I got
these from pretty little thing I kind of
a mint Jean jackin kind of material two
pockets on the back it's really kind of
flattering Jean if you want something
Canada's spring colors passive colors
for the summer and they're just fit
really really nicely and I think if I
also get these in the pink color as well
and I think those are 25 pounds I'm off
with Bryce's but I'll leave all the
links for everything down below so you
can go and have a look yourself
something I got from Zara I really love
Zara
Geron the kind of on-trend pieces and
got this oversized kind of jumper style
top very kind of thin knit and it goes
into this kind of silky satiny white
fabric through the center but over again
so became a brawler or even just a kind
of plain bra it just has a really really
lovely effect and it kind of pulls in
the bottom as well so it's not too
oversized looking and that's 20 pounds
so really love that this is for a brand
called hazy London and this was from
spoiled brats Koike like a live link
below satiny feel fabric get on there
what you would describe that as but
really lightweight fabric so it hangs
really beautifully longer at the back
I'm sure to the front nice little
utility pockets very nice little collar
and it's almost like a batwing effect
sleeve that goes into his little costs
but it's just really really fast going
on you might was so much over shorts
kind of front tucked in the back hanging
out it all took seeing like our jeans so
it's pretty multifunctional and I really
really like that and I think that about
50 pounds I'll leave links a look and
this next one I got from a spotlight
range from warehouse really stunning
little coral orangie dress below kind of
neckline and sit back but it's got this
kind of jeweled fabric in it it's kind
of new fabric layered with the coral
over the top with this come in kind of
like the holes I mean cuz how and
embroidered through that's a kind of to
turn affecting the colors and this
really kind of beautiful almost reminds
with seashells or something they're not
the front it's really really beautiful I
think that is all I can tell you that is
70 pounds so that's really really pretty
for a date night or really nice event
you don't see maybe like a wedding I got
this at the Black Milk
burned velvet go-go dress a little mini
dress
in a beautiful then velvet fabric where
you can see it but it's so beautiful it
looks like development that's been
pressed and burnt and this beautiful
kind of Barak print high-neck it's got a
cutout in the back what's up keyhole in
the back and it just so beautifully
fitted and I absolutely adore about
that's about it's hard looking out from
Austrian dance UK but I think that'll be
around 60 pounds now I'm a huge Game of
Thrones fan I've always been a fan ever
since the start of the show came out and
I think it's an amazing show you know if
you don't watch Game of Thrones you
really should be but anyway black belt
did the Game of Thrones range as I
mentioned so I got this a little scare
scare and it's in the idea I think it's
kinda looks like dragon scales well
because this is so a lot of people color
in the print of it it would go with
still the little basics I crapped a long
sleeve tops cropped tanks it would go
with things like this bodysuit for
example oh there was so so much and
because it sort of skates down that's
not gonna ride up like some of that
milks gets used to do I found and it's
just like a really really cute piece so
I think I'm gonna start wearing this
every time game thrills his arm and
awesome start wearing out as well but
it's really really cute for the summer
and I think that'll be around 40 pounds
um then I got a sweat I'm at the massive
some sweats when they kind of can go
with anything so this is perfect for
that realer this is from pitbull in and
you can get this at a sauce
it's kind of an off-white cream ivory
and it's kind of a scuba fabric neoprene
fabric with this kind of quilted
geometric effect on the front so I've
been wearing this in over like jeans
leggings go with everything and it's not
too heavy it's not the thickest scuba
fabric I've ever tried so it's not gonna
be too heavy
from summer it's just really really cute
little piece like 65 pounds from our
clothing I got this two-piece and it's
in a blue and white check bingum
print little crop and that comes with
the little blue skirt as well so they go
to gathering a lot set the skirt is
$15.99 and topless ish nice nice so
about stepping back 30 pounds 32 pounds
little Co on set but that's a really
really cute for the spring look then
from a brand called red label I got this
dress
cute look kind of Swing skater dress
almost with MIDI sleeves as they pull
the back but the trend is just really
really cool and it's kind of royal blue
neon pink and neon green you sell
flowers all over it so that we're really
cute for work and just wearing around in
the summer with a pair of sandals yeah I
love that and I think that was 25 pounds
from the red label okay and then finally
from a brand called Stella calm they're
from Australia I got some really
beautiful things at the moment
Australian companies doing such amazing
things so these are from Stella it's
first of all this little play suit how
beautiful the colors in this such
gorgeous kind of vibrant floral print it
cuts out through the back so it goes
across the back to put it simple payout
and it zip down the shops hi next shift
style and it's just absolute gorgeous
again it's a really soft thick you can
kind of hear sound it kind of makes I
kind of think of fabric so you're not
gonna really show anything front it's
also got it's kind of draped kind of
skirt area so it almost makes it look
like you're wearing a little dress which
is really cute so that's from Stella
calm that's $58 so that's probably
around 45 pound then from Stella I got
this dress it's just called the espresso
dress I just love the colors and the
print is just really really cool and
really kind of vibrant and and it zips
up the back singing it into that
shifts style gangs are perfect for
summer really sandals or you want a soft
Salus up for a night out the birth bet
with pair of little kind of white
stilettos or I'll cream our beige wedges
so a love that and that is $40 last but
not least from steli is this little
cream crochet style bralette this is $35
I think so probably again around 25
pounds maybe but this will be so
beautiful for summer again with pair of
denim shorts they'll be good to go with
pair of sandals with jeans or again with
beautiful here wear underneath kind of a
sheer blouse to kind of show through the
pattern that you can see inside it but
again it kind of really thick really
lovely material it's really kind of
worth the money it's beautiful and
that's it's got the kind of bra strap so
you can make it short or long if you
like to as well so that's one of my
favorite things recently now I think
that's everything I always worry each
time I do this I've missed something but
I need to show you again but no doubt
put it in my next file that I do my next
video without putting our movie and
accessories haul because I've got so
many accessories and shoes and bags and
