video but so many things to show you so
I'm really bad gone with it I'm gonna
start off it's jumper from wild fox it
is the softest fleece East fabric I've
ever had for jumpers I'll leave all
links down below for all these products
by the way other prices but I think this
is around 110 pounds but the fabric is
beautiful and it's wild fox so that's
what the price tag is I was searching
for pair of faux leather trousers now
for over a month because my last pair
from Topshop I wore to death and I'm
hitting a hole in the back pocket so and
I've just got these new leather look
trousers from lebra do as I say it Lara
do not read all that La Redoute well
they're so good - exactly well on to the
cash bag style they've got the kind of
ribbing effect on the knees and on the
inside the face black and almost like a
jersey panel and then no pockets on the
back but they fit like an absolute dream
and these size UK six and I sitting
there absolutely perfectly and I know
I'm catching it below the trousers and
laughs woohoo why not stay with the
leather faux leather theme and this
little beauty it's from Urban Outfitters
I am going over and outfits after really
I don't really go shopping in stores
that often like I need to get out more
thing but the other week I did and I saw
this little cutie hanging around this is
45 pound I don't know why the tag still
in it because I actually have wore on
this out for 5 pounds and it's really
lovely fair it's not too flared but then
it's also not body can't so it's not
always gonna be right enough
so yeah perfect little skirt for summer
and also like nice little evenings
outlook postal letter another jumper a
habits from drop dead
it's sort of like an ordinary length
jumper in this kind of large like holy
knit kind of effect and these big purple
unicorns on it so I mean I see myself as
a bit unicorn pink hair so this is going
to be perfect and I can't buy how much
this ears might be about 40 pounds again
I'll leave all the prices below I got a
couple of beautiful dresses and play
suits from oh my love London this little
play suit is absolutely adorable it's
got this really cute delicate lace on
the sleeves to make it cap sleeved and
also goes around the very bottom of the
shores but if you can see that it's
really really pretty and then it's all
v-neck low v-neck so we're really really
flattering on and because it's like
shorts at the back so that I love can't
wait to wear that out in the spring and
that is 35 pounds little one from my
love London it's gorgeous cobalt dress
again perfect for spring is so soft and
light and this this is their -
background so I forget to tell you and
soft gathers at the back like this and
it's got this large kind of gold feature
on the back I'll play see this is from
wall G it's not so from orgy though it's
from an actual brand but I feel all for
that cut remember name the brand I got
it from but again I'll link that below
and when you can get this wrong but it's
so nice and when this works perfect for
work because I'm a lecturer if it
happens at that floor and so I can wear
this with tights and some boots and it's
not too showy and it fits beautifully I
think that was around 30 pounds then
I've got some nice simple casual t-shirt
from daydream supply I've had one of
their maroon t-shirt for and I've worn
it absolute loads that's a lot of fit of
it so this is one of their new ones in
black cod Asian spy on the front and
then
it's got this cool like skeleton on the
back of daydream the game
I think that's 20 pounds and then
similarly I've also got their white tea
sets daydream Supply Company on the
front and on the back it says it even
bigger let's look at Co artists cuz I
live close right now this is from jaded
London Beyonce and Cara Delevingne have
both been seen recent we're engaged
which is so cool and if you go on a
change website I am on their lookbook a
model for their lookbook and then
wearing play set and apps just
absolutely adore it when I was wobbling
out I was like I really need this set
but it's just like a little cute crop
and a matching little skirt they fit
like a dream
the colors are just perfection will
actually a mix of my favorite colors I
am one and they go together so
beautifully I think these are around I
think this is forty pounds it's about
thirty pounds but as a set that
absolutely stunning
the next pair of cords I got these
actually beauties from misguided this is
in a pink and white houndstooth and it
comes with the asymmetric skirt well
seriously how cute is that
baby Pink's I just I like pink and that
we saw we're gonna be cold shares and
get my Skyler collection came out I'm a
baking cool fan I think she's just
absolutely stunning and she sort of
established a proper kind of powerful
women strong women so I very much
brought into the collection so I got
this gem which she softwares and a lot
of the videos it's gorgeous
quite soft wide neck long sleeved and
then it has these cutouts on the very
sides hope your fans which is just it
like this it doesn't look like a look at
that flattering but it's really really
gorgeous absolutely beautiful and I
think that was 45 pounds but this one
has been selling out super fast because
it's just such a cool piece
so I have door backs another piece that
I got was see black dress high neck
those two mesh sides and crossover on
the back and then if you can see that
low back that goes up with zips you can
save yourself into it we've got all your
back exposed and it's like this now some
people might think okay well how is this
going to cover you if you cannot go back
I wore this to an event recently and I
just wore a strapless black bra with it
it was a really sort of thick black
strap around the back and it looked like
it was part of the dress so then I could
wear a bra I wouldn't feel worried that
I was got to be showing anything and it
does look like a dress so that works
really really well again this is about
40 pounds quite a long and beautiful
just it'll go with so much and never
fade from the collection was this little
mini dress it's got the faux leather on
the bottom faux leather up here on the
top for the neckline and pop of acting
it into it but it just fits like a dream
and it's absolutely beautiful and I
think that's about 35 last piece I got
from the collection was this well that's
what crap it's like a faux leather crop
I think this was around 25 pounds if it
was all the way down to the back just
somewhere this all looks so cute the
pair of my denim shorts made some little
heels or you could kind of dress it down
make it quite casual I really really
like that my absolute favorite brands
actually at the moment it's a brand that
you may not have heard of but you should
have heard of and they're called
Wonderland clothing so I got a few
things from there including this little
bralette which is so beautiful it's got
it's gorgeous kind of neon floral
paradise kind of print on it and it's so
so pretty meaning for summer with some
shorts it's a look
gorgeous but that is technically from
South skirt but from wonderland clothing
so you've got to check them out and also
from what my clothing is this gorgeous
little cutout dress against a bow skirt
if you can get it from one leg clothing
for about 45 to 50 pounds gorgeous have
to cut out this kind of neon Aztec print
and then it kind of cuts out this little
kind of daisies in the center and into a
little skater skirt so nice so so cute
so you really need to check out that
Brown because that's a little of it I've
also got this from Miss Selfridge again
I barely ever go into Miss Selfridge but
I wouldn't marry you something picked up
a slot Cummings I mean like the print
and again I thought they keep so cute
just tucked into pair of leather
trousers that leather skirt that I've
got from Urban Outfitters awesome shorts
and that was around 25 pounds this is
from Wonder Bra and this is their new
collection Incorporation Basso and Brook
and it's to Sue's go just kind of rock
print super smooth lustrous fabric and
goes around the back like these it's so
so nice and I think that'll probably be
around 35 to 40 pounds shout out to this
I'm wearing this is a playsuit scott not
like george goes into a scoffs butter
wise it's a little play suit and I've
just added a misguided belt that I like
to it just add a little bit more detail
if you're wondering I am wearing my
extensions my cheeky cheeky hair
extensions and they are a turn too dark
for my hair if you watched my last video
about my hair care routine you'll see
how I mentioned about coloring them and
and things like that but I just really
really love the two-tone effect that it
gives so I thought I'd carry I'm wearing
them finally just a few bits of jewelry
Delilah dose one of my favorite jewelry
brands at the moment they're things they
stock the energy eautiful so got this
really pretty a drusy necklace long
necklace a host about here
it's in white cream drusy on silver
useful little bracelet with kind of
little drusy stone gain and we're in
this most days absolutely love that and
then I've also got this it's not as well
in a dark purple which is stunning a
gold chain bit shorter gold chain one
and this is stunning gray blue almost
lilac II Oh Lana Keystone and that's
that's a nasty lion dust and then I've
also got a few things from drusy dreams

gem in the center it's such a lovely
little statement necklace also this big
