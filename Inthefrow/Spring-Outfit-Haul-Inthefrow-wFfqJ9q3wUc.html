excited to film today because finally
I'm bringing fashion back to this
YouTube channel I'm so sorry to everyone
that officers subscribed because he
enjoyed my fashion and my style my
pistol style and what I like to wear and
how I wore it I've just not had as much
time unfortunately it's kind of put
fashion pieces together in styling
outfits and look books and hauls I've
just not had as much time with moving
and all that but enough of the excuses
it's finally here I have so many new
things to show you so in that case this
is almost a whole flash lookbook slash
outfit inspiration video and I really
hope you enjoy it I'm going to make a
start with one piece I don't actually
Ward out yet because I'm saving it for
Fashion Week actually and it's a piece I
saw on the Topshop website and it's a
pair of butter not coops so it's almost
like a jumpsuit that goes down all the
way into collapse at the bottom the nice
feature about this jumpsuit though is
this cutout back so I'm like a
triangular shape cut out back but your
bra is still covered which is quite nice
but it's so cool and such a kind of
statement piece I want the clots with
these beautiful new her live aguar heels
we might seen in my last favorites video
actually I think it was I'm just loving
things for wearing with black outfits
just add a bit more of a chic stylish
element to them so I wore those finish
off the outfit with this lovely khaki
green trench coat it's a mini length
trench coat we're out from being all the
way to the floor and being a little bit
too much into heavy for the outset but I
just thought it was quite a casual and
cool piece to wear up at the top and I
love the color combination so that is
from glamorous moving on to outfit
number two and these are two pieces from
let's see that picture recently
first being a really lovely MIDI black
dress in a quite in lustrous and
elastane fabrics it's quite a lot of
stretch to this and it's also ripped but
I really liked the sort of high neck
turtleneck style
to it and they cropped through quarter
length sleeves and it just fits in all
the right places for really really like
that and I wore that with a literacy
jacket this gorgeous little sheepskin
style pink biker jacket aviator jacket
with lovely sheepskin costs and
sheepskin against the inside it won't be
sheepskin because it would be a lot more
expensive but it's that kind of faux
sheepskin so it's a shilling fabric
inside so it's super warm especially
with this almost faux leather outing as
well and it's got a great structure to
it so I thought they will look this
together
I also are them with a new pair of boots
from next I might have shown you these
before I'm not sure but I'm really easy
to wear comfortable pair boots from next
and I'm also wearing a pair of shades
from Ray Bans
in club masters in black with gold
hardware which I absolutely love at the
moment so are those as well okay outfit
three so first of all so I built this
outfit around this particular item these
are from misguided and they're a very
dull dusky pink pair of cigarette
trousers top ankle grazer lengths and
all those with this top that I also got
from Topshop with short sleeves a ribbed
effect it's very very similar to the
dress actually from the whip suit but
this time in a ordinary t-shirt length
so you can tuck it into everything so
far it would go perfectly with those
trousers so I really really like those
together just to keep a little bit more
casual I also styled it with a pair of
flat shoes and I went for these box
either from Shelley is really lovely
style actually the way it goes quite
high up at the back put this little
toggle there a wool gray out to body
black piping and white rubber soles but
the quiet casual shoe and I thought it
would just make it a little bit more
casual and if something just to throw
the top of those I went for this jacket
which I've done a blog post on recently
and it says black and white paint effect
jacket duster jacket really
this is from girls on film from little
mistress car it's a PC - I was so much
because it's black and white so it will
go with most things I thought it looked
really really love with this outfit
outfit 5 it's very very monochrome I
went very much for the black colors this
time so I went for this little wipsy
desktop just very casual basic easy to
style it's a kind of things that you
could just do with having any wardrobe
for the days when you have a lot of
arouses our new pair of jeans and you
just want a little black cami so it's a
little bit kind from lip seat with a
ruching effect to the center a wallet
with a new pair of jeans really cool
very heavy ripped jeans over the top of
that one I might even taking a label out
of this yet but it's another duster
jacket this time in a black and white
checkerboard print it's a MIDI length
again quite a long length kind of half
three-quarter length sleeves and very
confirm easy to throw on fabric but I
thought it would go really well with
this black out but it's not a bit of
white a bit of kind of brightness to it
and I was really chic so I like that a
lot and to go with those I what matched
it with my gorgeous Alexander Wang boots
I don't wear these enough I should wear
them more because they're out so
stunning with the rose gold inside I'm
pretty sure you can still get me I'll
try and leave obviously there'll be
links to every single product from these
down below where you can go and buy them
if you like them I'll try and find links
for these and an extra little accessory
just to give that up a little bit
I wore this little bug clip little bow
and it's got some hair grips in the back
so you let's just push it in to every
wearing like this it's not for everyone
but I thought it would just make a
little bit more feminine and just a bit
cutesy and another top so it is very
like anything else I own but I really
like the colors in it and I like the
shape so I went for it and it fits from
brat and Suzy really cool foot print and
again I really like this neck because
it's not it's quite a wide neck so I
really like that style with the little
cuff to sleeves as well so remote files
really really cute the next outfit works
around this black dress black and white
check board print dress from River
Island
again it's a MIDI style which is my
favorite kind of dressed at the moment
because it means it can go with my
favorite type of boots which currently
are over knee boots and these again are
from River Island around 70 pounds buy
these but they are a type of suede
fabric ordinary kind of rubber soles and
they're quite comfortable as well
so I've been loving these types of boots
so MIDI dresses have been my thing so
that's why I really really like this
dress from River Island I know the top
of that I really have to put it with
this stunning rain Mac this is from
round cold rains front is it one with
brand-new prints and it's a white snake
print reptile print but up close it's
absolutely stunning and rains make the
most waterproof incredible jackets they
are such volume on it but I'd also show
you my other one that I also have which
is in the gorgeous sunshine sunflower
yellow if you wanted something a little
bit different some of you may have
spotted this jacket in zoe ellis recent
lookbook that she did when she was out
and about and she was wearing this and
she looks so cute and i have it as well
so i thought to show you that as well in
case you're after it's a little bit
brighter for the spring storm especially
the festival season these are a go to
next outfit was built around another
product from Topshop and sixty pounds to
start with and it's this gray almost
lavender gray blue jumpsuit it has a
wrap over effect so yes you do need to
wear quite a low brow with this or no
bra if you're brave enough but I would
say maybe a low bra and also perhaps
possibly pin it as well because you are
going to get this gaping as you just
generally move around actually stunning
and I cannot wait to wear to the London
Fashion Week and this is another piece
that I bought fallen rush week as I
thought it'd be a lovely statement coat
and it's this textured slouchy oversized
estas coat in a lovely bright snow white
no buttons it's just a wrap over jacket
it's kind of thing that you could just
drink off your shoulders
super chic in it and to go with the sort
of blue gray theme that was running
through the jumpsuit I paired it with my
gorgeous Ted Baker heels and last but
certainly not least is a very fun outfit
which was supposed built around this
skirt which is from referral again it's
got a gold zip all the way up the back
and it fits as a fitted pencil skirt
body con style I paired that with this
no back and very sexy body suit from
misguided it'll it should just have
straps that you put over the back of you
know bra clips completely backless and
over the top and I wore this amazing
Cameco I got this in a size 8 size six
probably would have been a little bit
better but I've got a feeling they
didn't do a size six but it's meant to
have that oversized feel but if you want
to kind of think about what size you
need this is a size eight and again to
finish that off I put that with my pull
effect of our heels every other way if
you're wondering I'm wearing Mac's rebel
on my lips and this is my new Tori back
and dress that is just I love it
and if you're wondering what watch I was
wearing throughout the whole thing it's
my Daniel Wellington Boston no Bristol
watch Bristol watch in the rose gold and
brown strap I really really hope you
enjoyed that and I really hope it
inspired some of your own new style for
the new season please let me know in the
comments which your favorite outfit was
out of all of those
I still cut makeup on which is my
favorite probably easy gray jumpsuit
because I really really love that
jumpsuit but let me know which is your
favorite if you really liked the videos
and do give it a like and subscribe if
you're new and in that case I'll see you
in my next one
bye what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
