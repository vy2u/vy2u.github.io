hole so I've got lots of new products to
show you this week I thought I would
have a change in that instead of holding
up things and showing me wearing them I
would instead talk you through my
outfits as I'm wearing them so I'm going
to show you all the different outfits
and I'm going to talk you through all
the different pieces in the outfit seen
yet that's an idea
and as always everything that I'm
wearing will be linked down below with
direct links straight to the outfits
unless I can't find the particular piece
but hopefully I can really hope you like
this kind of format instead give me a
thumbs up if you do yeah really really
hope you enjoy it see see okay so to
start off with this a sauce boxy
powder-blue top that I've paired with
these trousers which are sewn fashion
Union and the flat forms in black which
are also from fashion Union really
casual comfortable outfit for the summer
very lightweight you're not going to get
too hot in this but it's really nice
sort of shapes in the boxy sleeves and
the oversized effect this is a new black
German see that I have got recently this
is from River Island from ASOS and I'm
wearing it with some very similar
loafers in black and white those are
from personal
and I'm decided to put this beautiful
neon glaze over there this is from Miss
Selfridge and I know it's very very
bright but I deal with a pop of color
now and again when you're wearing
monochrome so I love this so this is
from little mistress a snake print
multicolored dress with a high neck and
back that's a race style and these are
miss guided heals the body heals in
white and black with a see-through toe
as just a nice effect to the shoes this
is a really festival inspired outfit
with this kimono from a local designer
Carmela succumbed each to some beautiful
items and I've paired that with these
pretty little things black shorts with
black leather pockets and this little
cream crop from Stella Duncan now this
tote is from pink Oh in their leather
range and it's so beautiful and perfect
for this kind of occasion and I've worn
them with my pretty little thing white
and flat forms
this dress is from fashion media and I
love the inserts around the legs and the
waist just to add another dimension to
it otherwise cotton style dress really
this is a poor boutiques clutch and I
love this it's reversible so can be
orange or Navy and I've styled that with
my misguided beige wedges again which I
does love for most Madras moment the so
versatile and such a beautiful
color another very holiday and Beach out
for you these are both from leech cafe
the jnana crochet cast on and they blue
bikini this is from Melissa Oh - gained
but it's the most beautiful blue and
white effect and it's my favorite bikini
for the summer this skirt is adorable
this is from ASOS
any powder blue wrap over effect I
paired that with a pair of art clothing
jealousy's and this callus cells from
she inside with a big tiger print emblem
to the very very front
I love this Co on set this is from
little mistress it's Anna nude and beige
shade fully in lace back of the crop top
isn't a little a sequin see a bra
through that and it's a miniskirt that
is covered over by a longer midi lace
it's such a beautiful shade and such a
beautiful flattering shape and I just
paired that with my new Louboutin shoes
as well
this pink playsuit is from in love with
fashion the bottom of the shorts almost
gives a tulip stout effect it's really
really pretty and really flattering
so I've styled that with my river island
heels which are sold out but they seem
to be coming back now for the summer and
also my Marc by Marc Jacobs holographic
purse which I just adore recently is so
cute this is another kind of festival
casual outfit with a pair of pink mum
shorts from pretty little thing with my
navy blue vans and a misguided black
bralette just for very casual and
comfortable outfits on
and here I'm throwing down at my
brand-new anorak coat this is from dry
star and it's an acute it's baby blue
and I could not recommend this enough if
you're going away for any festivals this
year it is so perfect I had to show you
this this is my favorite dress off the
moment this is my baby pink Miss
Selfridge PU leather lot dressing
color-block so the back is entirely
cream the front isn't beautiful very
pink and I just adore the shape and the
style of this it's beautiful just
wearing that with a pair of black boots
this is another very Beach and on
holidays by an outfit but this is
another Melissa Oda bash caftan in a
beautiful jade green style this is from
beach cafe and I'm wearing it over the
top of this stunning white mesh swimsuit
and again from Beach Cafe this dress is
from sheer inside and it is such a
princess dress I couldn't wear a bra
with it because of the style of the
straps and it's quite low but if you're
quite brave and you're happy to wear it
without a Barton this is perfect
beautiful that entire low back I will
again have worn this with my Miss
Selfridge wedges of thought cause when
we legs together and I've paired it with
my
announcer extra dimension and flash of
color to the outside
this is another very beachy alpha again
this is from beach cafe this dress is to
die for
I love it but this lace that comes over
the two sides
it's stunning such a beautiful
flattering shape there's the beach on a
night out everyone that with my Taylor
Morris sunglasses and the sea fall a bag
with these beautiful rope straps perfect
for carrying everything that you need to
the beach around who you on holiday is
the best size for that kind of thing and
I would wear that with these little
sandals again from the beach cafe this
is from little mistress with a lovely
scalloped waistline to really cinch you
in it's got a tutu just needs a skirt to
add a little bit height and it's another
shape the shift' style so flawless with
some Louboutins in nude I don't wear
these enough really

clutch which I take most of these kind
