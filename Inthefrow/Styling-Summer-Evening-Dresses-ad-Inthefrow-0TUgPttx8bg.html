fashion video I'm loving how much you
guys are really into my new fashion
videos recently so I'm trying to get a
lot more out there for you of course it
takes me quite a bit longer to film the
fashion videos but I really do enjoy
film and then I can tell that you guys
enjoy watching them so it's all good
I noticed recently that so many of you
loved one of my unboxing videos so I
wanted to kind of do something similar
to that format gained in the sort of
unboxing style while I try on the
outfits and show you the outfits and
whatnot it's going to be slightly
different this time this time I have
collaborated with it very exclusive and
they asked me to look through their
website to see if I could find a few
beautiful summer dresses and evening
dresses I could pair up with everything
else in my wardrobe the whole point of
this really is just to show you how
you're able to buy more expensive pieces
and more investment pieces and then fit
them with so many of the things in your
wardrobe so you don't need to go out and
buy a new jacket or new pair of shoes a
new bag you can spend a little bit more
on a new dress I don't go with
everything else at you oh just to give
you a bit of a backstory I'm very
exclusive
just in case not too familiar with the
brand it's a running store that just
opened recently and they are stocking so
many gorgeous products from so many
brands people have heard about like
Queen Karl Lagerfeld this pinko
Elizabeth James as fine as keeper so
many brands and grow it often they'll be
the diffusion lines of a very very
expensive luxury brands so you're able
to buy into your favorite brands at a
more affordable price which is really
really cool so I went onto the site and
picked out seven dresses that I thought
would work perfectly with a lot of other
things in my wardrobe just to show you
how you could style up some dresses for
your summer evenings so I'm going to go
through each product and what I've
paired it with and how you could wear it
so let's start with number one
we have this ppq cream label black wrap
play suit a little bit play so is that
sort of staple item you can have in your
war room for those days it's a little
bit more sunny but you still want to
look quite sophisticated chic in
westweek white black and put together
when I was thinking of outfits and what
I would put with
I want to go something quite cheap and
quite elegant so I decided to pair up
the play suit with these really gorgeous
heels these are from McQueen by
Alexander McQueen they've got this
really cool sort of ivory look heel on
they're not too high at all and they're
in amuel style so it's completely soft
open here it goes around your foot and
it's got a little strap on them as well
as these were black I thought they will
be perfect to accompany play suit so go
along with that as well I went with this
beautiful Elizabeth and James gold ring
in this crossover effect it's almost
like - sort of crossing each other over
the top and finish off the whole look I
went this restruck it and it's got a lot
of structure as well - it just down the
back there cause it's structured fact
and I also wore a pair of ray-bans the
baby bag aviators as well bear in mind
that every single thing that I wear in
this entire video it will be down below
in the description bar so go onto there
and have a look
okay so outfit - this is a shirt dress a
denim style shirt dress from pink oh and
it also has a red and white striped
waistband so it's a cinch as you in in
all the right places in the middle but I
thought with it being so warm now under
and it's only going to get warmer and
warmer towards summer I thought that
especially for me if I'm going to be
going out in the evenings for a drinks
or cocktails going out for meals and
what we wearing jackets too much and I
want to be wearing more bare legs and
just wearing things a bit cooler I'm not
quite a soft elegant all the time with
this I went for a pair of Christian
Louboutin heels and a nude they're the
garlic pumps 100 I also went for a red
bag that matched with the red through
the belt so that was a strawberry of
Scotland bag and because this is a kind
of look that I'll be wearing for my
evenings in the summer when I'm going
out for drinks and things like that I
wanted to wear fragrance with it it was
really bright fresh quite fruity so I
went with the else.we flight of Fatima
is it sweet and a sweet that's why if
like a fancy perfume it's really pretty
almost like
it is actually its little peacock with
that feathers around the top perfect
bottle of little box as well and I also
went for a really pretty lipstick this
is again from Anna Sui and it's in the
shade 303 and can't see a name on it the
thing about this lipstick goes oh it
looks like a star that's been pulled up
and twisted up so that you almost
applying a star shape onto lips so I
really really like that look it's more
casual but you can just kick it up a
notch with a pair of heels and take it
to an evening look okay so the third
outfit is from Finders Keepers and it's
this gorgeous pursuit dress it's called
tomorrow if I don't wear many florals
but I feel that for summer and spring
you've got to go for some floral dresses
and this was just too pretty to miss
this is amazing with a floral print all
over the top it also houses peplum
overhanging wrap around each side and it
creates an illusion of wider hips I feel
through your must look like you've got
more of a curve around your hip area
which is quite lovely and mini style and
it's got a cut to the back so it's quite
sexy as well but because of the
beautiful Pink's earning through the
dress I paired it with a pair of sari
and also I bought last year actually
little pair of pink heels there are so
many pastel pink shoes in the market oh
you'll definitely have to pick up some
super cheap if you don't have any and to
keep everything quite white and fresh I
paired it with a whistles bag with a
silver chain strap and this white snake
print style leather outfit for and
honestly I think this might be my
favorite but it's this black mini dress
from Elizabeth of James Elizabeth and
James is around by the Olsons and they
create some really classic shapes and
sophisticated styles and I'm just in
love with the entire collection but this
dress is such a classic sound but you've
got to wear for so many different
occasions where it's a date night or if
it's an event or party or anything like
that but a little bit more fabric around
the skirt to give more of an a-line
trippy shape to it which just adds to
the overall effect
of the entire dress so I wore this with
a full-length maxi sleeveless waistcoat
jacket that I got from lavish Alice that
I've been dying to wear with something
and this was a perfect choice I felt
it's a really lightweight fabric so it's
perfect for spring and summer
but it does also give the illusion that
you're wearing a jacket and you're quite
pulled in and tailored finish that off I
went with my Sophia Webster watermelon
quartz use that I'm sure you've seen
before I've mentioned quite a few times
but I'm absolutely in love with them I
really really like this outfit a lot and
I also wore a black bag and stress free
of Scotland this is the smallest one of
their little mini totes that they do and
again the a discount code just below for
you to go and have a little look at that
as well okay outfit 5 so this is a piece
from the McQueen by Alexander McQueen
collection and it's not something I
would usually choose but the moment are
really getting into wearing white shirts
as it's being especially sort of
sleeveless shirts so I quite like a look
at this when I saw it on the website
little bit more texture and detail at
how these eyelets and stood down the
front of both sections just adds a
little bit more detail to the outfit and
it's a little bit of wider at the bottom
so it's more of a trippy shape so I wore
a light weight base jacket with this
it's gonna sweat a faux suede material
also while my Perla Victoire heels and
my Fendi hands bagged a little bit more
black to this outfit and I finished it
off with my pair of new Ray Ban aviators
as well but outfit 6 I think this is
such a professional classy dress it's
the type of dress you could take to work
wear to work and then wear it out later
with pair of your favorite stilettos and
it will just take your look from date
tonight it's this color-block dress from
carbon this nearly comes down to your
knees so it's not too short so that's
why I said it would quite work
appropriate quite professional edge to
it is that up to the bat and also sips
down the side for you to get into there
quite easily it's a great bold cool
block style and will go with so many
types of jackets and types of shoes it's
quite a winner I think miss dress I wore
it with a pair of jean beatty Russy
court in the nude white as I felt like
the white would go really well with the
white through the dress and again I wore
my whistles bag in y2 and a pair of
sunglasses I didn't watch a kit with
this but you could quite easily wear a
trench coat or a long beige camel coat
for example and it would look really
stunning and outfit 7 it's a dress I'm
wearing right now I'm in love with this
I don't really want to take it off
that's why I've got it on now and this
is a dress from pink Oh a leather style
upper with this really cute almost
Victorian style ruching to the waist in
the waistband and then the pleated skirt
it just falls from the waist it's so
flattering in lovely MIDI style and it
would go with so many nude shoes or
white shoes as well it's just so so
pretty but for my kind of evenings like
I've been saying I'm more of a
restaurant date girl kind of girl that
doesn't like to go to clubs or Drive go
to cocktail bar so that's why most of
these outfits a bit more chilled out and
not so can claw be you know big heels
and kind of glitter and all that sort of
thing it's more kind of chilled out
London gal vibe so with this because
it's quite a very pretty feminine dress
I went for a denim jacket to make it
look a little bit more casual but still
really cool and again I wore my
beautiful Shelby to a rusty Court in the
nude and wax it goes so well with the
colors in the dress little pop of color
I really liked the idea of bringing more
pinks into this because this is quite a
daisy
dusky pink style I'll just bring a bit
more pink out so I also went for a pink
nail polish from as a cheer as a chew I
think that's why I say and this is in
Rose Diamond it's a stunning pink
fuchsia pink lovely and bright I went
for the hensley slice bag and it has
that lovely pop of bright color those
are all seven items which with your
favorite I'd love to know please leave
me a comment down below there were two
things in there from pink oh those
Finders Keepers Queen by Ansan and queen
it was a piece
kote from reese Parvin Elizabeth or
James so many great brands and I just
wanted to show you ways in which if you
did want to spend a little bit more
money on a dress for example that you
want to fit in with everything else in
your wardrobe whether it's for work and
you can take it Morton evening look or
if it's for day and then you want to be
able to wear it again just for the
evening then hope this has been somewhat
helpful remember that the point in this
video is to show you how you can work
things into your wardrobe so I might be
wearing a pair of nude heels for example
you don't have to wear the same nude
heels you can have your own nude heels
where they're from Primark or Topshop or
Louboutin doesn't matter the point is to
show you just how to style it with
things in your wardrobe really hope you
enjoyed this kind of Tryon video
unboxing slash outfit styling it's a bit
of a mingle of a few things this video
but I really enjoyed putting it together
for you so really hope you enjoyed
watching it to give me like if you liked
the video I love to do a lot more these
sorts of videos and subscribe if you're
new and in that case after you my next
song
