size effects and things I bought it
online so I thought that I would do it
for Hall show you what I've collected
recently see if you think so starting
Beauty things I picked up recently these
two nail polishes my absolute phase
moment got the shiny glaze in shock and
pink and the ollie
mayhem mentality and I think I'm really
loving the yarn on the nails at the
moment really gives you kind of like a
bit of a tan I mean I've got the Johnny
Blaze on my hands now it almost makes me
look like I'm a little bit turned which
I quite like I'm just so bright and it
gets so many compliments from one a also
these two are absolute winners I also
recently got the new Estee Lauder
highlighter which is heatwave and it's
the most beautiful golden shimmery
highlighter it's just stunning oh you
can see how bright that is
it's absolutely beautiful and I just put
a little bit on to brush put on to the
tops of my cheekbones and oh my god it's
gorgeous
this is around 31 32 pounds I also got
today early birthday present this which
is absolutely huge and this is what
Estee Lauder called gift wrapping all
came in the gold bow and then when you
open it this was inside kind of a waste
packaging don't you think but it's still
a little bit this is off my flatmate an
early birthday present come going away
in a cup the day but my birthday's when
I'm away so she got me this and this is
so about I think everyone in the UK but
and she has an American boyfriend she
managed to get me one from the US and
it's the SL oddities blog like so many
times in stores and I kept thinking I
need to put opening tip it up and I
can't put myself off by picking up and
then
finally I was like no I want it and as
soon as I wanted it it's all about and
similar to heatwave just got the most
gorgeous shimmery tones and it's just
stunning I can't wait to wear it so that
was an absolute treat today I mean this
was a birthday present so I'm not
entirely sure how much you asked but I
think it will have been around 32 pound
and I think you might have it about 45
US dollars that and why I'm currently
wearing eyelets the moment is my brand
new Illamasqua lipstick in corrupt which
is like a dark plummy pink and kind of
like a deep fuchsia pink it looks like
it's quite a nice deep fuchsia it's
gorgeous
and so highly recommend that completely
matte I have to know if you put up a
Carmex on or a little bit lip balm the
sound of Brenda up and gets a bit more a
shine if you like you prefer that and
otherwise I don't really love the matte
finishes I've also have in modest as
well which is a slightly lighter pink
and I love both equally the lipstick was
$17.99 continuing with illamasqua I also
bought the androgen pigment this
currying a pigment you can add it to a
couple of different areas so it could be
eyeshadow it could be blush copy lip lip
color but it's just most gorgeous a very
light pink coral I use my stippling
brush with this I think it'll be
absolutely beautiful cheeks so that I
love I think this was 23 pound maybe 25
pound further beauty products I also
treat myself to the Moroccan oil
treatment this is the tiny mini version
which is 13 pounds in the light color
I'm not entirely sure all the
differences between the original and the
light I'm guessing I think if I have
some to do with the original having
maybe some soft deep her colors and the
oil but maybe dye nylons hair I'm not
too sure I thought go for like as it
said fine all I call it her so but I go
with this and it's amazing I've put off
buying this for so long because of the
price
got a friend who keeps raving on and on
about it about how much she loves it so
from a holiday I thought I need a time
that a loyal to sit with me my hair can
not stand not having any oil in it
anymore it has to have oil after I've
washed it or else it doesn't feel great
so I thought right I'm gonna shoot
myself and I'm so glad it it really is
fantastic and makes the biggest
difference to hair after washing so I
can't recommend oils more I jumped on
the bandwagon with this one and this is
there is you a luminizing my student
I've seen quite a few youtubers and
bloggers raving about this I thought
come on I'll get it I went to luminizing
most urgent as opposed to the Matt what
you know quite a few bloggers really
love but as I'm I prefer my Joey looks
my makeup I thought I'd go for
luminizing on it's not over luminizing
it doesn't leave you with a little ball
face it's not full of glitter I mean
it's I'd say in terms of the Rimmel wake
me up foundation which does have those
ten little particles in it that make
your face showing it's not even as shiny
as that so I'd say it's somewhat
luminizing and adds a bit for glow but
it isn't going to make you look wet and
really oily so in that respect it's it's
great I went for pearl which is too dark
for me unfortunately I looked on the
website splotches I thought her looks
about right for me and it's not quite
all right should have got over Paul
definitely from a skin tone and deepened
it or preferred one to two of bronzer
I'm glad your review of this you know I
blog actually after loads of swatches
against each other of different
foundations and different shades so that
if you have on those foundations in that
show you to be able to compare and
choose which she way you prefer to buy
but I I'm saying if you've got quite a
fair skin tone like me but you do like
to sort of maybe get a bit more of a
color I'd say go for opal and bronze up
rather than pearl which is quite a bit
deeper really to be honest but otherwise
it's really nice it's quite sure tinted
moisturizer really I've been I listen to
my Laura Mercier silk cream just to give
a bit more of a loop luminosity to the
silk cream and make of it further and
I'm really liking it
something I would really like to
recommend is this which I'm amazed by
its the pro hygiene collection makeup
brush cleaner which I bought from cult
beauty for 995 I think this is for the
ginger for female bottle if you use when
you brush using jana quickly wash it
spritz a bit this onto the brush and
then put your brush into piece of
kitchen well our toilet roll and it can
all all the color completely comes off
your brush on onto the paper and you
brush is cleaned within a few that's
going to there's none to bacterial
sanitizer so it means that you can keep
all of you brushes really clean
throughout say a couple of weeks before
you give them a really good thorough
wash so this is great to see people
she's really clean after each use and
then obviously then give them a good
wash after two weeks or so over a week
if you prefer another thing that's been
on my wish list for ages I kept looking
at it in the store I kept walking away
thinking I'll buy another day finally
picked it up and it seemed Mac vanilla
pigment it really is so nice as if I
always say it's sort of a very creamy
white with gold golden undertones let's
say so when you put it on its kind of
almost get this two-toned creamy golden
effect I've just been using my pencil
brush from Mac did feeling a bit at
listen to it and then applying it to the
inner corners I'll sometimes the
highlight you can also add it to your
cheekbones and I've also been using and
as I keep this bow highlight and it
really is great I mean it's about it's
about 16 pounds in 17 pounds and but
this will last so long and you'll be
able to mix it with so many different
colors and just make your eyes pop be
cheeks pop anytime like so I think it's
something that's quite worth investing
in really moving on to clothing
first of all I bought this cardigan from
ASOS and her 20% off last week and I'm
absolutely in love with it it's the most
gorgeous pink and white knit seeking to
see the white and the pink running
through so it's really cute camouflage
color and it's got the big and I sleeve
and big
pockets and nice big buttons it was a
really nice chunky knit I know obviously
it's summer now and not the kind of time
I'm gonna wear drinking it but this just
took Tovar a little top just to go out
with instead of a jacket I think that
let's be really really cute and I love
the color
it's not a pink at the moment I also
bought these trainers from Zara because
I'm good after him going away soon and I
was doing quite a bit of walking so I
wanted to buy some trainers that were
both awesome and comfortable so family
is on Zahra and the colors just amazing
just awesome there with their bright
neon orange and red laces and their
different colors going through and sort
of really local as well so I'm hoping to
perhaps that isn't going to rub my feet
as much because I've got really fussy
fees that they were $49.99 for fifty
quid so bought more shoes these are from
new look and they just cross over your
feet
like this and then they pop at the back
of this and they're just the most
comfortable sandals again like I said
really foxy feet so I just wanted
something for my holiday that would be
really confident fit perfectly and
didn't Rob anywhere because if it's not
the back it's a from or it's a side bit
so with this is no leather involved it's
entirely fabric and they're just pieces
seem really nicely well and not well
made and I mean these are a wide fit not
exactly got wide feet but they don't do
them in a normal shoe and they just fit
so nice so it got those they were 17
pound and they also didn't a cream and a
coral I've got a few bits of jewelry as
well sorry they were from the new look
say and I also bought this from new
Lockwood she might have seen a few
different blogs but I couldn't not get
it I'm just absolutely loving and spikes
and things at the moment and this has
got these gorgeous black jewels in
between attaching to the necklace and
then they attach to the spikes it's on
quite a nice sort of short chain so it
should have saw
fit around the neckline really nicely so
look to that that was five-pound on
tonight and also from new look
continuing with the spike fee I also
bought this necklace which was $7.99 but
no it's very very similar but this is
made up entirely of spikes all it goes
down to sort of triangular shape into
the very long one at the bottom again
it's quite a statement necklace but I'm
just loving spikes in the moment it so
but why not really really look back at
this from hearts and bows and which is a
really cute little lace vest and let me
worried that maybe it'd be quite
see-through but actually it's not
I don't know how wait promise it
slightly slightly see-through slightly
sheer and but generally compared to live
tops I've tried on you can get away with
wearing I've got brown this if you
wanted to but it's so cute little crop
perfect with a little short look with a
cute underneath this cardigan actually
as well I like it
and this this is $12.99 I think I've
also had my eye on the ragged hat in
neon pink for about two months now
again a bit drawn to this color so and
plus because I've had pink hair recently
I quite like pink with pink most people
probably won't put pink with pink but I
do so and this was 15 pound I got it on
a starts at the 20% off because I but
it's just so cute I'm trying I don't
know I've got two little home things to
show you first of all is the neon
look she organics candle in enchantment
which is the Bluebell and Rose scent and
it's just so nice it's got that really
kind of fresh flower smell like what
woodland flowers like as if you walk you
through the woods and all the new
flowers coming out it's that kind of
smell and it's just beautiful I've had
this sat on my side of my bed for a week
now and you can just smell it around the
room and it's gorgeous and that's not
even
don't have to sat there with the with
the lid off so burning I'm a bit scared
to there that's not really want to put
her neck because it's just so pretty and
but I know burning it is is going to be
amazing the wax melts really perfectly
down the candle so you don't get any
residue on the outside you get to use
the attach to the candle and this is 42
pounds officer you want to be able to
use the entire to the candle but you can
down as hell the quality for that price
so this is kind of perfect thing for me
we present something like that but
beautiful to show you this because it's
just really really cute I've been loving
it and it's the base booms and get much
two-lane push it together it's like this
to carry around so it's absolutely tiny
and then it comes with wire so you can
plug it in and then you just plug that
into your iPod iPhone etc and and then
it plays the sound quality is really
really good quite desi it goes really
loud this actually goes louder than my
macbook pro the only batteries for it
you charge it via the little connection
which goes into computer or
alternatively if you've got a plug with
the USB in it you can then charge it off
that you wall so I think am i I want to
go into it I think I might have to tear
this traveling with me oh I think I'm
actually taste traveling with me it's
just so it's so cute so handy and be
great for around camp and listen to
music and things so this is 50 pound I
think the usual 80 pound of pasta 70
pound thrown off at the moment 50 pound
but if you're looking for this all this
little tiny speaker that you can carry
around with you all times and use
actually really good quality then I
highly recommend this and it comes in so
many different colors as well so highly
recommend it and that's everything and I
hope you enjoyed that and maybe I
inspired you for some new clothes or
some new beauty products you're thinking
to maybe get it's time you'll see me now
I think for our three months if you
might not realize but I'm off to America
