drugstore makeup tutorial so many of you
have asked me for this video I've just
been trying to find a few new products
to bring together and this is in a way a
bit of a first impressions video too
because so many of these products I've
got laid out in front of me here I
haven't used before got quite a few from
Barry and some new things Rimmel some
new things from collection so I'm just
going to show them to you while I try
them on myself just to see what we both
thought of them this is a look that I
did it's a very jewy spring very subtle
quite natural springy look I'm also a
new location because I just fancied
getting out of my small room plus the
light is playing funny with me so I
really hope you can actually see me
throughout this video let me know what
you think of this location for doing
makeups it's more of a face on shot
rather than sideways like I used to it
so let me know what you think and if
you'd like to get this look then please
keep watching excuse my crazy looking
hair thrown it up ok I'm going to start
off with the best moisturizer used it so
long it's the lush million-dollar
moisturizer I've already got a little
bit arm that's good some more this just
adds so much glow into the skin it's
absolutely incredible I recommend this
to so many people ok I thought today
thing is going to be summer soon we're
going to go with more summery products
so I'm going to go with the vitamin E
tinted moisturizer from the body shop
this used to be my foundation of choice
like I used to use its foundation for so
many years today I'm going to do this
all with a real techniques sponge and
I've already pre wet this properly ok
usually spray it but I found recently
actually properly wetting it through it
doubles in size and it's easy to work
with so I'm going with it take that from
the hand
I'll over the skin okay so I'm going to
go with concealers now but I knew wants
to try I've got youth berryann flawless
light reflection concealers i'm going to
give these ago i have ivory and a half
age and I was watching them earlier and
you did look quite thin but i thought i
could add this to the very in a corner
at the ivory and then we're at beige
just under this section TI little bit
deeper
okay so irritatingly my battery died and
they've had to take like an hour out
just to charge the batteries so my face
looks different and very sorry I'm going
to go on to note powdering and minis
Maybelline mapmaker mattifying powder
quite nice I'm going to put on my chin
down my nose pretty much everywhere that
would just added that concealer okay I'm
gonna add a bit of color back into the
face when you see solar powder from soap
&amp;amp; Glory first off and we're going to
take a big Real Techniques powder brush
mix up in salt on my neck blend all of
this down and then I'm gonna start on my
temples it's almost of it we're doing a
bit of a bronzing contour routine here
so across the forehead and I like to
take the brush sideways and just cheers
all right up drawer and then I'm just
going to take the collection gorgeous
blow looks a bit like the Bobby brash
and the bricks this and one take the
Real Techniques blush brush we settle
over and just work that over this
contour area it's a little bit more
bronze and I'm going to take the other
gorgeous color palette this one's in
blush block so that was the bronzing
block this is a blush block it's going
to use the buffing brush will think I'm
going to use it very lightly across
these top sections here really light
pinky mainly the cream I'm just going to
add that top of my cheeks
a little bit of a highlight so a good
thing about these you can use in fridge
real purpose so you can use highlight we
can with all over it for a blush Matt to
have so many new blushes here that I
really try I've got this one from Barry
M make me blush also got this one as
well make me blush cream which I tribe
on it look really lovely so I'm gonna
try this my try this i'm going to add it
onto the pulse and then use mostly to
bun that out it's a really pretty shade
it's going to need is my sponge just to
go back to that and just go to the top
blend it down a little bit your brows I
have this from Barry M the brow pencil
and brush when i get this a girl just
going to use a spoolie end to rush
through the brows and then look color to
a half I've light to medium quite thick
pencil though so it's not the most
precise brush in the world but the color
is actually quite nice
yeah really press for that to set it i'm
gonna use the body shop brower lash gel
just to keep that set in place all day
just because I will have the last shim
at I'm gonna go in with that gorgeous
glow and a zoeva look sheer cheek and
just add a little bit more glitz over
the top next up I dived into my
eyeshadow collection and found this one
from wild earth not just how brilliant
it was this is an assignment treatment
so it has a lavender move a black and a
beige e co opener champagne pink the
very top so we're going to go in with
Real Techniques brush it's in the next
pics collection I absolutely love this
brush going to use that very lightest
pinky champagne shade in the inner
corner
and then I'm just going to take the mozy
shade and put that over the lid and into
the upper corner this is such a
beautiful shade and it's so shimmery and
pigmented it's going to take a larger
fluffier brush this is a sigma e40 i'm
going to go back in with that brow bone
color the light color and just use that
on the brow bone and to just blend out
perfil shutter to finish off the lids I
really want to use this it's the fifth I
me me me it's a rich color I defining
cream do pot in woodland truffle it's a
really pretty silver shade I'm going to
dab that over the very center just for a
little extra sparkle wine up I'm going
to finish off the eye for the Revlon
Photoready casual eye pencil in map
charcoal it's like a gray black marble
gray charcoal I'm just going to line the
top
it really is quite grave I really quite
like it I'm just going to use my Zoe
brow line brush just to take some this
product and help create Marvel wing with
it all sort of help to blend that down
over the left ok quietly that's quite
nice like the one thing that's bugging
me I must be honest if I don't feel like
I have enough concealer on so you don't
want to say i'm going to use what the
mark a sealer I'm gonna use my trustees
collection 2000 this is in the lighter
shade i think i'm just going to add a
little bit that on there if you like
this area needs a little bit frightening
i'm just going to mix out a little bit
of the round wake me up in a three
I think I just really prefer my
concealer having more of a thicker
consistency that really seems to hold on
there to the skin better much better a
little bit power into that and just okay
mascara I'll be completely honest with
you I'm not the biggest fan of drugstore
mascaras I feel like one of the things
that you can splurge on if you're
looking if you can if your budget is
more for drugstore products perfect but
I would always recommend splurging on a
mascara just because I find personally
that drugstore mascaras for my straight
eyelashes do not hold curl so I'm really
sorry to have to put a premium product
in this drugstore tutorial but I really
wanted to show you this examined
absolutely love with it myself at the
moment it's a welcome doll eyes in
waterproof Hypnose doll eyes waterproof
it's got a lovely triangular wand the
main thing about this is that it holds
the curl so the only two mascaras I have
ever used at work to hold the curl is
this one one can hit nerves doll eyes or
the Clarins waterproof it's called the
Trulie waterproof and they're both
amazing okay so doll eyes applied as you
can see my eyes are nice and open and
the curl is staying put can you believe
it so all we have to do now is lipstick
barrier map me up lip crayon in a smooth
and creamy texture this is in number to
fill it with your pink
I'm actually quite impressed with the
textured there and a color as well this
reminds me of Sonny so you'll from Mac
you've ever tried that and I'm just
going to finish off a little bit of
gloss and this is the lip bus burial it
boss high-powered boss in number four
this is not something you can wear alone
though I tried earlier alone it looked
awful this so this tastes and smells
like purty falou Betty fellow yogurt how
good was pretty fellow yogurt I mean now
and again I still buy it I never forget
but what a state is that yogurt that is
it let's take out this horrible bun and
that is a finished look guys we do you
enjoy that so many of you have asked me
