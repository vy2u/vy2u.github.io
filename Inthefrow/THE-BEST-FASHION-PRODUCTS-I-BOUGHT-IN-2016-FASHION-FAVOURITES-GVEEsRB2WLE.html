oh you're all doing so well today's
video is going to be going through all
of the kind of fashion pieces I
absolutely loved last year I've already
done makeup and skincare and hair so
I'll leave that video link somewhere on
the screen and down below as keeps want
to see that but I didn't really have
time that video to go through fashion
and everything that picked up last year
I absolutely adored wearing so much so I
wanted to go through everything that I
really loved seeing this were quite a
few pieces here I'm just gonna kind of
Whittle through super quick and of
course everything will be listed down
though it's always first thing a pair of
sunglasses I love the most and I had to
go for these the Dior
surreal glasses so many people have them
last year I realize but they just look
incredible their problem statement pair
of sunglasses there are always so many
different outfits especially in this
colorway just being more silvery they
were just a really cool pair of glasses
that I loved wearing probably my most
favorite brand of shoes and also heels
last year of course I've got to say it
was a junkie toe rusty Calabria quartz I
have these a few different styles now
and I have some more Shelby toe scales
as well I found them to be the most
comfortable I feel really stylish when I
wear these shoes to go with absolute
everything I mean he's my newest version
I thought show you a little bit beaten
and bruised now but these are a new pair
that I have in the blush pink and
honestly they're so comfortable and yeah
it's fun to be like the most versatile
pair of shoes that I have in terms of
bags I have to give a shout out to my
Chanel
well I'm Shane back I got this last
February when I went to Fashion Week
with L'Oreal re nips and Chanel and I
completely fell in love with its bag I
haven't seen it in the start before this
isn't the herringbone Navy fabric and
it's just one of those bags that I've
worn so much I generally take it with me
on every trip because I know that I'll
be able to wear it for most occasions
and it's just so pretty I mean how
pretty the chain strap and to me it's a
sophisticated bag you can wear with
everything
plus it was my first ever Chanel
purchase so it's pretty special and it
was an amazing experience and yeah I
love it
for another pair of shoes I have to
mention that these boots that I got from
Dora I got these about two months ago
and honestly
had to be like my favorite pairs of
shoes for the entire year
I just adore how they look on me they're
exactly the kind of big tired or black
ankle boots with a lovely kind of chunky
wearable heel but still with a bit of
height on it so you feel kind of like
you swung around the city in your
favorite pair kind of heeled boots
pointed toe wonderful material honestly
the go with everything and I absolutely
love wearing these so so much one of my
favorite swimwear pieces of last year I
walk quite a bit because I went on
holiday so much it was absolutely
incredible it's this swimsuit from
Keaney and she's in the Navy with all
the beautiful colors along the straps
and seams and it's just a really cool
brand I really love everything its brand
deals the bikinis always look incredible
whenever I see them on people on
Instagram but for me this was just so
flattering it was also quite sexy with
the low back and I just felt really
lovely wearing it so definitely a
favorite this was one of my favorite
sweaters over the past three months or
so this is from All Saints but I got so
many amazing things from All Saints last
season the season before I honestly feel
that they are totally back on my game I
went in there the other day I love
pretty much it wasn't it so concurrently
and the past few seasons I'd loved so
much that I've been selling so all
things is definitely broaden when I'm
keeping an eye out for this year but
yeah this is definitely my favorite
piece I'm pretty sure they still have
this in as well so cozy
Stuart Wiseman I finally got myself a
pair Stuart Weitzman boots in around
September I think and I don't know what
put me off for so long but as soon as I
got film I completely got the height
these are actually a brand new pair I
have the dark grey blue shades and these
are the lightest shade they do which is
more of a beige tone and I bought these
recently so I could wear and more dark
outfits with it and break up the colors
a little bit more I'm so glad I did I
mean they're just an amazing shoe
honestly I can't recommend these anymore
the wonderful fabric wonderful materials
are so well made and they're so
comfortable as well and they just go
with so much I could not do this video
without mentioning them another favorite
bag of the year has to be my dear dear
Armour again mainly because this is the
first deal bag I've ever bought and I
have my own it for so long
also it's so wearable it's a beautiful
fabric it's so beautifully made and this
cool that just makes me swoon
every time that I say honestly he was
such an amazing investment after 2016
another brand I need to convert the
sheriff's out - I'm not gonna kind of
hold up everything that I got from their
last year apart from this it's time this
needs and I am like you would not
believe it's been in my wardrobe and
desperate for a tie but I don't if you
remember me wearing this dress so March
especially the early side of 2016 I was
- Fashion Week in Paris and it's a
Joseph dress it's a most beautiful silk
fabric it goes down into like a MIDI
length and I absolutely adored wearing
this I felt so beautiful wearing this in
this gorgeous fabric little belt that
went around the waist and honestly I
just love this so so much it's one of
the first times I've invested really in
Joseph's pieces and I was so glad it
absolutely loved everything that they do
is such a beautiful brand another brand
I invested in that last year and I have
never done so before was famine and of
course I went for their kind of
statement and famous blaze of style
don't know why it just needs a bit of a
lint roll I think at the moment I think
it's been sat next to a knitted jumper
which doesn't help but I wore this quite
a lot especially in kind of Silla months
a year and it's just an absolute
incredible piece it's so wearable it
goes with so much and straightaway you
can tell us is about man jackets just
says it all over it just makes it a
really beautiful piece to wear when you
want to be more casual or even if you're
going out it is kind of that
transitional piece it just spices up any
outfit I love it another couple of
rounds I have to mention first up you
have this come in self-portrait
self-portrait as you know is brand I
invest a lot into and it's a brand that
I wear majority of times when I go out
for events absolutely love everything
they do and this is one of the pieces I
got last year which I totally felt in
the foot but then on the back this is
another way if you haven't watched my
fashion storage hacks video I'll leave
it linked on the screen but it's just
about ways that I keep things in my
wardrobe and this is one of the ways
kind of back and forth hanging for extra
space this is an incredible Roxanna
dress I got last year and again I wore
it for Fashion Week
in September and in fact this is on sale
at the moment
thing I absolutely love this and again
it was just a piece I felt super pretty
and it was very kind of dainty and
doll-like but still with almost a bit
the westernized feel to some of the
trims and it was just so beautiful I
loved wearing this so so much and
similarly another burn to the top that
massively needs an iron but Peter Pilato
I love everything that this brand is
about it's about color and shape and
abstract and pattern and beautiful
materials and every time that I watch
their shows I'm total earning a it's
usually always my favorite show of the
season absolutely everything they do and
this was a top that I got last year
Nicholas saw me wearing this so much
because I wore it so much I loved it
but you just went with so many things
and this made me feel super pretty very
feminine it was just an investment into
a brand that I really really adore I
think a lot of that was definitely faith
again this piece needs a really good
lint roll but I get it to a brand that I
spent a lot of my time looking at and
seeing what they've got in their newest
season first of all it was this black
jacket from Marsh I'm pretty sure or
Amelia has his jacket as well it's
honestly one of the most wearable pieces
of the entire year I think I wore it
throughout every single month last year
I think everyone needs an amazing black
jacket like this in their wardrobe it's
a perfect links not too long not too
short it's a good enough thickness so
it's not too heavy and it's also not too
light so you can wear it in a corner
months with a scarf or a jumper it's
just an extremely flattering shape just
a couple of buttons to keep you all held
in some pockets and some beautiful
lapels and I think that's kind of all
you need in a really good jacket it
looks very flattering but has all the
qualities you need in a good coat that
can go through all of the seasons and
this is definitely it but for me March
always has an incredible jacket every
season I want a jacket and go to March I
know I can find something that totally
fits what I'm after I honestly love this
brand to pieces another thing that I got
last year which pull my favorite things
of the whole year he's actually my Dior
watch quite often I get asked about this
watch because I wear it every single day
so it's in every picture in every video
but it was a massive investment that I
made I wanted me for watch it's pretty
much one the only jewelry pieces I ever
really wear is a watch as email deal
my favorite absolutely favorite brand
there is and I wanted to invest in a
watch that I could wear for the rest of
my life this was it and honestly I can't
tell you how much I'd always watch
there's been upside no problem with it I
took it back recently to the store just
to get it clean and they had it cleaned
for me beautifully it just makes me
happy every time I look at it so if
you're looking to invest in like a look
shoe style watch because you love your
watches then answer I would so highly
recommend you or they have such a
beautiful display of different types of
watches and this is what I went for this
is the Dumont 1/8 I think in the
automatic style and it's in silver with
a mother-of-pearl face and diamonds just
around the inside and the final final
piece of the year that wants to mention
with actually this Gucci backpack I feel
like I mentioned this recently actually
but I pull this out again recently I
started wearing it again
I just remembered how much I loved it
how versatile it is and how easy it is
to wear it's a really great fabric so
it's not going to scratch which is
obviously something you really need in a
backpack because you wear it so often it
fits so much in for such a lovely cute
little backpack as long as almost
between a minute and a larger backpack
it's not too tiny
but with these chains on the back it's
adorable it's very unique it stands out
and I mean I got this in duty-free so
it's a little bit cheaper and that
really kind of helps a little bit with
making this a little bit more affordable
if you're asked to like a luxury
backpack so yeah shout out I love it and
also I mean Gucci in general last year
we signed on my favorite luxury brands
they absolutely nailed it last year I
can't fault it and they did
apart from maybe the furry flip of
things I wasn't overly keen on but yeah
look this so much
I'm gonna leave it there for everything
that I really really loved last year
there were so many brands that I really
coveted
and I would highly recommend and again
