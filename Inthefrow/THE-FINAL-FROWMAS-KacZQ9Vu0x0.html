there was no frame of day 21 because
yesterday I spent all day working again
day 20 and day 21 with full working days
and blog post writing days which feels
good because I managed to get quite a
few things done that I really want to
get done it was on my mind
but today cific more fonts are thought
bringing along with me for this I've got
a meeting with my manager I've got to go
get my nails done again I'm really
excited
yeah you've seen the girls in Burberry
at for brunch oh and then I get to go
and pick up my Prada boots from
Selfridges because I have to take them
back in because they got slightly
damaged on the heel I could let you have
them about three or four days and they
got damaged so they've been away in
Italy for the past three four weeks game
fix so I'm gonna go get those
that looks good a banana
come back a tribe I think I'm gonna go
for this one today

new to white hombre and she saw she's
shake them into the ballerina style

this is just my favorite cafe they're
literally doing the nicest ice photos
here okay so my ladies are here I'll
leave a link below you'll love tomorrow
and we've all disordered Phillies got
really good toasted ham and cheese on
the sourdough and Sue's ordered extra
chips which player good idea and

recommendation yeah join your club when

went to Selfridges because I wanted to
pick up my Prada boots I bought the
Prada boots I won a few times and then I
don't know what happened but I ended up
sort of tearing at the leather on the
heel so anyway so I took them into the
store these would look like just very
very me and repair them for me for free
which is amazing so for those people who
are always like why'd you spend so much
money on shoes etc it's because you get
the customer service and you get to take
back your shoes and get them repaired
properly if they get damaged whereas if
you bought the shoes from Topshop
they'll just be like you kidding me but

pointed and I nails has finally kind of
grown enough so got some shape to them
