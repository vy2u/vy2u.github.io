very very fast this is the gathering
point so here is the restaurant spa I've
never seen everything I know it's

love about them all day the thing is the
cuisine the Maldivian fish Cory is one
of the best things ever I need to make
it at home in Spanish a respite
morning guys it's our first full day
here in the Maldives
unfortunately it's now stormy and we had
like a big boat trip planned today
doesn't like that it's gonna happen I'm
not feeling great either I just had an
awful night sleep I barely slept a wink
all night so now I just feel exhausted
and quite sickly we're gonna get out and
about for a little bit and to see what's
going on with the plans okay guys so we
miss the boat rent because I felt so
sick I felt so nausea I lit well pretty
right now with this sometime I felt
really really nauseous and I thought
mixing that with my travel sickness a
boat it's not going to go very very well
we're making the most of this windy
weather it's still absolutely gorgeous
so we're gonna go get some lunch and
babes
finally starting the day you know it no
ha oh my goodness it's beautiful in here
I am in my element right now with this
salad bar I've got all these cool like
jars of everything you could ever want
every type of olive oil every type of
leaf extra celery honestly mind if I
just take this whole block we've got a
really yummy yummy lunch we have this
delicious tomato pasta overlooking the
ocean
I mean honestly the aesthetics in this
room are absolutely beautiful this is
where you come in

for a little bit
it's pretty we just stumbled upon this
little beach this gorgeous so it Dilek
with all the white swipe runs that's
blown in and got bleached but then the
guys once we get back from the boat
pretty soon I'm guessing that it's
probably raining now for them folks I've
had a good time back to the room I love
it when you go out and then you come
back like half an hour later it seems
and it's all amazingly tired so nice
okay now Alex fancy fingers it's now
slightly raining Alex thinks it's a good
idea to go on this slide it's gonna be
good
a crowd as far as well kind bar we can
share of it no there's no way to go my
kind / thank you
ah you run a deficit gonna eat this
while he's not here put your arms but
when you do it I'll go forward you need
to take like a run jump this is the
biggest anticlimax of my life the time
has got the benefit flow okay so we are
going out for dinner now after the whole
day together we want to sauce see other
people and speak to whether it be sick
of each other so we're gonna have dinner
and I was gonna go so casual and then I
stole that I brought this whole bomb
outfit with me and I was like okay I
like this so this is what I'm wearing
this little orange top is actually just
from another Island we've got a really
nice detail to the back and this is kind
of cool I like the orange with the gold
buttons and then I just paired with her
ball go back for extra gold so it's
actually like a pre booty else no I
don't even mean for it to be hustling no
