in complete honesty it's 2 o'clock now I
did try to start the vlog when I woke up
which was 8 a.m. but at that time I
looked like I had had my face hit with a
hammer so I wasn't keen on putting up
that footage of course would be lots of
footage of me without makeup on in this
way just was a pretty bad morning so
anyways it's 2 o'clock I spent all
morning getting Sunday's video edited
it's quite a long one and also quite a
kind of loads of shots in that once that
took me a while and I'm just about to
film my men's Christmas gift guide video
which you'll see tomorrow know which
we'll see
or don't know and then I'm gonna get my
nails done because although these wants
are still on these ones I'm not
I love how many people really liked
these nails like Lydia I think it's
Lydia was Lucy no Olivia
Lydia went and got these when it was the
same things don't really like themselves
it was really nice I just wish that they
did acrylics it dry but I got a lot to
get some big acrylics and get more
length on them because I do have shellac
a lot they have broken down a lot and I
had to cut another day because they were
all chipping and it just looked awful so
anyway so I'm gonna go to dry by I'll
take along with me to that I'm also
gonna take out my new handbag today I'm
so excited I treat myself to the use of
our Shi Antigona in deep blue on in the
Black Friday sales from Selfridges um
and it came yesterday and it's perfect I
thought the blue wasn't gonna be right I
wanted like a navy blue and I was
worried that it wasn't gonna be the
right color but it was I'm so pleased so
I'm going to take that out with me as
well and otherwise I'm just gonna go now
and set up my camera and all my
equipment and film this men's Christmas
gift and hopefully get it edited before
I leave for
dryline postman just came and look what
arrived
my hourglass ambient lighting edit
palette it's so pretty look how pretty
it is
I'm a desperate force palette for so
long finally got my hands on it I win so
I'm going to start filming I'm gonna
film the front of our tree so it's rude
if I don't really want to show you too
much because you'll see all of that in
Sunday's video that I put together hence
why it was a happy one
so yeah let's get set up I am on my way
out such a strange feeling remember to
paddle the camera don't usually have to
do this I'm gonna have to go all in to
turn now to Oxford Street Oxford sir
this way to get my nails do it we don't
get starve except definitely get
Starbucks on the way take a peek at the
new Shivaji
through it I'm talking at Lotte
I can't decide what I'm gonna get I'm
gonna go before going for this one hand
it's really hard to do things I'm having
my Sherlock taken up with coils like
they put foil some of now Porsche me of
acetone in yes so I'm gonna go this
really gorgeous red ugly true on here
and countess it's called Revere it and
apparently it's not limited to Christmas
and they really do it at Christmas this
one here the second one that's on my
toes and then I'm a finger nails I'm
going for a mixture sort of light with
the things so I want a kind of pink
white ombre I love it in handle this so
this is dry by this is what I always go
on about it or get my nails done look at
these gorgeous little foods where we do
everything and I know
pedicured but I'm getting boats I'm get
my feet sure I didn't get my hands
shellacked
look how beautiful my nails are Amelia's
doing the most incredible job on this
hombre it's insane look how makes its
manicure is I'm so in love with it
oh now I just really managed to vlog on
the way back but I quickly lipped into
Waitrose and got some it's a teeny so
just gonna have some soups favorite ever
broccoli soup and Meridian peanut butter
that has its hundred-percent peanut soap
and exercise and then I picked up my
favorite sweets such as it eats and mass
can kittens these are so delicious
got myself a bottle of port because it's
Christmas
got our little lamb record player played
some t-swift
I'm so in love with my nails how amazing
are these so I went I asked for a pink
to white ombre which she did and then I
asked for like a glitter top coat what
she did so it looks absolutely gorgeous
and on my toesies I went for the festive
glittery red color so they're super
buttery and gold yes so I have quite a
lot of editing to do I need to edit
tomorrow's video I need to edit a blog

Tuesday night at 7:15 so I'm gonna leave
