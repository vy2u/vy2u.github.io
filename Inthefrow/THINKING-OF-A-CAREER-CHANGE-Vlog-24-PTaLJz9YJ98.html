time Saturday I went home so my whole
family free from the gathering some day

friends came back here and yesterday I
was working on a project and after my
last vlog where as a little bit down and
voice my opinion fat about how in a bit

conference call again and then the
British Heart Foundation came to pick up
some fast stuff so we donated a big
chest of drawers jumped we donated four
of our dining chairs which I literally
bought last year and moved in and we
