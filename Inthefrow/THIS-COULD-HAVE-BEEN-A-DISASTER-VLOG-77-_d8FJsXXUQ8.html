to the Maldives we're all pretty much
packed I feel like I've forgotten a lot
of things cuz my suitcase is half empty
which is weird but it's because I've
literally just Pat bikinis like two
pairs of sheets
so literally my suitcase is just totally
empty right no no I was putting this
video together for you guys of last
week's footage and realized three whole
days and missing so frantically last
night for about a few hours we were
locking on every computer every memory
card everywhere turns out that the card
has been wiped
unfortunately so I've missed a few days
luckily I didn't vlog on Monday Excel
super busy so that's Lloyd anyway
cheese J I'm just went for a lovely
meeting with Chanel Beauty talked
through that gorgeous new collection I
had a cat shop which was lovely and
again came back and worked all night so
that again was all that eventful
although it did have a bit of a chat
with you guys about something and I now
can't do that so I'll do that I can in a
few days because there's something I
wanted to kind of talk to you guys about
and yes that's gone anyway on the
Wednesday the only things that you've
really missed is that I went and got my
lashes done I went to my usual lady
Debbie at Nouveau lashes and she usually
does me LVL treatments where I get a
lash lift but this time because we got
the Maldives I thought why not just try
some lash extensions I've not had them
in about four years I wasn't overly keen
on the last lash extensions ago so the
different branches go and it just didn't
really work for me but because now I get
LVL it means that my lashes are a bit
killed anyway so when you put the
extensions on I felt they would hold
better and Debbie great so I've gone for
the SPS lashes you'll probably see some
clips of me from last week in a second
but um the SPS lashes they stand for
speed volume and and style speed volumes
down rather than the Russian lashes
they're a lot thicker bit more
structured SVS lashes are a lot more
kind of feathery and fluttery and there
isn't as much precision to it it's more
about placing them in a more volumizing
way rather than the Russians which
account of like perfected
if effort for me because I only have
small eyes I don't want anything that's
too like harsh anyway so that's what I
got so in the next few Clips I start the
day off by being like I've got my lashes
on yeah so that's what I was doing on
the Wednesday when I got my lashes done
and loads of meetings that day as well
Bob so they've they've all gone now but
not to worry we'll move on so next thing
you'll see is me from left Thursday
morning guys welcome to Thursday I have
just got myself ready half past nine I'm
going out going out for for a meeting
with clinic then I'm meeting with a PR
agents that look after lots of different
brands that I love which would be fun
and now I'm going to gleam so got a few
things on the agenda today I got myself
ready it's nice havin another full face
of makeup and some nice fluttery lashes
because this made me a coffee so much
I'm a quick coffee before I head out
okay ready this is what I'm going for
seeing as I know that this is so big I
need to get my wear out of it like now
so I've gone for this with the gray
sweater again I realize it's combo it's
quite cute let's let the trousers do
boots little doggy bag pretty much just
everything that I had lying around I'm
just throwing on and my fave for the day
yeah I'm gonna get over now to Soho for
my first meeting four miles apart now
it's erm three o'clock four hours I've
just been in to go you've seen my
amazing manager and emptying my peer box
got an incredible treat I'm shocked to
show you a few of them later one thing I
did get that oh that was from Christmas
just arrived
Chanel gorgeous bangle cuff
beautiful swag gorgeous trees and I
think there's enough equipment or
something here for ages
new old shoes and everything so I've
been here a few hours so now I need to
head home see what Alex is uptight it's
not running right in the flat and with
you back okay it is the evening now I
have just got myself ready to not go
into an event for Carolina Herrera and
the good girl
perfume such a gorgeous smell i'm so
rubbish describing sentence so rubbish
but it's a really very feminine gorgeous
smell but just with like a certain edge
so i am wearing a full Carolina Herrera
suit tonight these sleeves are amazing
absolutely gorgeous I was paired it with
a little black cami doesn't anything
else happy would have been showing and I
have the matching of the matching
trousers on as well shoes are Manolo
Blahniks oh nice
are these cab will be here any minute
I'm so good just do some a slight little
finishing touches and then we may even
go out for like a little date night
after this I don't know when the event
finishes but we'll see if I'm looking
forward to this Karlie Kloss is hosting
the event tonight so it should be really
really gorgeous okay right to the event
so it's good girl Carolina Herrera event
very very pretty dilation here needs
were looking a beautiful mister so
difficult events gonna go up now to the
lounge area countdown well it seems you
will be here for the launch of good girl
which has been a lot of wonderful work
it's being never years and years in the
making this is a fragrance for a
powerful feminine intelligent fun an
unexpected woman she gives it all what
she gets she gets back and I think
that's extremely important doing
everything she does and I think that's
what a good girl is I mean absolutely
honored to be part of this fragrance
because this fragrance represents a
spirit that I think is embodied by first
and foremost the incredible mrs. Herrera
herself it doesn't have to be just one
thing you can be feminine you can be
strong you will be confident empowered
and sensual and soft and there's I think
that duality that kind of juxtaposition
of both sides actually makes us much
more interesting she is absolutely Mae
back home that was such a lovely event
just won the super nice really
well-planned very beautiful events nice
to see everyone and again we've just
ordered Wagga members we're literally
like obsessed with weather elements

to do some work tomorrow look any some
other bits as well good night guys see

then that's when I thought I was
watching you and I thought is she woken
up and then you just put your like
styling he's pretty head back down
falsely dude oh really that's so weird
why am i doing because of the way my
skin was I have literally gone fully
Alenia and date from cleanser to that
bright and clear solution which isn't a
toner
what kind of similar buys for tone you
put on after your cleansing I have two
serums
I've also got a retinol that I have been
drying I've tried it twice so far I'm
really spacing out the days between when
I try it and when I do
just a dream that my skin get used to it
and I have their moisturiser which I'm
absolutely in love with it's this
recovery balm why they go on I think
this is just a mini one absolute
gorgeous products so I'm literally only
using them morning noon and night
so using the lemare renewal oil on my
spots just to try and help them along to
heal but everything else this is all I'm
doing so I don't know give you a review
yet I want to properly use these for a
couple of weeks only these literally
even just down to cleansing I'm not
using any other cleansers just to see if
this really helps me out a bit put in
tiny bit concealer on gives me nice now
I'm gonna go to pharmacy and have a
little bit of breakfast and then we're
going to the gym on a little bit of lip
map net sorry oh wait I got your pink
and I'm gonna use my Tom Ford what's
this called fiber brow gel just makes
such a big difference and it keeps you
in place as well

like there
vibrant beans ever know there's some
vibrant being English breakfast at

I'm just going to get onto the computer
to start editing up next from this video
I'm gonna carry a little bit of work get
myself a bath and a bed when I exfoliate
big-time and I spent a few hours I've
just been designing some bits and bobs
on the computer and I also took some
pictures for a skincare post but there
are a lot of different things I want to
talk about from oils and moisturizers
especially products that I know don't
break me out and that says love in this
game today so I'll have a little peek at
that if you like there's ten different
products in there that I think erupted
so the amazing from different brands
come to kind of mix it up it's gonna go
lie on the bed with my laptop and I
really want to start watching big little
lies I've heard a lot of cool things
about it I really wanna get that go I
big Alexander Skarsgard found although
I'm pretty sure in this he plays a bit
of a nasty character but I think I'm
gonna do I'm just going to stop working
cuz I've been working afternoon after
the gym and I'm like what am i doing and
I found myself then just procrastinate
and just doing stuff for the sake of it
like
checking Instagram again checking
Twitter and I might just still not five
minutes ago like why don't I just
actually spend time doing something away
from my mobile away from work so I'm
turning it off for the night I'm not
doing any more work tonight I'm gonna
put my phone down from driving to the
night and just thought how a bit of a
chill time I'm gonna have a bath as well
