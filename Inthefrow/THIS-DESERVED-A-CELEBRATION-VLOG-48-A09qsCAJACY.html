need to take some initially some footage
for project I've got coming up so we've
got a few things on the agenda when I go
to Whole Foods and buy and lows and
knife bits for dinner and for snacks
we're gonna go to boots pick up some
last-minute things it's one of those
kind of like Saturdays where you do
everything what okay you doing okay
roundabout it's really nice actually now
it keeps kind of coming over a bit gray
but rain bit blue sky I just get some
little shots shots for the video and
just taken some pictures and now I'm
gonna go down to whole food but just an
issue back home feeling
oh yeah
back in the house now we went to the pub
nearby just like some beers the folly of
the day and now we're back and we're
making dinner because I didn't really
have any lunch so we're having like an
early dinner I'm attempting to make toad
in the hole with my vegetarian sausages
but I realized that I didn't have any
plain flour
so I've used coconut flour obviously I
didn't use no milk so we used soya milk
so I hopefully no idea how you so people
it's going to turn out probably not
great we're doing yeah we're doing turn
the home broccoli and then sweet potato
mash with gravy on the side it's like a
bangers and mash kind of vibe should be
pretty tasty if the Yorkshire puddings
do okay otherwise there may literally
just spit like a flat pancake with
sausages in them funk for TAFE good
well my option pudding is actually look
pretty good we've got a lot of math a
lot of broccoli and gravy this actually
looks a lot better than I anticipated it
would I'm very very excited morning guys
and welcome to Sunday morning it's
nearly midday well it's been a much
midday and we've just been doing a
little bit where this morning I've been
taking some new blog post pictures which
I have done it ages for beauty products
like a beauty flat lays for the new Dior
Beauty Collection sisters absolute
gorgeous for Christmas so I want it
again
a full blog post out for that we're
doing that Alex made breakfast he made
us crab an avocado on toast but it was
great I mean our coffees husband sorting
out my new Topshop video that's going at
my Topshop fail
hopefully seen that already if not con
my lips that she look blue gold you I
mean actually yeah the are critical but
blue yeah if you've not seen that
already pretty much I went into Topshop
it took me hours trying to find things
because it was just really hard work
can't find anything that I like that was
like really stylish or fashionable or on
trend and it was just like what the hell
has happened to Topshop so I decided to
make it into a bit of a Topshop whole
challenge challenging myself to find
some things I liked anyway so I really
really enjoyed putting that video
together in the end but I only kept like
two things from it so major fail to be
honest but if you're not seen that then
have a look click on screen and watch
that so we've just been doing that
getting that all ready for tonight and
now we're gonna go to the gym I'm
wearing another TLM top just because
these are just so easy to throw on
Square salon it's nice at the top of gym
tops just on the days that you don't
really want to show you belly as much
and I'm also wearing a factor shoots as
well these new sweaty Betty leggins
is very kindly sent minis in the mail or
fortunately resize small snow a little
big but they'll just be nice and comfy
for doing squats and lunches and things
in so and then also I'm wearing with a
grey Jim sharp brought up today hi guys
I have total ignored you all day I'm so
sorry I know I'm so so bad from where we
left so you went to the gym we went to
boot support teams for our Travel
immunizations can you believe that me
and Alex have been to Sri Lanka Maldives
Mexico Cuba we didn't even realize
Shanghai we've never had any travel
vaccinations it's ridiculous we've just
never thought about never thought about
it until someone who was it someone's
asked me about it
and I thought oh my god I've never
listened everything we thought about it
so bad if you go into any of these
places you need to get travel vaccines
so we finally finally booked in so what
do not tomorrow no we're not doing that
Tuesday then after that we came home I
just had a bit to be honest I just
wanted a bit of a chill day and a bit of
a day awful one I just been having my
own time and then Alex made an
absolutely delicious stir-fry lemongrass
and coconut you know bombs
yeah so this looks great for me to clear
up later we've now on a marathon of mind
hunter we're really getting into our way
well actually wouldnít pikemen I do my
favourite show so far whatever in ever
in life no I'm not ever put in that kind
of style of things yeah I don't usually
like this kind of like investigation
it's almost like a more modern accept
retro Sherlock Holmes isn't it I hmm I
guess I don't watch horror whatsoever
but this is his mother
thriller no even a thriller but it's a
spooky part but it's just about a few
people are doing investigations with
serial killers yes give it a wash so
we've literally watched about four of
those back-to-back now then I realize
that hadn't mentioned the fact that my
blog is 5 yes today today 22nd of
October is the day that I wrote
my first-ever blog post spirit was calm
yeah it's just an introductory thing it
switch to that paragraph long that says
this is going to be in the fro it's
coming my beauty fashion lifestyle blog
I hope you enjoy it
we're gonna have a glass of champagne
that's realized that we need to
celebrate praise it's like 10 o'clock on
a Sunday night you ready and I'm turning
hence why I look this bad we're having a
little celebratory champagne because
five years is crazy burn in mind I'm
like I'm twenty-eight five years it's
like almost like a sick of my life so
far as misspent on this blog yes so i'm
i'm currently tanning hence why i look
this way
I'm just tanning so I had a bath and
then I did I've just been tanning and
then we've been watching mind hunter so
I ages what is this no way Oh delicious
it's like 50 why not doesn't taste like
champagne maybe it's a Prosecco Oh
brilliant that's why we were an event a
few weeks ago and I tried that crystal I
know you wanted to try it like rappers
and step drink honest to god it wasn't
even that good and it tastes it no
difference no gray particulars just a
sweet a factor bubbly wine champagne is
drying so Prive you also wearing my
socks again you can turn them inside out
but I still know they're mine also a lot
of you guys don't seem to know that I do
blog Oh got this lighting and these red
cheeks I don't do me anything
I have Instagram or I youtube and that
is all I do
where's if anyone asks me what my
profession is I say fashion blogger
because that's what I started out
firstly in fact I actually started out
more as a beauty blogger
with the odd bit of fashion but
obviously my background is fashion with
the PhD and all of that also amazed me
after my last one of my last vlogs how
many of you guys didn't know I had a PhD
to be fair I don't mention it that often
although friends of mine probably would
say that did but I don't think I mention
it at all I often forget myself yes I
have a fashion PhD in fashion consumer
behavior I was a lecturer in fashion for
a while I started the blog when I was in
my second year at the PhD I had the blog
through the through being a lecturer and
then I gave up lecturing three years ago
seven full-time for three years and the
blog is five years old today so it's a
big feat I started to blog as a hobby
completely as a hobby back then no one
was doing it full-time anyway I wanted
it just a bit of fun and a lot of steam
and now it's my full-time career and I
guess I have so many people to thank for
that including you guys for the support
and yes so thank you guys
if you know checked out my blog in the
fro comm please feel free to head over
i've been mention it a lot recently but
I do have a newsletter over there so if
you're the kind of person who doesn't
like to read blogs often but has an
email address that you often check and
you are my little snippets of info and
updates it might be the perfect way to
keep up with all the videos I'm doing
all opposed I'm doing all the instagrams
and all the outfits etc and yeah if you
don't follow Alex
already then feel free to do that - he's
just at Harrison on Instagram and he
takes all of my pictures pretty much all
my pictures unless I'm not in them in

very exciting projects that I'm
currently working on that currently

you know thank you guys mm what morning

Monday morning now I mean I sit as
quickly going out to do some more
shooting for this project I'm working on
and then right after that I have a like
a panel session that I'm on with YouTube
and a luxury fashion trance so I'm going
over to the after after so I've kind of
had to think about what to wear for both
things to be appropriate but I'm on my
way now I've just posted my blog post
for my five year
which is super exciting gosh my turn oh
no oh yeah I just posted my five-year
anniversary post exciting and yeah
anyway but a head off so nice Hyde Park
in the autumn it's beautiful it's
ultimate dog goals as well everyone else
knows insane dogs around here we're
trying to brave the rain also I've had a
bit of a break hey ho
do what you can do and yeah but the rain
isn't fabulous so we're trying to like
hide in the trees and gack and get
footage under the tree just minutes the
YouTube space where my panel and
discussion is today and it's all been
done off it used to be like a train in
here and now it's like London vibes and
it's got this cute little cafe okay so I
realize but I haven't spoken to you in
some time
so I brought you back to my makeup I
brought you back to my bathroom I came
back to my bathroom this is a quick
hello I'm just looking for makeup I'm
really strong at the moment actually
with my skin again it what's happened I
went through such a good time with my
skin a little while ago but I think I've
just been a bit stressed recently and
it's showing on my face so yeah so just
had a few little breakout I'm trying to
take off my makeup a lot sooner in a day
but I shouldn't always happen that way
it isn't last time I saw you I was at
YouTube assisting a panel discussion
with a brand and YouTube just talked
about YouTube strategies I quite enjoy
doing that kind of thing because I love
to talk about strategies anyway so we
were just talking with this particular
brand about potential things that they
could do on YouTube in the future so
it's quite fun but it was like a three
hour things I didn't realize it's a food
thing I thought it'd be like an hour and
a half anyway went on till four and then
after that I came home and I just been
doing work all night and then I've just
come off the phone with my best friend
in Chicago
we're going over to Chicago again
actually at the end of November like we
did last year
psycho tradition now we go over and have
Thanksgiving as honorary British
American so just catch up with her and
see how she's doing fellas
and now I'm just going to take off all
the makeup have a shower
what is it Monday I thought I'd miss the
back off I'll clean up by the way isn't
this lovely I got this myself the other
day it's so pretty Navy blouse it comes
with a little cami underneath to protect
our dignity it's just gorgeous quality
it's beautiful so I'll leave this link
down below some rather fond you've got a
very Victorian Victoriana vibe to it
which I'm all about in the autumn gosh
I'm really I'm blowing this light anyway
guys I will leave you here and I will
guess I'll see you in the morning
morning guys today we have one last
photo shoot to do it'll all become clear
soon I'm doing like a three-part little
project so we're going out shooting
night this morning but I've also really
wanted to get a blog post up for the new
Christian Dior Christmas collection it
arrived and everything is absolutely
beautiful I've had two showed you it
didn't I showed written a blog
everything is gorgeous and I really
wanted to do like a really special
beautiful that is a really special blog
post about it so today I am putting
everything on and honestly I am
absolutely in love with it I'm a big fan
of Christmas collections anyway
especially I find that Dior and Chanel
do your Armani and you know do Christmas
collections better than most other
brands and honestly I find that they're
the callers that come out with and their
packaging and the whole thing is just
really really exciting and beautiful and
it's very giftable
and I was upset I fell in love with this
collection when it came in so I wanted
to do this so it's kind of quite
self-explanatory there I've done though
this onto the lid this to the outer
corner this you can see in the middle is
just actually amazing and then this
lighter pink I'm sweeping it through
this inner corner here and I'm putting a
little bit that lighter one up here on
the brow bone - so I'm just playing
around with these colors a little bit
really and honestly I must admit I think
I've said this to the girls at door
before but usually they're I shadow czar
what let down the collections I find
because previously they've been like
really non-pigmented
you can barely pick up any product the
colors are they're always nice but never
like mind-blowing the pigments in them
that aren't that incredible honestly
ever since Peter Phillips came into your
creative and make
ambassador he has to flip the whole
collection on their head and now
honestly the pigment it I mean look at
it though you can see the pigmentation
it can I speak for itself
I'm absolutely blown away like I'm let's
just dipping in getting some products
it's not flying everywhere it's not not
getting notice of the fallout in fact I
haven't wiped this once there's no
fallout here that's pretty pretty damn
good so I'm really really impressed by
this so far and then on my lips I've
just gone for a mixture two of the lips
I've gone for the deeper red which is
seven for one deep Ruby all over and
then it's a very center to make it more
pinky in the middle I've gone for six
seven one
vibrant tourmaline I've gone for those
two from the Christmas palette I've also
use a little now this is very golden
very very shimmery so I've just put a
little bit on top of my highlight and
honestly because if it's all over my
face it's gonna be a bit much I'm going
out shooting however my face today is
really I mean look at all this texture I
don't know where this is all come from I
think I've had a reaction to some of
them because I don't you should get that
kind of texture at all so I was hope it
works out for filming to be honest we
will see I sort of started quickly come
along and say hey apart from the
shooting today so go I'm not doing this
shoot today but apart from that all we
have to do today is we're going getting
vaccines to travel vaccines done we're
going over to boots and just get into
some vaccines John probably like
hepatitis A hepatitis B maybe typhoid
but I'll let you know and I'll let you
know how it goes I hate injections
absolu I will avoid injections at all
costs I hate them so I'm not looking
forward to this and honesty that like to
Quincy in a corner so no I feel very
vampiro we all this all of this makeup
on but it's very Christmas in it's very
lovely I think I'm definitely wear this
look for my Christmas Day and my
Christmas Eve in fact the day before
Christmas Eve we're having a big lovely
family meal going to like an Italian for
food so I may wear this a lot then
actually it's very nice yeah skin it's
not playing ball at moment happened soon
itself done this shoot I want to come
back and take everything off and a
Slytherin moisturizer I think got a few
comments about what I've been doing with
my eyelashes so I have had the Mel B
elde
I'm just gonna get them one last base
the difference with me my LVL is that
just for this one boost now they'll stay
up whereas if I don't have lvl they will
stay like that so this is the new
combination I've been using at the
moment it's actually the nouveau lucious
the guys that do me LBL they brought out
mascara this is to see enhancement a
mascara the thing about this is the
brush is really like hardened it almost
reminds me of a spoolie and it's quite
dry as well so I love this as the base
of my mascara right now it just brushes
through every single lash and very
lightly coats it but it almost just
keeps lashes looking really like
thickened down and like in the perfect
placement you know like like if you use
a spoolie on eyebrow brush or an eyelash
brush so but um first let's get the
overall shape and then I use the Dior
pump in volume and that gives me volume
thickness ultra black if you love thick
lashes you cannot go wrong with this
mascara honestly I mean you've got to be
careful because if I add another second
coat now then you're looking at like
crazy thick lashes crazy thick but that
for me works and then I've been using
this the Mac extended play lash because
they wand on this is absolutely tiny
teeny tiny so it's really handy for
getting into lower lashes and not
necessarily getting it underneath so I
realize that that is three mascaras to
do one eye but it's nice to mix it up
sometimes that's what it looks like
after those few coats are different this
car is so open and a little bit
