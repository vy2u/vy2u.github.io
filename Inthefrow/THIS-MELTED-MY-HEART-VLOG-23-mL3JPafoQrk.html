what I'm always alike today I have two
things on the agenda as I said yesterday
I'm going to the dentist to pick up my
retainer
because primary need it just in case
this sounds like a tiny little wire here
now
stuck on the back of these little move
and if I ever like break that and I
can't get to dentists in a few days I
need to emeritus officer nothing goes
back just one here retainer for that and
I'm also going to go see my

worn any makeup so that's why I look
this tired and sleepy but at least my
lashes look fabulous what this so much
yes so off we go
Victor is slightly under our LED light
machine LED light therapy and
light-emitting diodes and I can own last
low-level laser system we use Pacific
colors of light or wavelengths to
simulate different characteristics in
the skin or topics and characteristics
in the skin in this case we use in red
light which is particularly good for
anti-aging because it stimulates
collagen production and fiber block it
also helps prevent pigmentation and sun
damage this is a B light therapy there's
no downtime associated with shock
treatment at all you can have it is
regularly at once every week most people
have this treatment done prior to having
their Christmas Eve skin resurfacer
so I just got home to the amazing New
Deal collection that's just launched I
have these put on me last week when I
did my Dior shoe and they are beautiful

pretty cool actually more metallic
finish but stunning from the eyes these
