like myself and then home for lots and
lots of work yay oh also I've got to say
last night
they found my camera yeah so at this
point you've seen all the other vlogs
luckily it's almost like I've rewritten
the past now you've been getting this
camera back anyway I managed to get in
touch with green tomato and the guy
found my camera in his car thank
goodness because I had 12 days of
footage on that on that card on that
camera so that would have meant that you
would have been able to see my trip to
Bath to see the Mitchell acts whenever L
see my trip to San Tropez with Clarins
all the things in between so thank
goodness that this guy could find it
because it would have been a nightmare
that's not my way back from sketching ma
I rang green tomatoes and was like
please can you ask him to look in his
car he finally managed to get hold of
the driver and he found it so I was
certain this taxi like yeah so happy
explorin teen us Alex and I have
yes yes what else would I have for
breakfast apart from this Alex brought
us into fat face and now I'm buying
things

wanted a nice easy Haditha throw on
especially for the one traveling let's
treat myself did now I'll be also do
matching pants and I'm like should I

tracksuit we will see but I also got
these of the day who is in here today as
well my boat is big socks so happy to be
back home I had such a good time with my
mum it's so nice to see ya I've not seen
her in ages actually yeah she just came
over to so she could through the flat
and see me and Alex and hang out with us
for a little bit which was lovely and
that's why I wanted to kind of show her
ass my favourite places like pharmacy
and Darian's cafe and sketch - so she
can I see all these places that we go to
quite often and see what we're getting
up to with our lives
oh I don't feeling really travel sick
from the car home the rest of the day
it's gonna do some work wonders some
emails I'm gonna pretend to do some
filming though I'm not too sure I've got
the energy so I might just do some
emails and some blog posters instead by
the way how beautiful is this little
thing it's from the pom-pom shop I'll
leave it linked down below
I'm chef the gorgeous little Instagram
and she sends him anywhere and it's so
pretty
I've just been Tania my desk the past
God knows how long so I thought I'd say
hello so I'm just going through my
makeup collection I did have like a big
did have a big bag full of full of stuff
that I've just been kind of like putting
in the right place and so an hour and
then I thought but you know what I'll
also start looking at my drawers and see
what I have and what I can kind of like
disperse them sort out just found this
little cutie and I got some Bobby Brown
with a coverage with slip which do these
gorgeous night masks I love these so
much I always have a fake one
trying to pull the bins away I have a
pink one of these and I always have it
with me when I go on my big fights
because they're just really really
comfortable and because they're silk you
don't really get any I know those weird
Creasy lines on your face when you're
wearing them and that came with I can
see less full coverage concealers this
one looks like it was pretty good for me
beige really quite heavy yeah it's
definitely full coverage porcelain and
then this one is definitely dark for me
this one golden oh very nice and also
came with the brush coming up to their
collection
oh right beauty blondie I heard coach
will talk about this exact lipstick of
the day blondie really turn nude some
bite and also this was gorgeous Lotus by
a beaut
what kind of rediscovering all these
great lipsticks in here oh I've got
short till a beautiful fat lashes
fabulous
gorgeous products and I blender brush
that's nice
Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood lips
dangerous liaison that looks nice oh
it's just a really deep rich burgundy
shade actually really nice love the
texture of these it's just incredible
the texture is amazing I've got like
I've got like a whole bag of Chanel like
new Chanel products it's like all of the
rich cocoa glosses in here oh really
really needs sorting out a big time okay
oh also I haven't even had a chance to
try this yet the new Charlotte Tilbury
it's got big bar of chocolate goodness
mm-hmm wait to try that well I'm in a
bit of a nightmare cause I'm waiting
over today to get my camera back oh by
the way if you think I've got loads of
makeup on it's because I've been trying
out all the different products on my
face it's like something on my lips look
massive now because I'm like five layers
of matte lipstick on and then other
creams but that as I'm searching through
my drawers I found some glossing things
and honestly I'm really not into the
hype like everybody else's
everyone's really excited about this
brand it's just a little bit it's quite
cool it's a bit this is quite hipster I
guess so I've got a few bits that I
haven't tried yet
smoke each other cleanser I've heard
lots of people speaking about I'm gonna
try that later on I've got a seamless
cheek color in dusk right Coralie see
well this is a boot okay it's quite
creamy crack orally and also quite got a
bit of tan vibe to it nicely though it's
quite nice actually I'm gonna eat my
words here I do quite like I love Korean
blushes are especially ones that they
have more of a bronzey feel to them
aren't too over-the-top because I often
quite like just put in bronzer on my
cheek as well that's quite nice you want
to add that into my blush drawer yeah
okay then I've got this one what's this
telescope do effect highlighter and if
you can look at that color it's quite
cool Goldie rum all this um we only
worry with this so is that I've got such
a pale skin tone I mean this would look
amazing on dark skin tone so I'm not too
sure if it's like my bag it's nice yes I
just don't usually go for bronzy copper
chinks that's all feel it's a bit warm I
prefer the champagnes so nice I mean it
works nice and it looks quite nice and
creamy and gooey but I don't think I'll
be using that personally again
what's this skin South balm calm he's
all lips on cuticles on elbows on your
friends okay this is gonna be like thick
gel I'm sensing okay this is like thick
silicon II balmy gel feels really nice
so hmm yeah okay I'm gonna keep huh
I'm gonna keep that in my little area
thanks to you a lot and I also got was
this is by brow I think senior glossy
team sent me all needs to try so it's
pretty cool so nice little brush it's
quite a nice color as well I do already
have a bit of brow product on by the way
oh yeah quite like that it's quite a
blonde brown
what if it's always the same Cornell
seasoned blonde
well I can't no I have to keep easier
but all right so I'm gonna give this a
go later and I'll let you know how I get
on
yeah but things are really really tight
in here now I'm very very pleased
actually very pleased by the way this is
a new Hoodie
I got it today from a fat face it's a
really easy simple little hoodie
it does look quite cute in store so
thought go for it although I hate it
when oldies get too baggy around the
back I like it when they sort of sit
here like this I'm gonna do that a new
addition to my desk I don't ever ever
want to light is amazing so my favorite
scent is the Armani Rouge malachite this
is the candle to match it's so amazing
so amazing so this is the scent and this
is a candle sick little little queue up
so I likes no lighting that candle ever
please yeah everything is looking
awesome I've got these I've just found
all these lovely lipsticks in my drawer
so I'm gonna try and go through each one
because of some of our gasa our glass
why sell there's some bite
Smashbox it Alaska and then decay not
enough decay shot till Briana use a bit
more got this all sorted out as well got
my brushes and all my other bits and
bobs this is a bit messy but hey yeah
yeah looking forward to trying that I
think it's just like the packaging is
super cute and the logo is pretty
adorable and I was like just about to
start shooting and taking pictures of
this Marc Jacobs collection for a blog
