really well this video is going to be my
top five bags for the autumn I mean I
love collecting bags as you guys know
and there are particular bags that you
often find you reach for for different
seasons betting on the color to put on
the textures fabric the hardware color
size the shape what you kind of feelings
that day so I thought seeing as there's
been a few bags I've reached for the
most over the past few weeks
I thought kind of round them up into my
top five bags just to mention as well
because I know for a fact that I will
look back at this video and the future
and think what was that little cooler
this is Charlotte Tilbury Dali Bird
Hollywood lips it's amazing and just to
kind of ombre a tiny bit I've put a bit
of the bareMinerals
Gen nude in slay to the center so tiny
bit but generally it's just the
Hollywood lips liked anyway moving on
into the first bag first bag I wanna
give a mention to is this absolute babe
this bag is from strawberry and it's
that east/west mini bag
now this is in the kind of creamy white
shade they do lots for the shades let me
show you I do also have its red this is
in the medium and this is the mini just
so you can get a bit of a size
comparison stress free is a brand that I
have adored ever since I first started
blogging I got to meet those guys back
when I was back in Manchester I'd been
blogging maybe four or five months and I
went along to event and I got to meet
them and I was blown away by the styles
and designs of their bags and back then
they were quite small company they were
still growing they're looking at ways to
grow and I absolutely adored what they
stood for and what they were doing and
their styles and it's amazing to see how
far they've come at this point because
their designs and their bags and the
quality is absolutely incredible and I
have a lot a lot of respect for and I
love them so this is the east/west mini
anyway and it's just beautifully made
the quality is exceptional the quality
of these bags rivals the thousand pound
plus bags that I have no joke it's
absolutely beautiful just it just opens
up with a little flap inside it's got a
couple of compartments now I know a few
people have been asking me what I can
fit in this bag this is my iPhone 7 plus
with a case and this fits snug nice and
snug in there without any you don't have
to like
nothing and it just goes incomplete
pretty easily but that's the kind of
size you're looking at so as well in
here I would have my camera I'd have my
keys I'd have a couple of lipsticks you
know that kind of deal so actually it
actually fits quite a bit in here but
it's the cutest little bag I love it to
bits if you saw my vlog of the day
you'll have seen Alec says this is his
favorite bag of mine ever so I think
that says it all so I'll leave links
down below we can get these next up
after looking at my collection this bag
I think is gonna get a lot more love
again for this autumn winter this is a
Gucci Marmont in the velvet teal this
would go out stop for quite a while and
it did come back I'm pretty sure it's
still in stock now but since then they
brought out Louis different colors have
got an incredible Navy Wang which is
just stunning very beautiful bright
violet violet of purple shade that seen
quite a lot of different bloggers have
like Sammy
Tanny I think has one as well love that
back to bits but this is the one that I
got quite a while ago must be over a
year and a bit ago now that I got this
done get it well it's the rich color
tones it's the rich fabrics velvet that
makes this very kind of autumnal wintery
it's great it's an event bag I just got
a little Gucci bag stuffed inside there
for when I need it but it's got quite a
lot of room inside there and a long
strap as well so you can wear it
crossbody but I just wanted to mention
it I do think this is gonna be in my top
five or terminal bags this year this bag
I have mentioned almost too much now but
let's be honest it is the color of the
season and it's just absolutely
beautiful it's the coach Selena Gomez
and collaboration bag leather with suede
sides and it also comes to long strap as
well but it's just got so much room in
here I've used this for traveling I can
fit my 13 inch MacBook in here carry
around with me as luggage it's got lots
of lovely details on it here such as
like the Selena Gomez signature and on
the bottom here it says love yourself
first love yeah love yourself first I
only noticed that a few weeks ago when I
dropped my bag and saw the bottom of it
I was like oh it's just very very
beautiful it's a very beautifully made
great quality bag and fall the felt this
is obviously coach and it's got a lot of
room to it and it's a lot going on here
it's actually quite an affordable
premium back I think it's great I had to
mention this one because I couldn't
think of a more autumnal looking bag in
my collection right now and
from Anya Hindmarch this one I made as
part of her build a bag service you've
probably seen this mention a few videos
now but quickly run through it again
it's the Anaheim arch it's almost like a
bucket bag the idea is that you choose
the bag that you like and I got this one
that's two-toned so it's suede one side
and a gorgeous oxblood leather on the
other side and then you kind of build it
up so you can bite you get strapped you
can buy yourself different charms to
come off the side you can buy it or the
longer straps you kind of build the bag
the way you like accordant your
customization and and personal
preferences so this is what I created
and I love using this bag it's got so
much room in here if I'm going doing
projects and jobs I can stick my massive
camera in here as well as my vlogging
camera and everything else it's great is
a travel bag obviously because it's got
loads of room but otherwise I also sluff
just kind of carrying it with this strap
with it's very cool heart strap as well
it's like to kind of carry it around in
my hand device as well to me it screams
out um no it's got so many beautiful
colors in here that are very on terminal
and it's beautifully made so I love it
and the last bag to mention I know I
mentioned this in my new in luxury items
video but it is this one from Chloe it's
Chloe backpack and it's most definite
gonna be like one of my most worn or
torn up bags just fact it's so rich in
the colors in the dark navy and suede
and the gold but also cuz it's a
backpack and then we're taking this on
all my travels with me around the states
different places here and there before
Christmas and after Christmas as well
it's just a really great shape the thing
I love the most about this bag actually
is that you can hold it like this with
this draft it comes with a secondary
strap so you can hold like this I can
put it over your arm and wear it more
like a pocket bag style or you can take
that off if you want and then you can
wear it as a backpack these did actually
go down here but I took them off and
placement the side just so it would hang
lower on my back and also it's a little
bit more comfortable that way but
honestly I'm so so smitten with it this
was just a big treat to myself and I'm
so in love with it I'm really really
glad I got it so again it's gonna be one
of my most worn bags this season and I
can't wait to keep wearing it so those
the top five bags in my collection right
now that I am loving the most especially
for the kind of more autumnal months
generally because of their textures and
their fabrics and also the color schemes

lot of my outfits for autumn especially
