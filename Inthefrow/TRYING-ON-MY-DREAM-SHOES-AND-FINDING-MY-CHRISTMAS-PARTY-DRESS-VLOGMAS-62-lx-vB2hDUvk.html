all of this to do a big a sauce party
where Hall so when I need that to be I'm
gonna actually check those first off if
everything is in this bag
17 okay everything is here
I'm not gonna show you the snail oh I
want to be surprised when you actually
watch the eighth hole okay next up on my
things that arrived today I had some
vouchers has been a Luiza Via Roma you
guys build up point from the weed very
omits like a pipe system and when you
get a certain amount you can kind of
redeem the points and you get like cash
award so I had some cash awards to you
so I treated myself to something I don't
have which is a pair of classic plastic
oh my god classic Manolos in the pink
thread I'm gonna try down my Cinderella
moment I really hope you can't see
mother for me oh my god oh my gosh
they're absolutely beautiful
oh wow honestly I don't think I've put
on a shoe and felt this in love with it
in a very very long time
which you prefer this one this one
they're absolutely amazing absolutely in
like amazing let me show out let me go
baby paper look at my new shoes how nice
aren't they beautiful babe yeah they're
quite they're very classic a very
sophisticated elegant classic shoes
they've got this like silver thread
let's run it through the pink I'm just
gonna try on oh oh god I'm just gonna
try on the other shoe just a double
double double check that and definitely
a size four and I don't need a three and
a half so beautiful I can't believe it's
taken me this long so nice nice next
like little Cinderella slippers
so happy and for some reason I've never
picked up a pair of these like linen
like classic Manolos before because I've
never managed to find the right color
come in so many different colors and
fabrics and I've always looked and loved
them but never found the color that I
absolutely adored until I saw these I'll
leave a link down below for exactly
where you can get them from in this
exact color way then alternate how to
treat myself to some new things from
forte things that I kind of bought
thinking I might send potentially sent
back if I wasn't overly sure about them
but I thought they were just some not
any pieces for the winter
this one is this skirt from da Cheng
Gabbana it's super silky and lovely it's
really quite light this new rose print
I thought the cute little body tucked in
or even like a black cashmere knit to
kind of mix up with textures it could be
really nice so I'm going to try that on
and see why I need a dress for the gleam
Christmas party so I thought this one
from when my face self portray of course
how gorgeous this is absolutely
beautiful so beautiful there is some one
to the dress I wore last night though I
feel the fashion awards like super
similar but to try it on with you I
think it's very very me that's really
really gorgeous I have to throw it
another one actually I wasn't sure and
it's actually another self portrait
dress but very very different and
they're different colors so I might have
to ask you guys to help me decide which
one to keep and one to have I love this
things I saw it online as it guys so me
and it's a high neck cutout shoulder
blouse I like it I love this top this is
so great it's got its like peplum frill
and big like bell sleeves and it's like
we'll be cash it don't think it's
cashmere but it's lovely knit such a
cool shape the cutout shoulders this is
an absolute keeper I mean this is
gorgeous it fits perfectly this dr.
skirt it's super silky and Tobias I
didn't know if it would be
ElkY or a different fabric and because
it's silk am a little bit worried that
it won't be able to keep its shape the
same I might get ruined but maybe I just
need to see it with some heels on and a
little top maybe because I'm wearing
this knit with it it's throwing me off a
bit do you like it I'm just not sure
whether this is an absolute keeper I
love it
this dress is absolutely gorgeous it
really is like the details the lace work
the fabric absolutely gorgeous it's got
this lovely slit in it it's great but I
feel like if you're not showing your leg
in the split I feel a little bit like a
Victorian Victorian mistress you know I
I'm a Victorian like schoolteachers a
little bit and also it's quite long even
I've got some heels on it's still on the
floor and that would book me so as
beautiful as it says it's not right for
this occasion well it's nearly 11:00 and
I've spent hours just staring at my
computer liking comments replying to
comments from everyone who's left me the
most insane incredible messages I've
literally been like wiping away tears
trying not to get my eyelashes wet still
my he'll be on camera lashes work but
I've been low and then my mom left me a
really lovely comment on my Instagram
just to say like how proud she is of Ben
oh god don't get emotional again
honestly I can't believe like the
response like sometimes it's it's hard
to feel like you're in such a silo in
this career that you saw saty desk and
you're doing these things and you've got
cool things coming up and chatting to
you manages and that's all you're
speaking to all day and then you kind of
forget what you've what you're doing and
what you've actually done and what
you've accomplished already and the
challenges you've got over and what you
want you've got coming out and it's
something I just need to take a step
back I think sometimes I realize that
how much I am actually doing it fitting
into my days and on those days that I'm
really hard on myself and I'm like you
know doing well enough you're not good
enough I need to kind of get a list out
and be like why you did this recently
and did this and this was cool and this
is what you've got to look forward to
anything I think I need to do I think we
all need to do that and let me give
ourselves more of a pound
but for the cool things that we do that
we don't give ourselves quite absolutely
and by the response it's just a bit
insane like amazing it's Ted Baker's
just a brand I love so much and I've
just worked with them so many times and
for them to kind of believe in me and
support me and be like we want you to be
like the face of our campaign it just
means the absolute world so so I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna go to bed feeling
super elated now which is really really
nice so they're gonna go get a quick
shower and get in bed with Alex and just
chill out the Koch brothers late last
now I don't want to be on my computer
for much longer so I'm just gonna
complete the clock off now I mean it is
11:00 I mean it's ridiculously late I
think many other people work until 11:00
at night but clock off now and go pull
go to see about half 12 after I've kind
of settled a bit I will see you in the
morning
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
