and new setting I have just moved into
my new London flat finally I am in the
south where it's gonna be so easy for me
to work and see people go to events I'm
so excited about future now so I moved
in yesterday I've unpacked everything
everywhere it took me a long long time
but I think I'm all unpacked now so I
thought I would film this video for you
so my last video was a December
favorites video telling all about my
favorites for the last month yeah I
really want to get a full year review
kind of video done like a lot of other
people have done a full 2014 favourites
video so that's what this is going to be
I'll try to get through it as fast as I
possibly can because quite a lot of
things here in different categories this
is just a way for me to tell you about
every different product type and which
is my absolute favorite for the year so
let's get on with it I'm going to start
with skincare this we can start start
with a skin and work our way through
from there this thing is the waterproof
eye makeup move up from Vichy the pure
itza mouth I've talked about this before
it's the best one for taking off
waterproof eye makeup I feel worked
really really well for me and I've
constantly got back to this one my
favorite nighttime kind of moisturizer
and I feel something it's really helped
my skin the last few months especially
has been the Clinique super serum it's
very expensive it's about 50 pounds per
tube which is a lot of money however it
is fantastic at working miracles with
your skin in terms of dark spots bad
pigmentation blemishes and things like
that so I've really loved putting this
on every single night so big winner for
me over the night time my other favorite
as it was last year is the regen cream
still massive favourite for me cannot do
any wrong with this it's like 3 or 4
pounds per top absolutely loads in it
it takes ages to go through so you don't
need too much in your face it's amazing
at removing blemishes any things that
don't really want on your skin it's
amazing at removing so I absolutely
adore this so so much the serums my
favorite has got to be the Hydra Laura
and I've used quite a few recently but
this is the one that I think I won't be
repurchasing especially because for the
price it is one of the best I apply this
underneath my moisturizer every single
day and often on those days and I don't
want to put on anything at all just
because it just boosts the skin it just
adds extra hydration and it's just
wonderful so this has greatly helped my
skin again this year and it's a massive
winner but something else with skincare
not necessarily for face so it's this
hand cream from hand chemistry extreme
hydration concentrate to enforce an
active complex I understand it's
absolutely beautiful on the hands and I
put it on every single night before bed
and it just helps to soften and it keeps
them so hydrated let my my skin on my
hands feels so wonderful
so this is something I will definitely
be repurchasing over and over okay so
make up let's start with skin fair
favorite primer of the year has been the
Wonder glow from Charlotte Tilbury this
is almost like gold beans in a bottle
you put it onto your face it hydrates
moisturizes primes but also adds his
beautiful kind of golden sheen to the
skin so that when you then apply your
foundation at the top it just kind of
illuminates and height and just makes it
look really radiant and glowing it's
beautiful and also if you mix this in
with your foundation it works just as
well that way as well but this is kind
of a well-kept secret I feel really
really good foundations it was so so
hard to choose and if you saw my
favorite foundations video that I did a
few weeks ago you'll have seen some of
my mega favorites however I had to go
for the very very number one spot and
that's the Laura Mercier silk cream it's
the one I go back to for the biggest
occasions and more special events I know
it doesn't upset my skin it's the most
flawless finish and it's just absolutely
beautiful to fly so this is a big big
favorite for me for concealer again
there's been a lot of concealer size a
lot
and loved and loved but this is the one
that I am obsessed with and it's the
Clarins instant concealer I have it in
zero one and it's a beautiful shape to
me I found that so many people are now
using this I'm not surprised because
it's so so good
it illuminates brightens also such
flawless coverage as well so covers all
your dark circles because anything else
on your face that you want covered and
it looks doesn't look cakey it looks so
natural while doing it so this is just
the best of the best the powder on top
of that of course you'll know already
hourglass powder I got the one in
ethereal light and it's on the ambient
lighting powder
I've hit powerless I don't have to
repurchase soon and I will be doing it's
by far the best powder it's so light and
so firmly Mills that when you apply it
over to the concealer it doesn't cake it
it just works so beautifully in the skin
as if it was part of the skin so I could
not recommend this more and use it every
single time I do my makeup for contour
there were two favorites really I know
that's kind of cheating what kind of I
felt one was one half of the year and
one with either half and it is these two
the first half of the year from January
to June time I'd say it was this the
Illamasqua sculpting powder duo which
again I've hit pan on a highlighter it's
just so easy to throw in your bag it's
got both products in there the colors
are amazing they're so natural and you
can create such a beautiful contour with
them and the only reason I stopped using
that was because I then bought this
which is a Charlotte Tilbury film-star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow which looks like the
beautiful girls bar another series is so
often with the contour and highlight
shade which again are absolutely perfect
it's not too too orangey
and it's not too ashy it's just that
perfect middle ground color and the
highlight is so radiant and glowing and
catches like so beautiful only cheeks
it's just absolute winners that both are
absolutely beautiful I said this was
slightly less expensive than this one
but they both do an absolutely wonderful
job I like them this one's a little bit
more Raschi I'd say
this one but still beautiful and
therefore might as well move on to
bronzers and again I have to and again
it's because it's kind of half through
the year and I couldn't really decide
especially if one is more High Street
and want it more designer luxury so
first one for the first half year has to
be the soap and glory solar powder and a
stumbled upon miss really I don't know
how I got my hands on it or why I picked
it up but I did and I used it
repetitively for months and months and
months
I hit pan on it and usually when a hit
pan sometimes get a little bit on the
font of a product I've gone to something
else but I should just rebuy it instead
if I feel that way it's a wonderful
product I've got the bronzer with a
highlighter on either side but the
highlighter isn't to highlight tea it's
almost just a lighter shade of brown
with a bit of gold specks so when you
mix the two together it just
illuminating a radiant and beautiful
then I picked up the Estee Lauder bronze
goddess bronzer which is absolutely huge
beautiful thick mirror out she's super
easy generally if I'm on the go I'll use
this as my mirror to do my makeup in
because it's so big and again it's just
got a perfect bronze shade you like
you've been on holiday wearing this it's
it's just perfect there's nothing I can
say about bronzer that it just works
really really well
so these two a great ones much more
expensive what's not so expensive and
they're both brilliant an additional
highlighter that I did want to mention
because it's fast become my absolute
favorite and that is the hourglass
ambient lighting powder of course you
can use it for all types of different
things it's powered on the end dim light
is much more bronzy so I use that over
the top of my bronzer just as like kind
of below to it but the other two
especially this one in the middle which
is incandescent light I think is
absolutely beautiful
as a cheek highlight it's just wonderful
so see your started using it last month
our sold sold straight away and it fast
became an absolute favorite so this
palette in itself is just wonderful for
the eyes this was really difficult I
have so many different palettes and so
many different eyeshadows and you've got
so many four colors it's hard to say
which is your favorite but I've got to
say that when I reach for the most and
the one that makes me most excited to
use it if the lorac Pro palette you get
eight matte shades it's an eight
shimmers and it's just the perfect
palette for creating are different types
of more neutral looks more smokey looks
as well and more natural daytime locks
so butter to apply on the eyes so
blendable you cannot go wrong with this
favorite eyeliner I've not got it with
me ever need to buy a new one but I'll
show you this one which is slightly the
same it's by eyeko and it's a magic
liquid eyeliner it's wonderful it's got
a really fun nib you can twist up at the
very bottom and a small product or you
can create such a perfect cat eye with
it favorite mascara this will come as no
surprise but it's a Clarins
intense waterproof split date you need
to buy a new one probably one of those
mascara that you look at it and think
looks okay but as soon as you start
using it it separates it lengthens
it holds the curl but an any mascara
I've ever used and I need that with my
straight eyelashes as I said a thousand
times before sorry to keep repeating
myself on that point but it's so good so
yeah highly recommend this one for the
brow again this is a difficult one and
know that 2014 was the year off the brow
and we were all trying to create that
perfect brow look so much and finally I
got to the point where I was super happy
with my brow routine and it's due to
this which is the Anastasia dip brow
pomade I use mine in soft brown
got a very kind of gel cream formula so
that when you apply it onto a brush and
onto your eyebrows you've just got the
right amount of product and you can keep
working away and working your way and
adding more and more and more and it
just makes your eyes look great and
they'll stay put because this is kind of
like a gel so as soon as this sort of
sets in place and that's kind of it and
I'm just really like this packaging as
well I think it's really really cute and
I enjoy using it as well so by far this
is my favorite brow product of 2014
favorite blusher again this might not be
a surprise but it's a cheap to chic
swish and pop washer from Charlotte
Tilbury and this is the one in first
look there's just something so subtle
and natural about the shade in the store
emember looking at it and looking at a
thing is this even gonna show up on my
cheeks it's very very light but then as
soon as started using it I realized just
how beautiful it was too cheap it gave
such a natural kind of blush but you can
build it up to be a lot dark if you want
to especially with this darker shade in
the middle the wonderful I cannot
recommend this any more
moving on to the lips I'm going to start
with the product that I wasn't sure on
at first and then I got into it and now
I was reading a little bit and it's a by
Terry Baume De Rose and I've got this in
Rosie babe so it's so much more rosy
shade and pinky shade I love just to
apply this sometimes on days on its own
and it really looks like it's plumping
the lips and it has that very bein a
pink Sheen to them really really cute oh
I love this underneath the lipstick as
well just make sure my lips stay
hydrated and look really really plumped
and beautiful now this is really really
expensive it's about 35 pounds this
little one so I would say my other
absolute favorite this year is of course
comics as I always always use it so it's
been comics or by Terry so it's our 35
pound or 2 pound I absolutely love this
and again it's hard to choose favorite
lip colors of the year but I'm just
gonna go through the ones that I
probably use the most and they are these
two got one from Mac and one from
Illamasqua the Mac one is completely
covered in this lipstick
but I love them all that clean you up
there we go
I'll clean cream cup it's just such a
lovely new D baby pink shade just really
really lovely and also from Illamasqua
it's corrupt which I'm wearing now and
if you see me ever wearing a really kind
of favorite pink it's usually corrupt I
just love it so much
who it's much more matte so it's up to
you if you want to go for much more edgy
matte lip perfect if not put some
Carmack's on drip or some comics over
for it but lip gloss over it and hey
presto it's not as not anymore
so you can always mix it up but in terms
of colors corrupt I absolutely adore
that especially with my hair color
especially my hair is a little bit
lighter and cream cop is my everyday
wear lipstick so those two I absolutely
love so my favorite fragrance of the
year I had a lot of contenders in this
one but I've got to stick with my roots
and that's for the flower bomb stick to
Ralph extreme so the flower bomb extreme
it's the sort of more nighttime extreme
version as they like to call it it only
comes in 50 ml which is very 9 because
the 50 mil that's like 70 pounds so it's
ridiculous but it smells absolutely
incredible fat or not but now I just
find a love flower bomb but I found that
sometimes it's quite candy and very
sweet whereas I feel this one it's just
a bit richer the smell isn't quite as
tingey and tangy and sweet those sweet
notes that tough it's got something a
bit more rich about it I feel and I've
used this I've worn this for absolutely
years and I will not stir it in terms of
tools I have two particular types of
tools that I want to mention I did
mention in the day but I'm absolutely in
love with the Real Techniques
NYX picks brushes they're incredible
they're wonderful but something tangy my
absolute favorites which has to be these
and they are the zoeva rose gold edition
regardless of whether they're rose gold
or not these have just brilliant
brilliant brushes they come in a little
pouch I'm pretty sure I'm missing one
here
but I just picked up a few toys to show
you the common is set and I have used
these so much for example the blush
brush is my favorite blush brush perfect
shape the foundation brush well this is
a silk finish brush Jesus is my
foundation buffing brush and it's a
miracle worker the face shape is perfect
I found for concealer or just for any
little extra buffing the looks petit
crease brush perfect for getting soft
Anna Lilla section for the eyes the look
soft definer is just like the Mac tomb
on 7 and is an amazing blending brush
and then you've also got the winged
liner which is the thinnest liner brush
ever for doing weight a winged liner and
whatever you started a little bit more
pricey you may pay for all the cheaper
sets and boots but they are highly worth
it and also look beautiful final tool
that I had to mention was the Real
Techniques sponges I've got two of these
now this one's nice quickly and I think
but they're just an absolute godsend
especially to concealer I use this just
to put concealer in my own eyes and then
I wet this button and I'll go all under
it and it just works a product into your
skin better than any brush ever cod my
concealer it's metal at my flawless and
when I started using these so I could
not rave about this anymore and about
seven pounds so you definitely need to
invest in one they're amazing and we'll
end this video with hair because I do
love some good hair products so first of
all volume it's all about mousses now
I've had quite a few different types I'm
not saying this is my favorite I've had
quite a few different taxes here the GHD
volume foam mousse amazing the Paul
Mitchell sculpting phone mousse amazing
this one is the BB thickening full four
moves again amazing any type of mousse
those three especially and also got a
Schumer art of ugh auras think it's
called
amazing again so any kind of volume
making foam is an absolute winner I just
add a sort of tennis ball-sized to my
hands rub it together to my hair upside
down run it through all of my hair and
the roots blow dry it upside down
and you just get so much volume
amazing so I can't live now without
volume things so this is a brilliant one
one of the reasons I keep it in such
good condition it's due to this product
definitely hands-down one of the best
products of this year Moroccan oil I
think it's awesome on the best approach
to last year as well it's just fantastic
the bottles about 30 pound this size but
you only need a tiny bit at once I
probably going through this bottle now
for about five months six months and
it's only halfway down it lasts for Aug
so you need a tiny little amount and add
it just to the ends of my hair when the
wet work in a massage in spin a blow
dryer I just found the ends of my hair
feel so much softer and smoother and
nowhere near as broken as we might have
been a couple years back
so total godsend and we've come to the
end those are all of my favorites of the
previous year 2014 was an amazing if me
I achieved so much and it was just
really really fun year so I'm hoping
that 2015 is just as amazing if not even
better so I hope you all had a great
2014 and a wonderful new year into the
2015 I will be creating a lot more
