joined by Alex I'm sure you've seen them
so many rooms in different vlogs and
thanks especially my Florida vlog you in
that lifetime so you're probably feeling
quite a few times and we're just kind of
chilling with our Saturday and we're
actually making some soup so I thought
well waiting for our hour worth of
baking feet tomatoes and put nut squash
we're going to do the boyfriend tag hmm
so many times people have asked me for
this because you want to know more about
Alexson and how I'm not that interesting
well so yeah yeah we do these tags that
hopefully you enjoy it I've gone through
YouTube trying to find the questions for
this tag and so many people either
haven't written the actual questions
answered and it's only really Sammy you
crush obviously he wrote down it's
written a few and then someone else is
written even more so I'm gonna gonna
choose a few of my favorite questions
from a few different videos like this
okay let's get one where did we meet
originally oh yeah yeah okay where was
our kind of first meeting where we were
attracted and we were in a st. hallo
yeah thanks Rallo if anyone knows saying
so everyone gesture um cool kids go back
yeah yeah it's a rock club so it's quite
my darkened engine paper mache Devils
and stuff everywhere
it's my random but it's few cheap drinks
and stuff isn't it so we we went there
and how did you win me
I asked you on the day that was there
yeah it took me about six weeks to
actually get you out of there I'm a
message in like all the time I think was
Facebook I was pestering fence oh yeah
those differences definitely look it's
definitely test you on Facebook for a
while until you got my him then I was
trying to get you out yeah because I
liked used to be it's like proper like
cool kid easy on myspace and it's like
all on MySpace yeah well yeah but you
will I feel a cool kid on MySpace
so what I never thought that you'd like
ever find me attractive or like me so I
just saw is when you fail come out for
drinks so this you think these want to
be that friendly that's why you brought
about six guys that were yours make
better when I lied I know what a guy
makes at that point so yeah so that's
how we met what was our first date and
what is the Garrett was that the first
one yeah yeah when you were absolutely
family yeah yeah yeah yeah so we want to
be Garrett for a few drinks and this one
and bit of getting absolutely told ya no
no we did we went Guerra after it if we
went to my first you went to when
micellar undies Gate locks Mozilla did
for anyone that's remember that you'll
probably like get this so much easier
than everyone else
vo went Irwin to Missoula I'm Dean skate
logs back when it wasn't quite Chevy's
now yes horrible yeah and we went for
like food and drinks and we on our first
day yeah but I had a full bottle of wine
to myself cuz I sounds probably bit
nervous as well I wanna start chattin
and we doin live a few hours trying yeah
and then we left we went to a book
called the Garrett and I was just
absolutely through your drink or
somebody than you know what no what you
don't from the up into them
alright you spilled your drink well I I
washed I go up there I got animated as I
did I see now with my hands and I
thought well and like smash my wine
across his table of like scary-looking
guy - 9 th top of the calm so sorry she
just a little save the day didn't I yeah
you say the day I know bobble it was so
cute maybe my anymore okay next one
first impression of me ever
oh yeah okay let's do it that's why this
thing we've known each other since we
were like 16
so it's I want to start game when we
look 2021 yeah so there's like a whole
five years in between when we knew each
other yeah we did day yeah
so what was your first impression of me
when you first ever clocked eyes on it
years ago yeah I thought you beautiful
oh and uh yeah I don't know it was just
one of those things it was just I really
like you but I don't figure out my
league so yeah you thought that's a lot
of it me you thought it was just too
cool yeah to cool school in that year
and that you've not ever might like me
in that way when did you meet the family
that's kind of unfair um did you meet my
mom first
yeah yeah yeah I think I came around for
dinner a thing yeah cuz I remembered
like a it was it was in summer at some
point and I rock god like we're in the
past and I didn't realize we're having
dinner and I I just looked like I've sat
around you has been a table wearing it
like a wife beater
put all my tattoos a absolute
idiot the moon was lovely though I mean
she was she was great so I was wrong she
loves me though we have a tradition get
walking dead and Game of Thrones
estrogens yeah yeah yeah like every
night I comes out it's yeah yeah we sit
we said we'll go make food and we'll get
some soft dessert I will sit watch no
phones no nothing yeah no phones and no
nothing and we watch game affairs are
Walking Dead we just sort of sit and we
watching but now watching dad although
daredevil it's in all sighted watch life
so good really good it's so good he said
I love you first and where was it how
you said it
he was salad again it was it my birthday
was not my baby you would help you were
drunk wasn't that my 21st birthday yeah
might have been thank you I think I was
Karen yeah I think are you okay your
piggyback or something home because you
were too drunk or you'd be with her
okay don't get drunk that often but it
was my birthday I was allowed to have a
little bit more drink responsibly
yeah you're giving me a piggyback yeah
see you the first one that's all I know
I love you and I said listen I want you
to show up you were drunk well then it
was another day after you said it to me
it clear like you tell me you love me
last night is a snit yeah you want you
feel mean to me what do we argue about
the most I think we both know that you
need times and not be announcer sure
this one's a workaholic so I know you
might think like plugins like a really
easy job but it's like seven days a week
24/7 so it's hard to try and get just a
long time without phones and because you
just constantly you love it you work
hard and stuff so yeah so but I mean
sure enough can be a problem sometimes
garnet yeah yeah I do struggle with it
kind of cuz I love getting like work
done and blog posts out and instagrams
and videos edited and whatnot but it can
take a lot of time I'm up which means
that's less time to spend together
so that's play the thing we argue about
the nice button it's all good
don't worry about with people he wears
the pants in their relationship I mean
we both gotta like each you know let me
know buddy I think that's what we lock
horns a lot with pretty good strong
personalities of myself yet yeah neither
words will roll over let you the wrong
wind Crafton I don't know I like you
when sometimes just for the sake of yeah
I don't let you win yeah and just forget
about it I know we have a Kiki man we do
yeah we go out to eat what do I get to
drink white what yeah Oh water yeah what
