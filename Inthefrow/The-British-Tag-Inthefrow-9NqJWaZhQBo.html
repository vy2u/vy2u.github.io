the British tag let's go how many cups
of tea do you have a day in how many
sugars well in my Starbucks San
Francisco mug and my little Disick straw
I'm drinking water I don't drink tea I
haven't drank tea since I was a baby I
don't drink coffee the only hot drinks I
drink a hot photo or hot chocolate I
don't know if that makes me not that
British or not whether it just means
that I don't have a taste in tea I don't
know but I don't like it's horrible it
tastes so bland
there be te and I like so I have water
generally I had to drink water or I
drink wine or a drink martini martini
anyway off-topic favorite part of your
roast oh god I love roast dinner my mom
makes the best roast dinner how soft mom
if you're watching I'd have to go for
save someone took away all the different
parts in the roast dinner and left one
it would have to be the option pudding
hands-down my mom makes the best
Yorkshire pudding and I fall to see what
I have to say I am pretty good at the
old job she put him other than that I'd
also say roast beef horseradish Parmesan
parsnips mashed potato me only with
cream and butter forget the milk get the
cream in there get the full fat bingo
favorite dunking biscuit if I had a hot
chocolate
what would I don't I love nice biscuits
I love Bob and biscuits around me of my
granddad l it's like it it's a little
biscuit that you will always get you're
always getting in with like coffees and
I can almost like a gingery taste but
not gingery like
oh well let me know in the comments if
you know what they are hopeful I can
remember but yes they are good favorite
quintessentially British pastime I'd say
a British pastime definitely something
is going down when it's sunny and
getting a drink on a terrace or in a bar
outside and have a drink I love doing
that I do hate the fact that it gets so
busy though because everyone wants to do
it and everyone's like oh oh my god it's
actually sunny get out the house so yeah
I do hate that but it is so nice to be
able to go out and do that I remember
it's summertime me and my boyfriend took
a trip back to my hometown took like a
train ride to get there so we could just
sit out on like a bench overlooking a
canal with a beautiful spike countryside
around us Claire don't get that in mind
we did that and all the family came and
met notes and it was one of the best
days of this year so far
amazing and what else do people do
oh cool now getting like punt Strongbow
or a cup a big a record and excited to
sit out in sunshine my play say that was
my favorite part that favorite word I
really liked ignoramus I remember one
time one said she called that to someone
I just ate melted my heart because I've
sailed before to say very much more
insulting words to someone if they were
upset with it but my mom said ignoramus
I thought it was just absolutely
adorable and extremely British offer
nincompoop that's a cool word nincompoop
I probably say one of the things I say a
lot is y'all right I'm not sure that's a
known thing or a weekend thing or a
British thing but rolling the words you
are you all right into your right so
that laughs it's pretty British yeah
cockney rhyming slang I don't know any
apart from like apples and pears stairs
that's about the only thing I know
yeah I'm not Londoner I'm a northerner
we don't say things like that we don't
really use them
maybe I should make my new tack with
this like Wiccan slang or we can slang
words see if everyone can do that that's
hardened my favorite sweet oh I love
pear drops a little overtakes of pear
drops
oh my gosh favorite sweet Uncle Joe's
mint balls how do you ever have an
inclusion isn't bulb please comment
below if you've had one they are made in
Wigan they are like a little round black
mints and they're just the nicest takes
a mini levitate or maybe they come on a
little wrapper and a little bag you've
got to go and get some of you see any
get some you'll enjoy them a lot what
would you have public hold the Queen Vic
obviously number one British person
Queenie the Queen quit school Queens
pretty cool when she felt a bomb those
girls and she saw that selfie those
girls took over she liked photo bombed
in the background smiley face stuff oh
I'm warmed my heart in a different shop
or restaurant go with like Topshop
Selfridges
a lot of Selfridges virgin selfie she's
has everything else in it so God really
say Selfridges just because it is super
British it's awesome and it sells
everything you could ever need ever so
yeah Selfridges a restaurant one of my
favorite restaurants I've noticed if
necessary British cooks an Italian
restaurant but it's in Britain so it's a
chain called chroma Italian chain and
they do the nicest cellars and nights
the nicest food it's super cheap you
ever go to Manchester find Cromer
because it's so tasty I think this we've
got some other place as well so I say
that's what my favourites
I also live right near a restaurant
called dough that makes pizza again it's
Italian but it's like Italian food
that's great it's also restaurant the
non-core are called the Northern Quarter
restaurant that's really British food
that's amazing
but otherwise just I love nothing more
than when I'm out with a family trip and
we stopped off at Paul's ever feel like
a country lane we found it beautiful
like old man poor thing go there and get
pub food like pate like onion soup
cheese on it or a big roast dinner
nothing better than that like that is so
British and I love it like when I was in
America last year first ten weeks I was
craving pate abs craving roast beef I
was craving roast dinner that my mom
made I was just hoping for like lemon
meringue pie and like really
quintessentially English things and me
realize I do like Britain a lot more
than I give it credit for so yeah what
British song pops into your head
London : it's not by the crush we are
the champions it was Queen English I was
Queen American my skills wanna be that
was a good song as man
oh good for those times when I was like
nine eight nine and Spice Girls just
ruled the world they ruled my world they
were cool they were so good Marmite . no
I think I mentioned this in my 50 facts
about me I hate my my it smells horrible
it smells and tastes horrible saying
that though I did the same thing the
peanut butter are the same thing about
peanut butter and I'll know peanut
butter don't like it and then now I am
addicted to it same with olives addicted
acardo's addicted so you never know any
new or so if I give my might bit more of
a go we'd rather try around we could be
friends and that's it that is it this
wolf attack made up by the beautiful
Sami from the Beauty crush cool taxon I
just want to do I mean how British do
you think I am I'd probably say I'm not
only British especially those people
I've done this and they've been like
yeah like 20 cups of tea a day with 55
sugars in them it kind of milk not all
those people I much rather go for the
hot chocolate and the tasty thing I just
want to give a massive thank you to
everyone who came said hello to me and
the girls it's summer in the city this
weekend that's just gone it was so nice
