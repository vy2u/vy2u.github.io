might want to see if I could get up too
so it's seen at the Grove hotel some of
you may know about it's like this huge
mansion in Northland and it's filled
with like trees and a golf course around
it such a stunner and just got to my
hotel room and I thought you might want
to see it because it's absolutely
amazing
oh my goodness not even tell you how
much space is in here as a full-size
sofa
I'm look how beautiful that's oh my
goodness is absolutely beautiful view
the ball court and outside space and a
bench that is just a room with you and
they've even left some what are
macaroons have a lovely stay at the
Grand Hotel oh my goodness this is like
the most luxurious hotel I have ever
ever seen yeah by the way I never sent
off the scarf apparently but by the way
I'm wearing my brand new whistles dress
that I bought I've got about new stuff
about trying whistles and totally fell
for it I know it's completely plain
black dress but I just really wanted
somewhere with my boots and happy tail
every statement so when I refreshed up
now
and then head down for dinner just back
to the room now or just have some eating
and glean them some meetings so you just
did that
and then I'm back now and I'm going to
take off on a cup and then completely
redo it so far film a little bit ever
get ready with me alongside this video

Vichy period thermal I want to prove
makeup remover so oh my god it's just
the only thing that gets off what pretty
makeup for me so yes sir

exfoliating wash because it's so good
and it's got little balls in it and it
really gets all you make a path for me
very well I'll take I'm just finished
doing my hair with my the Whitney Marie
hair tool the large barrel this is my
favorite tool now so I'm just finished
doing that my battery died on my camera
so I had to leave it to charge but I did
that what back to make her I also had my
eye I said you see I read my eyes are
I've really sensitive eyes and at the
moment they're just not playing ball and
then so I'm scared about putting in the
eye makeup on before they settle down
because last time as a pie all of my eye
makeup was F

not sure what ready I am ready help you
focus dress this is from a qaq I am

big side yeah so I should have maybe got
