I am so excited first of all to say that
I am going to working with Trek America
soon I don't know if any of you saw my
2013 favorites and I mentioned about my
trip that I did to track with Trek
America to America over summer I mean
how amazing it was well anyway they've
decided to work with me on a big
campaign Atlas off running soon it's
going to start in February so if you're
quite interesting Trek America and maybe
winning the trip a trek America trip and
keep your eyes on my blog so that's in
the fro calm and the blower's
information they're really really suit
so I thought I'd let you all know loads
of people are going to film any TMI tags
and I've been watching so many of them
it's just such a good way of getting to
know the youtuber or the blogger so I
thought maybe I should give a go and
then Leon Leon Lynn Walker on YouTube
should check her out she's gorgeous she
did the TMI tag which was probably one
the best ones I've seen and she tagged
me to do it so I thought right I need to
get this we go so let's go and
everything's on my phone by the way so
if I'm looking down at my phone I'm not
being antisocial okay so what are you
wearing fluffy blue knit long signet is
from boohoo and wearing this gorgeous
gold bracelet was really pretty little
soft purple gem in the center that's
from a brand called vintage styler I
leave all information below and I'm also
wearing these sort of high-waisted blue
floral sort of really comfy cozy kind of
pants and trousers was kind of cuffed
and calls which I have been wearing soft
and sweet just with something pair of
self high ankle boots and on my lips is
Mac night moths a little bit of Mac
cherry lip liner as well and then a
little tiny double of the Lime Crime
Velveteen suede berry lipstick so it's a
bit of an ombre
and and that's it have you ever been in
love yes twice and unfortunately one of
them I don't speak to anymore and
neither one I match the really good
friends but she's really good
have you ever had a terrible breakup yes
yes quite a few terrible breakups I
think I'm quite an indecisive person
especially recently so it's been a
number of breakups that haven't been the
best how tall are you I am 5 foot 7 how
much do you weigh quite personal
question and let's just say I'm size 6
so you can probably work it out any
tattoos I have five tattoos I have um
lyrics here which say every word
handwritten which is a gasser and some
song which I love and about my favorite
band and I have a feather tattoo on my
arm here I have a tattoo down the back
of my neck get my back that says you
live you learn and which is honest my
set lyric if you didn't know I have my
left foot and inside tattoo that says
arise which is a Flyleaf lyric and on my
right foot I have a little tiny heart
which symbolizes love I am also in the
planning of getting a really long tattoo
down one side and a dream catcher on my
thigh and a crown somewhere and also I
want all nine planets on me somewhere
and in a row with my arm or on my legs
and left so if you are in the pipeline
any piercings I only have ears pierced
I've got one on this side and two on
this side just because oth a once your
pairing no idea what this while until
the answer is up talking about it it's
one true pairing thing I I'm in the mind
frame the moment where there is a person
for every stage of your life
so so I might meet someone that I will
get to know for like five years I'll be
amazing for that five years but after
five years you realize that you stopped
growing apart and someone else
that's better for that stage your life
and you kind of have these stage of your
life that you can go through and get to
know new people I don't know I don't
really believe the sort of wand soulmate
for everyone I think this is like eight
billion people everyone so different and
this chat side you'll get on with about
thousand people amazingly so it's just
finding them so if you're the one for me
come along Everett show it's difficult
it's gonna be either Breaking Bad Game
of Thrones True Blood Made in Chelsea
favorite bands gasser anthem Google's a
melt a lot of cartel or Bombay Bicycle
Club sitting color I also love people
like Drake I love Miley Cyrus at the
moment I pretty much love every type of
music apart from indie I cannot stand
indie music something you miss at the
moment I miss cuddles that's really
really pathetic but I do I'd like a new
cuddler please I was a miss like student
life uni life it was just the best few
years ever and now sort of having to
grow up and go to work every day and
have responsibilities is quite
pressurizing and I wish I'd sort of
spent more time my uni years thinking
about how awesome it was it was just
amazing
favorite song probably have to be hand
written rather gasa anthem hence this
and also police say a song by Ray
LaMontagne called Jolene does the most
beautiful song and it reminds with some
of the best times in my life so Jolene
check out how old you are I am 24 not
that i lock it I realize that so relaxed
I encounter quality you look for in a
partner
mmmmmm have to be first of all
personality-wise we have to have a
really good personality so I need to be
funny
really we the kind really trustworthy
and and the sort of really finds you
special and my dough on you only sort of
looks wise I mean I'm always drawn to
someone's personality I've never and
gotten with someone just
their looks it's always been soft
personality-based so but I would ask and
say I'll say guys that toned up not
ridiculously cheap my gym still adds but
you know like someone who really looks
after the body that's great
and tall dark handsome favorite quote
you live you learn
probably I also really like the I think
it's Shakespeare quote of for evil to
prosper it only takes one good man to do
nothing think that's a quote something
along those lines and I think it's
really very I really like that
favorite actor Tom Hanks because far
skumps one my favorite films and he's
just amazing
Leonardo DiCaprio is always amazing
Steve Carell Ryan Gosling shine Tatum
sisters lots of people are fancy
favorite color turquoise aqua blue loud
music or soft loud I think that's not
really the right question should be loud
music although music or hard or soft
music loud and soft and bipolar I like
that a light loud music I like me to be
loud and more than I do like it to be
low and quiet but I also really like
soft music I mean now together since
like classical or jazz or blues at the
same time I also live listen to heavy
rock a bit of metal pop punk so straight
question where do you go when you're sad
use it to a cafe to get a hot chocolate
pancakes or something else and the bath
and just go and sit the bath cry look at
the walls or film or just generally in
bed how longs it take for you to shower
about five minutes if I'm washing my
hair for about 15 how long does it take
you to get ready in the morning takes me
about 25 minutes I don't really do
anything in my hair I just brush it
stick a bit of makeup on put some
clothes
and it takes me longer than that to get
from the time I wake up the time I leave
the house is about an hour and a half
because I'm procrastinating too much but
actually getting ready about half an
hour ever been in a physical fight no
now I haven't I would lose so badly I
have no muscle on my arms turn on would
be a really good body so like you can
tell they work out and got abs and arms
and they're just kind of look after
themselves as well as just being really
chatty and just getting on really well
with me that's biggest turn-on usually I
turn off someone who's obsessed with the
gym like obsessed with it I always
wanted to go always obsessed without
showing it on the muscles I mean yeah I
know I like guys and muscles but it's in
that kind of modest way of I just want
to look after myself and keep fit it's
not in there I'm just doing this to poor
girls because I think that my body is
amazing and therefore doing this every
time of the day that is annoying the
reason I joined YouTube
I had just such a started blogging I
watched a lot of YouTube videos it
allows a lot of my favorite bloggers
whereas youtubers thought was a really
good way to kind of get your kind of
message across better about certain
things and kind of give more of an idea
of your personality way to people
because you share a lot more of your
manners and the way you speak and stuff
on camera so I thought I'd give it a go
and I really enjoyed it
carried on and fears the fear of sharks
like massive fear so much so that
sometimes gets getting swimming pools
fulfilling have a fear of broken glass
not such an extent but and I get really
scared by broken glass and it being on
the floor and nearly last thing that
made you cry whew the other day I cried
at video on wimp calm you don't watch
what calm you really should it's so good
they put out like seven video today I'm
on Facebook as well but on their actual
site and they're all that really awesome
videos you probably won't ever
find but the kind of really are either
uplifting or really cute of like dogs
and stuff and they always stop throw-in
like the curveball emotional one about
like some old people or things like that
so that was probably what made me cry
last time you said you loved someone
well I just got off the phone with my
dad and I said I love you and then 10
minutes before that I was on the phone
to my mom and said I loved Paris basa
a meaning behind your youtube name in
the fro is same as my blog name in the
fro it came from okay it's a song by
Alanis Morissette called I'm in the
front row with popcorn which is what I
named my tumblr about four years ago
when I first started blogging so that
was in the front row with popcorn so
when I made my fashion blog I wanted to
kind of use the same name so I had have
linked them together but I thought I'm
in the front row with popcorn would be
too long and a little bit kind of
ambiguous so I thought what about I'm in
the front row that got changed to in the
front row and then I was right well most
people call well in fashion some people
call the front row the fro so it became
in the fro and that was that last book
you read so the last book I read was bad
planning up thinking Matt and survivor
at Chuck panics my favorite author and
pretty much only read things by him the
book you're currently reading I'm not
really reading it's such it's not really
reading book but I am dabbling with the
Emily Schumann cupcakes and Kashmir book
guys it's just sort of light reading
when I don't want to really took Planet
novel and it's a kind of style book a
bit of lifestyle but interiors a bit of
cooking home where and it's a bit of
fashion there so it's really really good
books kind of blogging and things like
that the last show you want I watched
girl season 1 episode 3 last night which
was so so good and I think later on I
probably watch episode 2 the last person

the person you last texted I texted my
best friend stuff and now I hailstone
what what is this can you hear that
try and carry on say hello
favorite food chicken liver pate without
doubt place you want to visit I want to

Vietnam I Scandinavia if you are in
Scandinavia yes place you were
downstairs get in the mail kill
otherwise at work do you have a crush if
Ryan Gosling counts and yes otherwise
actually no yeah maybe a little one how
do you kiss someone I think it's about a
month ago
I've actually been too busy to kiss
people that's pretty lame last time you
were insulted it was probably on YouTube
or Instagram or oh I know and it will be
the other day in my PhD driver the
examiner said some things that were just
a bit like and I was insulted favorite
flavor of sweet strawberry strawberry
kind of flavors so sort of big
strawberry things my favorite sweet

instruments do you play I used to be
able to play the flute and I probably
will play it and I used to play the
piano or keyboard and I can also play
the guitar
favorite piece of jewelry my favorite
piece of jewelry is probably a Tiffany
ring that a number of my friends bought
me and my birthday for my 21st birthday
last sport you played sure the last part
I played was probably basketball when I
was in America and we had court near
that big in the campground we all
stopped played and it's got a few girls

favorite sport so I'm glad I can say
that the last song he sang last song is
sang was a day to remember song from the
new album

line
so it's probably when I used to wear my
black milk galaxy leggings all the time
people you said they say things like and

the moon and back or there's so many
different ridiculous ones and so
probably one of those have I ever used

some friends and Saturday we went out at
Manchester an amazing night who should
