this time relates to hair it's been
around 9 months since I did a video
related to hair styles and styling my
hair so I'm sorry it's been so long but
I thought it's finally time I did
something hair related so in this video
I'm going to show you 3 of my favorite
types of hairstyles to do whether it's
summer whether it's when you're on
holiday just general hair cells I really
really enjoy doing for this video I'm
collaborating with batiste who have
brought out a new range of styling
products my heat and shine sprays - hair
sprays - frizz tamers so I'm going to be
playing around with all of those and
kind of creating these hairstyles using
all of these styling products so I'm
pretty excited to get started so let's
just get into it so the first hairstyle
this is gonna be my up ponytail do that
I generally do if I'm go to the gym or
I'm just going out and I want to get my
hair off my face I think it looks super
cute especially now I've got this white
hair really really loving it in the
moment
so to give my hair a little bit more
bounce and to get it a bit more volume
eyes at the roots I'm gonna start off
with the oomph my locs XXL volume spray
from the taste and love the packaging of
this as well how beautiful is a
packaging it is sort of everyday I just
sort of go in quite quickly with this
kind of little bit the hair kind of
taking a hair midway up spring it into
the roots move around the sides a little
less thick and full so a bit of volume
spray goes a long way really with this
my hair do it really good scription
up just has loads of volume and texture
just into these sections so no kind of
push it through with my hands push it
all back use my hands underneath the
nape of the neck to pull the hair up and
then put really quite high
the head that spreadeth give me loads of
volume now at these roots we're not
going to go really flats which is fab so
just got a mirror my wardrobe mirror to
help me out here let's put it up really
high and then I'm a hair now it's a lot
thicker because of the spray so I really
need to tie it in twice and then I'll
just need to pull it on the top of my
head like so you can really kind of play
around with it and manipulate where
about your hair but the good thing about
this is that there's loads of volume now
in those roots so not flat and this
looks really cute now at this point all
depends what kind of phony tell you on
some days I want my puddin tail to be
super sleek and really really straight
Sunday so I find I put my hair up and
all this part my ponytail usually this
is about three days after it's been
washed and meeting its and neither wash
and my hair goes a little bit frizzy
unfortunately that's the case then just
a bit the smooth it frizz tamer with a
perfect just to nice spray through the
lengths and just keep all the hair
really soft and smooth down and that's
not going to frizz up as much that and
you've got a really sleek Pony or on the
alternative side if you want to go
something a bit more kind of volume and
texture as' then at the texturizing
spray is the one to go for so with this
you can just spray it up I can go
straight up into that
if you want as well you can also kind of
backcomb a bit at the roots or and that
gives you really messy really cool kind
of ponytail I really this kind of
ponytail it just just says I've got out
of bed but I look awesome kind of look
and then of course I won't need those
but hairspray keep in place for the day
and they hold me hairspray I absolutely
love these massive bottles of hairspray
make sure that you put a little bit onto
the bubble section so that is hair found
number one because I put my blinds down
because it's playing tricks with my
camera okay so hairstyle number two
who's gonna be my curly look so now and
again if I'm going to events or if I
just really want to kind of pump up my
look for the day I will kill my hair so
any kill you have is perfect so to start
off with you need to protect your hair
from the heat we gonna put in on it so
this is the heat and shine spray if you
want you can spray it all over your hair
before you start I generally prefer when
I'm curling my hair to split my hair
first just put that into two sections
like that and then this heat and shine
spray for heat protection up to 230
degrees which is pretty awesome so for
this I would just spray into the hair
sections but I'm about to put the heat
on - smells really nice
excuse the lead right from my face there
aren't as many plugs in this room to
help me with this
these kill have got a hold so well as
well cuz I've got the heat and shine
spray going through them I've got the
texturizing spray and it will all help
to really hold those kills in big time
actually
okay halfway done this takes so long
okay so I'm going to take this off and
spray it up with that heat and shine
spray this totally covered
best piece run behind with the wand
wrapping it round flaps and holding it
and we're done okay so my usual honey
after do these curls I'm gonna brush
them out because otherwise they look
crazy this is how that looks
I'm gonna put a bit more of the XXL
volume spray through this of course if I
haven't already done it before then
Seussical a bit doing so just a bit
volume strange into the root um I'm
really sorry if I'm looking here our
time so I'm using that as my mirror X I
don't have any of the mirror here you
are my mirror right now I'm also gonna
put a bit of the smooth and frizz tamer
through the ends just keep them smooth
and curly what I don't want that for
it's nice and smooth and defined and of
course some of me hold my hair spray to
finish and we done the third and final
hairstyle is going to beat my curly but
half up half down look between kind of
my eyebrows when the eyebrows end of the
middle kind of go up run my hands up and
take a chunk off the very top of my head
right here then about halfway up the
scalp I'll cut through the middle of it
cuz I don't want to take up all that
hair in the back see almost letting all
that hair at the back go down it's
normal but you have this bit right yep
now this point you can put a little bit
of the XXL volume spray into the back of
this
just give it some rootless and some
volume and I'll use this is just a
little clear plastic hair tie if you
have one tie that up quite half so super
easy and then pull it in half and took
down I'm gonna pull out a little bit the
front give that extra volume in there of
course
finish it off with some hairspray and
that is it which was your favorite let
