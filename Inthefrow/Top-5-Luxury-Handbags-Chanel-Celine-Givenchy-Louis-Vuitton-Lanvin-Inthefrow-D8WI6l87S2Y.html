is going to be a more kind of
accessories fashion style video I'm
going to talk you through my top 5
favorite bags quite often I'll get asked
about my handbag collection and to show
you all of the handbags that I have but
I thought that I didn't look down to my
top 5 and to show you through all of
those show you which of my favorites why
I love them why I picked them up in the
first place I feel I need to say here as
well but if you don't really like
handbag collection videos or you don't
want to watch anything like this isn't
your kind of video then there's no real
point you watching it so my plan is to
click off rather than leaving hateful or
negative comments about handbags or any
of that kind of things so yeah I'm sorry
if it's not your kind of video but
there's a lot of people that requested
Bay so yeah let's get into the video
also if anyone who likes to make that
I'm wearing Alba doing a full blog post
on this whole look and what I think are
the makeups it's all brand new so look
out on in the fro calm really really
seeing it'll be on there very soon and
then start off with the chiffon she had
to go in a bag mainly because this is
such a sought-after bag it is highly
loved it's been out for a couple of
years now like I said in the past I did
buy this in a baby pink once and baby
pink went blue in the rain which I don't
know fixes my bag and it was a fluke
off chance or if that's all the pink
ones but I went back and I bought the
smaller versions this is a small and to
go in a handbag in the navy blue or deep
blue tube in a website you go on I want
to this bag because it was extremely
sturdy very robust I know so many of you
love the fact I say robust more than any
other word in the dictionary but this
literally robot is what describes this
bag seriously a zip is so heavy-duty
it's super thick it even the small
version holds so much in there this is
like my big bag if I'm going out
shopping or go to meetings I know would
have to have like part of paper hair or
anything like that or an umbrella
I'll often take this back so know that
holds everything sturdy strap great
handles on it and it's a really good
size kind of sit in the crook of your
arm I think it's a great investment
piece for anyone who's looking to get
their first handbag wants something
that's strong isn't that flimsy the
color is going to hold really well so
even if you get f it on it's not going
to be too noticeable
also I have this in the texted the
textured grain leather generally I would
always recommend sticking to the grain
leather if you have nails or anything
that could Nick the leather it's going
to scratch so just be careful of that if
you're buying a very first handbag I
wouldn't recommend getting smooth
leather bag definitely get this kind of
leather I bought this about six months
ago I bought it with some vouchers for a
store that I had yeah so that's Jeff
late one of my top five I will leave a
link down below for the under going out
as well as the other four bags in this
video so if you like them you can go
have a little look look at the prices
look at the textures materials and all
that yes and for anyone as well it's
wondering where my my bag and shoe
cabinet is from that I got it's just
from Ikea okay
next bag on the list is a new on to my
collection which you see lanthorn
GG bag Lygia bar she was silver hardware
this is golden hardware which I don't
often go for but I really love the fact
it's kind of like blush nude with the
gold strap and the gold hardware I
thought it was rather pretty you open it
it just twists and they both twist
together this comes off and inside it
has three compartments it's actually got
quite a bit space for example I can put
my Olympus camera in here sideways you
get healthy pancake lens on it but your
phone you can fit cars an umbrella
probably like it just fit quite a
considerable amount for a smaller bag
now this is a smoother leather I think
because a type of leather isn't shiny
patent
smooth leather it is a bit smoother at
the same time this isn't my very first
bag so I thought I'd go for it so with
the strap as well so you can either wear
the strap long and then the gold train
goes on the top or you can pull the blue
snaps together and you can wear it as a
shorter bag as well which is quite sweet
so there's a couple of ways to wear it
and quite often I'll also kind of carry
it in my hand it's a bit of a kind of
little clutch style so I bought this bag
couple weeks ago from far fetch and
they've kindly give me some vouchers so
again I got this at discounted next up
is the Louboutin twist back I am so
obsessed with the current loom
Tom ranges like the Capucine bag it's
currently on my loss list it's so
beautiful I really did this I really
wanted something a small black bag with
silver hardware that could fit small
little amounts of products inside it
because at the moment and really loving
the whole over-the-shoulder trend with
like a big coat so I just been wearing
like big coats with this - slung over my
shoulder just it's right across you
really safe and secure but this is the
LB twist it has a really cool shape to
it this very triangular kind of style I
couldn't tell you what this material is
I'm not snot shorb it's almost looks a
little bit like a laminated leather so
again it's not very easy to scratch
which is perfect it opens like this and
you're open like that which is quite
sweet this is quite a small bag that
I'll be honest because of the structure
of this bag these sections here are
stuck in place you've got to get
something in here for example my iPhone
6s plus doesn't quite fit I mean it may
be with a book oh yeah just about fits
and that's with this loom you light on
it which Laurie I'll get gave me how
cool is this little selfie line Lois hmm
so it just about fits inside with that
on so that might give you a bit of an
idea it just kind of size of this but
again I find it fits my phone a couple
of lipsticks cards keys and there we go
you look really fit umbrella couple if
it umbrella right now with a few things
on top but otherwise I really love this
up and take it out all the time I love
the fact that it's this obviously silver
hardware really cool alternative chain
strap and a large leather hand alright
the very top source if you've got it
over your shoulder it's a bit more
comfortable than the silver chain strap
and I picked this up from vest year
which is an online reselling platform so
it's where people who have kind of
luxury pieces can resell them and
recycle which is great so that's why I
always use if I'm looking for bags are
up for sale that are already used so I
got this from there again with a
discount of some vouchers to buy
products from this
next oh is this one which I still have
in a little pouch because this is my
newest one this is the Chanel wallet on
a chain who is literally almost the size
of a large purse wallet on a beautiful
silver hardware chain with blue leather
wrap through the middle so it's very
Chanel in a style but with blue and
silver as well and the chain is the same
all the way around and it goes into the
wallet on shade on walk as people like
to call it the WSC this one is in the
boys style so has a boy lock fastening
style which obviously doesn't open this
way like the boy does it instead is a
cute little popper I like the fact that
looks like a small miniature boy it's in
the herringbone pattern so you can get
it in the iconic and more classic Chanel
quilted patterning but I really love the
fact this is herringbone it's just a
little bit more unusual I mean the
colors so may navy blue is kind of my
thing okay I'm wearing a blue now a new
blue out a door and again and really
loving the smaller wallet style bags
select the Louboutin that showed you
absolutely adore schnell and whenever I
go in there everything is so beautiful
but I've never been absolutely smitten
with a bag enough to want to buy one I
saw this from across the room I destroy
it over to it and fell completely in
love with it and thoughts exactly what
I've been looking for my kind of color
it's not going to scratch to a user
because the patterning it's not going to
show up quite as easily as if it was
completely smooth and slightly in fact
I've still left eye patches left the
card sections in there I'm not even
taking those out yet but this is only
very quite small but I test it out I can
fit to my iPhone in here plus a lipstick
a lip liner my cards and a key so for
any kind of date nights and going on or
tenders the nights out a little bit more
class ooh and I'm not going to be
getting the drink spilled all over it
it's kind of perfect going to take all
the bumps and all the rubbish that I
don't really need in my bag which you
often just light all up with this
interesting case but it's just like the
very bare minimum I could take a comb in
there as well I'm sure but for me I
bought this bag as well for more
traveling because as you might know I do
got a lot of traveling trips and
I've got so many coming up I can't even
tell you so prepared for lots of travel
blocks that's all I'm saying
if so in travels coming up I thought
this would be perfect little travel
companion so I'd like to wear this
crossbody so I don't have to take it off
entire time in the airport and I can fit
my passport in it I can fit any other
documentation I can fit my phone I can
set key and you know just a kind of the
very bare minimum so when it comes to
the times when you have to go through
checkouts and security and all that you
can just have my passport inside it
super safe is a cure so I have to go
rooting through a big about trying to
find dollar essentials for every single
checkpoint therefore I thought it'd be
really really handy in a big treat but I
am so in love with this in complete
honesty I almost wish that this video
was a 6 top favorites because I can't
decide between the Chloe drew all the
Saline thinking about to go for sleep
sorry Chloe
I'm going to go for Slingbox bag for a
couple of reasons
mainly because this is one of the
biggest hand by purchases that I made
last year I'd had a really really busy
year worked extremely hard and this was
a huge treat to myself because I had
loved it for years and I'd been putting
away money for it
to pick it up and finally I managed to
go in and buy it
textured black leather again I didn't
want to go for smooth when you're buying
a bag that's this price so I was waiting
awaiting waking and fun it came and
stopped so glad that I did because it's
definitely one of my favorite slices is
my number one bag just because it's kind
of quite special to me and it kind of
marks a very exciting and hardworking
year and it's just a big big treat to
myself to opens that list little clasp
it just says you can't really see but
it's a saline here on this inside bit
where that passes over I just assess
being Paris about to have everything in
here cuz I use is yesterday but it
actually has quite a good size to it a
big large compartment this is slightly
small compartment and at the back a
zipped compartment so you again capaz
box and their phones documentation money
and this little bit as well it have two
sections for my phone's oregon card so
after a cute castanet as well traps
leather it goes
through the inside this part of the back
then up into the strap the strap is not
too long but I like it on this length
because again it kind of just sits over
me crossbody and sits just on my kind of
hip bone so again I know it's extremely
safe and secure and I'm not going to
lose it after carrying heavy bags heavy
large bags for so long I decided I
really need to start taking less out
with me and these have been ensuring
that I only take the absolute essentials
I'm no longer filling it with everything
and then weighing myself down and then
having really about shoulders from it so
these have really been helping so yes I
might have quite a lot of small bags but
it's for me so I'm really it's just
because I want to downsize this is the
last one what else can I tell you about
this bag you can find us now in most
saline concessions for Saline you have
to go into the boutiques you can't buy
online unless you would like to look on
a reselling website so what I'll do is I
will leave some links down below of
where you could find some of these
secondhand which are in brilliant
condition they're just quite a lot less
money which is good so leave some links
down below and the same to the Chanel
back as well something I'm just going to
end it there really this is my top 5 so
I'll leave all links down below for all
the bags if you did like any of them and
you're thinking about some of those
yourself go and have a look look at more
of the information prices and colors to
come in on different textures and
fabrics if you would also like to see
more pictures of me wearing these bags
then feel free to go onto my blog in the
fro comm again I'll leave a link down
below and just type in the name of the
bag and it will come up with so many
choices of me wearing all the different
bags and different styles and it might
give you more of an idea of how you
might be able to wear them as well
that's it for now guys I think I'm going
to do a few more this kind of video
because I'm really quite enjoyed putting
it together I think I might do top 5
shoes maybe maybe top 5 jackets or top 5
I don't know anything I mean just leave
me some ideas down below if there's
anything you'd really like to see if you
like the video then please go give it
