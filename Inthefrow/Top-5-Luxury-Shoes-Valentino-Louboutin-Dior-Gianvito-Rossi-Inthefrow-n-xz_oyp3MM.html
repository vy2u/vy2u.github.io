this video is following a pretty partial
video that I did a couple of weeks ago
maybe months ago and it was my top 5
favorite luxury handbags so many who had
requested to see my whole handbag
collection but I thought I'd Whittle it
down to my top 5 just keep it sort of
short concise and tell you all about
what I really really loved so then I
thought well why don't I do it for my
favorite shoes so this is going to be my
top 5 favorite luxury designer shoes
this will be in any order by the way
it's just my top 5 I might try and
mention which ones brought my favorite
as we got a lot but anyway so gonna
start off with the Valentino rock stud
these are in the powder nude powder
shade they are a pair of heels that I
didn't realize I would get so much wear
out of until I got them they're kind of
a very very classic shoe and for a while
I sort of thought well are they done now
do I really need a pair like I've been a
bit out fashion but they kind of they're
still there season after season and
they're so classic to Valentino now I
feel like the quality to be here for a
long time and I thought why not just
invest get pair have them in my wardrobe
for any time I need them and I've found
them to be my most worn shoot with the
last few months in the shade that go
with everything they are unbelievably
comfortable you talking to a sort of
four inch heel beautiful pointed toe and
all the different straps and they just
look so flattering and quite sexy on the
feet without being too over-the-top but
also super classic sophisticated yeah
I'm a big big fan next up I really have
to mention these because these were a
purchase I thought off for quite a while
and I kept seeing these boots here there
and everywhere I just felt more and more
in love with them and they are the Dior
true non boot they're very different
very unique they have a number of
difference of jacquard fabrics in the
sort of bronze gold the navy black and
also the pink so it's a very unique shoe
very kind of eclectic mix of styles so
the pointed toe absolutely adore they
have the lacing to things
it and zip up the back as well these are
still available I'm sure and although
officer they're very kind of runway
seasonal I still feel like new
incredible pair of boots are carrying on
wearing
next up have to be the ease from much
Yaffe to Rossi and I must have mentioned
it a few times now these are not a very
pricey shoe like these are nearly a
thousand pounds these shoes I had a gift
card to use on Louise Via Roma and this
is what I picked up with them because I
have been eyeing these up and they're
dissing saying they're incredible but
absolutely beautiful the fabric in this
suede turquoise suede is stunning and
cutout work detail I really draw up and
it looks so flattering on so
complimentary to the style of your leg
they're very kind of elongating
extremely comfortable you are someone
that wants to invest in your first pair
of designer shoes please look no further
lunch LV Taurasi because you will
literally love them so comfortable
they're not overly I mean this is a
highest shoe but the fact that it's all
around the ankle you're encased inside
it means it's much more comfortable and
you don't feel like you're gonna fall
out as much so you feel more secure I
couldn't recommend them more I love them
the next pair are a pair of very beaten
up and now muddy jean beatty Rossi's
like I said I'm a bit upset so jumpy to
Rossi and these are the first pairing of
the ball and ever since I have worn them
to death and I wore them in Dallas
recently so they're now covered in mud
which is not great so I need to get
these an incredible cleanup these shoes
are the perfect complement to any outfit
in the white in the nude we go with
every single shade you could possibly
want to pair them with they're
incredibly comfortable they need to call
the Calabria courts and have this plexi
material here your feet just feel really
comfortable in them and it's again put
about a three and a half four inch heel
if you're into your heels it's not too
much to walk in for anyone that doesn't
like heels of course it's a bit more
however it is really comfortable the
shoe and if you get it in the right size
it will stay on your feet I almost feel
like these become part of my legs and
I'm walking them actually I could walk
four so far in these I know I've done so
many days of Fashion Week's in them
recommend them enough by the way for in
terms of sizing charlie recommend buying
them in your usual shoe size like if you
know my channel well you'll have seen
quite a lot these shoes before but I
just want to kind of round them up into
saying these are my top five these once
I would highly recommend and the very
last ones again you'll have seen many
many times I've had these since I
started my blog and they are the
Louboutin pig al pump extremely classic
it's you know sophisticated a kind of
shoe again gives you everything so a bit
like very similar almost in style to the
shibito apart from that house kind of
the white tip to it but I just love the
pointy toe I'm into the pointy toe and I
remember I bought these before I even
had the blog so it was a nice website
the blog and actually got much more into
showing people my fashion and I could
show them off which Mart and they are
beautiful the very classic I'm pretty
sure you can still get them if not once
very very similar
bear in mind Louboutins are most
probably the most uncomfortable heels to
wear I'll be honest I also have this
pair of Louboutins which are in
incredible red and they're just the most
stunning shoes when we look at that heel
they're the most uncomfortable shoes
I've ever worn in my entire life I can
literally do like a date night sat down
in these and have to rip them off my
feet afterwards but things aren't quite
as bad but I must admit this still very
uncomfortable you can only do a few
hours in these our met if you're a heals
lover you'll know usually we buy shoes
and sometimes are not all that
comfortable but we have to put up with
it sometimes that's just the way it
works but these are wonderful shoes and
I had to put my top 5 because suggest it
were my first designer purchase really
and they did go with everything so those
are my top 5 so you got some classics
and now you've got a couple of seasonal
pieces that are a bit more out there but
these are the ones right now I'm
absolutely in love with the ones I reach
for the most
so once I want to style up the most so
I'll leave all links down below of where
you pretend to get them the do your
boots you can only get in store they
don't really sell online you just need
to visit a boutique or maybe going to
Selfridges or Harrods or somewhere to
find those otherwise I'll leave all
links for the other four down below for
you guys I would also say for every
single of these shoes they all fit true
to size as well so I always get my usual
shoe size and every single
them I forgot to say that and that's it
for this video I wanted to keep it short
and sweet just sort of round at my top
five really really hope you enjoyed it
