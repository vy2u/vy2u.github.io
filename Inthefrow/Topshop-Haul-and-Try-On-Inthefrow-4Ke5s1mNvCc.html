different setting I am in Paris I'm at
the hotel Molitor and I'm here with
Clarence for a few days and I really
really wanted to film this video so I've
actually brought with me everything for
this video just so I can film it for you
I went shopping on the weekend with some
of my best friends who went to Topshop
and recently I've been in a bit of a
fashion rot it's middle of the year it's
not quite cold it's not quite warm I'm
not too sure how I'm feeling when it
comes to fashion so I went into Topshop
and I said to my best friend look let's
go to Topshop
I really want to buy some new things I'm
gonna spice up my wardrobe again come
and help me
so wouldn't have a look and I've
actually come away with quite a lot of
things but really good things I think so
I really wanted to show you by the way
this bomber jacket isn't from Topshop I
will leave a link down below to where I
get it from this will be featured very
soon in another hole but it just hasn't
happened yet but I wanted to wear it
anyway so I'll leave a link down below
Fisk's I know so many of you have been
going on about it off my snapchat I've
been wearing it non-stop
so yeah links down below for this if you
like it yeah I might as well just get
right into it this is a huge top shop
haul so first up a pair of khaki Jaime
jeans you can't go wrong with Chop Shop
jeans I don't think I know that my
friend struggled the sizes in there but
I've always I don't know why I've always
managed it just they seemed to fit me
quite well so I am sort of a size 6 and
I usually fit in the 25 of the 26 es or
26 and we're really super tight actually
and I also went for the leg 30 so it'd
be even shorter cuz I wanted these to be
like an ankle grazer but they're a great
color of carking they're a wonderful
length like I said great with heels but
they're still not too short they can
still put a high pair of boots with them
but I thought these would look super
cute with some sandals or I said
something nice to letõs what date
nights more like when you dress up jeans
that kind of look I'm all about that
look right now and for you guys I will
try these on with something
I'm gonna go for this I really like the
look of this you know what I haven't
even tried this on yet though
also these were 40 pounds so this top is
36 pounds but it's a little bit more
sort of ornate embroidered embellished
exciting's and the usual sort of basics
and Topshop and it reminds a little bit
of a top I had last summer but I really
really loved it but this is a little bit
more lightweight beautiful lacy design
this sort of crochet almost like
broderie anglaise here to the top of the
bust and also around the collar line I
mean how pretty I thought it was really
pretty I've got it in the UK six I hope
it fits it looks like it will but also
this lace edging is very very beautiful
so I will try those on together okay now
this I love I knew I'd love this top
it's so pretty isn't it which it's like
cut out it has a little bit more kind of
two-tone and colors got the skin and
you've got the white you've got these
beautiful lacy sections it's kind of
falls below where the top ends it's
really pretty is what looks like on the
back ties at the back I've been looking
for so many more tops like this recently
the can tops you can throw on if you're
going for like a girl day going for date
with your boyfriend Lyria half if you're
going even for like a cinema date with a
pair of white jeans and like converse
but to see you feel a bit more put
together it's like a really easy top so
I'm really really happy with it I love
this to bits and this is it with the
khaki trousers which are quite sweet fit
really lovely and I love the ankle
greater length so it's like a little bit
soft sexier when you pair them with a
pair of heels and fit nice - mm-hmm okay
this piece I am so excited about I think
a lot of you are going to love this
dress this I saw and was immediately
like Hello self-portrait Topshop are
knocking on your door so this is
extremely self-portrait inspired like
majorly
but how pretty this is 95 pounds
same kind of dress from self-portrait
would be round about 285 to 350 this is
a MIDI this is almost a cream not quite
lemon but it's more of a creamy shade
pastel blue black laced and very bottom
which goes up again into black and blue
lace and cream and it has a black belt
into the center
isn't it pretty though I literally was
like I have to get it it's more
affordable obviously it than
self-portrait but it's the Top Shot
finish and I thought it'd be super cute
and I thought so many of you guys would
love it outside I have a bit team isn't
that lovely
so I'll try that on for you with some
heels honestly how beautiful is this
dress literally since I saw girls like
that has self portrait written all over
it but much more affordable version very
similar style very classy very
sophisticated kind of thing you can wear
to events or special occasions
again I just put it with the same heel
so to show you kind of how I would wear
it but I mean you could wear it with a
little flats if you wanted to of the
cutout work on the back the fabric is
very flattering because it kind of hugs
you without being too tight or too much
but I just think the colors and the
stylist is so pretty
let me know what you think of this dress
down below in the comments I cannot wait
to hear what you guys think about it for
some basics and I got two bodies that I
really really liked I have however
bought this one in a petite by accident
I haven't even tried this on yet it does
look like it might fit me though but
this isn't the white it's kind of high
neck and goes around into these two
little straps that cross the bar at the
back and I'm wearing the same on here in
black but you know me I love my bodies
and I usually go for the sort of high
neck turtleneck cell bodies can't quite
wear those right now it is a bit too hot
for those so instead of thought let's
get some more bodies but strappy so
that's what I went for these two and
these are sixteen pounds each so much
more affordable can wear them with so
many more things the black ones
especially I love them wearing it quite
a bit actually
I wore it to Paris on the way here want
it today it's just really comfortable
and I really like the ribbed effects
aren't really see through it just fits
really nicely it's really comfortable so
16-pound and now I'm going to wear this
so much so I will try on the white and
the black for you and I'll try them on
with these trousers are wearing I can't
really show you them because I'm wearing
them this is really nice these are let's
move you they're a deep navy blue like a
jogger and got this cool like silky
satin down very sandal like the very
kind of sports looks cool chilled by
just go down to the very bottom like
that a little kind of very slowly I
really really like them a lot got
anything really like this quite sports
look and I thought with a pair of heels
I'll just look really chilled and really
cool so what I'll do is I will show you
from afar this body with the pants and
also with the white you can see what you
think okay so the black body with the
navy trousers paired it with my Shelley
to Rossi's as usual but just to show you
how you can wear this with a more kind
of sophisticated style so while these
are quite sports looks and quite kind of
baggy gnarly baggy but they're not
fitted so it just gives you a bit more
shape a bit looser but I just really
love the way you can style them up with
a pair of heels and they're quite cool
yeah it fit really nice and this is the
body quite sweet at the back just quite
sophisticated I like the fact as well
and it does hide your bra so you've not
got your brown but a lovely high neck on
this yeah and just to show you that
whole outfit altogether that's because
I'm totally digging it right now this is
the outfit with a jacket I realize this
isn't Topshop guys but just because I
know if you if you play really like this
jacket I thought show you and it goes so
nicely with the Navy trousers that's why
I'm really liking it and with the white
body hello white strapless bra why can't
they make these fabrics work better why
it just looks like skin in a white bra
like it just doesn't look good such a
shame they're like the petite as well
fits me fine it's not petite at all it's
like same size as the other one but yeah
it's a see-through
this is the way it looks anyway one of
the pieces I'm really really excited
about though that I saw and now it's car
key game but I really love this blazer
so I picked this up this is a kind of
more premium like Topshop exclusive
collection this is sixty-five pounds so
for kind of exclusive collection it's
not too bad I did get this in the UK
eight there which fits really well at
the UK six having a little bit too tight
on me actually I usually always get six
but I loved it and with kind of the
collar popped on this it looks really
quite sophisticated another piece I
bought was this body I really wanted
this in black I couldn't find it in
black this is more of a cream but I
thought this would be gorgeous layered
can you even see that it's quite blown
out it's so bright but I thought this
layered under kike a cool shirt or a
stripy shirt could look really quite
cool um so that's what I've gone for
like I probably wouldn't wear this on
its own I might wear it under the Blazer
but I wouldn't wear it on its own
probably because I feel a little bit too
overexposed and that's just me though
but I think over a sort of a shirt
that's open quiet kind of baggy and cool
it might look quite pretty and look
almost like a little larger a bodysuit
underneath we'll see we'll see I haven't
tried this on again it was kind of I
tried on a few things and went back and
found more things and couldn't be
bothered trying them on so let's try
some together I'll try this on with this
blazer okay so this I've just paired the
jacket and the body with a pair of
Topshop Joni jeans I think in black but
I'll leave a link down below and over
not in the hall but I just have these
with me but yeah how beautiful is this
blazer I just think it's such a cool
easy piece like it's a very tailored fit
but then I feel you should wear it for
so many different occasions but more
kind of casual I have to really love the
whole tailored stylingg
so that's what I go for quite often
whether that's with like a lacy top or
kind of like a very kind of sloppy loose
top underneath at a sink a tailored
blazer pulls everything together
this looks quite cool so yeah I really
love this and it fits wonderfully I love
it with the collar tear ducts I always
self pop my collar one of those kind of
people yeah I think it's a really
gorgeous color and I love
actually love this body the body is
really really pretty
although a little bit too short for me
so I think I'm going to keep it but I'm
going to take it back and get an 8 but I
think it's perfect for what I was saying
about having under a shirt I really love
it underneath this blaze or actually I
think it's one of those pieces I could
wear quite often if I'm wearing it under
quite a statement piece like a blazer I
think it works really well and I really
love the shape and fit and the colors
yeah a little bit few more bits how cute
are these glasses
I got these glasses from toy shades in
Topshop they were 25 pounds never really
heard of toy shape before but really
like these are a matte tortoiseshell
with the cool big frames and the fact
325 queered of time I've have - these
are great I really like the silver
around the bottom as well my hair feels
dead different because I've had it done
by someone else today for shoots it
doesn't feel like me sir so a few bit
like she doesn't look right probably why
but yeah I thought these were really
great I've been wearing these quite a
bit in my snapchats and things the tire
shades logo is very kind of Tory Burch
inspired maybe that's why I liked it but
yet 25 pounds such a bargain well they
call sort of big statement glasses the
fact these are only 25 quid is pretty
amazing a really cool style another
thing I got which have already been
using from skinny jet I always usually
get skinny dip foam cases because let's
be honest they're kind of ahead of the
game and they have such great
collections of cool quirky prints so
anyway this was 14 pounds for the iPhone
6 plus case and it looks like the ice
cream there was so many I could have
gone for there were like unicorns there
were whales with unicorn holes now walls
it all but I just really liked the ice
creams its glittery this cliff is by
gonna come off at some point but I like
the fact it's also see-through so you
can see the rose gold of my iPhone
beneath it but it was quite cute yet so
I'll treat myself to a new case
on the subject of unicorns I also bought
some unicorn tissue because I recently
had a pack very similar to this and
they're really handy how they just it's
open and inside of Ollie tissues and
then if I'm not mistaking on the tissues
oh they're just plain
oh well that's upsetting there's plain
tissues I'm sure I usually have like
prints on them not today anyway you just
have a really handy pack of tissues and
I thought they were super cute I mean on
reflection bit ridiculous into five and
you could buy a small pack of tissues
for like normal pack for 50p I really
like them and I was in a queue you know
I want these so unicorn tissue and last
is this last pitch assures his last last
but not least these are almost gone but
these are my favorite ever sweets the
Eton Mess candy kittens are so delicious
I brought them with me obviously for the
soul but also because I wanted to jump
on them and if I left them at home ants
would've eaten all of them don't lie
Alex yes what what the so grain is
likely will come the kittens they
literally my favorite sweets I love this
so much
also do you for three pound food pound
you can probably get them a little bit
cheaper elsewhere but I always pick up a
pack when I'm in Topshop and that is
everything guys kind of feel like I'm
forgetting something here but maybe I'm
not I'm sure I brought everything with
me so everything what do you think of
the whole let me know kind of feel quite
smug about this whole I feel like I've
got some really greatly pieces I'm gonna
melt a style up for Louis different
occasions so I kind of feel quite good
again about my wardrobe for this kind of
summer months let me know though which
was your favorite piece and if you're
loving anything at Topshop that maybe
I've not seen a mist but everything in
the whole as always will be linked down
below so if you like it you can go along
