from stellar car you might seen in a
recent outfit whole and really beautiful
clothes but for that and then a
red lip this is with the Mac cherry lip
liner and night moss around the edges to
give it more of an ombre effect and I've
gone for a really cool gold smokey eye

you
good morning so didn't if you managed to
catch anything that kind of happened
last night
but generally we came back got ready we
went up to Brian he's our tour guide
went up to his room and we got some huge
30-inch pizzas which I'm sure you saw
which were massive so we all sort of ate
a bit of those a bit being gamut of word
there and then we went out so we got on
a party bus which was cool again when
she saw with all the flashing lights and
the stripper poles that are thin and we
went to a few different places we went
to the Bellagio fountains and I went to
the Vegas sign took pictures and I think
and then they dropped us off at a club
called XS and XS was like an outdoor
beach party thing which was crazy
everyone assumed that the bikinis having
drinks and chatting and the deejay
people danced him so something that
England doesn't have whatsoever but it
was still really really cool and I made
sure I didn't drink too much because
last time I was here I drank far too
much I feel awful the next day so I
wanted to sort of enjoy my day and go to
swimming pool today and ever thinks
that's not going to do and we saw on the
way home last night we saw an IHOP on
the way so we're gonna try and find the
IHOP go for breakfast come back sit by
the pool all day look and just enjoy the
day so that is the plan should also
mention as well that today I'm wearing
my Taylor Morris sunglasses my ELF space

bikini as well so I'm pretty much
wearing everything from beach cafe and
