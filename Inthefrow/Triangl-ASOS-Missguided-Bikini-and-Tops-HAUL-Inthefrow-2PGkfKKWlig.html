because I've got lots of lovely new
products to show you
starting with let me start with this top
actually cuz I really love this top this
is from a Bronco mombasa rose and it
looks like this it's got a lettuce
cooked effect around the waist a cute
little tank style and extremely city's
got darts here to the bust so it's
extremely fitted and I find extremely
flattering for me it's just off white
creamy ivory shade and it goes with
everything so I've been wearing it with
these jeans these jeans are from boohoo
and like a paint splatter Jean with a
couple of rips rips in the knees rip up
here with wires just go straight down
the bottom and yeah really really like
there to fit those yeah so this top is
from about Mombasa rose and it's
probably I don't
you might be saying any prices just go
along to subscriptions below and you can
find everything there I'm going to go
into bikinis actually cuz I've got quite
a few to show you I thought I might
start with those so this bikini to show
you is from triangle
I love triangle now for quite a while
and they have been lovely enough to send
me some new pieces one of them being
this one and you might recognize this
it's a style of the underwear that they
do as well and so many people said we
wanted it in swimwear
so the browser swimwear it's a I don't
if the camera really shows up just how
stunning this is it's almost like a
luminescent neon orange II substitute my
shade almost like an neon some silver
can you imagine that with electron's
so flattering it fits like a brass I
just feel that you and brass you feel
really supported super flattering really
stunning and I love those and I think
they are around $55 for all the set
couple more bikinis are from ASOS I love
this how beautiful is this completely
gemmed
all over in a beautiful aqua turquoise
and then it comes with bottoms which are
a high-waisted bottom can put the plane
in the back but gemmed
although the front so the two together
are string so pretty also have this one
from a sauce which is a more floral
style print greens reds and oranges
almost like a midi grass cover just
below you as well so pretty
so sterling also have this one as well
and like band a style so this is the Sun
down it does come with straps front it
halter neck as well there's an a
beautiful pastel purple and white
striped
Becht and
ordinary matching bottoms so there are
from a sauce
Oh another bikini you found the bikini
yes I haven't even tried on yet this is
from sweet cui Hui 8 it's French
hu IT 8 so oh this is so cute that means
fasten it up actually my help and those
cool or in your fastenings and it looks
like this it's so cute how cute is that
it almost reminds me of a suit jacket
with the button ops on what someone
would wear to a wedding but it's souped
putting the bikini really pretty and
then the bottoms have a large BAM to the
front so two together they look really
quite sophisticated and classic as a
bikini cell so I'm quite excited about
wearing them I've got another bikini
whoopsie it's just in my collection I
did realize another triangle bikini this
is this time in the black almost leather
look style and this time it has straps
over the top I don't have to go for
these kind of genius because you get
this
jump over the top look but really really
love legs so flattering on really pretty
I really like this strap around the
center I think it's something quite
flattering about strap about with really
around the middle and then that comes
with these little um Kiwi buttons my
boyfriend size of the day and father
hilarious he thought they were like
almost like wrestling buttons what the
guys now seriously
yeah these the buttons come with them I
think I'm really sorry
I love them lovely fact when this video
goes up hopefully I will be internally
wearing these bikinis so if you want to
catch it with what I'm doing right now
then check out my Instagram Twitter I'll
be on there so it's got a Twitter just
both at in the throat blood also be
wearing this brand new swimming costume
this is from jaded London I love JD
London and it's so cute completely cut
out box it's got almost like a bun down
but around the back goes into the NICUs
at the bottom but all the rest the back
is cut out it cuts down the front as
well love leaves it down the front of
you boss really flattering such a cool
favorite print I love this next got this
a cute little lacy crop this is from
pretty lavish hopefully you can see the
lights but it's lacy it's got a button
down the front lovely lacy trim to the
button get little straps that are
adjustable so you can just a size it's
not overly corrupt which I like this
lace bit just kind of covers your
stomach and it's super flattering and
absolutely beautiful I've been wearing
that with these jeans we've had to been
wearing everything with these jeans
these are from Joe's Jeans
and they're in the so soft range so they
feel almost like suede fabric
super soft ordinary kind of skinny legg
really flattering
three pockets on the back a little Joe's
Jeans labeling and that's it otherwise
just a plain kind of dusty pinky shade
real of those and they haven't gone
everything recently okay what else do we
have
I've got this tab arou top I really love
tappero
I've want a very quite a few times in
these halls really quite cool innovative
print styles very abstract nothing that
you'd ever really found out how to do
which is what I really love about them
I've got this in a very oversized style
so I'm from the medium so it's been more
oversized but it's still crop cute
little sleeves and a different print
really lovely and the fabric is so
luxurious is amazing quality like this
is the kind of thing I'd pick up in
Selfridges in a designer label and think
that's beautiful quality yeah highly
recommend taproot a lot this is my
personal favorite from misguided peach
to the top on the bottom hem white all
over the wise extremely fitted it's
really flattering on and it's got these
soft bands that goes around the middle
of the waist so so I was like a double
effect around the button around the
waist and it's only like a tenner so it
looks it just goes to so many things a
love that I'm going to throw this in I
realize this isn't a top or a bottom but
it's just arrived in the post and it's
really pretty so I wanted to show you so
please don't be mad but it's a dress
it's the one only one dress I'm going to
show you and it's this one and it's from
in the style of thing really pretty I
hope you can see how neon this is can
you see
and the illnesses may be lying's a bit
right but it's this is a neon pink with
white body calm and two very small
straps to topple go just over the top
so super flattering really pretty lovely
lass a fabric can't go wrong as a
holiday piece let's get into a few more
favorites so this little top is from
Wonderland clothing and I mean it's
quite see-through in places kind of the
hub of little holes which is where a
light brown and it's absolutely fine
can't I thought they would go
beautifully with these little shop and I
from taking off the tag what is wrong
with me these little shorts from Stelly
clothing I show you a lot of clothes I
really like the Australian brand how
beautiful is that print that it's almost
like watercolor and stained-glass window
effect sort of thing
beautiful lace trim to the bottom a
little button at the front and the zip
and we love these so much they fit so
nicely so those with that handle that's
I got from mrs. love song I featured a
dress that matches this in my dresses
fall
this is so cute look okay that is little
tiny bralette literally really quite
tight it's not that much in terms of
width but it's got a double strap to the
back this almost reminds a bit of the
Rihanna River Island question that she
did that was far more sports looks and a
bit more kind of Street urban really
liked it a lot that is really cute and I
thought it would look really nice with
this skirt which is also very much a
sport
looks locker room style trend completely
black on the bottom until you get these
two stripes
adidas dry cask um we're gonna cute to
jeers material so it fits can't really
go wrong with boohoo they're really nice

their going to pin label with these I
absolutely love these for a brand called

backing and size and the very bottom
elastic edge as well a super flattering
