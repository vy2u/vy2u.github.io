always good hey guys good morning if
Thursday morning and we're going to the
gym doing a morning gym session today
I've got a few things on the agenda
later so get out of the way now I have
been oh I've been helping my skin care
game in the hopes of battling this beast
I spoke with Caroline hyerin's last
night if you know Caroline and she's
like the skin care guru she's such an
expert on everything skin care she's
amazing she has her own blog she's got a
YouTube channel she's so clued up if you
need any help in skincare
go have a look at her blog she will
fully answer the question on there
anyway I text the last night was like
Caroline have a beef growing in my face
what should I do
so she said in case any of you guys are
in this predicament right now she said
to use an acid over the face so I
cleanse this and I use an acid so I used
let me show you what I used
laughter here is not much helps to share
with you today so I'm really really
really getting into
DCL right now so I use the cleanser
first off from DCL then I usually used
to really join right now I've used a few
times recently the DCL multi-action
Pinta peels and it's a lot of pads like
pants that soaked an acid and you
literally after you've cleansed you just
wipe it all of your face for about three
to five minutes and then you wash it all
off and it just illness helped kind of
create a very soft peel on the face it
just can't take off that just like
exfoliate any dead skin off so that
hopefully opened up and then I just
literally doused it in kaylz banana
covering oil last night and then I put
an amazing like DCL serum on this
vitamin C serum and then I put on their
peptide cream after and honestly my skin
today feels incredible a lot all the
blemishes that I've had recently are
very much smaller today it's just this
one but it's feeling better like it
doesn't hurt anymore today which is good
I thought the rest of my skin feels
amazing so I'm hoping I'm gonna keep
using this DCL everyday I'm not gonna
get anything else that's gonna make this
DCL routine that I've got back from the
gym and just had a little stop off at
Brett I heard of the day that Pratt just
released some new vegan stuff so we went
