back yesterday early morning I think and
then we just we did just kind of now I
know you're not meant to but we turn up
and then yes II was just let you -
sucker Margaret she'll capture work
kanaday so today is today's Tuesday I
have a nail appointment I've just turned
on my tan looks like this I'm just gonna
point that out now because it's not the
best I mean look at those why's that not
so harshly when I did this I'll be fine
tomorrow I'm gonna get my nails done
because they look atrocious some have
completely come off and and therefore
have snapped you know so I'm going to
dry by now to get that done it feels
nice quite on the face of makeup for
once my throat is still not completely
right so my voice is still a little bit
funny I'm getting there getting my
appetite back
it's been 10 days now it's sickness and
I'll see I couldn't go to the doctors
and get antibiotics but I'm running out
I'm riding out I'll be fine anyway so
I'm in a rush as always I'm gonna head
to drive by and then to gleam to see how
managers and catch up I made it I am
monitoring somehow just about like maybe
so cute in here it's unlike Christmasy
Oh No okay guys so time is it 9:00 it's
9 o'clock after I went and got my nails
done which look like this this is the
color I think it's called
Oh cold oh I can't even remember what
it's called Oh No yes oh no way so got
this lovely like shiny glittery on my
hands had to have them all really cut
down so many had broken my hand Tan is
often a bath scrub in a minute and my
feet I got the similar as well so I feel
a little bit more put together now which
is great I'm gonna do some masking
though in a little bit I've got some
L'Oreal masks I wanna do cuz not had a
mask in like a month so me fired but yes
after that I went into Glee and some
managers had a good little catch-up
about everything it's been going on
while I've been away I felt very much
out of it
and I also got to pick up some of the
things from my P o box a few different
brands have sent me to try out to review
and see what I thought about them and
let's just say I have a sack full of
amazing things so feel extremely
extremely grateful and I thought I'd
just show you a few a few things you
might like to see one of the first
things that was sent up today whilst
some new mats from L'Oreal I already
have a lot of things but I am running
low because they're my most used masks
and I'd say I think it's because I know
they work for my skin they don't break
me out I really like the texture and the
feel of them either to wash away and I
like the fact that you can multi masks
with them so I find them the easiest
thing to reach for like it's fuss-free
enough to think about it and know what
I'm doing it that's why I think I really
like them so I've got no whole
collection this is pulling my favorite
the pure clay detox mask it's a black
one I've got this but they've also come
out with this one I believe the pure
clay
bright mask they're excited about that
even stone illuminates
I'm sure you guys have probably seen a
lot of these anyway bought the pure clay
in the green purity mask there's a
blemish rescue mask which is in the loo
which clears and unclogs and then the
red one is the glow mask
and exfoliate it is very cool just all
of them just explains I thought they are
what they're for why you may need to use
them and how to use them and it's just
usually for me ten minutes on and then
off so these are stopped on a sauce now
so once you get your outfit you can now
get your masks pretty awesome but the
fact with these it's kind of like a play
kit in fact I think yeah it's called the
play kit can I get a little bit of masks
of each one you get the green one the
black one which of my two favorites and
you also get the the orange e red one
you've got pure two masks detox mask
glowy mask it kind of shows you as well
like ways to use it for a de-stress if
it's post night out post-workout it kind
of suggests ways to put them on so
bearing in mind this one's for purity
this one's a detox and this one's for
glow you can just kind of play around
and put them in places that you want so
I'm gonna be using that later but I just
thought the fact it's on any sauce now
makes it really really easy to get hold
of and it's a very easy to get to kind
of play around the product the body shop
sent me some incredible incredible
things like their new gifts for
Christmas which they always do amazing
as always been a huge huge huge fan of
