refill a video I filmed over a year ago
now when I first said my channel
it was a tutorial with the naked basics
palette it's something I just bought I
thought I would do a bit of a tutorial
of how that they could use all the
shades and palette so I made the video
and ever since in all honesty and I
really did like the video I just felt I
was really awkward because I don't need
to start YouTube ever since senate's
from the video I've always thought about
taking down it so I thought instead I
would refill the video for you so that's
what that is today it's gonna be from
the Naked basics palette it's got a
mixture of six different shades
obviously I've been using this now for
over a year so I've hit pan on some of
those shades and so I'm sorry it's not
as brand-new as it could be but it's
just very very well loved so if you want
to know how I often do a very neutral
eye look or the Naked basics palette
then please keep watching I'm going to
use the wo s shade is kind of the
lightest champagne color
foxy next to it it's more of a yellow
tone so feel free to use that but I like
to use more champagne e shade so I'm
going to use my Mac 207 officer brush
and I'm going to place that into the
inner corner I'm not over lit if you
want to then what I like to do is to go
in with the Naked 2 shade which is the
lightest Brown in the palette I'm going
to take out the same brush the maxium on
seven and I'm going to press that into
the crease so you can close your eyes
and the crease remove that along
Unitas apply that a little bit more on
to the very out to that corner and drag
it down onto lower lash line so creates
almost like a cat eye effect in the
shadow
you can then either leave it like this
and do the rest the steps I'm about to
do or you could do what I'm about to do
which is just darken up those and the
edge of the creases so I'm gonna take
the faint which is the dark brown the
same brush again and just it's a very
outer corner add in that shade then at
this stage when you call off a cliff
light I'm just going to take the Sigma
e30 seven brush and blend all that
together so it's very tough at the
crease I'm just gonna make sure that I'm
nicely blend that there's no harsh lines
and it looks like you can't face what's
with the shutter okay so at this point
all of your eye shadow shoe blended like
really beautiful I can fade up so this
is a time we can now starting I like to
color so I'm going to now use Athena's
which is an only shimmery shade and
palette it's a champagne shimmer and I'm
just going to add that into the very
inner corner and then also to my brow
bone
so it was really really bright answers
up and also I lift up the eyebrow bone
with a little bit of shimmer okay so
probably my favorite thing about this
palette is what I use it for my brows so
I use Naked 2 and faint I'm also a faint
it's more of a cat's evening dew and I
want to kind of really dark not my brows
and on a day to day I usually use a
mixture of the two
so I'm gonna take the bobbi brown eye
definer which I'm finding to be
incredible for doing eyebrows it's just
a really stiff brush so create perfect
shape so I'm going to take a little bit
of huge shadows and start with my
eyebrows now at this point you could
enjoy ass eyebrow gel already on your
eyebrows and I stick better or you can
add it later to get their shape it's
completely up to you I have to our thing
so today I'm just going to do this way
so I start by just drawing out the very
front and bottom line of my lash my
eyebrow rather all that down to tailor
the end then in little sweeping motions
almost to create the look of this little
eyebrow hence why does often first
upwards so brush up the hairs keep the
correct shape around in this is where
you can add some of your eyebrow gel
keep all of that in place all day to
remove any excess powder
okay so eyebrows done and I'm gonna move
on the very last step I use this palette
which is the eyeliner so I'm going to
use the Clinique I definer brush getting
basements of our Brown but not quite as
stiff just a little bit of crave on the
very end we can stay with faint taking
pictures why not
and just to run that along to how far
off you guys taste your eyeliner as well
so you can solve without yourself are
you to do but halfway along
a little bit long hello lashline as well
in a John - that sucks
and then finally just need a coat of
mascara and then we'll be done and that
is it super super simple
I absolutely doors palette I use I could
say I use it every single day for my
eyebrows it's great for traveling you
can throw it in your bag you know you
can get your eyebrows your eyeshadow in
highlight bro brow bone with it it's
just so so simple and easy it's only 20
pounds so again you're getting so many
different products with 20 pounds with
it's pretty cool product so yeah I
really hope you enjoyed this don't
forget to Like and subscribe if you did
I can be found as always I've written it
to grab that in the fro or my blog and
throat car and hopefully I'll see you
all again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
