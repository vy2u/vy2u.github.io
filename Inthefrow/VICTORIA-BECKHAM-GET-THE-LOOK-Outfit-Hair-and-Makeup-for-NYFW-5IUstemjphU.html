be a full Victoria back in Rio at
Fashion Week get a look I just really
wanted to put this together the amount
of people that were mentioning like
where did you get a jeans from where
shoes from where the top from what's she
wearing on her lips etc etc and so when
this I was really intrigued since well
majority of our makeup was from the new
VB Estee Lauder line which is why I was
in New York and first place so I went
across with those guys to meet Victoria
to have a little mini interview with her
to watch the show it was like the most
dreamy trip ever
this is glamour by the way this video
isn't sponsored they haven't asked me to
do it I just really really wanted to put
this together
sorry be quite fun to do and I've never
really done anything like this before so
this is a full Victoria backing it look
from makeup to hair to the full outfit
obviously I'm blonde and it doesn't look
quite the same as the gorgeous brunette
and dark eyebrows and all that kind of
thing but this is my interpretation I
don't know exactly what she was using on
her face all I know is that it was vb
Estee Lauder so that's exactly what I've
used and I've kind of interpreted it my
way oh and if you do want to see a bit
more behind the scenes and also some
pictures from the show that's all over
my blog already in the fro comm so let's
have a little peek at that if you would
like to see a little bit more but if you
like to see this whole VB look as well
as her outfit and how I interpret it
then continue watching ok so it's
starting off with a like super moist dry
space because Victoria had really glowy
radiant skin on this day I think it's
down to a very very good skincare
routine which to be honest I also really
like to try and use a really really good
skincare routine I'm just use the my
favorites right now the bare minerals
good longevity of battle power eye gel
cream when you go in with the Chanel
Hydra Beauty micro cream which I'm
almost out of and it's like my favorite
thing ever this is super hydrating it
lets loose soaks into my skin my skin
loves it so much feels like a very very
lightweight gel has these little beads
in it I think we have chamomile in them
something like that something absolutely
amazing anyway that kind of like pop and
add so much moisture but it adds great
great base for makeup now my skin is
like really like juicy and moisturize
okay
let's kick this off with some Phoebe so
Phoebe morning aura is one of the hero
products of the initial line and
so into this one so this is a product
gorgeous casing and this can be used as
a moisturizer primer illuminator
everything I like adding it over the top
of my moisturizer because I like got
really moisturized hydrated feel before
I'd make up this just finish it off the
skin was so much like luminosity and
radiance it's just like a pick-me-up to
the skin in the morning beautiful
okay so let's go in with some foundation
shall we I want to give this a go on
camera this day Lord at double wear nude
water fresh makeup have not used this
yet I hope this is the correct shade for
me actually
I've got shade ecru one end - I've got
Chanel brush money that this the whole
theme of this Victoria Beckham lock was
that she did look so flawless but she
wasn't caped my foundation and a base to
slipped very very lightweight so I don't
really want to add absolutely loads here
like to still look really fresh and
eliminated I think I'm already
preferring this to double wells for sure
double wear has never been a foundation
I've really ever used and honestly it's
always been a bit too heavy for my skin
it's has never really appealed to me in
that way but this I could definitely get
on board with yeah so I don't know apply
too much here I want to keep it really
really fresh but you know me I do
usually like to add a lot of foundation
but that's looking good really glowy a
mini fresh and you can see the morning
or a sort of kicking out a little bit
there just gonna take a Beauty Blender
just working this into the rest of the
skin just for concealer I'm gonna go in
with just my absolute favorite at all
times pretty much that's just a tart
shape tape and again I'm not gonna go in
like mega heavy just want to be quite
light here
okay this is so much better I wasn't
going to risk having that Sun going in
now the entire time in this video so
we're on actual artificial lights now
now you can actually see how nice my
skin looks with this foundation so hard
to get into the hairline when you've got
white hair
okay just select a pan add some Burt's
Bees just so they can be being nice and
prepped it was gonna go onto a phone or
something make sure I get the exact
right feel on this okay so I mean she's
got much more hooded lids than I do but
it's all very dark and smoky and there's
mixed different shade in there I'm gonna
start off with this palette
with the black and this it's more of a
nudie Beijing looks here I'm just gonna
run that all over the eye and also into
the crease give us a really nice nude
base the nicest alone not just very
neutral but because this is me I want to
add a little bit of warmth and just bit
of this bronzer this isn't a saffron Sun
tiny bit more of that since the very
crease touch more warm that's because
I'm trying to make it wearable for me as
well and the way that I often like to do
my makeup and I like warm tones so just
a touch more warmth so on the actual eye
I could use a black out of this palette
but I want to use this quad palette in a
way I'm kind of trying to show you a few
different products as well as we go
along almost I can kind of review them
for you and show you what I'm liking as
I'm going through
so although this isn't gonna be
absolutely perfect as to what she use
hadn't asked her purse or the exact
amount of products and it's gonna be a
range of these anyway she was definitely
wearing called her own products I'm just
going to use a flat brush I'm just gonna
start working a little bit of this black
into the lash line and also just over
the lid crease family she was patting it
with what I already have on the brush
I'm not trying to build this up to be
too heavy because it wasn't really
really heavy her eye makeup but I'm
gonna intensify this color a little I'm
just building up the base at this point
going in with a touch more the black
closer to this lash line gonna get a bit
of a gradient from dark here to a little
lighter up at the top I'm just going
back to my neutral shade again blending
that out
okay that's perfect it's quite dark but
also not too dark that we can't do
anything else above it which is what I'm
gonna be going for yeah and it's gonna
blend out that top edge now this is a
bit that I absolutely love this product
it's called bit of clove and it's like a
it's a very deep bronze I feel has
almost like green gold flecks in there
almost it's so so beautiful and she
definitely had this on her lids so
that's why I want to add the black so
then I'm going to add this on the top
and it'll just look even more intensive
over the black she's gonna kind of go
everywhere
milked out everywhere this is just
pulling everything together that we've
done beneath it but we'll just add a bit
more dimension bitter clove is so
beautiful isn't it it's gonna go into
the white of the quod palette and just
dump it into my inner corners now which
are just really like eyeliner and there
are three different ones in this
collection there's a brown there's a
blue and it's also a black this one I'm
using is the brown it's called Java I'm
just gonna add it to the lash line these
are unbelievably creaming some of the
creamiest eyeliners I've possibly ever
used to take a brush and go along this
just to smoke out into that bit of clove
I'm sort of pushing it upwards I'm
winging any excess err as well you know
what I didn't think this was going to be
slightly more dark brown it's much more
sort of ready tone brown so I'm gonna go
over with the black it's all good we can
just go over it with a bit of luck and
not be absolutely fine you know I
actually really like that but it wasn't
quite what she was wearing
I don't want it to be too prominent so
I'm just gonna go back into my bitter
clove and go over the top of that as
well let's tell the smudge it all out
black I love that that looks really
great now it just makes it look a little
bit more intensive towards the upper
lash line now okay I know what I'm gonna
wear now or autumn all the time I love
this do you know I've not worn eyeliner
in so long I used to watch my channel a
while back like when I first started I
would wear winged liner every single day
and now I just don't wear eyeliner at
all
yeah and just finished it off with the
bitter clove of the top and just keep
brushing that upwards okay I absolutely
love it I love it clear this up a little
bit before we add some under-eye it's
gonna use a little bit at the nose as
always a little bit more coverage
underneath so really perfect that if so
I'm gonna move into bronzer first of all
on this Real Techniques brush she
definitely had a lovely bronzed glow
around the edges of her face and on her
cheeks this is a gorgeous problem
they're actually refusing a small
verses to get a little more definition
of where I would use the contour okay
when that's all started it's gonna go
with a bigger brush and give my neck
no more over where I've been just to
enhance all that a little more I don't
really want to look too contouring I
want to just like bronze skin really
overall now on the cheeks this is so
beautiful to cheek cream in blonde mink
I'm just gonna use that on stippling
brush and Victoria said that she likes
to apply it a little higher on the cheek
just to lift them a little so that's
what I'm going to do and you could see
that she had done this it looked really
really great actually I never thought to
do it a little higher on the cheeks but
it does let them lovely glow that's the
cheeks I love that now highlight this is
some modern mercury highlights I kind of
got purple everywhere for that of the
brush this is a modern mercury
highlighter and it's absolutely stunning
so I can't not use this I don't think
she was using too much highlight but I
can't not use this for this routine I'm
gonna add a little bit in main reason I
did one time too much highlight is
because I know she was used in the aura
gloss which she totally swears by and as
now one of my favorites too this is in
honey I think honey so it's like a gold
gel B can't least see the gold on the
actual skin but she just likes to Pat it
onto the high points of face which is
why I don't have too much ordered this
to kind of be a center stage really if I
love adding it there it too here on to
the lid so let's all give him a little
more she also likes to add it to the
lips as they bomb and it's quite nice
base for lipstick as well and then so
now we are super super glowy I'm gonna
add one of her favorite products this is
a skin perfecting powder isn't this just
absolutely beautiful it's a stunning
case and then you've got the powder
inside and it really is gorgeous I'm
just gonna add this where I want to
conceal a little bit my pores set my
under eye and it's so light gorgeous you
know what I'm too excited to like one of
the lip first and finish
a little bit more news we've got a
really flat base to start this with I'm
gonna use the Victoria lip liner which
is one of her favorites just to give
that some shape it's very lightly I'm
rubbing it and I don't want to be too
much personally like we're in liners
like this when you can blend it in and
it's there but it's not really obvious
I'm gonna add a little bit of the
burnished rose just some very center
very very lightly that's just for a tiny
tiny splash of pink I love these
lipsticks is three in the collection and
then there are two lip glosses in this
collection we've got the more clear
gloss it's almost like a golden pearl
essence in there and a beautiful nude
gloss I'm gonna go for the clear cuz I
want to kind of keep this color but make
it glossy so all that's left really is
to shave some dry and Shea's I'm just
gonna go back to set in wha and for nill
i Pollock's this is lovely a matte I'm
just gonna take it underneath could also
do it liner and I'm just gonna take the
brush to add the line around a little
bit I mean I never really look good with
this kind of eye it always looks too
heavy on me but it's us her statement
lock isn't it so it's nice and smoky
okay mascara she has a lovely new
mascara barely any kind of friction when
you pull this out and the idea is that
it has loads and loads of product on
there so you can really paint
okay I'm sorry she's this brush it's
great this is the first time I'm trying
this mascara I don't think I've tried
anything like this it's such a thin
brush and it's gripping onto every
single one of my lashes my gosh okay and
not stuff to do is my eyebrow so I'll be
right back okay done face complete love
this eye makeup look overall especially
with this kind of smoked out liner to
the top that smote into the bitter clove
it looks so pretty very pleased and I
think that almost kind of got that
Aussie I didn't know the exact products
that she used coz I didn't ask her but
this is just kind of like my
interpretation of what she did with her
own products so I kind of hope you
so with makeup done I'm gonna move on to
doing the hair and also the outfit I'm
gonna put on the white t-shirt now just
if I can do the hair without ruining it
by then putting on the white t-shirt
yeah let's get into her hair and makeup
okay so should I be the middle part and
thing going on
nan berry mind her hair was here she
does had it cut and she but the cutest a
little Bob which I would love to have at
some point it almost looked like she
kind of was hot
how did it like a bit like this then it
was over here and it was a strawberry
it's a bit messy oh cool shot these cute
little bit coming out so I'm just kind
of like playing with it really here and
it was in a very sweet
low bun now she all have done this all
using pins code out your nail to get a
hair into it or bill otherwise so I'm
just going to just keep twisting my hair
and it's wrapping it to get the overall
bun shape but tie it with a just we've
got a bun shape and then I'm gonna go in
with pins and just start pinning this
down into much better shape it's still
also a little messy little bits like
wispy bits coming out sauces chef short
hair okay cool
right now it was much more messy on top
so I'm just gonna try and like pull out
some bits leaves a little bit spray just
miss this off
it was just sort of really easily done
you know like she'd almost like thrown
up herself but after she will have had
someone do it for her but I think so I
don't know ya feel like that worked that
was kind of exactly like how she had it
do you know what I'm still not happy
with this lip it's still looking at her
now she looks look like she's got a
little bit more nude than this all I'm
doing is adding a tiny smidge of
concealer into that glass just a cooler
a little bit that's better
definitely I'm not bitch I have like an
orange eat own toilets
oranga nude and at that is this right
okay we gotta cut that in the end okay
so this is the hair okay love it so onto
the Alpha
okay this is the whole VB look yt blue
jeans and heels now if the heels hear me
out here things aren't like she was
wearing her brand-new spring/summer 18
lilac heels which I think will also
patent beautiful but obviously not out
yet until about March April
so instead seeing is it's this season
and red is so big it said I went for red
to mix it up a bit and I love these
shoes so much these are some really easy
pair of red shoes away the kind of cool
around the edge of the thought is so
flattering
honestly I'm in love with these so good
choice I think also the jeans she was
wearing Levi's vintage Levi's which
obviously I couldn't find cheap on
government thrift store or somewhere
else so these are the best back thing I
could find and we'll just something
that's gonna rob loom raw hem on the
very bottom a little bit of a shorter
length but also more of a mom Jean
highway style and look at all the
pictures that I've got other than it I
kind of feel like they work really
really well it really matches what she
was wearing attempt it's a color but fit
the shape everything so and these are
actually really really affordable then
you're like 35-pound most so yeah these
are really really good joob and then the
white t-shirt I wanted something looked
good quality because her look like
amazing quality you couldn't see a bra
underneath it which always shows a
really good white t-shirt I think this
one works pretty well she also had quite
long sleeves on hers which I think she'd
rolled up but they were around this
length anyway and I actually really love
this length and the structure of the
shoulders her t-shirt was also slightly
oversized so I've gone up one size to
size small instead of a 5 XS sounded a
little bit more oversized fit so they
could tuck into the jeans pull out a
little bit and just have that more boxy
style so I feel like this works really
really well for how she was dressed so
overall I think I've done a pretty good
job pieces together I can't wait to see
what you guys think but overall I love
this outfit I want to wear this now for
the next few weeks especially these
heels and I'm just in
okay guys that's it what do you think of
first of all the makeup look do you
think I kind of got it I feel like I'm
pretty much pretty much there with it
especially now I managed to get the lip
a little more nude and then with the
gloss I'm so much happier with this now
yeah love this hair what am i doing this
hair a lot more think it's really sweet
how do you think I did with the outfit I
know I changed up the shoe color because
I look it's just know what to be seen
right now I know I changed up the color
of the heels but that's because I
thought I'd make it more appropriate for
now and red is just everything I'm about
right now
so I really hope you enjoy this look
