vlog part 2 like I said I displays up
just a little bit more short and concise
so it's our last day actually I spent
the morning doing some blog posts so if
you'd like to know more about this trip
then it's go long - in the fro calm and
lobby some blog posts all about the trip
exactly why I'm here and what I'm up to
and all of that so I was up late doing
that and then someone was ringing our
bell at four am waking is up so I had
the best sleep ever but we have just had
an incredible breakfast we decided to
eat back at the hotel room again because
he didn't quite have enough time to get
downstairs so alex has like a scrambled
egg again and his cappuccino and we've
got a juices this is a watermelon mango
juice today which sounds amazing fruit
salad and I went for the eggs benedict
with a spinach I'm gonna have a lemon
water cuz I've got a really bad throat
today you know we're on our way out
again today we're going to go and do a
little bit more sightseeing we're gonna
go look around the shops properly go
into more of Hong Kong and do a little
bit more sightseeing and and all that
yeah make thank you for today
Brij Mason Street shots
no the child is raining
it can be fun but how are you these
these pictures but if you've not seen
them already go to the throat
so who's gonna get a walk around
right now
didn't know it's a little
student
and with that one
but having been caramel machine over
here
inspect our husbands
day
how many of the name three well
time for the pool I'm not seeing it yet
Alex he's already been in some pretty
excited I've got this triangle up there
kini yarn and cute little eyelet buttons
hanging my return I was a saint once
it's quite funny because I know that
I've been told Nicky Hilton's here and
also hailey Baldwin for the same event
that I'm doing they're more models and
celebs but anyway it's quite funny
because she modelled this bikini for
triangles she was like the model for
this brand new bikini but it's a really
really nice bikini actually yes just
from triangle and it go to the pool and
also wet by the pool because we've just
got all the pictures off onto a computer
I need to kind of get them all sorted
for the vlog I'm going to edit the first
Hong Kong vlog now
check out this view now they missed you
can still kind of see the mess across
here but at least it's sort of dropped a
bit I guess signature see the tops of
buildings there but yeah just got back
from an epic fail of a swimming session
I like didn't really tell me what the
deal was at the pool and the jacuzzi I
was expecting an indoor pool with lots
places to sit I could do my work by the
pool would be really nice and chilled
and really lovely but yeah in fact it's
not at all that's just what I was kind
of imagining and that's what you can
just not really told me it wasn't that
so in fact it was just an outdoor pool
and an outdoor jacuzzi
so we went back in darkness like will
drag on the indoor turkeys and he was
like yeah Alex L didn't realize that
they were separate so the master keys in
a women's accuse they don't made you
feel so I've just had ten minutes on my
own in the sauna not the sauna jacuzzi
house in the jacuzzi and I was lying and
it was all super lovely and everything
and relaxing but I just can't relax in
those situations I'm just too busy
thinking okay I'm gonna do but my next
blog posts what I'm gonna write for this
one we're gonna do for this nice it's
just taking up time that I don't have
right now so that's couldn't relax at
all so instead I've come back now I've
got a couple of hours hopefully to do a
bit of work anyway back to the vlog
we're a bit short on time so we ordered
to the room and how wonderful is this
how romantic
like I feel like I'm in my own
restaurant right now alex has a wacky
beef with rice and broccoli which is
actually - don't be here I love
broccoli you just cuz you're gonna be
over bro you know then greens no I'm not
and I got lucky which looks incredible
with spinach and gorgonzola mmm and also
bread and what man juice
cuz I love it and this is our view isn't
it gorgeous what a view to eat -
menu I come here
how crazy was that babe
pretty crazy
hey guys watch the back now from the
party I thought I just quickly start to
say good night quickly in apartment was
amazed and actually I really really
liked amazing vibe and the atmosphere
was really great and just the whole
thing was a little bit like overwhelming
to be honest because I mean I've been to
a lot of events as well but never really
is kind of a special guest or a VIP and
I've got kind of shown where to go and
I'll soak up film any of this I wish I
could have talks it's all very kind of
chaotic and and crazy and I've got taken
to a big press pit and I want to take my
picture and then I somehow lost Alex
because it's just so crazy and I've been
taking like a VIP bit to sit down and
get a drink because it's like oh my god
it's happened but it was absolutely
amazing
really really good fun and yes it's a
really crazy experience it was amazing
so after that we just sort of stayed
around in that area had a few champagnes
and chatted with a few people but sort
of see any more pictures from that or
anything on what I was wearing then just
go to my blog in the fro calm and it's
got loads of stuff on there yeah so good
night for now I will see you in the
morning overnight looks like the mist
its rolled in the game it's a shame but
least you got to see it a little bit
yesterday today is the day we go home
we're about to be down for breakfast I'm
quite hungry actually I've had three
hours sleep
unfortunately because I was too busy
last night working on a few blog posts
and things today I can either bother
putting on any eye makeup come on take
off all my makeup on the plane and sleep
without having to have a fight with eye
makeup so that's why I'm like brows but
no thanks as well I'm just wearing a
super easy t-shirt as well the MCM
customised follow me
you should finalize from the blog post

some funky
okay where is breakfast where is
breakfast I'm guess we must go down to
the lobby
how gorgeous is this lounge for
breakfast
it's just wake not at all card it's
really about that we've only ever eaten
in the room we have to actually ask
another day where to have breakfast but
this looks so delicious

holiday what and you think about this to
light every single meal in this hotel I
wish to get this more in the UK it's so
delicious mustard start making a
fraction of my own I forgot to fill my
breakfast before I ate it

latte which looks delicious so wake me
