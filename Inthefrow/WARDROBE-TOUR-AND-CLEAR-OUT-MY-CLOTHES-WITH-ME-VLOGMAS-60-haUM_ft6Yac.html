late to an afternoon because we just
been doing some bits and bobs of work
today pretty much that's all not on my
agenda it's getting my wardrobe in order
because it's a bit everywhere I think
some things are extremely creepy I can't
even wear them some things are here
there and everywhere and I also want to
do it for clear out so I thought I can't
bring you on for these because I know
you guys like to see what I'm doing or
what I've got in there and also what I'm
clearing out so that I bring you along
first order of the day yeah we don't
have a realigning board you just have
one of these thing films I'm gonna pull
out some bits from my actual closet and
just have like a big ironing session and
I'm gonna sell my laptop watch some
videos while I do it just so I've got
things to where there's nothing worse
than when you want to go out quickly
you've got two minutes to get dressed
and then you can't wear things because
they're so super crease also I
absolutely adore this NPL jumper and
because I didn't really have time I
threw it in the wash and I shouldn't
have done because it's cashmere and it's
very small now I can just about get away
with it I think it's not it's not shrunk
too much but I'm gonna give it an iron
very soft iron just to see if it may be
stretched it out of there and makes it a
bit more wearable again but at this
point in time this is what my lock at
the state of this I thought now wardrobe
looks like making me feel so light on
edge so I'm gonna go through everything
pull loads out and just get it in order
ok it's about now later I'm still
ironing clothes I just have a few more
to get through to so I feel like I've
got lots of nice things ready an iron
decay so I wanna wear them and I am
going to watch first ooh I'm gonna watch
the Mitchell axe this Christmas song is
so good
ok boring check-in number three ironing
is done if I in like 12 things 13 things
