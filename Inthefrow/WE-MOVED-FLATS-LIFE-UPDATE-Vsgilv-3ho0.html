gas now hello guys and welcome back
oh hello this is the first time you have
seen me before so let's do a little
introduction down again so I'm Victoria
this is in the fro and this is my beauty
fashion lifestyle Travel Channel I guess
it is if everything over here but
welcome back guys and welcome to it
brands new settings scenario situation
this is my new filming location my brand
new flat I hopes a lot of you've been
following along with my vlogs I know
that so many of you have and thank you
so much for all like the well-wishes and
all of the lovely things film and if
you've been saying about moving and
hoping it's going to be that stress-free
I kind of wanted to come along and do a
bit of a live update video discs I
really like watching news anyways yeah
and this really comes as a second I'm
sitting and chatting with you guys and
I've got my water I was going to make a
coffee and that's why I already had one
coffee this morning so don't wanna be
like jittery and shaky so instead I've
got my favorite coffee mug just with
some water I kind of want to sort of
split this into kind of like sections so
I'll make sure I kind of get everything
and the first one I want to talk about
is awfully home and home life we finally
moved family flats
we are so happy I can't even explain
just how happy now that was a flat it
was great at first but we outgrow it
within a couple of months it was just
extremely nice very very loud it's on a
main road it's right opposite pub it was
on a street that was a through route for
police cars and certain fire engines and
ambulances so and we also lived opposite
across rose and on some cross roads if
it's like a blind cross road you can't
see either way where the traffic's
coming yeah police cars will ask just
put on the siren so they can nip
straight through without any kind of
stopping and starting so we would get a
lot of sirens it would be just like 20
seconds long and then they split them
off and carry on with a day it just got
very very frustrating so bear that in
mind if you are hunting in any cities I
have just risked in fact no more okay
I'm actually filming this a few hours
ahead of us
putting yourself like it's very very
very quick enough to mark tomorrow
morning on in the fro calm I'm putting
up a blog post all about top tips for
city center flat hunting so if you're
looking at the moment in Manchester
Birmingham London is like anywhere in
the whole world and you're looking for
city centre apartment it's got loads of
tips on there and I've even correct like
a checklist page that you can print out
take with you and then take off as you
go so hopefully that really helps a lot
of you that look tomorrow so we learnt a
lot from that old flat anyway this a new
place that we've got it is wonderful
it's just so much bigger
I can't believe now we managed to spend
so much time that will slightly just
feel so much bigger so it's roomier it
feels like a little home like the other
place felt like a studio flat this feels
like an apartment you know like it has
like real lovely rooms and much more
homely like cozy vibe to it I've bought
a lot of furniture I've got a lot of
like ornaments and decorations for it
just to make it feel really lovely and
homely and I will be doing like an
office tour soon I'll be doing a closet
tour hopefully you guys miss that
Instagram in fact if you're going to
Instagram on my Instagram stories now
just at in the fro there's a few sneak
peeks of my closet and my office so you
can have a little kinky peek of those
familia especially in the manana keeps
texting me like sick oh my god you're
going office your new closet and it's
really nice from not showing anybody
else anything it's all just thing that's
why I've barely been on Twitter this
week available on Instagram I've not
been blogging that's which has been
trying to get the place looking goes
cleaning sorting things organizing so
it's been a bit of a week off work I
didn't really want to take off but I had
to but it it's good its kind of
rejuvenated I've got a new space it's
like a new start
so really really excited so we'll be
doing like the tours and holes really
really soon I just kind of want to get
the final pieces so still being made for
me right now but again a lot of things
that I have already bought I made a blog
post about so again I'll link it on the
screen it's a blog post about lots of
different places I've been buying from
and writebol so if you're interested
then going on
so now it's only through me talking to
you guys now like this that I'm
realizing how much my kind of speech has
come back a little bit I have just had
my bottom brace removed so a lot of you
guys will know I've had lingual braces
for the past 18 19 or so months no 20
months now
they are train tracks just on the back
of the teeth are called lingual braces
and I went to London lingual
orthodontics linic it's just on one Paul
Street in Marylebone amazing clinic if
you are an adult or young person who
really wants braces but you don't want
to have the braces on the very front of
your teeth for aesthetic reasons or if
you like me and you've already had them
on the front of you teachers years ago
what you do want to have that again then
honestly lingual braces are amazing I
honestly would HIGHLY highly recommend
them to my teeth now compared to what
they were is just phenomenally
phenomenally phenomenally different
we'll do a blog post so food on it
because my orthodontist he has lots of
pictures of what they look like then and
now and the difference in like the way
my teeth locking my guns especially no
way to sit together is huge so huge so I
really want to sort of share those
because it's amazing things that dental
work can actually do for you so I feel
so much more confident now as I can
smile properly so my face shape is
different completely different now and
then bulking back it at videos from
before I started getting done so I
started getting the braces in January
2016
so anything before then my face shape is
to a different it almost like pops it
out a bit because my jaw just look
different so honestly I am so pleased so
fine it has got the very bottom brace
off so I feel like my list that I did
have I mean I'll always have probably a
little list because I always have but it
was definitely sort of hiding a little
bit during the treatment as it would be
she's got metal in your mouth you just
feel so amazing and honestly I can't
tell you how thrilled I am with how it
looks it's very different to Invisalign
and then I get a few people asking is it
safe if in this line completely
different Invisalign you put in and out
like
Tanner's a lot of people find we don't
put them in all the time and then it
takes longer to do the reason I went for
lingual braces is because it's
constantly in your mouth always at work
you can't take them out so some that
will be a bad thing for me that was kind
of what I wanted the most I want them
just to be in and working non-stop so
that I could kind of get the treatment
done quicker and get everything over
with
snarf sergeant really liked the idea of
always having retainers in my mouth all
the time yeah
that's why I thought and I'm so happy
leaving God Oh actually what happen as
she was going back to the health think a
lot of people also asked why don't you
buy a house why haven't you bought a
house yet why'd you keep renting you
know it all comes down to different
people circumstances and situations I
think and I think it's quite a difficult
question to answer and also a slightly
almost slightly inappropriate question
to ask and must admit people are
different situations some people cannot
afford to buy some people prefer not to
and we want to live in London so far
over two years and a half and you know
I'm still in the middle of my career
I've still got a lot of stuff that I
want to do I need to be in the center of
London buying a house in centre of
London is going to set you back a couple
of million a million at least for a
really really big place especially want
to sort of stay in the center if I could
move south I couldn't ask and it would
be a little cheaper than that so cheaper
say a little less expensive now but the
moment a really enjoying being really
central I can get taxes anywhere within
15 minutes to half an hour I can get
tubes it's just for me right now that is
a situation I want to be in it just
quickly gets an amateur's quickly get to
meetings and that's what I want to do in
a few years time we are definitely move
further out maybe North London because I
mean my family are all north so what an
easy quick route from the m6 for them to
come and visit I don't want to be south
because that means it has to come
through London to get to me and you know
you never know in fact when I have kids
maybe five years time then I want it to
be easy for my parents come down and see
me so that's when we're gonna start
looking at buying houses right now it's
just not the right time for us yeah not
to sweat it but very very happy in this
new flat I feel like we've already kind
of made it
home another I can't keep the smiles on
face and if we talk about the sight I'm
so so happy so cat which to my closet
