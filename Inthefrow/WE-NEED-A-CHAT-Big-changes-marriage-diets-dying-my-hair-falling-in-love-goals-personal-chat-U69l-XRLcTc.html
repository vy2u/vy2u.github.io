more personal kind of video I realize
I've been on YouTube now for like three
years and never really just kind of
chatted not about clothes or about shoes
and bags and beauty and all of that that
I really obviously love I've never
really kind of have had a bit of a
personal heart-to-heart with you and I
figure it's about time I just really
wanted to kind of chat and a face to
face with you guys just about everything
and going on and life and goal to 2017
and all of that kind of good stuff
I kind of thought I've split this video
into three different parts love life
style and beauty those kind of love is
like to coin those four different things
first off love I think last year the
perfect four months of that year I
really became a very very different
person I think I became much more
chilled and relaxed and alleviated a
little bit of the stress that I was
feeling so I could organize things a
little bit more and for organize things
differently and through that became much
less stressed and I almost kind of
opened up a little bit and through that
I feel like I almost became a bit more
one with my emotions and how I felt
about different things and especially
about Alex because also mean Alex has
been to go now for years and years when
we had we had a little break in the
middle but majority for a long time and
obviously I'm head over heels in love
Alex I always have been but there was
always this kind of stress levels that
sometimes I would prefer to be working
rather them chilling and cuddling and
all that that you need to do in a
relationship and sometimes I prioritize
completely incorrectly and finally got
to the point a few months ago where it
almost kind of switched something our
brains completely switch and I realized
that I I think kind of neglecting this
part of my life I really need to like I
mean thank God Alex took this movie for
so long which is amazing ya feel like I
can neglected these emotions and the
perfume of it in so far
kind of come flooding in it's almost
like a clouds listed from park my brain
that would allow me to be a bit more
intimate in a full of emotion and now
we're like better than ever
oh I'm just so head over heels in love
I'm so so happy I mean if you thought I
meant with people I see a lot of my
tweets recently being like I'm so
smitten and blah blah blah because it's
robin else happened to me I've become
this really smelly birds and I never
used to be like before so I've got the
point as well now we're married
potentially on the cars like I'm
twenty-eight year thanking about
marriage is pretty exciting we had a
look at rings in the day when how
exciting is looking for wedding rings
and it really realized before because I
was never an up-bow about marriage I
think my parents are separated I wasn't
all that interested in the idea of
marriage until until recently when I
sort of felt in much more of these
emotions and now I just
yeah I'm really kind of what for the
idea of spending my life is Alex and
getting married and doing all that kind
of Princess Fairy stuff I mean I don't
know what kind of wedding at how I don't
really know I always kind of thought it
to be a girly WebP availeth and have
this really fun wedding with all the
family but not too sure now I'm not too
sure but we definitely picked the ring
it's absolutely beautiful so maybe
sometime this year it may be a wedding
on the car a week and also I think
combined in a love section of this video
would also be can friendships only make
some incredible incredible and
solidifies some incredible friendships
last year I feel especially with a
couple girls really close to me which
I'm sure you're in out really well
specifically to shout out to Carly
tomorrow
Suzy and Amelia and Sammy and Naomi who
are all kinda feel quite big part of my
life last year what a holidays we went
on trips became such good friends and I
salute I can't tell you how much it
means to have a group of kind of
trustworthy loyal amazing supportive
friends like that will always have you
back and everything and I'll give you a
real opinion on the things that you may
need like a brutal opinion on and
they've really made last year what it
was for me and I feel like this year and
like me and better we're already
planning new trips to go on together
we're all going to Amelia's house on
Tuesday she's cooking it's just it's the
best thing about my
career is the people I've met in it that
is amazing and obviously got a lot of
friends back home and old friends who I
feel like we became even closer last
year and this is a bit of noise up here
so let's chat about life and there's a
few singles combined in this section for
things such that I remembered this one
being home and yes me arts news last
April to my favorite area of London and
we're just so much happy now I feel so
much more secure and ease in this area
it's much more vibrant so much more
going on and I feel a lot more like a
part of this city than I ever really did
before it's definitely kind of changed
how I feel about London I mean I always
loved London but before we were look
further out and it just wasn't even hub
London vibes at all we all kind of swap
the too far out who couldn't enjoy this
amazing city the way it should be
so now yeah so much better I mean
obviously the area that we're living in
now is what there's more expensive if
you're from London you'll know how
ridiculous the prices are and so our
flat we love our flat but it is somewhat
small for how much stuff we have this is
one thing I hate about it now literally
every few minutes I'd say every 10
minutes to the siren and it goes on till
the early hours that is the one downfall
what other than that I love it I really
do love it here so I'm so happy oh yeah
when I'm going to talk about diet and
health as well and I'm so sorry diet but
think of change in terms of what I'm
eating these days that I mentioned so
I'm now more plant-based I decided to go
out dairy I was achieved theme some of
you may know I love cheese
I ate so much of it and I realize that I
wanted to kind of just tone up a little
bit more I mean I know I'm very slender
I'm very slim I don't need to lose
weight in the sciences but I wanted to
kind of tone up a little bit that I just
felt a little bit self-conscious off and
I felt that cheese could be a good way
of going about that in terms getting rid
of dairy altogether so I've covered area
not really eating eggs I don't eat meat
all of last year which I really quite
enjoy if I'm not doing that anymore so
much are plant-based now I'm really
enjoying it and I know that I mentioned
it in a recent video so many of you were
so supportive and like yes sir please
eat giant blood-based honestly I'm
loving it we are making so many
delicious meals I never know how easy it
would be to go plant-based because we'd
already substituted a lot of the big
things that you have in life anyway in
our diet so for example like milk could
already been drinking
almond milk for years we'd already been
having almond butters not muscles for
years
so like butcher and milk causes it's
partly a tray of eggs maybe bit more so
I also get them to fish sauce
pescetarian last year so silly in fish
so I've kind of given up fish with it
but I may potentially go back to fish
I'm not sure yet but yeah plant-based
I'm really enjoying it I feel much less
lethargic I feel and kind of feel like
I'm kind of on my game and that I can
reach my goals a little faster this way
start for everyone everyone needs to
kind of build a diet according to what a
food diet is in your eating plan so
people just need to build that you can
plant according to what they really want
to eat and what they feel is good for
their bodies this would work for
everyone but it's really working for me
and along those lines and also trying to
really get on the tune again and really
go to yoga every once every week if not
every two weeks and it's something
really when I can go and when the
classes are but expensive a time for
Rihanna and y'all really enjoying that
again and just going to the gym it's a
feeling I can working my body a little
bit more than just sitting on my ass all
day and also within life again is career
and yeah I couldn't be happier nice I
also love what I do
of the anime primarily a full-time
fashion blogger why also create videos
which I live I would always research
myself as a blogger certain solvents in
honesty and found into the grammar are
the stuff and I really enjoy it and the
supportive feedback that I get every day
makes it really worthwhile and I love
seeing your comments and hearing some
people and hear about different things
that have helped people
or inside them some way like that this
makes it all so much more worth it I
mean obviously there's been a few
different changes in terms of you
YouTube's algorithms and algorithms and
that can be a little disheartening I
think for all of us is all felt it but I
feel like if you have an audience I'm a
viewer or as someone who likes to read
blog posts or in watches watch a watch
video is all in scam post it's just
about engagement I think this is the
kind of I think 2017 is the year of
engagement and if you want to see more
of your favorite people is just about
engaging with them and liking what
they're doing especially like with
Instagram this whole algorithm change
means that say if you saw me in your
feed and you didn't like my picture the
chances are that you won't see my next
picture etcetera etcetera it kind of
works in that format if you like my
picture that's how you'll see my next
picture and my next picture and that's
kind of way it works I feel that
especially last year it was kind of the
year for scrolling and I mean I used to
be quite bad fit to just scroll Scroll
scroll and to see what everyone's doing
and I remember I turned it around and
right now I'm going to start properly
liking everything that I really like to
give someone that kind just shows in my
appreciation to the work they're doing
so that out that they're wearing for the
travel picture that still technically
took then I should get put up a mountain
to take you know my feed now is for so
many incredible pictures and people
whose work is really inspiring and
amazing and I think that's more of what
when you do small kind of show
appreciation show engagement especially
on Instagram kind of like more of people
pictures if you two are a flogger and
you notice your lights have gone down
the chances are it's because no one
seeing our pictures as much and it's
just about your audience into liking
your pictures in order to see your next
picture or you're not going to be seen
which is a shame and this is where the
Instagram has gone but but still
absolutely loving what I'm doing and
engagement is always amazing and you
guys are always supportive and
respectful and all that sense thank you
as always this year for me it's just
going to be more of the same in terms of
videos and blog post if anything else I
made quality higher and higher bring you
things that you really love watching I'm
in love reading so kind of more the same
what even is better is kind of my aim I
will do lots of travel again if you
accept you like the content is prettier
and a little bit more inspirational
still a bit more of them
and who knows maybe some morning
ventures could be on horizon hopefully
with a lot of incredible brands gonna
see a meal uh she was insane in terms of
the brands away with I work with Galan
do your Armani and with I can't remember
so many Ted Baker tree Oh coach there
were a ridiculous amount of a million
grants that where is and hopefully that
will continue this year I can spring you
more and more exciting content to be and
also within this kind of wife category
is also more personal feelings and
thoughts I mean I know I mentioned
before about love and the whole white
left stress opening myself up a little
bit more and allow my stuff to be a
little bit more vulnerable and all that
but I feel also left you really kind of
raised my confidence a lot as well and
made me a lot more of a stronger person
and more business-minded which i think
is amazing and I know that I love to
write my blog about more personal
aspects of life like about sub
confidence and self-worth and growth and
all of those topics now I really like to
write about those sort of things I've
never really transferred that into a
more video format so if you like to see
more of that and let me know in the
comments but yeah I feel like my sock
officers really moved a lot last year in
terms of I did a lot of talks I did a
lot of meet great so I met a lot of you
guys I work a lot of different brands
and all those things and all those trips
and travels and meeting different people
constantly really pushes you out your
comfort zone and throws you into new
situations that you would never have
been in before and it's really nice to
see how you react to those things and
how how it challenges you to person and
it just yeah it is bound to raise your
self confidence and self esteem and self
awareness and I feel that was a great
learning curve for me last year and I
learned a lot from it and learn a lot
from the people that I met and I feel
like a much stronger person now a lot
more kind of focused a lot more
confidence which is amazing yeah I mean
I'd love to do this or Vidya I'm kind of
self confidence from where I got my
confidence from cuz I never used to be
that confident when I was a lot younger
then you have to check on that and be
good to kind of get a bit of this
discussion going next one is style
I wonder what style so again last year
was kind of a big transition for me in
terms of style in fact also 2015 as you
know I love a wide range of runs from
low end high end my favorite if you saw
my last video you'll know that
favorite type of brands are those very
mid market brands like Joseph riess
whistle All Saints now I feel it's kind
of like high quality wonderful clothing
for that unique edge that makes them a
little bit more special in your wardrobe
and you can wear them with anything but
I also love my office Topshop I love a
sought-after now I'm coming to a saw
Hall Queen but then I also thoroughly
enjoy my luxury bags and watch your
shoes which obviously F save just a lot
of thought over the years and I
collectively is blowing out a lot of you
guys love actually signed you love that
kind of aspirational inspirational style
of video which is making good idea of
the kind of videos are in like watching
too but this year I also want to make
sure that I do include a lot more high
street and upper end High Street and
lower end high street and make sure that
no one feels alienated you see I find it
quite difficult because there's over 538
very often the fewer thing now blows my
mind so it blows my mind
and I think I'll mark you are very very
different which is wonderful and I love
that guy versus getting it's incredible
but I think a lot of you like Beauty
there are a lot of you like fashion so
if you like low end fashions and if you
like middle end fashion and so if you
like luxury fashion then as those of you
look like Charles Locke or all of the
views that prefer the more London vlog a
lot of you like different things on my
channel and a lot of you like the same
things to is great but I feel that there
is almost this kind of separation
somewhere which means I don't want to
alienate anyone make anyone feel like
all Victoria doesn't make the kind of
thing I'd like to watch anymore or I
don't enjoy it Tory does I make sure
that I give you something that you
really really enjoy I want to make sure
that happens if you so I guess this is
kind of my way of telling you that I'm
going to try to make sure I do a lot of
everything this year there might be a
few travel vlogs thrown in there may be
a few londonlove thrown in vlogs thrown
in and there'll be a big mix of
different types of fashion different
types of style I want to also have a
more kind of helpful take this year as
well it's really kind of give you
something from it more than just holes
and what you could wear but just a
little bit more educational feel to I
guess because I'm sure
that's nothing I guess yeah I'll make
things I really enjoy sure to make
things are really enjoy and hopefully
you guys will enjoy an antic winter my
personal style it isn't really good
change very much I like trends and I
like to move the trends and incorporate
as much as I can but I still and that
sort of person who loved tailoring I
love my knitwear this is brandy
absolutely obsessing it and I'd love my
jeans and food I mean what girls would
love a white shirt blue jeans and make a
pair of boots
that's me a little bit I'm going to
change that but I've always been
cooperating your books your pieces
alongside Midland and lo n High Street
and hopefully you guys really enjoy
yourselves and last one I guess is
beauty and I don't know maybe some
change this unit and prepare like I'm
really enjoying still having white hair
a lot of you probably join us channel
back when I had pink and purple hair
naps in love that it was good for
experimenting and just being a bit more
vibrant and sharing my personality
through my hair style but then I went
white and really really loved just
having something quite stark and a
little bit different there are many
people that have this white gray hair
mainly because it breaks your hair like
anything but I think because I'm quite a
dark blonde now it doesn't need the mass
amount of lift it would take if I was a
brunette or if I had like hair so that's
why I luckily my hair is still somewhat
attached to my scalp and it's continuing
to grow with sweat like slowly
so yeah I'm quite enjoying it but you
never know especially with my L'Oreal
hair ambassadorship which I got leftist
insane
taste wait there may be some colors on
the way so it does know maybe have to
keep an eye out but exciting really
exciting and in terms of kind of makeup
and beauty in all that I used to love
doing a lot of makeup tutorials on this
channel but I feel not as many of you
are as interested in makeup tutorials
and more am i right am I not when you
feed me feedback down below I'd love to
hear what you think about that I mean I
still love doing my favorites every
month because I like to recommend
different products that tried and that I
think you guys will love too
but in terms of get rid of his knees and
beauty tutorials I would just love to
hear your feedback in terms of are you
still enjoying that I mean obviously
four years ago people lack those ups but
you still want to see them just wanna
see that some major ASIMO's
and content and see more of a fashion
makes a beauty content I'd love to know
what you think about it now I really
love doing makeup tutorials but I feel
that you guys aren't as interested in my
video tutorials as maybe you are in my
fashion styles and videos so I love that
feedback I almost kind of want to be in
a room with loads of you and just like
shout about it discuss it get like
questions and just get get everything
all the knowledge get all the knowledge
that I need but this season for me I
mean I still about this nude lip in fact
it's right here this is insane at the
bare minerals matte lips and almost got
a frosted glass coating this is what I'm
wearing melet's today it's called smooch
smooch and it's the map amazing it's a
very light pink almost lilac tone to it
and I'm obsessed so I'm still rocking
the matte lip this year matte pink a new
lip is still my thing I'm gonna try to
experiment morning throwing some more
red lips and again yes yes you seem more
experimental overall but I'm also really
enjoying having nothing on my lower
lashes as well just to open up my eyes a
little bit more meet them less kind of
you know extra black makes much smaller
since I open my eyes a little bit more
and this is a highlighter I'm obsessive
putting highlighters on my eyelids right
now just everything just shines and I
like shiny so I think that might be
everything that sounds like a big update
on everything that's going on what I'm
thinking about what I thought our house
channel hopes will progress over the
next year yeah so I hope you enjoyed it
I've kind of enjoyed getting it off my
chest to be honest sometimes I hope
you've enjoyed the thing to this ramble
