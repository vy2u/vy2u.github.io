I know yeah stroller frolicking who's
gonna spend a bit of time doing a little
bit of work so this vlog is actually in
partnership with Google I mean answer
huge front of that pixel book lose every
night to watch on Netflix shows on the
computer has a whole host of apps on it
everything is kind of included on the
laptop I've logged into my Google
accounts got on my usual kind of Google
Chrome apps and bookmarks everything so
I can just work on this as normal well
the cool thing about it it's like how
thin it is
it's absolutely teeny-weeny and it's
really really lightweight so it's
perfect for like on the go so we always
bring it on our trips with us watches at
night either just in laptop mode or you
can flick it around and - tablet mode
which is cool or depending on how you're
lying in bed
we often have it just propped up like
this in tent mode or you can have it
like use entertainment mode as well so
however you want to use it so it
literally it's so perfect just of - I'm
just gonna work on it a little bit now
I'm gonna add a little bit of blog stuff
- a little bit of writing it's just
super handy and we'd like 15 minutes
charge you can see like 2 hours of
battery life the battery life is amazing
on it so sitting out here busy breezy
it's lunchtime and we've gone straight
in for the Maldivian fish curry which is
our absolute favorite we literally love
it I've got Papa John's I've got pickle
we've got everything and we have this
for you we were so tired I like do just
fall asleep them gorgeous meal
apparently they've had this organic
restaurant will you go along and
everyone pick their own homes they're in
their own vegetables and they get cooked
in front of you so now we're just in the
organic garden up here I mean this is
beautiful up here you can have like
private dining if you want to so I've
got this gorgeous garden all of its
organic 70 percent of this is used in
the main kitchen for food so we're all
sitting together got a little group of
us and they're gonna cook all of the
herbs the vegetables here for us for a
gorgeous meal what vegetables are you
gonna get babe garlic chives sounds
pretty nice arugula is my favorite this
is the Coolsville yeah how lovely
Thank You Steph it's a tight battle to
me mint over there I feel like things
are biting my face yeah you brighten
summer color this is the salad that we
picked I hope it's good I did to kind of
put around a mix in into the filler and
a dispense
last half an hour just unpacking
everything just so I can see where
everything is this is my kind of color
scheme for this trip I feel like my last
trip had much more of a cool scheme I've
got Reds I've got greens I've got quite
a bit of yellow and blue and white
especially that's definitely the kind of
key theme I think and I have how many oh
my gosh that many bikinis with me I
think it's about 14 maybe about 12 12
but you you've got a couple of bags and
she's barely any though kids don't need
to wear any shoes I've just got on my
makeup off and my skincare on face is
all flowing up again because the
solution don't just go down it just it's
almost like it's reacting and
exfoliating yes so I'm gonna go get in
bed
good morning guys wake me up - this
video is absolutely wonderful
Alex I've been out for a little while
but I could not wake up this morning
with the jetlag however my hair is super
crazy now I need to go have a shower and
it's also it's kind of like I mean the
breeze is beautiful
it looks like it's gonna get really
really lovely soon it's just a bit gray
it's got a really nice feel this morning
I have a good feeling about it
not sure how well he can hear us
Lynch with Alex and Vic I should do this
in my vlogs yeah I fill in it this looks
delicious we're having Tuna Nicoise
salad that's awesome I've got coconut
water mango juice obsessed this it's
just like coconut this is a creme brulee
made with coconut milk so how is your
first holiday and five years ago actual
real holiday oh it's just beat the most
beautiful place I'm really loving it the
whole vibe is they don't feel like we've
scratched the surface of it yet though
well no it's what any second day and we
didn't really get to do anything yes
take just nap but for like 90 minutes I
felt I could slept like seven hours off
about so good okay I didn't know we had
a bit of a nap then we went for an
amazing dinner as you saw today or we
had a spa treatment hmm oh wow so good I
always go for it like super deep to the
point where it hurts that much thicker I
start rolling to the back of your head
but when you leave later on your body
just feels completely brand new again I
had some time on the beach look how
amazing this area is it's so beautiful
there so I'm not seen anything like this
actually in a Maldivian resort this big
spit of lamb and these beautiful like
sporadic trees but this is again I'm a
bit of a different view so our our place
over there that's a massive private one
slide got everything yeah I mean all of
these here you could get boats too
alex is about to climb this tree over
here yeah again so I did it once I took
some great pigs and now I decided that
we want to change lenses it's going to
cut his body open twice what's painful a
bit we now have the ghillie chasing
experience to go on I think now idea is
that you go around a few of the
different restaurants and have a little
taste of their cuisine with wine which
sounds pretty great
now it's next on the agenda I still not
wash my hair yeah I'm still quite
enjoying this color so I'm trying to
keep it for as long as possible
also this highlight I'm living for this
right now
there's a nest a larger one like the
bronze goddess ones in the gold oh my
gosh literally look at this it's this
place even real I'll let you have goose
bumps just look at this place it's
absolute beautiful I sorry about my
little red face we have had the best
night again it was me and Alex with
jasmine Helmsley and her fiance Nick
again would have happened to both
becomes his Gilly tasting experience and
we literally just walked around a few
little spots on the island drinking sake
we had champagne we had wine and then we
had cocktails so it was a really lovely
a little kind of like walking tour with
food and drink and we just were just
getting to know Jasmin and Nick and
they're literally blowing our mind with
everything they know about mindfulness
and meditation and wellness and them
just absolutely amazed it so I mean ants
all night it's been like tell us more
this is yeah anyway I am gonna take my
red face away exfoliate yeah head to bed
I will see in the morning
oh my gosh
good morning wow what a morning
ah that is roasting Oh happiness
happiness happiness this looks
absolutely beautiful I waited a finish
different and get thee well Vivian
omelette oh I suppose through the
Maldivian peak so the Maldivian Coryell
I live in everything else
Maldivian everything is the best thing
but gems and milks cereals and hot food
no morning
more hot Wow we lose hash browns and
they've got bread and pastries mmm I've
got some sweet stuff yum yum yum yum yum
so alex is gonna go on to the villa to
fight the monster the huge fish and
leave here I think it's a porcupine fish
or something but it's really massive
Alex wants to go and try and find it now
it's swimming away oh no he's not gonna
be happy when he's just kind of floating
away on the breeze here it is nice
braver than me definitely would not want
to be underneath the villa under the
water freaks me out
I'm gonna do some work now alex has just
gone snorkeling
you've gone to wampum Island so I've got
myself a little set up outside and I'm
gonna do a little bit of work
I've just arrived up one Palm Island and
this is going to be the best place to
snorkel there's two Palm Island and I
think over there if you can see it
there's a three farm somewhere else but
this is going to be the best place to
see all the fish
you might remember me mentioning in a
previous vlog I am now a contributing
fashion columnist for Glamour magazine

almost like how you can get the looks
now off of the catwalks that sort of
thing this is the Google pen they can
get with the Google pixel clock this is
so handy it forgot the Google assistant
on it so for example here it says 3.1
Phillip Lim safe I'm not heard anything
about 3.1 Phillip limit for I'm gonna
hear about more of it I can just ring
his name pull this up whoo this is not a
look for it and then it just tells me a
little bit more info so here it's the
website and then I can just click

spot now we're gonna go along to the net
it's actually in the next villa which is
super handy
Jasmin's sound bath this sessions really
looking forward to this kind of got a
little bit inkling of what might happen
but I'm trying to be really open-minded
with it just see what happens I'm really
looking forward to it so it's Alex yeah
it's gonna head long today now so this
is the ocean one this is the one I was
playing with the ocean drum which was
the sound of the ocean
so you just kind of filled up a sound
like this Wow as soon as it starts to
really vibrate you're pushing it too
hard oh really
yeah but if you play it with another
ball they kind of build on each other so
you can build this one oh my gosh and
you've not even touched it time to do it
so depending on the effect you want some
kind of do binaural beats together so
they think wow wow yeah I love that yeah
could really get a feel if I break
through and you almost can't think
during that time so for example I've got
this one is this Asia
they shot me
Wow
yeah they sent over every page that kind
of never changed

most incredible sunset in fact it was
beautiful sunset I mean it's gone down a

British Airways delayed our flight by a
day full day which is not handy at all
because I've got a lot I've got things

however because of the fact that it was
delayed a full day we've had to now book
new flights we've had to get onto an
Emirates flight for tonight which gets
us in on a night flight at 7:55 tomorrow
morning so that's what we're doing which
means we have a full day here again
which swings and roundabouts there are
worse places to be in the world if you
are delayed so one's gonna try and enjoy
the day we've got a few little bits of
work to do because technically not
holiday really we're meant to be back to
