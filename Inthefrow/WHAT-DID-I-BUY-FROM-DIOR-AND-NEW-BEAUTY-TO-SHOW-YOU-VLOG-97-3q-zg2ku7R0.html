mother out stuff so you should always go
to benefit chemistry and I know from
previous experiences that it usually
like grab some to my skin around the
edges but today really really really
talk I mean they actually look okay now
I quite like the dark color I was just
freaking out because they were Asian
actually like my foundations that glow
everything and now this is I'm raw skin
could Oh Tex Alex the way home is like

now now I've scrubbed it them with some
with just like a flannel and some
shampoo it's actually come off thank
goodness and actually how much it like
the cutting them up for em Oh panic mode

literally right opposite but you're in
the juice and before I went in in to
benefit I was like oh my god I'm gonna
go join the juice when I come out it's
gonna be delicious I'm gonna make the
day amazing and then lecture as I left I
had to skip straighten a cow because I
thought I can't be seen with you around
and they were literally massive just
taking completely to the skin but it's
all good now guys it's all good now
these actually I really like how dark
they are I think it's just I don't know
my skin every time I go my skin just
takes a die and clings to it
I mean I've I've had it before I've done
the day before I think I'm done
don't do that I mean they tell you not
to do it and I just didn't read that
fine print but then it sticks so bad and
it does not come off there

so I advise let's go for a little walk
so we're literally gonna walk it to the
shop and go to Pratt and get some bits
for dinner aren't we but at least we're
getting out the house man
morning guy Tuesday another glorious day
yeah I keep saying that I'm gonna really
really good mood today we've just had a
bo shake I am around Newt and I put on a
full body of the Vita Liberata invisi
firm again I go for medium dark thank
you all for your amazing comments by the
way on the insert video that mean Alex
created for that I'm a huge huge fan of
Vita browser so the fact that I get to
work with them recently and I've worked
about a few different projects recently
it's been like a dream because there's
my favorite favorite brand so we put
together this in Seville in st. Lucia
showing can I use a tan and it was
completely like filmed to the time as
well like I put it on like I did in the
video I did go to sleep in it and then I
wake up and that's when we filmed again
so it's completely realistic to what
actually happened so just find a new
coat if this looks lovely lovely attend
I did my hair last night I put loads
toner on it I still use the Loreal Pro
silver shampoo toner like a little
silver bottle it's the best it's the
only one I use I get so many people
asking me why I still use it's only over
that I'll quickly run through what I do
though shampoo your hair first rinse out
and then really dry off the hair so it's
just sort of it's not
like shopping then have loads of the
purple shampoo and literally coat your
hair in it something hair is that you're
not sure pulley leave it 5 minutes or
more maybe test this out first I mean my
hair reacts really well but don't want
you to come back to me like my hair went
purple maybe test out with 3 minutes I
do it for 5 minutes sometimes even more
than that sometimes until I can almost
feel my scalp being a little bit tiny
bit tingly and then I take it off and
then I know the next day it's gonna look
like this that's what I know so did my
hair did my tan got my brows done
yesterday which I'm actually really
quite like you know and then later but
in a couple of hours I'm gone getting my
lashes done I'm going getting my lashes
lvl and if they can fit me and I officer
let me get them and I also want to get
the SPS lashes if they can fit me in as
well which is say amazing super quick
falsies so things grass I forgot I'd not
shown you why I picked up the date do so
as well as my book duct which I've had a
few people message me they are so rare
now if you want mommy you really need to
kind of put your name down
ASAP for it I bought a couple of rings
I've had my eyes on these before how
long have I wanted this ring for babe no
absolutely love it and every time I
tried on it was always too big for me
but then I tried it on again the other
day and it was just it was fit it fit
really well since I'm okay I decided to
get it thing of this actual ring fit me
all the rest of you so like slide off me
I don't know why so
isn't it pretty oh it's really pretty
and mean I like this particular because
it's got the bee on it and for all
valves that symbolize it's not Chester
and the Manchester be so big big fan and
then I also I also saw this of the day
and I have so little love this ring says
shoddy or in the very bronzy gold
everything right now it does come in a
set of two so it comes with this as well
which is Murano glass which they are
doing a lot of right now and it also has
a little CD dangling from it as well
really cute when it comes in a pair
which is really gorgeous you could wear
them stacked or the chances are I mean
to be honest I think most days I
probably too slow on
it's just so such a nice children but
this one I'll probably wear maybe on the
other hand it's just just quite a cute
little ring then because I have Cannes
Film Festival coming up this weekend I
needed a new pair of black heels to wear
you know it's like for us ladies when we
need our black heels and I realized I
haven't bought a pair of black heels in
about two-and-a-half three years like
like statement not like normal black
heels I like a statement Boudreaux like
a crazy stiletto but that's like a
normal statement Punk so when did your
dogs I managed to get these in stock in
my size
as well so I ended up getting these and
as you probably know I have the patent
beige once I bought them about a year
and a bit ago and they are my most worn
heels I have worn them for so many event
so many special occasions red carpets
different events holidays they aren't
all around milks wart on her shoes so I
thought I forget the black and no I'm
gonna get the wear out of them I mean
there were more money than I wanted to
spend that day but I decided that
especially if I cam coming out for the
film festival and for other events and
the fact they're a black shoe and it
without a doubt gonna get my absolute
money's worth out of these so I just
used some savings for these and decided
to take the plunge
but anyway anyway I need to need to make
myself some breakfast and get off to my
SPS appointment okay oh gosh I'm very
timely this like okay I'm ready to go
I'm gonna go good mesh is done they're
still really good for my LVL and they're
really up still it's sort of a great for
some extensions I am back from my lash
appointment it looks so good I love them
so much so now I don't have to do loads
of things to my lashes when I'm going on
my trips so I'm going away on Thursday
to Austria driving down to Venice and
then hopefully going straight from
Venice over to nice for Cannes Film
Festival until Monday so a few things
coming up and that's why I wanted to
have some lashes done so yeah these are
the SPF flashes from Nouveau lashes yeah
