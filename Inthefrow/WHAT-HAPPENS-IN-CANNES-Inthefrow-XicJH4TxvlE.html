continuation of the last vlog I want it
just put them up just so you can I get a
bit the feel of what we're getting up to
in these few days because it's quite
nice for kind of away doing some things
and fancy difference and vlogging so the
first vlog if you've not seen that I'll
leave a link down below that's kind of
what we did enough first day you can
with L'Oreal and this vlog is gonna be
all about the next two days of kind of
chill time down time at the TR at
Miramar Beach Resort and Spa so I was
with L'Oreal and then I'm going back on
the weekend to be with the Elie Saab
team so I had two days in between so I
thought well rather than going home and
coming back then we would have stayed in
the area or kind of nearby to come along
the coast I think to coat desert is
that's how you say it
two the tiara Miramar Hotel it's just
locked incredible so I really wanted to
stay here and have a look and see what
it's all about and it's just so
beautiful I don't really need to piss
relaxation time so this is gonna be so
perfect and here I've got the bathroom
this is super well it's a boat with our
Vista furnace well it's just really
gorgeous and then outside this is a view
outside of our room which is beautiful
I'm now gonna go get some lunch
Delabar and does everything that shows I
think I've picked a pretty down while
look at the colors I was going soup or
chicken for tuna
I came for a little walk and found this
really pretty marina so it's literally
about five minutes walk down from my
hotel it's really really cute just
wanted to get away and explore a little
bit oh and this is literally the nearest
thing that we could explore
so by the way how cute are these glasses
they're like ivory and I'm pretty sure
like 18 karat gold cute I'll leave the
link down below so we're eating our room
tonight we've just been working all day
and should I catch up with loads of work
so it was both been working in the room
does quite chilled and we thought we'd
order to the room so this is what we've
ordered everyone left a parmesan risotto
and life of a beer and we also have some
vegetable soups and we also have some
cheesecake on its way we ordered another
delicious breakfast to our unis morning
so feeling really cometh awake and ready
to start the day we're gonna go to the
gym just kind of get out of the way feel
more refreshed and I'm gonna head back
to the Martinez hotel
so we finished our work out for so much
but I did a little bit of yoga a little
bit of sort of spend time which is
really really nice do a few like don't
suppose as tree poses and I feel much
more kind of like scented which is great
and we're just packing up with practical
our bits and bobs and we're gonna get a
taxi mail back to the Martinez we've
made our way over to the Masters hotel
had a bit of luck we were on them
we got chauffeured over from the other
hotel to here and then I realized like
as we were nearly brought into the next
hotel that's what I'm a jacket so I've
gone and left my jacket in this
restaurant welcome Lee I think there go
another chauffeur coming this way again
soon who's gonna bring my jacket for me
but it's my file manager here it's not a
jacket I can lose and I also wear it
every single day and recently so I
literally like lose an hour but I think
it's ok I think we're gonna bring it so
did we have it I lacked a a really good
finality I love it when people Anila
the last thing on
chilling out and you're gonna check into
our room really soon
he's sweet but this is the most
incredible Ram look at this is you this
is seriously gold
everything is so beautiful chocolate Oh
baby
I've destroyed on my outfit to shoot I'm
absolutely a lot for that the colors are
so pretty is this looks more coral on
screen it's more of a kind of corally
pink tone and then it's really beautiful
text jumper but I really like the colors
I think the colors look really bright
and springy and I guess not what you
really expect myself so I really love
that about it
really beautiful I'm so glad I found
some town or else I would have looked
really ridiculous in this and beyond
we've just got back and le salad left us
some gifts Wow look what happens can
there's a hat oh wow it's in here Wow
they've give me one of the new rows
could show off sense which I've just
been taking some pictures with and it
smells so beautiful oh the sight is the
Rose Couture body lotion how beautiful
please Sam I love pink with a they know
me well I'm a big fan of pistachio and a
cutely mess how beautiful is so
wonderful thank you really far look at
this this is so beautiful big dream but
I also have this nice our dresses as
well as a second option which is also
really beautiful but I think maybe the
red carpet I may go with this one and
maybe get my hair done a little bit loss
of larger glam waves potentially it's a
little bit more glam yeah this is really
beautiful just finished having my hair
makeup done by Frank Provo who I think
is kind of like a French I was like a
beautician brand they'll help loads of
different celebs and bloggers and people
like me to get ready for big events so
they did my hair and leave us some
beautiful eye makeup on me an undersized
doing a bit of my own because you know
what I'm like and I've got my beautiful
dress on now my Elie Saab dress this is
my dress
I just wanted to go for a very kind of
Hollywood glam style with it that's why
I've gone for the very kind of Marilyn
Monroe's kind of hair
can actually see me yeah so it's a
different kind of look to what you
should go for but that's what I've
really enjoyed about last few hair cells
that I've had done because they're not
things I could ever do myself so it's
nice to kind of get them done for me
again I'm actually wearing the same
shall do to Rossi satin lawyer the day
but I decided with this dress here the
perfect choice for you they didn't want
to go for something what it matched
because I had already won them and I'm
going to pair it with my
I'm so sorry guys I completely forgot to
vlog anything on the red carpet in
honesty you're not allowed cameras like
this on there
you're allowed phones and it's such a
mad panic lets you get on that
everyone's just pushing you along and
like come on
no pictures like come on come on so
trying to get any footage is just
ridiculous but otherwise I just got to
the room alex is already here cuz Alex
couldn't come on the red carpet
listening unfortunately Elessar would
just sent me a gift to say thank you for
being here with them they've given me
this beautiful way you can't see in this
life it's like a rosy leather purse I
think it's leather beautiful Elie Saab
Paris this absolutely gorgeous gold
bracelet that is so me it's really
beautiful
I mean I know usually look for silver
but I just love the kind of chunky style
of this and how but she's that little
tassel so it's been fab and I can't wait
for tomorrow we're going over to the
scent honor are on a wrong Island a
little speedboat gonna go have lunch
there so I'm looking forward to that so
I'll catch you in the morning
morning guys it is our last day in camp
and we've been greeted by the most
insane breakfast
the amazing ladies from Elie Saab told
us to order some food to our room but we
didn't realize they were also ordering
through to my room and it's all
obviously centered around the whole Rose

this breakfast everything's pink pink
macarons pink hand cakes pink they just
different crepes and pancakes
I've got fruit we've got yogurt we've
got pink
I'm guessing this must be like milkshake
we've just got back actually from a
perfume almost like a perfume lesson all
about the La Salle fragrances
and let's try all the beautiful self
special collection collection dear assan
sir I think she said it much more
beautifully than I ever could but yeah
we got to try so many different
fragrances which were absolutely
beautiful and learn all about the
collections which is gorgeous but I also
think all my favorites has to just be
the new rose Quito it's just very very
me I think I'm going to make my summer
scent so we've spent a bit time in there
we also spent some time talking through
the fashion pieces and all about the
Elie Saab Hawkshaw and the register

those as well so it's just really
wonderful kind of being a mess in the
Elie Saab oiled it has been really
really wonderful and now I'm gonna head
