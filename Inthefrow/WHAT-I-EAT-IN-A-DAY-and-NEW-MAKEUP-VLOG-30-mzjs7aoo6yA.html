give it back and give back the keys and
all that so that was just a bitter laugh
and then we came back and then we made

that was kind of it didn't pick up my
camera again however we just woken up
today feeling much more productive today
and back into the whole vlogging thing

wall not too short maybe I've got a
little bit large in there maybe

thinking and this picture I have loved
this it's got real light Edward Hopper

beautiful teal color and the orange

combination I bought that recently I'll
leave a link down below where I got that
from and I've got this as well she got
from Oliver bonus last year yeah you

to everything the other day so I'm
hoping it won't stick check this out I'm
so pleased with it it looks so good
super productive workspace and I've kept
everything very very minimal on my desk

kugels daily reviving concentrate this

delightful fabulous okay let's go in
with they're such a DCL eye treatment
bugs age defying a therapy for eyes what
if this is a night one Mars and evenings
right a little bit
all you label in a nice way like not too
much feels really nice
oh no my battery's going great that
feels lovely
I really like that my site is not a
knight actually as well
okay keels data-binding concentrate I
love the night time the night of
covering so I thought I'd try the
daytime oil to just if you want that
really Julie looking skin
I'm sneaky foundation this will
absolutely help if you put oil
underneath so really odd radiance back
into the skin got too much there but
he'll not I don't really need a serum
but I really want to try this who your
customized oh so you turn this and it
gives you different doses so you can do
a little or large dose interesting
okay well skin is now positively radiant
that's nice feels nice feels nice
we should probably try that without oil
does certain kind of see what the
benefits are let's try this last is your
thumbs shoe rosy glow highlight okay I
think it's it's very wet very wet and
now that mask this is like a creamy pink
kind of cream so it gets really like
super radiant also hard to glow and you
can also add this over makeup like well
can you see how radiant Maginnis face
done they're all really really good
products actually nice new products and
this on she's very very cool I mean
it's a great time it was he cologne to
it it's really really nice
do you like my normal creams that I'll
be honest very impressed with this tcii
this great quite like the easing this I
mean they all look great
they're real great okay I can't a
foundation at the moment I'm really
enjoying using my Lancome custom made
foundation in the vlog a while back I
went into Lancome in Harrods and I had
like this is my own constant foundation
so they this a bit of my skin tone you
can choose if you want it by heavy
coverage medium coverage if you want it
darker like warmer or cooler and your
skin and so this is technically like my
perfect foundation now or it should be
and I've really been enjoying it
she right now I'm not only this works
really well I went for like a medium
style coverage for this let me show you
hopefully for my camera died so feels
quite lightweight as I find lots of
uncommon foundations do anyway okay
filming for neat a night obviously as I
was eventually my battery was about to
die
alright what happened since then got my
full face on
I feel under good times now I'm just
leasing a deliciously Ella ginger and
cashew ball my favorite so delicious I
really wish they weren't about 152 pound
per Bowl though a lot of money so a lot
of money when you eat them as much as I
do
oh yes out of film so I'll leave on the
screen you can watch my first video in
the new flat if you're not already
watched it so I'm just gonna quickly
edit this now sorry I know a lot of
people like to eat with your mouth open
8 it's rude to eat when you talk mm-hmm
but then do these people have a go to
work meetings or you know like brunch
meetings because if no one talked when
they a brunch meetings would go on oh
now I'm gonna go to White Rose and buy
some food I like took my food we've been
in the flat all day so I'm gonna go to
select a little walk around if we're
gonna go Bravo to our Waitrose and pick
up some stuff for dinner but just
generally just can't like stretch our
legs and look around the area I guess
just rather than fame you know I don't
look much different to how I did before
just put on my little booties I usually
hate wearing black boots looking dark
with light jeans because I haven't worn
like jeans like a long time quite liked
it like this actually
and then this blush pink suede jacket
and we're out of here
if you as I do who went out we got some
bits in from waitress I'm gonna make a
yummy tuna in a kind of peanut satay

wants to get back to the gym and get
back on the whole bandwagon back from
the gym mean I've had delicious acai
bowls I'm getting myself all ready cuz I
want to do some filming and I've got an
Instagram I need to take find upcoming
project with Charlotte Tilbury
I'm really looking forward to in fact
tonight as this video goes up I will be
going to Manchester tomorrow the day
after going to Charlotte Tilbury been
hosting an event there which is very
very exciting so what does need to take
a quick picture for that so I'm sort of
using a lot of use a lot of different
Charlotte Tilbury products that got my
collection and I love Kloss I have this
incredible for a new Hollywood
collection from Charlotte Tilbury and
these are amazing the like velvety
liquid lips they are incredible I've
already got a favorite of course this
one this is Dolly Byrd amazing shade
she's also just releasing these as well
Beauty light wand and the contour once
is contour and highlighters I'm gonna
show you how I use this contour wand
because I'm pretty shy about it so it's
got its cute little spongy tip
oh how easy this is to apply and I might
sound a little bit onto my eyelid do
I'll do that first
right gosh
I've got quite a warm rich tone - it's
almost got feel like slightly red toes
through this so guys when you see this
Instagram you know now the beauty light
one this is so pretty
again same top let's punish but with a
beautiful champagne highlight okay I'll
be back with you in a minute when I'm
gonna do my lips I'm really really
excited to show you these lips okay set
up I'm gonna put on I'm gonna put on a
show now to the right out corner for me
the motive there but I know slightly
slightly over drawing my lips as well I
really like this applicator almost like
the way it's curved moving that it like
the garage but your lip shape and when
that cut alone it is lovely but I'm
gonna put on dolly Bert
she's my favorite obviously because it's
like a look like moly tone
I always just use like a middle finger
like really creamy velvety finishes
really love that is so pretty not
highlight in the contour that it's
beautiful
okay I'm just gonna add a bit okay
in fact the whole finish I really like
the lips was put up a highlight on the
lips and into my inner corners as well
as took a little bit on and if a small
brush I think Charlotte Tilbury I think
there's only a few brands that I could
wear a full-face about one brand and
that would be Armani
Charlotte Tilbury and probably Dior as
well those three I could wear a full
face and
dreamily happy also I've got to mention
this amazing Charlotte Olympia package
that the Charlotte's an opportunist sent
me apparently Charlotte developed this
little Charlotte Olympia swatch with
Charlotte Olympia steam look at that
that is so cool I love this opening
little spider and then it just opens
into a little clutch I don't have any of
the Charlotte Olympia clip cheese I've
always wanted one huge thank you to the
Charlotte Tilbury tune for this full
face got my hair done I'm gonna do my
filming in my little chair first of all
I'm gonna eat my super salad box and
crush it like falafel and quinoa and
hummus all good stuff and I've also got
his little hazelnut protein ball I think
oh my stomach it's definitely hungry
okay filming done I am now late to see
