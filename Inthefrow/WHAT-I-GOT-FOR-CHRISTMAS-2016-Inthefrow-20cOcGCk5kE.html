had an amazing Christmas it's the first
video back after an amazing Christmas
day although I did post on Christmas Day
I posted like a really festive video
from a recent trip where we went skiing
with lots of friends and I'm pretty sure
that YouTube just totally messed it up
and it didn't reach very many of you so
if you didn't know that I actually did
upload a video on Christmas Day then I
did I will leave a link on the screen
now and link down below in description
box if you'd like to go and watch that
so don't think many of you knew that
even existed so thought I'd let you know
I now see I wasn't even gonna film this
video I'd really thought no I'm gonna
put it off well then I saw so many of my
friends filming these videos and I
really like watching these videos for me
the best thing about Christmas is
actually giving and giving to all my
friends and family I was just really
excited on Christmas Day because I had
got my brother a really really special
present that he wasn't even really
realizing he was gonna get I'd got him
an olympus pen which is on my favorite
cameras and it was a massive massive
tree and i was just so excited to wake
up and see his face and just see how
happy was the same way that i got a lot
of things from mom just to really cheer
up and it's just so so nice it does made
me really emotional sort of seeing all
my friends and family so so happy with
the gifts that i gave them so far for me
that's how amazing Christmas for us just
about giving and seeing how happy
everyone while so just having that kind
of love and anyway so anyway let's
actually get into the video and what I
got obviously as I get old I obviously
asked for less nice and less so I don't
actually ask for anything again this
year I had to sit to my mom lets just
have an amazing Christmas at home and
after getting anything but my mom just
goes a little bit crazy sometimes and
buys lots of lovely things and she's the
cutest thing in the world so I'll show
you some of the things that she got me
this is adorable so she got this from
not on the high street and it's a tea
towel with lots of things in it so you
can customize it yourself so it says
Victoria loves flowers Alex her family
bags and shoes could all people to her
friends in life and I don't think she
could have summarized me up any better
than this tea towel does right here I
love this she also knows I like the
white company a lot so she treated me to
some really lovely bath and shower gels
the verbena orange and lemon also
jasmine rose in a row Liam it goes
without saying I used to smell wonderful
this is a really really great brand and
she knows I really like them and this a
little bit of bath wash luxury and to go
along with the white company saying she
got more one of the winter candles in
fact I think this is the winter camera I
don't think there are more than one but
as you can imagine it to smell to
oranges and cinnamon oh just like wood
roasting fires and it's just absolutely
beautiful such as the winter candle so
they go a little trio thank you mom
along with smelly things she bought me
this really cool little set I don't
really know where she got this from I'm
not too sure where she got this from our
trying ask it and leave it down below
but it's like a oil-burning vase so it's
it's gorgeous
red and green fades like this and sorry
that you put a little tea light it's
good like that
then this dish sits on top this is
probably from the Yankee Candle because
these she got me up from Yankee Candle
she got me the Yankee Candle
candy cane forest smiles with elf seven
levels we're only where the gum chat
button is a beautiful was very
peppermint tea and Christmasy anyway you
poppies on top and Alice the candle
burns it forms into a waxy smelly
wonderfulness so this is gorgeous I love
anything like this in my home anything
candle related smelly related so she
knew this me pretty well so mom also
caught me these gorgeous
socks I don't really wear slippers I
just wear big big chunky socks I mean
I'm you can't see right now by wearing
sweatpants and after I've shown you
these I put me straight on they're just
lovely slipper socks gorgeous very edges
and a little cute like faux fur lining

and find out well look you love those a
lot too very very me and one of the big
things well actually she also got me a
really cool rose gold like drying rack
for all of my pots and pans and play you

kitchen filled with vegetable she got me
a big wooden box like homemade wooden
box with all these things inside so she
got me and Alex last mailing me lots of
kind of organic and vegan and vegetarian
types of snacks so it was just the
cutest idea because she knows like to
eat healthy and I'm trying out more of a
plant-based diet this year I'm trying to
cut back on my dairy eye things like
that so she's got me lots of amazing
things
so like the meridian strawberry fruit

barrage of these little naked trees

thoughtful he's still thought so I love
her so much

this year so this has got to be used a
lot from my brother he got me a
Selfridges voucher because you know me
it's my favourite shop in the world so
thank you to my brother Alex's dad
actually got me the most kind of
utilitarian product ever oh it's so good
this is a jewelry cleaner so it's called
the James all true 7000 ultrasonic
cleaner and you put in all of your
jewelry and it cleans it to perfection
and it's just one of those presents that
would never think by myself but the
other week I remember saying to violet
for me to get some silver cleaner
because I need to clean all my jewelry
together soft spruce so the fact they
got this was just like kind of spot-on
it's just a bit of a random present but
actually it's so quite usable so thank
you to it then I got a few wonderful
presents well off of my dad I got some
really sweet little present to gave me a
little bit of money so I can just go and
buy some things and then I put that with

last gift before I show you my final
present and that was an incredible gift
box from JD and Adidas totally
unexpected again but they sent me so
much new Jim where I'm so pumped for the
new year for getting fit and healthy I
know from sesor every single year and it
gets a little bit boring Kim this whole
like another healthy train but I'm
really really feeling it this year like
we're going completely plant-based which
want to cut out all meats or dairy or
eggs etc etc this year and just be the
best we can possibly be
so the gym is high on my agenda so this
came at the perfect time for me and they
sent me some credible credible new
things for example platinium this I wore
today after to the gym just got back
from the gym it's a really easy tank
just a throw on over your gym tart so I
got this one in black and they are so
amazing they sent me this in this color
I'm sorry I can exude to Frank's I'll
let you rip them off for the shower
before but I love these to bits with
this pink on the side lovely adidas
leggings this is super cool again
another tank just super Airy easy to
throw on over your sports bra and they
sent me a pair of trainers I'm pretty
sure Carly has this pair the ultra boost
they literally feel like you're wearing
socks they're really like the great to
run in they just mold to your feet
really and Wallace today and honest oh
that's so brilliant that it rubbed me
they felt really secure and my feet just
felt really comfortable in them when I
was doing a lot of my workout so big big
thank you to JD and adidas for an
absolute incredible present I'll list
all the things I've shown you in case
you like and they're my list and down
below as well because you might have
seen something that you like too anyway
let's just get into two final presents
the first one being something that I was
incredibly gifted on my trip to Paris if
you saw my Instagram I went away with
Dior to Paris a few weeks ago and it was
just such a beautiful Christmassy trip
I've just a full blog post on it with
lots of pictures which I'll leave down
below and I might try and link here if
I'm able to I don't know
and on that trip they amazingly gifted
us all
one of the beautiful Dior card holder
flora card wallet say this and this is
in the baby pink now that's slightly
different colors and mindless in the
baby pink which is so me this has got
the famous do your patterning all over
the do your dangling chain in gold
hardware and then it opens up into this
sort of rainbow pink effect inside
inside here up this was my cell just
gift card rebel it and but how beautiful
is this stunning I'm going to use this
for all of my extra cards and any money
that I might have as well as I love it
so much I was just absolutely gobsmacked
when I open the box with that in and
finally another insane Dior gift I mean
honestly I feel like lucky scale the
world none of this I don't take any of
these things for granted by the way I'm
just extremely extremely grateful for
everything that people bought this year
a name thing and Alex treated me by
taking me to do you might seen in my
come shopping with me video I might
leave out the screen if I can so you can
go watch it if you like that's where we
went and bought this and I really really
wanted a dual card wallet because I use
so many different bags and move between
as long as a card wallet I could throw
into each bag for Christmas it came in
the stunning CD packaging in the red and
the gold it was just so beautifully
packaged in here and it just came late
just looked up here it also came in a
small D or just wallet and inside this
is my card wallet so this is the Lady
Dior card holder in the metallic gold
elbow for me this is more of a gold and
silver it's not like a really yellow
gold it's the kind of gold that I
actually really like and then on the
other side or I'd have my cards in it
this is more a shiny finish so much
bigger briquette with this is what we're
showing you finish it says Christian
Dior Paris and you've got room for two
cards and then you also have a larger
slot in the back so I've got three of my
cars all fitted in here for everyday
when I need them and again you get the
Dior charms that hand us off the side so
it's just very compact and simple but
absolutely stunning and
so as you know Dior is like my favorite
luxury brand so the fact that Alex
treated me to this for Christmas was
just an absolute dream come true and I
love him to bits for it in my bag now I
can be taking this and for other days
I'm going shopping I can take this with
all of my like store cards and
everything else inside here so I kind of
had the distal Diageo which is a little
bit insane and again I feel extremely
grateful so that's everything that I got
for Christmas guys I hope you enjoyed
this video I really enjoyed making this
last year so I kind of figured I've got
to do it this year as well so I really
hope you enjoyed this as well big thank
