of December which is the day that the
majority of people go home for Christmas
including this guy this guy and me see
how many people down there now yeah I
mean it's not nowhere near as much as I
thought it would be no but we will see
we've got a horrible feeling I'm gonna
end up sat in the galley way of the
Train on the floor long as we're on this
train I really got it I just want to be
on the train but assignees John we've
got all of the suitcases my brand-new
suitcases look a pretty here this
massive beast and I like this one so
we're all kicked it down hi guys it's
boxing day welcome back
I I kind of accidentally took a few days
off I didn't actually plumb - I wasn't
going to I was really enjoying doing
vlogmas and I was rocking every day you
know I just needed a few days off just
to chill and see family and friends and
just have a bit of fun alone time I
guess and just catch it with people
without a camera that's why I did so
today is Boxing Day I have spent the
morning doing some sale shopping first
off I love the Boxing Day sales I mean a
Black Friday sale was fun but I feel
like Boxing Day sales are always like
the best the absolute best the most
amount of brands go into sale at Boxing
Day and the discounts are better so I
usually treat myself every year I'm not
going to a few lovely pieces that you
can wear throughout the rest of the next
yeah so I've just got a few but in fact
I'll show you a few bits I just got well
I bought in the box and a sale so
headlong phase post if you like and you
want a bit Vince both I'm sure all these
things will still be on sale by the time
you see this so this is why I've just
kind of a few pieces I've just got look
at this bag it's so beautiful it's not
for like spring it's gorgeous colors
these are very Megan at or near any calf
calf height boots these I've had my eye
on now for about four or five months and
they've just got into sales that's
awesome I always loved looking on our
John Proctor sale I've got my nails just
broken I can't show that does have some
good discounts I've always wanted max
Americo and they've got a few on sale
and this blaze it was just like
amazing so I've can split up this blog
post as to what I've just treating
myself to what I'm still thinking about
maybe looking at these are things I
already own that just got into sale
including this coat I know a lot of you
guys like they've obviously put a few
back on there and these are extra things
I think they're apps that you're awesome
but go along to that if you need some
inspector get ready yes so I'll show you
what I got for Christmas in a second
rather than doing the full video I
thought it'd be nice let's do it in a
vlog a little more informally okay if I
just start first forward oh no that is
why it's breaking don't lean your camera
on a box with the bed yeah the one thing
I did when I tried out today not spawn
by the way I mean you know on the farm
on anyway and worked on my lot but they
just release this I knew am I to go
essence and Foundation cushions
they're like first cushion foundation I
am so excited so I wanted to try that
today I thought it would kind of try it
together on camera so I know that the
battleground in an overly fabulous right
now mom's wardrobe open but hey her well
as I'm doing this I'm also like you know
what but not too because I didn't really
vlog it so last thing the last thing
that you'll have seen will be us in
Edinburgh so I will insert some of
Edinburgh right now well
almost and very excited alex has never
would have been discovered before she's
proud to move
a little bit of food and a lot of food
yeah I'm going out for some dinner in
Edinburgh I really want to get a picture
in my new red suit and this is Oberon
new watching my collection and it's so
affordable by the way they're after a
suit especially a red one I love this
so it's from reserved I'll leave the
links down below for you my red
strawberry bag kind of match and then
taking some pictures in my that was an
awesome trip but days after that we're
just us coming home here I've spent time
with mom me mum went shopping we did
coffee dates we did a lot to catch you
know Buddha baking wooded Alex is a
family meal for Alex and we saw the
family different families for family
meal with my family I've got a cold so
it's been a lot of famine but a lot of
family time I'm gonna get into this
foundation really try it out I love the
look of this this is a cute little boy
looks like pointed hurting you into
there I kind of want to try it with the
sponge to see how we go I'm here she's
in shade 20 no is it no shade to shade
to when I'm not talented I'm used to
shade to it Armani
when I don't and I'm usually a four so I
often quite like to mix too
I'm not gonna get the best results with
that right now I'm just going to go into
my usual beauty blunder I'm really
impressed with that actually coverage on
that is gorgeous
yeah it's still quite chewy that's
really lovely actually I like that a lot
okay I'm already so we're gonna go out
and take some pictures and then when I'm
back I'll show the breath
get a picture of me
we did a nice and set bitch absences in
terms of light this is definitely bad
air but sorry about the backdrop thought
I'd go through some of my Christmas
presents I usually like to film this in
a much more kind of like a formal
setting but I just didn't really fancy
it this year
cuz I've done it for last few years and
I know that a lot of people don't like
these videos etc so I thought I'd just
sort of show you in a much more like
informal setting some of my amazing
presents I'm very very very grateful for
obviously I'll start off with presents
that my dad got me so my mom and dad
were separated if I haven't been done
before I was staying at my mom's and
then we go over to my dad's in the
morning on Christmas Day so they've got
me a few lovely so lovely presents a few
of these all of the bonus boxes this
first one they got me a set of this so
cool these copper serving fork and spoon
just R if we have any friends around or
even if me not like so like doing any
cooking and we like serve things they're
just absolutely beautiful my dad and
also my Nana they also got me this set
of the spoons for different metal spoons
it's like copper silver gold and rose
gold so so nice just a little special
spoons my dad and my stepmom also got me
this chocolate shoe which is very
appropriate I must say well God knows
how I'm gonna get through this much
chocolate but very cute and they all
forgot me so many other random my dad
likes to buy me random stuff because he
likes have a laugh they got me some
Maori girls and very cute little
marigolds no mice which Alex will love
to wear we've cleaning the house no
super cute and they also caught me with
a veggie veggies scrubber
I used to have one of these there you go
but this one's like a little carrot with
a little top and you can like scrub all
you fetch with it and then they all
forgot me there's this is from all the
bonus and it's like a little jewelry box
the idea being that if you travel a lot
like we do you can take your any jewelry
you want inside this box it's all
together I know where it is and it's not
just like floating around your bags
it's just a really cute little hard
leather case love that a lot also got me
this which is so cool friends and things
a coffee table photo album it's gonna
think you can can I leave out I mean
it's huge you're expected to be this big
but when you open it up I mean so got
the stuff inside but it does have pages
you manage to stick all your photos onto
obviously the idea being make you build
up a photo album we have so many photos
I pull the rides especially just
floating around the house that get lost
and get like milled up with now what I
think I want to do is have a battle
pretty sick awesome nice tape and then
we'll just start taping them in and then
we've glit she's got a full book like
photo album sticker book of friends
stuff so a lot of this super cute Santa
cottony finish my mom got me this
gorgeous candle smells design this is
the coconut leaf scented candle it's
from white stuff just a really pretty
candle but the smell is absolutely
beautiful
um she also got me this book this
cookbook it's called a modern way to
cook by Anna Jones over 150 quick smart
flavor-packed recipes for everyday and
I'm pretty sure it's a vegetarian book
which is pretty great yeah it's
vegetarian cookbook he's not being it's
vegetarian and I've already looked
through and there are some absolutely
beautiful looking oh my god look sweet
potato lime and peanut soup I'm
absolutely making that so that was after
mom she also got me a pair of all Akili

handy for writing down anything at my
desk my brother very kindly got me a
selfish about you
his friend in my favorite store so
thanks bro my sister in life I did get

um bar in here on bar chocolate organic
chocolate blueberry cookies I don't eat

eaten about four packets out of there so
that's gone down well alex is hilarious

pliers last week and have any so thank

think you'll love with a knife in the
kitchen or even the bathroom some
planets but just a really unique present
and the last thing that my mom got me
well there is Victoria's memory box so
it's like a wooden box that she's had
completely customized on here it's got
ballet shoes it's got a camera for
officers that they're going to drug free
and everything I do and also the heels
because it's kind of like it's not from
being younger growing up and now into
like my girl boss mode I am you know to
be honest when I opened this Christmas
day I actually got really really upset
really emotional if you guys haven't
following the blocks kind of around
since to start when I started doing them
like weeks ago for like half a year ago
now
my granddad passed away in June so it's
the first Christmas we've had without my
granddad so inside this box were lots of
really beautiful pictures of me my
granddad me and my my other
granddaughter who past ten years ago my
Nana pictures of me when I was younger
and even things like my first watch is
in here my therapist watch I love this
and this is my watch I had my mom's kept
it I can hear like some teeth that I had
taken out during surgery that grown in
the roof of my mouth
they were literature growing enemies my
mouth so she's gotten better she's got
some cards in here that as a card here
like from my granddad things like that
that you've written to me really
beautiful car and I don't even know when
this must been from its from my Nana and
granddad so this must be 15 16 years old
this card for when she passed so this
absolutely amazing what what to make you
motion actually look inside don't look
as Irena yeah really really beautiful
very sentimental very heartfelt present
for my mom which I didn't expect and I
will keep this now
for the rest of my life and just keep
building memories for them in the
emotional oh yeah I'll keep building the
memories and obviously mine Alex's
memory
can go in here and then my children and
you know it's a such a lovely idea to
get this so the only thing I happened to
show me that is what Alex got me I feel
like a completely oversold this on
Twitter because I was just I was really
really excited about this gift it's it's
something I've really always wanted but
never bought myself and never really
thought too much about what apart from
all that big cool town I put this on
Twitter to Sarah or Alex and so well
I've got my such an incredible present
can't wait
so many people thought that maybe he got
me a ring or something and it's like no
no yeah it's not a ring case I'm sorry
so Alex got me so these are a pair of
Beats headphones wireless and there's a
studio version ones so they fit over the
ears which is amazing for me with your
map travel we do how I don't have a pair
of these already I don't actually know
so come in this cute little pouch that
you carry them in to protect them and
they come in about six different colors
and the other colors I must admit
they're a bit you know sit like simple
was like a black green red but then I
found these on the Apple website in this
color I hope you can see in this light
but it's like a beige pale dusky beige
pink the main thing that love back know
is that they're a bit larger here around
ear so it fits around the ear and
completely noise Council so when you've
got so when you've got your music on
this sounds funny now when you've got
your Emma shouted and maybe I'm shouted
will you when you've got your music on
you can't hear anything else gets
completely around your ears that's so
great okay so these will completely
block out all those knives apart from
what I'm listening to
so I'm very very excited about it and
they're completely wireless it does also
come with like a little a jack as well
so you can start you can plug it in yeah
it's got a these so things like my main
present for mics and they just fall like
this super cute that you're gonna pop
them back in also me Alex also did a
cute little like stocking filler moment
before we came back we thought let's
open our stocking Phyllis would have to
bring them home because we already
brought home for suitcases if you saw
that Instagram picture and Alex got me
some love
he got me some gin he got yeah it got me
a bathtub gin he got me a huge bottle of
vanilla syrup because I love my vanilla
syrup and my coffee it looks like a big
moaning it's at moaning moaning um
vanilla syrup it got me that oh my gosh

got him a Nintendo switch with Zelda and
not a Super Mario and he's already
bought Super Mario Racing and we played
Elliot so much fun I forgot that I got a
make do your Salvage perfume perfume you
know aftershave I just smells amazing so
gotten one of those I got my book I got
him a Neil deGrasse Tyson book cuz he
loves reading about space and strong he
likes Neil deGrasse Tyson and yeah so he
does that like a little little stocking
Phillips which was cute that is
everything that I got for Christmas
which I feel extremely lucky for I feel
like I've got loads last year but I
actually think this is more than now
she's crazy when I told my family your
friends don't really get me anything
honestly I prefer giving than receiving
I mean obvious amazing both ways but I
just literally love to get presents
family time the past few days has so
many family meals it's been family I
left a family meal for lunch dinner
lunch dinner and then last night we had
everyone over to our house and my mom
cooked Christmas dinner and it was
wonderful and it was so nice just having
downtime it was nice having time off no
cameras I mean I Instagram at each day
but that was it and it was pre-dawn
pictures so you actually haven't worked
for a few days and it's felt really
really nice so today I was like I really
would have liked today I'm excited so

cold against my voice is feeling a bit
funny what other wife I'm all good very
