doing super well this video is gonna be
all about the things I have been loving
to wear in the past month so pretty much
all of September so that pretty much
takes them to account Fashion Week
fashion month as a whole it's been
pretty insane from New York to London I
miss Milan this season but I did go to
grass with Dior and then back to Paris
door and then I had some time in Paris
with L'Oreal so it was a very very long
life for and a bit weeks lots of
different outfits so I thought I kind of
rounded up and talked about the pieces
that I loved the absolute most what I'm
getting the most wear out of now why I
can see myself wearing for the next few
months into winter time as well so let's
get right into this bad boy guess I'll
start off just with this sweater quickly
this is my Victoria Beckham sweater it's
like a jersey rib material in navy very
much my kind thing I just love all the
details in the can of the way that the
ribbing goes one direction goes
vertically and then it goes horizontally
and then vertically and it's just a
super cozy knife knit so today it's
Saturday today and in the mood for a
really kind of cozy chilled day hence
why my hair is not overly done I'm just
very kind of chilled me so I hope that's
all good but that's what I was feeling
today I often draw accessories laughs
but I kind of want to keep this off with
accessories this time but the first one
being this incredible bag from Anaheim
Ash if you saw the flog then you'll have
seen that I built this back with their
builder bag service you can do it online
you can do it inside Selfridges that's
where I did it I went in store and shows
my own bag so the idea is that you
choose the bag first for smaller medium
this is some medium size or small size
like I remember I'll leave it link down
below that well this is the one that
comes with this strap or it did at least
in the store but you can also buy the
strap too for your own bag and attach it
I also picked his gorgeous embellished
strap as well as a longer strap but
generally I leave it almost as hanging
down around it like a
bag necklace which I really really love
and I also have this furry little friend
on the front which is very very anti
Marsh and that is my overall back so
this is myself just back with a little
bits and bobs insider everything comes
in their own boxes which I thought was
really gorgeous you can kind of keep
everything super safe for when you need
it and everything also has its own
little dust bags he can keep it yeah if
you don't want to attach the bag you can
keep it safe in a drawer but then I also
have this I don't have to touch the back
what the bag came with this already so
like a handle strap so this pushes
through here and then attaches so then
the idea of anything you can count like
this or you can buy another strap so I
also picked up this incredible strap too
and the idea then is and like this I'm
not showing this very well and instead
it becomes a complete change of shape
and becomes like a bucket box instead of
wearing it this way around it instead
becomes like this way around more like a
bucket bag shape that was very very
difficult to show and illustrate but
that's the idea so I have all these
different little bits and bobs that
could add to my bag combined as many or
as little as you want you can build it
your own way make it your own style so
many different types of bags let's just
say I had an absolute ball building this
really really really enjoyed the whole
experience kind of wanted to show you
that in a full back to the bag this is
just a perfect autumnal easy bag to wear
for travel it's gonna be great because
it's just so big but just for day-to-day
it's just an absolutely glorious bag
I'll just quickly throw in a boot and
accessory here I know I've mentioned it
before but I absolutely loved oh but
have no regrets of buying these bad boys
they are certainly a unique and very
statement piece but they are extremely
autumnal I'll be able to wear these a
lot throughout the next few months and a
big big big fan and I have just loved
absolutely loved wearing these recently
so huge fan of those smell the bag that
I've got a lot of love for and a lot of
you guys seem to have a lot of love for
too
for me instagrams I put up with this
back this is a sage Aubree bug in the
very sweet blush pink more of a nude
pink in honesty but it's a really pretty
easy size one's large zip across the top
I haven't even taken out the strap
that's how much I've been enjoying
myself just kept a strap inside in the
bag but it has a long strap too if you
like it's one of those really easy
colors to pair with everything like any
kind of nude bag is but that nude pink
there's a little touch more color and
it's just absolutely adorable I've
really really enjoyed wearing this and
also the guys from stage robbery saw
that I was wearing it and they sent me
discount code for you guys to use I
think it's like 15% off and leave that
link down below but you can get 30% off
with that code and the last bag of
course I have to mention is this Coach
bag in the incredible red shade it's a
Celina Gomez Coach bag but it's just
extremely wearable bag and I have got a
lot of use out of this so far and again
this just also come with a strap as well
if you prefer a shoulder strap let's
just get into some clothing pieces shall
we
this have pretty much not left my back
since I got it this is from n Pele it's
a very soft and luxurious cashmere knit
it's a real neck style but quite short
real neck is nothing to empowering a
little bit like this I guess not nothing
too huge and the slightly asymmetric
back in that it's slightly longer at the
back but it's just extremely comfortable
I've just been throwing this on I've
been tucking my hair into it kind of
making my hair quite messy bits falling
out it's really really like that style
at moment so I've been really enjoying
this it's more of a luxurious knit for
the autumn this t-shirt has had a lot of
wear thus far this is my son Laurent tea
with oh my gosh you've got yeah I may
have to watch this got makeup on Sandler
on across the front with the lips sort
of smoking and it's got a big X through
that as well I mean I realized it's more
of a pricey tea for a white t-shirt but
it's going to show I've been wearing
just tucked into jeans tucked into
skirts and leather skirts suede skirt
it's so easy to wear with everything I
just feel it kind of elevates an
ordinary white tee with just something a
little bit more slow getting a bit more
branded and I just really really like
this t-shirt a lot this
top I got from Rhys and I have had so
much wear up this so far or a couple of
times over Fashion Week I've won it two
events I've won at traveling to and from
Paris I wear my Dior bra under this but
you could quite easily wear a gorgeous
lacy black bra are you happy to show off
you could wear a black band around this
you could wear a camisole obviously with
it being a black it doesn't show too
much but you definitely need some sort
of bra to cover up your nipples or else
people will be able to see uh nipples
but I'm just a big big fan of this the
overall shape the overall fit the fabric
I've had a lot of compliments on it it's
pretty smitten with it it's just a
really good piece to add into the
wardrobe just for something a bit more
texture a bit more patterning but
nothing too in-your-face okay
this jacket is also HUD alert a lot of
love so far on my Instagram and on my
blog post I did this is a beautiful
absolutely gorgeous fabric as well it's
a lovely wooly it feels almost cashmere
is so soft
check print in raspberries in this very
it's almost but knee on this pink in
here and it's got a navy and it's got
Burgundy's very very awful not vibes
jacket it has the signature rose gold
pieces on here that Ted Baker are known
for rose gold buttons as well and it's
also belted so it just pulls you in and
makes you look really cinched in and
it's just extremely extremely flattering
I have been loving awareness this month
I had so many compliments thus far I
just play one of my favorite things I've
picked up all year khaki olive green and
it's very structured military esque coat
it's a wonderful soft fabric it's just
got a really cool easy look to it you
can drape this over your shoulders you
can just wear it open with the collars
pop like I usually do I mean over
leather trousers white t-shirts that's
how I've been wearing it absolutely
adore that style I feel with my hair as
well my hair being such a cool tone
color this cool tone green really really
matches so well and I cannot tell you
how many people have bought this jacket
so but this coat how many people have
bought this coat so far from our
recommendation so I'm so glad and I hope
you guys all loving it so far I know a
few bloggers as well who have bought
this because have seen me in it so I'm
so thrilled I'm so glad you guys like it
too
I'm so obsessed I'm gonna be wearing
this for the next few months so I hope
you can get used to it
the leather trousers that I was
referring to with that jacket are
actually a pair look a bit worn in now
because I've let you not take them off
well this is a pair from Rhys I always
get leather trousers from Rhys they just
fit better than any little leather
trousers but he always size down one
size so that they're really really
tightly fitted they were just pull in at
all the right places as long as you can
get them tied up around your waist
regardless of how uncomfortable they may
be at first give it a few hours of
wearing them and they will loose not so
honestly I'd go one smaller but these
are just the perfect fit and they go
with everything so as I do with every
autumn winter I'm back in my leather
trousers and I will not be taking them
off now you probably knew this one was
coming but I couldn't do this video of
what I love this month without including
this dress this is a high-neck midi
dress in a navy cotton Jersey rib gold
buttons to this section so it almost
looks a bit like a wrap dress feel
orange stripes to each cuff and that's
kind of about it in terms of detailing
it just fits really really well I wear
it with the red boots
I like these together it's just a very
very flattering piece and on those days
when you cannot be bothered to get
dressed and you just want to wear
something really easy and really really
cozy this is one of those things I just
throw it on at all times it is honestly
a winner and it's so affordable if I
remember rightly I think I paid like
25-pound for this dress I kind of wish I
bought another one now for the day that
this one needs to be thrown away because
I'm wearing it so much and the very last
thing to mention actually is a dress
this is a dress by a Greek designer
called Kristoff scoffs trellis and I
wore this through the day to the Loreal
fashion show in Paris and I also wore it
for a little date night of the day with
Alex and it's one of my favorite dresses
now in my whole wardrobe this is a
see-through lace as you can see but I've
just been wearing it with a lovely black
lacy bra underneath and you can't really
tell the difference between this fabric
and the bra so it kind of looks like
it's got a little bit more covering over
the boob area and that it goes down into
a skirt and a lot of people thought it
was a top took too
to skip no no it's such a little mini
dress and I think it's absolute
beautiful the use of the colors and the
fabrics it's got a very Indian vibe to
this style of the skirt it's very rich
and luxurious and beautiful piece I'm so
happy to have this in a wardrobe I love
it so much and also if you're looking
for some bridal wear have a look the
Christoff cost roll off site I'll leave
a link down below I'm definitely going
to look in there for the day that I am
looking to get married because the
dresses are exquisite they're so
beautiful and in fact the entire
