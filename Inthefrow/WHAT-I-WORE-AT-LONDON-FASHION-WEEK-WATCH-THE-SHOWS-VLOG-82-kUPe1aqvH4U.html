and it was Valentine's Day yesterday we
had a very chilled one we stayed in Alex
made me delicious breakfast food because
it's so good hunt it but yeah it was
absolutely delicious so we had but did
that we watched some friends episodes
and that was kind of it for a fantasy I
worked we both worked all day and the
day before that with Alex's birthday and
again we worked all day because we just
been so so busy we're taking some time
off soon so don't worry guys
I know so many of you message and say
like can you please just chill out for a
bear do so nice of you thank you I think
my mom's put you all up to it to be
honest
oh yeah we are working towards somewhat
of a holiday somewhat soon I just got to
get next few weeks other way which are
exciting weeks learning Fashion Week
starts tomorrow and yeah that's it
exciting things look forward to there oh
yeah well I like this birthday again
we're just well that came we didn't do
anything for it so good things have just
been so busy I've had so many amazing
projects um I'm not complaining I like
to really complain it's birthday but we
both just have to work anyway this
morning let's let's bring you into the
present good you're gonna make it
alright hey you got a good Prezi alex is
going getting tattooed again I've just
put on some I was wearing retinol last
night some wearing my broad-spectrum
sunscreen SPF 40 moisture mapped with
the tint from Lumia Andy mine that's s
I'm just gonna quite a bit of concealer
and that's it well maybe a little time
but the lip as well a little bit also
I've had so many awesome comments on my
latest blog post one of them which was
that film noir shoot if you've not seen
that already super proud of it Alex
worked extremely hard and that came out
really well so hopefully you guys like
that and also I wrote a post about the
positivity of the Gael boss Tim and
movement and again like you guys can't
read it like that so I'm really enjoying
writing these kind of like thought
pieces recent
I've decided recently that I think what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna slightly cut
back on the vlogs and only do one a week
like in the past six months up time to a
week think I want to slightly cut down
on that to one a week
condense it choose the best days to vlog
just to give myself a little bit more
time off from it personally but and
hopefully to make the content better for
you guys as well there might be some
weeks that I do too if I'm doing lots
and lots of things but otherwise I'm
gonna cut down a little bit really okay
any bit of RMS Luminizer give me some
glue and I'm gonna put on a little bit
of the top gonna put on a little bit of
the Tom Ford fiber for our gel as well
so do the Browns a little tiny bit but
that's literally it nice and fluffy oh
yeah and in the interim I forgot to say
I also got my eyelashes l Fjeld I only
had a few of my SDS lashes left on I
think I've been treating him a bit badly
because I've been putting mascara on
them because I felt like the word many
there anymore which I shouldn't have
done so anyway so I went back and
instead got my eyes eyelash my eyelashes
lvl look again so I'm kind of back to
normal
she's nice right like that's all I'm
doing today
for my face and my skin just gonna go
get some nice breakfast okay we got
breakfast so a day in this cafe which is
my favorite nothing yeah we've been
looking at Kanye West Valentine's Day
pictures of Holly I leave amazing couple
anyway so I have the eggs and we have
Carter toast let's have some amazing and
I've got this caramel latte starting the
day off right okay so we have got back
to the flat very very quickly because we
had a courier deliver things so
obviously it's Fashion Week tomorrow I'm
going to a lot of amazing shows again
I'm really excited about this season I
mean every season for the past four
years has been really really amazing my
dream come true Fashion Week's this year
I think it's gonna be even better I'm so
excited
and yeah I had a tech thing that I
needed to be at the house because a
courier was on his way with a dress from
Temperley for me so I've just had my
dress through it's a very very
spring/summer I remember seeing this on
the catwalk last season I'm gonna put on
some music and I'm going to get the
Duster out the Hoover out and clean up
this flap because it's a disaster there
are clothes these are all my clothes
still from New York haven't even bought
put them away cuz I can't admit think
about it the place is just a tip is just
on everything so I am gonna blitz this
entire house while Alex works on is the
other bits that I can't work on so
that's the exciting day I have planned
morning guys it's day 1 of Fashion Week
how exciting again I'm looking extremely
bronzed today because I happened last
night almost like to tell me before
these big occasions
I'm just put on a very pretty greeting I
put the Chanel LED for ombre in a road
movie this is cool green shade I'm just
finishing up my eyes and I realized but
today is the first day since the trip to
the Maldives that I can actually try out
the new benefit bad girl bang I'm so
went all the way to the Maldives with
benefit for the launch of this I had
false eyelashes on so I couldn't even
use it which is just typical and then I
had falsies on for ages and then I've
just had them off and I've just had my
eyelashes LVL so now I'm a good point
again when my lashes are back to what
they were so I can actually try help
this mascara
we're new so I thought we could just try
out together okay let's see how we go
okay well it's very very lengthening
right now and very separating I've seen
this on of people that have used it it's
so separating that you can actually see
every single one of my lashes right now
Wow actually amazing I've never seen a
lot of separation like this oh my gosh
that is good that is good actually
oh yeah she's like found some cotton
eyelash on I can see it's really long so
go one false eyelash and the rest of a
my own hopefully that's impressive
that's really really impressive
Wow I'm honestly so impressed with this
not just saying that cuz I was actually
all night the truth for a lifetime I've
never ever ever seen a mascara separate
lashes like this like it's combing every
single one and they're lifting and it
literally is just like a firm wait let
me just clean up my eye line eyelids so
annoying when you spent so long when you
really shut up oh my god it's good it
was funny the amount of people I saw on
social media that were like they went
all the way to the Maldives for mascara
yeah we did because I'm not mentioned
such on camera yet but I've said this to
so many different people I've spoken to
about it I mascara for a brand
especially benefit the benefit mascara
czar some of our best selling products
ever I roller lash bad gal mascara and
you've got their real as someone like
the most famous mascaras in the whole
market and extremely massive sellers
every morning leaves this lyn is really
so if you imagine that mascaras
especially for burn lack benefit are
such a messy sellin product and if you
can create a mascara that people will
buy every single time that their mascara
dies you're onto a like a huge winner
I'm pretty sure I've heard in the past
that particular mascaras sell at one
every minute so if you can nail it and
you can promote on the sky
to that many people and then nail it and
it being an insane mascara laughs the
benefit felt a lot about this mascara
and I understand why because whoa you
know so yeah the promotion taken lots of
people to maldis was absolutely worth it
and I completely get it I also had the
best time ever it's extremely thankful
to be a part of it but to anyone that
was like well it's just mascara yeah but
it's not just mascara is it it's a
number one best-selling product
potentially which is gonna lead to
millions and millions and millions of
sales very clever but it's also a very
good product so I'm sold
I'm sold it's so good right I think I'm
ready to go
I'll makeup done this is what I'm
wearing today so absolutely I mean this
is so me this pink it's like a really
baby pink but it's got some really cool
light knit details on it like around the
sides and around the collar just a pink

bit of a rush it was a good time to
clean the action so now I get you this
clean you'll be happy to know after we
left year coming to see me last night we
just came home as the pretty bad so
there's absolutely nothing really to
vlog but today Sunday it's my busiest
day today it's always one day that's
like super busy and the one he'd read a
little bit today I have three
back-to-back shows and literally like
hour in between so if any of those run
over then I'm completely messed up if I
know I've got four back-to-back shows
and then I've got to get back you can
get myself redress for the BAFTAs later
so today actually I just thought and
quickly come on cameras mine what I'm
doing my makeup just to show you guys
the new foundation I'm using this is
what I've been using on my skin the past
few days Fashion Week the new I sell
all-in-one glow foundation I can't tell
you how many messages actually got to my
Instagram story through the day
saying they'd see my skin on sasori's
and what was I wearing so many messages
I was like it's this brand new
all-in-one glow foundation and then a
lot of people asking about my highlight
and it was a mix it was this from
bareMinerals I just found in gold
obsession but it's almost like and very
like bronzy gold pace and I've just been
stopped rubbing it over and it's a lot
really really lovely and then I decided
obviously because I don't do anything
without this - the RMS Luminizer and
that's kind of it my skin and then but
yeah this is just awesome
I feel like my skin is getting
slowly-slowly better I feel it also
feels like tighter it's both showed my
forehead feel up my wrinkles are going a
bit and know before you a scope not on
Botox although I'd really quite like
some just here well the wrinkles are
forming now I'm almost 30 they're coming
I can see them this has become a new
favorite foundation brush for me I know
you shall have my massive lemare brush
but I'm really quite enjoying this
little Bobby Brown life before coverage
faced with this again so I think I am
ready I'll
this so no it's actually a over
dress maybe I should show off more of
the dress underneath it should just pull
this around a little bit just you can
actually see it it's so nice this is a
Templi dress so notice the template show
this morning and it's just wow I mean
look at this neckline so pretty so
pretty
any excuse to not wear a bra not to make
himself an espresso yeah so it's
actually a dress this really cool slit
through the middle and like to be
careful that when I sit down across my
legs and then it's kind of like this
matching chiffon shirt dress which would
be so beautiful for like summer holidays
but that's over top and then it's belted
with this red belt and then later on and
going to the Malone suli air
presentation so I'm wearing a pair of
that incredible Maureen know the
Maureen's yeah the mules which so
perfectly fit with the color scheme so
pleased and I feel like this bag really
works it's Burberry bag very nice of
every show it was yesterday and I kind
of like to match my outfits to the day

pink and and the blues so I mean
