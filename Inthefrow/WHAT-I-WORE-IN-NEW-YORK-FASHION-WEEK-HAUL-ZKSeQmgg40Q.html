video
I am in New York as you can tell from
the new location I'm here for a few days
with Proenza Schouler they're launching
their brand new fragrance Arizona
tomorrow night massive party in New York
so I'll come over to New York with those
guys for a few days and I'm doing a few
other things if you're the shows and
events as well so super excited to be
here again because I was coming here I
needed to bring some new things to take
pictures off to wear to different shows
and to wear to all the different events
so I went shopping I went to all my
favorite places and found some new items
to sit into a wardrobe just to show you
guys kind of like what I wore in New
York mixed in with a hole just to give
you an idea of what exactly I was
wearing well here right it's quite a lot
of things I'm gonna go through
everything and then I'm gonna insert
pictures of the outfits that kind of war
with them just so you can see how I
styled them as well first up though I
just want to give a quick mention to
this gorgeous new fragrance from Proenza
Schouler this is Arizona at their very
first perfume this is a really gorgeous
chic modern unique brand so they need a
perfume that really kind of matched that
and I really think that they've done it
with this the whole bottle design is
really gorgeous very chic and the
fragrance is just feminine then there's
also kind of like undertones like
because that's quite a bit deeper in
there
I mean I'm rubbish it described
fragrances I'll leave some fragrance
notes down below in the description so
you can kind of see what it's all about
absolutely beautiful so very very
exciting about that looks brand
brand-new
I leave it link down below it's just
just come out so you guys will hear
about it first and as an incredible gift
the Proenza team have also gifted me
this absolutely beautiful little clutch
so I'll be able to wear this tomorrow
for the event I'm so so pleased I've
never had a Provenza back before in my
collection so thank you so much the team
for this incredible gift ok kicking it
off first of all with the first thing I
am super excited about this is the
aviator jacket of dreams
it's a shilling it's mint it's super
padded super thick it's perfect for this
super cold weather that's why I really
wanted this for New York it's just so
cool it's so cool this is brand new in
for All Saints for the season and I'm
absolutely in love with this I think I'm
gonna wear that actually with the
net just a very mean it very just cream
big chunky knits style a very cool shape
to it it's quite got quite a modern
shape to the whole knit within in the
bottom it has this inserted shirt
material it looks like you're wearing
the knit over the top of your shirt
which is a kind of style I've always
tried to emulate and never managed to
find the right pieces to go together so
this does all the work for you though
we've seen this all ourselves like that
is super cool over a pair of leather
trousers especially if this will look
awesome and I think that's how I'm gonna
wear them just with a pair of leather
trousers that I brought with me so big
big fan of that okay now this guy I've
worn a couple of times recently you've
probably seen it a few times but don't
think I've talked about it too much on
camera actually yet this is my new ball
man skirt I'm absolutely in love with it
it's very much an investment piece but
it's something I know I'll keep forever
and I will keep on wearing wearing it's
an extremely flattering shape the colors
are beautiful it's just so wearable
it'll go with so many different things
so I have to bring it with me just in
case the right event came up that I
could wear this for and I'm thinking of
wearing that with this top this is from
Mian M I love this roughly lace around
the neckline it's just very pretty very
much me from I feel like last spring in
the spring before this kind of styling
or a lot but the best thing about this
are the fluted sleeves just very
feminine very girly but the whole top is
that kind of material that really
flatters the figure it sucks you in at
all the right places it smoothes you out
and a thing that look really cute tucked
into the Batman's skirt but we'll see
and if you've not seen them already
please do head over to my Instagram I'd
love it if you followed me over there
you'll be able to see so many more
pictures coming up as well on my
Instagram so it'd be great to have you
oh I bought this little hat I thought
this was absolutely adorable so I call
this little hat with these two pom poms
the quality of this is incredible it's
so thick gorgeous big chunky cable net
it's just very easy to wear and I knew I
needed a really warm hacks I heard it
was very cold here and it is very cold
so yeah this is super cute and so
affordable it's like twelve pounds ooh
this dress I love this dress so I saw
this on a sauce this is from Hugo Boss
and it's a super long line jump
style the fabric is like this gray mal
knit I just think it's really chic and
really cool and I'm gonna wear it with a
belt to tuck it in around the waist I
kind of cinch it a little bit and I
think this will either look amazing with
calf length boots
I brought some with me or my red
Balenciaga knife boots either one but
yeah I think it looks looks super cool
with that I love that a lot of thing
it's gorgeous
I get a lot of wear out of that and with
that I thought I could wear this leather
jacket this is my daughter-in cabana
leather jacket which I haven't worn
enough yet I love this jacket it's
incredible the amount of buttons on here
just makes this like really statement it
very much stands out this jackets a
little bit more it's more unique than
your usual leather jacket anyway notice
it's got the floral print and sign it's
very dark in Cabana what I just think
over that dress it look really cool so
this dress I picked up this dress for
New York as like something to wear for
dinners or events it's this beautiful
dress from Rick so and it's so funny
that Charlotte who I've come with from
Proenza
she has brought the exact same dress and
she said this morning she's brought the
most amazing dress for that and
straightaway I knew she had this dress
it was like the sidekick moment and I
was like is this dress from Rick's
though and she was like yeah and then
anyway she's got the exact same dress so
good taste that's all I can say it's
beautiful it is it's hundred percent
silk it's got these very cool like
Spacey patterns on it mixed with floral
it's extremely unique thing I love the
most is this very deep v-neck and it
just skims the boobs so it just fits
really really well you're not gonna get
any kind of gaping in the front and
feeling a little uncomfortable it just
fits perfectly and I think it's an apps
incredible dress and again with the red
boots this could look amazing one outfit
I am really excited about piecing
together actually I'm gonna put these
three together first of all you know how
much I love white t-shirts this one is
from visage you very obviously it's a
very large emblem on the front as
embellishments is like dueling this
embroidery
it's very statement white tee but I
think it's absolutely gorgeous I love
the primary colors I love the shape of
the t-shirt on and just tucked into some
leather trousers or some jeans just a
very cool t-shirt so I'm gonna wear that
with some matching visage jeans I love
the color of these are a really great
sort of light wash blue denim the legs
are very much like a straight leg very
cool style and then on the Pocket you've
got this embroidered and embellished
pocket too so it very much matches with
the t-shirt it's a very very cool pair
of jeans so really really excited to
wear those two together and to go with
those as kind of a piece to pull it all
together is this gorgeous Theory coat
this is almost like a coat cardigan I
cooked again because it's that's not
thinner drapey fabric you just kind of
drape over this would look amazing with
a gray hoodie underneath and this has
draped over the top this is very cool
very kind of New York style I think it's
gorgeous it's beautiful fabric it's a
fantastic length it's not too long it
skims over the thighs really an absolute
gorgeous fabric so I'm super excited
about wearing that okay and then they
felt fit I love I love a love okay this
I treat myself to this t-shirt because
you know how much I like white t-shirt
and my other summer on t-shirt I wore to
death and I knew how much I loved that
and I saw this one and was like okay I
need this in my life as well fair enough
if you don't like white tees you're not
going to wear them a lot fair enough but
I know how much usage and want to get
out of this white tee so for me it makes
it a lot more worth it and just love how
kind of retro that logo feels right
across the middle and I like the
placement it feels a bit off cuz usually
be like on a pocket or be up here but I
just like the placement I think it's
super cool so white tee and I'm gonna
wear think I'm gonna wear it with this
suit brand new suit guys I am loving my
suits if you've not seen my suit video
I'll leave it linked on the screen you
guys know how much I adore suits and
I've just found a brand new one to my
collection this is so amazing it's Greg
it's pinstripe I don't have anything
that's quite like this style and I love
how the front really pulls over your
boobs so that you've not got a very low
v-neck so if you do want to wear it with
a bra or anything else underneath you're
not gonna see too much of what's
underneath it's very much about the suit
and that's what I really really like so
this is like a brand brand new in for
the season I cannot wait to wear this I
love it in the legs on this it was a
really great straight leg very
flattering fit and just two last pieces
to
kind of knit pieces that I brought with
me just in case I could pair them with
anything this fabric is absolutely
beautiful it's soft and it's really
thick and it's not very smoothing knit
kind of fabric but look a look at the
color it's baby pink it comes into a
fitted cuff at the end and it's not too
long either so again just kind of tucked
into your leather trousers or into jeans
it's got a really cool style it's really
really like this a lot and the very last
piece is this one just a great kind of
underlay oh really
again this could look great on to the
suit it could look great underneath that
pink coat you know it's just a very kind
of smoothing flattering cable-knit
jumper I think it's really lovely I
don't have many jumpers that have a
round neck either so it's a bit of a
change for me but the quality is
absolutely gorgeous and I love the
creamy fabric round it mean to white
it's a perfect kind of very light cream
so this is the last piece and I realize
that it's a lot of new stuff guys but
for New York Fashion Week I was going to
have a lot of new outfits to shoot for
the blog to shoot for the channel and
also I'll be wearing these all the way
throughout spring so this is everything
that is brand new
I'm sure you'll see more of them in
upcoming videos as well but please do

outfit of everything that I showed you
