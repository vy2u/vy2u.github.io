really well seeing as I've already
filmed two of these videos in this
little mini series I'm doing around
Fashion Week actually technically outfit
you could probably say three videos I
filmed my New York Fashion Week outfit
so I wore I found my what I wore to
London Fashion Week
I then filmed get ready with me for
Milan Fashion Week so I'll leave those
all linked down below if you've not seen
them off on the screen now within the
cast if you don't have a little luck but
this time I started show you what I wore
in Paris just to kind of round off the
whole little mini series of any of you
guys whose karma is two guns from Paris
you might have liked to see what I was
wearing exactly so I thought I would do
this videos too and if you stick around
he'll end I thought seeing as I bought
something in Paris this was a perfect
video scan it put that into so sit
around the end to see what I treated
myself to when I was in Paris so for the
first part with my Paris trip I was
actually with the deal team with your
beauty team I went out to Paris with
them as you're having a big
international event and they're also
showing us a sneak peek as their new
prompt and Volume Mascara so that was
amazing through doing all of that so a
lot of the outfit self wearing but
actually deal but I wore a few things
around those outfits that are kind of
like to mention the first was a really
easy piece I wore from bash bash bah
it's just a very simple red cotton and
permit for lefting in their fabric roll
neck top which again I think I was in
New York actually but it just works with
so many different acts of outfit you can
use this as a layering piece and many
things which is what I did I wore it was
a beautiful to your vest that had like
knitted roping around the front and this
gorgeous diamond shaped patterning and
it's look within the grittier so I wore
that and that along with a simple pair
of black page jeans I've worn is quite a
few times on the season you believe it
figure these but honestly they have done
me so well there are really great
classic pair black jeans very well
fitted for a loafer medium rise and
Thank You high-waisted which animal it
will go with absolutely everything so a
wart go through that and then it was the
evening at the international event where
Bella Hadid and Peter Phillips the do
your makeup artist we're kind of hosting
the event is awesomely pumped and Volume
Mascara and that evening I wore the most
amazing the Oscars it's tassels and
pinks and purples and pleated news
outlets doing quite can show you I wore
that with which needs a good iron now as
it's silky and have got crease but this
is a blue yes from Reef is a navy blue
silk top along behind neck vest our
sleeves and in the back is more of a
fabric material so it's more comfortable
fabric material back and then the silk
at the front and this looks so great
even tucked into a pair of dark blue
denim jeans with heels for date night I
love the top but actually not really
cute with the skirt this is quite a
contrast to dark shade the phone like
pretty shades I quite liked those
contrasting colors so a while back and
they also wore it with my trusty shall
be too rough seas in the baby pink and
so glad I picked these up now because I
have worn them with so many things just
like my Shelby does in the nude and the
white that you also have these go with
so many things because recorded so
neutral to add a little bit of color
okay so then I left the Dior to you
unfortunately but I did then get to meet
up with my amazing L'Oreal family as you
may know I am a loyal Paris hair and
butter so I often hang out with those
guys for Fashion Week's and Cannes Film
Festival okay outfit number one you may
have seen on my Instagram and I love
this outfit for one of my favorite
outfits from Fashion Week and it is this
skirt which you will see if you watch my
best because my ex or fall it's a silly
skirt sis Lisa's like this sandwich is
almost like gold speckles of glitter on
a golden fabric in and have this
beautiful
tulle fabric and on the bottom it's all
pleated very cute very girly in princess
like and I loved wearing this it's very
comfortable
so I rolled that now this don't diss me
I just wore this today
this means the waters gonna cook around
it but honestly I've got so much juice
out with this top this jumper switch
from Topshop I don't think feel like
buying a second one of things maybe in a
different color because they're so great
and they go
so many things I loved awareness as more
of a layering piece with this skirt that
him and makes up the two styles it's
very lightweight float material
alongside it jumps in it I really like
that just position so I thought it
worked quite nicely so I wore that with
it as well then I want to outfit with a
trusty pair of Chanel mules
I bought these like a year ago and they
are such a worthwhile investment I have
not stopped wearing these I wear these
on really casual days and good fittings
often got some meetings I was doing just
bits and bobs from going out I want
something to smoke in a smart suit my
jeans
i'ma wear these big favorite and with
the outfit was a beautiful strawberry
red bag which if you go along to the
Instagram post I'll try and leave a link
or link down below
I'm giving away that exact same bag and
it's like a couple more days left to go
in fact if you go now I'm sure like a
day left you can enter to win this bag I
don't have it here with me because I had
to give that particular bag back and
they re making me a brand new one it's a
full sake of showing you guys it's the
photo and competitions but it's
incredible two cups of beautiful it's
not yet out it's only out in September I
believe and you guys have a chance of
winning Guam before anyone else will
even get the house in it so I wore that
too
okay so the big event for l'oréal was a
gorgeous fig Brasserie dinner delorean
Brasserie which was so fantastic and so
beautiful planned out ourselves Emily
Canham and kosher beauty who are total
aids and you are also signed with
L'Oreal as well search fish is what I
wore the huge airbus jumpsuit that my
bestie got for me for the a soft vestige
of my 804 finally got to wear this and i
am so in love with this jumpsuit is the
most beautifully fitted jumpsuit in
Sterling
oranjee red shade and I just felt like a
princess in it and I have so many
compliments on it to make a webinar
casual I wore that with this leather
jacket which is from off save I've
missed a few times are obsessed with
this with this more Oxford shading to
each shoulder and lost 40 element around
the bottom of the elastic over in mouth
and it works really really well with
this outfit and for shoes although you
would have now to see them in the
pictures
concision suit was so long and big
covered suits but I was wearing beads
which I haven't yet shown you so I
wanted to these are a new pair of Malone
Spears and I have very similar pair in
Newell style and these instead are in a
false collective style the some of
mimics are found kind of stylish shell
is very clear very pretty in the
metallic gold silver and rose gold and
black very some of the meals are house
but these are like I said my heels and
stiletto shapes I wore those as well for
extra bit of sparkle and metallics and I
thought it go well with the red now
those for the products like Walmart and
L'Oreal Paris then I came home and I
went back to Paris again with Chanel
beauty this time so it's been a pretty
amazing in like insane month so I
thought I'll include the Chanel Paris
trip in with all of this as kind of
round off a very exciting very busy
month so there's one very special night
where we got to go and have a look at
mum as well
Chanel's apartment so still there in
Paris above the beautiful recap on
Chanel store got to go in there it's
like by invitation only so it's a very
special time and it was amazing to see
it and this is what I was wearing just
something very international and simple
but I absolutely love this inside show
you it's a really neat line it's in reef
roll neck in love in lightweight fabric
it almost feels a bit like a cotton wool
Nick it's got a real is almost bit of a
Kashmir feel to it almost
so all that with the black jeans are
before dissipation jeans because it's
such an easy one to throw on and I wall
up with my LK Bennett boots which I
finally got to wear feel like I've been
trying to wear these for a huge ears and
can't find the right outfit cozy Dolly's
there's a little bit of color the muted
coat tone is really sweet it's worked
really well with the taupe tones in the
topic as well then on one of the
evenings I've got to wear a dress that
we mean to wear for so long and I found
not to wear it we went to hotel cost in
fact we're staying at Kakaako and hotel
cost restaurant for evening and this is
what I wore
it's a stunning lilac Club Monaco dress
Farlow style and then the sleeves happy
cutouts it's almost like it covers the
shoulder section of your arm and then
cuts out with a pretty bow and it's
elastic and then iterate with mark
excuses sleeve so it's very feminine and
very pretty and this color is gorgeous
not really got anything else like Lisa
my wardrobe the thought it looks very
pretty for the evening and again I just
wore these with my Jean butyl Rossi's as
always if I really wanted to get this
into a video and show you guys and then
it was the final day in Paris and this
is what I wore so first off I want this
very pretty all synced top in this
almost love and degrades blue shade very
pretty lace work and a light mesh
fabrics is very tough lots of really
pretty details you can wear this with so
many things so I wore it with an
ordinary pair of jeans you know me I
love my jeans I love that my casual
style and with mixing out with a great
jacket and a good pair of shoes so while
it's in a trusty pethood some genes
either husband can do no wrong mainly
fit so wonderfully and they make great
fitted pair of jeans so I just have this
wonderful pair in a very simple standard
blue what they just seem to go with
everything so well though and for the
jacket the coalition the cream and then
these beautiful sleeves just make me
super happy I feel like a feature this
for my recently died feature in a
favorites video somewhere but anyway
it's finally got feature it in pictures
and I absolutely adore it all know that
for mark the mark on the back oh my gosh
I'm going to get this chat window yes I
warm up over the top love that for the
shoes for this I went with a pair of
tony bianco shoes these very much remind
me of the Yeezy boots that came out in
the green and they also do the green in
these as well I got these in beige but
they have such a great shape because
it's a small sock boot it very much fits
the entire foot and it's got a fantastic
point on the front you policy needs
everywhere like Gigi's wearing them at
Bella's wear and then so may different
model so many bloggers so I have to get
myself a pair too and to complete that
whole outfit I wore a brand new or
garite handbag this is so so pretty it's
got this very beautiful very like snake
print passing all over it in the beef
jewel tones and colors and of course it
how to use Bulgari serpentine icon kind
of on a very front office picture very
jewelry style spot actually it fits a
lot into his triple section and a very
pretty chain again very iconic for
grease trap now in this jewelry style
rope serpent threading and more of the
fabric onto the very very top and it's a
beautiful honestly Amelia could not get
enough of dispatches again love this
style you need it and yeah I agree it's
so beautiful that was the final of my
outfits literally for this whole fashion
month I mean I know Chanel wasn't
technically part of fashion month but
for me it was kind of in my mind
mentally it was kind of the end of a
really fantastic month of events and
shows and there's so many amazing things
happen so I thought I'm going to show
you all of this together so this one
feels a little bit more disjointed
because a few of your pieces I had to
send back a few other items I no longer
have or have gone back to all the Browns
and things are absolutely disjointed I
still felt I have some really great key
pieces here that I wanted to show you
guys and to finish let me show you what
I got in Paris without Sarah Chanel so
wrapped inside of this box it was such
beautiful boxes aren't name they're
always so wonderfully wrapped with the
ribbons they make it really special for
you to open it so I was like you
continue your experience outside the
store sits inside of this box I go in
the rukon bond store which is like the
first Chanel store of success for me
swear mademoiselle's apartment used to
be and with it being such a fantastic
multi I saved away some money and
thought I would treat myself to a new
Chanel bag because I don't own a Chanel
bag that is of a large enough size for
everyday or for just to take more around
with me so that's what doesn't look out
for and this
it's a beautiful bag that I found it's
so pretty
I'm all sort of it's good to touch it
almost because this is cream shade
however this top it is in caviar leather
so shouldn't wear too badly and here
again is a caviar leather which is in
the quilted passing again it should be
okay the sides and the bottom are in the
moss smooth leather so must be a little
bit more careful but overall I'm not
going to pressures in the day we buy
back to use and lots of skin relieved
nests in the box
I'm totally smitten with it's quite a
beautiful chain strap I hadn't seen this
style of bag before so I'll be
completely honest with you I'm not
really sure it's called so I'll try and
leave a link down below and I've named
in love what this is because it can also
cave in a beautiful blue shade and while
muted maybe showing a red and black by
self cream I don't know any other cream
on light colored bags and it was just
extra extra special so it's a big treat
so please let me know down the comments
for what you think of this little Chanel
bag I'm so smitten with it so that's it
guys I really hope you enjoyed this
whole series kind of looking back at my
outfits how I sell them what I talk to
different countries for the different
fashion weeks it's been really really
