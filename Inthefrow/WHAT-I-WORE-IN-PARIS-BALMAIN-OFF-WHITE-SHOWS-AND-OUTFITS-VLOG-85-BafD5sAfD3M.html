match with it and obviously I'm wearing
my my jacket over the top as well and
then to go with the color scheme I've
gone for my gold and white jean Vito's
which I thought work pretty well and
then my little Chanel bag I don't have a
bellman bag or bomb on shoes so you have
a man and you have everything but I love
this outfit it's very nice it's out

though to buy into bow man without it
costing the earth and more I think this
t-shirt it's about 175 yeah it's not
cheap but it's not it's not as much as
my why sell t-shirts purse it's got a
lot of details of the button it looks
really really lovely with this hmm we

and like foil off and I don't even know
what fabric they were but they were
absolutely beautiful like holographic
and shining and it was amazing really
kind of like space-age in some ways and
then there was lots of denim pieces very
kind of typical bar man but a bit more
kind of like elevated for the season
absolutely beautiful items and the boots

little bit hard for the models to walk
in unless it's cuz they're on carpet
