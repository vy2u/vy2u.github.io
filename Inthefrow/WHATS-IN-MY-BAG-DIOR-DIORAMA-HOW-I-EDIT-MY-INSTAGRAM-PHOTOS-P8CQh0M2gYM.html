long overdue video actually I haven't
filmed one of these what's in your bag
videos for a long time plus I thought
I'd kind of mix in with a what's on my
iPhone as well seeing as my iPhone is
permanently inside my bag when I'm out
about kind of felt like it was quite
propria to maybe look at my phone as
well so that's what we're doing today
gonna have a look at my bag the bag I
use most what's inside it and also a
little peek onto my iPhone so as you
probably know and as you probably guess
this is the bag that I've been using the
most recently it's my most recent
purchase it's my most loved bag right
now absolutely Dora and it's perfect for
the season as well and this burgundy
shade love the silver hardware I've kind
of fit all this before but yeah she's
not seen in me all the videos you may
not see this before it's a D or D Arama
bag in the Bergen Yan shade which is
almost like an ox blows raspberry shade
and it's in the medium-sized there is a
larger version of this and also smaller
version but this is in the medium size
which is a perfect size for me and
everything like to fit in it so this is
the bag from the front with the kind of
signature Dior patterning on it which
goes around to the back in this ribbed
effect on a textured leather as well so
let's see what's inside
now inside it's actually really pretty
it's like a baby blue finished just
inside which I thought that's really
gorgeous and it's kind of like a satin
fabric apparently it's the same fabric
they use for their satin ribbons
that's quite cute it also has Christian
Dior Paris here in silver as well okay
so I purposefully didn't want to kind of
go through this too much and there are
things I take in and out of my bag quite
often because the things I use everyday
but this now is generally how my bag is
every single day when I go out I wanted
to keep it kind of true and not clean up
too much okay so I'll start off with
everything else apart from my phone so I
always have to shoot in here because
when I run out the house I usually
always get really nervous at some point
so I have a packets of tissues or
eyelets let's take off a few piece of
toilet paper take it with me just in
case I get a little really
so always always issues and now let's
just everywhere there is a pack of
mentos in here with one mint left I
bought these I think in Boston
Sacramento they always have minutes like
my friends know I'm the one with the
mints why I always keep saying to Alex
recently
why don't you buy mints and then I can
have one is that if you always asking me
for a mint literally no one else of a
house of apart from me because you never
know let's get the boring thing about
the way so I've got a pair apple
headphones Apple earphones
I still think these are the best I've
tried a few of the ones and none of them
ever sit in my ears quite as nicely as
the Apple therefore so I always have
them like boring cab journeys or boring
train journeys or anything like that
especially on planes actually have a
pack of Rennie's in here because I get
really bad indigestion sometimes and I'm
really about Tom especially more flights
I think it's how your stomach expands on
flights get a really bad stomachache so
let's have a little pack of rellies just
in case then in here I have the Mac eye
pencil in coffee I must just need this
for little like updates to my eyeliner
throughout the day I must have been out
recently and use this and taking it with
me I don't generally have this with me
but it is a great eyeliner I've got a
couple lipsticks in here first one is a
liquid lip Velvet in number 9
thorn rose it's where my absolute
favorite liquid lipsticks right now it's
the most beautiful consistency it
literally is like velvety super soft
smooth finish on our lips and this shade
it sounds like a muted deep rose thorn
rose it's stunning
I want to obsess what always heads up
with little shops the one I'm wearing
now is Anastasia Beverly Hills
anastasiya as little people say and fast
Beverly Hills pure Hollywood it's just a
very classic nude it just soft suits me
I have to ELISA I'm wearing one today
and in here I also have another Burberry
actually the Burberry new beige very
kisses sheer which is such a beautiful
nude that goes on with a very sheer
shine not really shine more glossy Sheen
finish this makes your lips look a
little bit more kind of pouty fresh and
look she was so beautiful and yeah
that's such a good one I think I mention
this before but it's kind of thing you
could pull out your bad if you have a
mirror you'd be able to apply this to
lips and use the kind of shade it is and
the kind of sheer consistency it would
always look great
got my keys on here I have this is for
the newest thing you never seen before I
got this in Canada when me Leon Carly
and Alex went to Canada it's just lovely
wooden maple leaf with the Canadian flag
in a little heart on there I still have
my Japanese keepsake that I got from
Japan that I'm pretty sure this means
hope all of either way it's meant to be
nice little charm and I still have my
key ring these have been in all of my
what's in my bags I still have them
Edward milk tink earrings that does have
these really lovely little messages on
them that my mum got me I love that okay
in here I've also got a Beauty Blender
that I keep inside in a little case now
because you always have concealer on
this and I generally always throw in a B
to blend it into my bag whenever I go
out the amount of bags now that have
like smudges of concealer inside them
because I've had my sponge in there
this is totally ruining them so I'll
starting now putting it back inside the
beauty blender case also to keep it much
cleaner as well I mean I have that it's
pretty gross obviously I do wash it
every time before I start using it so
not too big a deal but just keeps it
much more sanitary and stops ruining my
bags and I have that alongside the
iconic London palette so I generally
always have this in any bag that I take
out because it's got quite a few
different shades in here so I use these
now for topping up my concealer and
general areas on my face it's not too
thick or cakey but it's got quite a high
finish coverage so I'll use this one the
most especially for my concealer this
one for a bit more brightening this one
for highlight is for Thought contouring
I always have that a tube of Carmex I
need a new one this is literally just
about to run out it's my one and only
and also in here I've got a cafe Nero
card why you want thing on it the shame
I have about 100 I think of like one
loyalty card set everywhere I've also
got my driving license and I've got a
couple of cars
in here and the only other thing that's
inside here now is just a receipt from
your which is for a pair of heels that I
had them repair for me and they message
of the day say they're ready so I've put
this in my bag ready so I don't forget
and that when I go into Dior I at least
will have the receivers make our outside
one bill to pick them up so that's from
there too otherwise it's completely
empty now and the only other thing left
in it is my phone so this is the iPhone
6s plus I would love to get the seven
and thinking of maybe updating it in a 7
but to be honest this is actually quite
fairly new it's only about a year old
and it still works perfectly well the
case that I have on it is the biggest
cobson ever honestly the idea of putting
a mirror on the back of your phone it's
awesome son I thought about but never
realized just how much I need it until I
had it now I don't really need another
mirror I mean I know I like having this
because this is a huge mirror but for
like lipstick application and everything
else throughout the day this is so handy
I can't even explain but it's from a
brand called zero gravity it says inside
of here honestly I want to get into one
of this because it's a little bit a
little bit bruised and battered now on a
bit dirty and quite often I have my
phone on me in my pocket and if I'm ever
thinking it's my lipstick here
it's my mascara round it's my hair in
the right place I can quickly just do
this and put it back and it's you know
you're all good again so honestly I
can't tell you how hard it is things to
show you I'm missing the background
on the background I've got a picture of
me and Alex my lock screen is some
pretty peonies as well which I really
really like so let's see I'm still
trying to get used to this new update
weird okay so this is my phone generally
the first screen I have everything that
I use every single day second screen are
things I use now and again not as much
yeah that's kind of generally it so and
also have messages mail phone and
Twitter along the bottom like priorities
things I always go to but then honestly
things on this main screen I generally
use every single day so we've got like
photos calendar
camera at calendar I could not live
without his phone's calendar everything
that I do and everything that's in my
diary goes into the iPhone diary Alex is
hooked up to my diary my managers I hope
took to my diary just so everyone knows
where I am what I'm doing and it's
actually really handy that way but this
also Maps could not live without map so
I'm constantly looking at where I am or
where I'm going and I find maps it's by
far the easiest one I don't care what
google map says matches the easiest one
notes I had loads of notes in my phone I
like to keep notes on absolutely
everything whether it's ideas of what to
fill ideas a block blog post to write I
keep everything inside note so I knew
that like daily Dropbox I like to use
it's just a good way to get pictures
from our laptop to my phone if I want to
type in scramming anything Instagram of
course my pulling my favorite app
because Instagram so if you don't follow
me already I'm just in the fro on
Instagram I mean yeah I absolutely love
Instagram it's a shame the new algorithm
is hit it's just not quite the same as
it used to be so we'll enjoy I put a lot
of things until I Instagram some people
that I follow I'll show you a few that I
love little underscore magpie one Amy is
a babe Megan lv2 a little bit in fact my
whole feed on this ground will be people
I absolutely love so I follow 367 and
generally I will like everybody's
picture that comes up because I'm
totally in love with their profiles like
I don't follow people that I'm not going
to like and I think it's just nice to
like people's pictures I don't think
people want to like photos anymore
you know a feel couple years ago people
are so into Instagram and they'd like
and like and like I feel like people now
scroll they don't like anymore and it's
a bit of shame it kind of ruins the
point of Instagram which is about
engagement and chatting with people and
showing your appreciation for pictures
so generally I will go through my feed
and like every single picture because
all the people are follow I pretty
awesome so I'm Jen M is amazing Javita
Russy because why would I not follow my
Queens
song of style army song Danny's song
right below my gosh that's a beautiful
picture done it is awesome
sunita there's cat messin looking
absolutely incredible doing yoga so just
a few but honestly if you have a look at
my following listen this might be some
nice people there for you to have a look
at but Shazam if you never heard of
it's such a good app if you're kind of
out in a cafe you're like what is this
song I love it you just press your Sam
let your phone listen to the song and it
will tell you what song is on it's just
still one of the best apps out there
what's up obviously I use snapchat I've
not snapped too much - very actually I
did a little bit of me filming and
filming the chatty bit and then that was
me my bad collection if you not watch my
bad collection I think that was my last
video so I'll leave the link down below
but I just filmed all about my bags
might been about 30 in there so have a
peaky flight if you'll follow me already
a promo snapchat is just in the fro in
fact I'm in the fro on every single
channel there is so you can find out
when Google Chrome is my one only app I
use Google Chrome for everything Spotify
as well Spotify is like when my absolute
favorite apps like every single day I no
longer use iTunes I don't use Apple
music I only use Spotify and although
I've bought so much old CDs and music in
the past I now just listen to digital so
I had a Spotify membership and I just
use it for everything I've learned to
playlists I'm pretty sure that I'm in
the France but I fire as well if you're
market by playlist and then I've got a
couple of apps that I use for my
pictures so and I've got vseo vsco cam
so it'd be SEO is just great because you
can kind of lay out your Instagram and
sort of see how your pictures gonna look
side by side but it also lets you filter
pictures with some really great filters
in here so it's all about finding which
filters you love the most is I mean
there's loads you can buy they're not
too expensive but I generally will go
into this first and pick a filter of
that so the Photoshop Express which is
another amazing app it's just like
Photoshop on your computer but kind of
like a dog down iPhone version and you
can take any picture I'm you're going up
it petroi and this one again and it's
just got lots of things to do to it as
filters or they're kind of corrective
things so you can reduce the noise and
if it's quite grainy or you can add
shadows in if you like or you can add
vibrancy and make it super saturated
like as low as you can do on here great
so use that as well I think
my own little in the throw button which
goes straight to my blog so it's just
for mornings when I wake up I've already
had a blog post go alive I can check the
boots already on there so if you are a
reader of my blog you can go to Safari
and then you can go across here and just
press plus out to homescreen and then
when you press that it'll add a little
Anna fro button everything really on
here don't you so much like delivery is
amazing just for getting deliveries off
any kind of food to your door Wow oh my
god I mean everything up here in the
folders I don't generally use that's why
I folded them away
oh and depop du Pape is actually one
thing I've been using recently I've been
putting some things up for sale and
depop winter's jackets and some bags and
things run there so if you're interested
I am selling some bits on there I'm just
in the fro on deep part as everywhere
else I'll leave a link down below as
well but go and have a peek if you like
hopefully some things will be still be
left but yeah I'm on depop every day now
because I'm selling things so that's why
that's on there as well so yeah I think
that is actually everything on my farm
well apart from Twitter obviously which
again I'm just in the fro on I mean I'm
on Twitter every hour pretty much
tweeting or chatting with people liking
favoriting I pretty much try and
favorite and like everything that anyone
ever says to me because I hope to show
that Freddy so if I read it I'll like it
if I don't like it it means I haven't
read your tweets but yeah bye is
everything pretty much I hope you enjoy
a little insight into my bag and my
phone and I mean this is quite an
intimate personal kind of video in RC
coz how often do you get to go up to a
stranger house and what's in that bag
it's kind of I love watching these so

really nice waste going to see what
