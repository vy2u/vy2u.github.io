to a workout class was sweaty Betty but
he pretty soon is like in the metaphor
like bomb sculpting classes however I
mean I am going to it and my Cubs about
to arrive but literally I can barely
walk today because of the workout I did
on Friday my thighs and my bomber so
tight that I can like barely stretch
them so this might not go down very well
I have actually bought a bit makeup
because my skin is just in absolute not
great today it--and last night I didn't
put a ton of my face for that reason it
was but nothing on it but it still feels
horrible today and it was all red and I
upset and inflamed so I'd have to put
something understood get this down a bit
but you know is kind of
counterproductive but soon as I'm home
and a wife at Olaf and just have another
moisturizer day so I'm gonna poop today
I realize that it's just the way it's
feeling and it's sore and stuff but it's
not necessarily it doesn't look bad but
you'll know yourself like the way your
skin feels on a certain day can really
gonna be dictating your mood so that's
how I'm feeling today Michelle this
workout Classic will cheer me up a
little bit though but a little bit of
granola to start the day and I'm sure
that they also are having about
breakfast a dress yes this is C to set
the sweaty betting's
such abetting the footy Betty legging
set kind of cool without a taping bit so
it meant to me like bumps bottom
sculpting I don't know if it's that
sculpting on me and then it hits the top
cute it's a bit longer than a normal
sports brand it's quite thin to be
honest I really means we're doing yoga
I'm not gonna be able to do much else
with my legs
probably be able to do anything
it's really cool
so now it's time for breakfast although
I already did have some food earlier but
double breakfast today maple and poem
who are doing the food today
pretty delicious I'm just that with a
beautiful Chelsea after this work our
just it lots of other gorgeous Fitness
ladies house is a bit cold so I in my
new ski jacket so this is how lovely the
color I'll leave a link down below for
if I can still find it but I'm gonna
take it to Iceland because I've yea
bought a few things for the trip I had
quite a few people message me thank you
very much by the way for anyone that did
message me on insta stories to say the
jacket you bought is absolutely not
appropriate it's not gonna work at ox
it's absolutely freezing what I'm gonna
have to do cuz obviously with what I do
I want to take pictures of my outfit and
I want to get nice shots and it's kind
of fine I'm gonna take all my nice
things and we're just gonna have to try
Bessette taking some pictures my new hat
again guys I'm obsessed with it I really
love it and that so I thought I'd back
with you guys today these coats are
perfect for England I'm gonna definite
ate them even if I can't really wear
them outside in Iceland I can wear them
outside in London and that's the main
thing so pink coat in the back now the
only things I really need to do though
is I'm sure a picture of the itinerary
oh wow ooh
early morning oh yeah I'm being picked
up at 6:25 tomorrow that is really I
mean picked up at 6:25 tomorrow yeah I'm
gonna take two things Patricia we're in
the Blue Lagoon I think to swim my
pieces I haven't worn yet first one is
this one just plain super black but it's
more of a thong bum on it it's
flattering on and it got a really nice
low back so it's a super simple and easy
to knit
pack that and then the other I'm going
to take just in case a fancy wannabe key
me instead is this gorgeous one from
Melissa Oda bash in this peachy pink
collar quite simple on the buttons but
then the top is really pretty with these
gold straps just very cute little bikini
so I'd like to wear those jumpers I've
got my nice Rhys jumper but I want to
wear let's see so we need so dinner that
evening we're gonna need something
warmer for a bit quite chunky dinner on
the Monday night sense with something
quite chic and lovely I'm thinking of
taking this dress with me my new self
portrait one because I haven't really
had a chance to wear it out about yet I
don't know if this is going to be too
dressy throw dinner
although probably freezing what to do
maybe I could take a suit I could take a
suit and where my do your top wondering
maybe that's what I do now this is what
I'm most excited about wearing to show
you this this is the cutest cozy
cardigan it's from an Instagram brand
well natural brand as well boy they're
on Instagram the calm moms handmade and
they very kindly sent me one of these
incredible cardigans you also come in
like jumpers as well it's a kind of way
to wear it is that kind of off shoulder
vibe kind of cute you got a little cami

get a very nice little picture in this
I'm gonna take this although it's
absolutely massive for packing but needs
must I really want to get a picture now
then in terms of Dior I'm not taking
from to your closet well ever mentioned

you gotta think first up oh my god this
is a huge deal Kate absolutely amazing
Hodge how gorgeous is this look a little
bit I feel like I'm a little bit in
Harry Potter here then I'm going to wear
this and I thought this is Pacific kind
of thing can layer it over the top half
my other coats and jackets to keep me
even more warm plus it should just look
really gorgeous I hope so I'm going up

try that nope not for you you know like
Lando Calrissian it's got its own
separate case but okay no this is my
cake yeah obviously it's your case

I was going to buy this in this store
it's the most incredible do y'all roll
net and catch me roll neck I can't see
much more about it than that I
absolutely adore it I'm very very
excited to wear that and it should go
with lots of different outfits and just
so calcium you know oh that's going in
what can't be if all this color is it's
like a Moe's pink you can't really see
that it looks very grand though it's
like a berry move the movie gray

from taking that in here I also want to
take some of my own max I'm gonna take
my gorgeous gray one I'm gonna take now
in terms of shoes I have a couple pairs
now I'll probably take a couple of Dior
pairs to wear for the evenings but my
general shoes are going to be warm and
toasty ones these cute now I know these
s these are Sorel and Chloe boots
they're gonna be so nice and snug and
warm cannot wait to wear them
potentially might wear those on the
plane or I will wear these I'm gonna
