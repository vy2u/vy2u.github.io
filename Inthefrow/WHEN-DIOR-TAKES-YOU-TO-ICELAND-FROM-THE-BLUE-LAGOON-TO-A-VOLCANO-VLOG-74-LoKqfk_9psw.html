0:10 holo pink so I'm wearing
yeah I know I know it looks like this
it's okay morning guys
last night you can meet this'll hear it
I've never heard a storm quite like it
oh I mean can you even hear that oh my
god craziest winds all night so I
haven't slept all that well to be honest
two of my window is like flung open in
the middle of the night and we're
rattling around and oh god I'm very
tired today my skin is still extremely
dry it's add rice ever ever ever felt it
so it feels like it's got a crack it so
dry anyway gonna pop some makeup and go
round to Amelia's room to eat some
breakfast and then I mean I don't know
what we're gonna do today because we've
got a big load of stuff plan to do I
call it the use my Icelandic cool
adventures to do and I'm not sure
because then we're what we're gonna do
so it'll be a surprise for me and feet I
just quickly show you this foundation
just tried out the new door forever
undercover 24-hour full coverage
foundation I've ever seen this backstage
at the show in September and new it's
coming out soon so you're kinda gave us
one in the room to try and it looks
really really lovely and glowy
but also like really good coverage
forever under cover concealer which is
also really really good nothing better I
look more myself I mean this bit of hair
is crazy but I'm in no mood to comb over
herring and hey yeah it doesn't waiting
for Amelia to get ready went ahead
around there we're gonna have a little
bit breakfast so I'm back I've changed
into my much warmer gear and wearing my
thermal it's like
sweaty Betty thermal Scalia and I'm
wearing those underneath my chinos and
they're wearing this and I'm wearing a
jacket I'm also taking another knit top
with me as well just in case I get a
little bit cold the differences so that
I think we're getting like a private car
take us around from place to place so it
won't quite be as cold as safe we're on
a coach it'll be a lot of times we'll
see things from the car rather than a
coach so we don't have to get out all
the different pit stops it should be
good so don't have to get as cold so I'm
hoping that won't in quite as many
layers as I would if we were doing it
like our own my coach by the way if you
can hear this noise about the window
shaking that's what I had all night all
night I could hear that because two of
the windows had flung open and I didn't
realize because it was like dark I could
hear with his rattling and I thought
maybe it was Windows in their frames but
no it wasn't it was open window
however I've just open it myself cuz I'm
bloody poor little body thermals nice
warm heated rave I might know get me out
of there ready
I am cozy cozy warm and I hope I hope it
stays that way around
I feel very warm right now though we
will see see grey and pink I'm gonna
have got a great hat we just took a
quick pit stop to get some pictures he's
not like people around here gun iconic
landscape

were got to be super beautiful
I am so excited for some lunch

the greenhouse it's meant to really
gorgeous we've been promised to I'm very
very hungry
I'm very excited to soup aunt is not
three different types of organic smart
days are in the sea
oh all tomato soup I think oh it's old
tomato plants I think as now you're we
were saying so they make lots of
different tomato soup that's really kind
of giving me the heebie jeebie you know
it's making me itch you know which one
is the Queen yeah wow it's huge
big big big one this is so interesting
so this greenhouse creates like 20
percent of the tomatoes and Iceland I
mean how cool and I was just looking and
they literally have these little bag

pulled the vines and make this cool at
looping system so the nothing's on the
floor now cool what an innovative idea

helicopter around this morning fingers
crossed that the weather stays nice so
that we can do that just had a shower

they come and deliver your room service
it was very awkward to both parties this
is why I've ordered this morning I've
got the overnight oats with almond milk
and mango I've got a latte I had a latte
yesterday it was one of the best coffees
I've ever had and then I've got some
avocado and toast as well this isn't

nice they made it for me so this is what
I'm gonna eat now quickly I'm really

things I think I may have ever done
Josefa do bookings trip I would never
have ever thought to get a helicopter
over Iceland and I wasn't sure what we'd
see but that was one of the best things
out everything I've done it one of the
best things I've ever done honestly it
was just stunning and with the weather
and I mean they also do these trips in
the summer but there's no ice up there
so it were very very different whereas
with us doing in the winter with all the
snow and the gorgeous like sunrise
pinkie peeking over the mountain it was
just absolute like until it was like if
you're like heaven

recommend it enough if you're coming to
