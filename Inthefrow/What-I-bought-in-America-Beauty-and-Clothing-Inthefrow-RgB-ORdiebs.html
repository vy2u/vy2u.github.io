together because I always love knowing
what other people thought when it been
away and with America being a pretty
cool country comes to buying things
having pretty cool brands I love to
watch these kind of videos so I figured
I put this together for you and show you
exactly what I picked up in the States
I've just been away for three weeks on
the west coast America is Trek America
and it was awesome it's so good and I
had to really hold myself back when it
came to buying lots of things because I
could have gone crazy well as he stopped
sorted by that much I feel quite good I
bought a lot more the last time I went
although that was ten weeks isn't me
three weeks but so I think I did pretty
well so I'm sure you the bit of Bob's
then I got I'm just gonna add a little
disclaimer none this is bragging by the
way this is just because I love watching
these kind of videos or not to show
everyone what I got because some people
might have been interested in what I
might have picked up in the US will
start with beauty because American
Beauty stuff it's still exciting where
should I start start with things I got
on the way there I got myself the top
rod brass sculptor this is in the core
chest not a really perfect brow
applicator I mentioned in my last
favorites matching favorites but it's
such a great applicator I got it a
little bit tax off but I think it's
around 30 poems quite pricey I know but
it does work really really well so
you also picked up the Mac prep and
prime this is in the shade light boost I
wasn't sure if I'm use it but I really
wanted it I love it I find it is perfect
for applying go up a concealer and into
the triangle but if your eyes to really
brighten and boost and I'd like oh gosh
yeah so yeah love this and it's around
16 pound think okay I've got two of
these a little yo s now this I'm not
open because I've got another one
knocking around some place see me
separate with a call ALS little lip
balms in this really cute little little
egg it's really quite hydrating and
moisturizing actually I thought it'd be
a bit of fat but actually works quite
nicely there in beautiful beautiful
sense of his raspberry pomegranate which
is really nice very pada granny and the
pink one they do what you also have what
you can't find is a really lovely
strawberry sorbet I think it is and I
love that really fresh bright so yeah
recommend nose and the right two dollars
50 something silly I went on a massive
hunt for wet and wild while I was there
now I know wet wild is often sold in
Walgreens so I look two more greens and
the pallets I wanted was sold out
everywhere and then just happen to
stumble upon a little place called I
think it was Monterey out in actually a
really cute little seaside place and I
just happened to look into a store and
they had a what a wild area and I found
them my favorite palettes be walking on
eggshells palettes I've musics before in
a video makeup tutorial and loads of
people love these bad boys
they're great we have a crease color a
brown color and an overall eyelid color
and the colors are so neutral and
wearable to those that's in the walking
on eggshells point and I also saw
another one which is in silent treatment
and this is a sort of taupey brown shade
all over the eyelid a dark brown and
gold glitter crease color and a light
pale beige brow bones I thought they are
around generally around $3 Beach and
there's some of the best Palin's ever I
also picked up the color tattoo in bad
to the bronze
I seen se I stayed for Mexico and talked
about this and yeah just looked awesome
this runs kind of gel eye shadow it's
really pigmented and perfect for adding
a shadow at the top I think that was
probably around $6 I also got the
Maybelline eye studio I don't know if we
do these hip over here or not but I like
the colors and this is in legendary
lilac so this has got some really pretty
shows yeah that's around $6 yeah see I'm
not you've no Felicity things the ex I
was just saying this video got the
Loreal infallible eyeliner this is in
just feeling like a highlight show you
like this gold I thought it'd be great
for when I do a really neutral eye in
the water it's
the golden golden with a hint of pink
shade and it goes on really really
easily and beautifully that was again
around six dollars then I went in
Sephora I got the Anastasia brow with
the Amalfi pipe talked about this I had
to I got it in chocolate again and okay
so mr. tomforde
a bit thinner and one end from spoolie
and the other end you've got a pencil so
many people rave about how brilliant
this is I know it's gonna be great just
for brows perfectly so I think that was
around twenty twenty dollar fee so I
also got the Loreal BB cream the magic
skin beautifier BB cream and I got this
in media actually I played around a
couple of different ones we have I need
you but seem to be pretty close for me
so it comes out white
comes out white and then it changes
color according to your skin tone and
corrects it and all that stuff so yeah I
thought when I'm talent this will work
pretty well and there's somebody to try
it out again I don't if we're doing this
in the UK probably dig but I just wanted
to get anyway I think it was around
eight he does and finally finally for
the makeup I got to the Bobbi Brown
creamy concealer sat in ivory
these are usually around $30 but I got
it one of those cool shops that do
things like discount it so this was the
ivory one and you get the ivory
concealer and then a yellow toned powder
to sort of blotter on the top it's keep
it set all day and again little mirror
in there boom and this was I think this
was around $18 or something so I was
like yes I didn't have to get this and I
really loved it so far I'm really loving
existence' so yeah I quickly went
through the clothes because otherwise
it's gonna be a really really long first
farm forever 21 I picked up these little
shoes see a lot of people wearing these
kind of found the style knockoffs but I
really love the way that the leather is
textured and this style boot was thick
and white and wax on it before I go with
loads of stuff to look really quite
trendy and cool so got those and they
were about 20 dollars but these little
shorts which I adore in a really light
washed denim with lace down both all
around the edges and so much they're not
too high up on the bum either so not too
bad
got these from an awesome store in hate
as great in San Fran called sway chic if
I can find them on a website I will
leave the link hopefully I can but
they're just a bit really really nice so
I got those and they were like $20
from forever21 again I got this little
top it says Barbie a lot of people sauce
call me bit the barb and I'm gonna say
it's an insult because it was quite a
connect so I got they slip tiny crop
super wearable and it was around $12 why
not then I went to American Apparel
which I just love in America because
everything in America is around the same
price but in the equivalent dollars so
whereas a jacket over here is 550 pounds
over there it's like $45 so it's much
cheaper when you exchange I've got
myself a pair of easy jeans in the very
light blue there on the American
parallel rail of defective products so I
look over them and I couldn't see what
was defective and that's the woman
issues like to find something efficacy
it's used as a drop stitch that's like
great so I've got these like $30 and the
meant to be about 70 over here I think
what they fit really beautifully and
yeah they're a big favor the moment you
let me know love those I picked up this
hoodie in a mint because he can never
have too many I'm happy to pass hoodies
so easy to throw on all the time now I
got chocolate down the front of this and
it hasn't come out so I'm gonna have to
re wash it and hope that it goes but yes
I $45 it's so easy to wear
Big Love that's it but I think it's a
pretty well what you think three weeks
up not too bad burn in mind that my
suitcase was already around 25 kilos or
something ridiculous don't know how I
got away with that bring that forward
down back without anyone asking me for
more money don't know but it I couldn't
even left my suitcase myself I can't get
too much stuff but I did get a love and
it was mostly beauty products hours to
get a little bit cheaper than I would
have gotten P so a lot of things you'll
be able to get in the UK and I'll leave
