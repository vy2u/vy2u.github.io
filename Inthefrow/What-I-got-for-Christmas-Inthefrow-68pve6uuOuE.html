you've all had incredible Christmas I
had a really really great Christmas with
friends and family lots and lots of food
lots of drinks lots of family time so it
was just really really perfect this year
and really hope you guys had a really
special Christmas - I definitely want to
film this video as it was extremely
highly requested I even put a Twitter
poll out in the day I said which video
would you like me to film next and this
had over 2,000 votes I think people say
me really wanted to see this so I
figured I'd put this one together for
you plus it's my favorite kind of video
to watch
I've already this morning already I've
been through Suzy's tomorrows Helens and
a few others as well because I really
love these I didn't have anything
specific that I really really wanted so
all these presents are just what my
family bought makes it thought I would
like and they've done extremely well
everything is awesome I am so so so
grateful for everything that they've
bought me it's extremely generous of
them so I guess I might as well just get
right into it I'm gonna start off with
the first present that mom got me that I
knew I wanted when she asked me what you
want nothing this is the only thing I
can think of that I really need for me
now except she bought me a slow cooker I
just wanted something super easy to use
that I could just run below and
ingredients in and meets leave it all
day while I'm working get to it night
and I've got an awesome stew or an
awesome casserole or just some
incredible food that I'm just ready to
dig into so I thought a slow cooker
would be a really good option and I got
a few friends that have them and love
them that was for me and Alex before the
Fluxus Thank You month and to go with
that my brother was very kind enough to
buy us a essential slow cooker cookbook
gone by Lana brush really really great
recipes in here like different curries
you can make Thai green curry absolutely
loads in here but I would also have to
know if any of you have any incredible
recipes that you know for your slow
cooker please do leave them down below
in the comments
love to know anything that's easy to
make but also delicious please do leave
me your tips because we're really
getting into this now
my brother was also very kind enough to
buy me itself just about your ticks I've
been going at spending in my favorite
store luckily for the sake of my diet I
guess I didn't realize that in chocolate
this year I said to my mom please don't
get any chocolate but she did get me a
little tiny start as my kind of little
Christmas Eve gift she always gets a
little gift for Christmas Eve and she
got me this which looks delicious
my best mate Rebecca has a fiance who is
American and he brought about a big bad
old Reese's Pieces cups and we've
already gone through quite a lot of
these so wish me luck in terms of edible
substances Alex's sister and his mum
were also very kind enough to buy us
some bottles of Prosecco
because Prosecco is my fav if you didn't
know already also from a mom I got this
key that the hot chocolate set called
hook me original hot chocolate wacky
whisk I love this risk okay so cute
little tiny whisk and inside here is the
luxury hot chocolate
one night when it's made quite cold and
I wanna kind of chill out watch the film
maybe do some work with a film on it
making myself this I'll forgot this this
really cute little set for the house
which is Cook's pantry flavored oil
dipping set where she got this from and
it's got three different oils in it with
little plates once the chili infused oil
once busted open the green olive oil at
one is garlic infused oil I mean I it's
law stuff like this it's a bread with
cheese we have port and this is from my
mom my stepdad and it's a chalkboard
blackboard I've been really wanting one
of these a really rustic vintage esque
style one it's got the tube holes and
I'm gonna put some ribbon through not to
hang it up with and my mama stepped up
knew that I really want to wear these
for the kitchen because I want to kind
of put on my Monday we have a Thai green
curry Tuesday by having beef however you
know and kind of like write out each day
so we know and wanna hang it in the
kitchen
so we know exactly what we want to be
tonight we just so we can stick to meal
plans a little bit better
and I absolutely adore this I think it's
just it's one of a kind it's a one-piece
he can't bias an Ikea you know it's just
really really special I'll leave the
link down below to Thomson I want design
because it makes so many gorgeous pieces
like if you are after anything in what I
have a desk so it's made by exact same
company so I'll leave a link down below
we can go and have a lot could hopefully
find something you like but yeah this is
on there love it
the one thing I did ask for when it came
to sugary treats was Uncle Joe's Mint
balls have you ever heard of these if
not you may not have ever visited the
north but Uncle Joe's meatballs have a
factory in Wiggins they're a Wiggum
based brand but they're so delicious so
just like hard mint balls go to his
nipples but they're so good that like
they fit my favorite sweets ever so I
got me this in the big big pack of them
to get through my mom also bought me
these socks from sea-salt Cornwall cabin
socks these are the fluffiest things
ever felt in my life like oh my god it's
kind of weight to my feet in they're so
cute I love these kind of socks around
the house I wear these soft slipper
socks more than I west like this I just
like something that's really cozy so
yeah she got me those my mom also bought
this little candle as a pomegranate
scented candle from Paper Chase actually
it's very much smells like pomegranate
Noir from Joe Maloney naturally so if
you're looking for something a little
bit cheaper this might be good to go for
but it's a really pretty candle has
these markings on it like little bird
cages
it's most gorgeous I'm gonna have that
on my desk and also simple boxes for the
speak to that it comes in and one was so
cute this year as well she bought me and
Alex both a coloring book and these the
most beautiful clone books I've ever
seen I don't know they make pulling
books like this so this is one she got
for Alex called the magical City and the
sign it's got loads of really awesome
huge illustrations it's a really cool
book and for me she got me at the
enchanted forest
and again it's just like really pretty
often symmetrical pattern
he must go through the color and she
said she said she'd got them all so that
we get off the computers and we can sit
together with a drink and enjoy it too
this time are we color she's so she's a
so sweet and thoughtful so she also
bought some coloring pencils too 24
coloring pencils if you ever seen the
present more adorable not love her she's
the cutest
then off my dad I got this gorgeous
cushion from next its embellished this
little bead work through this so it's
nice and textured and cotton is also
really pretty it's almost like grainy
cartoon with different threads running
through it but it's really love if
someone had this on the bed I think this
is from next next beaded caution and
then my dad must have must have got me
this and this really really struck me as
being a really thoughtful gift first of
all this bag is awesome I mean I travel
a lot and having travel bags with me
something I have like I have so many
when I go traveling I have one I have a
travel bag for makeup one for bath
products or hair products one for things
like mosquito repellents are sort of
thing and this is some really great size
travel bag it's wrong boots I believe
yeah boot skyline beauty bag is called
so on the front of this it's a white
clean material first of all and on some
here you've got Big Ben you've got the
Eiffel Tower
you've got Statue of Liberty and this is
loads of landmarks like Rome Pisa Italy
India
there's loads of really cool landmarks
in here so it's beautiful so straight
away I was really drawn to the colors of
that little cute but then inside they've
collected together loads of little
miniatures for me so there's before hair
shampoo and conditioners toothpaste and
here's a hairspray with a deodorant as a
body wash and there's a cleanser and
it's the fact they've put this together
for me themselves of like it's a travel
case because you know how much I travel
it was just really
really falafel it really really got to
me so yeah thank you so much
my dad always likes to get as a joke
present too so he got me a Merry
Christmas toilet roll which is so random
and it is so my dad like what I
definitely should have expected this but
you just he was laughing his head off
when he gave it me he was loving it as
though yeah awesome they also bought me
a really cute pair of pajamas these are
really sweet with Diaz ahna little
hearts in red and white and then the top
it's red long-sleeve with the same print
on the front this really cozy cute
little pajamas he's it from anyone I
don't even realize if I'm did close
today in what they must do but yeah
really sweet so I'll be cozying up in
those and from next he also bought many
super cozy leggings which I've never
seen before but I've got fleece lining
in them for extra warmth I mean I don't
really wear tights much but these are
Mulligan's and you always need a pair of
leggings now and again so yeah really
cool little present and they're very
very final piece which I'm sure you are
all waiting for is what Alex got me for
Christmas
we both got to the one special present
and I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted
but I knew that I wanted a purse so we
went shopping all over London through
all of my favorite stores and down Bond
Street trying to find a new purse to go
in my new shamash bag and wind up
stumbling upon Dior I said to the lady I
would like a navy purse in a textured
green leather and just something really
really beautiful and straightaway she
picked out this one purse and it was a
lot at first sight even Alex was like
that it's a purse it's beautiful it's
perfect it's exactly what I wanted this
is the purse it is a Christian do your
envelope wallet this is the kind of
person I always go fight always
girlfriend envelope wallet I just prefer
this style and shape it fits everything
in that you could possibly need and with
this you also have the do lettering in
the silver metal
off of the side which makes it really
really special also housed one pocket on
the outside but the beautiful thing that
really drew me to this wallet is that
the inside is bright pink
it says here Christian Dior Paris it
closes with a pop-up on the very outside
it has two card slots and then on the
inside it's got a pocket the back it's
got four sections here four cards four
sections there for carbs and it's got
the coin holder that's the kind of
person I love where you can have all of
my cards and strategically placed around
the wallet perfectly so know where to
get them from and I have space to put my
notes flush without and to kill them and
also put my coins in there so straight
away it had everything I wanted from a
wallet Plus this color is absolutely
beautiful it's exactly what I wanted
yeah so Alex generously bought me this
as a very very very special gift I feel
extremely grateful and extremely lucky
you've definitely keeper very much so so
yeah I was very very lucky this year

family my friends managed to get me a
