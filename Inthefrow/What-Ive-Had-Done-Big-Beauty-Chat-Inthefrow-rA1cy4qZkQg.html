bit of a different setup obviously you
may have watched my moving blog seem a
concern that I moved flats pretty
exciting and also I'm still playing
around from like lighting noises shoes
because we live near a lot of traffic um
so and also we only have like single
glaze for us so noise might be a bit and
shoo some hoping it's not going to be
too bad and dry so felt like it's been a
while since I've sat down and chatted I
was really wanting to chat with you guys
and talk to you about this which is this
whole video it will it sounds so much
more dramatic than it actually is but I
wanted to talk about all of my favorite
beauty treatments everything that I get
done why I'd recommend them why I get
them in the first place what it does for
me the reason I want to do this because
I've seen so many people on different
channels getting this treatment of this
treatment of this procedure done and no
ones are really kind of fluttered them
together and so like I get this isn't
this and this is why I recommend them so
I kind of wanted to pull something
together like this and tell you all
about what I have done I don't have my
own gesture coupling one is on the way
I'm really pretty little white Wang but
for now he's literally the only cheddar
in the whole flat we don't have any
dining chairs got nothing to sit on so
that's why I look kind of very regal in
this muffin chair and we're gonna start
off by talk about my favorite treatment
that I have done which is the LPL lash
lift so it's a lush lift for your
eyelashes it's like a pearl ash it's
pretty much it will take about 4 to 5
minutes it usually costs around 45
pounds as well I can get this to an in
benefit in Carnaby Street and I'm sure
so many other Psalms everywhere it's a
treatment finding faux lashes it's
literally called the LPL lash lift and
the procedure is just lie down it's a
bit like getting eyelash extensions but
you have your eyelashes killed around a
small shield
as they're called which are placed on
your eyelids and then one by one each
hairy soft pulled round you have some
solution applied for lashes which kind
of breaks down the lashes in terms of
their structure so she
quite straight lashes like I do it kind
of breaks it all down for a few like 15
minutes then you have that taken off and
then you have another solution put on
which I'm pretty sure is the one that
kind of bombs it in this new pill shape
so the three different types of killer
can get kind of smoker logical large
illogical I go to a really large curl
which is a small shield because I have
such straight lashes I need as much help
as I can get and I still don't get huge
curl with that if you got quite killer
lashes I mean wouldn't recommend going
for small and mid or a medium straightly
are I would highly recommend this going
to the full-on curl because they're not
going to do that this they're just a bit
more curls anyway it doesn't hurt it's
kind of a bit comfortable on you a bit
like takes a while but there's no pain
at all whatsoever it just quickly do
that they take off the solution they put
on a black down to softly got nice black
dyed lashes take that all off a leopard
really beautiful open separated
elongated gorgeous lashes I'm so
obsessed a song with very straight
lashes this is which they changed my
life when it comes to the way I feel
have confidence when I have no makeup on
it just really opens up my eyes as so
love it I could not recommend it and far
okay what's next
um nails so I go to dry by in London
which a lot of you probably already know
cuz I go on about ourselves so much I
absolutely love it there ladies at work
that are incredible the whole store and
salon is just really beautiful and
really boutique II just so loveliness
feels so it's kind of like my long time
to go in you girls absolutely love their
família just my nails and Jeanette does
my two nails so I always go for a
mani-pedi shellac just got mine done
I've got a very nude natural too white
ombre it just looks super cute I could
not recommend the salon enough i'll
leave the website down below there so
you can go and have a look at the prices
and see what you like
obviously if you have nail art like
Andre if you want everything little
jewels were looking for are like a
little bit extra but have a look at the
price list on the website
and next up my hair then I go to a salon
Col George Northwood George is an
amazing
amazing stylist is doing a lot of cool
things at the moment and that salon work
with red Ken and pure ology products
which I absolutely adore I found so many
products that sell on that I'm just so
in love with that's what the you thought
I had read Ken color put on my hair and
I use a lot of the shampoos and
conditioners and treatments from pure
ologists they work kind of hand-in-hand
I have a me fish does my color she is
incredible she's so kind of creative and
really quite inspiring she's really
really cool she was a lady who took my
hair from purple to white and silver and
I've been going back ever since
absolutely love it there it's a cool
cell and it just expands there it's
really awesome is a great great time if
you're looking for someone really really
new and you want something really kind
of premium for your hair they're totally
recommend it next up I'm gonna talk
about my teeth a lot of you have been
mentioning your teeth look better they
look more straight and you're smiling
more which I am and it just feels so
next you have to smile so much more
again back now at 11:12 I had braces all
through high school and I did not wear
my retainers when I got to 16 and I had
them off so I don't wear my retainers
which means that over the last 10 years
my teeth have just moved back and
created a bit mess it's something I've
always struggled with especially being
on camera and editing myself constantly
all I could see was my teeth and it got
to a point where some people were
noticing it and mentioning it and saying
oh you've got horrible teeth you know
how people can be sometimes I decided to
enquire and do some research and found a
lingual orthodontist in London City
London London lingual orthodontics
clinic it is an amazing dentist called a
thief - yeah - he's amazing really
really great guy he's loved leg and like
to see here my name's like we can
definitely make a massive massive change
here with lingual braces so lingual
braces are like a train track braces put
on the very back your teeth which is why
you can't see them it's not like I've
got anything in my mouth but it's also
the cause of my list and so many people
again I don't know why people think it's
appropriate to point
soare speech impediment but they do so
yes I have a list of at the moment
because of the braces and to be honest
I've always had a little bit the list
because of the race issue have happened
past so what people speak the way they
speak it's a natural thing it's not
things that they can help I know a lot
of other people that have lisps it's
just something about their character so
this is me now so at the moment I have a
quite a I've got more of an extensive
list at the moment because I literally
have had to kind of learn to speak with
these big pieces of tiny pieces actually
add metal at the back of my teeth but it
kind of ops it messes with your speech
so because of that my teeth moving I'm
starting to feel so much more confident
now with much more straight teeth I just
feel so much more kind of at ease
showing them off so um I've probably got
another years worth of wearing these and
I will be doing what posts and a full
video all about them so it's a treatment
I have never heard of before until I
started to research and so many people
have said to me like I'd love to know
all about it so I will be doing a full
video all about it really really soon
obviously students are kind of our fans
and tell you about aftercare and how
they came off and how everything's been
though I guess can I give you the whole
picture so yes so that's another
treatment that has done another cool
treatment I had last week actually I had
laser red vein removal that was with a
what would you call my beautician
I guess called Debbie Thomas and this
was in her practice in Chelsea Chelsea
clinic and I literally had thread veins
lasered off my face in terms of pain not
too painful if you can't laser hair
removal it's just the same it's just
like to me it feels like you have an
amped on your skin with a tiny little
elastic band it's just flicking its lips
like a Tully's appetizer you can barely
feel it just like think think you know
and go all the way along to a place my
house some in my cheek in this area and
they were quite prominent too especially
and she went all along those to get rid
of them I love her she on this cheek
and also I had a few just going into the
entrance of my nose as well and she's
out there those were a little bit more
kind of like
and but again Betty Bob and painful it's
not something that you definitely like
oh my gosh I can't get their doing cuz
it's so painful it's not at all but if
you're the kind of person who has thread
veins we face a quite quite prominent I
would very very much recommend it you
want to go in and have literally spread
rain removal you know where they are you
want to get rid of that about 15 minutes
it'll take it's around only 25 pound or
going for like full hour and she'll
literally get rid of everything on your
face your lips at about so if it's a
pigmentation mark or spots been really
bad and it's caused an awful blemish or
if you've got kind of freckles and
things that joying sheeple it sure can
do anything with later it's amazing like
if you've got scars and things from acne
it'll really help to kind of reduce
those or remove that I'm not a complete
expert on this but I definitely look
into it but for me it's a suffering
things I wanted to try it out and I'm so
pleased
the results are considered so happy
massages I live for deep tissue massages
so work from home on constantly clinic
show computer and i cannot recommend lms
salon more it's beautiful start ways
it's kind of like ship store it's online
caster cool i think it's kind of right
near the Victoria's Secret store on
Street and it's as beautiful in there
lovely ladies that working as well see
feel really at home and really concealed
and the massage rooms are beautiful so
highly recommended massage and I also go
there or benefit Carnaby Street to get
my brows dyed and just like she like to
go super dark for my brows like a dark
brown like down now so I get them done
but if it kind of Street and I also get
them done Eddy LMS so on and it's
literally just a brush of dye three
brows leave that on for about five
minutes wipe it off and it's done super
quick super easy and quite often when I
get and that didn't I'll also get my how
she's dyed and dark black seems you call
black blue that's like the darkest and
that takes about 15 minutes and again
it's not painful it's not uncomfortable
sit with your washes clothes they paint
it all on take it all off and then
you're good to go
I will say though with the lvl rush lift
with dyeing your hair with Dyer brows
Danya eyelashes you do need to have skin
test so make sure you go in at least 48
hours before to each place just to get a
little bit of dye popped on the back of
your neck I think it's back your neck
back the ear you could do it now and
that will make sure that you're not
going to have any kind of allergic
reaction because that's not what you
want to do especially when it's so neat
your eyes so you'll need that for each
of those treatments unless I'm going to
mention is laser hair removal I'll be
completely honest I haven't had this
done in full yet but I'm booked in to go
with pro skin clinics I think quite a
few different places in London and I've
men to go in but last time I went to go
out the legs I have broken
however I have had all the tests done
for it to make sure that I can
definitely have it done I'll see a trend
around stone and bikini line I had all
the tests so I sort of know how it feels
and it's very similar to the thread vein
removal as I said it's just like a tiny
little flap not thinking you can't live
with at all you make sure you shave
beforehand and they just run the laser
over the top and just snap snap sup sup
sup and gets rid of everything again
it's just a really cool really
innovative procedure that just means
that you can free of hair wherever you
don't want it it can really kind of
boost your confidence you know that you
can it can go out into the key here is
any kind of tap on I know that you've
not got some thunder arm hair that
you've actually forgotten to get rid of
you know it's kind of really kind of
boost your femininity and all that and
that's why I really wanted dogs facility
to get that done
again I'll leave you toss down below if
you've got to go to websites and have a
look at the prices and all that so that
was going to be with pro Skin Clinic
there's all these different places also
from brand names and try and remember
everywhere open too
so I said all details of all these
treatments are going to be let down love
out a sort of the nice face kind of
rundown on everything I really would
recommend because the amount of videos I
keep doing in black by the way to cut my
lashes done by the way I just got my
nails done I thought nice place and kind
of direct people and safe and I know
anything about 1/2 done anywhere it's
all in this video if you want any more
information about any of the treatments
leave your questions down below in the
comments and I'll try my best to get
through as many as I can in the day I
just want to be able to recommend
treatments that I love that may really
help you make you feel more confident
and potentially you may not have heard
about these things before because so
many of them
I just been introduced to it I've never
heard of so hope this could have been
helpful but also just wait to go sit
down and chat with you guys it's nice
going to be like one-to-one again
hopefully this video is okay in terms of
light and sound nothing it's a so loud
outside so I really hope you be able to
hear me I'm so sorry for not looking at
rejigging palace again but thank you so
