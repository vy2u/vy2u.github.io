is that that is brown I kind of don't
want to say we're about to go because
I'm a bit bored of saying it but we're
going to go the gym it's Tuesday now
then I took back hard yesterday bit more
chills but now we're going to go to gym
get out the way and then emails all day
come back after a little obsession so I
also someone asked me of the day why am
I going to the gym every single day and
the reason is just that because I'm home
now and I've been home mouth a little
bit I know I have can in between for a
few days but because we go on someone I
like big like week-long trips I don't
really get to go to the gym and I've
really sort of not looked after myself
that well in the past few years I
thought I went intermittently but never
really had like a full routine and I
kind of got really sick of feeling down
on myself and not feeling toned enough
and have cellulite so I decided that I
wanted to make changes and I figured the
best way to do that would be to start
eating much better I mean to - I already
eat really well but to continue with
that and to also it's really hammer the
gym so that's what I've been doing so
generally every time I go I'll do 20
minutes from the cross trainer just that
off we're just to really warm you up and
to get my legs moving and then I'll
either do a live session where I'll do
mainly glutes so like squat
hip thrusts and I'll go are like the
this is the abductor machine where you
push it out yeah I'll use like cables
and do like squats on the cables and
things like that and that's kicks and
all that on the cable machines or I'll
do an ab day so I feel like all
different ab workouts and that's really
what I do I should really work on my
upper body because I have I mean look
around
I've absolutely no muscles and my arms
collapsing no upper body strength walked
in a moment my problem area mainly is my
glutes and my bum so that's the priority
then my stomach just to try and get out
a bit more toned and then when I feel
better about those everyone else at work
you know might harm but I really enjoy
actually going every single day mix it
was a really really god I'm seeing
changes already
so I'm quite happy so that's why I'm
going every single day right and down to
work I have showered I am ready I have a
very comfortable Brora

the same positions this here very chill

definitely don't know about Alex video I
came up with like 50 random questions
into Alex I take some time to be like
some pops up and it's really really good
you've already edited it and it looks
amazing so I'll leave a link down below
to that make sure you go have a look if
you've not already seen it but I prefer
to sort of go through my night time
skincare routine just in case you want
to know at the moment I'm using objects
night restore gel drops instead of like
water drops of light gel quite like
actually it's the dry irritated and
tired eyes then I go in with a Sarah
Chapman eye recovery underneath my eyes
and my eye cream and this really helped
clear up my ex not that I had it went
within a couple of weeks of this bad boy
then I've been putting on a little bit
of the regen oils very similar to like
buy a while tiny bit on this little spot
and it's really helping get rid of it
then all over the face i'm using the
Kiehl's midnight recovery concentrate
again really rubbing it into this and
it's just really really helping all of
this so much then till i'll call that in
place i used to do your hide your life
jelly sleeping mask which is wonderful
so hydrating and just flex love it on
your skin as goes heel then of course
Carmack's I nail it and then fill my
hands I use the daddy oil on my cuticles
and then I go in with the hand chemistry
extreme hydration concentrate for my
hands every single night my little
routine Alex has to wait for me to do
every single bite but honestly I was the
saying to act before I think my skin is
the best it is ever ever beam right now
which is amazing I've never really had
that before and I think it's down to
Diskin carotene which is really good
my dermatologist who I love who have
mentioned before Bianca at B skin
clinics I've been having on the vitamin
C facials and peels and it's
yeah massively helping me and also as it
last few weeks I haven't all as much
makeup as usual and it's really really
helped so I'm really pleased and what I
thought babbling going to go to bed and
I'll see you in the morning mmm ah

cosmetics CC cream in fair and in light
under the day when I wash my brushes I
haven't even yet yet because my ex brush
it's really nice the coverage of this so
is so nice it's chewy
it's the CQC cream but it's not
extremely good coverage like this Chanel
concealer in number 20 could do with
something a bit line trash about do
realize the consistency of this through
in a creamy and I got further to the
nails premium sealer a lot more actually
however the soft matte can see no one
and done which I'm using China Beauty
belt wonder channel due to blend at
moment for my concealer looks beside
it's just perfect size bronzer from four
shapes and illuminate palette and I love
that lip so that is the issue a dulce de
leche shade beautiful matte lip cream

little Gucci sandals is really in the
mood for wearing very casual clothing
I'm going to get my nails and animal to
go into gleam special oh and pick up

best
you can't define day one but in the
maybe to glean just picked up a little
bit Postgres I have some folks here

waiting on for like over a month so I'm
excited

rose gold face I absolutely love that
the benefit girls are agreeing I love
there is someone to get my brows done
quickly sum it up and done for like five
weeks yeah you know how much for ladies
are I only ever go to benefit to my
brows don't suit Oh God just got home
and found this Fox remember that put a
little order in its called beauty I went
to a cutter half a restorative eye cream
because I've got the illuminating one
and it's good but it's really
illuminating and I wanted something
without the soft pink pearlescent tone
in it so hopefully this is a little
different and doesn't have that inner
excellent this is apparently also meant
to be amazing literally in bum bum cream
although it's meant to be pronounced
boom boom boom boom cream this have a
type of caffeine in it this meant to
really help hone your gluttonous Maximus
and make it looks great and me how cool
is is packaged in boom boom green last
but not least it's about time and I got
this modern a soft palette from a
nostalgia Beverly Hills and I also got a
new boss of phenomenal town from V
Taylor brass which is what amounts with
favorites to three week terms it's the
same as of the day we're having avocados
with crab pumpkin seeds and pine nuts we
just seemed to really like this food and
it's delicious and like this this is it
finally got my Victoria Beckham's
target pieces literally it's taken so
long to get peace through my best mate

them these trousers fit really nice
really nicely and I really love it with
this shirt acting on how come all these
course like big white cost and really
love it and I seen a picture Victoria
Beckham - full set it she looks super
cool this whole look so you know that's
what I was going for of it
I reckon seduce his favorite it's like a
little black dress with white cuffs and
how three is a little Peter Rabbit it's
on the collar it's really free I thought
it might look a little bit like what
singing call from our family now all the
get the girl yeah Polly Malecha but
Wednesday Addams but I think it's I
really like it I think it's a really
good length just with some cute shoes or
like heeled boots and summer it's really
cute quite preppy and sweet browser
looking good although very back they
need a bit of a cleaner
yeah scrubbed onto a little tiny bit
behalf it'll be fine I look great but it
