beauty related video this videos can
inspired from my second last video which
was all about what I packed much of the
Maldives and you guys really seem to
love to know what I packed in terms of
clothing so I figured for all of you
guys that real love beauty as well I
would also go through my beauty bags in
fact I have five bags next to me here of
beauty products I have skincare and some
sort of tanning products and things from
here I've got even more skincare beauty
products in here so that's two huge bags
I then have makeup in this Chanel bag
I have brushes in this le this is
otherwise got all over it looks like
toothpaste they also have this Clinique
bag that I take everything I need for
the night time so whilst it would take
me hours to go through everything here
instead I thought what you see the
products I would take with me if I was
packing even lighter so the absolute
bare essentials when it comes to my
beauty and skincare right now let's make
a start with this bag and see what we
have in here and what I absolutely adore
I have this really dainty small version
of the eccentric molecules molecule warm
perfume sort of my absolute favorites
it's one of those kind of unisex musky
fragrances anyone can wear it smells
totally different on everyone and I
absolutely love this to the moon it back
it's so delicious another one here I've
got to mention the mister your
moisturizing body milk I always seem to
have this with me I'll be honest it's
not the most packable shape of bottle I
mean look at its kind of square and
rectangle and a bit all over the place
but I just really love the smell of this
I love how moisturize it makes me feel
like I always stop slapped with some
I'll eggs most nights yeah absolutely it
just smells so gorgeous oh my my upset
favorite on this cup looks like some
things exploded in here literally I've
just come off a plane another plane and
I thought I'll film it straight away so
I know exactly what I had here genuinely
like naturally wipe act so this is a
deal bronze for body self-tanning
natural glow cream I've used this I've
talked about so much I've used this boy
for about ten years it's incredible this
is what I use for my face because I want
to town but I want to town very
gradually I just adds a very kind of
lovely glow to you the next morning it's
gorgeous so I generally use this on
holidays most nights just kind of give
myself more glow okay next up are two
products that I am genuinely so in love
with right now from origins I have done
three long-haul flights in the past
three weeks Hong Kong Maldives and I
just got back from Dallas Texas
next I'm going to Orlando and then I'm
going to LA I think so long-haul flying
is something I'm doing a lot right now
so my skin is getting really dry at
moment it just kind of really feels like
it needs a really good detox and
hydration to the max so the last few
times I've been traveling I've taken
these with me so these from origins
origins mask you miser skin optimizing
mask primer so what you do this is after
you completely cleansed all your face
you spray this onto your face and it
just pretty much optimizes your skin and
gets it ready for the face mask it just
helps to hydrate the skin it helps to
soften the skin you just kind of make
sure that it's ready so that when you
put on the mask it's going to do the
absolute maximum performance for you
plus it's so nice when you're on holiday
and it's so warm outside you sort of
spritz it all it's just really cooling
and hydrating and and then this is a
mask up and using the origins by all
greens foaming deep cleansing mask with
green tea spirulina and spinach so this
is what I use after view some mask miser
and it is just that amazing kind of
cleansing hydrating detoxifying step it
is a clay mask but it isn't like those
wands that go really tight and really
dry and then you're kind of walking
around like unable to move your entire
face for like half an hour I thought
this is foaming and deep cleansing it's
a bit more kind of hydrating than that
it's just sort of working to unclog all
your pores detoxify the skin just give
it more life really especially after a
long haul flight this is just such a
dream but you can also use this in
replacement of your cleanser maybe two
times a week as well which is quite cool
because it just really helps to kind of
cleanse the skin unclog it detox
I personally prefer to kind of get rid
of everything first and then add this
and use it more as a mask than cleanser
it's completely do how you prefer to use
it but that's that's just the way I like
it just kind of like a one-stop shop for
the skin kind of twice a week full
cleanse and you're good to go
so match made in heaven right now really
genuinely love these the L'Oreal
professional silver gloss protect now I
have this now because I forgot to tip
this the MALDI for some reason it was to
fall at my bag or maybe I took out my
bag the night before to wash my hair or
something anyway I didn't have it with
me and a lot of you kind of noticed that
my hair went really golden blonde from
the Maldive it was so cool and what I
mean I've luckily managed to can pull it
back to a bit more silvery now and take
away that brassy tones but it went so 20
so golden in the Sun it really stripped
away the syllabus so I made sure to have
this pack now all the time it's my one
only a lot of you still ask me what I do
to get my hair so silvery and shiny gray
and it's it's all down to this the
L'Oreal professional slow shampoo as a
kind of second shampoo that you leave on
almost like a silver mask it really
really works and I love it sit for
absolute face in there let's go on to
the next skin care bag this is just a
cute little calf Kitson um wash bag of
hope for years it's seen me well it's
been on a lot of trips with this bad boy
okay oh yes something has definitely
leaked in here Oh wonderful went with
tanning there are a lot of towns I'm
really loving at the moment like cocoa
brown Beauty Liberata San Tropez this is
a vita Liberata phenomenal 2 to 3-week
tan mousse and it's always have it with
me so really easy one to top up your
tongue with in here I've also got the
Tom Ford shimmering body oil so stunning
if you're the kind of girl who loves to
go out and you love to kind of have
tanned but shiny cat like Victoria
Secret style legs this is your secret
weapon it's so wonderful it literally
spritz on your legs it has our oil
formula so it does have the shine
already but it also has the shimmer
inside it so you get this kind of
sparkles of gold hitting Ally and your
legs just go boom
I love taking this kind of add it onto
your collar bones as well and even cheek
bones if you want that really chewy look
it's gorgeous and it smells so divine is
before this is so cool I've got a few of
these actually I have a much larger
version by my bedside table I always use
every night it's the daddy oil it's a
nail treatments like a nail oil and
because I get shellac so much I really
need these sort of things so every night
before bed I've put an oil on that I'll
put hand cream on it just really helps
you get into nail bed and strengthen it
really hydrated student little split
bits all around the edge city nails
which is a tiny little version that
taken all day with me super cute but
really handy got tiny little bottle of
Loreal Elnett because you never know any
some hairspray oh my godness I have to
tell you about these the skin Iceland
hydro cool firming eye gels these are my
favorite are gels
I love the know if you saw my snapchat
when I was in Dallas I took a picture of
me with these big eye pads are they
massively helped is so wonderful if
you're really tired and you're
jet-lagged and your eyes are kind of
like so heavy it's need a bit of a
pick-me-up these are so wonderful
they're just paths just like really
hydrating so of moist pads moist and use
placing on just onto clean skin just
sort of pull your eye back making it
more taut and lay it down across and dry
and leave it there 50 minutes I went to
have a shower I got myself ready she'll
have them on took them off put on makeup
this kind of helps to write up that area
give it a bit more life give it a bit
more moisturization and it just makes
your eyes and your whole face just look
a lot more alive and these are ones that
I really really cover I love these so
much skin i someone's quick look in my
nighttime bag just see what I'm loving
yeah
always have a G with Carmack's comics I
wear every single night and I love the
mornings when you wake up and you've not
had your head pressed against the pillow
so you still got the Carmack's on your
lips and your lips just look really
plump and really like oh like Sybil I
like that and the night cream I'm loving
which I've already mentioned nothing in
my favourites but it's just the LMS
biotech skin an energizing night cream
and it's like these two different while
it's like a serum water cream and you
place them together and
I can't tell you much I love this range
seriously I'm totally in love a bit so
inside the Chanel and I had this Earl
Weaver nude spectrum palette because
these are my favorite kind of shades and
I knew I'd be sorted for different locks
with these beautifully pigmented in fact
that's what I'm wearing eyelids now just
something super simple for easy I always
have the lorac palette as you know our
massive fan of this contour palette
incredible so I use these two colors as
my setting powder this is my pretty much
my only highlight and use it most days I
use this as my bronzer and use this as
my contour so I use this entire palette
and let's just for about five minutes
doing this like powder highlight
bronzing contouring now it's just the
whole thing plus it has a huge mirror
big fan of that I've never got anywhere
without that now oh this is kind of a
new sign for me I know that amelia loves
it so much it's a lip shoot from
Charlotte Tilbury and this is in pink
Venus he's a bit sharp now I've used it
to death well this is a really great
sort of a light pink slightly nude lip
liner and it's sort of like my lips look
better and it's great for calculus I go
for foundations and I'm back on the
Armani maestro glow because it's just
incredible I've number two and a half
number four and I find having the two
with me means that when I'm super town
back in use for when I'm really not tan
I can use two when I'm in between a
cleaner but it really works into the
skin because it's more of this oily
texture but then over the day the oils
evaporate out the skin and sleeve this
beautiful pigment on the skin plus you
have SPF 30 so for me like I said I
don't really put my face in the Sun I
will usually always be in the shade so
just for those times when I'm in between
the Sun I always have the SPF 30 so
these are so great for holiday just to
have that kind of high SPF guys I found
a new favorite lipstick although it's
very very similar to my other favorite
lipstick but it's a different shade this
is the YSL rouge fill option we've come
out with a few different colors and this
is number 44 and I saw Amelia again
using this I was like what's a shade
I've never seen that for just like this
is number 44 and usually I have number
one as you might know a number one nude
kind of like magnet and this one it's
just a little bit more Brown toned I've
got an outlet this is not quite pinky
nude as the other one and the flavoring
of it that's really weird to say but the
flavoring of it isn't quite so
manufactured as the other ones the
impact this one it's almost got a bit of
passion fruit grapefruit - grapefruit
you kind of scent and it's a bit kind of
fruity which is much nicer much that
than the other formulation so number one
doesn't taste as nice as this one the
L'Oreal false lash scott mascara still
loving this so much especially when I
get the lash lips I can wear any kind of
scar it doesn't have to be waterproof
although this is a lot of staying power
and will say it's kind of one of those
mascara so it's a little bit further
towards a waterproof formulation it has
a lot of holding power but the thing I
really like about this is that the way
the nib works the idea with this is a
bit tight lines as well and whilst I'm
kind of feel like it just quite tight
line in the way you'd imagine it really
gets into the base of lashes so from
that respect it does really thicken and
plump up the lashes and just really
separates I'm wearing it right now
actually it's just gorgeous so big big
fan base like that I'll quickly mention
brushes just we've been through every
single bag and new finds for me this is
in the new Real Techniques brush step
and I mentioned the domed shadow brush
in my favourites and this is also in
that set and this has become my new
powdering brush and it's called the
multitask brush well I use it for
powdering and I use it with the lorac
Pro palette with the lighter shades as
really work it into all different areas
I need to powder and I just find that it
doesn't make my skin look cakey it just
really sweeps the product on beautifully
got my by Terry Baume De Rose lip balm
in here which is still my absolute fave
for on-the-go extreme plumps and
hydrates and it just gives the lips a
really pretty Sheen
right I'm going to leave it there guys
because that's a lot of products I've
talked about and literally losing light
as we speak all the products as always
we'll also be able to sit down below in
the description bar to hit the show more
button
show you everything that I mentioned
here but I really hope you got something
out there like these products are my
genuine favourites are the ones that I'm
literally when I go to my cabinets in
the bathroom I'm like that that that
that that that and I generally keep them
all in bags next to each other and I
keep them all ready for everything on my
trip just what I have to keep repack in
them but I'll add some things and I'll
take some bits away and these are bits
that I've been taking for especially the
last three long-haul trips
because I knew I'd need that extra off
for the skin to keep it perfect so yeah
