really really well today's video is
going to be a what's on my iPhone video
a lot of you been asking for this and I
thought it was about time I showed you
what is on my iPhone 6 so if you are
sitting comfortably let's get right into
it ok guys so this is my iPhone 6 first
of all this is a skinny-dip phone case
that's the flamingo's all over it I
thought it was super cute
yes I've not got my nails done and
that's embarrassing sorry
so anyway moving into it they for this
is a picture I took in Japan of the
cherry blossoms I thought was really
really beautiful so that is my
background okay so moving into the phone
this is how it looks on the first screen
I have all of my most used apps on the
first screen and the second screen I've
got a couple of used and a lot of things
follow it away as well this background
image you can't really see it that well
but it's an image again that I took in
Japan in this beautiful place that we
went to some hot springs it was like a
spa place it was absolutely beautiful
anyway so um first screen of course got
the usual suspects photos camera Google
Chrome I do not use Safari I cannot be
bothered with it calculator Dropbox
that's where I upload a lot of my images
say for taking image on my phone and I
need to get onto my computer I'll upload
it through Dropbox and vice versa
Spotify if you want to follow me on
Spotify by the way I am just in the thro
Spotify in the first but if I I think on
there it's all I use now Spotify really
notes I've got quite a lot of notes in
here thanks to with video ideas and
schedules and ideas what's that everyone
little whatsapp calendar settings
she sounds never know if you found a
song that you absolutely love got
Facebook I have my in the throat
Facebook of course that you can go and
follow me on if you'd like to pretty
much update that with absolutely
everything I'm doing this all my
instagrams go on there on all of my blog
posts and all of my videos youtube of
course gonna have that tumblr I'm also
on tumblr
just in the fro don't use it as much but
trying to maps uber I'm always using
uber in fact I'll leave a discount code
down below if you've never used uber to
get taxis anywhere go down below and my
code will get you a pound off so
obviously but helpful then we've got a
few of my most used photo apps which are
the most exciting really of this health
thing this one being Maldive this is
where I create pictures that might be
kind of like half and half so for
example this pitch that put my Instagram
if I wanted to have that doubled up you
can kind of like double-o-double look
like this you can you can turn it the
opposite way around so it's kind of like
a mirror effect you can make it to it
six together don't have a frame in
between it so it's like that quite cute
so that's how I create kind of double
images or four images together so that's
called multi feeling faces
the main another thing that I use in
order to edit my images is PS Express
which is Photoshop Express
it's strange how many people have not
heard of this app and yet it's like my
favorite for example I have this picture
of me and Amelia of course I'm sure you
now hear me Liliana and what I often do
is I often flip my image and then I'll
add a bit of exposure brighten it up
look at contrast in there add a bit of a
tint a bit more color bit shadows of
contrast in there soften it up a little
bit add a bit of sharpness and why not
done
and then file save to camera roll
favorite ever d pop if you'd like to
find Maddy pop again I'm just in the fro
literally if you ever wonder if I'm on
something just search her in the fro and
I'll be on it probably Instagram of
course they should play my most used app
ever I'm always using it I cannot wait
to get to 400,000 I'm super excited
so go along and follow me and make me
super happy not be amazing to have you
along there but I absolutely love my
Instagram it's an awesome platform
Wunderlist is a really cool app if you
love to make lists of things so I'm it
listen there Pinterest I am addicted
right now to Pinterest and pinning
everything I can so again I'm just in
the free on Pinterest and a have an area
that I have all of my own personal style
and wardrobe items in there I've got a
place for style inspiration if you're
looking for outfit so I would person
love to wear myself got what about shoes
what about home bathrooms kitchen things
that I make in the kitchen things I'd
like to make a lot of my beauty images
and things from the blog fit all in
there and then of course along the
bottom I've got the messages I've got my
emails phone and then Twitter and again
Twitter again is a massive platform that
I use a lot I'm always on Twitter so if
you're ever wanting to kind of speak to
me or ask me anything I'll say hello
chances are I'll be able to say hello
back or favorite at least to show you
that I love whatever you said to me
moving over here we've got the bar core
app because that's where I'm able to
book my bar call lessons which is just
my favorite thing ever right now
utilities is kind of where I keep
everything that I don't really care
about I don't really use much social
ease are just like extra social things
like Skype or vlogger or or other bits
and pieces photo and video these again
of things I don't really use much those
things like after light in there
frantastic that again you can make frame
things on I've got my GoPro app on there
I've got the Olympus app for a new thing
with my cameras but they're not too much
this is a travel area so it got story
with weather passbooks don't know why
stocks is in there but I never use it
train line citymapper if you live in
London City mapper in fact
it might be the place it's about City
mafia will change our life prob'ly vine
again I'm just in the throw in there but
I barely ever use it snap shot
I love recently I've really started
getting into it I'm not so it's not just
his day actually maybe I should snapchat
oh okay I don't know what's happening
here but I feel of quite a lot of people
on there Topshop smooth unfeeling spendy
Google studio is just something that you
she was can used to look at that videos
Snapseed is another really awesome app
if you are wanting to do some kind of
changes in terms of course this is a
picture I put on my Instagram and just
to quickly show you you can kind of
change the color of things so you can
like select an area and you guys get to
select all of it and then you can let
really change the color of that and you
know play around with the colors of it
you can desaturate things like that so
that's why I can use that for my Therese
or is like my favorite online store
that's premium fashion love that you can
only take scissors for my blog to keep
on track of that my fitness pal I tried
to use it and I kind of fell off that
that I can really really quickly
spring ninja now this is a cool game
Alex showed me the idea what this is
that you just jump over see okay I died
already you just jump from post to post
by holding down okay I'm really bad at
this anyway you get the gist fun
periscope I'm on there was in the fro
not used it yet but I will soon
and then vsco cam again I've not really
used that yet
in fact I might just put that into
Photoshop I'm so sure let's just clean
this up a bit why not and that's it and
that is everything if you'd like me to
do a full run-through of how I added to
my Instagram pictures let me know I can
show you every single app in much more
detail and how I do it exactly I mean
that's not like that process I just
showed you
for example that picture I made on that
mold Eva yeah so let me know if you'd
like to see that let me know down in the
comments but otherwise that's everything
on my phone if you know of any other
apps that you definitely think I should
need I need on my phone let me know and
I can go and get them too and that is it
a nice little peek into my iPhones
personal lights but I really hope you
enjoyed that and maybe found a new
favorite app or a new way to edit your
photos that you might really really love
really really hope so if you like this
video please do give me a like that'd be
amazing and if you're new please do
subscribe and in that case I'll see you
in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
