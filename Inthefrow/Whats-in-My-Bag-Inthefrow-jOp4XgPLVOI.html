in my bag video I'm actually never done
one of these videos I have done
something similar on my blog probably
about a year ago and today what's in my
purse blog post but I've never done
hey what's in my bag video but because I
recently got a new bag I thought I would
show you what I have put into it so
without further ado this is my new bag
how beautiful is it it's a custom
customized back from Baier bags up all
the links below for you to have a look
look buy bags you can choose all the
different types of love you want to use
different colors and they will make it
custom-made for you so this is what I
chose so I went for a black suede lid a
caramel hide body around the back and
then cobalt suede sides and then I went
for a half gold strap half leather strap
and it was so beautiful love it so much
it's just perfect it closes with a
magnetic fastening and then just opens
and side it's got cobalt and all the
lining it's also cobalt as you can see
it's absolutely full to the brim because
I have so much stuff that I put in my
bag usually I carry around the mulberry
poly push lock handbag which I've had
for about a year and a half when it came
out and I've heard that for so long and
I often keep so much stuff in it but I
got this new bag thought now it's gonna
be my new handbag for a while but I
still gotta fit in the same amount of
stuff so it's pretty packed um so I'll
show you what's inside just gonna make a
really quick note I know a few people
asked me but I recently have my hair
done same stylist they always get it
done it's not out with a bottle it's
from a hairdresser in a local village
that I go to and they've done it
completely purple with pink underneath
which camera shakes got my extensions in
which I got from chica chica hair
extensions and my hairdressers kindly
dyed my hair extensions the same color
so that they fit perfectly and it's
perfect color match I'll show you how
long they are 20 inch extensions adds a
little bit of volume and thickness and
extra length I absolutely love them
really gorgeous condition still and so I
highly recommend them and also those
t-shirts from Kinkos new collection it's
like one of their new crops if you're
interested first of all out the bag
obviously my iPhone 5 I have it with me
absolutely everywhere and usually on the
very top so I can reach it first of all
got a beautiful new phone case from
skinny-dip they always do beautiful kind
of jeweled Kasey's can buy them on their
website and also from places like
Topshop and I think Selfridges this is
one of their new ones and absolutely
love these kind of colors pink and
turquoise so that's a winner at the
moment I've got a pair of glasses I
don't wear glasses that often I should
wear them more but I don't and these are
the Emporio Armani nine six seven twos
and they look like and these kind of
feel like a bit the schoolteacher in
them but I absolutely love them
let's kick them off for a bit so those
kit in the case let's keep the same
packet of Kleenex because I have the
world's funniest eyes and nose it would
seem anytime of the year middle of
summer boiling hot and my nose will
still run and I think I almost have like
really intense hay fever I don't know
but Kleenex gonna pair them with you
it's really boring but my keys obviously
Tesco Clubcard get my points of shopping
and I've got like a little bit bash now
really cute little Canadian vamps hearts
like a wooden heart that I got in bounce
last year
I got last year and when I went
travelling and I got one for my friend
as well from Vancouver this in my one
from Banff and I've got two of these
little Edward Moncton keyrings
that have a little sort of things on
them I really love these and my mom
bought me this one the pic of happiness
may his joyful smile remind us how much
there is to be happy about pretty much
whenever I have a break up my mum will
buy me a keyring that reminds me that
life is good so then she brought me this
one the sheep of destiny
he smiles because he sees your future
and how and oh how happy shall that heat
should be so the games remind me that
I've got a future and it's gonna bright
doesn't need it I don't need a man so
absolutely love those and whenever I see
Eddie's looks and things I was I having
a read of what you saw said I don't
think it's a very wise man otherwise
just keep my notepad which is the little
mulberry notepad and I hope this still
sally's because I'm nil at the end of it
now I always just have that little notes
in it from all of my meetings at work or
meetings and the students I speak with
perfect little size carrying around I
think this is the a6 size so which fills
the bag have my diary I can't live
without a diary I know people like
having these electronic Diaries on their
phones I can't get it I can't get it I'm
gonna try to stop putting everything
into my phone I mean I do have a few
things now but I do through my work
calendar on my phone that pop up until a
minute in 15 minutes I've got a meeting
I'm already sat in the room otherwise I
just love having like a manual diary
just so you know everything else I'm so
busy all the time at the moment either
at work or blogging or events etc so I
need this and it's actually becoming a
running joke with most my friends that
they say can you book me into the diary
because
otherwise either forget or I won't be
able to see them for about eight weeks
because I've got too many things coming
up
so diary this one is from blocked which
recently opened in the and a lie not
justice I got one of those I've got my
trusty headphones iPhone headphones with
the little remote control on them which
I love have obviously for my notebooks
on my diary I have this cute little pen
from Schaefer which is little pink
frosted pen which someone bought me
recently H was very nice of them and
talked to keep up with me everywhere cuz
it's super handy it's really cute to
write where they have my purse which is
the mulberry poly posh polit poly push
lock purse which matches my poly push
lock back but obviously I've change bags
I still keeping the same purse because I
just love it and opens a little push
lock on the front inside it's got a
zipped compartment
oh my cards cards cards no cash though
no cash probably a couple of pennies and
it's about a pounds worth of pennies and
um but it just keeps hurting in there
and really stay secure so still adore
this one of my ex-boyfriends Bob eNOS a
couple years ago which I still adore him
for forget to the makeup and my Shu
Uemura eyelash care this much I
generally get out my bag kill my lashes
do mouth she's in the morning put it
back in my bag go to work so they're
always with me anyway I have this little
purse which is caskets in it's a little
bit kind of just colored now probably
cuz I've had it for about a year and a
half and I think I also took it to
America so no doubt it's just full of
the mod um but it just keeps on my
makeup together let's see what we have
first of all treble extra strong mints
almost finished I always have a pack of
triple strong mint I don't like chewing
gums they take too long do they make you
jorik or as minutes he can eat quickly
nice fresh breath straight away and
everyone knows now that I have mints or
whenever there need one is always the
key thing element
it's like right okay so mints um I'm a
little mirror this one's just from
Birchbox that kind of bitch box but you
guys gotta have a mirror and I've got my
trusty Aiko liquid metal eyeliner stylus
and I usually use which should be in
here as well thing is it yes it is I
usually use Aiko liquid eyeliner um I
found these we're kind of drying up a
little bit too much much faster than I
wanted them to although they are
absolutely brilliant I've shown this off
before super amazing nib and super black
and then I also got the liquid metal one
and it's kind of like a pump up action
you twist this pumps the gel up and you
can put it on again so it's super
intense and super black so Ben love this
as well but I've got both just in case
the Illamasqua I'm skin base lift
brightening concealer in light one cute
little concealer little mirror cuz you
never know if you need to touch up
anything forgotten I've also got this
little the body sharp and top sticky
about this little top down again hills
and they put little samples in them so I
had loads of these and what I did was
put some of a foundation in there it's
what was it I think it was kind of one
of those and new things I think it might
been made lean but it's one of those
kind of new skin little parts like it
like a mousse foundation you put on
anyway I hate it up my face but when I
wear nude lip I like to nude at my lips
I didn't dip my finger in this nude at
my lips and then I can add a nude lip of
the top but it looks perfect
so I always have a little one of those
and the friendly touch-ups again on my
face super handy and say is he carrying
around a huge foundation with you so
then I also have well bubbles bubbles
don't my go to brow and I got around
here at so you don't even have blonde
hair but still bubbles
and I wear lip balms I have a Carmex
ever comments by my bed and I'm a comics
in my bathroom because you can't ever go
without comics so Carmex before and
after any lipstick application and
during the day also have a little
chapstick in strawberry that I picked up
in America on my troubles last year and
it just smells really really yummy and
it's really good um in terms of lipstick
so I've gotten here yeah I've got the
Julie Hewitt
edie lipstick which is a really pretty
very light pink more of a nude shade pie
it's really beautifully and I've done a
blog post on this if you want to have a
look at that in more detail but got
other nude and I've got the illamasqua
Fable lipstick which is my current
absolute favorite and I finished it in
my last video my lipsticks video really
beautiful peachy light pink nude much
more of a chalky matte texture as with
all Illamasqua lipsticks but I always
have that on me now and finally might
one of my absolute favorite lipsticks is
cream cup by Mac I don't know why I have
three nudes in here but I do so I mean
when I wear a dark lip or a red lip or a
purple lip like today whatever I've put
on in the morning I'll then take with
MAPE and I'll put it back out again
because I don't wear it everyday where
else
cream cup and the nude pink lips I will
wear daily generally for work because I
know that it's topping I love my teeth
I'm not in the middle of a lecture
talking to people with red teeth so
cream core for a little extra glass and
I've got the Clarins instant light
Perfector in here this one is in shade
for Holly just a rose one but it's just
so beautiful to put on it really does
perfet your lips beautiful shade we also
got the Lord and berry lip liner in
romantica really nice light pink goes
perfectly with fable and those kind of
sticks add a bit of a line of color I
found that's probably one the best I
found actually if it kind of a nude like
pink lip I also have a little Clinique
Testim scar in here because if it comes
off my bottom lashes during the day and
going out after work I always like to
kind of had a look at my scar and make
sure my eyes pop again that's really
helpful and finally I've got this a
glass from mavala and in shade bubblegum
and I absolutely adore these lip glosses
I've got another one as well it's
slightly different color but they're
just the apply so beautifully they're
not sticky and the color is just so
bright and poppin so I kind of have that
to go over the top of maybe Fable if I
want to sort of brighten mop again if
I'm going out after work is everything
in my bag nice empty bag again and so
highly recommend buyer if you're after a
new bag especially if you want to
customize it this is 120 pounds and like
I said you can customize every single
detail on it so you can make it your own
and it's beautiful leather and it means
it got a completely unique back for you
so I think the price is totally well
worth it as always you can follow me on
instagram and twitter at in the fro you

fashion and outfit posts and everything
