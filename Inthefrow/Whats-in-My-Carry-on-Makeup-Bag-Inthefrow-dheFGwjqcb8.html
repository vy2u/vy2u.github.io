really really well this video is going
to be my travel on makeup Beauty kit
I don't think I've done this before I'm
seeing as I'm a traveling tomorrow to
New York for a few days and then after
that I'm also going to the Maldives
but because I'm going there tomorrow I
am packing now packing all of my bags up
my suitcases and my travel bags and I
thought I'd show you exactly I was
lacking this is my cubby case it's a
cute little Ted Baker travel case it is
cabin size so you're like to take it on
to any flight and you can put in the
overhead storage compartments it fits
those perfectly I've taken this now on
Ryanair easyJet every single type of
airline and it's all good it's all good
thing I love the most about these cases
you may have seen that I can use these
before but this is the brand-new version
of the cases and they're in a pink with
rose gold and it has this rose gold
hardware on it with almost like a white
loader so that comes out it's all rose
gold with white rose gold and white
handles as well
it's super cute and if I can show you
inside this is so hard to my hand up
inside it's got this like birds of prey
print hey love it so I have that is my
carry-on and they also have the matching
large suitcase as well without we go
inside the plane of course with most of
these things I've got my passport and
I've got this little Jimmy Choo little
gold coin wallet and I always take this
away from my little holidays as it keeps
my cars in there and a little bit of
currency so those rough see in there and
they also have my camera for the trip
which is my vlogging and also my
photography camera and that is the
olympus pen ep-1 and i have in the white
i also taking with me this is a
seventeen millons i use this if i'm
doing food shots or some product shots
or selfie shots in the mirror for my
instagram I also have a 45 mil lens and
also 75 mil lens those lenses a person
for anyone who likes doing fashion
photography and lots Taggarts incredible
at depth of field where you get the
blurry background
like what I've got going on right now
yes I'll be taking that with me so let's
get into the good stuff now everything
in this little Burberry case that I keep
this is what I keep in my handbag
usually at all times I'm yet to do and
new what's in my handbag video very very
soon I'll be doing that soon so this
will appear and that I've got everything
in this for now okay now it depends as
it's quite an early flight tomorrow I
haven't decided yet if I'm gonna have a
little bit of make a part of it like
what I've got today or if I'm just gonna
go completely barefaced chances are I'll
just go bare face get onto the plane and
just go with my cream cream routine if
not then I also have these with me the
cutest little Lancome miniatures so this
is the non oily sensitive eyes instant
cleanser which is fantastic I makeup
remover so I'll definitely taking that
if I have any mascara on so wipe it away
really quickly and I also have a
comforting cleansing milk for dry skin
so again I'll be using that to take off
any kind of residue on my face or any
makeup because with a long haul flight I
prefer not to have any makeup on because
I have very sensitive eyes and I'm
always rubbing my eyes and I'm always
touching my face and I can't be bothered
having loads of makeup on my face if I
just wanna kind of chill out then after
everything's removed I have two little
tiny creams with me which are perfect
for traveling so this is the hydro-zone
from Lancome a soothing anti stress
moisturizing cream so I'll be dousing my
skin in this whilst on the plane and I
also have a little miniature of the
hydrogen I contour gel so I've put in
the on with the cream and this should be
wonderful and hydrating for on the
flight and I've just got them inside my
little Clarisonic Heath Herring caring
cosmetic bag as they are collaborating
at the moment which is all the reasons
why I went to New York so I've got them
in there for further moisture and they
were just like perk up my skin when we
finish the flight I'm also gonna be
taking the chordally great water this is
just so lovely this is like a little
refresher right
I've also been wanting to try out these
products for ages so I think want to
take these with me for me an M to play
around with M is a good friend she's a
blogger friend and she's coming with me
to New York so on the play mean here can
move play around with these these the
skin Iceland
they're like gels for the face so this
one is for smile lines this one's for
eyes and this one's for the forehead and
it's not jilsuk stick on they're really
hydrating and brightening and all that
good stuff so might play around with
some of these as well I'm gonna have my
tangle teezer with me as I always always
have just my favorite type of brusha you
know and then we've got everything
that's inside let's go back so what do
we have the LMS mirror this is the
25-year mirror it's a huge mirror and I
just love that it just comes in a lot of
pouch that's super easy I've got my
motion sickness tablets here with me the
cinema theme just butoh but I get
sociable sick on every mode of transport
especially boats Karl's are pretty bad
as well and whites so I've got those
with me I've got some hand sanitizer as
I don't generally go anywhere without
hand sanitizer now especially in London
and I'm touching the tubes and I'm
touching railings and escalators and all
that I just really like to keep my hands
clean and I always really trust Care
Act's as a brand I think it's a
surrounding - my mom always used at home
and all that so yeah I trust carrots a
lot and this is a strawberry laces
flavour so it smells although much more
alcoholic than the usual sort of hand
sanitizers you get at home bosses is a
much more concentrated style a little
pen in here I always have a pen in my
makeup bag just in case this is one bye
so I asked you which is really cute it
was a black section and also glittery so
the vittles
I'm gonna take a foundation with me and
the one that I know I can trust straight
away to be generally my skintone and do
exactly what I wanted to do it's an
Asscher glow so I have a sinned oval as
always so I'll be taking that with me to
go with it I'll be taking the beauty
blunder but I generally can't do my
concealer or foundation well concealer
especially without this but when I'm on
the go I can't take in a brush I just
take this and do everything in one and
I've also got two concealers so this
will probably be when we get to New York
just before we get there I'll probably
put on a little bit of makeup so part of
an hour glow I'll put on these I'm just
you know spruce up my face a little bit
the Clarins instant concealer I have
gotten number one and also Bobby Brown's
corrector in light peach as I know that
this straight away I could spruce up my
under eyes amazingly put a bit of this
on it will just brighten everything up
and again I've got my Beauty Blender and
I can just wipe it all in and dab it in
it a look from plastic it'll just make
me look a little bit more awake I've got
a bubble in there cuz you always need a
bubble for something and then I've got
some lip products and usually I have a
lot more lip products in my makeup bag
than this but I've downsized being for
the plane so the main things I have as
always my by Terry Baume De Rose lip
balm which I'm use for everything every
single day it's my favorite and this
alone / nude lip just looks so pretty so
it always got saw or whirl with me as
they're just kind of my go-to shades so
Mac saw need to give that a bit of a
sharpen to go with that I have the YSL
rouge pur Couture in number 10 and I
adore this shade it's so gorgeous it's
like a nude with a lilac undertone to it
so it's a little bit I mean oh yeah it's
so lovely it's just really kind of
natural new deep pink with a little
lilac undertone and then last thing in
here is just a lip gloss just in case I
like a spruce up a bit and I'm obsessed
with this one moment this is from
Burberry
this is number 17 nude beige by Burberry
but I found that these few products
together and is kind of my go-to
they just are the off suit each other
I'm just in her
smell it that's everything I'm taking in
my carry-on makeup bag with skincare
mean the main things for me is that I
can straightaway take off my makeup I
know people really love to take face
wipes but no one I don't really like
face wipes and number two I think that's
too concentrated for my skin whenever I
use a face wipe down my skin just feels
like it's on fire I almost feel like
there's too much alcohol in face wipes
and it really soft burns my skin I don't
know so I just I don't touch them so
that's why getting little miniatures
like this that I'll be able to take and
I'll be taking and use my favorite type
of face wipes these are the bait beats
baby face wipes which are extra large I
just love that with the ease it can take
off your entire face with just one pass
so I'll be taking threw those away as
well probably just like that when I woke
up ready pass them on to hear why fall
of my face it's clean before putting on
everything else that's everything I hope
that was a nice little insight really
hope you enjoy that let me know down
below and leave me some comments let me
know what you take in your carry-on
luggage maybe it's similar to mine or
maybe you got some other kind of routine
that you love doing every time you go on
long flights you liked it then please
