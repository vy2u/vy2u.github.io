overdue video I've been the nymph
illness for so so long today I'm going
to show you my brand new bag
and I'm going to show you what is inside
it this might be a little bit of a mess
because I haven't actually looked at
this beforehand I didn't want to have to
go to it and be like pulling out
everything because then it's just not
authentic it's not real and I want to
sort of show you just how messy this
might actually be so this is my new bag
I got this I think I got this the first
week of December in the November Black
Friday sales so I got this from
Selfridges well this is the Yvonne she
Antigona in the deep blue shade which is
a few different websites is referred to
as the navy this is the small size so
they also do a medium size which is
quite a bit bigger really and they also
do a mini size which is super cute and a
little tiny version of this sort of
thing you could throw over your shoulder
as a little almost clutch mini bag and
if any of you guys are readers of my
blog and have been for quite a while or
if you have watched this channel for
quite a while you will know that I
bought Oh Siobhan she had to go and brag
about a year and a half maybe two years
ago now I bought the baby pink colour so
just like this but bigger medium and the
baby pink color and I totally love that
bag I was so smitten with it and you may
remember that I had a bit of drama with
it and that when the raindrops hit it
when I went outside with it the rain
turned the pink blue so everywhere where
the rain would hit the bag it would
splatter blue
I mean Brett talked about to Selfridges
and was like my bag is turned blue what
on earth is going on and they were just
so perplexed and like and we don't get
it I would understand maybe it is a blue
there's something blue behind the pink
leather that's that well why would there
be this doesn't seem right so they were
confused I was confused
luckily they let me refund that bag so
since then I've also took the bags
remember just how much I loved it but I
didn't go back to it however when I saw
that it came in the blue I was totally
smitten completely fell in love with it
I don't have a blue bag and therefore
and needed a brand new robust everyday
handbag so just a little bit more info
on the back in case you like it comes
with a large shoulder strap which is all
my favorite things about this bag
actually and it's a really robust strap
you know I've got something really
digging into your shoulder at all times
most of time I will carry the bag like
this with my shoulder and all the times
I'll carry it in the crook of my arm
like this it just keeps it close to me
and especially it's not too heavy this
is fine like this one of the main things
that people usually love about this bag
as well if it has a really robust zip so
the zip is really thick really strong so
that's one thing I really love about it
it is really robust else is everything
else on this wall the metalwork all the
features are all very strong very very
structured it holds its structure so
well as well the small one holds its
structure much better than immediate my
phone as well let's get into what's
inside it so inside as well it's sort of
like a baiji cotton learning just super
easy and it has one large sit pocket and
it's got a mobile phone holder it's also
got one smaller pocket as well okay what
we're going here
first thing is just a super boring easy
umbrella that I picked up one day when I
was caught in the rain thing this was
just a super easy one from Debenhams
often here I have the umbrella top okay
my trusty Apple earphones I love these
I've used quite a few other types of
earbuds and none are ever quite the
quality of the sound quality and comfort
of these so I'm more than happy to have
a pair of those at all times with me
tangle teezer this is lilac and pink one
you may know I've got quite a few of
those different colors and I happened to
burst everywhere when I need them this
is my handbag one keeps my hair really
nice and quite volumize dand it's very
good at aiming that's for sure so I have
one of those with me gosh it is quite an
S actually
I've got some train tickets from London
to Wigan that were for Christmas Eve
when I went home this I've got a receipt
for co-op for lots and lots of really
healthy foods actually good okay
then we've got my mobile phone at the
moment I've got this riddle of a case on
which is a quite a cool geometric
pattern in lilac mint green corals and
Pink's so it's very pasteurized case
this is by an independent designer a
Niki strange I think Nicky strange
I'll live link down below to this phone
case this is the iPhone 6 trial of it's
my favorite phone so far what else been
on here I've got a Selfridges voucher
that my brother gave me I threw in here
the day cuz I mean we're going shopping
just make sure I had it with me so thank
you to my brother I've got an in viscid
bubble it's always good to have
something to tell your hair up with and
I will just Chuck that in one day here
I've got a little mini bottle perfume
this one is the molecule one and this is
a cutest tiny little bottle so it's
perfect to carry around I say blow for
the past ten years I've adored this
scent it's a unisex fragrance has notes
to it that anyone could wear but it's so
beautiful and you can try this
I think this selling Harvey Nicks will
sell it for a blade liberty and I sell
it then we have my makeup bag that I
keep inside it this is a Burberry case
just a nice red Burberry case and I'm
here I keep all my cosmetics for the day
let's have a peek inside here first up
is this LMS mirror
I've had this now for quite a while and
the thing I love about it is it it's
absolutely massive this is the 25 years
anniversary edition that LMS brought out
I like to keep it as pouch just so it's
kept safe and don't get eyeliner drawn
all over inside this maple back ok I've
got some quills in here which are
actually finished and I've got one left
because I suffer from really bad travel
sickness so they're always good to have
on me much got a traveller in here and
inside of here I've got the Kenzo
fragrance so recently I'd accounted a
bit of that into the traveller so if you
never seen these before
it's just like a little perfume tan
little parfum spray that's empty over 70
buy it and then you take off the top of
your perfume bottle put this onto it
stop push it down and it'll start to the
perfume will spray into this it's almost
like you can create a little tiny vial
of perfume to take around with you Pandy
okay makeup right what forgotten here
I've got a couple more in busy bubbles
cuz that's all I ever use I've got I
have my Olympus 75 mil lens cap that's
not good at all why is that not on the
camera I've got a Boop's empty blister
stick these are actually so good if you
wear heels a lot a few we're like
ballerina shoes flat shoes and you find
there would be quite often this is
really really helped me but it's just
like a waxy finish and all I do is just
rub it along the back of your ankles
frypot on the shoes and it just creates
more of a barrier on the skin so that
you don't get as much friction and
therefore you don't start cutting and
blistering so it's actually really
really good I highly recommend it this
is a boots well I've also got the Bobbi
Brown corrector and light peach in here
so there's last-minute concealer
touch-ups and that's one the best for
touch-ups I found it super easy just to
remove any dark patches on your face
during the day in case that was enough I
also have the mac studio finish
concealer in nw20 which is very very
similar in it to the Bobbi Brown this is
a little bit more beachy toned which
like the Bobbi Brown
but just as good really don't know why
I've got both in there I've got the Tom
Ford eyeliner because it's my go to my
absolute favorite and it's best to have
it with you during the day
I've got Mac soft lip liner
I've got Mac cherry so I go for red I've
also got Mac well so got two nudes and
cherry I've also got Burberry rosewood
just burn another pinky nude I've got
the mirror Ness liner that I really love
that I show you every time so it is
double sided
I've got that with me too that's just
another favorite anymore lip liners in
here nope okay that's it for the
climbers I've also got the ICO black
magic eyeliner which is awesome actually
and I've also got the gallon car key
driver eye pencil I think that means
I've got this is because a few weeks ago
I was wearing on my eyes and I took this
out with me just fair little touch-ups
and this is cool slog they've got a
smudger on either end so that's nice
that shouldn't really be in there though
book so not there not much of this
should be in here so heavy and now I
know why and then we've got some
lipsticks which also going in my
favorites cuz I keep them with me so
this is the Clinique beige pop nice easy
easy nude very nice one this is max knob
which is a great pink very similar to
the map Lady Gaga Glam lipstick that
used to love to bits
then there's my ever so favorite YSL
nude number one roof or looked she's got
it with my favorite amazing amazing
lipstick and then this is the Tom Ford
nude for Neil which again is another
favorite nude so here I have three nudes
nudes vanilla is by far the most nudie
beige this has a little bit more pink
tone in it and this also this beautiful
glass which I did mention in my December
favorites video this is wiggle on glass
in 472 which i think is called candy hop
candy hop is the actual name of it if
you need to found that well this is an
absolutely beautiful lip gloss it is
almost a little bit barmy as well but
the packaging is divine
I love that and that is it for the
Berber makeup bag okay what else do we
have in here got my keys which I don't
think I've changed much since last time
that I did it what's in my bag and I've
got two of the Edward Moulton keyrings
that I've got the lovely kind of
motivational messages on them this one
says the pig of happiness may his joyful
smile remind us how much there is to be
happy about and this one is a sheep of
Destiny
he smells because he sees your future
and oh how happy shiny off you to be my
mum bought me nice just as light nice
little life quotes
of those and I think the newest thing
spray on here is this little charm which
I got from Japan in fact I've got all of
my family one and I got my friends one
and they're just nice of keyrings and
I'm pretty sure this one means good luck
not too sure I think it means good luck
I have two more lip balms in here which
must have fallen out of like the other
case what they'll just about anyone's I
don't know why this both in here but
I've got the original lip balm and I've
also got the pink one which is so near
to the end at one of the binding one
because it's so good so key lip balms
they need to go inside the bear boob
back oh then I've got some competes this
thing since sliced bread I've got quite
a few different types of confit in there
just in case I get any blisters the best
list of processes ever if you never
heard of comp you need to get yourself a
pack if you suffer with blisters on the
back your feet like I was saying like I
was talking about with the little
blister thing before these are so good
and the very last thing in here is my
Dior purse which you're seen if you
watched my what I got for Christmas
video so if you watch that you'll know
Alex got me this for Christmas it's
beautiful do your envelope wallet which
i think is part of the DRS emo
collection because there is a bag that
matches this purse it's got a love
little silver charms on the end opens up
like this and it says Christian Dior
Paris on here and it's this beautiful
bright pink and so I can quickly knit
