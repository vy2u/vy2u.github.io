our haul I don't think I have ever done
azar a haul on my channel and if I have
it was most definitely three or four
years ago four maybe five years ago I
don't even know in Astley I don't shop
in sorrow that often I always loved
everything that everyone else wears from
Zara for some reason I just barely ever
go in that shop I don't know why however
I haven't seen people wearing some
amazing amazing things recently from
Zara and I got a little bit jealous a
little bit FOMO and I was like I'm gonna
place an order online I was also told by
a friend but they're ordering online
services the delivery services were so
much better now than they used to be I
remember these to take like two weeks so
I thought I kind of want to test out the
delivery process see how it all was and
try out some new things with Zara so
let's try on together okay let's get
right into this parcel this parcel has
now been sat in my office for over five
days and I'm dying to see what's inside
it I haven't even opened this box yet
first thing is first this little blue
player jacket I thought was something
between a Chanel and a Gucci and in fact
the material feels really quite good I
really nice actually it's got a nice
little creamy lining it fits quite nice
I think I got extra small yeah this
dress - I had my hair done today so when
you have your hair done it feels a bit
flat I'm having one of those days I'm
sorry oh don't keep I don't wanna keep
playing my hair yeah this is actually
quite cute feels a really great quality
like this rope ping around the coughs ah
no it makes it look super expensive it's
really nicely made I really like this
okay I changed into a white teks it was
annoying me that dress I wasn't sure in
it with that so I went to see it with a
white tee
I just feel like it looks really quite
expensive it looks quite Chanel like I
mean it's got some really lovely
features that make it look really quite
expensive so that is quite a find
I'm happy with
this okay right so this is like Ella for
tweed dress on the website the model was
wearing it over a little white t-shirt
that's actually really quite sweet I
really like that it doesn't feel too
sure either well it's really cute it's
like Tweedy fabric it's like pinafore
style the issue with not wearing a
t-shirt is that you'll get this well you
could easily just wear a bandeau bra I
could maybe wear this with my do your
breath it's more bun down underneath let
me let me back you on okay we've had a
full shift around in the room I was like
I need you to be able to see exactly
what I'm showing you so this is a little
bit more dress it's absolutely adorable
I love these little bits of fringing on
it I'm cringing around the pockets he's
keeping buttons
I feel like Zara has always been a bit
of a Chanel dupes place to go with the
tweeds and the boot play style fits feel
like this is kind of part of that kind
of thing just just throw this on over
any white t-shirt I'll wear over a
bundle with some cute little heels it's
gonna look really gorgeous off laughs of
course but you know me
but I actually really like this I think
this is a label it was like 29 pounds
okay next one let's dip into the bag
what we have here
oh it's jumpsuit and it's really really
nice bun down blue white stripes right
wide qalaat legs
this is really really gorgeous I like
the fact it's got like plastic strips
here that like hold this like it grips
to you oh there's no pockets there's no
pockets all right where are the pockets
cute little cutout all right it's almost
like wrapping around the boss that's
really pretty
oh it's really actually nice can you
guys see where this goes down to like
grazing just above my uncle I'm five
seven by the way but you know I realize
this is 50 pounds I really like it I
wish our pockets I know it's only
something small but really just like to
have pockets just to walk around without
a stick no it kind of adds to a jumpsuit
for me pocket
but at the same time like the fit is
quite nice it's quite sweet I like the
shape fabric feels really nice fits well
some nice details what'd you guys think
what'd you guys think I'm still gonna
have all of the clothes by the time you
guys see this so let me know your
thoughts up on what you think I should
keep yeah this is how long we're talking
want to think about is jumpsuit when I
think about it okay
next item this little sundress again I
got the next smallest of 30 pounds Oh or
realized I hope if this this is really
pretty
button detailing down the side different
stripes to mix up a little bit it's a
long MIDI link okay this is absolutely
beautiful
now this is extra small though do you
wish it's a little more fitted although
maybe I'm being fussy here cuz it does
actually look at it it does fit me
really nicely without being too tight
maybe I'm just used to things being too
tight and I just got used to it
I really really like this a lot I think
everyday with some little flats on or my
mules could look great with this
gorgeous and I like the fact that I can
wear this it's thinking off material
that I could wear this without bra I'm
not feel worried that my nipples are
showing on I think this is beautiful how
much did this say it was I think it's
about 50 pounds but material feels
lovely it's a gorgeous shape it's a
little bit sexy and pretty without being
like too over-the-top
oh okay okay winner I love this a lot
I'm not sure you guys so you get little
idea of the length at the bottom I
really love this I like this I loved a
lot left now then this is one of the
things I really really wanted to order
and it's a mustard suit I usually take
away like quite clear from mustard I'll
be honest because with my hair color I'm
never too sure but I saw that this came
with matching trousers that wide leg of
like I need to try it so let's try it on
okay so I'm just trying it first of all
with a white tee on with the trousers
now the trouser
a little bit lightweight I mean they
need the new denying big time but I
don't know that they feel a little bit
lightweight and there's a sheen on them
and look at them as a sheen on them that
makes them look a little bit cheaper you
know I mean something that the fabric
doesn't look overly expensive and the
way it's draping isn't overly flattering
nothing got some heels on to kind of
elevate me bit it's not looking like
extremely flattering here this blazer
mm-hmm I want to buy Blazers that do
often like to buy the matching suit
pants like just in case I don't know how
I feel about these suit pants I feel
like they're almost a bit too wide look
at them they look a little bit like
clown pants a little bit what the blazer
like over the white tee looks kind of
nice I'm thinking if I wore this with
maybe with jeans even like gray jeans
could look cool I don't know I just
thought this would make a really nice
evening suit with the wider legs and
cute little heels but I'm not sure how I
feel let me get the chair it's got the
chair out so you can see so this is what
I mean
their land loan bloom leg I think a bit
too long but then I'd really like this
blazer and don't have a blaze of this
color so I'm thinking maybe like get the
Blazer send back the suit pants let me
know let me know guys were you saying
let me know oh I forgot that I've seen
these and pick these up these are the
Zara cat eye glasses and I absolutely
love them fantastic pretty sure these
were lightweight so say 15 oh yeah
yes I believe or not I don't even own
these yeah I know the specs do some of
the best ones and everybody's been
wearing them and I just haven't managed
to pick them up and I really like those
I think they look really easy breezy and
16-pound you can't really complain like
we also do them in white and they'll see
them in tortoiseshell but I couldn't
find the tortoise shot and they'd all
run out these are the medium I think the
Orcas could imagine a standard but grey
love them we've also got another suit
this is one of the things that drew me
wow that's pink that's very it's almost
like neon pastel this is some of the
things that drew me to go to Zara I
don't know if it was but someone was
wearing a pink suit it might even have
been on Instagram and I was like I
bought pink suit from reserves recently
and it just wasn't correct do you mind
yeah I bought a pink suit recently from
reserved and I wasn't quite sure on the
color of it so I'm back into store and
refunded it but try this and see if I
like it more or I really love this top
though I love the blazer currently
trying the trousers they're very fitted
they're very fitted and true to form
okay I'm not sure I'm already not sure I
didn't really want something so fitted
there so fitted that can you see can you
see this
it's like formed remain calm and it's
also it's like a dropped hem line on the
trouser so the back goes down longer now
pink blazer though is really cute I like
these white buttons this nice it's
really nice I don't like white lining
showing when I'm talking to my blazer
sleeves though cuz I often took my
blazer sleeves just a little bit more
yeah I mean the Blazers lovely actually
how much is this this is 70 pounds it's
not super super affordable price but at
the same time it's actually really
really quite nice the trousers now where
the trousers fall kind of in-between the
ankle and Nate it's not flattering on me
it's making my legs look larger than
they are
it doesn't look slimming at all Oh what
shanks actually like this blazer what I
might do is I might go into a Zara as
soon as I can and see if there's
anything that will match this blazer in
terms of trousers are different because
they had a few different types of
rousers that went with different lasers
you have like three different flavors
this one's the one I like the most
these trousers not doing it for me okay
guys so that was my little flower haul
there were nine what nine pieces here
did you feel like I ordered more but
love the glasses absolutely adore that
dress love it the jumpsuit I love the
blazer and a blue clear blazer as well
so I do you think I did pretty well here
with its fall but she's my first
bakit sorry but these glasses are a hit
though love these so that's it guys what
