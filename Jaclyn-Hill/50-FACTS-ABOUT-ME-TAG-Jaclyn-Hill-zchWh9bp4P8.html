then you know that I have a scratched
cornea right now I actually have three
scratches on my left eye in a triangle
right here and the doctor told me that I
can't wear makeup for seven days and
it's only been four and I prom night up
today to kind of test it out because I'm
so eager to wear makeup and get back to
filming and my eye is not irritated yet
by it so I figured since I have makeup
on I should just film a video really
quick before I wash my face anyways I
have been requested to do the 50 to 50
facts about me 50 yeah 50 facts about me
tag right yes 50 facts about me tag I
have seen quite a few of you asking me
to do this just because you want to know
a little bit more about my life I did do
a question and answer video I don't know
when that was but I figured why not I
have on makeup so let's do it I'm a
self-taught makeup artist I did not go
to school for it
I take brushing my teeth very seriously
I scrubbed my teeth I scrubbed my tongue
i scrub the two roof of my mouth I just
cut my cheeks at least twice a day it is
very important to have good oral hygiene
and your tongue is not supposed to be
white it's supposed to be pink
just ask Miley she knows about that life
I am very messy I am clean but I am very
messy there is a difference there I am a
night owl if I am in bed with my head on
the pillow by midnight that is an early
night for me I was born and raised on a
pig farm in Illinois my entire family is
as goofy as me we all cross our eyes we
all make weird noises we all tell jokes
we all have a morbid twisted sense of
humor when I was younger we used to have
face offs we used to take pictures of
each other making like the ugliest
craziest faces that we could and then
just sit around and look at them and
just laugh and come up with commentaries
for it so it is not just me it runs in
my blood just to be really really silly
my mom is one of my best friends if not
my number one best friend in the entire
world I do not cook at all I literally
can't stand being around negative people
it's one thing if you want to joke
around and be negative like oh my life
sucks uh-huh but at the end of the day
just like someone who is truly always
negative I cannot deal with it growing
up I was a cheerleader and then when I
was 13 I became a cheer coach for the
Wildcats and seriously is every single
cheer squad named the Wildcats and I did
win an award for most motive
cheer coach I think it's the only
awarded everyone go Jacqueline I am
completely against drugs I have never
been a party girl I do not want kids
right now I personally love kids I love
their spirit and their excitement for
life but in my near future I just don't
see kids I've only broken one bone in my
life and it was in my hand and it was
just a couple of months ago my happiness
comes from my family I love my family
so much through good or bad fights tears
whatever it may be I just I love my
family so much that's where I'd go to
recharge my battery I have braces for 11
months when I was how old was I 30 12
years old 13 12 13 I was 13 I used to
dance in front of my mirror for hours
like Britney Spears blink 182 I would
come out of my bedroom huffing and
puffing so hard like getting a glass of
water from the refrigerator and my mom
would be like you okay and I'm big I
would seriously make up so many dance
routines oh it was the best days in my
life dancing in front of my mirror home
was school problems I got married when I
was 19 years old I do not read books
that's not something I'm proud of I just
I just don't read them I one brother and
one sister my brother is almost 11 years
older than me and my sister is seven and
I am very close to both of them
I am very strong-willed there's a lot of
it because it's like duh and in my mind
if I want to do something and then the
word no is not an option my dad was in a
horrible car accident when I was seven
years old it was devastating and that is
why we moved across the country and left
all of our aunts and uncles and
grandparents in Illinois cats hate me so
I prefer dogs growing up I always wanted
a different name my top three picks were
Zoey Riley and Roxy I think I have a
shopping problem
I am very independent I do not have a
diet and I have not worked out and over
a year oh my god I cannot believe I just
said that do not try to eat healthy
which is horrible of me I love watching
movies I am very very forgiving I am
really good about not judging people I
know that sounds kind of
but I am I try really really hard not to
judge people since I've been judged so
much I feel like I'm pretty good and not
judging people my first job was at a
fast food restaurant working the
drive-through it was oh I do not get sad
I get angry I rarely cry if I am crying
it means that it is really a big deal
it's something that I truly am holding
in for a long time I don't cry for no
reason I don't tear up over a little sad
puppy commercials it takes a lot to make
me cry and I typically get angry before
I cry because I just I hate the motion
of crying I have to touch John who is my
husband when I sleep every single night
even if it's just like the back of my
hand like on his arm I have to touch him
when I sleep if like I turn over in the
middle of the night and I kind of wake
up I'll like move my arm over just like
make sure like my elbow is touching him
or something I just I constantly have to
have contact on him knowing that like
he's next to me I don't know why it's
just like it's been that way ever since
we first got married I do not drink
caffeine literally no caffeine I used to
be like addicted to caffeine I had to
have coffee every single morning but now
I haven't even so much as had an Advil
that has caffeine in it and over a year
I pretty much only drink water I was
taught to drive in an SUV and I'm pretty
sure I will drive an SUV into the day I
die I focus on my makeup and neglect my
hair pretty much every day I struggle
with severe anxiety and panic attacks
but I'm really good at keeping it hidden
for the most part and living a balanced
life I'm a CD not in a like clean freak
messy way but in like having to like
touch things a certain amount of times
away I'm such a freak sometimes like at
night when I like lock my door I have to
check at least twice so like my front
door is locked I can't just like look at
it and bake oh yeah it's locked I'm good
to go can I like I have to go up to it
and like wiggle it like twice to make
sure that it's locked
