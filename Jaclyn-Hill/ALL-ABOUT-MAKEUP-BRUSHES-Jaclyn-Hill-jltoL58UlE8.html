video for me because not only am i doing
my most requested video of all time but
I'm also filming with a brand new camera
so I am an HD with a Here I am you can
see only imperfection it's ready there I
am for real we'll see what happens
alright so my most asked questions on
this channel is about brushes what
brushes I think are the best what
brushes are absolutely necessary to have
what I think the brushes you should own
if you're starting professional makeup
kit so on and so forth how to clean your
brushes all these different things so
basically today it's going to be brush
101 I'm going to tell you my personal
opinions of what I think are the best
brushes what you should spend money on
and what's not necessarily you know
needed to spend money on and what you
can get for a cheaper price I do have my
iPad right here with me so that I can
look up some of the things online like
prices and stuff and help you guys out a
little bit so I'm sorry if I'm like
looking down all the time and know I'm
not one of those people who carries my
iPad around with me everywhere thinking
I'm like so fabulous this was a
Christmas present from my husband and I
thank him for every day because I'm
extremely happy to have this so I'm not
like me and my iPad Starbucks like oh my
god no please let's get real so let's
just start right off the bat first of
all the way I store my brushes as I keep
them in a little container like this I
got this at the Container Store and they
were three dollars I believe I think
they were $2.99 apiece and they were
like this beige-ish color that wasn't
like that cute and so I just spray
painted it silver I just sat them down
on newspaper and just spray painted it
and then BOOM this is right for my
brushes so I own three of these and
that's all my brushes that I keep here
um and that's an excessive amount of
brushes to have three of these I'm going
to be honest you don't need that many
brushes no one does but I also do a lot
of makeup here at my house on my friends
and family and stuff like that so I like
to have a lot of brushes also since I am
a makeup
I have done trial and error and button a
lot of brushes to see what I think are
the best which is why I'm gonna let you
know what I think is good I'm not going
to really talk too much about what I
think is bad I'm gonna try to focus on
the things I think everyone needs when
it comes to cleaning my brushes I use
one of two things I either use the matte
brush cleaner um yeah mine's empty like
gosh I have another one and I could not
find it anywhere so I'm sorry but this
is really great for spot treatment you
can put it in a bottle and put like a
spray on top and just spray out and spot
it your brushes if you're moving quickly
or if you're doing people back-to-back
and you know you're not working just on
yourself it's a great way to spot clean
um and like people are always asking me
how often I clean my brushes when I'm
using them personally I don't clean them
after every single use um now if I into
a bright blue eyeshadow I'm obviously
gonna have to clean that brush again
before next time and I'll just stop
treat it with this I'll put some on
paper towel rub it around and then put
it back in the can can of started one
call and let it dry um I only take my
brushes to the sink and actually deep
clean all of them depending how often
I'm doing makeup I would say once a week
to once every other week now once a week
is if I'm doing makeup every single day
now when it comes to freelance work if
I'm using my brushes on clients I will
take them to the sink and deep clean
them with a with a cleanser and then
afterwards I'll also use alcohol on them
to make sure that there is no bacteria
left where I'm not going to use the same
brush on another person's face when I
don't know what's going on with their
skin or their eyes until it is
completely cleaned when it's just me
though whatever um and then when I do
when I clean my brushes in the sink I
use purity face wash because this gets
every piece of dirt out of those brushes
and removes everything and they are so
soft and completely makeup free after
I'm done using this a lot of people also
say they can use like baby shampoo and
things like that I just really like the
purity I think that it's really easy
it's just a one step shop and you just
boom and it's done and then I'll take a
little bit alcohol on tissue it just
kind of like this for my freelancers
when I'm working on other people so that
is how I clean my brushes I'm trying to
think of anything else oh yeah Sigma has
this I think this is actually hilarious
it is literally an element this is I
needed so silly it really is I was being
honest with you it's a very silly thing
but it seriously works like it's great
like if you have a brush and you all you
do is you like dip this into some brush
cleaner and then you just go like this
and it's done I mean it's the same thing
is going like this but it just it takes
down the time by like half and you don't
get your hands all soggy because when
you're washing a hundred brushes or time
you get done your fingers are like
disgusting me premiere and dried out I
mean which isn't the end of the world
like come on but still like this is a
great way to wash and then you rinse it
off and then you kind of like reform it
by going like this and then you just lay
it out to dry so that's it is a great
tool it really is but it's not necessary
for the everyday person who just needs
you know like 5 to 10 makeup brushes but
it is Lotus okay so let's go on to make
it brushes the first two what I'm going
to talk about is a foundation brush now
I think that no matter what you are
looking for in your skins and your
foundation needs no matter the color of
your skin tone that's obviously not
going to make a difference if you're
looking for a full coverage sheer
coverage dewy finish a matte finish
satin finish whatever you're looking for
I think that this brush can fulfill your
needs and I think you know we're going
to talk about it's the Sigma f80 it is
the flat top kabuki brush and it is
synthetic so basically what synthetic
means I'm sorry that little hairs are
coming out this is fairly new okay so
basically what a synthetic brush is
going to do it's going to take all the
products and lay it on your skin okay so
if you have a natural hair product like
one like this and you go on foundation
it's going to give you a much more sheer
finish and the reason why is because
this is goat hair on top this is hair
from the belly of a goat no animals are
harmed they just cut the hair off the
belly of the go and then let them go run
free but they use that to make these
brushes so basically you to think of the
natural hair is like your hair so if you
put oil in your natural hair it's going
to soak it up it's going to grab it and
that's exactly what I'm natural hair
brush will do so here's a thing if you
take you know product on the back of
your hand and you dip it in there and
you go to your face this brush is going
to hold half of your product and it kind
of wastes your product um but when you
use a brush like this that's synthetic
it's not going to grab that extra
product it's literally going to take it
straight from your hand or straight from
the pump and put it directly on the skin
so you get to save a lot of products and
I really think that it looks extremely
natural especially because it's flat and
it's not um I don't know how to explain
this like one like this that shaped like
a painting brush one like this is going
to leave some streaks can leave some
lines it's kind of hard to blend I find
that even if I use this after I'm done I
still have like run over with my hands
maybe and just smooth it out or I'll
even going with this and smooth it out
but with this you don't have to use
anything on your face other than this
like you just go straight on you buff it
on you just do it everywhere you need to
do and it's done like it is so beautiful
and going hand in hand with the Sigma
f80 brush there are other brushes in
that line that Sigma makes like they
make the synthetic angled kabuki brush
the f82 which is the same brush but it
has an angle so you can see this is the
one I use for foundation and then this
is the angle one now I just got this one
I would say a year and a half ago but I
have this one flick a year before that
and this is what I use for foundation
and this still works because of the flat
top on it like it it still works it's a
beautiful brush foundation but when I
got this I found myself not reaching for
this one as often unless this one was
dirty and I just like this one a little
bit more just because of the flat like
complete flat head um but this one is
beautiful beautiful for contouring and
bronzer especially a cream bronzer or
cream blush I love this one I love it
because once again the synthetic hairs
don't steal the product so it deposits
it right on the skin and just bust it
out and it's really nice of this angle
because you can really get into that
contour line where you can really get
into that blush line and just buff it
around it it's an amazing brush also
they have the
angled kabuki and f88 this one is
completely flat so you can see that this
one is like a rounded flat and this one
is completely flat you can see the
difference this has more of like an
exaggerated angle to it and this one is
more rounded out I don't use this one as
much as I use this one but I do like it
I really like this one if I'm going to
do a dramatic contour I'll put the
product basically like right here on the
brush anywhere the brush is fine but I
put it mainly other side of the brush
and then I will take it and just
literally sculpt out my cheek so if I
like take a big brush and put some
bronzer on I'll take the same bronzer
and then just go like and make just in
one line just to give that like
indentation even more um indention
indentation oh my god I have to say that
when it comes to brushes Sigma Sigma
Beauty I think makes some of the best
quality brushes for their price and
there are so much like mac brushes but
they are so stinkin cheap it's like
there's no comparison as to which one
you want to get because of the price
point they're amazing and I use them all
the time now I have like every single
Mac brush in my kit and I have every
single Sigma brush really I mean not
every single one but almost when I'm
doing makeup on a client the big oval
brush of this one bag oh this is the map
224 now big wait no it's not this is a
sigma one like even i get the mixed up
all the time even working for mac for
the past 4 years I still can't even
really tell the difference because Sigma
is so similar ok so basically they like
changed big time because my memory card
was full and then I had all this stuff
happen and this is like an hour and a
half later so I'm sorry to confuse you I
think it's the best I shadow brush of
all time for packing color on all over
the lid so this color right in here that
I like that light shimmery color on the
242 by Mac I showed this brush in my Mac
haul video for my kit my freelance
I love this brush finger that's so flat
and it's just nice and dense and it's
skinny and because it's synthetic once
again it's going to pick up all the
product and just put straight on to the
lid it's not going to steal any of your
product from you so you're going to get
a lot of pigment with this I think that
everybody should own the 242 by Mac this
is one of the only brushes that I will
say that where Mac really really knows
their stuff this is a great brush and
the next you're going to need a good
blending brush um I
let's just talk in Mac terms if the Mac
217 is a really great one Sigma also has
one that's the exact same thing it looks
like this this is max this is Sigma it's
the same thing it does the same job
once again the Mac one is which is this
$25.00 I believe and this one is 12 it's
around 12 sorry my iPad left me at the
time that I was walking away it's back
in my bedroom but yeah this one is a
half of the price of the map one and
you're not going to tell the difference
it's a great great brush the third one
is going to be this one this is again
Sigma this is the e-40 Mac has one
similar I'm going to be completely
honest with you guys right now
the Sigma one absolutely out beats pills
Mac any day of the week the Mac 224 you
can see is so much skinnier this is the
Mac one this is the Sigma one you can
see it is so much skinnier and it has no
shape and form like the single one does
this is like so flimsy it's just like
skinny and when you feel it it feels
like there's not enough hairs in it and
it's like there's something missing and
whenever I use it I'm just like oh this
isn't doing what I wanted to do the
Sigma one is amazing it keeps its form
it's dense it blends so beautifully it
doesn't chop up your eyeshadow oh my god
I love love love this brush and this is
the e-40 so for eyeshadow brushes I
would say that these three are necessary
the
2:42 the Sigma e25 and the Sigma e-40
these are amazing now you could do the
Mac 217 in the Mac 224 but they're going
to be double the price and it's going to
be the same thing other than the fact
that one says Sigma and one says Mac so
that's just my honest opinion also a lot
of people ask me why I use this brush in
my videos the reason why this first of
all is a Mac brush this is a 224 I use
this because I can't stand the actual
224 s you can see the difference in them
this one is so much stiffer and more
dense and has more form and shape or the
224 regular doesn't now the difference
is this came in a holiday kit so you get
four brushes for $50 I know people go
crazy for those sets but really I think
it is so not worth your money because
Mac brushes are handmade and when it
comes out holiday kits they're machine
made and it's just it's cheap and things
like this happen and it's completely
broken and I super glued it and it still
just it's a hot mess but the reason I
like this is because this one for some
reason is dense because it being machine
made I don't know I like that but then I
mean I've never used this Sigma one up
until I would say a month ago I finally
tried it out oh my gosh I'm just like
yes I don't have to use this little
broken thing anymore this is amazing and
then next I'm going to talk about
eyeliner brushes in my eyeliner video I
use a Mac brush because I had not
discovered a better one the Mac brush is
just a hot mess this is the 208 that I
used and it's just it's flimsy and I'm
always cutting the hairs on it and it's
it's as little disaster I'm gonna be
honest with you once again I cannot say
enough it's the Sigma e65 it has so much
more shape so much more form it's so
much more dense
it's like stiff in a good way I don't
know if that makes sense let me hold
these up so that you can see them the
difference so this is the Mac one right
here any other one a Sigma you can see
this one is just so true to form I love
it because I've always had an issue with
my eyeliner whenever I do my eyeliner
I'm just like I get so frustrated
because that brush is just like it
doesn't part of color I feel like it
just flims us all over the place and
this one is just so perfect it's so easy
to do it like a nice line and you can
get like a sharp cat eye on that outer
corner I don't you can see but it's so
easy because of this brush it's just so
perfectly dense I love this brush and
this is ten dollars it's ten dollars and
I would spend 25 I just want to tell you
guys right now that if I were someone
who didn't have any brushes or I selling
a few brushes from the drugstore I
didn't know what to do I would buy a kit
that's what I would do I would invest my
money in a kit and I would invest my
money in a kit from Sigma Mack does not
sell kits which I don't know why they
really should um but Sigma has all
different kits and you can get online
and go under the complete kits I'll put
a link below and you know for the Sigma
Sigma Beauty website whatever anyways
and you can get on there and just go to
brushes and complete kits and you can
see all the different kits that they
have and see which one you think meets
your needs I was going to say if it were
me and I don't have any brushes I were
invest in a sigma premium kit this is
what I think that everybody would use
these brushes in here it's one hundred
and sixty-four dollars and you get 15
brushes which is insanity I think that
in a good way because I mean if you were
going to buy 15 brushes from Mac and not
to mention there's some big face brushes
in here I mean one brush in here alone
the exactly what Mac is $50.00 so I mean
to think about it if you were getting
the same brushes at mac cosmetics you
be spending at least 500 so I'm just
going to show you guys what happened
look what this looks like when you
receive it it's in a book it is in a
leather-bound book and it has a zipper
right up here and you open it up sorry
I'm in right angle right now and so my
arm might look a little fat you'll deal
with it so underneath all these flaps
are the brushes and it's two pages of
brushes so let me just go through them
really quickly to show you what you get
I think this is the best kit um right
here you have this big brush this is the
Sigma F 20 powder brush this is the same
thing I use for my bronzer in all of my
videos next is the Sigma F 25 this is an
oddly shaped brush Mac has one just like
this not many people gravitate towards
it but this again is for powder you can
do this I use this for blush sometimes
and all my brushes are dirty or bronzer
whatever you want it's just a powder
button blush brush powder brush oh my
gosh okay this is the powder brush or
for blush brush and this is the f10 this
is my favorite blush brush in the world
Mac makes one just like it
it's the 129 this is the short handle so
it can be like thrown in your purse it's
the exact same brush feel the exact same
does the same thing this one is on half
of the price it's an awesome blush brush
I like these brushes better than the
classic blush brushes that are the white
angled ones because this puts on such a
sheer wash of blush I don't really like
it I feel like it looks kind of choppy
it doesn't put enough pigment on I
really like this it blends it out
beautifully you can really work with it
gets a good amount of color on there
because why apply blush if you want it
to be so sheer that you can't see it you
know I'm saying then you get a lip brush
and it comes in a little compact that
way if you put it in your purse your lip
products aren't going to get all over
everything that's really nice then it
comes with the e45 such an amazing brush
Mac used to have one like this that was
discontinued this is such a great brush
it's really dense it's got a little
point to it it's really great to get
deep down in this area and here and
really if you're how do you fun with
like different looks in different colors
it's really great
point to get all in these areas it's a
great brush Mac should really bring it
back okay
820 again that makes the same one and
this one is really great for buffing out
under the eye area if you have eyeliner
smudging it up looks like that's just a
short little shader brush that's great
and then this is the exact same one is
the 212 from Mac I call the two one two
I use this brush for my eyebrows every
single day I also use this to pack on
eyeshadow or eyeliner really densely in
those lashes on the lower line it just
looks like this just a flat brush
extremely skinny from side of you then
it comes with the one I was telling you
about that looks just like the Mac 217
the blending brush that I think everyone
needs that it comes with the e 35 which
looks just like the Mac 2 - to which the
Mac 2 - 2 is 20 with taxes like $29 this
one I believe is 12 once again this is
just for that higher crease area this
gets in there blends things out nice and
easy
um there's so many blending brushes in
the world I know it can be overwhelming
but once you play with them you really
get the feeling for them you know the
smaller blending brushes the lower to
your lash line you want to use it and
then the bigger it gets the higher up
you want to use it so with this one I
like to use this in the mid crease area
and then I like to use the big fluffy
one for a higher up in here to blend it
out making sound echoes done and you've
got a tiny little eyeliner brush that
looks like this I will use these brushes
the e10 I only use it when I'm just
touching up on that liner I prefer an
angled brush or my gel liner once again
a nice brush if you like the skinny ones
with no angle then there's a concealer
brush the f75 looks like this Mac has
the exact same one
then we have the Sigma large concealer
brush f65 once again great for concealer
just buff this out put it underneath the
eye and then I always go over with my
fingers to blend that concealer into the
cheekbone I feel like really no brush
can do the under eye concealer like your
fingers can buff it out then we have the
tapered highlighting brush that f-35 I
want to talk about this for a second
because in all my videos I always set my
under
area with the powder now I use this one
by Mac the 225 everyone is always asking
me what is it where's it from it looks
like a painting brush I can't find it
Mac discontinued up a couple years ago
because that's what they do I don't know
why but this is what I use just because
I have it right here well I just
purchased some more Sigma brushes so I'm
not going to be using that anymore
because I love this highlighting brush I
love it it doesn't run as much pigment
as this one which is great because this
one that you have to be careful because
it puts on a lot so the highlighting
brush for all of you who are wondering
what I use when are my eyes to set that
powder from now on it's going to be a
sigma tapered highlighter f-35 amazing
I've been using it for the past two
weeks absolutely love it it's foolproof
okay two more brushes in here the large
fluff brush this is the e50 once again
Mac had it the same one cheaper
obviously I like to use this to pack on
color all over the lid I'm using the
light pigment or a color that I want to
take from lid to brow I usually use this
for highlighting my cheekbones which is
really precisely you get a highlight in
there down the nose all that and then
last one is a duo fiber blush brush this
is really nice if you want to give some
light wash a blush I like this one
better than I like these most of the
time it goes back and forth though but
this will just do a very light wash so
if you're young you know when you're
just starting makeup and your attention
moisturizer light pink blush kind of
girl this would be a great great blush
brush for you and now that we did that
and you see the premium kit I think that
that kit is amazing 164 dollars and
you're going to get basically everything
you need only thing this doesn't come
with is this little eyeliner brush and
this fluffy brush right here the e-40
and I think that you we need also the
Mac 242
I would get those three outside of that
kit and you have every brush you will
ever need like seriously every brush I
don't think you'll need anything of
course and the laptop
other than that though I really don't
think that there's anything else that
you would need unless you're going to do
like
dance makeup artistry has a precision
kit which these are great they come with
four brushes and then I think it's fifty
dot $49 I think 49 to $50 and these are
really great for people who want to be a
little bit more advanced in their makeup
application I really like these for
concealer I like the one that has an
angle for concealer on the eyes it's
just like these but in a smaller version
and so I really like how this buffs
under the eye area really beautifully
these are great for applying eyeshadow
primer concealer highlighting
highlighting down the bridge of the nose
I love contouring with this one right
here getting some color on the edge
contouring and sculpting out the nose
even a dense contour the cheeks under
the lip area I really really really like
these but this is for someone who's
going to be more advanced in their
brushes and not just starting off when
it's a touch base on the Beauty Blender
really quick I've gotten a lot of
questions from you guys about this
sponge it comes it's a lot smaller than
this you get it wet you hold it
underneath the faucet I squeeze squeeze
squeeze it and it gets larger in your
hand after a couple squeezes then I wrap
it a Kippur towel and just kind of go
like this and get off the excess water
and then I go with my foundation I use
this only on days when I'm feeling
extremely dry so I want the extra
hydration the moisture will give to me
the water will give to me I really like
this for concealer though under the eye
area I think this is one of the only
tools I don't have to buff out my
concealer with I really really love this
um if you guys want me to do a full
foundation routine using the Beauty
Blender and the Sigma brush in my
current foundation just let me know I
know you guys will probably tell me yes
because I know everyone is interested in
a foundation of how to get your
foundation to look the best in the most
flawless so the Beauty Blender is a
great sponge but if I could choose
anything in the world for my foundation
it would be the Sigma f80 it will not
disappoint you
and if it does send it back also when
you receive these brushes the first
thing I suggest to do is take them
straight to your sink deep clean all of
them with unlike a good face wash or
something
whatever you think shampoo and just I
really like to be rough with my brushes
when I first get them like literally I
just scrub scrub scrub them and I
come up because I want them to kind of
expand out a little bit I don't want to
be so dense out of just Shawn who's box
let them know you're working for me so I
take them to the sink and I just roughed
them up and I just kind of pull them out
let them air dry and then boom and then
after that they won't be they it's kind
of hard to manage them if you just get
them and just start using them i really
suggest that you clean them first and
they won't shut as much and they'll be a
lot easier to work with so yes that's
that I think that this completes that
brush video um I really hope that I
answered your guys questions any
questions please let me know in the
comments below I will put the link down
below for Sigma brushes a list with
every single brush that I talked about
you can go look at all their kits pick
out the one you think is best for you if
you any questions before you want to buy
or purchase anything please leave in the
comments below and I will try to answer
as quick as possible and I will also
list the Mac stuff that I put down below
with their link as well so yes I hope
you enjoyed this video I hope you
learned something and I maybe try to I
organized a little something in your
mind I don't know I just suggest getting
kits and a few extra brushes on the side
and then you'll be done for a couple of
years so yes I love you so much and I
will see my next video mmm bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
