really like become a problem I think
they can get stuck on stuff you like
slap it you yank it they fall out of
your ear you lose it at the club but
what can I say
Holman ain't easy all right you got to
be committed to the whole life and the
bigger the hoop the bigger the host you
know where I stand right okay I'm done
oh god you guys I have missed you so
much and I'm just gonna start this video
off by saying that how do I put this um
I am very aware of my absence and I know
that people are wondering where I have
been where I have been what I have been
doing what is going on I know that
there's a lot of rumors out there right
now about why I'm gone and everything
going on in my life and at this moment
I am just not comfortable talking about
it and I have been taking a lot of time
for myself and for the people around me
there is a lot going on in my life right
now not just one thing but there are
several things and a lot of people
really need my attention right now at
this moment and it has just been a very
very very difficult couple of months so
I just want to say thank you so much to
everybody who is constantly sending me
so much love and support even though you
guys don't know what's going on right
now I am still so grateful for
everything that you do for me and like
I've said a million times before I do
not even deserve the love and support
that I receive me on a daily basis but I
am so so so damn grateful so thank you
very much
and I will talk about what has been
going on as soon as I am ready and it
won't be that much longer I just need a
little time for myself and that's why I
haven't been filming because I have sat
down and tried to film probably in
between three to six videos at this
point and every single time I get 5
minutes into it and I'm just like I
can't do this and it just feels like I'm
lying to you and I'm not giving you my
best and I'm not even able to be myself
some days I just feel very drained right
now from everything going on you know
around me and to me and in my life and
my friends and family's life so anyways
I'm gonna say that I am sorry for my
absence and I love you guys so much but
today I felt like I'm in a good place
and I want to film so we're gonna do
we're gonna be doing my April favorites
video and I have a lot of stuff to talk
about and more than anything I have a
lot of lip products which is pretty
typical for me I'm so obsessed with lips
so let's just stop babbling and
jump into it man have you like skincare
type items and then makeup items what do
I want to talk about first I'm gonna
start off with the most basic thing that
I have but I have to talk about it
because I have mentioned it once before
I believe but the obsession has gotten
so beyond real and I always like to like
come back and revisit a product when
it's been like six months or a year and
I'm still right or die for it that means
it is the goat so this is by the brand
Campari and it's just a lip balm all
right and I say that like it's so simple
it's just lip balm no bitch it is so
much more than just a lip balm it is
hands down the most moisturizing
luxurious just like oily creamy lip balm
I've ever used in my entire life and I'm
a psychopath about lip balm because I am
so dry like my whole entire body my
scalp is dry and my hair is dry and my
under eyes shine my lips are dry and my
feet are dry so I always always keep
this in my nightstand because I cannot
go to bed with dry lips like I have to
put on a moisturizer on my list before I
go to sleep and I misplaced I don't have
my nightstand like three nights so I was
using like a little amaryl at balm
instead which of course is like so nice
and so luxurious and boozy my lips were
peeling after just three nights of using
that because it was so dry so this it
stands out to me and not only does it
make your lips feel so good and so
moisturize genuinely it also makes it
look so shiny looks like gloss so he's
put on it's like being your lips looks
soaking wet so anyways I know I'm
ranting very hard I love this I know
that a lot of people have been sponsored
by Copart but you know me I'm not
sponsored they have sent me some stuff
for free but I purchased these on my own
so I just repurchased this because I
love it so much and I'm so weird about
trying new skincare you guys know this
I'm a little bit more open to trying new
masks so my gets okay I'm only gonna put
my face like 5 to 15 minutes right like
it's a mask it can't do that much damage
even though I have had some masks do
some damage but I'm very worried about
trying new skincare this became a
favorite after the first time that I
used it I went through an entire jar
this is now my second one right here it
is by the brand glow recipe and this is
the watermelon glow sleeping mask I can
no longer go to sleep without putting
this on I do my entire routine from
beginning to end and
right what I'm normally done when I put
my moisturizer on it's time for bed
this is a very very very last thing that
I pop my face and I lather my face my
neck my declan's high I just I do it all
feels so good on my skin and not to
mention it literally smells like
straight like juicy watermelons the next
morning your skin is so soft and just
like so supple and buttery and I swear
my makeup goes on so much smoother I
love this stuff like it really makes
your skin glow and really gives like
that deep hydration
I'm obsessed and I'm pretty sure the
first person who I ever heard talked
about this was Jeffrey star and that's
why I ran out and got it cuz I was like
mmm I mean he's got my nose he's
beautiful skin in person so when he
recommends something I'm always like I
see you boom okay so I know that this is
very expensive for a face wash okay but
the reason I'm talking about this is
because you know that I have only talked
about one facial cleanser and one facial
cleanser only purity face wash has been
my jam right this is the lemare what
does it call just the cleansing gel you
can see how much I love it oh my gosh it
gets your face like squeaky clean but
not squeaky clean to the point that like
it's a cuz I hate that feeling when it
feels like you're like washing a window
you know I'm saying when it's actually
squeaky but I just feel like my skin is
so clean and just stripped I'm just like
every single piece of makeup it gets my
makeup off so fast and it foams up which
I love because like the purity is
definitely more like buttery and lotion
II in the sense like when you lather up
you don't get any suds this one like
suds and lather so you really feel like
you're like oh like getting everything
off I don't know what it is about it I
love the sensation of washing my face
with this and it gets my makeup off like
and for all my ballers on a budget out
there if you're wondering what face wash
to use from the drugstore
I've always recommended the brand
purpose it's just like a clear bottle
with like a blue
I think it's blue is like a blue stamps
its purpose on it that was always my
favorite drugstore face wash I always
loved it cuz it got off my makeup so
fast
it gave Mike a little sudsy I would say
it's a really good dupe for Lil
America's I know this is very expensive
and I know that your skin is important
but still if you can't afford it can't
afford it go to the drugstore and find
your purpose this kind of falls into the
skin category
I don't talk about this before - but
again this is now a product that I have
been using mmm ever since me and Jackie
filmed our drunk makeup tutorial which I
didn't know how many months ago that was
but this has now become a staple on my
makeup routine honestly I can't do my
makeup without this and this is the Lyla
be a glow face mist Oh
oh my god you guys but first of all I am
dry so that's why I love this so much
because it really gives you that glowy
dewy look now it doesn't make you as
dewy as the tatcha luminous dewy skin
mist which I have been in love with that
for years but the reason why I've been
using this so much more than that is
because of the pump on top so this one
the way it sprays out it's like this
perfectly fine even miss and it never
like on your face I just love this
it doesn't make you super super duper
ultra dewy but it just makes your skin
like your foundation just looks so
natural I just like buttery and just
melt it into the skin I always spray my
damp Beauty sponge when I'm applying my
foundation of my concealer and like now
that I have gotten used to doing that
with this product I can't live without
it like I have to spray my damp Beauty
Blender with this otherwise it's just
not happening like I rather not in a
wear makeup so dramatic
I'm gonna be honest you guys like look
at this here's an empty bottle right
here here's an empty bottle right here
and then we have this phone right here I
have gone through now four bottles it's
sad I'm going through these like they're
boxes of tampons just be honest what a
month okay I can't help with a heavy
Florida wide-set vagina but I've talked
about this product before I know I've
read about on snapchat but oh my god
again this is a product that I have been
using for months and I use it every
single night I'm obsessed
but it's called sleepy and it is a body
lotion by lush Oh bitch
it smells like lavender honey to me I
know it says that it's just lavender
scented to me oh so basically the like
whole thing behind us is it's lavender
it's supposed to relax you make you
sleepy get you ready for bed all that
jazz so because of that I only use it at
night came out a nice fall asleep I'm
like it is so moisturizing I'm gonna be
honest it does have a little bit of like
that grease
tendency but not like grody
but like perfect but when you wake up
you are so moisturizer so creamy you're
not still you're so greedy that was more
too much and way too explicit for
children they used to have a body wash
that the exact same scent and it was
called Twilight and I was addicted like
it made me take a shower every single
night because I was just like I have to
smell this body wash on my garden is so
bad and I'll use the body wash and then
I would use this right immediately
afterwards and I just loved it but they
said it was limited edition so it's not
available that's why I've been absent
from YouTube for so long because I've
just been mourning the loss of the body
wash
so more if you just recently launched
these blush palette so I'm gonna show
you this one first cuz it's my 100%
favor of course because it's those
warmer peach here orange your Coralie
tones and this is the let me see the 8w
it's called the warm master they just
redid their blush palettes because
before they were much smaller
they felt cheaper it was like one of
those things like I didn't even know
that it needed improvement until they
did it and I was like oh I don't even
realize that like it wasn't as good as
it could be because I just loved those
palettes so much but this is the aw and
this is the 8c and it's obviously the
pinkier guy right here now I am NOT like
a pinkie type girl
I definitely like these shades over
these shades but you do have those two
options or right here kind of a warmer
and a cooler set for whatever your vibe
is I know that a lot of people aren't
like horny for blush right now for some
reason like I feel like that's kind of
like gotten lost in the industry but I
personally like I can't live without
blush i nee blush
even on a day where I'm doing basically
no makeup I feel naked if I don't have
blush and highlight on my cheeks I
almost feel like blush to me actually no
I don't feel this way I know blush is
more important to me than bronzer like I
need blush just like my cheeks just like
get lost and like I have no life without
it like I love that blush you look
something I've been loving in these
palettes right here I'm just gonna stick
with morphe cuz I have one more product
that I am probably the most excited
about this entire video because I have
been using these for the past two months
off camera and off social media and
haven't they
talk about it because they we're not
launching until like right now
and they are the brand-new morphe
highlights and they are bomb this I
promise you they are so bomb and for the
price what I love about these the most
is that when you first apply it with
like one swipe it starts off very soft
like a glow from within but then once
you go over several times it's like boom
I get packs a punch so this is what I'm
wearing on my cheeks right now we're at
my cheeks my nose but in a corner my
brow bone it is all the morphe highlight
i think they're coming out with like six
shades if i believe so but my two
favorites for my skin tone personally is
the shade extra which looks like this
and then the shade
ohlet's which is right here and when I
first saw lit I was like I don't know if
I'm gonna like that cuz it's so yellow
toned but I freaking love it's like it's
like I said it's one of my favorites
these two right here so I have these
combined right now on my cheek that is
what I am wearing I want to show you
like what I mean by how they apply like
more subtle like you can see where
there's obviously a lot of pigment but
when you put it on the actual skin
initially like it's really not like BAM
like it's not scary because what I
realized is there's a lot of people out
there who don't want a blinding
highlight which I know I know when I
hear that sometimes I'm like oh looks
like what I don't understand but whether
you have fine lines and wrinkles or you
have texture and you're like it's secure
about it you don't to bring attention to
it those are very normal concerns and
highlight is going to bring attention to
those things like if you have something
on your face that you don't wanna bring
attention to then you're not going to
highlight it so there are a lot of
people out there who don't wanna put a
blinding have it on their cheeks and
that's why I appreciate highlights like
this it's because they're so buildable
that you can have both options so they
really work for a lot of different skin
types and a lot of different age groups
so that's why I love these so much not
to mention the price point not to
mention its morphe you know I love more
V so I'm pumped about these okay so I
have two brushes they're honestly
probably going to shake you guys to the
ground and be like really and it talked
bad about these products I know a lot of
the internet did I never talked about
about them I was kinda like
not worth it these two Kylie cosmetics I
know but these two Kylie cosmetics
brushes have been like my goat who's
recently like I've been obsessed so the
first one right here is like this
natural hair angled like flat top brush
which I really haven't seen a lot of
brushes shaped like this one and this is
number 11 I have an obsessive this for
my nose contour it makes it so quick and
easy and I love when things are quick
and easy and then this eyeshadow brush
in the number 13 I love this for my
under eye area when I'm buffing out and
also for like up here when something
just will not blend properly I grab the
number thirteen brush and i spects like
she's done like it's such a good brush
so all her other ones like after really
didn't have a fair shot I wasn't really
die-hard I wasn't really impressed there
were some of them that I actually really
didn't like but these two right here I'm
very impressed by and I've been using
them ever since she sent them to me
which has been a several months now at
this point and I love both of these so
much so I don't even know if she sells
them individually if they only come in a
kit hopefully she's something
individually because these two are
incredible next we have a pair of false
lashes and these are by avalor I
mentioned in my most recent get ready
with me that they sent a bunch of these
to me and told me that they were
inspired by me and creating this lash
which is so cool but that's not why I'm
talking about this I'm talking about
them because even if someone told me
they created a lash for me or inspired
by me if I didn't like them I want to
talk about them but these I'm like damn
they really know my style I love them
they're like my perfect everyday lash
we're like if I'm barely wearing any
makeup I can shake toss these on and
they pretty much look natural on me like
they're really really beautiful so it's
so cool they did that and I'm so excited
about it and I believe that these are
only sold on velour lashes calm and not
a Sephora I think so but here to slay
his name of them okay I only use this
twice alright so I'm just gonna say that
right now I cannot be a favorite use it
for you six months no look I've only
uses power twice but that's all I need
that is all I need when it comes to my
face I do not need to use something 50
times to know if I love it or not now of
course I could have a reaction to it
like I'm gonna breaking out a few days
but
it's gonna happen I've done twice and
I'm gonna go place so this is the new
hourglass Vail transit setting powder
but this is one of the most it's not the
most beautiful trenches of powder I've
ever used in my life it is so creamy I
just like want to pour it all over my
body oh my god it is so just like creamy
and butter you want to rub it on the
back of my hand it doesn't settle into
any of like my little fine line there
wrinkles that I have on my hand and it
just has like this beautiful glow to it
but it's not sparkly it's not like shiny
it's not glittery it just has it this
gorgeous luminosity like it just looks
so healthy and beautiful I'm obsessed I
am so obsessed I don't know when this
launches if it's launched yet I just got
it like I said I've only used it twice
it is just so beautiful and I know that
this is gonna be empty
very soon I'm gonna be purchasing it for
sure and I only use it twice and I
already know these things to see into
the future okay so I took a little break
before diving into my lip products
because I just got this video sent to me
from my niece who loves Miranda sings
and I am dying I can't oh my god she's
such a big fan of Miranda sings I
actually um took her in her so Thalia to
go see Miranda sings when she came to
Tampa and we had so much fun but like I
can't like that impression like that
anyways okay so let's just jump back
into it at this point all I have left
are lip products and you know that my
bitch ass has a lot I want to start off
with these right here first of all you
guys know that I love the Smashbox
always on liquid lipstick because I out
there :
yes they came out with a bunch of nudes
which I was so happy about because I
feel like some
is really missing in the cosmetic
industry in general it's just nude lips
I know it sounds silly cuz it's all I
ever talked about but I just like I have
a really hard time still finding my
perfect nude shade so every single time
if someone releases nude lips and
especially nude liquid lipsticks I'm
just like so these two colors are my
favorite personally for my skintone
the paler shade right here is called
fair game I love love this color and if
you're a lot darker in skin tone than me
this is a great shade to layer and put
like in the center of your lip but for
me when I'm really fair I love this like
it's that perfect
Oliver nude but it's not that like white
out like powdered sugar doughnut like
you've been doing some extracurricular
activity if you know what I mean
type a nude it's just like that perfect
kind of a pinky undertone a little bit
of Mavi a little bit of brown it's just
it's beautiful and then the second shade
that I wear when I have like a good
spray tan is the shade what is this
gotta light which on my pale ass right
now this is gonna look pretty Brown but
when I have a tan it is beautiful I do
have a favorite that I've only worn
twice because I just got sent this four
days ago I believe and it is the
Kourtney Kardashian in the kind of
cosmetics collab and this is a liquid
lipstick in the shade
kiss which is such a beautiful color I
love this shade right here it's got like
a peachy pinky undertone it's actually
similar to fair game by Smashbox which
is a little bit lighter in shade and
it's just so pretty like I was nervous
because I feel like Kourtney always
wears like a little bit of a darker lip
like not brown not too dark but I feel
like her skin tone so much darker than
mine that when I saw she was coming out
the nude shade in the collection I was
like it's not gonna be my shade it's
gonna like not flatter me cuz I like I I
don't know we all like a certain type of
nude right but this one is so beautiful
like it's not too peachy it's not too
pinky and it's not too Brown is it that
perfect center situation it's good you
guys have seen me use the sex color on
camera several times but I think I've
never really stopped and given it a ton
of love and I wanted to really give it
its moment because this is a color that
I have repurchased now twice and for our
liquid lipstick that is a lot for me
I can definitely that person who I'm
like once a bottle is done I'm like okay
I'm moving on to the next this one it's
like I can't get enough of it and it is
jeffree star cosmetics in the shade
mannequin and it is such a good nude
like I'm curious to see what it looks
like next to the other ones cuz I think
they're all so different okay so listen
listen let me explain myself I know on
camera that these three look a lot alike
but they're actually so different though
like mannequin definitely is paler and
Pinker than the rest of these like
French kiss by courtney and kylie is
definitely peachy err and fair game by
Smashbox is definitely like ma beer but
mannequin is just like that go-to
perfect all over pale pinky nude lip it
never fails me it doesn't matter how
dark my spray tan is it doesn't matter
how fair I am mannequin always comes
through it always rides dirty for me I
love it like I said this is my second
bottle which is a lot because I really
don't repurchase much I'm always like
wanting to try something new this okay
so let's talk about gloss because I have
one two three four five glosses and then
we are done so the first ones are the
dose of color glosses they came out with
several shades maybe like two months ago
I would say and these two colors I am
beyond beyond obsessed so the one that
I've been wearing the absolute most is
the lightest fairest color that came out
with of course because I am so pale like
I am so white that I always like the
pale of shades for sure I like know a
lipstick on my teeth this one is called
can you not and it is just so pretty
they're so glossy there's the perfect
amount of thickness like they're not too
thick but they're not they're not too
thin other shade is called on repeat and
this one is definitely a darker shade
right here I don't know if you can see
by the swatches but I really don't have
a gloss to compare these two they're
kind of similar to the Marc Jacobs lip
glosses kind of but not not really and
they're not as thick as I can anastasi
lip gloss if you do it by itself without
anything else on the lips you can get
like a light wash of color
also you can really like pile it up and
make it very glossy and very pigmented
which is why I love them so much so
those two shades I have been all about
them
so Patrick Starr collaborated with Matt
cosmetics and I absolutely loved
Patrick's so I was so excited for this
collection and it's just so cool that he
is a boy in makeup who started at Mack
and was just like so kicked down in the
beginning of his journey and now he has
a collection with them so excited for
him like it's such a cool collaboration
like it's one of the most exciting
collaborations for me personally in the
industry as someone who started at Mack
and just like watching his journey I'm
just so happy for him and is proud and
just like it's just so cool to like be a
part of what's happening in this
industry and I'm just I'm very excited
about it but anyway there's two glosses
that he came out with that I had been in
love with and this one right here I love
the packaging by the way like this
hollow Patrick Starr and Mac right here
and then the silver cap it's just so
cool and this is the shade she better
work I love him God it is the most
beautiful like gorgeous pale pinky gloss
like I when I open this up and I swatch
them the first time I was like thank you
Patrick like I love it so this next
shade by Patrick and Mac I actually
don't know what it's technically called
because they put like a little stamp
right overtop of it so all I can see is
it has the word kiss in it but I can't
see the first word but it is just this
beautiful sparkly lip gloss which I feel
like sparkly lip glosses are really
difficult because they can be so gritty
and they can't like break up and it
feels like you just have like a loose
glitter all over your lips and it's
uncomfortable and I'm fine with a little
uncomfort it's gonna look pretty but
some of them are so uncomfortable and
I'm like I can't do this but this one is
not like that and honestly this pains me
because I feel like when I swatch it you
can't see it it makes me sad like over
top of a lipstick it is so shiny and
just like metallic and glittery and
glossy and then the last gloss that I
have is the Laura Lee and color pop
collaboration which I don't even know if
this is still available I'm gonna be
totally honest I have not looked into it
I really hope that it is because this
gloss is in the shade Wham and it's like
this beautiful very similar to Patrick's
in the sense like I wear this over top
of other lipsticks this one
much more of a golden like honey based
so if you have more of a tan you don't
need a tan Taurus I'm gonna be honest
you can wear it when you're extremely
fair but still like I hope you can see
on camera how beautiful this shade is
like it is like that perfect like summer
time just like glowy honey like JLo
kissy lushy lips vibe like I'm obsessed
and that completes my April beauty
favorites I hope that you enjoy I need
to go wash all this off right now before
it ends up all over my hair and all over
my body
but I hope that you enjoy and I will
make sure to list everything in the
description box right below this video
for you because I know that I can talk
very fast and you might not really keep
up with the names and some things I was
