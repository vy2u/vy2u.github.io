my April favorites which is so crazy to
me because today I had to write out the
date and I had to write 5/1 and I was
like fine we're a month fine like that's
crazy to me this is like the fastest
year that of all time it is just like
Fallone by I feel like it was Christmas
like a week ago except it wasn't so I'm
going crazy so if you follow me on
Instagram and Twitter then you may have
possibly seen a picture that I posted
about five days ago and in that picture
I said I had a little surprise coming up
for you and I also tweeted about it and
first of all let me just say the
comments that I receive and the tweets
that I got about what my little surprise
could possibly be was absolutely
hilarious okay first of all so many of
you literally thought I was pregnant I
am not pregnant
that's not happening people but let me
just say if I were pregnant I would not
announce it by saying I have a little
surprise for you
with a duckface picture like that's not
a cute way to announce a new child being
brought into this world oh and the other
one was everyone thinking that I either
had plastic surgery or was going to have
plastic surgery no plastic surgery
happening either so I will tell you what
the surprise actually is and I'm super
super excited about this and I have been
waiting on pins needles to tell you so
without further ado the little surprise
is that I have teamed up with color your
smile and created my very own lip gloss
I am so overjoyed about this you have no
idea okay first of all before I start
going on a rant about how much I love my
life where it's gonna let me give you a
quick little story if you guys watch
youtube videos on the daily or weekly
I'm sure you have seen somebody one of
your favorites recently talking or
mentioning about color your smile
glosses the nude shade is the most
popular shade and for good reason it's
absolutely beautiful hold on I feel like
I have lipstick on my teeth they are
these lip glosses that have a little
mirror on the side so you can see how
you are applying it and then it has a
light right here so even when you're in
the dark you can see what you're doing I
know it's fabulous color your smile
honest to God has the best lip gloss
formula pretty much like I've ever used
their formula is amazing it is rich and
consist
see luxurious opaque creamy moisturizing
buttery doesn't dry out the lips and is
absolutely gorgeous it doesn't have a
foul scent it doesn't leave that white
ring around your lips that so many
glosses can do it is just absolutely
beautiful so I was talking to lightning
lightning about this whole situation of
all their losses because they have some
glosses that are blue and purple and
black and then they have these amazing
nude and I'm like you guys are missing
the perfect color of rose and your lip
gloss line and they were like do you
want to create it with us and I was like
um yes I do
so color your smile and I teamed up had
a baby and I named her Rose hill because
I personally think this is the perfect
shade of rose and then I incorporated my
last name and what doesn't sound more
pleasant than a hill of roses so I am
wearing this applause right now on my
lips I have it mixed with the color your
smile nude lip gloss I will tell you
behind the development of this gloss the
reason that I thought that a roche was
so important is because as a
professional makeup artist when you're
working on 10 to 15 clients a day like
boom boom boom girls popping in and out
of your chair a rose gloss was such a
staple of mine because depending who you
are working on you have to go through so
many different colors for so many
different skin tones and so many
different people's want to meet but a
rose color gloss can be mixed with any
color and just transformed into what you
want and your preference this can be
mixed with a red it can be mixed with a
raspberry it can be mixed with an orange
lipstick a nude lipstick a pink lipstick
a hot pink lipstick and whatever you mix
this with it is just going to completely
transform the shade I honestly think
that anybody will enjoy this shade it
has so much pigment in it you can see
right there that's literally one drag
across the back of my hand it is just so
rich and consistency it is absolutely
beautiful so I'm going to stop talking
about this you guys can go check it out
on the website for yourself and see more
pictures of it and stuff I just
absolutely love it I will be doing a
blog post on it soon so you guys can see
more colors and swatches of it and of
course I will show you how I like to
wear it I mix it with tons of different
colors I haven't wearing it non-stop for
the past couple of weeks and I
definitely have my favorite colors I've
been mixing it with for a different look
on day to day basis so I will put all
the links that down below you can buy
individually or you can buy it in a
bundle of four glosses it's my four
favorite glosses they put it together in
a little pack there's also discount
codes for you guys to get 25% off so do
not pay full price for these things use
the 25% discount codes it will save you
a lot of money so yeah I hope that you
guys enjoyed this gloss whoever tries it
please tweet me Instagram me show me the
pictures you guys have no idea how much
I love senior pictures how much I love
seeing your support you guys just
seriously means so much to me I feel
like I tell you that any chance I get
like one of these days I'm gonna come
out with nothing but a 30 minute video
he's being like I don't know okay let's
get into the favorites since we start
off in a gloss I'm just going to keep
rolling on the lip product train and the
first one I want to talk about I
mentioned in my New York City Hall and
these are bite Beauty lush fruit lip
glosses in the shade peach and rambutan
I can't decide which one I like better
so I'm showing you both again let me
just say one of the reasons why I love
by beauty so much is because all of
their ingredients are all organic and
all natural so you can literally eat
their products if you want to their are
filled antioxidants and just amazing
goodness for you
so in these are literally real fruit
real coconut real strawberry real mango
I can't remember all of the ingredients
in this but because of that they smell
like straight-up fruit obviously that's
exactly what you would expect so the
color peach is not peach whatsoever it
is a beautiful baby pink it's so pretty
even by itself
it's not super opaque so I prefer to
wear over a lipstick because I just like
my lips to be an opaque shade unless I'm
wearing something like Rose Hill where
it's more of just like a natural color
then it can be more sheer but when it's
like a pink or a nude I like it to be
opaque meaning I don't want you to see
through it if that makes sense okay and
then this one is rambutan and this is
the nude shade I love this nude gloss
this is like my favorite new gloss ever
right now they are both just so pretty
and mixing them together is a whole
nother world of amazing I felt like that
swatch just sucks so I wanted to show
you one more time okay we good we go
this is the Josie Maran Argan
Finity lip and cheek creamy oil I will
tell you right off the bat I have not
used this on my cheeks because I just
know products well enough and I know
myself well enough that I know I'm not
gonna like this on my cheeks but I do
love it on the lips it of course has
argan oil in it because it's josie maran
and it just blends out so beautifully
it's such a light wash on the lips I
have won this on days without makeup on
and it's not overwhelming because it's
such a light flush of color it smells
good and it is so moisturizing so on a
day where you wake up and your lips are
just dry dry dry being dehydrated and
yours going to do a quick makeup look
this is one of those lip colors you
would want to wear because it's really
going to penetrate deeply into your lips
and moisturize while giving you a pretty
color another lip product is the OCC lip
tar OCC is just short for obsessive
compulsive cosmetics but who's got time
for that this is in the shade hush this
is the perfect nude ever it is so opaque
the great thing about lip tars is
literally like a quarter size of a pea
and that's almost too much like it just
goes so far you get so much bang for
your buck I don't even know anyone who
actually ran out of one of these unless
you're professional makeup artist using
it all the time on tons of clients it is
just beautiful it's so opaque so much
pigment so creamy the scent is just the
end-all-be-all it's like the perfect
fresh minty set I love it so depending
the color of your skin if you're super
super fair this is going to be a pink if
you're my shade is going to be a pinky
nude and if you're darker than me that
it's just going to be a very nude color
it is absolutely gorgeous I love this
shade I have been using it all month
long I've owned it for a while and I'm
pretty sure it's going to go rotten
before I can use it all because these
literally lasts forever
okay last lip color and this is an oldie
but a goodie this is my third tube of
this shade and this is Mac Japanese
maple this is a cream Sheen color so
it's not going to be super opaque and
super pigmented but it is just a
beautiful beautiful nude it's very
creamy on the lips I use this and i
think one tutorial this month but i have
worn it constantly i mix it with rose
hill
that's on my favorite ways to wear that
gloss is with this underneath of it it
is just beautiful it's one of those
colors that is going to look good on
pretty much every single person unless
you are extremely extremely dark you can
rock this color it is just the perfect
nude okay really again I didn't give you
a proper swatch okay there we go is that
better yeah you could on my knee game
this lip balm is literally like just
stopped me dead in my tracks so obsessed
with this lip balm I cannot even get
over it
it is the sugar advanced therapy lip
treatment let me just say that I'd use
sugar lip treatment before but I use the
one that had SPF 15 in it and my lips my
skin my body does not like SPF for some
reason it always makes my skin in my
lips red like a red
ringy rash it's just irritating so I
don't wear SPF unless I'm going to be in
the Sun because it just irritates my
skin I can wear like in foundations and
stuff like that but not in lip balms for
some reason it just irritates me so
anyways my sister was down in Florida
last month and she pulled this out and
she's like oh do you need some and I was
like oh no I'm sorry I don't like the
SPF in it and she's like this doesn't
have us yeah so that became a love
affair with the sugar lip treatment
advanced what is this huh literally
obsessed that's all I have left in a
month and a half
not even like five weeks this Urban
Decay eye shadow and easy baked has been
my favorite eye shadow pretty much all
month I've worn it constantly every day
I find an excuse to wear it I have it on
my eyes right now blend it out with just
the typical Browns it is just so
beautiful it's the perfect gold color
with can you can see that there we go
it's the perfect gold color that is not
too yellow because sometimes you can get
some gold that literally just looks like
they're yellow this one is such a crisp
beige gold it's just a gorgeous
highlight if you are a few shades darker
I don't know why I'm talking to you like
this right now if your view shades
darker and skintone the meat you could
use this as a brow highlight or a cheek
highlight it's just absolutely gorgeous
I've been wearing it constantly this
month I have owned this next product
like a year in Sephora still has it
which I was so excited about I have been
using it
constantly this past month and it is the
laura mercier shimmer block and peach
mosaic this is such a beautiful
beautiful product and what I love about
it it is so Universal and you can use it
in so many different ways depending on
your skin tone you can use this as a
blush over your blush or as a
highlighter what I love about products
like this is you can put a matte orange
blush on and then put this over it and
then you can put a matte pink blush on
and put it over it and it's going to
look two completely different colors
because of the blush underneath of it
that's shining through it is just
absolutely gorgeous when you mix all the
shades together because it's like four
blocks of shades you know that deal when
you mix it together it is this gorgeous
rose gold let me let me show you is so
pretty it is just this beautiful copper
and it just makes your cheeks glow it is
so so gorgeous I have been using this
all month on it's what I'm wearing today
I have a foundation that I love which is
always a big deal because in the makeup
world foundation is like jeans it is so
difficult to find the foundation that
you just absolutely love so it's always
very big moment for me and very exciting
when I have a foundation to talk about
and this is by the brand co Jen do I
believe it is I don't know I will link
it down below for you guys along with
everything else and this is the aqua
foundation and I am shade one two three
it is so pretty this is celeb sephora
it's not sold at my sephora i had to get
this online but it is sold out so for us
it is so beautiful this is a natural to
a dewy finish it is so pretty on the
skin it is in between sheer and medium
but it is buildable so this is not a
full coverage foundation this is not
something that anyone who super oily is
going to love this is someone who has
combination to normal to dry skin that
can do this and it is a sheer to medium
which is perfect perfect perfect for the
summer time because sometimes I'm not
crazy about tinted moisturizers
especially because they tend to have
high SPF in them like I said sometimes a
high SPF can irritate my skin and
foundation so I love foundations like
this they're just absolutely beautiful
on the skin they look like skin and it
natural and every spring and summer I
embrace a more natural foundation not
such like a full-coverage intensified
foundation this product is by Gerard
cosmetics and it's called BB +
illuminates weight BB + illumination
this was formulated as a BB cream to use
all over the face I do not use this by
itself as a BB cream on my face but I
use it in many different ways I will
apply it all over the skin and then go
on with a really light foundation on top
or I will put it on the high points of
my cheeks on top of my foundation or I
will mix it in with my foundation so I
use it three different ways I love them
all different ways that it is so pretty
ok let me again fix the lighting it
literally looks like liquid gold on the
skin it is so fine as I'm blending out
it just feels like a moisturizer it just
feels like a luxurious lotion it doesn't
feel chunky there's no glitter in it I
am wearing this mixed in with all of my
foundation right now I have been using
it all month long it has not been
breaking out or irritating my skin it
doesn't settle the fine lines it's just
beautiful I have two masks to talk about
and the first one is that Perricone MD
and it is the chloro Plasma this came
out last month and I have been using it
constantly along with the second mask
I'm going to talk about I absolutely
love this let me just like tell you what
the website says because I can tell you
what it makes me feel but let me explain
what the website says because there's a
lot it is for deep detoxification and
cleansing of the skin the mask addresses
loss of radiance
Dahlan fatigue skin enlarged pores fine
lines and rough skin texture yes just
yes like it is absolutely amazing and
what's really cool about it is it's like
a super super pale pale green but then
when you're putting on your skin it
starts to activate and it gets a dark
green it's so cool I love it when I wash
my face my skin looks so radiant it
feels so deeply cleansed it is amazing
and well worth the money you just put a
tiny bit
and it spreads out so generously it
looks like you're only getting a tiny
amount but it feels like there's so much
in here I have used it tons of times and
barely any is gone so I love the pair
upon MZ chloro plasma yes no you guys
told me I was gonna love this mask and
you were 100% correct it is the origins
clear improvement active charcoal mask
to clear pores clear pores clear pores
to me this is like a less intense baby
version of glam glow glam glow I feel it
goes in is like pulling everything out
this I felt like was a little bit more
gentle on my skin and it almost like it
was moisturizing my skin while it was
pulling everything out I did feel when I
took it off like my skin looked clearer
I did feel like my pores actually got
smaller
I don't struggle with huge enlarged
pores but I have issues in the t-zone
like everybody would not there's some
people who are literally like what's
where's your pores
I do have pores there that are solid
like the loo so lightly enlargen girl
get it together and this I really feel
like makes a difference I have been
going back and forth between these two
masks for the past month and I just love
them both the Josie Maran model citizen
whipped Argan body butter oh this is
limited edition so I will be going back
and buying probably one or two more of
these just because I'm not ready to let
it go it smells so amazing I wish to so
bad I could hold this up to the camera
and how do you guys smell it it is so
fresh but yet warm - I don't like things
that are too warm like when you smell
like caramel and popcorn it's like
that's too much this is like vanilla
with freshness at the same time it
really does moisturize it's a beautiful
butter it soaks in it doesn't leave me
feeling greasy or sticky I hate that
because I lather myself before I go to
bed at night the last thing I want is
getting in my sheets 5 minutes after I
put body butter on and I'm like sticking
to my sheets like that's disgusting so
this is great it really doesn't waster
eyes it doesn't leave me feeling
absolutely sticky I mean you're gonna
feel really moisturize maybe a little on
the sticky side for the first five
minutes but then you're good to go but
that's just me because I put like a
pound on mmm Aspen at least this is the
misty or blooming bouquet perfume I love
this perfume I don't know when it came
out I don't know how old it is I know
nothing about it
all I know is it smells amazing it is so
fresh but yet there's warmth in it and
I'm actually kind of surprised I like it
because I typically don't like really
florally things this is just oh you can
wear this day or night I hate talking
about perfumes because I just want to be
like smell it but it is so good I
recommend if you guys are anywhere where
they sell mists your bloomin bouquet go
take a whiff this is so lovely
I use the original Miss Dior anytime me
and my husband go on a date my husband
and I go on a date because I just feel
like it is such a date night appropriate
sense this I wear a day and night I
absolutely love it it's fresh but yet
it's warm at the same time it's so
feminine and so perfect for this time of
year so miss your blooming bouquet
