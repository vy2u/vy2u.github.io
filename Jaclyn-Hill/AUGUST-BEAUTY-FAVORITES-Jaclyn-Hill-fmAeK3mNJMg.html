I have so many products to you today
like it is no joke I'm going to address
the obvious I'm in a totally different
place I'm in LA right now currently I've
been here for a way too long
I miss John and my dogs so much I
literally dream about him every single
night like all my my dreams from the
time fall asleep that's how I wake up
are just filled with John I'm like I
feel like I'm a teenager again like we
used to be long distance and I'm just
like like I think I'm gonna cry when I
see him um anyway he's starting to be
all mushy I have somebody talked to you
guys today it's absolutely insane that's
number one number two is I cannot
believe that we're entering fall like I
can't believe it's here I can't leave
we're in September like where does the
time go
are you joking is like call me is right
on the corner which needs hocus pocus
pumpkin spice lattes even though I don't
like pumpkin spice lattes I know don't
come for me I know I like pumpkin spice
candles oh I'm so excited I love all so
much here in LA like it's getting really
really chilly at night like I'm so
Florida that it gets out of like 16 I'm
like oh I'm going to put it up along
scars and it's so nice it's so nice okay
anyways okay I have so much talked about
all over here to decide let me hold okay
hold on I quickly apologize for the echo
the lighting whatever it is is just a
one-time video here my eye um obviously
since I'm in LA so I'm sitting in the
bathroom right now I'm sorry that not
everything is perfect but whatever who
cares okay you guys so I have a new
favorite primer foundation and concealer
which is like so exciting as such a big
deal because those are three major
staples and I'm not joking these aren't
just my favorites of the month I feel
like these just went to the top of my
list overall so the first one is the
primer and this is by LC cosmetics and
it is the pearl radiance primer oh my
gosh I have no cap you're going to see
this video
nothing has a cap
every literally when I look over there
right now I see a setting spare with no
cap powder with no cap a lipstick was no
Catholic it's the ongoing joke
everywhere all my caps are going this
primer is truly one of a kind of what
makes me say that the fact that it is
luminous and gives radiance while still
smoothing the skin and truly act like a
primer all the same time I feel like you
either get the moisturizing radiance or
you get the smoothing primer that
mattifies the skin but this I feel like
it truly does it all it's so hydrating
it doesn't give any sparkle or glitter
to the skin but it just makes your skin
radiant but it also smooths out fine
lines and it like acts like glue and
really doesn't a primer supposed to do
and helps extend and prolong your
foundation before foundation you guys
I'm not kidding this foundation has got
to be in my top three favorite
foundations of all time and this is the
hourglass vanished stick foundation oh
my gosh this is so amazing that it's the
only foundation that I brought me to LA
which is crazy because I come for a
two-week trip I bring like five
different foundations I'm crazy like
that I'm like well I might want this
whoa like this is the only one I brought
I brought in three different colors
though of course because my spray tans
gives a fade off so like I got a very
very different change so the three
different colors I'm going to be when
I'm out of town looks like this like a
little triangle shape when it rolls up
it reminds me a lot of the makeup
forever stick foundation not just
because their sticks but because of the
finish they give the difference is the
outlast one it has more coverage to it I
think the hourglass one is definitely
thicker
um which if I heard someone say that's
me I did okay I'm not gonna like that
but applying it it just feels so
beautiful blends out so nice it's not
streaky it's just it's gorgeous it
wasn't the top of my list like that okay
next for concealer everyone's been
raving about this concealer so of course
I had to try it you guys see me use it
in several videos I believe and this is
the tarp shape tape concealer oh my god
this is so long it is super full
coverage if you are looking to cover up
those dark circles this is your
concealer right here it is so full
coverage it's creamy it's definitely not
blendable as some concealers I think
urban decay concealer chokes at my own
selects typical the urban decay
concealer is definitely easier to blend
in my opinion because of the fact that
it is more of a thinner consistency a
little bit watery this one dries a lot
faster and it's a lot thicker therefore
it gives you crazy full coverage it
lasts so long but it's a little more
difficult to blend but it's not anything
that would complain about like it's
amazing this is actually the only
concealer that I brought with me to LA I
left my Urban Decay one at home which is
crazy because I have been ride-or-die
for that concealer for so long but this
one I don't want to say it's me place it
but it's kind of replaced it so let's
talk about highlighters they want to be
a favorite to do about some highlighters
right right so the first one is an oldie
but a goodie however if I told you guys
here on YouTube showed you guys all
about my move on snapchat
I moved my entire makeup collection back
to my home I moved it to my office
maybe like out of those a year ago
almost a year ago with my whole
collection to my office my beauty space
and I just haven't been feeling like I
was in such a rut and feeling still
under inspired for several months and I
realized that it's because my makeup
collection wasn't with me my house every
night I use like going to my Beauty room
sit down play with products touch them
feel them do my makeup and then wash my
face and go to bed and I don't do that
anymore because all my stuff is over at
my office
that kind of was making me feel like
makeup was like work like it was my job
it's like I would go to my office do
work there and then have my makeup there
and it just made it feel like oh I don't
know so I brought my entire collection
back home and I swear I've never been
happier how do you mind made a
collection back in my house like I feel
like makeup is fun again I've been going
back through my old products and
discovering them as if they're new and
so I'm rambling but it's it's just been
so good for me to have my makeup back in
my house and I fell in love for another
time with the ball mary lou manizer
highlighter i don't know why i've ever
put this down it is so amazing this
color is just so gorgeous I had on my
cheeks today mix with some champagne pop
it's a very light vanilla shake you can
see right there so beautiful if you're
fair looking for a highlight this is
just gorgeous I just love mixing it with
champagne pop and Prosecco pop because
it just I don't know there's something
about the combinations it's just like so
magical to me but I just love this so
much it's such a good staple highlight
and it's a great color to use for your
brow bone and your inner corner of your
eye as well okay so speaking of
highlights I have shelby's on camera
before I want to talk about my two
favorites and these are the Becca
cosmetics split hands that they came out
with over a month ago
featuring champagne pop and Prosecco pop
which of course is so exciting I never
get used to that I swear this one right
here is half champagne pop will get out
of Sun half champagne pop and half
flower child which when they told me
that they were going to put champagne
pop and flower child together
I like freaked out because flower Chow
has been one of my favorite blushes for
years so to know that they're going to
put it next to champagne pop I was like
okay it was so excited and then this one
is half pomplamoose and half Prosecco
pop there are two other ones there's a
total of four but these are my two
personal favorites I know that the
Prosecco pop and
reto is like the top seller everyone
dies for and I love it too but these are
my two number ones that I use constantly
let me show you swatches really quick if
you like I just suck as much as I always
forget so this person right here is
champagne pop and flower child she has a
pause right there and a flower child is
right next to it and then right below it
I'll put Prosecco pop and pop a loose a
little bit smaller
Prosecco pop right there and then
Pomplamoose right next to it so those
are my two fates
I really love this concept like even
though I've seen split pan before like I
think this is just so cool and I hope
that Becca keeps doing these they
haven't told me anything about it but I
hope to thing do have highlighters like
half opal and half moonstone would be
sick alright let's talk about me I have
so many lip products you guys sort of
across they're talking out eyes first so
in this first product I'm going to be
honest I've only used it once oh I can't
see her say I love my eye like a bar but
I just am so in love with this concept I
think it's so different and so just
creative so I just want to talk about it
more than anything I've used it one time
and I was like oh and this is by the
brand touch insole and it's called the
medallist liquid oil and glitter shadow
duo so on one end it's liquid foil in
the other end is a loose glitter like oh
look at this swatch right here look at
how a metallic that is now let me show
you what it looks like when you layer it
because you put this one down first and
then you put the glitter right over top
of it oh my god this is so beautiful
so that right there is with the glitter
over top of the liquid foil is that not
ridiculous they only had it in one color
all the other ones were sold out I think
there's a total of five colors this is
the only one that could grab and this
morning I saw that there were two other
colors in stock and although
because I bought them so fast so now I
have two pairs of false lashes I have
been obsessed with if you follow me on
snapchat you probably know it's coming
the first is by the grand blinking view
in the style Samantha and Samantha here
on YouTube and Instagram she got 3s in
the front of her name like Samantha
she's so beautiful she is going to
collaborate on these and did such a
beautiful job they're not brand new like
they've been out for a little while I
got their limited edition or her
permanent I don't know the deal there
but I hope they are permanent because
they are perfection they're what I'm
wearing my eyes right now I'm using um
so you can see what they look like right
here they are crazy fluffy and probably
kind of intimidating to some people but
what's so great about them is they are
like really separated and fine on the
inner corner and they go from shorter to
longer to thicker to bowler so it just
gives it such a beautiful like winged
cat eye with your lashes and one of you
can see in very well on my eyes right
now in this lighting they're so pretty
the next pair I have been reading about
these for months they're so beautiful
and they are thus Layla lashes by
flutter it's funny both of these are
actually in collaboration with youtubers
so make it by Shayla collaborated on
these with flutter and oh my gosh she
did such a good job because they are so
beautiful let me show you again zoomed
in what these look like like they are so
dramatic they've got all the fullness of
the face and they're super wispy and
separated as they come out and these are
freakishly comfortable like freakish
they're so long and dramatic but they
just feel so good on your eyes these I'm
not even trying to be funny I think I've
bought close to 50 pairs of them ok so
let's move on to lips because the
lighting is going down at the Sun is
about to completely disappear and then
we're screwed because I
lighting it we're just using the natural
windows open so the first lip product is
something I've owned for a long time but
bringing my makeup collection back to my
house I rediscovered it and I've been so
in love I've been using it constantly
and it is a colour-pop lippie stick in
the shade skimpy and it's a really
really nice pale nude and it's a glossy
new which I really like because I don't
not crazy about fully matte nude you can
see it's very pale actually let's go a
similar when I'm wearing my lips right
now but I'm not wearing this actually
it's so pretty and it's super
inexpensive like the price is all right
I love these color pop lip you sticks
truly I'm not so much of a fan of the
matte ones but I love the glossy ones
they're very comfortable they feel
really nice on my lips I'm really
moisturizing and I just love this color
for in everyday nude I think it's so
pretty so speaking of color pop this is
a colour-pop liquid lip and
collaboration with kathleenlights and oh
my god she did such a good job on this
color I am obsessed in the shade point
zero it is I'm just going to like one
little tiny baby swipe you can see how
beautiful this is let me make like a big
swatch so you can really see it it is
such a gorgeous shape got some gray
brown undertones to it it's not too dark
not too pale it's just beautiful every
single time I wear it I cannot believe
how many people are snapping and
tweeting asking what shade it is and I'm
like dang girl you did such a good job
it's just a standout color it's so
beautiful next the products I'm going to
talk about you guys are probably gonna
be shocked by this is I am shocked that
I have been loving me so much because my
first experience with this product was
not good but I've had a change of heart
and no I'm not being paid to say this
I'm not doing this to kiss ass I was
talking about this because I like this
product and that's it these are the
Kylie cosmetics lip glosses I have 4
different shades here and these are
actually the only glosses that I brought
with me to LA other than Marc Jacobs
it's sugar sugar because I found that
these about a week or so before I got on
the plane to come here and I'm
I'm genuinely attached to these like I
love them they're by me a lot of the
Anastasio glosses they're very thick
they're very pigmented when I first
tried them I only tried one and it was I
believe yeah I think I only tried one
and it was coke okay which is like the
pinky shade and it was so movie like I
went and it was like like strings and
blobs and I was like no thank you and I
did not like it and I moved on well they
sent me another PR package and this time
around bah like I love them and I went
back and I found some of the originals
that they sent me and I liked some of
those too so I don't know if there was
like an inconsistency of what it was or
if you change the formula I don't want
to keep up with the formula updates on
Kylie cosmetics but I love these four
shades right here I'm wearing this one
right now and this is the shape so cute
this one is the palest one of them all
it looks like that right there I have it
on my lip so you can see I have like a
really super nude lipstick underneath of
it I'm just watching the back of my hand
so if you can see them but like I want
to try to give you a swatch so you can
see it with one swatch how pigmented is
like you're very very full coverage and
I really really like her range of nudes
I think they're really pretty the first
one is so cute the second one is
literally the third one is like and the
fourth one is Kandy K so the last book
pop that I have this goes down in
history the best liquid lipstick that
I've ever tried in my lifetime I think
which is just crazy but it was honestly
love at first sight i swatched it and I
was like sold and it is the new Smashbox
it's called always on liquid lipstick oh
my god Smashbox just came and just drop
the bomb on the whole world with these
liquid lips they're not sticky they're
not overly dry they don't crumble up and
they don't fall off they're not flaky
they are so beautiful and that's the
thing is like I don't feel like Smashbox
is a brand that I like and die hard for
like Smashbox some things I like some
things I don't but I'm never like oh
and then they came and dropped like 30
colors of the most beautiful liquid
lipstick formula I've ever seen and I'm
just like get a girl or boy whoever it
is get it I have a hair product to
mention really quickly this is for the
girls out there who are looking for
volume this product is a godsend it's by
the brand Bumble and Bumble and it's
called Kretz
a powder and it says right here that it
is equal parts of dry shampoo and a
volumizer and a pinch so literally dry
shampoo and volume all-in-one like yes
please there's nothing else that I need
to life I swear it in my hand rub it
around dump my head put all over my
scalp all over my hair and it's instant
like Vava voom volume I mean not right
now
but when I use it it's so amazing and it
doesn't have a cap of course all my caps
are gone so last but not least is a pair
of sunglasses and I know I mentioned a
pair of designer sunglasses months and
months and months ago in a favorites
video there were a lot of people upset
about the price but honestly I have to
mention these because I took a selfie on
snapchat wearing these and I don't think
I've ever had that many screen shots in
my life and people were just tweeting me
the image asking me about these glasses
so these are by the brand new mu and can
you see the glitter like the entire
inner rim is this Goldy rond glitter and
it says ombre a scarf it's like a
greenish Brown that goes down to a gold
in the side is this thick oh it's so
dope like I'm so obsessed with these
sunglasses I love oversized sunglasses
so much I don't think these are so cool
anything that sparkles and shines
anything with glitter I I love and I'm
such a fashion collector I can't say I'm
just a sunglass collector because it
doesn't have sunglasses if it's handbags
if it's shoes like I just love fashion
so much all right you guys that's it the
Sun is officially down literally it just
completely left right now at this moment
as you can see I'm with much darker now
my battery is dying so it's time for me
to leave thanks so much for watching
this video I love you guys make sure to
leave your favorites and the comment
section down below and I'll see you
