you're so tiny
are you excited are you excited oh hey
guys
so today I'm going to be doing my August
favorites video I know that I'm a little
bit late but I figured better late than
never and I know a lot of you guys
really like these videos and there's
some of my favorite videos to watch so
let's get into it I'm going to first
mention something that I did mention in
my last video but that's because I just
love them so much and that is the Urban
Decay ellipsis
these came out like a month and a half
to two months ago tops two months ago I
love everything about them from the
packaging to the formula to the colors
to the longevity they are just my
favorite lipsticks worldwide right now I
love them so much I own three shades I
own naked 2 which is what I'm wearing on
my lips right now it's just a really
pretty nude it's more of a round nude
and have a pinky nude and then anarchy
and native which I showed both in my
last favorites video and I will link
that below I love them they feel like
lip balm when you put them on there so
moisturizing they're so opaque so creamy
I just have nothing bad to say about
them at all
I'm also on top of that wearing a buxom
lip gloss which is another favorite of
mine and this is called White Russian
I mentioned a bucks on the blocks I
think in a haul like a month or so ago
and I have two of them now I think two
or three I just love them I think I
don't know if they're actually like
marketed as lip plumping products but I
definitely feel like they are they have
a super tingly feeling very menthol and
it smells like spearmint vanilla that
makes sense and if you don't like that
menthol like intense tingly feeling
you're not going to like these with
glosses I absolutely love them though
this one right here has a very pretty
Beijing pink color just a nice neutral
it has no shimmer and no sparkle I know
that I mentioned another one that I had
which is Samantha and that one had a
gold shimmer in it this has an ocean or
whatsoever and I really really like this
one
next I have the new hourglass nude crown
I'm calling it a crayon
what else to call it but then it will
say a crayon that's what I describe
these as it has a bottom that you twist
up and down right here
this isn't shade number one I think it
goes up to number five or six and you
can see this is just the palest of the
news right there it's a nice peachy nude
I think it is so pretty I love how
opaque it is it's not too sheer I really
don't like sheer nude lip glosses or lip
pencils or lipsticks or anything that's
nude because I do have a lot of pigment
in my lip color and I don't like it to
shine through the nude shade that I put
on so I really like it when they're nice
and opaque like the ones that I have
mentioned I absolutely love this and I
love that they have number one two three
four and I think five and six so that
any shade that you are and you can find
the new boots right for your skin tone I
think it's great next I'm going to talk
about a brush this is from Sigma this is
the tapered kabuki brush this is the
f-86 if you watch my channel you know
that I am obsessed with Sigma kabuki
brushes the f80 is like my holy grail
foundation brush I have not used a
different foundation brush in over a
year and this right here is absolutely
amazing for concealer I love it so so
much it's so quick so easy to maneuver I
have not used my Beauty Blender once
since I started using this about a month
ago so basically I just put on my
concealer i dot it wherever I'm going to
need it and then I just go ahead and
blend this out I love because it is so
big so you're not using a tiny little
concealer brush so you're guaranteed not
to get too much concealer and it's going
to really blend it out so it doesn't
settle in any fine lines so I absolutely
love this and as always I will have a
link to Sigma in my description bar
below with a discount code for you I
have been able een fit me concealer I
did not know that this was called fit me
concealer you guys are the ones that
told me so I'm assuming you're right
you guys aren't usually always right and
this one isn't shade one light I love
this so much I've owned it for a while I
haven't used it recently
I've just been so busy that I wasn't any
time to do a full face of makeup a lot
and I was using this concealer and set
at a full coverage concealer because
moving so quickly and I just love it
it's a medium coverage for sure maybe on
the shear side but I would say more
medium to buildable it's got such a nice
moisturizing factor in it and it's like
kind of moosie in a way it's hard to
explain it's beautiful it doesn't crease
it's moisturizing looks pretty covers I
mean what more can you ask for and it's
Maybelline if I didn't know it was
Maybelline I would think it was a
high-end concealer it's really really
great
after that I'm super excited about this
product this is the hourglass ambient
lighting powder and the shade diffused
light I'm really excited about this
because I have finally found a dupe for
the Mac Pro highlighting powder and
emphasize which is the super stark white
powder that I use to always set my under
eye concealer when I've had so many of
you guys asked me if I know any dupes
for it and I haven't but this right here
I finally found it it is so amazing it's
pretty much taken that one out of my
routine as of right now the shade is
diffuse light and it's like the baiji
olive tone when it looks kind of green
when it's next to other powders but it's
not green on its very sheer and it has a
sheen to it so it's this is a lot that I
put on but it has a really pretty sheen
but it's not shimmery or sparkly it just
has gorgeous gorgeous glow so pretty so
I just use a tiny bit of it and I skin
on a brush I use one of these taper
brushes again by Sigma this is the f-35
I get on there and I just lightly put it
underneath the eye it is so pretty I
love how it sets everything it looks
natural it's much more natural than the
Mac Pro have any powder to emphasize so
I'm really excited about this product
and then they all course have I think
four different shades for different skin
tones this is totally and completely
random this is the bare minerals
original foundation this is in shade
light and it says w15 it next to it I
don't know what that means I'm sure it
has some sort of meaning though but I
know nothing about their minerals so
basically the reason I'm using this is
because I am very dry so I don't like to
use a powder all over my face but at the
same time even
girls need to set some areas of
foundation because it is going to move
especially if you're making tons of
facial expressions like I always am
you're going to get it creasing you're
going to get the because of the weather
it's going to move around so I always
have to set my t-zone area but because I
am so dry what will happen is I'll start
to look choppy and cake face and just
overdone because my skin is not like
powder because I am so dry so this right
here has a beautiful luminosity to it
and because of the luminosity in the
powder it still makes me look hydrated
and glowy along with setting my t-zone I
have been on the hunt for a powder that
would do this for me and it's like I
finally found it in bare minerals I
think it's so funny like it's been under
my nose so it is very full coverage I
would say I mean if I haven't tried it
but if I would use this without a
foundation I'm sure it would cover up
everything but I use it very lightly and
very sparingly just so that my
foundation will move I can't get words
out today I'm really sorry you guys okay
next this is a big deal for me because I
like so picky about my bronzers but this
right here is the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil
this isn't shade medium deep in the same
matte bronzer so if you guys don't know
about this bronzer it straight smells
like chocolate it smells better than
chocolate and it tastes like chocolate
don't ask me how I know that I just do
so there is one wetter than this called
milk chocolate and I tried it like a
year ago and I did not like it it made
me look muddy it didn't work and I was
just like oh no not good but then I saw
they had a darker one and I was like
that might work and I bought it and I
brought it home and I absolutely loved
it
I've been using this for contouring more
than anything it's just gorgeous and
every time I use it I get to smell it
which is the most exciting thing ever
okay I have not heard one thing about
this product yet here on YouTube and I
am so happy about it like I can't
contain my excitement of course I'm
going to talk about josie maran at least
once in every favorites video right I
have two so this is the Josie Maran
Argan illuminating powder this thing
highlighter I'm wearing this all over my
face right now I'm
wearing on my cheekbones my nose my chin
wherever you see highlight I know that I
do look a little oily right now at least
where I'm seeing less oily which
actually gets me a little excited I know
that's weird but I'm so dry that one of
the oily I get really excited okay
anyways so this is a beautiful highlight
shade I actually love it it's such a
neutral shade it's not not yellow or
silver it's right in between I don't
know if you can see that I'm really
hoping that you can you can see it on my
cheekbone so that's what's important it
is so pretty it is like smooth as butter
it literally feels like butter I wish I
could let you guys feel it it drives me
crazy that I can't let you guys touch
and smell things and I'm showing you but
it is so gorgeous I have not seen it in
any Sephora I just took a chance and
bought it online if you want to trust me
you should take the chance to because
it's gorgeous
another highlighter that I have been
loving is this Stila all-over shimmer
duo Stila all-over shimmer duo in kitten
so this right here you get two little
highlighters you get a little pink side
and a little baby gold side I've been
using me in the pink side I am NOT tan
enough to use as a highlighter I can use
this over top of my blush for an extra
glow but this is definitely the actual
highlighter it is so pretty these two
highlighters right now I go back and
forth back and forth I love them so much
it's so gorgeous and this is a great
Universal product because if you're
super fair you can use this one and if
you're super dark you can use this one
so like it's not going to feel anyone I
have to give a quick shout out when it's
dessert it's dessert and makeup geeks
new fall pigments on absolutely
amazeballs I cannot get over it they're
the most pigmented pigments I've ever
used
haha so cute seriously though I cannot
get over it I did post an Instagram
photo of these and I also made a blog
post about them because I love them so
much I am just so impressed the colors
are gorgeous she has a purple a copper
of green a burgundy and then just this
gorgeous color that I'm going to leave
on mentioned because I'm going to be
doing a tutorial on it very soon I'll
show you this green one right here this
is called kryptonite and it's like one
of my face and I wish I have brown eyes
because it looks so nice so that is
literally barely touching the product
I'm not joking I barely touched it and
it's so pigmented it is absolutely
gorgeous the Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray it's a big deal that I
mention this again I think this might be
my third favorite video that I'm
mentioning this I went to my mom's house
for a week this month and I forgot to
bring this with me
and my makeup never looked right like
every day when I would apply my makeup
it just did not look the same is there
was something missing and it was because
I did not bring this with me I
completely forgot about it when this is
gone which is going to be very soon it's
very low I will be going out and
repurchasing it which is a big deal for
me because I have so much makeup
I usually don't run out and repurchase
the same thing immediately because I
feel like I will have something
comfortable not this one I will go out
and get this one immediately it says
that this is for dryer or combination
skin that it has a thermal control
technology so makeup stays looking just
applied longer better you get it so I
absolutely love this so much juice
Beauty green apple firming body
moisturizer this is the most amazing
body moisturizer I actually loved it
when I heard green apple I thought oh
I'm not going to like it because I'm
usually not crazy about green apple but
it does not smell like green apple to me
or anyone else said how to try it it's
just the perfect body lotion it's not
too thick and it's not watery it's that
lotion that you can rub on all over your
body and get in your bed five minutes
later and the sheets won't stick to you
if you know what I mean I hate that
feeling it's super moisturizing and it
leaves you moisturize for a long time
and I got this at Ulta you can find
Juice Beauty normally at every Ulta so
that's pretty easy and then last but not
least I have to get a little shout out
to my Chanel chance this has been my
baby for the last month I have been
spraying it every single day I love it
so much it smells very spring and very
summer
it smells like Marc Jacobs Daisy but on
steroids and
it's it's so fresh and even though we're
going into the fall I don't care I'm
gonna do me all year round and this
perfume is so me so it's a lot like
dolce gabbana light blue and Marc Jacobs
Daisy like feels very fresh not florally
but just clean scents oh I love it so
much I could seriously sit and just
smell perfume all day I love smells so
much ok so that completes my favourites
