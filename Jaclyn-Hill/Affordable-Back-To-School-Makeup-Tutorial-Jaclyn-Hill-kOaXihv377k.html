be doing a back to school makeup
tutorial for you hi not just any back to
school makeup tutorial like my past ones
but this is going to be a mostly
drugstore and all affordable makeup
tutorial again the reason I'm calling it
mostly drugstore but all affordable is
for obvious reasons not every single
thing that I use can be found at your
local drugstore but everything that I do
use can be purchased online or other
places and is all very affordable but I
will say like nineteen ninety-four five
percent of what I use in this video is
at your local drugstore I think there's
just like two products that aren't
technically truck star but the one thing
that I did cheat on I was going to go
ahead and call myself out right now is
the anasazi eyebrow definer I'm sorry
I'm sorry I'm not gonna try to sit here
and make it for you guys I have tried I
feel like everything from the drugstore
when it comes to brows anytime I see
someone say that they like something
from the drugstore that's a brow product
I run out I buy it and it never compares
to a Nastasia brow definer so I wasn't
going to use it just for the purpose of
the video you know like this is how I do
my brows this is what I do it's genuine
I like it however you do your brows
stick to it when it works it works so
for this back to school makeup look I
definitely had older girls in mind like
high school college-age girls because
this is like makeup it's not a no makeup
makeup look like we did full coverage
foundation I wanted to keep it more
realistic though I did include false
lashes or do anything smoky or a harsh
contour very simple very easy to achieve
and if you're exhausted in the morning
and your eyes are barely open you can
still do this with one eye closed so
just saying it's been tested and
approved but I just want to say before
jumping into the video that you do not
need to wear makeup to go to school and
have fun and meet new friends and fit in
and feel beautiful and be beautiful
because honestly like self confidence is
the most beautiful thing that woman can
wear for those of you who enjoy playing
with makeup
and you want to have fun I hope you
enjoy this back to school makeup look
but for those of you who don't want to
wear makeup and you might be sitting
you're watching this video because you
feel like you have to X out of the video
and leave like who cares you do not need
to wear makeup okay I just want to put
that out there for all the young girls
in school right now do not feel like you
have to do anything in order to fit in
you're beautiful the way you are I love
you guys and I hope you enjoy this video
hey guys so first things first I'm going
to be priming my skin you can use any
primer you want just make sure you slap
some on that be so that your makeup
lasts all day long i'm using the l'oreal
lumi light infusing primer it's my
favorite from the drugstore so hydrating
gives you a nice glow then i'm gonna go
in with the L'Oreal Lumi cushion
foundation this is definitely my
favorite foundation from the drugstore
I've tried several of them and this one
just gives such a beautiful glow while
still looking natural it doesn't settle
in my lines it's just my favorite it
gives a really gorgeous kind of satiny
natural finish and I just take my brush
and I push it right into the cushion and
then I just begin applying it all over
my skin then after that I'm going to be
going in with concealer and I'm going to
use the Maybelline master concealer this
is my favorite concealer from the
drugstore this is kind of like my
favorite drugstore tutorial if you will
I'm going to go ahead and put about 45
layers of that concealer on and then I'm
going to blend it out with a damp Beauty
sponge
I can't even stress enough how much a
beauty sponge has changed the makeup
game for me whether it's a beauty
blender or a Real Techniques sponge this
one is by morphe a damp Beauty sponge
applying my concealer and my under eye
powder has changed my life I'm going to
use the RCM a no color translucent
powder with that same exact damp sponge
I'm going to begin just to press that
into my skin if you are dry and you feel
like powders dry you out I would highly
suggest using this one it's the only
translucent powder that doesn't make my
under eye look like a pancake because I
can get really dry and kind of crepe up
really easily
I'm gonna take that same powder and just
slap it all over my entire face with a
huge fat powder brush this is going to
mattify my skin but we'll go in with
some highlight to kind of bring some
life back later then for bronzer I'm
going to be using the Physicians Formula
butter bronzer I swear this stuff smells
like a tropical vacation every time I
open it up I'm just like yes please give
me my opinion colada cabana boy where
are you I'm using a japonesque brush to
a pull
by this bronzer and I'm gonna be honest
it's a little scratchy on my face I was
really excited to try it cause I saw
good reviews but I didn't love the way
it applied my bronzer which is why you
see me going in with a different big fat
denser brush to kind of get it really
smooth and airbrushed how I want it to
be then for blush I'm going to go in
with you wet and wild color icon blush I
don't know the shade of this but I will
put everything brushes products
everything in the description box down
below kathleenlights is the one that
recommended this to me so thank you so
much Kathleen but I have to say my
favorite blush from the drugstore of all
time is still Milani Luminoso I'm going
to take that exact same japonesque brush
and just take a ton of that RCM a
translucent powder I just put on the
lower half of my face to clean
everything up so it's not messy now for
eyes I'm going to be going in with this
new palette that I am super excited to
be trying and this is by juvy as place
it's called the Nubian I believe oh look
at all those 50 warm tones these shadows
remind me a lot of morphe shadows like
the price point is kind of similar
they're affordable palettes and the
pigmentation is very similar to me the
way they blend out so I'm going to start
off with a big fluffy brush and I'm
going to stick strictly it to the outer
corner of the eye the main reason I'm
sticking to the outer corner is because
when you're getting ready early in the
morning and you might feel like you're
looking tired you didn't get good sleep
or a lot of sleep when you put a smoky
eye or you bring shadows all the way
into the inner corner it can kind of
weigh down the eye make it look heavy
therefore create almost more shadows and
make you look even more sleepy so I'm
going to put the dark shades on the very
outer corner and then once there's
basically nothing left on my brush I
will just ever so lightly bring it into
the inner crease just to kind of blend
out but mainly keeping all the dark
colors on the outer edge then I'm going
to take that light kind of white frosty
shade and put that on my lid but I
realized it was a little too pale for me
and I wanted something a little bit
bronze e'er if you're more fair and tone
that color would be beautiful on its own
but I mix this kind of darker golden
shade and you know me when I'm working
with Pallas I like to use as many colors
as possible because I'm just so excited
and such a makeup lover I'm like I want
to use all 30 shades at the same time so
I'm going to pack both those shimmers
and I'm going to put them on the entire
lid from inner corner all the way across
the entire lid up towards the crease
then I'm going to take those exact same
matte Browns and put them on the lower
lash line and again I'm going
be sticking mainly to the outer corner
and then once there's barely anything
left on my brush I will lightly blend it
inward that way we have like a larger
eye appearance to make us look more
awake by sticking to the dark colors on
the outer corner I am now taking the
darkest matte Brown on a pencil brush
and putting that just on the outer edge
of my upper lash line this is kind of
gonna mimic eyeliner just by giving us
more dimension without actually having
to go in and do the work because I
wanted to keep it more simple and bring
dimension without having to try to do an
eye liner or actually get precise
especially when you're trying to get
ready in the morning like girl no one
has time for that I'm going to give my
lashes a quick curl and then I'm going
to go in with L'Oreal voluminous carbon
black mascara not only is this mascara
black as night but it just gives a very
feminine natural-looking lasting chunky
or clumpy which is why it's ideal for a
school day makeup look it's very
feminine now I'm going to be
highlighting and I'm using the sleek
makeup palette and go ahead and one your
classmates now to wear some UV
protection and sunglasses because this
highlight shines so bright it is
guaranteed to blind them i am using the
morphe fan brush to apply this this is
the 310 i'm going to hit the top of my
cheekbones to my nose my chin and
basically just all over the place and
then i'm going to go back with that damp
Beauty sponge and just tap oh my gosh
this tip is a godsend thank you to one
of my subscribers for leaving a comment
telling me to do this it just makes your
highlight look so beautiful and blend in
with the rest of your face and I died
for this tip now for my lips I'm going
to go in with a morphe lip polish lip
paint not quite sure what it's called
this is in the shade I ran some feels
really buddy and buddy buttery and
moisturizing throughout the day kind of
like you're wearing a chapstick but it
just gives a really nice color so that's
that you guys I hope you enjoyed thanks
so much for watching I love you and I'll
see you my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
