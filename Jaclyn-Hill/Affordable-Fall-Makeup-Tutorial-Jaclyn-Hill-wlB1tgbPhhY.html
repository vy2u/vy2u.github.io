sure I'll have any lipstick on the chief
before embarrassing myself in front of
thousands of people moving come on
today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial on the look that I am wearing
right here and I'm super excited for
today's video because this is an all
affordable makeup look which I am very
very excited about the only thing that I
kind of skipped over was the brows I use
the anastacio brow ways but I figured
you guys would forgive me because you
know how it is with the brows it's like
don't mess with the brows I saw recently
a ton of requests on like two videos ago
for an affordable or drugstore makeup
look so I was like let's do it
I also saw a few requests incorporating
cool tones into a smoky eye so we did
that as well which is very outside of my
comfort zone let me just say when I was
going in with the cool tones in my
crease I was like oh my god because I
always work with neutrals or warms all
myself because I just don't love cool
tones on me but I actually do like this
look right now I really like how it
turned out so I am comfortable with this
and I also saw a ton of you guys asking
for me to work with the Jaclyn hill
favorites palette that I designed with
morphe at last December so I thought I
would bring that back for this video so
we're doing cool towels we're doing the
Jack no favorites palette and we are
doing an affordable look in one videos
so I'm trying to meet as many requests
as possible if you don't own this
palette don't worry they sell these
shadows individually for $2 a piece so I
will go ahead and list them down below
for you guys like which ones I am using
so if you do want to purchase these you
can go ahead and purchase the exact same
colors that are in this palette for
yourself online so don't feel like left
out because you don't have this palette
or anything like that you know I'm
saying I also want to say really quickly
that I use any elf blush palette today
for the first time ever a subscriber
recommended this to me so I immediately
went out and bought it a couple of days
ago and you guys have seen me use this
palette which is the morphe 9b palette I
love this palette I don't just love this
palette for its affordability I can't
look at this palette say oh yeah it's
good for the price like no this palette
is just good like these blushes are good
they're pigmented they are blendable
they're soft I love them but I wanted to
try something different today because
I just got these a couple days ago and I
was really excited to try them I will
say they are just as pigmented as the
morphe blushes the only difference is
the morphe ones have a little bit more
blend ability they're a little bit
creamier but other than that they have
the same pigment um so the morphe ones
are a bit easier to work with but still
if you're looking for a great
inexpensive blush palette just to grab
at your local drugstore this elf one was
really good I just want to mention that
before jumping into the video because
this was my first time using this and so
that's like my little baby mini review
on it I hope you guys enjoy this video
and if you do give it a big thumbs up
and please subscribe I love you guys so
much you know I mean it and I'll see you
soon bye alright so first thing we're
going to do today is prime our face I'm
using the Loreal light infusing primer
this is my favorite drugstore primer
because I am very dry so this helps give
me like a radiant glow to the skin and
it makes that foundation glide on just a
little bit easier and today for
foundation I'm going to be mixing the
original Lory true L'Oreal True Match
and the L'Oreal True Match Lumi I'm
using shade w-4 and both foundations the
original one is just a little bit too
dry for me but the Lummi one can be very
luminous so I want to mix it together to
kind of get the best of both worlds so I
am using a morphe M 439 foundation brush
as always to blend this into the skin
and this is a very affordable foundation
brush as well if you're looking for a
good one this one is bomb now I'm going
to be going in with concealer and I am
using the Maybelline master concealer I
really really like this concealer I am
blending it out with a real techniques
sponge which is basically the same thing
as a Beauty Blender but again it's more
affordable and I love this I've been
choosing it over my Beauty Blender for
the past month it's super big one side
has like a flat side and the other side
is like a pointed so you can really get
up in the corner of your eyes and blend
everything out it's so fat and squishy
and I love it now I'm going to go in
with a NYX highlight and contour kit and
I'm going to be using a morphe m43 8
brush to use these two middle shades
together on the under eye area just to
set my concealer I normally use the
anastacio powder and the Mac emphasize
but these do the exact same thing and
they did a great job so I'm just going
to be blending that out on the entire
under eye area and then I will also put
that on
eyelid as well so that my shadows blend
a little bit better now I'm going to be
going in with the morphe Jaclyn hill
favorites palette which is so like
awkward to say that but anyways I am
using this kind of medium tone warmish
neutral Brown that you saw all the way
to the left side the palette I will put
the exact numbers and names down below
for you guys if you don't own this
palette and I am using a sigma e40 to
dust this all over in the crease area I
like to initially go in with a neutral
or a warm shade because if I go in with
just nothing but cool colors it can
sometimes look like I've been punched in
the eye so I always like to start with
kind of a peachy warm or neutral base
and blend everything out and then pack
on the cool shades on top of that so I'm
going to go in with the first cool tone
Brown right here and I'm going to be
using a what is this morphe m43 3 brush
to apply this in my crease area I'm
going to go all the way from the outer
corner to the inner corner and I'm going
to keep this as low as possible because
again I don't want to bring this too
high up because that's when your eye can
start to look a little bruised when
working with cool tones so I keep this
really low in that crease as you can see
I'm really hollowing it out back and
forth and then once there's less product
on the brush I will begin to blend
upward into that warm color to kind of
combine the both of them into a neutral
shade now I'm going to go in with an
even duct cool tone Brown which is the
one right next to the one that we just
picked up and using the exact same brush
I'm going to do the same step right in
the crease of my eye I'm going to go
back and forth and really carve out this
crease area if you do not have a defined
crease that's okay you can create one
and do the same step and fool people
that you have a deep set crease even if
you don't that's the beauty of makeup if
I seem distracted or I'm laughing I'm
looking around I'm talking it's because
my mom is in the room she was on the
phone and she had it on speaker so I
could be a part of the conversation but
I'm like I'm still filming even if
you're going to be behind the camera so
that's why I seem a little distracted at
times anyways once you don't have as
much product on your brush you want to
blend upward that is like the biggest
part and blending out your shadow and
making it really seamless now we're
going to grab the shade right next to
those other two Browns that we've been
using this whole time which is kind of a
neutral kind of cool tone sandhi Brown
that's how I'm describing it and any
synthetic brush will do to pack this on
the lid I'm going to
over a couple of times to really make
that color a little bit brighter if you
want to spray your brush with some fix+
that would be great you want to I
actually tried spritzing my brush with
the L'Oreal makeup setting spray and it
just was not having it at all it was not
it didn't have glycerin in it so it
wasn't really sticking and giving that
metallic look but you could use eye
drops and that would also wet in your
brush and it would give it a little bit
more sticking power if you want your
eyes to really glisten
so now I'm going to go in with L'Oreal
smoldering eyeliner this is a creamy
coal liner and I am going to just put
this all over the lash line as you can
see I'm not really trying to make it
perfect but I want to keep it more on
the thin side and right on the lash line
and then I'll take any sort of small
definer brush and just very lightly kind
of smoke that out I don't want it to be
too smoky though but I just want it to
be a soft liner not too black not too
intense not too smoky but just a little
bit of definition on the lashes so that
we don't leave the lash line completely
blank but yet I didn't want to do like a
dramatic cat eye today now I'm filling
in the brows as always and I am just
using the Anastasia brow Wiz in the
shade taupe I tried the I think it's by
NYX the NYX brow pencil I think or maybe
was NYC and it was just so hard to use I
just stuck with the Anastasia one that
one was just super dry I don't know if I
got like a dud and if they're usually
good but it just wasn't working for me
so I just stuck to what I know so that I
didn't mess up the eyebrows so I go a
lot lighter on the inner corner and then
I go much heavier on the outer tail and
I just blend it all out with the spoolie
now we're gonna go in with lashes and
I'm using House of lashes in the style
siren these are very fluffy and I refers
them as daytime lashes but for some they
are not daytime lashes but they're very
fluffy and very beautiful without being
really over-the-top and dramatic so I am
using the l'oreal voluminous mascara and
carbon black and i'm only putting this
mascara on the very base of the lashes
and the reason I do this is because it
really helps blend the lashes with your
fake ones but at the same time I don't
want to take it up all the way on all
the lashes because it can really kill
the longevity of wearing these lashes
multiple times not to mention it can
make them look noticeably fake so I just
do it at the very root and base of the
lashes now I'm going to mix the two
highlighting shades from this palette
one it has a little bit of a pinky
undertone and the other one has a little
bit of a yellow undertone so I mix them
together to make it a little bit more
neutral and using any synthetic brush
just pop this at the high point of the
brow bone and then blend it down along
the tail of the brow if you want more of
a natural daytime look you can skip this
but you know me I'm always going to add
the drama for you so that you can see
how it looks now using the same L'Oreal
smoldering eyeliner I'm just going to
line my entire waterline because we are
going to smoke this out a little bit and
once I've done that I'm going to go in
with this really super dark brown that
has a little bit of a purple undertone
in it for the lower lash line
any definer brush I'm just going to pack
this really tightly up against that
lower waterline so that the black liner
and this Doc Brown can kind of mix
together and become its own little
special cocktail and then using a pencil
brush I'm going to blend out the whole
lower lash line all the way back and
forth I always suggest putting a light
brown shade on the pencil brush because
it'll really help get that lower lash
line nice and seamlessly blended and
then basic we're going to go in and
apply some mascara to the lower lashes
again I am using the l'oreal voluminous
and carbon black because I like my
lashes black just like my heart I
couldn't resist I'm sorry I'm going to
be bronzing my face and i'm using the
morphe 4 brush to apply the Jane
bronzing powder in a shade inspire love
this brush and love this bronzer these
two together are amazing I think this
bronzer is so great it's so blendable
it's very light so I like that it's not
orange and I like that I actually have
to pack it on to get some color because
you can sometimes go overboard with
bronzer right and you're like whoa why
does it look like I have an orange blob
on my face or it can look muddy but this
one you really have to pack it on to get
the shade to show up which I kind of
appreciate because you won't go
overboard too easily so it's going to
blend that out all around the cheek area
down on the jawbone the forehead the
temples basically everywhere except the
center of the face and then I'm going to
go in with my blush palette and this is
by elf and this is in the shade dark
they have a light one and a dark one and
I'm using the dark one and I'm going to
mix these two shades together one is
like a raspberry and the other one is a
pink you can see how pigmented this is
it is like it's pigmented and I'm using
that exact same efore brush by morphe to
blend this out and I'm really going to
make sure I work at
blending this out because it is really
pigmented they aren't that crazy
blendable but that's okay because
they're so pigmented that I'm like whoa
worth it so now I'm going to mix these
two highlight shades in the NYX
highlight and contour palette and I'm
using the morphe and 501 brush to apply
this and look how pretty does highlight
turned out it's so pretty I mean it's
definitely white it's not like a
champagne color or a gold color but I
just think that it's such a beautiful
highlight shade so I'm going to put a
little bit out on my chin and a tiny bit
of it on the side of my nose and really
blend that out so we can get a nice glow
going on because you know strobing is
all the thing of the soul so I'm now
going to line my lips using the Revlon
Colorstay lip liner in the shade
chocolate which this color doesn't look
like chocolate to me right like it looks
like such a berry fall time shade it
doesn't look like chocolate but that's
okay any lip liner will work because I'm
going to go with a super super dark lip
but I just wanted to line my lips
because this is going to kind of act as
a base to keep the lipstick that we're
going to put on next in place so that
doesn't slide all over our face and now
I'm going to go in with an oldie but a
goodie and this is Revlon black cherry
any of my og subscribers will remember
this from like the first six months that
I was on YouTube so I thought we would
bring it back so after that this look is
complete I hope you guys enjoy this look
thank you so much for watching I love
you and I'll see you soon hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
