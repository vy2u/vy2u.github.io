did you like that way so sorry so today
we are going to be talking all about
contouring I gives the bright lights in
the kiss how on glass look at his little
face
you're gonna ruin my makeup
ah don't give me two sunglass knocks on
my nose my hair on camera my brain is
not working today at all I was so tired
I had so much hair memories this was 15
pounds ago look at my little face my
face is tiny so for today's video I'm
going to be showing you how I style my
hair I get a lot of questions about my
hair and honestly I'm just not I'm not
good at it I'm not good at hair hair
confuses me hair stresses me out it's
not my thing
make up a fashion all about that but
usually this is how I do this Soundwave
zone because once I do my makeup and my
outfit I'm like can I be done this is a
full-time job it's a process I don't
want to do my hair I want to leave I
want to go live my life but I want to
stay in the bathroom for 30 minutes in
style my hair it's gonna end up looking
like crap anyways because my hair is
just so flat naturally it's insane and I
live in Florida and most people in
Florida like when they have humidity
around them like their hair reacts and
gets bigger not mine my hair gets
flatter it took a curse I want to move
to California just so I can get some
volume because when I'm in California I
feel like I'm just like yes yes hair
fair like my hair can finally be like
big and voluminous and not get weighed
down by the human humidity so to get my
hair to literally have any sort of
texture or volume I literally put six
products in my hair when it's damp and
it is the only thing I have found it it
actually gives me body and actually
texture and actually makes my hair
workable so I can curl it and I can
style it I can get some volume in it
because you don't even want to know this
is what my hair looks like after taking
my hair out of a scrunchie I washed it
about close to 48 hours ago and I did
not style it when I got done washing it
and I didn't sell it yesterday except
just been working from home for the past
two days so it's literally been in a
scrunchie for almost 48 hours and this
is what it looks like my hair color is
the most asked question on my channel of
all time so I just started going to this
new girl who's absolutely amazing she's
in North Tampa she's in the Tampa Bay
area if you guys are looking for someone
I will link her Instagram down below
she's incredible she did the biologic
niek on my hair I don't really know any
of these terms mean you guys so there's
any hairdressers out there watching I
know I'm having me for one of myself but
at least I'm honest about it I do not
know we're talking about when it comes
to hair um she did the bylaws technique
so the bottom of my hair look right here
the tips it's much more like a fiery red
and then up here it's much more like a
darker Auburn that kind of like fades
and ombres down which I love especially
when it's styled on its curl that's not
so great now but when it's styled it's
curled I love the way that ends have
like that fiery PC look and in the top
is much darker and Auburn so for those
of you who are trying to achieve a hair
color similar to this which I'm always
getting question about what my formula
is I don't know my formula is especially
now that I'm going to someone new I can
try to find that out next to my build
and post on snapchat for you guys um but
I always always ask for a warm rich dark
deep Auburn shade with only coppers and
reds and no purple or violets because I
wanted to have like that hmm like I
wanted to be warm and I want it to be
deep and I want it to look yummy and
like fudgy almost but I don't want it to
be purple whatsoever or violet
whatsoever which it still happens even
though no one's ever
violet in my hair sometimes my hair
would still pull violet like what don't
worry goes my butter I just wanted to be
I wanted to be like Mac copper ring
that's what I want in my hair as for the
cut of my hair it is a very PC which was
accidental I did not know that it was
going to be this PC I'm kind of a weird
awkward moment with my hair at which I
feel like I say that my whole life I'm
kind of waiting for some pieces to grow
out to really have the cut that I'm
really truly wanting in the front is a
little bit longer than the back and I
want it to be even more drastic I'm
waiting for everything to grow a couple
more months but I definitely want it
shorter in the back the longer at the
front you can see there is definitely an
angle right there it's just not drew as
drastic as I want it to be and I have
tons of PC layers the circle my entire
head and at first I got these I
absolutely hated them now I've
definitely gotten more accustomed and
more friend with my layers and I think
they kind of work for me especially
since I only ever wear my hair curly and
wavy now I don't really ever wear my
hair straight anymore exists I don't
know I feel like I look so political
please we're not we're actually styling
my hair this is the one that I use every
single day I used to use the Bellamy 6
in-1 which is six different ones that
you can just continuously clip on or
take off which is awesome I just feel
like I use this one more because it
works so much faster like I only have to
hold my hair around this for just a
couple of seconds and it's done and
that's why I love so much is because
it's so quick and I'm all about things
being quick mmm that's what she said
okay so the first thing I do is just
flip up a portion of my hair where's my
scrunchie
yes I've literally been wearing
scrunchies recently because like you can
just buy them on Amazon because I've
noticed that when I'm around my house if
I put my hair up in a ponytail and I use
just like a regular hair twisty it puts
a bend in my hair and then when I take
my hair down it's got like that line on
your head
look this scrunchie does not do that
a bend in your hair whatsoever which is
why I'm using it so all I'm going to do
is grab sections of hair I'm going to
grab a pretty generous amount because I
dealt with my hair to be curly I want it
to be more wavy I'm going to curl
everything away from my face when my
hair was longer
I would curl towards my face away from
my face towards my face away from my
face like every other piece just to make
it look super duper messy now that I
have shorter hair I feel like it just
looks best when everything is going away
from my face so each time I move up a
row I go up about an inch and a half and
part my hair off and then again like
I'll grab a section like this big right
here and then when I curl it I don't
leave my wand on it for too long
otherwise it will be really curly I
don't want this look to be curly so I
just leave it on for a couple of seconds
and I'll kind of give it like a little
tug on the end just so that it kind of
lays like that because you can see it's
not like an intense curl if I leave this
one on like a full 10 seconds like it'll
be like up here it'll be like curly sue
and I feel like it makes me look very
like my hair like little girl cutesy and
I want it to look more like messy and
beachy and more sexy so the most
frequently asked question I get about my
hair is how I keep the red from fading I
can't keep the red from fading it's
inevitable it's gonna fade no matter
what the number one thing is that I do
not let it very often and when I say wet
I don't just mean shampoo or condition
like I don't get it wet like I don't go
swimming I don't go jump into a pool and
get my hair wet I did that when I was in
LA I jump into pool and that was a big
mistake even though it was a saltwater
pool my hair faded so bad it looks like
kool-aid when I got out I was like oh
okay I use
conditioner made specifically for red
hair by the brand davon s I will link it
down below for any other Reddy's out
there I washed it twice a week I don't
have naturally really oily hair so it's
not a problem for me I use dry shampoo a
lot there is a product by Bumble and
Bumble that I'm obsessed with it's
called prepped a powder I will link all
of my favorite inner products down below
for you guys to me it is definitely all
about the shampoo and how often I wet my
hair like if I wash my hair like three
times in a week I'll definitely see the
difference my hair will fade each time
and yes every single time I take a
shower it looks like someone is being
killed it's red water every single time
all of my towels are red my pillowcase
has red stains on it everything is red
so one of the things I miss about being
blonde nothing stained so now that I
have that side done I'll just kind of
pull it apart kind of piece it up so
that those hot curls don't settle and
stay too curly moving on up another
question I get asked all the time is how
often I get my hair done I get my hair
done every four weeks and that is not
because of the fading that is because of
my roots my roots grow out and look so
terrible with this hair color because I
have very ashy mousy brown hair it looks
like poop honestly it's just not a good
color at all it's not flattering and
against this red color it just looks
terrible it's like this almost brownish
and gray looking color against it and
it's bad like when I was blond I did not
have to get my roots done that often
well I couldn't afford to get my roots
on that off to where I was blonde but um
I I didn't have to get them done that
often because the brown did it look that
bad growing up on my red
the roots look terrible another question
that I get asked is if my hair is
extremely damaged from all the color and
surprisingly it is not I always say it's
damaged I was like my hair is so damaged
my hair is so fried but anytime I go to
a hairdresser they always feel my hair
and they're like no your hair is in
great condition it's super strong it's
not breaking I'm like white um so I mean
according to hairdressers my hair is not
damaged I feel like it is just because
my hair is so dry um I don't do a lot of
intense masks on my hair because when I
do that oh girl my hair has no life for
like a week and a half another thing
that I have noticed that I do when I
curl to keep my hair flat on the barrel
so I put it like this and then I keep
see how all the hair on my barrel is
flat I try to do that as much as
possible because if you kind of twist
your hair around on the barrel and kind
of like I'm saying like it all twisted
up
then it won't have like this nice kind
of look it'll start to look kind of like
kinky and kind of it'll definitely give
you a way Messier look but I'm not going
to that look so I keep my hair flat on
the barrels I'm curling and when I curl
I always curl all the way through the
eggs like you can see I'm not leaving
the ends out I curled the entire thing
because I used to leave the eggs out and
curl it like this but when I would do
that all I would do is make the ends of
my hair flip up and look even more PC
when I look back at old pictures and
videos on my hair sound like that I'm
like oh no I can't stand it now so it's
just got like a personal preference if
you want your ends to kind of stick out
more um but with this haircut I don't
want them to stick out I want them to
kind of blend in okay so now when it
comes to my front bang I don't curl it
all the way to the root I don't want to
take it all the way up to my scalp
because it'll just give me like such a
lava boom bang and I want it to kind of
just like hang down with the rest of the
group yeah you just you just chill there
you chill with your homies
Oh what is that doing
heck no tech no okay that's that right
so now I'm going to go through
everything with my hands and just pull
and separate because I don't want any of
the curls clinging on to each other this
I'm going to do is I'm going to grab
some orb a dry texturizing spray I'm
obsessed with this stuff I'm going to
spray it throughout all my hair stay on
the roots on the ends in the middle
everywhere
I'm just rough it up
alright I'm gonna grab a comb any comb
like wide tooth comb and I'm going to
grab it and just kind of separate
everything because again I don't want my
hair clinging on to each other like
clinging on to the other curls because
that's what will make it look um not as
voluminous and not a skull because it'll
be like clinging on it just kind of like
hanging together so I'm going to just go
through kind of separate everything so
as you can see the outcome isn't
actually curly it's just very messy and
PC and just texturized but it doesn't
actually have like a curly sue vibe I'll
show you the back what it looks like you
can see it's just really just kind of
playful and the great thing about this
hairstyle is that throughout the day
like if the wind blow is my hair goes
flying over like it doesn't bother me
like it can get as messy as I want it to
and like that's kind of the point it's
just for it to be kind of like laid-back
and messy and tousled and PC so that's
of you guys I hope that you enjoy this
video for all of you who requested it it
was so easy to do
you know how easy it is to achieve this
hairstyle honestly it takes me maybe oh
my god absolute tops would be 20 minutes
from start to end of this entire
hairstyle more like 12 to 15 minutes to
do this entire process I've just got it
down so quick of how to do it it's funny
it's such a short amount of time but
yeah like I never want to do it I feel
like grabbing my ass I'm just like so
lazy when it comes to my hair but yeah I
hope you guys enjoy thank you so much
