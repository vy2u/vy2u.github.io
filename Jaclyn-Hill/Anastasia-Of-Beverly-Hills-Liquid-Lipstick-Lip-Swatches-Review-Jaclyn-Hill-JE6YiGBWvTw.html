review and a lip swatch video of the new
aspasia Beverly Hills liquid lipsticks I
posted a photo of these little lipsticks
soon as I received them in the mail
today's ago and asked you guys if you
would like to see a video and review and
lip swatches and you guys said yeah so
that is exactly what we're going to be
doing today I was lucky enough to
receive these bad boys early which is
why I'm able to do this video for you
guys right now Anastacio and her
daughter Claudia who is also known as
more Vina on instagram if you guys
aren't following her go follow her she
is beautiful and is fabulous and her
little pony hair gives me life they sent
these out to a handful of beauty
bloggers makeup artist and I was one of
them that was lucky at tracing these
early which is why I'm able to do this
video for you guys and I'm so excited
about it because I have been
anticipating the arrival of these liquid
lipsticks for quite some time because
Claudia's told me that they've been
working on for a while and I love what
hard work pays off and I just love when
people finally are able to launch a
product and they've been working so hard
on because but we don't see behind the
scenes is these things take forever so
it's always very exciting when I
products finally launches and not only
do they launch liquid lipsticks they
launched a full range of 19 shades so
it's like the color of the freaking
rainbow up in here that's why I'm
sitting here staring like this because
they're all laid out next to me and I
but this video is in no way sponsored by
anastasi of everything that they did not
pay me one little tiny dollar to film
this video I feel like I have to
displaying that because any time I ever
do like a review on any sort of brand
everyone's always like did someone pay
you to say this and no I can't be bought
so that's what's happening let's move on
there is going to be a xx color that is
launching in two weeks and that is going
to be the shade Bambi I do not have that
right now because it has not launched
yet I don't think anybody has it yet but
it is like a purpley pinky very light
lavender shade you can see on anastacio
Instagram and website I've not had that
one so I have all 19 but not the 20th
which is bandy and will be releasing in
two weeks so these lipsticks liquid
lipsticks do retail for $20 apiece on
Anastasius website and I believe Macy's
calm right now
I went there in the Macy's store but I
think Macy's calm is where they're at
this is what the packaging looks like
right here it's got a silver calf they
tied in some gold right here at the top
and then it has the Anastacio Beverly
Hills right there on the packaging
itself so I think it's very pretty very
feminine so basically what it liquid
lipstick is is a lipstick that comes in
the form of a liquid lip gloss looks
like a lip gloss comes out of the same
applicator as a lip gloss as you're
applying it it's going to be extremely
high full coverage and then within about
30 or 60 seconds it's going to dry to a
complete and total matte shade on the
lips very very long wearing very
pigmented very high coverage at one
swipe in your leg Oh lower there are a
few different ways to wear liquid
lipsticks and I will tell you my
personal favorite waist my number one
favorite way to wear that with lipstick
is to line my entire mouth with a lip
liner first kind of as my base I'll line
my lips and it'll completely fill it in
and then I'll go over top of it with a
liquid lipstick the reason I love this
so much is because liquid lipsticks can
be kind of drying because they are so
matte so long wearing they really like
grab on to your lips so I like to put a
lip liner all over my mouth first as a
base and then put this over top because
you're getting like double the power
double the longevity and I just feel
like it looks the best and it lasts for
ever another way I like to wear liquid
lipstick is I will put a little bit of a
lip gloss over top of my lips liquid
lipstick because of the fact they are so
dry and so mad I will put a little bit
of lip gloss because I get the longevity
of the liquid lipstick but I get the
moisture of the lip gloss so it's just
like when to be coming on throwback
Spice Girls yes okay so let's get into
the lip swatch portion of this video
because I do have 19 different colors to
swatch and this might take a look at the
time and I have my olive oil right next
to me ready to go
I'm telling you olive oil is the best
makeup remover ever especially for long
wearing lipsticks my mom has been using
this trick forever and it seriously
works wonders there is no makeup remover
ever that you can buy that is going to
take off a long wearing matte lipstick
or any makeup product for that matter
like this will you just take it
rubble
on your lips grab a paper towel or
cotton pad and what gone like it is
thebomb.com
so that is what I will be using in
between each lipstick to remove these
lipsticks to go on to the next one my
lips might be a little bit of pain but I
can power through the first color we
have is the shade milkshake which is a
very very pale pastel light pink so so
girly I love this color not everyone is
getting comfortable with it but for
those of you who are it's going to get a
very youthful playful vibe I absolutely
love these colors on light blonde hair I
don't know why but I think it just looks
so feminine and so pretty next shade is
pure Hollywood which is honestly just
the perfect color of nude I'm sure this
is going to be a very high seller for
them because it is such a great nude
shade and depending on what lip liner
and what gloss you use with it you can
really manipulate this color to match
your skin tone perfectly this is the
shade lovely which is just a beautiful
mid-tone kind of rosy pink this whole
look beautiful on so many different skin
tones because it's not too cool or too
warm in the shade of pink it's not too
bright or too light so this is lovely
literally it's lovely I get it now we
have the shade baby pink to me this is
like baby pink with a touch of
highlighter and it you know because like
baby pink but like with a little bit of
neon I really love this shade it is very
Barbie to me which is very fun very
girly this next shade is called retro
coral which is exactly what it is called
this is such a fun bright coral this is
idealistic for the summertime like
especially what you got that little
summer glow going on this will just be
absolutely beautiful it screams summer
to me so retro coral this is sweet
talker and this is honestly the perfect
bright hot pink it is so girly
it is so Barbie it's not too warm or too
cool is just that perfect hot pink works
for everybody this is the shade neon
coral which as you can see it has much
more orange in it than the retro coral
did this is a tricky shade but it can be
so absolutely beautiful you don't see it
very often because the fact that it is
very orange on the lips but I would
really recommend this to the
you have naturally a yellow undertones
on your skin or those of you who have a
little bit of a tan also the natural
redheads out there who are more light
and skin it with some freckles and that
light orangie red hair this will look
gorgeous on you especially in the
summertime it'll be something so
different and so fun
this is called party pink and when I
said before that one of these colors
reminded me of Barbie pink no this is
Barbie pink this is so fun so shocking
such an awesome pop of color so
over-the-top just so Barbie this is
definitely party pink this is the shade
of vintage and so far this is my
absolute favorite I love this it's such
a deep berry purple it's so beautiful
and it's a great way to do a very bold
lip but still have an edgy vibe because
sometimes you can do these hot pinks
these hot corals and if you want more of
an edgy vibe that's going to give you
more of a girly glam vibe where this
will still allow you to keep that kind
of darker edgy vibe while still making
such a fun girly statement if you know
what I'm saying so this is the shade of
vintage this is the color Karina which
is a very warm bright statement pink
this reminds me a lot of matte cosmetics
and passion lipstick I haven't held them
right next to each other really like
compare how similar they are but just
put it on the lips it's a very similar
shade which is a very popular warm hot
pink absolutely love this if you're too
scared to do those really cool toned
Barbie Pink's Karina will be the one for
you so here we have electric coral and I
love to be a retro coral neon coral and
now electric coral this I would
definitely describe is a orangie red
that is electric it looks like it's on
fire it is so different and so
absolutely beautiful
I love this color so very orange --red
very electric this is the shade person
mod I don't know if it's persimmon or
pur Simon persimmon think it's persimmon
but it's all good whatever it is it is a
very bright bright orange shade it is a
very true to orange it's kind of a rusty
orange was like a tint of red in it but
mainly it's just like a pure bright
orange this is the shade spicy which is
crazy because as I was applying it
before I even looked at it
like this remind me the hot pepper and
then when I looked at I was like spicy
so I don't know that's a coincidence or
not this is a little bit different than
the color that we just saw before
because it's a little bit darker and has
a little bit more red in it they are
very similar I personally think that
this one is just a little bit more
wearable I would totally wear this color
and especially you're going to line your
lips with a red lip liner first it won't
make it look as orange and you can kind
of go back and forth and use it with and
without a lip liner depending how you
want to wear it so this is a shade spicy
this is the shade beloved line and again
this is a warm undertone of kind of
going like all in a row the colors that
are similar to one another so this is a
very deep red with a hint of orange in
it it is just absolutely beautiful some
people prefer that retro cool tone lip
and some people prefer that more warm
lip and for those of you who like a
warmer orange your undertone this will
be the red for you I absolutely love the
shade this is a shade American doll and
this is like the perfect more cool tone
retro matte red which I absolutely love
it they named American doll since it's
such a retro red I think it's just
adorable so this is a very very classic
red for you this is the shade vamp and
as I was applying it I was like I have
no idea how I could even explain the
color of this because it's just so
different I've never ever worn a color
like this in my life and at first I
thought it's brown and then I was like
no because it has some plum undertones I
really don't know how to explain this
but it very much reminds me of that
famous lip color that Kylie Jenner is
wearing right now but just a few shades
darker this I thought I was going to
hate when I first start putting it on
but now that it's fully on I really
actually like it a lot but I never would
have picked this out for myself so I
really do like this color and I would
recommend this for those of you who have
a little bit of color and your skin or
even if you are very dark in skin tone
you can wear this as a neutral lip and
it would be gorgeous this is the shade
Heather's and oh my gosh I would love
love this color first of all Heather's
is a very classic movie from the 90s if
you haven't seen it it's awesome I love
this color so much this is so vampy and
just dark and different too I do not
even feel like I own a color that is
extreme
similar to this absolutely love the
shade it kind of reminds me of my hair
color honestly just a little bit more
cherry in it oh it's beautiful so this
is Heather's this is the coolest color
oh my gosh I love this Wow this is the
shade sad girl and oh my gosh this is
gorgeous I did not think I was in like
this
because it has glitter and it has a
little reflex of pink throughout it when
I put it on I was like what I do not
like glitter lipstick at all but this is
so cool because a matte liquid lipstick
but yet it has reflex a pink in it it is
so different I don't own anything like
this I've never seen anything like this
and it's just beautiful so different
they did this right this is awesome
what is this this is sad girl last but
most certainly not least we have the
color potion which needs no introduction
whatsoever this color is phenomenal but
it is definitely not going to be a color
that everybody in their mama is going to
be running out to buy this is a very
very intense dark shade it could almost
look like it's black from a distance but
it is a dark dark purple and it has like
a hint of royal blue in it which just
makes it so different so unique just
absolutely gorgeous I love this color so
much it is ideal for like a photo shoot
or just doing something super fun super
intense it's so edgy love love love this
color alright so that completes this
video honestly you guys oh my god my
lips hurt so bad
even though that may not have seemed
like a long time to you it took me an
hour and 30 minutes to do those lip
swatches because it was just like wax
Alexa excellent wexel this is my first
ever lip swatching video and I went into
it with a bang with 19 different lip
swatches so that was in 10th but I hope
you guys appreciated it because I
personally like lip swatches so much
better than swatching on the back of the
hand or the arm because you just get so
much more of a feel for the way they
apply the way they look on the lips the
way they look with the skin and all that
jazz so I hope you enjoyed it also to
let you know that every single lip
swatch that I showed you I only did one
application
so I would pull it out of the tube I
would just go over my lips like this one
time and then put it back in
I never double dipped and like went back
and back and back so you can truly see
how pigmented they were so the colors
you saw on me or one layer if you did
two layers and went back into your tube
they would get brighter they would get
darker they would get more intense also
keep in mind that any of these colors
will be able to be manipulated and
changed up according to the lip liner
that you put our means of it or the
gloss that you put on top of it so I
hope that you guys enjoy also yes since
I was doomed into my lips I'm sure you
guys are going to notice I used to have
my lip pierced
I had to pierce for 60 years that is why
I have a hole there one time when I was
working in Mac so we're gonna walked up
to me and was like oh you have something
and she was like trying like like get
off my face and I was like what and it
was just my scar wasn't even the actual
lip ring and she was like oh I'm sorry
it's a hole in your face I was like oh
my god so yes I have my lip pierced for
six years back in my scene days I was so
emo and so hardcore so that is what that
scar was from but I do need your help
with something right before you go for
those of you that are still sticking
around can you please comment down below
and let me know which video you would
like to see next
I'm debating back and forth I have a
makeup tutorial in mind I am so excited
