look that I'm wearing right here as
always it is going to be a makeup
tutorial this is the most hot mess intro
I've ever filmed in my life get together
today I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial for you and I am about to say I
am super excited for love like I say the
beginning of every single intro but I am
super excited for this more so than
normal because today's makeup tutorial
is based all around kathleenlights
collaborate okay that is not dim
together top wing lights collaboration
with colour-pop cosmetics if you don't
know who kathleenlights is i will link
her channel down below in the
description box go check her out you're
gonna fall in love with her immediately
she's so genuine she's just so sweet and
she's absolutely adorable she has the
most beautiful big green captivating
eyes Wow let's be honest and move on so
kathleenlights did send these to me and
the second I opened up that package I
was like you bet your sweet booty that I
am doing a tutorial based off of her
collaboration with color pop because
Kathleen has done nothing but support me
here on YouTube and just be kind to me
and support my channel and my artistry
and she is just such a sweet girl so she
deserves that right back so go follow
her tell her that I sent you give her a
big cyber hug and a big congratulations
cuz she really does deserve it this is
just awesome so I'm so happy for you
Kathleen I'm so proud of you I actually
not intentionally use a lot of color pot
products like I use color pop highlight
and lips and eyes so it's kind of weird
that happen I just realized that but
anyway I absolutely love this look like
I'll be honest there's some makeup
tutorials that I do that aren't
necessarily a look that I will wear off
of camera because it's so requested I
know you guys want to see it so I'll do
it for you but this look is something
that I will personally wear again for
sure I love this look and especially
because I put a creamy white eyeliner on
the waterline it kind of made it a
little bit different a little bit more
daytime appropriate if you want to dark
it up and make it more sexy I hate using
that word on camera
I'm just so uncomfortable with like if
you want to make this sexual but if you
want to make this more nighttime
appropriate and smokey just do a black
color on your waterline and this make it
much deeper and more intense so I know
that you guys enjoy this
toriel thank you so much for watching I
love you guys go follow Kathleen and
I'll see you soon bye first thing I'm
going to do is prime my face i'm using
makeup forever a radiance primer using
clean fingers of course because we do
not want to spread any bacteria or germs
i'm going to massage this all over my
entire face then i'm going to take the
same makeup forever line using the
smoothing primer i'm going to take this
and just rub it in my t-zone i know this
seems excessive to use two primers but
i've just been loving the way it makes
my skin look recently then for extra
hydration because i am dry i'm going to
spread some mac's
mac fix+ all over my face and i'm going
to go in with my foundation i've been
loving the Dior nude air serum
foundation recently I've raved about a
couple of times it's just my absolute
favorite at the moment it's a sheer to
medium coverage it just looks so natural
it blends beautifully and I am using the
Sigma f80 flat top kabuki to just
massage that and blend it all over my
entire face then we are going to go in
with Urban Decay Naked concealer I'm
going to put this in the entire under
eye area and a triangle shape kind of
down the side of my nose and up towards
my temple and then I'll also put on my
eyelid and I will blend that out with a
damp Beauty Blender the reason I put it
on my eyelid is because it will help me
prime for eyeshadow I don't usually use
an actual eyeshadow primer this is my
way of priming and color correcting at
the same time then I'm going to take
that same highlighter I'm going to put
on the top to the cheeks the chin the
Cupid's bow the center of the nose and
make a little flower in the center of my
forehead as well just to kind of even
out that very subtle highlight it's not
that light but it's kind of then I'm
going to set the under-eye area with
some powder and move forward I'm going
in it with makeup geek Peach Smoothie
eye shadow as my first shade I am using
a sigma e40 eye shadow brush to blend
this out this is just an absolute musts
color for me it just works so great with
my skin tone and it works for a
transition shade to make all the colors
that I use blend seamlessly it just
works for my skin tone it might not work
for everyone but I honestly can't live
without it now I'm going to go in with
ardency in eyeliner and this is in the
shade black what I'm going to do here is
I'm just going to smudge this all along
my lash line just very messily not doing
anything in particular then with any
brush this is a morphe brush but I don't
know the number I'm sorry but I'm going
to just blend this out back and forth
and you do not have to
make it a seamless blending application
just blending it upward this is just
going to help give our lashline depth
when we go in with more shades now I'm
going to go in with the first shade
which is called Cornelius I'm going to
go in with an e25 brush from Sigma and
just put that in the entire crease area
going back and forth and windshield
wiper motions all the way to the inner
corner all the way to the outer corner
back and forth I want this to be just as
dark in the inner corner as I do in the
outer corner because I really want this
to be very around it and very smoky now
I'm going to go in with my favorite
color which is blaze I'm using my finger
to apply this because honestly it's just
what's going to work best so why not use
the best tools that God gave you so
using my middle finger I'm going to rub
that in the eyeshadow and Pat it all
over my entire lid once I have packed a
good amount of that on I'm going to go
back in with the e25 brush from Sigma
and blend out because if you just use
your finger it's going to be kind of
hard not to have harsh lines so I'm
going to go in just to make sure that's
completely blended and then I will pack
even a little bit more on the center of
my lid because I want it to be really
intense in the very center of my lid
then going in with the shade
kathleenlights I'm going to pack this on
the center of the lid as well and i'm
using a mac 242 brush I don't know why I
even picked up the brush it's not
necessary just use your fingers for this
part as well because I go back in with
my finger as you can see and i kind of
blend that together i just wanted an
extra pop right in the center of that
lid i'm going to fill in my eyebrows
with Anastacio brow wiz in the shade
taupe but I'm going to skip right
through that because you see me filling
my brows and it's just not fun to watch
so now I'm going to take the exact same
colors that I use on the upper lid and
I'm going to put them on the lower lash
line literally the same thing in the
same order I'm going to put them on the
lower lash line I'm taking the e25 from
Sigma and I'm going to meet that outer
corner and very softly kind of smoke it
out so it gives a very subtle kind of
cat eye appearance with that light
medium brown shade as you can see it's
very subtle but it kind of brings the
eyes outward and upward then I'm going
in with an e 15 from Sigma and I'm going
to go back in with a shade blaze and
just coat the whole lower lash line then
grabbing a pencil brush I'm going to go
in with kathleenlights for just a really
beautiful glow on top all three shades
that are on the top we're gonna put on
the lower lash line and then we are
going to separate them by going in with
a very
creamy kind of ivory white pencil this
is a MacPro pencil so I will link it
down below for you guys in the
description bar if you're having a hard
time finding it I'll make it easier for
you this is my favorite white pencil
ever because it's not too white it's got
a very kind of fleshy creamy vibe to it
and it just gives a very different look
when you're working with a smoky eye and
makes it much more daytime appropriate
then you can exchange it for a black
eyeliner at night and make it more
nighttime appropriate I'm going to be
going in with lashes and today I'm using
a brand called mink wink lashes in the
style Tribeca I love these because
they're fluffy and they're girly but yet
they also have like kind of a spiked
eNOS to them and they give a lot of
definition to the eyes so they're
absolutely beautiful now I'm going to go
in and cut my lower lashes with mascara
whatever mascara will do my favorite
lower lash mascara as always is mac
gigablack lash there's something about
the wand it's just so small and precise
it's just my favorite for lower lashes
now I'm going to go in and bronze my
face
well it started off with the idea of
bronzing and then it kind of turned into
contour whoops sorry story of my life
I am using the Wayne Goss brush number
13 which is a beautiful brush for
bronzer application and I am using hoola
bronzer by benefit to do this I'm going
to just give my cheeks definition and
I'm also going to sculpt the forehead as
well and I will just blend until my arms
hurt and my hands feel like they're
going to fall off and then I'm going to
go in with a lighter shade I'm using the
Anastasia banana powder I believe using
the Kat Von D brush that came out with
her shade light palette I'm just going
to do this because this helps give just
the face a more sculpted look because
like I said at first I wasn't playing on
contouring but then I was like I changed
my mind
I want to contour so here we go we're
doing it so I'm going to contour
underneath I mean I'm sorry highlight
underneath the eyes and on the forehead
as well to even everything out then
going in with Becca songbird blush this
blush is my current obsession I am so in
love with it it is so absolutely
ridiculously beautiful as you can see
right here on camera it is just the most
gorgeous swarmy pinky amazingness that
ever happened to my cheeks now I'm going
to go in with the new color pop
highlighter and this is in the shade
smoke and whistles such a gorgeous shade
so I do recommend recommend using this
with your finger you can use a brush as
you see me doing right here but I'm
going back and forth between two morphe
brushes applying this but honestly if
you just use your finger
it'll work absolutely beautifully
because I ended up just using my finger
to do my chin and my Cupid's bow because
it's kind of a smooth kind of squishy
moosie watery based highlight so it is
what it is use your finger you'll be
good then I went in with the same
Cornelius eyeshadow and just put a
little bit underneath my lower lip just
to give kind of a fuller powder your
lower lip going on I'm going to use
colour-pop lippie stick in the shade
bound which is my favorite nude pink
ever buy them and then I'm going to
finish off this look with urban decay
gel makeup setting spray and your look
is complete so I hope this you guys
enjoy this video thanks so much for

soon
