my April favorites I actually was not
planning on doing a favorites video this
month just because I feel like time goes
by so fast in favourites video come
every four weeks and I just feel like
it's a lot sometimes like maybe it's too
many favorites is there ever such thing
I don't know so I was planning on not
doing it but then I was like you know
what I'm a substantial amount of product
so I'm gonna talk about my favorites and
it's not too late cuz it's the fifth of
May happy Cinco de Mayo by the way hey
even though this is literally what I'm
doing today um I'm completely I'm home
alone all day long John is at band
practice and so I am here by myself I
will be editing and playing with my dog
and clean the house so happy single day
my home so I have a lot of bronzers and
highlighters to talk about this month
which is probably just because the fact
that so many cosmetic brands are coming
out with bronzers and highlighters right
now it's that time of year I'm taking
out these bracelets coz I can already
tell they're gonna annoy the hell out of
me now we have a clean free wrist I
can't stand it when it's like
clink-clink-clink you're like shut it
down the first product that I have been
loving is a bronzer by Makeup Forever
and they came out with a whole new set
of bronzers and I think there's six of
them I'm pretty sure and they're on all
different colors some are more cool and
tone some are more neutrals some are
more warm there are all different shades
for all different skin tones whatever
you may need but I have been loving them
so you can see the way they're packaged
they have this nice swirl in them and
the way they come off is not like a
normal power they come off with a very
beautiful Sheen to them now it's not
glittery it's just this nice sheen that
looks so natural I am wearing this one
all over right now I use a big powder
brush you'll actually see because I
filmed this look like could get ready
with me earlier this morning but I am
wearing this like all over my cheek area
and my temples and I swooped it across
my face in my chin so this is what I
have right here I'm still confused about
the numbers and the names of them makeup
forever can always be super tricky great
I just dug my nail in that fabulous
that's God's punishment to me for not
getting a fill I think this is named
three five one I'm not quite sure
because it's so tiny on the back you can
barely see it but I think it's 35
and I will link it down below I'm not
100% positive if these have launched yet
because they did send out a press
package to everyone on their list and
this was a part of it so they didn't
have any part in there anything saying a
date that it launched but I have been
loving loving this bronzer it's just
such a different unique consistency and
it just looks so natural on the skin
it's not powdery it's not ashy and it's
not muddy it's just very fine and very
sheer and just looks so natural it has a
nice glow beautiful bronzer right makeup
forever next we have another bronzer and
this one is very unique this one is by
hourglass and this is the ambient
lighting powder and luminous bronze
light so my sister is actually the one
that turned me on to this product
because she talked she talked about it
on her blog look for someone who is more
around my color to fair or extremely
fair this is going to be a bronzer on
you and the way I apply it the same way
that my sister does which is with a huge
powder brush and will just take it and
spin it in here and then just go all
over the cheeks and it's just so pretty
and I was very nervous that the shimmer
and this would make me look muddy
putting it all over but it doesn't
somehow it just works it's beautiful it
catches the light it looks very natural
it just looks very glowy very Jennifer
Lopez that's all I'm really asking for
in life is just Jennifer Lopez and I
feel like this is just so Jennifer Lopez
I'm not obsessed at all so I have owned
this for like three months
and I've never talked about it because I
didn't even use it for the first month
that I owned it like I get new product
and I'll like put it on my vanity and
I'm like it's so pretty but I won't
actually touch it I'm so weird like I
want to keep things as perfect and like
in their package for as long as possible
before I dig into it and destroy it
because that's what I'm gonna end up
doing so this is by Charlotte Tilbury
hold on hold on okay so her name is not
on the packaging but I'm 95% sure it's
Charlotte Tilbury Tilbury Charlotte
Tilbury I'll link it down below 40 bucks
this is called the film-star bronze &amp;amp;
Glow palette so this is a face sculpting
powder and a highlighting powder so
again I told you I've been obsessed with
bronzers and highlighters it's just my
thing this month this sculpting powder
is beautiful and what I love about the
sculpting powder as it's gonna work on
someone who is extremely
they're up to my skin tone maybe even a
shade or two darker it is just so pretty
it's a very neutral tone it's not too
cool and it's not too warm sort of get a
very beautiful minimal looking contour
which I am really into right now I'm not
as into that harsh contour as I used to
be that's like boom
look at my contour bitch like the second
you walk in the room I really like this
more subtle contour kind of glow on the
cheeks right now so the highlight is
beautiful it's not too over-the-top and
too intense it's kind of on the subtle
side but yeah it's still going to make a
statement and it's a beautiful kind of
vanilla champagne shades palette all
around is just great for highlighting
and contouring and again they are born
both more on the subtle side as far as
sculpting and highlighting so love this
palette this would be a great palette
for someone who is trying to begin and
highlighting and contouring because it
won't be overboard I'm going to talk
about another highlighter that I have
been using for the past two months but I
forgot to talk about it last month
because it just slipped my mind
so this is the cabinet Quan celestial
powder I never know how to pronounce
that celestial celestial celestial power
powder
it's a highlighting powder by Kevin oak
wand that's what you need to know and
this is called starlight so this is a
highlighting powder but it is more of a
beige shade as opposed to like a vanilla
champagne kind of bronzy glow this one
is more of a pinky beige so I don't use
this one on the actual tops of my cheeks
I use this one right here on the center
of my cheek so if you can see that glow
right here that I have right now that is
starlight by kavanah Quan and I will
take it and put the majority of it right
here on the apples sorry people aren't
aksinya much I'll put the majority of it
right here on the side of the cheek and
then whatever is left I'll just kind of
brush it backwards so that is what you
are seeing happening on my face right
now I just think it is so absolutely
beautiful so if you're working with a
matte blush for the summer and you don't
want your cheeks to be matte you can
take starlight take a little bit of it
and just lightly dust it over your blush
and I'll just give you that really
beautiful kind of beige glow gorgeous I
think it's so great that it's just a
tiny little compact packaging or like a
normal highlight is like this size you
know this is so tiny and great for
travel more bronzers honestly oh oh my
god
man down
recompose so anyways next I have more
bronzers this is the last bronzer I
promise but I wanted to talk about them
because this was very exciting for me I
don't know why I had all three of them
that was completely pointless I only
needed this one this is the Too Faced
bronzer and we all know about the milk
chocolate chocolate Soleil and it smells
like chocolate and it's all amazing but
this one when I got this in the mail I
was like freaking out finally I'm so
happy to tasted this they came out with
a dark chocolate oh so this is just a
darker version of the milk chocolate 1x2
faison is ever so popular
let me grab the milk chocolate and show
you in comparison okay so this is the
milk chocolate right here and this is
the one that like I'm used to working
with and as you can see when I will next
my skin it doesn't even look like it's
gonna be a bronzer it looks like it's
gonna be a face powder it is a bronzer
though but it's extremely subtle now huh
they have the dark chocolate one which
is just so incredible so beautiful it's
a great same great consistency as this
one but just dark I'm so happy when I
got this in the mail I was screaming I
was like yes so great about it is it is
more of a red tone bronzer which it can
sometimes be hard to find because a lot
of people will come out with more warm
tone bronzers because a lot of people
want like that kind of warm I've been at
the beach kind of summer glow which is
I'm all about that life of course but I
also can appreciate a more neutral to
red tone bronzer as well because this
will work for a lot of other skin tones
who maybe those bronzers look too orange
on them so absolutely beautiful I'm so
excited about this so that is the dark
chocolate Soleil by Too Faced I didn't
give you a swatch because I'm like I'm
so all over the place but this is what
it looks like so you can see on the skin
it's a very neutral kind of red base and
it's nice and pigmented and nice and
dark how I like them so the last thing
that I have of the face is actually a
blush palette by morphe and I have been
using this all month and I am so
ridiculously impressed by these oh by
the way this palette is called 9b I'll
find it I'll link down below for you
guys don't you worry your pretty little
heads so this right here as you can see
we have nine shades and they are so
pigmented
I am extremely impressed for a brand
that has
low prices you would expect these
blushes to not be the high quality that
they are and I know I should have
expected that because that's how their
shadows are so why would I not expect
the exact same thing from the blushes
but these are great I am wearing this
middle one right here on my cheeks today
and I have that heaven of quantum
starlight overtop of it again I film
this look so you'll see it in like a
tutorial soon but these are the so
pigmented that I'll show you how
pigmented they are just with a little
swipe do you see that like that's that's
pigmented people like oh my gosh like
I'll show you a few of them this one has
like can you see on that finger I'm very
very impressed by this palette I love it
I haven't had God that pigmented I
haven't had any issues than being ashy I
had had any issue with them not lasting
on my skin these are great colors for
the summertime and I love that these
colors in here go from like the most
modest of like a fair skinned girl to a
dark chocolate skin like anyone can use
these colors in this palette love so
when I filmed my tanning routine a lot
of you guys were noticing that I was not
using shaving cream in the shower when I
was showing shaving my legs let me just
say that was the most Awkward video I've
ever had to film in my entire life
because I was in my swimsuit and I was
trying to do it so quick and I was just
doing it for the camera so I only shaved
like the bottom half of one leg just to
like show you I'm shaving
so anyways tons of you guys were asking
from that video how I wasn't using
shaving cream and how I don't get um
missing goose bumps how I don't get
razor burn and all that so I thought
that I would tell you guys about the
razor that I use because I struggle
horribly horribly with razor burn I mean
when I was younger like in my teenage
years I would shave and I would be in so
much pain from razor burn that I would
cry and my mom and I we would try to
find everything we could every lotion
every what's it called
shaving cream anything we could find any
gel to help soothe razor burn it was
just bad but then I found these as since
they came out originally like five years
ago these have been the only razors that
I use and I for some reason I'm like
stuck in a pickle and I'm staying at
someone's house and I don't have my own
razor and I use theirs I once again like
in the past
horrible razor burn for some reason
these are just like my knight in shining
armor
so these are the Gillette Venus breeze
and what's great about these is they
have that it's gonna open it it's gonna
open it
so the actual razor blade has a gel bar
on the top and the bottom with very
moisturizing soothing properties in them
which is what makes this so amazing and
for some reason it just works for my
skin in my legs it may not work for you
but oh my gosh it is like my lifesaver
and they have this in a couple of
different ones they have like the Venus
breeze spa and they have this one and
either one of them work for me but as
long as they have this like soothing gel
around it that is a game changer for me
so I will just use whatever products I
have in the shower and I use as far as a
body wash and I do not need to shaving
cream this works just fine this is like
the replacement for the shaving cream so
I thought that would let you guys know
now that this was a favorite of mine
this month but it's been a favorite of
mine since I discovered them when I was
like 20 so that is the Venus breeze
where exactly are they called it doesn't
have a name on it like it's literally
all in Spanish but you guys know what it
is it's the Venus freeze blades with the
gel thing whatever I am so excited to
talk about this perfume but at the same
time I was so bad that you guys could
just smell it through the camera because
I am so bad at describing things but
anyways this is a perfume that I just
recently found in anthropology and the
story behind this is when I was 14 years
old
I got a bottle of this when I was up in
Chicago visiting my sister and I went to
the entire bottle and one summer I loved
it so much I was constantly spraying it
so I completely forgot this perfume
existed and I did not have money for all
those years and I was so broke I could
even afford a bottle of perfume and so I
was at Anthropologie last week with my
friend and I saw this bottle up on the
tower and I was like oh my god like I
had forgotten about this point of my
life where I was so obsessed with this
where I ran over and I smelled it I was
like it's even better than I remember
it's so good so this is just called
auditory let's Vanille
it honestly stays for so long on your
skin that I will spray this in the
morning and that night when I'm in bed
and I've showered my husband will still
tell me oh my gosh you smell like
vanilla it's like I can't get rid of it
which is totally okay because it's so
amazing but if you don't like that scent
it'll suck for you because it'll be on
your body for 24 hours it's warm but
it's not too warm it's not musky it
doesn't smell like amber it literally
just smells like straight-up
vanilla it is so good it is so pure the
smell for yourself I don't know where
else you can find it I will search
online and see if it's anywhere else
other than anthropology for those of you
who maybe don't have one around you I'm
sure you can find it at other places but
it is incredible so if you like anything
vanilla you will be obsessed with this
trust me okay so for my last favorite of
the month it's actually a song I don't
think I've ever like shown a song before
in a favorites video but I have to I'm
sure that you guys know this song even
though I never listen to the radio like
I haven't listened to the radio in
probably eight months but I know that
it's got to be all over the radio right
now John actually brought this song to
me like a month ago and he's like
Jacqueline you need to hear this song
this is a new song by Justin Bieber
you're gonna love it and I was like
Justin Bieber he'd just listen just
listen and it only took about 30 seconds
and I was like oh the fails of the
actual lyrics are awesome like and most
people can relate to the lyrics they're
so good so I'm gonna play you a little
bit of it so you can hear folio sale
you
so yeah that song has pretty much been
on repeat like the entire month
constantly like I play it in every room
and I think John is just like why did I
show this song to her because I am so
obsessed with it I just love that it's
like smooth and kind of quiet and soft
but then the chorus kicks in and it's
just so many feels I have one more song
and then that will complete this
favorites video so I showed this song to
my friend back in the day when she was
going through a really hard time because
I was like this song so applies to your
life right now and she became so in love
with it and it's now been like seven
years since that's happened and she just
texts me a couple of weeks ago with the
link to that song and she was like just
want to say thank you again for showing
me this song all those years back and I
was just like oh my god like it's just
one of those songs I just like forgot
that it existed but I wanted to share it
with you guys because it's not a song
that you're gonna want to listen to and
jam out and be like yes I feel good
about like it's a song that if you are
down if you are kicked if you are
feeling depressed if you're feeling like
what is the meaning of life
this song will pick you back up first
let me give all your eyes out and then
it'll pick you back up it is so so good
it's from the band reliant K some of you
might think that reliant K is lame
that's fine I don't care
um I used to love reliant K their album
mm-hmm was my favorite album and this
was a song that not many people knew
about on that album but it is so good so
I'm gonna play it for you in bits and
pieces but if you're interested in it
goes into it for yourself it's just a
song that'll make you feel like life has
a purpose it'll make you feel like
there's a bigger power and a greater
power out there and it'll put your life
into perspective for you and it's just
such a good
no no
that's exactly what we need
II
seems too much
I just had to show you guys that song
because last night I tweeted a line from
it and it said if the burden seems too
much to bear remember the end will
justify the pain it took to get us there
and I could not believe how many people
responded to me saying I needed to hear
this you have no idea thank you so much
for tweeting this and I thought hey if
you guys need this if you need some
encouragement let me just tell you about
the whole song so you can go listen to
that because if you think that line is
good that song will change your life
like it is so incredible and it just
gives you something to believe in and
it's just great it's hard for me to
listen to it without crying I mean like
even right there I start to choke up
that is let it all out by reliant K I
will link that down below for you guys
if you want to hear the whole song and
like see the lyrics for yourself alright
