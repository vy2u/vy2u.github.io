tutorial this is action I very first
spring makeup look of 2016 like you
don't think much I'm so excited to be
filming this look right now you guys
because I have actually wanted to film
this since oh my god September of last
year holy guacamole
because I saw Diane Von Furstenburg show
at Fashion Week I do not see like in
person I saw you know on the interweb
I saw the models makeup for that show at
Fashion Week and I was just like first
of all Gigi Hadid was in that show thank
you Lord for blessing us would you did
indeed thank you
so I was not inspired necessarily by
Gigi Hadid um but I just saw the overall
all the models and their looks and I was
just so in love with like that kind of
blown out turquoisey greeny blue shade
and I just loved that it didn't have
like a really intense dark crease or a
really intense dark under-eye was just
kind of like all blown out so
beautifully so for today's look I added
false lashes as always you guys know I'm
a little extra that's just how it goes
around here but you guys can so get away
with wearing just absolute no lashes
just a coat or two of mascara for sure I
just wanted to do the little extra drama
because that's me
but this is the easiest look to achieve
of all time honestly when I was filming
it I was like wait I'm almost done like
it went by so badly ously this is very
bold but I just think it's so fun for
spring and summer it's so girly it'll
make a statement and it's easy to
achieve so I hope you enjoy thank you so
much for watching the video and I'll see
you very soon
mmm bye guys hey guys let's go ahead and
get started on this turquoise mermaid II
blue tutorial but I still have no idea
what I'm calling first thing I do is
start by priming my face and I'm using
the Becca backlight priming filter this
is my favorite primer at the moment
because it just gives such a beautiful
glow without being oily or glittery then
I'm going to go in Foundation and I'm
going to start off with the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD stick foundation one
stripe on each cheek and one across the
chin and then I'm going to mix it with
the ex1 and visit where foundation these
are two of my favorites I personally
love mixing
foundations because I feel like you're
not always gonna find one foundation
that does everything for you so when you
have a couple that you like maybe one
gives really amazing coverage and the
other one has the finish that you want
so you mix those two together and now
it's like you are your own chemist in
your own lab just whipping up your own
foundation so that's what I love about
mixing foundations I have been doing
this for years and it's my favorite way
to apply foundation is mixing them
sometimes I will mix Giorgio Armani with
L'Oreal True Match and I love it
anyways I'm going to be color correcting
at my nostril area because I always get
red here which is just a hormonal thing
a lot of women get redness there in case
you're curious urban decay came off new
color correctors I was not expecting him
to be this pigmented which is great but
it was a little difficult to blend in
that area just letting you know because
this was my first time using that green
shade I'm using the same Urban Decay
weightless concealer all around the eye
area and I'm gonna take a very damp
Beauty Blender I get it soaking wet
under the sink squeeze squeeze squeeze
like 15 times then I just kind of put it
in a towel or paper towels kind of wring
it out a little bit but I like to leave
a lot of moisture in there because it
just makes the makeup look so smooth and
it will pick up any excess product so if
you take on too much and you're way too
heavy-handed this will help blend it out
using a damp Beauty Blender which is why
I love it so much so as you can see I'm
blending out that green color corrector
and I felt like it was making my upper
lip look a little funky so I'm just
going to put a little bit more concealer
there and just go over it with the
Beauty Blender and then I felt like my
face was looking uneven so then I had to
give a little flower in the center of
the forehead and blend that out so
you're gonna see me doing a lot of steps
to even out my face I just felt like I
wasn't looking like I was one tone so
now I'm gonna do a little bit on my chin
I'm also gonna go directly out from my
lip back towards my ear if you have like
gels or like saggy skin here or
sometimes you just feel like you have
like fat they're almost I'm going ahead
and putting a lighter concealer like
that can kind of help to pull it back if
you contour if you don't contour it
might do the opposite but if you contour
this one kind of help to pull it back
and recede it a little bit if that makes
sense so I'm just running over my whole
face making sure there's no lines no
creases no extra cake face product and
then I'm going to set my under eye area
I'm using the Anastasia um banana powder
this is sold
Epperly and also in her original contour
kit and i am just using the morphe end
force wait no this is the m5 3-0 brush
which I prefer for contouring but I use
it for my under eye now I'm going to go
in with my favorite face powder of all
slime this is Giorgio Armani a luminous
silk powder and I am absolutely in love
with it now for the eyes I'm going to
start off with using makeup geek shor
thing which i think is such a cute name
because it's sure like SH Oh aren't you
so cute and I am using a blending brush
to apply this in my entire crease area
and I'm keeping it rather low today I
don't want it to go up too high all the
way to the brow because will start to
look very runway very quickly and I want
to make it a little bit more wearable so
I'm going to keep it nice and low in the
crease and I am using a morphe m4 4-1
brush to do so now I'm going to go in
with this gorgeous pigment that I am in
love with again this is my makeup geek
and it's called chameleon such a
beautiful high intense pigment but I am
going to set my under eyes so this is
then look really intense and scary but
what it's going to do is by pressing on
this translucent powder and just letting
it sit there it's going to catch any
fallout as I'm working on my eyes and
then when I'm done I'll wipe it away and
all the fallout will disappear this way
I can kind of be a little bit sloppier
and go quicker when I'm working on the
eyes and not worry about making a mess
of my foundation and my concealer my
powder that I just got done finishing so
now I'm just going to take a sigma e55
and apply this all over the entire lid
I'm going to make sure to get it all the
way up in the crease as you will see I
kind of start off with patting rubbing
motions and then I like to go back and
forth and windshield wiper motions to
make sure that I get it all the way up
in that crease I kind of step back and
make sure that it's all even and if you
want to add some fix plus to make it
more intense you totally can if you want
to make it metallic I'm going in with a
little bit of aqua eyeshadow by
anastasiya not gonna lie this part is
not necessary but I own the eyeshadow
and I was sitting in front of me I
thought it was pretty and I wanted to
have some fun and at it as you can see
it's very pale I just wanted to use it
just to make that crease just give a
little bit more pop but again not
necessary but I do think it looks really
pretty just touching up a little bit and
adding a little bit more of that pigment
just to make sure that it's nice and
bright and shiny because I don't want to
lose that like high in
hence gorgeous frosty blue right there
on the lid now I'm going to just wipe
away and as you see everything
disappears any fallout the powder
disappears it's like it was never there
in the first place just looks nice and
clean so you don't have any messy cheeks
that you need to clean up now because
that can be frustrating
now I'm gonna fill in my brows not gonna
do anything too intense I keep filling
in my brows less and less and less
recently when I go back to my older
videos I'm just like oh my gosh looks
like I have to like brown worms on my
face and I just like filling them in a
little bit less now and every day I feel
like I do it less and less and less than
a before so I am using the Anastasia
brow definer this is my ride-or-die brow
products I swear like oh there's never
been anything like this before it is my
one and only so now I'm going to take a
little bit more of that Anastasia
aqua eyeshadow which is an all matte
pale shade I'm going to go all the way
from the outer corner to the inner
corner but I'm not going to bring it all
the way in and wrap it around the inner
corner just as you see I'm stopping
right there when I get to the inner
tear-duct then I'm gonna go in with
makeup geek dragonfly oh my goodness
gracious this has got to be like one of
my favorite colors of all time like it
just speaks to me when I did my palette
video several weeks back I had a ton of
requests to use this shade in a tutorial
so here it is if you're intimidated by
this overall look you could just put
this on your lower lashline as a pop of
color and just do no shadow on top which
is some winged liner and it would look
really really beautiful for spring and
summer so I'm just blending that out
with no additional products on my brush
I'm just running over it to make sure
that it's not harsh or SuperDuper
intense and then I'm gonna go in with
nylon by Mac this is my favorite
highlight shade but honestly it goes so
perfect with the look that I wouldn't
even think about doing a different color
because of that intense Frost and a
yellow undertone it really is flattering
to these shades but I felt as though it
was just too bright directly in that
inner corner so I wanted to blend out so
I grabbed a synthetic brush this is the
Mac 242 and a little bit of the
Anastasia banana powder and I'm going to
blend that out so we have more of an
overall brightening effect
I just want my look to be very whimsical
and just brightening all around so I am
popping a little bit of that nylon on
the brow bone as well and then I'm going
to take a little bit of a fascinating I
pull by Mac which
very creamy I called it a stark white
and I'm gonna line my inner eyes I loved
the way this looked with that bright
inner corner and that white on the lash
line I just think it's very very
different and like I said just kind of
gives it a fairy whimsical vibe I'm
going to pop on some lashes these are
one of my absolute favorites first I'm
going to give my lashes a quick coat of
mascara and I'm going to be using the
velour lashes in the style wispy and
edge I believe they're called maybe it's
wispy and edgy I will put it in the
bottom bar down below for you guys who
are interested but they're one of my
favorite lashes because they are drama
while still being on the natural s side
I just think they're so beautiful I'm
going to make sure to get it pretty
tight on my lash line since I'm not
wearing any a liner today that way it
looks as natural as possible you like
I'm using the word natural right now I'm
coating my entire eyes with turquoise so
now I'm going to bronze the face and I'm
going to the face not my face not your
face but bronze the face I'm going to be
using Mac give me Sun I didn't want to
really contour today I just wanted to
really warm up the skin that was the
look I was going for just keeping
everything really nice and warm with
these really light fresh colorful eyes
so I am using a huge fat brush this is
by Tom Ford it is ridiculously expensive
you guys oh my god once you use it once
you never want to use anything else
because it's just so amazing give you
dump board but I'm going to go around
the entire edges of my face on the
cheekbones the forehead and then down by
the neck and then of course I'm going to
put some superglue and my brow is just
real quick before we finish off this
look because Anastacio makes the best
brow gel in the entire world
it is gorilla glue for the eyes like
I've said before and then for blush I'm
going to use two Mac blushes I'm using
Keamy petal and modern Mandarin modern
Mandarin is the orange PE petal is a
pink we mix those two together again
just because I have them right there at
my disposal and I am using one of those
morphe brushes with like the bling
collection that came out I've been
loving that one recently a for blush I'm
going take a little bit of the RCM a no
color powder this is the same
translucent powder I use our knees my
eyes and I'm just going to kind of wash
this out a little bit so I felt like it
just looked a little sloppy and I wanted
to clean up just a little bit so I make
a huge stripe and I just immediately
wash it away so it's not necessarily
it's just cleaning it a little bit so
that it's not so intense and just messy
down there
it took the hourglass highlighting
palette and I'm going to just put this
all over the entire apple of my cheek
area do you see all those breakouts
right now
I've had this texture on the right side
of my cheek only for about the past
seven to ten days I don't know what's
causing it but it's it's there honey
it's there I'm gonna go in with this
malli beauty highlight so pretty so
jumbo it's humongous and so exciting
it's called the effortless airbrush
highlighter I'm gonna take a little bit
that and pop it on the top of my cheeks
I really shouldn't be really intensely
highlighting since I have so much
texture on my right cheek right now but
I was just like you know what I'm doing
it I'm doing it for the sake of the
video because I think it looks really
pretty with the highlight now I'm using
bite Beauty souffle lipstick and I'm
going to give it a coat of gloss this is
buxom my tie this is an option for you
it's very very baby pink with a pinch of
coral I am gonna change my lip in a
second though because I changed my mind
I'm gonna give my lower lashes a coat of
mascara I'm using Kevin a Quan mascara
it's a really great mascara if you want
to get precise I decided to change my
lips so I used my Beauty honeycomb which
is a great neutral and then I'm going to
top it off with a little bit of souffle
and I'm not gonna put a gloss over it
I felt like this was a little bit more
what I personally was looking for with
this look overall but of course I'm
going to set myself with Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray and we are
done
I hope you enjoyed this video you guys
thanks so much for watching and I will
see you guys very soon
I gotta go I gotta go I'm hungry I gotta
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
