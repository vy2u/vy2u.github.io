my with a bunch of a July I'm going to
be doing my August Beauty favorites who
I believe the years literally going by
this fact that is sick and wrong anyways
I'm gonna jump in and not ramble because
I have a lot to talk about like a lot so
I'm I'm just going to start now
first okay the first day were to talk
about our morphe eyeshadows I did
mention morphe eyeshadows and a video of
mine a couple weeks back and I was just
so excited I had to share it with you
then I couldn't wait to my favorites
video but I want to go over them again
because if you have been asking if this
palette is a palette that is already
pre-made you guys can purchase online
and know this palette is something that
I went to the store walls in California
and I picked out each individual shadow
and I put them in this palette so I
created this myself this is not a
premade palette even though they have
tons of palettes that are beautiful that
you guys can purchase just as is these
are individual shadows that I picked out
and I just put in the morphe brushes
palette I do want to put this in a Z
palette eventually because I like the
see-through top but for now this is what
we're working with I have not been
disappointed by one shadow so far every
single one of them that I have used I
loved I have no complaints they're
pigmented they're blendable they're
smooth they're creamy the fact they're
two dollars a piece what every single
time I say it I'm like two dollars two
dollars like when I'm doing my makeup
everyday I'm like two dollars so so far
my favorite eyeshadow is this one right
here which is number 74 I am wearing a
little bit of this on the outer corner
of my lid today you can just see like
how gorgeous and creamy and pigmented
these shadows are they're just they're
freakin beautiful a lot of you been
asking you to do like an in-depth video
swatches or a blog post if you guys want
me to go even more and deputy shadows
let me know I'd be more than happy but
honestly they're just good shadows and
for two dollars what can you complain
about honestly and it's funny because
after I did that video a couple weeks
back talking about these their website
actually crashed a couple hours later
because they had no idea that I was
gonna be talking about it they were not
expecting traffic or anything like that
and so many of you guys ran they're so
excited about these two dollar
eyeshadows the website crash sniff
server couldn't handle all of it then
the next day the owner contacted me and
she's looking she's like I have not
slept in 24 hours I'm so stressed the
websites down
and I was like oh my god and so she
literally felt so bad that she was like
I want to offer your subscribers a
discount code and I'm like a discount
code these eyeshadows are already a disc
hoping code but she said this she just
felt so bad and she was so appreciative
for you guys being so excited about
these shadows so she wants to offer my
subscribers a 10% off discount code and
I'm sorry for the website crashing and a
thankful appreciation to you guys as
well so the name of the discount code is
Jack Attack so if you guys I guess I
know this great base I think anybody
whose name Jacqueline or Jackie has
their whole life had people refer to
them as Jack Attack at one point or
another um so yeah the discount code is
Jack Attack for any of you who want to
try anymore feet products you can do so
and save yourself ten percent off which
i think is really cool especially since
everything is already so cheap it's like
okay that's freaking awesome I'm just
going to stick with eye shadow since we
started with eyes and I want to talk
about the makeup forever artist eye
shadows that came out earlier this month
makeup forever be formulated all their
eyeshadows and came out with over 200
colors 200 colors like crazy so these
are ones I purchased right here I just
put them in a Z palette that I already
owned um they do come with little
compact you can pop in and it helps save
money you get a better deal but since I
wanted so many I was like I'm fine I'll
put Isabel so these are the colors I
have right here I absolutely love them
they are so pigmented they're so creamy
the best part about it is the
pigmentation these things are pigment
tip these are both matte shades and you
can see just lightly swatching how crazy
pigmented these shadows are that is the
best part about it and when they go on
they don't go on blotchy as you can see
sometimes matte shadows will just kind
of drag across the skin very dry these
don't do that they're not chalky there
are really nice matte formulation so
pigmented so blendable they're just
beautiful I will say with these bottom
four right here I'll show you close-up
so you can kind of see the sparkle and
these four right here these are very
glittery so when you're working with
them
I personally treat them like a Mack
pressed pigment in the sense that I'm
aware they're going to have a lot of
fallout because of the glitter
so what i do is i prime my lid with
two-faced glitter glue and then i pack
these on top and i will have no fallout
i am wearing this one right now which is
d seven one two let me zoom you in so
you guys can see what it looks like on
my eyes all over that lid area that's
what i'm wearing you can see it's very
sparkly it's very glittery it's such a
gorgeous color and so let me let me get
it together and this one right here this
is one - for one for such a gorgeous
highlight i havent on my inner corner
and as my brow bone highlight and i just
absolutely love it it's beautiful like a
yellowy gold highlight but yet someone
who's very fair can still wear this and
it's not going to be too gold if you
know what I'm saying so make up forever
artist eye shadows are absolutely
brilliant even though I've only owned
them for a couple of weeks I already see
myself in the future going and buying
even more because they're one of my
finger eyeshadows right now next and I
have one more eye shadow and this one
I'm a little confused not because I
don't actually know the exact name of
the brand
I think it's ardency Inn I kept the
packaging of it because the actual
packaging of the product only has a can
H with lines on it it doesn't say name
of the brand so this right here you can
find on Sephora calm it does not have it
in my local Sephora so I don't know if
it's in stores I just know it's not in
mine but it is on Sephora calm so I'll
link it below for you guys of course
with everything else and this is in the
shade royal oh my god you guys just get
ready so this right oh my god so this
right here is the shade tip of my finger
look how dirty I am right here I'll show
you how pigmented it is look at that are
you how gorgeous is this is like the
prettiest purple I've ever seen in my
life it's so beautiful
so yes I had to share this with you guys
they're just so gorgeous they are pricey
but holy guacamole this is the kind of
product that will last you a lifetime
because it's so pigmented that you're
not going to have to be using a lot of
it like it is crazy it literally feels
like a condensed press pigments I
honestly no I just did a tutorial using
purples I honestly want to do another
tutorial with this being the main color
because it's just so gorgeous so if you
guys wanna see a really really colorful
purple tutorial let me know in the
comments below
I would be very excited to use this
color next I'm going to move on to lip
products and you guys know that this
would not be a favorites video if I did
not mention bite Beauty I've actually
talked about this formulation before and
this is the high pigmented pencil high
pigmented high pigment oh hi okay high
pigment pencil in the shade bouquet I've
been wearing it constantly it's just a
really warm pink because in the fall
like that really lavender type pink a
lot of people stop wearing it because
it's much more spring but a pink like
this is wearable and fall in winter
because it's more on the warm side and
it's not Wow in your face like spring
summer lip it's very beautiful and very
wearable on so many different skin tones
so that is bouquet I've been so excited
to mention this gloss even though like
it's not going to come as a surprise at
all that I'm talking about it but I have
just been using it non-stop since it
came out I think you might about a month
and a half ago and it is the Gerard
cosmetics gloss in the shade shimmer of
hope first of all like I love love this
gold packaging on top it's gorgeous
this is just the perfect perfect nude
gloss ever and their glosses are just so
opaque and pigmented like I love them
let me zoom you in a little bit since
you can see you can see like it's just
so opaque it almost looks like a creamy
lipstick not even a gloss in this shade
is just so beautiful for anybody
especially if you have on a lip color
that you want to mute out the color a
little bit you don't want to be as
intense this gloss is gorgeous I've been
wearing it over Bouquet a lot this month
from my skin tone personally shimmer at
Hope is just like that perfect nude
gloss there's nothing about it I would
change its perfection one more lip item
and I have been really excited to
actually talk about these because I've
got asking you guys a lot where I think
about them and they are the LA girl
glazed it's always cool oh my girl
glazed lip paint there is not a period
after glaze Jacqueline la girl glaze lip
paint and they just came out I don't
know with how many new colors they came
out with but I bought four of them soon
as I saw that they came out with some
neutrals because the LA girl glaze lip
paints okay that's like a really long
thing the glaze lip paints by la girl
they did have tons of colors before but
they were all very very bright and I
person
am NOT someone who goes towards really
bright glosses i usually do bright
lipsticks but when it comes to glosses i
like a little bit more neutral just
because i don't like a really shiny
bright color on myself and also you to
reapply constantly otherwise it's like a
hot mess and sometimes it can bleed and
like run off your lips onto your face I
just don't like the hassle so I
personally like more neutral shades of
glosses so as soon as I saw it they came
out with these I was like so the first
one is whisper the second one I cannot
see what it says on the bottle so I'll
leave it down below the third one is
flirt and then the last one is whimsical
the word pigmented doesn't even do these
lip paints justice because they're so
overly saturated they're so beautiful
they're so creamy and they just gorgeous
on the lips and the best part is they
smell like the most amazing peppermint
ever and I love anything that smells
like peppermint products I have been
arguing with myself whether or not I'm
going to talk about it but I finally
decided that I am going to talk about it
I'm going to try to talk quickly because
I have a lot to say about it so this
right here is a sunless tanner from the
brand loving tan they are a brand from
Australia and if you're on Instagram a
lot then you may have heard from them
because that's how I heard from them was
on Instagram and I immediately ran to
the website and bought their products
and this right here is literally the
best sunless tanner I have ever used in
my life and I feel like I have tried
everything I probably tried it between
40 and 50 sunless Tanner's in my life
minimum from the lowest price to the
highest I've tried it all because I'm
Hale and I don't like it this right here
is the best one I've ever used for every
single reason first of all it lasted for
a full five to six days and when it
started fading it faded very slowly and
very smoothly and it didn't have patches
it didn't dry my skin out it didn't you
sensitive which is awesome cuz I'm very
very sensitive it just looked beautiful
the color itself was such a golden
bronze glow it didn't make me like a
nasty brown it didn't make me like a red
Brown it just made me look like such a
beautiful natural glow it's just
absolutely gorgeous and the best part
about it is you only have to leave this
on for two hours for someone like me
does so ideal because this is the two
hour expressed Salah deluxe
the Moose and ashamed Ducks they also
have an ultra dark but I did not need
any darker than this because I was
shocked by how dark I was after two
hours so for me I hate some was Tanner I
hate the way it feels I hate the way it
smells I have major sensory issues so I
literally just feel like I've Mabel
syrup on my body I'm not one of those
people that can be like oh my god nice
almost tan and go run some errands no
it's literally an all-day event like my
schedule is clear and I'm like I'm
sunless tanning today and I'm literally
on my couch like oh I tolls on every
surface because I'm just like oh God so
does god thing I hate the way I feel
it's just sticky and disgusting smelling
and just miserable am i selling this to
you I absolutely can't stand most of
those tanners for those reasons but this
the stickiness was so bearable it's
probably the least sticky sell eskender
i've ever used because everything just
feels like maple syrup on me and then to
top it off I only had to leave on for
two hours and I figured okay I'll leave
it on for two hours and when I shower
it's gonna be like a little glow but no
when I got the shower I was like oh damn
I'm dark like it was a big difference so
I actually love this I highly recommend
it it's absolutely gorgeous but the
reason that I was really nervous about
talking about in the first place is
because this brand is from Australia and
the shipping costs are crazy it cost
twenty dollars to ship to the US which
is very frustrating and so it's funny
this I bought this product and a week
after I bought it the company emailed me
and they were like we sell it you bought
our product Jacqueline how do you feel
about it do you like it and I was like
yes I actually love it it's absolutely
amazing the only con is the shipping and
I told them that I would love to mention
it to you guys I would love to talk to
you about it but the shipping is just
not gonna fly because so expensive and I
would be frustrated I was watching
someone rave about a tanner and then
you're like okay now to pick $20 for
shipping um they told me there's nothing
they can do for shipping they said that
they already lose money on shipping and
it cannot give any codes to help
discount shipping but they said what
they could do to help justify the
shipping is they could give my
subscribers a free back applicator in
order to kind of balance out the crazy
shipping and the back applicator is a
twenty dollar product that believe like
20 to 22 dollars and so it's the same
price as shipping so it's kind of like
but I just felt like I had to mention it
because I'm not
going to sit here like hide it from you
guys because those of you who do want to
buy it I want to let you know this is my
favorite sunless tanner ever use honest
to god you guys and so I just like I had
to tell you cuz I've been not talking
about it for a month and a half and so I
just figured that I had to mention it so
yes it's awesome do you but you will get
a free applicator with the discount code
Jaclyn I believe it is but I will link
it down below for those of you who want
to give it a try and I'm sorry that I
fell about that frog of this from
Australia I do want to talk about the
makeup geek brush that I have been using
recently to apply my foundation you guys
are so funny every time I use this brush
in the comments you guys are like what
happened did he'll freeze over why
aren't you using your Sigma f80 and I
still love the Sigma f80 brush I've used
it for years it's amazing
but recently I've just been grabbing
this one more often this is the makeup
geek foundation stippling brush the only
difference I'll show you is the handle
on the makeup geek one is longer and
then the actual brush hairs on the
makeup geek are just about centimeter
shorter than the ones on this Sigma so
the difference is that's going to make
when applying foundation is you're going
to have to use less products since
there's less hairs it's not going to
seal and soak up as much foundation from
you so less product is going to go
further on the face and I just like it
short and it's fat and it just gets the
job done and I really like it if you own
is Sigma f80 you don't need to make a
geek and if you own the makeup geek you
don't need the Sigma you know what I'm
saying like so the product that I'm most
excited about talking about in this
video of course I was
I literally screamed when I saw that
this was coming out I was like chef this
is a new Becca highlighter and if you
guys know me you know that I have been
like opal obsessed for months and months
and months and this one is so gorgeous
this is the new Becca highlighter in a
shade rose gold and I have used this
every single time that I've done my
makeup since the day I got it like now I
don't even know how to do my makeup
without it I am wearing it on my cheeks
right now that's what that shimmer is it
is just so beautiful let me zoom you in
a little bit so you can see it I love
they put these shapes in there in this
print the other ones are completely
smooth and flat and I just love that
they put that in there it's such a
pretty effect and this is what it looks
like right here I'm so messy right now
oh my god look at me I'm going to swatch
this on my shoulder because I literally
have nowhere else to swatch it for you
so as you guys can see it do you see
that do you see how gorgeous that is
they could not have done a better job
developing this it's absolute order so
like I said it is what's on my cheeks
today I've been using it constantly and
I have to be honest you guys I've never
gotten as many compliments on my cheeks
ever in my life since I've been wearing
this I feel like every single time I
leave the house somebody is like I'm
sorry but what are you wearing on your
cheeks I'm like rose gold and what I
love about it is that I've been trying
to find a beautiful rose gold eyeshadow
for such a long time and I just can't I
can't find one that's creamy enough and
pigmented enough but now that this is
out it's perfect because I use
highlighters and blushes and bronzers
and stuff like that as eyeshadows all
the time this is bors on the eyes so
this is Becca and rose gold look so
pretty so last but not least I want to
talk about something that I've never
talked about here on my channel before
which is so weird because if you know me
you know that I literally have the most
unforgivable collection of Bath and Body
Works candles and I have to mention the
new fall candles because they are just
so amazing so Bath and Body Works
candles are typically $22 I believe but
they have a sale most every single month
where you can get two for twenty-two and
so I never buy them full price like
always wait so that I can get two for
$22 and it happens all the time and
sometimes I'll let you guys know on
Twitter if you guys are interested
because I just get so excited and the
blackberry bramble tea is my absolute
favorite oh my god I would you guys
could smell so bad I sort of digs it
literally smells like fresh blueberry
muffins like freaking Aunt Jemima in the
kitchen whipping up a batch of blueberry
muffin that's what this smells like it
is so amazing and all their new pumpkin
candles are out like a pumpkin cupcake
and their pumpkin waffles and oh my god
like my house smells like a damn bakery
and it's amazing I'm starving 24/7 it's
fine
that completes my August favorites I
really hope that you guys enjoy this
video as always please leave me comments
of your favorites for the month of
August down below that is my favorite
time of the month is reading your
comments on my monthly favorites of all
your amazing product read me right right
I'm done recommendations thank you so
much for watching I love you guys and
I'll see you soon bye

my move
