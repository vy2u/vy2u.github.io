finally be doing my best of beauty for
year 2014 if you are not familiar with
that video is then basically it is just
a roundup of my favorite products in the
entire year of 2014 so that is why this
video is extremely long I'm only
assuming because even though I tried so
hard to narrow it down I still have
probably like 50 products to talk about
I have to make a quick disclaimer before
jumping into the video and that is I'm
probably going to very much overuse the
words absolutely gorgeous beautiful
perfection
amazing amazing buttery and creamy but
it could make if I'm drinking game I'm
just kidding so I do have three
categories I have face eyes and lips and
I'm gonna start off with face because it
just makes sense in my mind and I also
have the most products in the face
category so let's start with that I just
realized that I have like nothing from a
big store people are going to be past so
the first thing I want to talk about is
a face primer and I only have two days
primers from the year 2014 I'm not huge
on primers but both of these are very
similar and what they do the first one
is the Chanel lay Blanc de Chanel sheer
eliminating base this of course is more
expensive because it is Chanel but the
reason that I love this is because you
can wear it with or without foundation
you can put it under your foundation you
can mix it with your foundation or you
can put on your bare skin and not wear
foundation and it just gives such a
beautiful glowing just healthy just
luminous base to the skin it really is
gorgeous now I can't say that this makes
my foundation last longer because I
personally don't have issues my
foundation coming off because the fact
that I am dry my skin just kind of holds
on to everything um but this just makes
my foundation and my skin just looks so
pretty and glowy the next one is from
L'Oreal and this is from the drugstore
of course and this is the magic lumi
light enthusing primer i use this primer
for probably two and a half years but
this past summer i really fell in love
with it again and just reminded myself
as to why i loved it so much I did have
to replace it because my old one was
like super duper watery so this is
definitely something that I would
recommend to replace every year but I
use this one the exact same way that I
use this one the only difference is this
one is a little bit thicker and this one
is a little bit more watery so if you
are oily but you want to try something
is going to give you that illuminating
dewy finish I would probably
go towards the Loreal one because it's
not as thick as this chanel one if you
know what I mean
okay did that make sense no okay
I had to really narrow down the
foundations that I wanted to talk about
because I do love foundations but this
one is very obvious I have to mention
this this is the Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation I did mention this in my
video last year I'm sure because this
has been my favorite number one
foundation now for about two years I
believe and I just love this because as
it says luminous silk it just gives the
most beautiful luminous dewy glowy
finish if you are oily this will kind of
slide right off the face you will have
to powder it so I've never recommended
it to someone who's oily because why are
you going to spend so much money on a
bottle of foundation that is known for
its luminosity and then go over with
powder and matte it out you know what
I'm saying like you could get a better
bang for your buck if you're oily but I
really recommend this to those of you
who are normal to dry skin and you want
something is going to make your skin
look really healthy and dewy and glowy
this is just absolutely gorgeous I'm
pretty sure that the luminous foundation
will be one of my favorites for my whole
life I'll always go back to it another
foundation that I rediscovered this year
and it just kind of reminded me why I
used to love it so much is the Make Up
For Ever HD foundation I'm in shade
neutral 1 2 3 in case you're curious but
this foundation has been so hyped up for
years and honestly I think that there's
a good reason for it it's such a great
foundation for such a large wide of skin
types you know what I'm saying like oily
combination and dry can all wear this of
course is going to wear different on
everybody if you're oily it's going to
be more dewy you're dry it's any more
matte but overall it's a very natural
finish it's a full coverage and it
really just does look beautiful and it
looks gorgeous
on camera if you have a camera with a
flash like I do this is not going to
make your face whiteout it's just gonna
make it look very very beautiful this is
a foundation I just discovered in the
year 2014 and this is the Smashbox to do
skin 15-hour we're hydrating foundation
when I first picked this up I thought
ooh hydrating it's going to make me look
dewy but lasts 15 hours no it did not
make me look dewy and a very natural to
matte finish on me personally but this
is seriously like glue to the skin
it is like it reminds me very much of
mac prolongwear foundation in the sense
that it goes on super creamy super
luxurious ten minutes later you're like
oh my god it is like glue on your face
which I kind of love especially the
summertime if you want a full coverage
foundation you want one that is not
going to move especially if you live
somewhere extremely humid like I do in
Florida this is like this is all you can
ask for so this is the Smashbox Studios
skin 15 hour wear now for a concealer I
only have one concealer to talk about
and that is the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer um there were other concealers
I tried out this year but honestly since
this is my ground of all my favorites I
have to talk about these because they're
honestly the only ones that I am like
you know what I'm saying like these are
my bitches I mix the shade NW 25 and W
20 because I'm high-maintenance when it
comes to my makeup you can ask my
husband I'm seriously not high
maintenance like in other areas of my
life like I'm very independent but when
it comes to makeup so high - it's
ridiculous
it is a full full coverage and it has
technology built into it so it's not
supposed to crease the creaseless
technology so it personally does not
crease on me but I always said it with a
powder and I always have and it also is
an amazing eyeshadow primer so I
absolutely love the Mac Pro Longwear
concealer I've never tried a concealer
that I like as much as that one moving
on to other areas of the face this is
the perricone MD no bronzer bronzer OH
oh my gosh this is an absolutely
incredible product it really sticks out
to me for the year of 2014 and I use
this in my no makeup makeup look which
was my summer edition I believe but
that's the only video I've used on
camera but I use it off camera all the
time my favorite way to actually use
this is when I have no makeup on I'll
take a synthetic brush and I'll take
this and I'll just put it on the cheeks
and the forehead and the chin just the
areas at the Sun would hit the base and
it just looks so beautiful it looks like
you spent the day at the pool you can
even take this put a little bit over the
top of your shoulders a little on your
collarbone and it's just gonna look so
glowy and bronzy but so natural I love
love love this product I just mentioned
these in my video was methods December
favorites right yes my December
favorites but I had to talk about them
because even though I was introduced to
them in the
smell of the year they I just like
obsessed with them I can't stop using
them and they add a smashbox
step-by-step contour sticks so they come
with three different colors in the box
they come with a highlighting a
contouring and a bronzer me pop it off
so you can see it they look like in this
and the ones that i use the most are the
contour and the highlight so the way I
will use it is I will take the contour
stick I'll dry out draw a line by the
back of my ears a little bit my forehead
and then I would go in and just blend it
out with a synthetic brush and I
absolutely love the color they're so
creamy they're so blendable and then I
will take the highlighting stick and I
will carve out that contour and really
make it pop with the highlighting sticks
so I have been loving loving this if you
guys want to see like an in depth cream
contour video let me know because I have
been really into cream contouring again
recently because I just think it looks
so natural and pretty so these right
here I just think are like perfect even
if you're a beginner this would be like
a perfect little package kit to pick up
because you have your contour your
highlight and your bronze and these
three creamy blendable shades right here
so that is by Smashbox
okay so sticking with cream products
this is the sole a tenday Chenault
everything is always so tundish Anna so
this is a cream bronzer by Chanel I've
owned this now for at least two years
and look at this like it looks it
doesn't have a dent in it and I
consistently use this all the time like
this isn't something that I haven't
touched for six months in order saying I
use it all the time and it's still going
strong like this is worth the money I
think so anyways what I love about this
is it's so natural I am wearing this
today along with the Smashbox contour
sticks that is what I use for this
situation it is just so natural and just
so beautiful in the way it blends out is
just impeccable sticking up with
bronzers I only wanted to pick out one
bronzer that really stuck out to me and
so I figured that I would choose this
one because I used it all year long and
that is the a Mac Studio hair blend
pressed powder in the shade and dark
this is not technically a bronzer but
this is what I use for bronzer all year
long and it's just a really great tip
something that I learned when I was
working at Mac and freelancing a lot is
what I would do as opposed to using an
actual bronzer as I would find my
favorite powder and then I would buy it
in the
that would work for me to bronze and/or
contour with and that is what I would
use as opposed to a technical bronzer
because for instance like toothpaste
chocolate milk chocolate chocolate
Soleil where it's called isn't going to
work as a bronzing powder for everyone
at all skin tones you know I'm saying
might be too muddy or too ashy on this
person and then perfect on you so what I
really love about this method is you
find a powder that you will absolutely
love and it's like yes this powder is
gorgeous well then go to the store and
pick it out in the shade that you would
like to contour or bronze with and boom
you have your perfect match made in
heaven you have the consistency you want
and the color you want you know what I'm
saying so that's always been my favorite
way to pick out bronzers so with that
being said the Mac Studio Carolyn price
powder in the shade dark is mine okay
let's talk about highlights
you know what's coming oh my god hello
beautiful oh my god you guys honestly I
think I've every single part that I'm
going to mention this is like my number
one makeup product of the year 2014 just
because the fact that like how I
discovered a brand that I had never
heard of before and I just love them now
so basically what happened is I was on
sabor calm one day and I was shopping
and it said add 16 more dollars to your
cart and get free shipping and I was
like so I just started skating the
website and I came across this product
right here and I had never heard of it
before and I was like Oh highlighter and
you know I love highlighters so I looked
it up on Google and I found nothing like
no reviews no swatches nothing and I was
like okay sketchy now I really want to
try it so put it in my bag it came to my
house and when I got it I was like oh it
wasn't finding a treasure chest full of
gold I swear I was like how come I've
never heard of this before
what is life and if you followed me in
the year 2014 you may remember the video
where I was like hello like this
highlighter is everything so it write a
brand Becca cosmetics and it's in the
shade opal they do have a few other ones
they have moonstone which is really
beautiful for those of you who are very
light and shade and you can't really do
like a bronzy otherwise it look kind of
muddy if you're very fair moon so be
perfect for you if you're darker topaz
is absolutely gorgeous and then they
also have rose gold amazing and then
they have a good new champagne one oh
well that was my absolute favorite and I
think it's the most universal all that
my
wearing it right now my cheekbones my
brow bone my inner corner of my eye I
honestly made Becca opal my bitch this
year and that's our love-story romantic
huh I have two more highlighters I
discovered in 2014 that I just
absolutely love and this is the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade of luminous light I think the
first time I use this was in my Bridal
tutorial but I've used it quite a bit I
absolutely love it I would say out of
any highlighter I've ever tried this is
the most natural I really recommend it
for those of you who are brides because
it just gives such a gorgeous Bridal
Beauty like you're glowing from within
or if you have more mature skin and
you're worried about fine lines and
wrinkles I would try this because it is
so natural looking and just so beautiful
that it's not gonna really emphasize or
accentuate any like problematic areas or
fine lines that you might be concerned
about so hourglass ambient lighting
powder and luminous lights the next one
is that Bobby Brown shimmer brick and
you know I'm obsessed Bob Brown Jim
Brooks I think I have every single one
of them that have launched in the past
couple of years because every single one
of them are just so beautiful in their
own unique way and this is in a shade
beige which is absolutely gorgeous it is
so beautiful it's a little bit darker
when it applies then I'm Becca opal but
I just love it it is gorgeous for the
tops of the cheekbones it is gorgeous as
a highlight I would recommend though
that you have a little bit of color in
your skin if you're extremely fair this
might look a little kind of muddy and to
bronzy as a highlight on you but overall
it is just absolutely beautiful okay so
for my favorite blushes of the year I
picked out brands as opposed to specific
shades and my first one are the makeup
geek blushes I did a review on these and
I don't do kind of targeted reviews on
many products only products that I
really really love so that's why I did
one on these blushes because these
blushes are just phenomenal there are a
great price I don't know specifically I
think they're nine dollars a piece like
nine something but whatever they are
they are an amazing price and they are
just so gorgeous they're so pigmented
just like the tiniest little swipe and
it's just pigment for days I mean it's
incredible if you want to know more
about them I will link my in-depth
review down below but overall the makeup
geek blush is launching this year these
were like one of my rider dies I use
them constantly
the next blush is I discovered this year
that I use non-stop and if you are
videos I'm sure you already know which
are the Bekaa blushes I do own every
single color that they sell which I
don't sell that many I think they have
like maybe eight or nine but I do own
all of them and I love all of them they
are so loved shuri us they are so crazy
pigmented like I can't even imagine
hitting pan on these because they're so
pigmented when I apply it like I take on
my brush and I'm like and like that's it
I'm not kidding they are so crazy thing
that's it
my three favorite colors are flower
child songbird and a wild honey and I
will show you what they look like here
they are right here this is wild honey
this is a flower child and then this is
songbird and these are my three
favorites they're all very different
from one another and they're all
absolutely gorgeous I have to mention
the Anastacio contour kit
this came out this past year and it
everybody heard about the contour kit
like it was such a hot item everybody
loved everybody wanted it it was just
such a great concept I really really
enjoyed it I have the banana shade
missing right here because I popped it
out and put it somewhere else these are
magnetic and they pop in and out which
is so awesome because now they have
every single shade which they have like
a crazy amount of shades you can see on
their website they have every single
shade sold individually in a little
magnetic pan and then you can buy this
little palette on its own and you can
customize your own highlighting and
contouring kit which is just brilliant
it's so awesome I absolutely love this
concept and the banana shade which is
right oh right here is like the best
under-eye highlighting of all time set
your concealer using a yellow color
underneath of your eye works in so many
ways there's so many different skin
tones it just really helps to brighten
that area and make it look very lifted
and alive so I have been mixing the
anastacio banana color from the contour
kit which you can also find separately
on their website and I have been mixing
that with the Mac Pro emphasize
highlighting powder it's technically
called the shaping powder but I call it
the highlighting powder I do have every
single one of these highlighting powders
I used to use them on all my clients
they have a range of them like 6 or 7 so
if you are Tanner or if you are
extremely dark they're going to have a
shade in the shading powder to really
help you with your needs so even though
this is stark white and it works for
me if you're much darker than me they
will have a color that'll do the same
thing for you that this does for me if
that makes sense and that is sold on Mac
procom actually no it's not Cosmetics
now
MAC Cosmetics and on the left side it
will say Pro products and that's where
you can find the shaping powders so now
we get to move on to eyes I'm not going
to swatch eyeshadows for you otherwise
I'd be swatching 75 colors I'm just
going to talk about specific palettes
and brands that I loved and really stuck
out to me this year first thing our
weight we don't want to start with oh
there's so many I'm around makeup
forever
artist eye shadows making forever revamp
their entire eyeshadow collection this
year which was incredible because a lot
of people complain before that their
shadows like we're kind of chunky and
kind of difficult to blend well they
revamp them nice and good and they are
in my opinion absolutely incredible now
I do have three pallets of them because
I love them that much like it's no joke
I will say they are $20 apiece which is
very expensive in my opinion for an
eyeshadow but once you get them you're
like I kind of understand why they are
very very large they're like almost the
size of a blush and they are so crazy
pigmented honestly it would take you
forever to go through a shadow even if
you had one shot of that you use every
single day it would still take you at
least a year to go through it probably a
year to even hit pan because these
shadows are so pigmented they do have
many different textures they have like a
very oily metallic texture which I'm
wearing this silver one right here on my
lid today and they have more like them
listening more smooth texture they have
very matte texture like they're just
they're actually gorgeous I do have
three full palettes because like I said
they are incredible and use very quickly
and become one of my favorite shadows
ever in the cosmetic industry so those
are the makeup forever artist shadows
the Anastacio beverly hills single
eyeshadows came out this year and the
colors are absolutely beautiful Claudia
and Anastacio did a gorgeous gorgeous
job at making these this is my palette
right here I do have all of them I took
all my favorites and put it into this
palette right here which is hello so me
it's like warm with one random pop of
blue like I love their really metallic
ones they're just so crazy metallic and
so fun to apply just dramatic I just
absolutely love them so this purple
right here which is the
let me see iridescent purple done I love
that color I have that color on my lower
lash line today and it's just one of my
favorite Purple's pepper they're not I'm
intimidating they're not so extremely
highly pigmented that you feel like you
can't work with them like some
eyeshadows can be fees I think are so
great for just the average woman who
needs shadows and they came out with
tons of basic neutral shades that
everyone can use so I really like these
for that back drumroll please the makeup
geek foiled eyeshadows oh yeah they're
so beautiful the foiled eyeshadows are
only like these right here all of these
are not the shadow they're just these
bad boys these came out at the end of
2014 and they I honestly don't even know
verse a about them just buy them they're
so gorgeous the price is so damn right
like they're just so beautiful it is out
of this world I am going to be doing a
makeup tutorial next using the foil
shadows for those of you who want to see
how they apply in all that I'm so
excited the mega Charlotte I've been
talking about if I come bump at this
point I can't wait to do it but these
foiled shadows are just I'll show you
I'm going to show you boom hello look at
this kind it's one tiny little swipe
that is flamethrower for those of you
who are curious the gorgeous burnt
orange out of this world out of this
world one of the best things that came
out in 2014 or they make a peak for
eyeshadows boom Arlena boom okay so last
for eyeshadows I'm never going to talk
about this palette on camera this year
but it's because I get so many comments
when people say and I use warm colors
too much and you stop using warm colors
and so I don't want to use sense of warm
colors on camera because a lot of people
comment that so I kind of kept this to
myself but I did want to mention it to
you guys who also love warm colors and
it is the Lime Crime Venus palette huh
when they were promoting this on
Instagram I was literally stalking them
so so scared there was gonna launch and
I wasn't gonna be able to get it was
gonna sell out I was going to be like no
but I got it it is just absolutely
beautiful
I honestly bought this palette
specifically for this color right here
which is the shade muse if I had my way
I would wear these two colors as
the eye rimmed around my eye top and
bottom all day every day that was like
my favorite look ever it she's like a
burnt dark orange e red just looped
around the whole eye with black gel
liner like that's all I wanted life
absolutely gorgeous I honestly have not
played with the shimmers only once but
the mats are beautiful this palette is
just beautiful so if you love warms this
is for you favorite eyeliner of the year
would have to be the ardency in which is
another brand I discovered this year
amazing I love their lip products I love
their eyeshadows and their eyeliners
their eyeliners are the creamiest
eyeliners I've ever use I want to swatch
it for you I have before though but I'm
not going to because honestly this will
not move it is so black it is so creamy
I use this now on my waterline and it's
like done my favorite lash glue I think
I discovered this this year I'm - Carter
asked last year I'm not totally positive
but this is the house of lashes eyelash
adhesive I used to always use the duo
waterproof one no this is the best
eyelash glue ever I love the fact that
it has a little wand did you can just
like apply like that as opposed to
squeezing and then getting too much
product and set it up and then sometimes
if like I in Russia I don't pop my lash
on all the way you can just take this
little wand and let touch on the inner
corner and then just reapply it so
easily because the fact that you have a
little wand instead of a tube so house
of lashes eyelash adhesive favorite
lashes of the year number one Ward
definitely has to go to the lower lashes
which are mink lashes they are cruelty
free which states on their website and
these just honestly were the lashes of
the year for me um I can't really pick a
specific style my favorites are whiskey
sweet nothings which are what I'm
wearing today lash in the city lash
holic and there's one more strike a pose
those are my four favorite lashes from
velour which overall the lower lashes in
general or xab salutely beautiful I love
them so much I wore them all year long
and you can wear them much 20 times so
it's like you can just keep going keep
wearing constantly these came into my
life at the end of 2014 and I seriously
just feel like we're a match made in
heaven these are my favorite lashes I
think of all time and these are the Lena
lashes in the style Bianca
if you watch my videos you've seen to
use these quite a few times because I
cannot get over them I want to wear them
every single day they are so voluminous
and thick and fluffy but at the same
time they're not too overboard they're
not too long they're not too intense
it's not like damn girl calm down their
lashes it's just like the perfect amount
of lashes to make you feel sexy and
OnPoint and smoky without being too much
they're just absolutely gorgeous so
again that is the style of Bianca by
Lena lashes oh I miss these two random
products but I have to talk about the
MAC Cosmetics press pigments I use these
like crazy this year especially in the
summer time I could not stop using light
touch and vanilla diamond devily but I
think vanilla diamond was
limited-edition and of course Mac of
course but just the pressed pigments in
general I think that they can take any
makeup look and just give it that fun
glamour girly factor I just absolutely
love them I own tons of them I will take
a little bit of that two-faced glitter
glue tap it on my lid take this just
press it on with my fingers and boom
these are the NARS dual intensity
eyeshadows this is in the shade Hema
Leia and then this one isn't a shade do
knee I have talked about these before I
love them both they are super similar in
color this one's just a little bit
darker and a little bit warmer than do
knee is just a malaya they're just
gorgeous they're very metallic I will
swatch one for you you can see right
there the metallic that it has in it
it's just so so so pretty is there
gorgeous for smokey eye that's how I'll
wear them
I'll put it all over the lid and for
like a super dark brown and black in the
crease and it's just gorgeous so dual
intense into eyeshadows by NARS we're
moving on to lip products almost
overwhelming oh my god okay so the first
thing is a lip liner this is the only
lip liner I have from the year 2014 that
I felt like was really worth mentioning
because it is just amazing and this is
in the shade el agua this is the evelle
vut lip liner NARS did their redid their
lip liners in the year 2014 and they are
so creamy they remind me very much of
mac prolongwear lip liners which are my
favorite lip liners in all the industry
they're gorgeous
and this is right there next to it but
the shade el agua is just my favorite
color ever I'm wearing
it right now with some products on top
it'll talk about a second but it is my
favorite color ever it is just like this
beautiful kind of light pinky purpley
and some people it's going to be more of
a nude it is just so so gorgeous
they also redid their lipsticks they
came out the NARS audacious abscissa
seer and my favorite lipstick is in the
shade Anna which I have talked about but
I cannot find it anywhere it's been lost
for two weeks and I'm so depressed
without it that lipstick is amazing but
I don't have it to show you guys but
that is one of my favorites so on top of
el agua lip liner I do have the Jerrod
cosmetics a buttercup lipstick which is
one of my creations I day within this
year 2014 was an amazing year for me
personally being able to team up with
gerard cosmetics and come out with my
four little babies it was such an
amazing opportunity i'm so so grateful
for that and this right here is my
favorite thing that I created with them
is the Buttercup weight right I was like
wait this is called buttercup right the
Buttercup lipstick I also did 1995 Rose
Hill and butter cream lip gloss but
buttercup lipstick was my favorite thing
that I did with them I just actually
love this I use it all the time I feel
like any time I ever want to do a nude
pinky lip this is all I use now I just
absolutely love it I'm not just saying
that cuz I created it I really do love
it and then last but not least on my
lips I have the Gerard cosmetics shimmer
of Hope lip gloss which is a beautiful
beautiful nudie just new perfect like
with a little bit of baby pink lip gloss
in it it's just absolutely gorgeous I do
have that on top so I have these three
right here el agua buttercup and then
shimmer of hope this is like my favorite
lip combination at the moment for a
neutral kind of pinky lip I absolutely
love it I do have crazy awesome discount
codes for you guys right now for drug
cosmetics products I'll put them in the
bottom bar because they're not lasting
for too too long so all this those down
below also I have to mention the other
products that I created with them which
is the butter cream lip gloss I I really
really love this gloss it is just such a
pretty feminine dainty pinky color and
their lip glosses are honestly they feel
more like liquid lipsticks to me even
though they don't
Matt or anything they're so crazy
pigmented that it's just it's very
pigmented and they feel they last so
long and they feel more like lipstick on
my lips and a gloss because they're just
so thick but I love that and gloss these
are the Smashbox be legendary long
wearing lip lacquers and this is the
shade rosewater and this is the shade
keepsake rose water is more of like a
nudey pink and keepsake is like a lilac
kind of purpley pink I love keepsake I
think it's so beautiful and so different
and it matches the NARS el agua lip
liner beautifully they go on kinda like
a lip gloss I really like this really
big kind of spacious applicator that it
comes with it covers the lips so quick
and nice and easily and I just love that
they stay on longer than normal lip
gloss yet they don't feel disgusting on
your lip - no I'm saying you're not like
oh god like get this off like they feel
very nice on the lips and they do last
longer than a typical box I have quite a
few colors in them and I love them all
this is quite a pricey item right here
but I had to mention it because in case
you're in the mood for giving up an arm
and a leg for a lipstick I would
recommend this one this is the Tom Ford
lipstick this is the lip color Rouge in
the shade 12 nude vanilla this remind me
very much of Mac myth but just a little
bit more pink in it it is very very nude
but I really got into super nude lips
this year I absolutely love it these
tomforde lipsticks they are so insanely
expensive oh my gosh that's why I don't
have tons of them but I will say that
once you put it on you're like okay
great
I want them all because they really just
wear so beautifully it doesn't give you
like that gross inner rim line that you
get from lipstick that we all hate it is
just so smooth so pigmented so creamy so
buttery silent areas you get the drill I
fell in love with OCC lip tar this year
like it was our year for true bonding my
two favorites which I'm talking about
all the nudes just because I feel like
news are so Universal like who does a
lot of good new have a lot of like
raspberries and reds that I love him as
well but my two favorite neutral colors
I just could not stop wearing was hush
and interlace I have loved hush for
about two years this year I went
with it and that's the thing was even
using it all the time look it's like
nothing no dent has even been made it's
still full to the brim like these things
will last you they're going to go rotten
before you actually use them all and
this one is interlaced which is a very
very nude kind of beige light paint just
a touch of paint but very nude overall
I've used this in a couple of tutorials
I've used both of them in a couple
tutorials I just love them and they have
a really nice pepperminty feel on the
lips and they taste so yummy I don't
know if I mentioned this last year
because I think I discovered this I
don't know if it was the beginning of
this year or if it was last year that I
really like fell in love with these but
this is the Maybelline Color elixir and
this specific shade is in Lux in lilac
but it doesn't really matter what shade
it is I have probably eight of these and
I just love them all
they are very moisturizing they almost
feel just like a moisturizer and not
even a lip color in general there's so
more stir eyes on the lips and they have
a beautiful kind of sheer color payoff
it's not overboard because even though
it's like this is so pigmented and so
creamy you'll need one swipe there are
moments where you're like but I don't
want it to be that pigmented I don't
want to do that creamy I want to lip
gloss it's more on the sheer side you
know what I'm saying like we all have
different days and different tastes so
this is really beautiful The Price is
Right of course it's Maybelline so love
that and that is the maybelline color
elixir yes color that's okay bring it in
for the real thing let's talk about bite
Beauty this year I really fell in love
with the brand bite Beauty in general
all their lips are incredible and I love
it back they're natural and they're
organic and that's why it's called bite
Beauty because you can bite it you can
eat it organic natural yeah no okay then
I just have one gloss here because I
don't really have like a specific shade
that's like my favorite this is a lip
gloss peach which makes no sense because
the baby pink and they call the peach
and alls it with somebody confused in
the warehouse when labeling this button
they're the plazas in general are just
absolute gorgeous they're just the
perfect law so you're understanding
they're not too heavy they're not too
sheer they're just gorgeous there are
perfect lip wash to throw over a
lipstick and you're good to go
so this is bite beauty and these are the
lush fruit lip glosses and they smell so
delicious like fruits I love them so
my beauty in general gets like an
a-plus-plus from me for the year 2014
and then another brand that I discovered
this year and I really enjoyed was the
girl lactic Beauty I don't know if they
have a store I know that they are sold
online though that's where I always
direct you guys is online this glass
though and called baby doll was my
favorite gloss by them I just absolutely
loved it they do have lip stains which
are gorgeous and they have some
beautiful shade like beautiful ma vie
rosy shades but just the brand in
general I use their eyeshadows this year
I use our lip glosses this year their
bronzer their highlighter everything I
use by them I have not been disappointed
there's a great brand and I really hope
in the year of 2015 they start to expand
more and more and more because it's
definitely an understated brand and
deserves much more attention than
they're getting so that is girl lactic
Beauty to last lip products I use this
one like crazy this year and this is the
buxom true nude lip foundation in the
shade buff they did come out I believe
five or six of these so like all skin
tones they have like the lightest to
darkest to kind of match your skin your
lips and your needs this is the lightest
one of the shade buff because you know
up a little white girl but it is just
very very pigmented and very nude so I
will put this all over my lips and then
go in with a gloss to kind of make it
pop I will also use this and just kind
of put it in just the center of my lips
to make them pop a little bit make them
look a little bit fuller just you know a
little tricks here and there but I just
love this love this you can use this
just as a basic everyday lipstick and
it'll work it is matte and it is very
highly pigmented last lip color my gosh
like I can't breathe I'm sorry breath
this is the Mac mineralized lip gloss in
the shade be nice be nice I got this at
the very beginning of the year when it
first came out and it's just a beautiful
coral color I have had a few people
literally buy this off my lips okay it
sound like I said bite and that is not
happening I do not live in the world of
vampires buy this off my lips quieter
times I've been shopping and some will
walk up to me and be like what color is
on your lips and I'll be like how would
this look I'm going and getting it right
now because it is just seriously so
pretty especially in the spring and
summer if you have like a little bit of
that summer glow going on oh I love a
coral lip gloss with a slight tan or a
very dark tan just any sort of tan at
all in general I think it is just
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
it's a beautiful lip gloss it's a little
more on the sheer side but it has the
perfect amount of pigment that you need
to really show up it is beautiful I love
love the Mac mineralize lip glosses so
be nice
alright so that completes my best of
beauty for the year 2014
