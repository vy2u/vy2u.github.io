today's that is not what you think it is
my dog is snoring right now okay that's
my story and I'm sticking to it
my Christmas trees are still up yes I
know I'm never ready to let go of the
spirit of Christmas I know there's some
people like my sister she could not wait
to get her tree down she's just like oh
my god I need my house to be back to
normal I've gotta get rid of the
Christmas decorations I'm just like say
it Georgina I love you but you have got
to stop making it sound like mommy is
farting and it's not a good look for my
channel I tried really hard you guys to
narrow down my products to just like my
absolute love's love's of 2017 the way I
always do this video everyone has their
own rules of course of their own channel
but the way I always do this video is I
pick out my most used most favorite
parts of the entire year some of these
products did launch in 2017 and some of
these products might just might have
launched in 2009 these are the products
that I found myself using over and over
and over throughout the year and I just
loved it so much so let's get started
as always I'm going to talk about things
kind of in the order that you apply them
to the face we're gonna start with
primers and foundations and concealers
and powders and you catch my drift for
the year of 2017 I only have one primer
to talk about every since am I talking
about this it pains me it does it
physically pains me a little bit to talk
about it because yes it is the price of
a car payment but you guys I'm not
kidding this was not just the best
primer 2017 this is the best I have ever
ever ever ever used
I really can't justify the price on this
though honestly but I will say that the
way it makes my foundation look where
and last is unlike any other it is
absolutely beautiful so I crown thee the
greatest primer of all time I'm gonna
start off with the most obvious
concealer first and this is the Tarte
shape tape and I'm sure this is an every
single person's videos for the year
round up a best conceal
because seriously I have to say just
like the primer this is not only the
best concealer of 2017 I think this is
the best concealer I've ever tried to
exist on the market to this day I don't
see how anything could get better than
this
I have tried so many concealers in my
lifetime and I've loved so many of them
but this is just like ridiculous before
this I used to love the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer and now when I go
back and use that one from time to time
I still like it but I'm just like oh my
god I had no idea how good a concealer
could actually be until tart shape tape
it's super full coverage seal in a way
that you wouldn't like it is you don't
like full coverage concealer you can
still blend out of course and she's like
a tiny dot but it is a full coverage
concealer and when it dries it dries to
like a kind of like semi matte so it's
not like a chalkboard matte but it's not
dewy and it's not sticky when it says
some is a spooky
it's not spooky when it says so second
concealer I tried this year that was
actually extremely impressed by and it's
very inexpensive is the new color pop no
filter concealer I actually tried
swearing very first time on camera and
then I use it I would say probably five
six times off-camera now the reason I
use it more as because I can't help it I
always end up going back to this because
it is just the best concealer ever but I
will say that this one is absolutely
beautiful so I wanted to mention it
because it did come out this year and I
didn't really enjoy it so if you're a
girl or a boy on a budget and you're
just like uh want the Tarte shaped tips
so bad but I can't afford it this one is
really really beautiful and it's a
fraction of the costs for foundations I
only have one foundation for the entire
year to talk about which is crazy I
could obviously talk about several
foundations there were a lot of
foundations I use this year and I really
liked but this was just like the bee's
knees one of the best foundations I've
ever used in my entire life even when I
use another foundation I still mix it
with this one it is the Dior forever
fluid foundation oh my gosh I've never
used a foundation that has made me look
so poreless and airbrushed in my entire
life so back in the spring when I first
started wearing this foundation I went
to music park here in Tampa has called
Busch Gardens and I went there with my
entire family for the day and it was the
first time that my family had seen me
like out in the sunlight like in the
light of day where you can't hide
anything while wearing this foundation
and I could not believe how much my own
family would not stop staring at my skin
would
stop complimenting me they're like what
are you doing my stairs like did you
change your skincare and I'm like no
this is just the foundation like you see
me every day like I was so shocked by
how beautiful my makeup and my skin
looked out in the actual like natural
daylight because girl you know that
that's like a hard test to pass like
when you're out in the Sun all day long
and you look in the mirror you're like
oh no but my makeup still looked perfect
to begin to this foundation let's talk
about powder so this year I really
wanted to find like the perfect powder
so I tried a ton of them this year and
these are my top ones that I use all the
time so the first one is this Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush flawless finish skin
perfecting micro powder oh it's a lot
this is a brand new compact that I just
bought because I am officially 100% out
of mine I'd go back and forth between
the shades one and two and what I love
about this powder is that it really does
make your skin look airbrushed but on
top of it it's just sheer enough where
it doesn't give too much extra coverage
but it looks so natural on the scale
it's like natural and kind of buttery
and kind of satiny but there's no
sparkle there's no shimmer and it's not
gonna make you look oily it's just not
gonna make you look completely fully max
if that makes sense it's just a really
beautiful natural powder next I have the
cover of X perfect setting powder and I
love saying that name every single time
so I feel like whoever nameless they're
just like just get some point all right
it's the perfect setting powder so this
is technically a translucent powder but
even though it's translucent like it has
color in there it is not completely like
a white out translucent powder I use
this just strictly as a translucent
powder I use it underneath my eye I used
to contour my nose and just contour my
cheeks and it is just so beautiful but
my favorite part about this powder
hands-down is that it definitely has
like a kind of like a moisturizing
creamy feel it doesn't feel like that
dry ass just like chalk transit scent
powder
so that's really what drew this I mean
drew it to me drew me to it that's why I
use it okay last powder and I'm pretty
sure talking about this powder in last
year's video maybe but I talked about it
in a different shade but this
I just introduced this powder back into
my routine at the end of 2017 and it was
one of those moments where I was like
why did I ever stop this in the first
place like I love those moments but I
also hate those moments so my chocolate
get it together I'd be better than this
like why did you ever lock this up like
this should be on my vanity at all times
this is a must in my routine it is by
Lancome uncle so this is called the
absolute powder and it says it is a
radiant smoothing powder it's gonna
smooth the skin don't like it's gonna
smooth so this isn't the shade absolute
pitch I don't know I don't know if you
are dry to normal skin and you're just
looking for that all-over glow effect
when I say glow I'm not talking about
like a beaming highlight but I'm just
talking about a glow if the glow that I
have on my face right now like I don't
look matte but I don't look like boom
highlighted everywhere this is the
powder for you it is so beautiful I
apply this with a damp Beauty sponge I
just take it and I dip it right in there
and then I just Pat it all over my
entire face this powder does have a
little bit of shimmer in it which is so
weird for me to say oh yeah I take this
power to has shimmer in it put it all
over your face but it's not shimmer it's
not glitter and press it into the skin
it just makes you look so fresh and
alive and just radiant it's like a glow
from within all over your face it just
makes everything like let's move on to
bronzers I have three bronzers that I
fell in love with this year the first
one is the most expensive one and this
is by a little Amer I talked about this
in my favorites video and it's one of
those one of those products that I'm
just like it has a very very strong
scent every since I might open it up I'm
like which time to bronze so right here
there is a strip that has like a
highlighting shimmer something I've
never even used this like I've never
touched it I always avoid that little
strip with my brush which is really easy
because it's so tiny and the pan is very
large so I always like swirl my brush
over in this region right here it is
such a smooth bronzer a little bit goes
a long way it's very pigmented it's very
creamy it's not a she I just love the
undertone in it but keep in mind I do
prefer a more like terracotta orangie
undertone if you will just funny that I
say that because this is so much more
Brown but this is the Marc Jacobs what
is this even called the tantastic Omega
bronzer this is the limited edition one
that came out this year with their
coconut collection and it looks like a
nice it is a huge pan and this is one of
my favorite bronzers that I did use this
year also just the regular standard
always available on Omega bronzer by
Marc Jacobs it's in the same packaging
but black and it's a little bit of a
different shade I love that rod so I
went back and forth between both of
these all year I love them both pretty
much equally but this is the one that I
have right now and I don't really know
where the other one OHS thing that I
love about the Marc Jacobs bronzers and
I feel like it's very hard to mess it up
it's very hard to be like really
heavy-handed and take it too far like
they're nice and sheer and buildable and
they look very natural on the skin which
is funny because when I first tried that
bronzer I hated it I was like oh this is
crap and then Manny told me he's like no
bitch it's amazing like what's wrong
with you it's always like let me try it
again and that's it that's my story then
the third bronzer that I have and this
is actually a brand new one because I
was getting super low on it because
believe it or not this is one of my
favorite bronzers especially for when I
am not really tan and this is the butter
bronzer by Physicians Formula so you can
find this at the drugstore much cheaper
alternative to both of those and it
smells so good it smells like vacation
just like coconuts
ah so good doesn't come in that many
shades I believe though at least not
when I saw them when I was the drugstore
there was only like three or four shades
available and they weren't really like a
lot of dark ones so I can't use this
bronzer if I have like a good tan I can
only use it when I'm fairly light and
don't have a spray tan going on but it
really is so beautiful just the name of
that butter bronzer I mean immediately I
was attracted to it and it is so buttery
nice and beautiful it's a little on the
sheer side but in a good way because
it's so creamy and it just goes under
the skin just like butter okay so now
let's talk about highlighters of course
my favorite part and I actually did a
really good job narrowing it down
because I only have one two three four
five six which is really good for me I
the entire year are you kidding I'm
impressed
sell 5% I'm gonna start with my number
one favorite of all 2017 I use I would
say the most actually no I have to their
time but this is the makeup forever
starlet powder in the shade number 13
this is technically not a cheek
highlight I believe they met for to be
eyeshadow but Oh Jorgie nose it became a
highlight real quick though when people
started discovering like the
highlighting powder be highlighting
power behind it you can see right here
how intensely sure Maria is and that has
a tiny tiny amount that I applied to my
hand it is so just like beaming it is
absolutely ridiculous but it's smooth it
doesn't go on chunky and I feel like in
the year of 2017 I was on the hunt for
non chunky highlights because I feel
like so many highlights have come out in
the industry that it's so oversaturated
now and it's so hard like to pick up the
good ones from the okay one two the crap
one sometimes so for me what makes a
highlighter good is I want it to look
smooth on the skin number one and I want
it to blind people number two okay it's
not too much to ask second in line which
is very similar to the makeup forever
starlet powder is the Kylie cosmetics
what are these even technically called
okay they're just called loose pigments
right it doesn't say on here but you can
see the bottom of mine it's so beaten up
I absolutely loved these highlights this
year so the two shades I wore all the
time are Santorini and Fiji and
Santorini is the palest shade and Fiji
has a little bit more color to it but
this is very similar to the makeup for
everyone except you get more product in
this one and it is a cheaper price so I
would say it's a really really great do
like they're extremely similar so this
is the kylie one right here and this
isn't make it forever number 13 I might
be crazy I think that the makeup for
ever one is a little bit smoother on the
skin but that could just be me creating
stuff up in my head but I do think it's
a little bit smoother than the Kylie one
but I use them both all the time and I
think they're the best highlights of
2017 speaking of Kylie I did wear these
a lot and this is in the shade french
vanilla and this is in the shade cotton
candy cream what I actually like about
these is the fact they are not so
intense that when you highlight
damn like you really do have to build it
up but I appreciate that because there
are days where I don't want to have a
blinding highlight I know you guys are
probably not subscribe oh don't leave me
and speaking of sheer highlights this
has been in my life now for way too long
um the mirror is gone and I still just
keep going you would think that could
buy myself a new one this is actually
the highlight the exact one I licked
when I was doing truth or dare with
Manny and Laura I just realized that and
I never replaced it so this product does
come in many different shades but I just
personally think that this is the
prettiest one with the prettiest
highlighting effect and if you're really
really fair you can actually use it as a
blush which is really beautiful it is in
the shade of luminous light and it is
hands-down the most universal beautiful
looking highlight because it's not going
to be intense like the first view it's
way more subtle it's way more sheer but
this is like a head that you can kind of
lightly dust all over the place and it
just makes you glow this is the secret
to a bridal beauty glow it is so
gorgeous and it seriously looks like you
have a light bulb within yourself and
you're just beaming in a very natural
subtle but beautiful way this is a
product that came out towards the end of
2017 I just recently started using it
and this is what is actually on my face
today for highlight and it is the Wet n
Wild mega Glo highlighting palette we
tell you right now there's only two
shades in here that I genuinely love the
other two I don't like this one right
here it is so glittery and not not good
I do not like it this one up here is
very like bluish and just yeah like I
don't know it's like I would only wear
that if it was like a look you know if I
was doing like blue eye shadow I want to
have like that Space Jam moment but
otherwise these two shades right here
are the only ones that I actually use so
this one down here it looks like it's
green but it actually has more like a
golden undertone to it more than
anything once you apply it to the skin
and a little bit like a big yellow Goldy
not green it doesn't look like cash
money bitches on your face like it's not
green but this one right here is the one
that I'm wearing today you can see it on
my face it's got that really beautiful
pinky kind of I see pinky vanilla
undertone it's right here on my hand
that's going
hard to see I want them to come out with
more palettes and more shades because I
don't love the shade range but I'm
obsessed with this top color right here
and I think that this top color is worth
the price of the entire palette and this
is the last highlighting product that I
have right here and this is by the brand
iconic of London and it is a liquid
illuminator and it is unlike anything
they can use all over the skin like
before you go with your foundation to
really give yourself that like oomph
glow I mix it in with my foundation a
lot in 2017 but the way that I wore it
the most is just to highlight all over
the cheekbones and I will use a damp
Beauty sponge sponge a damp duty sponge
I would type it all over my cheekbones
and then I would go in with my powders
and my highlights like normal and all
that jazz and it would just give like
that inner boom let me show you what the
tiniest drop will do one of this you see
that it's just right it's so right let's
talk about do you hear my Alexa like
that little um my friends Mike and PK
got me I was like shut up I said no one
cares
they got me one of those like little
iGoogle home thing that this little
speaker and you can like talk to Alexa
and she just starts babbling about
random shit all the time I'm like kid
can you not obviously the first
eyeshadow palette I'm gonna talk about
is this guy right here the palette that
I created with morphe this palette
launching in June was the highest point
of my year as far as my career goes not
only do I finally get to launch
something that I have been hiding for so
long from all of social media and biting
my tongue over getting to see all of
your excitement and all the joy on top
of it I also got to take my entire
family out to LA to celebrate the launch
of this palette I got to meet my family
for four days straight and that was such
an amazing thing so I'm so thankful for
this palette I'm so thankful for that
hype that you guys continuously give
this palette you guys have made it's so
ridiculously successful Linda and I both
never in a million years would have
dreamt the kind of success that we have
gotten from this it's because you guys
have shown this so much love and hype
all over social media and it's it's all
because of you so thank you so much for
just all the love I came and begin to
yeah
so proud of and so thankful ah such a
high point of my ear okay but for real
though I'm gonna top of the actual
palate and why I love it so much and why
it genuinely is one of my favorites I'm
gonna try to remove myself from this
palette and accent I didn't create it
and tell you why I actually genuinely
use this palette every single time I did
my makeup I am able to create whatever
look I want with this palette I have two
different highlight shades I can also
use on my cheekbones I have this
beautiful range if I do things on myself
of all these neutral transition shades
but they all have different undertones
and then for all different skin tones
and all different eye colors and
whatever look you're going for we have
all these beautiful warm orange and red
job you see are a huge trend they have
them for a while now and then of course
all the dark Browns as well I have all
different undertones it's also basically
half matte half shimmer so you got an
equal divide depending if your a
shimmery girl or if you're more math
girl you can do either look and you've
got your pops of colors in here so this
palette to me is everything that I need
it is genuinely one of the only palettes
I use the entire year I'll show you guys
the other two cos I think are amazing
but overall that was it
the second palette that I was so
impressed by this year was the Sephora
pro palette and not as much the warm
palette and definitely not that like
kind of weird cool tone mix of shades I
don't know what that was but I didn't
like it um but this one right here is
the editorial palette so this one is all
the little all the pops of color oh my
god just in general if you are someone
who likes color I don't see how you
cannot get this palette because I have
never seen such pigmented in tense matte
shades like these are gorgeous this is
just like one swipe do you see this it's
absolutely insane how pigments these are
the only downfall to this palette is it
does have a lot of Fallout all doesn't
really bother me too much though because
I know what I'm gonna get so I prepare
and I prepped by putting transit powder
underneath my eyes or doing my
foundation last and doing my eyes first
but if you are someone who just like
hates fallout just be aware that that
palette does have it but you're gonna
get a badass amazing extremely pigmented
outcome even though you have fallout for
the last I shadow palette that I have I
really tried hard not to annoy you guys
because I know
it really frustrates me when I over talk
about morphe because they think that I'm
sponsored or because I want to get paid
or whatever it may be and I wanted to
prove to you guys that that's not the
case so I tried very hard not to put too
many morphe products in this video even
though I love morphe and not only do I
love the brand morphe but I love the
people behind the brand but I would have
loved to put several morphe palettes
that I use this year but I decided not
to instead I kept it down to just one
besides mine and it would have to be the
more feet dare to create 39a palette
which was their holiday their holiday
collection
I think this palette is so unique and so
beautiful this is a brand new guy or
right here this one was actually one
that was supposed to go into my 12 days
of Christmas giveaway and my sister
didn't know and she opened it up and she
swatched won so I was like okay I gotta
get a new one I'm just obsessed for this
no row right here with these full-size
pans of all these transition colors this
palette is super super creamy I
personally feel like morphic keeps
getting better and better and better
their shadows keep everything that
they're launching keeps improving and
keeps getting better I think this is one
of the best palettes in the entire year
for sure because the fact you get such a
range of neutrals and colors and mattes
and shimmers and Vivid's it's a
beautiful palette and it's like so bossy
and big so that's the one I chose for
more feet so the last I shadow product
that I have are the Stila magnificent
metals I no longer even really use loose
glitter
honestly like I think I use loose
glitter once this entire year like I
never even grabbed it I always go for
the steal of magnificent metals now they
are so beautiful and this color came out
this year and I immediately just was so
drawn to it it's called next to note
look how beautiful with one swipe this
gorgeous cranberry kind of rusty red oh
my god they also came out in these
definitely came out in 2017 with the
shimmer and glow liquid eyeshadows and
this is in the shade La Douce sounds
like ladouche but look how beautiful
this color is right here this greeny oh
my god it's so good I have been so in to
all of these like I have every single
color well they've also sent me every
single color but there are a few colors
that came out and they didn't sit like
send them to me it's like two months so
I bought them immediately oh the guy I'm
knocking away for the P are back
I need them now and I am obsessed like I
said I no longer even reach for glitters
because this just makes it so easy you
just paint on your I let it dry kind of
blend it out and you're done
it's like foolproof and I'm um cest
hands found my favorite lash of all 2017
is the flutter intoxicating lash right
here it is what I'm wearing on my eyes
today I purchased 100 pairs of them this
year because I was like enough is enough
I'm sick of only buying 5 6 7 pairs at a
time and running out so now mama is
stocked for another only two weeks
they're very dramatic as you can see
they are not in natural lash but I think
they're still fluffy and pretty and
girly while being like Vavoom but not
too much I love them Alexa no enough so
we have finally entered the beautiful
world of a lip product so the way I want
to do this is I want to kind of go in
like categories so first I want to talk
about my go-to bold lips that I wore in
2017 I wore these three colors like
crazy and I get asked questions about
every single one of them every time I
wear them so if I would just tell you
all three of them right now the first
one for sure is the Kylie cosmetics
Kristen liquid lipstick it is this
beautiful like I don't even know how to
actually describe this color but it's
probably my favorite color of the entire
year
it looks like that right there it's like
this beautiful berry red but it's not
God it's not red that's not the right
word it's not red it's not pink it's not
raspberry it's just it's beautiful I
wore it so much that I went completely
through the entire bottle that's the
first time I've ever gone through an
entire bottle of liquid lipstick in my
entire life like have you ever gone
through an entire model like it's empty
like I did that to mine and it was sold
out and I was so pissed so I didn't have
it's like three or four weeks at first
of all problems like I want my Lichtman
Lance Mac so I was just able to reorder
it in like November I think it was so
Kristin is back in my life such a good
lip color snap get a bold lip for sure
was the color pop and Alexis RN
collaboration in the shade little weapon
right yeah little weapon this is such a
unique color I also purchase a new one
of this as well it's so unique because
it's not really red or pink it's
somewhere
between but it is like fire it is just
like a show-stopping attention calling
lip color it is gorgeous and then my
last one that I wore like crazy and I
start wearing this in the summertime was
hot shot by morphe it is a beautiful
like straight orange II red liquid lip
and you can see I don't the camera will
show you but it's very different two
little weapon a little weapon definitely
has much more of a berry undertone in it
I don't know if you can see you can't
really see on camera that well but Hot
Shot is definitely like an orange e
orange --red we're a little weapon it
had definitely has like more like a
pinky a raspberry to it but these are my
three bold lips that I wore all year
long okay so I want to talk about my
favorite liquid lipstick formulas in
general of the entire year so the first
one is the always on Smashbox liquid
lipstick this actually came out in 2016
but I continued my love affair with it
throughout all of 2017 I think it is one
of the most beautiful liquid lipstick
formulas ever ever ever I love the
applicator for it it's got that nice
little pointy doe foot applicator so
it's really easy to get nice and light
every single crack and crevice it's a
little messy but not too moosie it's not
too thick it's not too sheer it is
beautiful it lasts so long it doesn't
bleed it doesn't fade it is just like
it's the dream liquid lipstick all three
of these are honestly but they're all
very different at the same time next
which is the most high-end one is the
YSL liquid lipstick and this just
recently launched it was towards the end
of 2017 I actually tried it for the
first time on camera and I have not
stopped wearing these liquid lipsticks
ever since what makes it so unique is
the fact that if you wear it and you
kiss the back of your hand it will come
off a little bit like it's not so dry
that it's not gonna move whatsoever
but it's got just enough moisture in it
to keep your lips looking plump and
hydrated all night long but I swear to
god you guys and this stuff does not
move it is like voodoo it is freaky how
it works like I will go out I will eat I
will have drinks I will do whatever I'll
spend a night out on the town and it's
been five hours it's still exactly the
same
has not moved it is so weird it's
amazing it is such a good formula I just
wanted to come out with more news
because they have so many brights I
don't like okay that's great but like I
want like 15 neutrals hmm thanks myself
and then my last favorite liquid
lipstick formula of 2017 is definitely
color pop color pop had a great year
they came out with so many products they
came up with some products that I was
not so crazy about but they come out
with a lot of products that I really
just genuinely loved and their price
point is just so right color pop has so
many good nudes I can't even begin
I could make an entire video just on
like my top 10 nudes from color pop and
their liquid lipsticks because they have
so many and is outrageous which I
absolutely love it's a really really
beautiful formula it's not overly drying
it's not overly moisturizing it doesn't
come off and it lasts just like any good
liquid lipstick would it's not gonna
last you for like eight to ten hours
it's gonna wear off like a normal liquid
lipstick but it's just so good and for
the price point it's absolutely bombed
and then last for lips we have glosses
so it's really hard for me to say my
number one favorite loss but I'm gonna
be honest you guys I actually think it's
Kylie cosmetics I know I've been talking
about this gloss for like a year and a
half now at this point the only thing is
after you had them for a long time they
do start to get kind of like chunky and
the tube and just kind of like gloppy
and goopy but I think that's just their
way of saying like it's time to buy a
new one like enough is enough it's been
a year like time to replace the gloss
maybe but these glosses are so beautiful
and I love her range of nudes if you're
looking for her nudists like Kayla's
prettiest gloss I don't like prettiest
like I love it because it's so nude and
I love a good nude lip it is the shade
so cute it's not mommy it's just like a
perfect beautiful nude looks like that
right there it's a good gloss next in
line is the bare minerals of gloss this
is such a beautiful formula but I will
say I actually like the kind of cosmetic
formula better this one starts to kind
of break up and separate and get goopy
on the lips faster than the Kylie does
this is one of my favorites right here
it's in the shade groovy it's always
sold out it's kind of hard to find but
it is so pretty I'll show you on Kylie
cosmetics so cute next to us you can see
the difference in
the shades there's similar Kai's looks a
little bit more Brown it's right a
little bit more pink in it so depending
if you wanted a more kinky one you PI
like this but the formula
I do like Kylie's butter I believe Too
Faced came out with melted latex in 2017
I'm pretty sure it wasn't 2016 but this
is a beautiful formula when I first
tried this I was shocked if you will
this is like so different and so
beautiful it is so freaking it's this
one right here it is so pigmented it
looks so hard to find a gloss that is
like so pigmented and so glossy with not
crazy sticky and not goopy you know like
it's so good I want them to come off
more shades of this to like can everyone
please just come out with like 30 nudes
that would be great the Dior Maximizer
the gloss it is definitely gonna cost
you a pretty penny but it is so
beautiful this is actually not the shade
that I use all the time my favorite
shade is just zero zero one it's pretty
much completely clear makes the lips
nice and plump and it just makes them so
glossy is when the glossiest glosses
I've ever seen your lips just look like
they're drenched just soaking wet and I
love that look
I wear it over top of everything
basically like hmm around lipstick or
even if I put on a gloss and I love that
gloss I want to look glossy err I'll
take just a little bit of the drawer and
just a pinch cuz it's just so wet and
just like hmm
looking last gloss I have is from
L'Oreal and this is the infallible
8-hour probe loss this is the only shade
that I actually continuously wear and
I'm pretty sure I talked about it in a
favorites video it's number 105 petal
and in the actual tube it looks like my
nightmare I'm gonna be honest and the
tube I'm like oh my god this is so
frosty it looks like it has like crazy
pinky gold frosty like it doesn't look
anything be flattering but on the lips
you can barely even see it right here it
is so sheer and so shiny and beautiful
and it just gives you this layer of just
like glossy shimmer all on the lips but
it doesn't look tacky it looks gorgeous
this is a really really beautiful gloss
it feels very high-end the lips last two
things just miscellaneous items the
first one is the Aleli be a glow face
miss this basically is a dupe for the
tatcha luminous
skin mess it's gonna make you very glowy
and very dewy and it is beautiful I'll
take this actually more than anything
I'm not gonna do it now except jewelry
on um I don't want to get like oil all
over it but I will spray this on my
chest like if I'm wearing a tank top
I'll just spray this on my shoulder
spray it on my chest and I'll highlight
and it'll just keep my chest my
shoulders like being just radiating it's
really beautiful in my drunk tutorial on
the iPhone with Jackie we use this so
much we use like half the bottle just in
that tutorial so you can go see over
there how dewy and glowy it made me like
it literally makes you look like
Victoria's Secret type glow like sweaty
glow like glow last but not least I have
to mention this when's for me the best
makeup setting spray the entire year
it is the morphe preppin set so you can
also use this to prep for your makeup as
well but i always use it to set my
makeup cuz I always have I have my own
like intense ritual for prepping my face
for makeup so this is always where I use
to set and it is absolutely amazing and
like I've said the whole time the best
thing about it is the aerosol can so the
fact that it comes like a hairspray it's
like you get an even face mist every
single time you never have to worry
about pushing down and you're facing
this like spinning at you and ruining
your makeup or did you make a direct
shot to the face like this is just so
beautiful and like airy with the mist
and it's it's bomb you guys
it is bona reminds me a lot of fix+ but
it's not as sticky as fix+ like you
don't feel it on your skin once it dries
like you do with fix+ but it's so that
is it for my entire round up best of
