a makeup tutorial on this look that I'm
wearing right here I don't really
consider this eye makeup tutorial or
this an actual look it is very easy
peasy a very basic and anyone can do
this I've had a lot of requests recently
for a makeup look that is just going to
apply to the average woman maybe you
don't have time to get ready in the
morning or you don't want to make time
to get ready in the morning I get it or
you just want like me to go drop off
your kid to school or pick up your kids
from school or you stop them working out
I need to run to the grocery store this
is literally make it look that you could
do in your car at the parking lot
requires no makeup brushes just a few
products and literally five minutes of
your time it's so simple it's gonna work
for everybody
everybody can do this everybody can
achieve this it's very mindless and it's
just gonna make you look a little bit
more fresh alive and ready for the day
so yeah I hope that you guys enjoy this
tutorial I love you guys thanks for
watching and I'll see you soon bye
hey guys so I'm going to be doing it the
world's fastest makeup look today I
don't know if you didn't even consider
it a makeup look but if you have five
minutes then you can do this so let's
get going so first thing I'm gonna use
is the Garnier skin renew anti dark
circle roller this is I think I got at
Target I absolutely love this I think
it's a very underrated product I don't
really care my people talked about it
and I just think it's great and I'm
going to just be using this in areas
that I need I'm gonna put a little bit
of it right here under my eyes oh that
cannot be done and then with my finger
because we don't talk of makeup brushes
right now with my finger I'm just going
to dab that in this area but I am still
going to just lightly bring it down in a
V motion like I typically would with
concealer so eyes go from the inner
corner of the eye down into a V and then
I just Pat up towards the outer corner I
never really like take concealer and
just go like this only in that area
because especially if you take a picture
with a flash sometimes you can see that
like a white concealer so I always go
down from inner corner to of II to the
outer corner like that and it's kind of
give the face some shape and dimension
okay so now that we have a little bit of
that under the eyes I'm gonna take it
and just put a little bit of it around
the nose because pretty much all women
get redness around the nose
it's just hormonal so I'm just going to
dab
in that area just to conceal and I'll
also bring it down right here on the
Cupid's bow above the top lip because I
always have a redness or right there on
the top lip area and then I'll take it
and put it on my little friend there and
there and then I'm gonna take a little
bit right on the center of the nose you
it's a very sheer concealer I like it
because I have absolutely no issues at
creasing but I also use a very small
amount and from the drugstore so the
price is right
okay now I'm gonna curl my lashes I'm
using a this is a Lancome lash car and
you know I own a Lancome Lancome Lancome
lash curler this is probably my mom's
anyways I'm gonna curl my lashes like I
normally would I give my lashes like
probably eight just pulse it as I'm
curling it's kind of squeeze squeeze
squeeze squeeze squeeze and then you can
see the difference in my eyes with
lashes that are curled and not curled
and these will kind of go down a little
bit in the next hour or so but I like to
curl them pretty intensely at first
because I'm not gonna have time to be
like we curl my lashes all throughout
the day so I give them a nice tight curl
so that it lasts I'm using Maybelline
pump up colossal volume express mascara
I really like this mascara it's just
nice and fluffy brush and I think it
gives your lashes a lot of volume it
looks like that and I like kind of fat
brushes especially when they come to a
point on the inner corner because you
can really get into the inner corner of
the eye so I'm just gonna go and zig-zag
motions this is oh god that was a big
club I think I'm into this before but if
you ever get mascara anywhere on your
face
don't panic no matter where you get it
just leave it be for at least a full 60
seconds let it dry and then once it
dries it will literally just wipe off if
you try to wipe it off when it's still
wet you're gonna smear it all over the
place and make a big mess so just wait
until it's dry and it will literally
just flake off
okay I'm gonna call my lower lashes
mascara as well and because my lashes
are high maintenance my lashes are not
me I'm gonna be using Rimmel lash
accelerator this is again from the
drugstore my lower lashes are very very
picky they get super clumpy super easy
swift to use certain mascaras it's it's
traumatic
anyways also this is so random but so
many people ask me in my videos if I
have tattooed eyeliner down here and
I've not talked to let her down here
from time to time when I'm filming a
video you'll see that like my lower lash
line is kind of pronounced and darker
and it's because yesterday I had a lot
of eyeliner on the inner rim of my eye
and so when you wash your face even when
you wash and you scrub your eyes you
still sometimes have that leftover
residue right in the base of your lash
line and that's what that is not tattoo
liner pull them above me anyway okay
time to stop singing right now okay so
now I'm going to take clear brow gel
this is the Anastacio Beverly Hills brow
gel whatever you have will do but I'm
telling you this brow gel is super glue
so a lot of it can tend to come out so I
just kind of go like this and wipe off
the brush so that we do not have too
much super glue on our brows and I'll al
all I'm gonna do is just kind of flick
my brows up and then down so we are not
filling them in today we're just giving
them shape because this is a foolproof
thing to do to make your brows look a
little bit fuller more defined and with
this specific brow gel they're not going
to move you can see the difference
between at this brow and this brow it
just has more definition it just looks
fuller just a little bit more
presentable gives the face more shape
like to me personally when I look at
this eye and this eye this eye just
looks better because of the fact that we
have a brow that's defining it better
this is the brow that's always just like
alright oh great with it we will love
you through your ugliness so then I'm
going to go in with a blush I'm going to
using a cream blush I'm going to use mac
cosmetics something special this is one
of my favorite cream blushes ever it has
tons of little brush hairs in it so
don't mind but it's like a really nice
peachy warm
pink shade I just love it and it's
really beautiful for the fall so I'm
just gonna take my fingers like this oh
my gosh we're using no brushes today
okay so just with my finger like this is
gonna tap it off in the back of my hand
you can see if it's very pigmented and
I'm just going to put it lightly on the
apples of the cheeks and then blend it
out and when I blend out with cream
blush with my finger don't worry it's
not going to sometimes when I blend up
cream blush with my finger I like to
kind of press and drag if you will I
don't really know how to explain this
motion that I'm doing but it's kind of
pressing and jewelry agging it quickly I
don't really do this and like move
around and just kind of little movements
of motion so just a really natural flush
to the skin it doesn't really even want
the world wearing blush it just gives us
some color and the cheeks so that we're
not just like lifeless honestly if I
start singing frozen one more time I'm
gonna scream where's gonna add a little
bit of concealer down here because I
just noticed that my chin is looking
very red for some reason so for my lips
I'm going to be using a very bright
lipstick and this is from Maybelline and
it's called vivid rose it looks like
this but I'm not going to be covering my
entire lip so that what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna kind of DAB it lightly
mainly doing this in the center of my
lip almost just like a stain okay I
almost wanted to look like I just like
ate watermelon like bit into a juicy
fruit oh and then I'm just gonna take a
clean of applause I'm using wait is this
clear yeah yes it's gonna work
this is Gerlach tech shear a bone it
looks like this these are great glosses
I really like them I was gonna go over
my lips with this because even when I
wear minimal makeup I just love the way
glossy lips look I don't
like the look of flat lips when you're
wearing minimal makeup I think that it's
just a little actually something just to
pop and add some shine I think looks
really girly all right you guys said
that completes this look as you can see
it is just so simple and so basic and I
just have so many requests recently to
do something that is actually practical
for the everyday woman so I hope that
you guys enjoy this you know it's
obviously not like oh my god
but it's am I gonna make you look a
little bit more fresh and awake and
feminine you know what it literally
takes five minutes so I hope that you
guys enjoy this video I have to run out
the door now to get my hair done ha
thank the heavens I love you guys thank
you for watching I'll see you soon
and bye I don't wanna be a fool
it was gainful to pleats at this mega
Blok moment all right you guys nice and
I'll see you soon bye it's like would
