you would prefer to see a 2013 skincare
favorites or a beauty haul and it was a
perfect tygon the middle so I figured I
would do a UD haul first because it's
easiest for me and then plus I can dig
into my new goodies and not have to wait
to show you on camera so this background
right here again I have a hair stuck in
my mouth again this background is not
permanent it's the only place in my room
for some reason that the lighting was
adjusting correctly and not freaking out
like it was in my last video if Amazon
is applying the truth I should have my
new lighting in about two or three days
so what that gets here I will figure out
a new permanent background but at this
moment just work with me because this is
what we got okay let's get into it so I
went to Sephora I actually think I get
more excited for Sephora as an adult
than I did for the candy store when I
was kid and I hate to go to the candy
store often because my mom didn't like
me ok so first thing I do is stop by
Illamasqua I only want to believe one
thing by Illamasqua so I'm excited to
try these and these are the powder
blushes in the shade hussy and a lover
today I am wearing the shade hussy up on
my cheeks right now I do have a matte
product on the top I have to say we're
at the back the one thing I don't like
about this product is it's difficult to
open and it kind of can like hurt your
nails opening it but the prime side is
extremely pigmented these are both matte
shades like you can see how pigmented
that is from there it's very intense you
only need a tiny bit and the other one I
got was lover leather me it's not open
lover it looks like this it is a true
orange that has a little bit of pink in
it but I will show you with just one
swatch how pigmented these are they
really are impressive how much pigment
they have so that is exciting to me I'm
looking really forward to playing more
with these I didn't see like a blog post
I forgot who it was it's nobody that I
know but I saw a blog post is rating by
Illamasqua
so I'm excited to try then I got the
Illamasqua precision gel liner it was a
little bit on the pricey side but I've
heard that it is absolutely amazing and
when I open it up and saw how much
product you got and saw how black it was
I got super excited and I just love gel
liners it's the only eyeliner i use i
don't use liquid and i rarely use a col
so I'm all about gel liners so I'm
really excited to try this one I got two
products by Becca and these actually I
ordered online they just came in the
mail like two days ago so I figure I
throw them in here this one is the
shimmering skin Perfector with SPF 25 it
is just a skin illuminizer I have not
tried it yet on my face I sampled it on
the back of my hand and it looked
gorgeous and then I also got the
shimmering highlighting powder by Becca
as well and this one is in shade opal
there were a few different shades online
and I couldn't decide which one to get
because hello it's online
this one though I think I made a good
choice it looks really beautiful right
there you guys know me I cannot get
enough of my lighters hey put that bad
boy on hon I picked up two more
Anastacio brow is eyebrow pencils in the
shade ash blonde and soft brown I run
through these like nobody's business
because they are the only thing I use to
fill my brows finally got me NARS lip
gloss in the shade and jelica I feel
like everybody and their mom owns this
except me and when I saw it in personnel
like why don't I own this so I'm really
excited about it I put it on in the car
ride home last night and I love the
color it is a beautiful sheer pink that
has just the right amount of like purple
lilac in it this is a gorgeous color
that will truly complement pretty much
all skin tones light or dark warm or
cool this is gonna look good on pretty
much everyone so I'm excited that I have
this now I got bumble and bumble prepped
a powder this is just a volumizing
powder this recently came out at Sephora
and I saw on Sephora calm and I looked
really interesting to me because I love
love love volumizing powders and for
those of you who asked if they really
work yes it really is a miracle you
would sprinkle in your hand like
powdered sugar you rubbed on yourself
and you have like massive volume so
we're really excited to try
so I love Bumble and Bumble so I hope it
works okay so the rest of my Sephora bag
is skincare related items because I was
super excited being here for some reason
when I was there yesterday so I did just
get a Sephora waterproof eye makeup
remover and this is super simple like
self-explanatory the girl there Michelle
hi Michelle she was tiny this is her
favorite eye makeup remover and I just
needed a simple eye makeup remover so
why not thank you I got the new glam
glow thirsty bun hydrating treatment
masque oh my god I am so excited about
this mask you guys you have no idea okay
so I totally opened up last night and
use it in its honey holes when I woke up
this morning my husband noticed that my
skin looked so gorgeous and I was like
thank you glam glow this is the main
reason that I took a trip to Sephora
yesterday was for this glam glow
treatment so because of that I got like
a little skin care obsessed and went a
little nuts in the skincare section of
Sephora these two next purchases were
totally inspired by Nicole Guerrero they
are by perricone MD I am super excited
to try both of them this one is the blue
clouds mothers a non acidic daily peel
for brightness and radiance and this one
is a deep moisture therapy daily
moisturizer I used to work at Nordstrom
and all a perricone md's customers were
so loyal to the brand and had nothing
but good things to say about it but when
I worked there I could not afford the
skincare so I always kind of drunked
about owning it but I couldn't own it so
when I saw Nicole make that video it was
like a haul that she did recently I was
like oh my god yes thank you dr.
Perricone hello where have you been on
my life so when I was standing at
Sephora I'm looking at everything and
looking at my options these two the
exact same ones that she bought I was
like those are the ones I want they're
both made for dry skin they're both made
for deep hydration and sensitivity
right miss radiant so yeah I'm super
excited then I got two body butters of
both the bicep and glory this one is in
a tub this one is made to this one is
called the righteous butter and it
literally smells just like Miss Dior if
you know what that smells like
it is identical and scent just not as
strong as they perfume this one is in a
tube the daily smooth amazingly
effective dry skin formula body butter
this scent is a little bit more warm it
smells like it has a little bit more
vanilla in it than this one does I love
body butters this time of year
Who am I kidding I love body butters all
year long I don't care I love body
butters I love how creamy and luxurious
they are and buttery it's recommended to
me by the lady who worked there it is
the wild rose daily brightening and
refinishing buff cleanser I'm super
excited use this it's like a daily
exfoliator for the face it is by the
brand Korres chorus I'm not sure how to
pronounce it it would it be a haul video
if I didn't know how to pronounce at
least one Maran right last skincare
product is by be brand new it is pro
genius treatment oil it has Omega 3 6 7
&amp;amp; 9
I was told this is great for everything
anti-aging wrinkles
hydrating brightening everything you can
think of so I'm really really excited to
use this if you guys watch my channel
you know that I'm obsessed with beauty
oils and they are like such a thing
right now when I walk into my Sephora
there's like an entire wall of every
single oil everybody needs a beauty oil
in our life so I'm super super excited
right then I went to lush this bag
smelled intense I got a new ocean salt
face and body scrub I've mentioned my
past videos that I exploit with organic
sugar which I actually still love but
this is one of the only exfoliator that
I've ever tried other than the organic
sugar that I just really really love and
I think it's gentle enough we get it's
harsh enough at the same time if that
makes sense
it's great for my sensitive skin and it
has sea salt in it which is really nice
because sea salt can really help combat
acne be it it doesn't dry you out a lot
of like a lot of acne products does I
hope that I just like made sense to you
then I got the Karma cream this is a
hand and body lotion and it has cocoa
butter in it and almond oil which I
usually love those two combined I really
like the scent it's not too warm so I
really don't like anything that has like
Amber or musk in it it just it's too
warm and makes me feel like I'm like a
bakery or something but this one has a
very clean soft scent to it but it also
has that almond oil in it that makes it
still smell the perfect amount of warmth
I got a new shower gel I got a new
shower gel called dirty spring wash I
honestly which is still attracted to the
color and it smells like mint it says
don't be dirty get fresh with this
tingly an extremely minty shower gel and
I love anything mint to your peppermint
tea and especially when it comes to
showering it's like so revitalizing and
refreshing so okay TMI about my shower
time I got another breath of fresh air
this is a toner water is a mineral rich
sea breeze captured in a bottle so I
have owned this before I got the smaller
bottle I don't know why I get the big
ones I already know I like it but you
just spray on after you wash your face
and then go on with your serums or your
daily or nightly routine whichever one
you like it's just a nice ton of ARDS
you can spray and not just have to like
take it and rub it on so yeah I really
like these toners toner
I like blushes toners I like this one
I'm done and then I got two lip balms a
honey trap in a it started with a kiss
lip tint I love love love these I have
not tried this one yet lip tint but the
honey trap lip balm I swear by it it's
like my favorite lip balm in the entire
world it's one in a little tin to chips
like rub around with your finger oh my
god it is so amazing and so moisturizing
it almost is like wax it's so
moisturizing on your lips it's awesome
you put this on and you will not have to
reapply anything to your lips for a
couple of hours it's great I totally got
a second one for my mom and then I have
my Congress six other things in here
that are just like fat bombs and bath
melts and I'm not going to go through
every single one individually because I
don't it doesn't say on there what it is
I'm not going to open it up and show to
you but I will say that my favorite bath
balm by lush is the butterball it is so
amazing and so moisturizing you throw it
in your back of your own with bath bomb
and it literally like fizzes and like a
clothes of your bath tub and the
butterball is my favorite because when
you get out you literally don't have to
moisturize and moisturizes your skin for
you in the bathtub it is I feel like I
have sometimes we're going to quickly go
through some other things I have
purchased in the last week hopefully
this isn't an hour long
I did get these to Oscar blondie
products I've never used Oscar blondie
and I randomly saw them when I was at
Target and I was like mine and this one
is a texture and volume spray and this
one is the volumizing dry shampoo spray
I love anything that has to do with
volumizing and especially when it's
something that is a volumizing product
it doesn't make your hair extremely
sticky and or greasy oh my god I've got
these three days ago and I am obsessed
with both of them this one is the
perfect texturizing spray in the world
this is turning into review and alcohol
but honestly you can't help me like when
I buy something I want to try to mediate
Lee and this texture and volumizing
spray is off the chizzain
then I got this Loreal Elnett satin hair
sprays extra stronghold I picked it up
because I was again at Target and I
needed it extra strong hold hairspray
because I ran out of mine I need
something quick and I love this
hairspray it really does work but it is
stinky and it.this is the one that I was
referring to in the end of my last video
where I said this hairspray smells like
piss um it was this it's piss in a
bottle but it's great alright guys that
is it for my beauty haul I will be back
soon with my 2013 a skincare favorites I
love you guys if you enjoyed and I'll
see you soon bye
