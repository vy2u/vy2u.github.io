open up the door to my makeup room
workspace I'm not really sure what to
call this rooms I've never given a tango
before I'll give you an overview of the
entire room so you can kind of get a
feel for how it's set up and as if you
were here with me over to the right the
first thing you'll see is a gigantic
mirror and then we have my work desk a
big tall lingerie chest with a lamp on
top my makeup vanity with my makeup
collection right there I have a zebra
chair from home goods that's what I sit
in when I film I move it to this other
corner that right there is a closet and
then I have more beauty products right
there with perfumes on top a door to my
bathroom and then I'm sure you guys will
recognize this corner because this is
where I sit and film and do the thing
for the tube I have to be honest I'm so
over this corner I want to change it up
I need inspiration I'm working with a
very small space so it's difficult but I
need help so if you guys can think of
anything cool I could do this corner
like give me ideas send me pictures
anything cuz I am just not feeling this
background anymore I need a change so
that is that and then we land back at
the door with the gigantic mirror again
so maybe that'll give you kind of an
idea for the layout of this room okay so
now we are at the start of the room
again and honestly just please ignore me
I could not look more like 90s trash if
I tried so that's not what this video is
about this mirror right here I purchased
this about a year and a half ago from Z
Gallerie
and I honestly got this because it was
just me living out a childhood dream of
mine because growing up I would spend
hours every single day in front of my
mirror singing and dancing hashtag
homeschool problems but this is just
like the most amazing gigantic mirror
like you could have a dance party with
your entire family like I'm talking
great aunts and uncles and cousins and
grandparents like this thing is so huge
though I just had to have it like I was
drawn to it like a moth to a flame so
that is the first thing you see when you
walk into the room so moving on to my
workspace I purchased this desk at IKEA
and it actually really needs to be
replaced because it's falling apart and
it's very scuffed up
it took so long to put together that I'm
like no keep riding with me so I
replaced the hardware right here with
hardware from Anthropologie that's kind
of my little trick all fine pieces at
like thrift stores or garage sales or
even places like IKEA and then I'll
replace the hardware with really pretty
hardware and I feel like it just takes
everything up a notch and just makes it
look a little bit prettier and more
glamorous the work chair is from Z
Gallerie I absolutely love this chair it
gives great back support so on my
desktop I have this lamp from Pottery
Barn which I am just so in love with
next to it I have my newer Polaroid
camera I just thought this about a month
ago and I've already gone through like
three rolls of films I love it so much
then in the back my favorite thing ever
I have this candy jar filled with OCC
lip tars which is just like my office
out in the world me because I refer to
Sephora as Candyland so having a candy
jar full of lip products is just like it
warms my heart every single morning it
makes me smile next to that I have this
mug that have my logo on it my mom made
this for me for when I hit 1 million
subscribers it was so sweet and I just
keep colored pencils pens highlighters
in here it's like I said this is my work
desk and then of course I have a random
Sigma brush because this would not be
Jacqueline's house desk if there wasn't
a brush on there right then over on the
other side of my desk I just have a
calculator that sits right here this is
a blingy calculator that I got from Z
Gallerie and I think my home is the
gallery show home at points but that's
okay I have a little fresh candle that
smells so amazing and I've never lived
in it even though I want to because it's
so cute and so tiny and so expensive and
I'm like no we're not gonna lie to you
were just gonna keep you there for show
then I have this clock that is also from
Z Gallerie that my husband actually just
bought me like two weeks ago and then
these flowers are my new addition for
spring which I am so excited about
because it is such a random fact about
me but I am obsessed with any type of
flower arrangements
they're short and fluffy and fat and
square vases I know that's so random but
like I can't
okay so moving right along in this
corner I have a lingerie chest that is
huge and amazing it holds so much and I
got this from Horchow but it's actually
from the exact same collection as my
mirror but I got this from Horchow even
though I got my mirror from Z Gallerie
because they were having like a 35% off
day and hello I just wanted to save the
money so I got my chest from Horchow on
top of it I have a lamp because it was
beginning to feel like a very dark hole
with that piece in the corner so I had
to bring back some light then with my
makeup collection sitting right here
directly above that I have this banner
that my family it was so sweet to make
for me when I hit 1 million subscribers
on YouTube and it just says
congratulations on hitting 1 million
subscribers Jacqueline we love you and
are so proud your amazeballs
so I thought that was so sweet and I
wasn't gonna just shove it in a closet
or something and I thought it was
totally appropriate to hang right above
my makeup vanity so here is an overview
of my makeup vanity the drawers in the
tabletop are two separate things they
are both from Ikea the drawers are the
alux drawers and they are seriously the
best drawers ever to store makeup
whether you have a small collection or a
big collection they just fit so much and
they're so incredibly deep they're ideal
for storing makeup then the tabletop I
don't know what it's called but I will
just say right now the size of tabletop
that I have is much longer in the back
so it does have probably like five to
six inches of overhang I know a lot of
people have asked me about that that's
why I have it shoved up against the wall
so you can't see the back because there
is a very big gap on top if that makes
sense
this lighted mirror is from vanity girl
Hollywood and it does have a switch to
make these lights brighter and dimmer
depending what you need at that moment
and then there's an on and off switch
right there
it also has plugs for like curling irons
and straighteners on the other side
which I absolutely love I've had this
now for over a year and oh my gosh I am
like thankful for this mirror every
single day it's so amazing so here on my
first shelf I have this adorable little
box that a subscriber made me you can
actually see her holding this in
my vlog from Chicago at my
meet-and-greet she's so cute and then
here I had a cut from Anthropologie with
a J on it with almost all of my pencil
eyeliners I just feel like it's so easy
to find them like this with just sitting
in a mug and then next to that I have my
Zara Beauty a lipstick tower which is
just so much fun then the Shelf right
above that I have more goodies I have
this mug right here that I found on Etsy
that says you've the same amount of
hours in a day as Beyonce which I love I
have this little glass plaque that Sigma
was so sweet to give me when I hit a
million subscribers behind that I have
like a little painting from a subscriber
that she gave me at a meet-and-greet
that says my name on it and I thought it
was so cool and then here I have a mug
that a subscriber made me which is so
beautiful all these little things just
means so much to me and I like to keep
them out just to remind myself how
blessed I am every single day again a
subscriber made this for me and then
behind there that little painting my
niece's made that for me and I died over
those eyelashes every time like are
those other cutest things I've ever seen
I keep tons of more stuff that you guys
have given me in this closet
I have tons of stuff hung it up and hung
up in there on the wall but I also keep
some little things out here just to keep
me keep a smile on my face so on the
opposite side I have my first shelf
right here which is just nothing but lip
products and I love this shelf because I
love lip products so so much I have
these acrylic cases right here to hold
the lipsticks I get these from the
Container Store and I just have all
different lipsticks like the front row
is why it's a line I have some the Lime
Crime Charlotte Tilbury and that has
some Mac and then back here I have all
my gerard lip glosses which there's
always and these faces with my gerard
lip glosses because they're like my
favorite and I grab the minotaur with my
purse and I forget to put them back I
have some dose of colors of glosses back
there same with in the front row dose of
colors and then Gerard Mac and I have
okay and then back here just random
glasses like Gerlach tech D or Mac just
NARS all different ones on this back row
and then this cup is the same than the
other one from anthropology and instead
we have a black H I went through a phase
where I was obsessive getting things
monogrammed with H because when I first
got married I was so excited to get away
from my maiden name that I was obsessed
the last name Hill so I have like aprons
and towels and mugs and coasters
everything you can think of with H's in
my house and then in that I have a lip
liner so same thing as I do with
eyeliners which is the list on this side
I do love storing my stuff like this I
think it's just so easy to find then up
here on the top shelf
I have palettes so this right here is a
CD organizer that I got from the
Container Store that I keep palettes in
I have the electric palette in the lorac
unzipped the Anastasi a lavish I have
the lorac here and then the lorac Pro
here Urban Decay and then all my fate
whew my favorite things with to feast
there in the back and then right here I
have the Naked palette one two and three
and then I have the glorious and a
Saskia Beverly Hills contour book which
is funny because I pulled this down and
use it quite often and I could just get
them in the same clothes but instead of
it may be difficult on myself I've used
like this entire book but I just
actually loved it I think it's the
coolest thing ever so moving on to the
actual table top of my vanity
I have these acrylic drawers right here
that I believe I got from the Container
Store and sitting on top of that I have
these lip gloss holders which I am just
die hard for when I found these on
Amazon I about went nuts because I just
needed these are the coolest acrylic
container from lip glosses and it just
makes it so easy to find your color as
opposed to when they're in your drawer
so I have two of them sitting right next
to each other just filled with glasses I
have this Smashbox lip lacquers which I
absolutely love I have some a cloth
design signal glosses I have the LA girl
bleh flip paint I have some Too Faced
melted I have some NARS girl lactic girl
lactic is just like the bomb I have some
more mac i have buxom i
nars noticed tons of different lip
glosses fact right here and I just was
like I use more lip products ever since
I got this a while back and I just see
it all laid out so any natural drawers I
store products that I tend to reach for
all the time so not necessarily like my
favorite products at the moment but just
things that like never die that I
continue to use so just like good solid
top beauty products in the top drawer I
have my highlighters i have mary lou
manizer by the balm which is just like
the most important highlighter and then
I have a Bobbi Brown bronze glow but
everything she did Bobbi Brown will make
this permanent because it was for her
holiday question and it's just so
gorgeous I have math global glow Mac
soft and gentle and then I have Smashbox
shimmer and this is their soft light and
it's just so gorgeous it's got the nice
kinky undertone so it's beautiful on
people who have really fair skin and
then in the back corner I have a hard
candy tiki which is such an awesome and
drugstore highlight and I love this but
it actually breaks me out I have really
sensitive skin and it actually gives me
texture on my cheekbones so you're not
sensitive like me though I would really
recommend that because it's really
inexpensive you pick it up at Walmart
and it's really beautiful in the second
drawer I have blushes and I use this
drawer to store all of mine are flushes
because this drawer you can put two on
top of each other and stack them like
that and it just makes it easy because I
can store more and then I would with
just a basic like matte blushes so all
of my NARS blush is which I'm not going
to go to them because I do have to work
and take ten of them and then here I
have Mac style Mac alpine bronze which
was one of my favorite blushes that Mac
ever made and again this was limited
edition and I wish today Omega permits
and then Mac Pro Longwear rosy outlook
which is just such a beautiful color
that I used to use on rides all of the
other side in the third drawer I have
bronzers I have makeup forever bronzer
number 30 benefit hoola bronzer and ARS
Laguna bronzer
Mac care blend in the shade dark which
isn't technically a powder I mean a
bronzer it's a powder but I'm use it as
a bronzer I have two of them because
this one is pretty much gone and then I
have bobbi and brown bronzer in the
shade
what is this golden light one so
this next drawer is seriously the most
visually stimulating drawer for me every
time I open it up I swear it's just like
I'm makeup happy rainbow it's such an
awesome so these are all of the
anastacio liquid lipsticks i did a full
video review and swatches on these cuz i
will link that down below if you want to
see it but I just love this drawer and I
had to keep them all grouped together
that way they didn't wander off and get
lost because that's exactly what would
happen if I did put them in this pen
drawer and in the last drawer and here
are just products that I use all the
time that I just can't live without I
have the benefit gimme brow maybelline
eye studio gel liner and make it forever
liquid liner a chroma graphic pencil by
Mac for my waterline in NC 59 done 20 I
have an art in see in black kohl liner a
couple anastacio brow is--is little
scissors down there which are from
Anastacio as well the trim lashes and
brows and stuff like that I have an
Anastasia brow highlighter a lot of an
associate products clearly a necessity a
brow gel and then to all the pro
mascaras so that is what that door is
just like my go-to drawer that I have to
have these things no matter what look
I'm doing so on the opposite side of my
desk I have another acrylic makeup
storage unit this is the original beauty
box I will link it down below for you
guys I'll link like everything I'm
talking about down below for you guys to
make it easy this right here on top I
have a lipstick holder again from The
Container Store filled with matte
lipsticks and then right in the front I
have for art at the end lipsticks I have
my Chanel cream bronzer and then the
Chanel liquid bronzer as well sitting
right there because I use this all the
time and then I have to a yfl I believe
these are the love sheer lipsticks
because I just use these constantly even
if I'm not wearing makeup I'll come in
here
I don't let's put these on because it's
so sheer and it gives you like just the
tiniest bit of color ever and it just
looks very natural so then in this top
drawer I have Oh what do you know more
lip pops I have lime Khandava teens all
over here I have a mac lip gloss in the
shade speed through I have a couple of
bite beauty products I just love love
than the products I have a Croma Beauty

here I have all of my the balm blushes

fooling I feel like it doesn't look like
it's gonna be something that's gonna be
like outstanding for some reason when
I'm holding the packaging but they are
seriously such great blushes I actually

out of my box and then like I said most
of these are makeup geek makeup for ever
and Mac this right here is my everyday
palette this is the one I travel with
this is the one that I can't without you
guys have probably seen this 500 times
because I use it in almost every single
video this is my absolute favorite
drawer out of the entire desk and this
is like the mother lode of blushes and
highlighters and bronzers so we have
like every brand you can think of right
here right here we have a container from
The Container Store which is a big fat
consumed in our filled with all these
luscious and then these right here these

magnetic blushes and then back here I
also have a makeup geek blushes as well
third drawer down this is kind of a
random so the third drawer down in the
Alex Soares they begin to get a lot
deeper so we have a lot more depth to
work with so I have this in here which
is nice and deep and solid I got this
one container store and then it is
filled with just
any type of eye product you can think of
liquid eyeliner solid eyeliner mascara
eye paints eyeshadow bases samples gel
liner just any sort of eye products this
is where they live next to that I have
the hourglass palette of the
highlighters and I also have the blush

they both hang out right there then I

not used yet but I'm I will it's just
taking some time I have to cover up X
clean highlight and contour and then I
have the anastacio Beverly Hills cream
highlight and contour in this store as
well okay so now for the fourth drawer
this is the drawer of palettes an
excessive amount of palette so right
here on top I have my Jaclyn hill
favorites palette by morphe and it fits
in here because it's too big to fit in
any other drawer so that's why it's
right there so in this drawer we have
everything these are all anastasi
Beverly Hills single eyeshadows but
there's no room for them up in that top
drawer so I put them there we have the
toothpaste everything's nice we have the

palettes the Omri Z and we had the
catwalk palette I have stood my palettes

semi-sweet chocolate abuse blueberry
swirl call it right here I know it's so
random
the stigma Resort palette from back in
the day I used to love this palette I
was obsessed with these two shades than
Mila Midori just a random fact so this
is just nothing but palettes galore and
even if I don't use these still for some
reason it's one of those things like I
don't want to give away because it's
unsanitary to give these away at this
point because I use them all so much
also I just have like such great
memories because this Jordans makes me
very very happy so this is my palette or
little George George okay so last drawer
on the left hand side over here on the
right hand side we have all color pop
eyeshadows which I talk about them in a
favorites video these eyeshadows are so
crazy like I suggest that everyone
really Daugherty I suggest everyone just
buy one of these shadows just a feel of
consistency because there's nothing in
the world like it they're so cool and
different right here I have mixed
products I have a few of my favorite
eyeshadow colors from NYX just right
here and I have a few new NYX blush in
then I have some eye bases and cream
color concentrate from obsessive
compulsive cosmetics right here by the
way both of these acrylic things Cape is
whatever you want to call them are from
the Container Store then right here on
the left hand side these are all the new
color pop blushes they just sent these
to me a couple of weeks ago and I
screamed like a little girl and I
immediately came and put them all in
here so I will take them out of their
packaging this week but I just love the
way it looks right now and I really
really like the consistency of these
blushes they're like so watery and
different and they just look very
healthy and natural on the cheeks I have
like a random stash of morphe brushes
right here and then I have time of loose
pigments in glitter these are all from
obsessive compulsive cosmetics right
here again like the mother lode of loose
pigments so that is that last drawer so
let's move to the right side
alright so now
on the right-hand side this first drawer
is just nothing about foundations
concealers and primers so right here we
have foundations galore

highlight contour sticks I keep my eye
drops right here which are the roto cool
drops because this is always the first
show I open in the morning when I get
ready because I want to grab my
concealer to prime my eyes so I keep
this right here so I use my eye drops
right here I have powders I make it
forever Mac NARS then I have the Revlon
Colorstay whipped foundation and I have
some primers over here Chanel Mac Make
Up For Ever HD and then more primers

so this is all faced concealer drawer so
now for the second drawer I have even
more foundations it's my thing
I love foundations foundations blushes
and lip products those are like my
favorite things and make up so more
foundations in here I keep my go-to
current foundation in the first one and
I kind of go back and forth exchanging
them out
so more foundations here and then I have
primers I have setting spray all that
jazz I have the Smashbox primer water
I have a skin vanadium primer underneath
of there priming water I should say
masks fixed on Urban Decay chill and all
nighter makeup forever miss them v I
used to use mist and fix on tons of my
brides back in the day when I was
hustling in the Tampa area motives 10
years younger makeup setting spray
I had the NYX dewy finish which is
hilarious my friend who is oily when she
saw this she was like oh my god you're
so disgusting you have grease in a
bottle but I love to look
this right here is filled with more
correctors concealers I have Maybelline
fit me I have Cogan do I have Mac prep
and prime I have Revlon I have tons of
different under-eye concealers face
correctors and that type of jazz and
then back here I have the newer NARS

thinking about here because I'm gonna
give it to my friend when I see her next
okay so third drawer down this is more
lip products I know it's a lot these are
here are from the Container Store that
since we're the third drawer down it's
deeper so I use these really really deep
bins I got from The Container Store
which I absolutely love so even though
these are three different bins that kind
of treat it like one I don't have a
specific place for any of these things
they just kind of float around and I
just kind of dig through here like a kid
in the candy store to be quite honest
but I just love lip products so much and
this was really the only way I could
think to organize this many lip products
and only one drawer then back here I
have the colour-pop lippie stix with a
few more NYX lip butters but our glasses
underneath I love these lippie stix I
got a line i bought tons more and i also
purchased the Lumiere which is the one
that kathleenlights created and I
absolutely love this shade it's so so so
beautiful I've been wearing it
constantly since I got it then I just
have her into makeup removers I have
made it forever spent sighs I have a
Sephora one and a benefit one and my
baby Blender Clint cleanser and then I
have some just cotton rounds from to BES

Georgie last anomalies this drawer is my
shameful drawer I feel like we are all
entitled to one of these drawers and
this is mine so this is my hash tag
don't judge me drawer I know I know you
guys like don't ask why I really have a
pair of like fishnets in here I have a
lot I have sunscreen I have contour but
you know what's build money it's as
disgusting as this is it's like
controlled chaos because I know that
it's horrible but it's so funny because
I know what's in here like for instance
I use this yesterday and I love this
product but I'm like this is where you
live now I use this all the time I've
been loving this blush by benefit baby
that all just goes back in here so even
though the drawer is so disgusting I use
these things in this drawer like it's so
strange I don't know how I can do this I
feel like I'm entitled to like one messy
zone in like every organized area so
this is my messy zone that needs to be
taken care of for the time being it's
just like whatever so really quickly
over here onto my chest I have one more
drawer of lashes I know it's a bit
excessive to say the least and let's

jewelry but it's what I'm working with
right now so here I have all of my boots
if you guys know me you know that I'm so
big on hoops and a lot of you guys will
ask me where my favorite hoops are from
and I think them from Claire's because
they're so inexpensive and it takes him
a long time to get kind of tarnished and
yucky so they're like five to eight
dollars I really like that these are
like my gigantic Beyonce hoops and over
here I have like smaller earrings just
earrings earrings earrings galore this
is my earrings drawer oh my god that one
Mac last drawer that actually has
anything substantial is my sunglass
drawer oh I have an obsession with
sunglasses gonna keep them all in their
cases no matter how expensive or
inexpensive I keep them in their cases
otherwise they'd just be destroyed and
scratched I know myself too well so I
always put my sunglasses in here I don't
leave them to my purse I bring them
right back here to keep them nice and
safe in their little drawer and I tuck
them in goodnight alright guys thank you
