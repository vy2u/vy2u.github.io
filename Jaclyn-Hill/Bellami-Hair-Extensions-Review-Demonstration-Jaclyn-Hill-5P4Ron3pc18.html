little bit of a different video than I
normally do here on my channel as you
can tell by the title I'm going to be
talking about Bellamy hair extensions
this has been a very highly requested
video from you guys I did briefly talk
about them in my last monthly favorites
video and I got a lot of you guys
telling me that you wanted to see a more
in depth video elaborating on these
extensions and let me just start off by
telling you guys right up front that I
am in no way educated on hair I am
educated on makeup and I'm very into
fashion but when it comes to hair it
just never really been my thing I mean
it kind of overwhelms me sometimes I do
curl my hair or I used to straighten my
hair a lot but other than that it's just
like it needs to be simple I do the
makeup I do the outfit and then I
usually throw my hair on top of my head
around the door so basically in order
for me to like something that has to do
with hair it needs to be completely
effortless and very easy and quick now
if you guys watch youtube religiously
then I'm sure you've heard about the
Bellamy hair extensions because they've
really made their way around YouTube
recently and let me just say that there
is a reason why because they're
amazeballs
I'm going to be completely entirely
honest with you in the past year or so I
have had quite a few hair extension
companies reach out to me and asked if
they could send me some extensions and
if I liked them I could review them I
have never come on camera mentioning a
hair extension brand before I'm never
taking a picture of it I've never talked
about hair extensions because in the
past I have never liked any honest to
god they just kind of look straight
they don't blend very well they don't
feel real they feel kind of like natty
they get really naughty really easily
they're uncomfortable just different
reasons now I'm making an entire video
on these because I love them so much I
never knew the hair extensions could be
so easy to use so comfortable and so
effortless I absolutely love these so
these are the bellissima they are 220
grams and they are the 22 inches so
these are long which is amazing because
my hair is naturally not super short not
crazy long but it's got some length in
there but my hair is super super fine
like naturally my hair is glued to my
head I mean I have to put so much root
boosting products and my hair to get any
volume
so these are amazing forests but someone
like me especially who has long hair but
thin you put a few of these in and it
just makes your long hair look so thick
and full they are double drawn which
means they're the same thickness from
root all the way to tip so you're not
going to have that straggly stringy like
kind of ratty hair well I'm being so
mean I'm sorry girls if you're wearing
straggly stringy ready hair anyways
they're going to look natural on anybody
rather your hair is long short thick
thin they're going to look natural
especially because of the double drawn
factor they are so shiny and so soft and
now some extensions will have like that
plasticky shiny look where it's like
really fake these are 100% human hair so
the shine in these are just so beautiful
now since it is real hair you can use
Hot Tools on them you can use heat
protectant hairspray hair products you
can wash them the way you treat human
hair don't only wash them when you
really feel like you have to because it
can dull down the life of the hair and
the appearance I have my program month
and I have not washed them once so I
just don't feel like they need it yet
I've used heat pot tools and cheap
products on them and I just don't feel
like they need it yet they're still
feeling like the day I got them I did
get mine in the shade vibrant red and
when they got here they were the same
color as my hair but two to three shades
to light so I took them to my
hairdresser and I asked me if he could
dye them and he did and he literally
died them to three shades darker I know
I get so many questions about my hair
color it's like the most asked question
of all time on my channel and I try to
respond to as many of you as possible
letting you know that I do get it
professionally done and the guy that
does it says that there really is no
formula to give to anybody because it
depends on if you're blonde brunette
what color brunette what color blonde
but I will say that if you really want
to know my hair color you could just buy
the vibrant red ones take it to a
hairdresser and say I want this hair
color two to three shades darker and
that's exactly where I am he did say
that he had to dye them two times
because he said there must have been a
safety seal or protectant on these two
obviously protect them so he did have to
dye dyed in a couple of times in order
for them to pick up color he said the
first time that he dyed them that
basically was no difference and it
I ended up picking up now I am using a
hanger to keep them in this because at
first I was just like where do I keep
these every night like you take them out
of your head and you have all these
loose extensions and you're just kind of
like uh so I'll just kind of laying them
across my make up desk and then one day
while I was gone
one must have fallen down and georgy my
dog jumped up and got ahold of it and
when I came home he was literally under
the Christmas tree with one of my hair
extensions and it was demolished it was
like this ball of just torn apart fluff
he must have had it for an hour because
that dog doesn't do much damage so
because of that I do as soon as I take
them out of my head put them in this
hanger and then hang them up on
something you could even hang this in
your closet and scare people with your
clothes if you want but I hang this up
so that they're protected and it keeps
them nice hanging here so they're not
getting knotted or rubbing together or
anything around dirty surfaces so yeah I
just keep them in this there's also like
this garment bag type thing that kind of
looks like you would keep closing it for
suits and this is for traveling and I
will definitely be using this when I
travel so that they're protected and not
rubbing on your clothes because I also
thought about that I mean when you
purchase extensions you're going to have
them for such a long time it's important
to take safety precautions and keep them
nice because you don't want to go
spending that money like you know every
couple of months
so yes I'm keeping them on a hanger and
I have a garment bag ready for me to
travel to LA yes I'm going to LA next
month I'll see you I'm s I really do
like this hanger this hanger also is
from Bellamy by the way all lists every
single thing I talk about in this video
down below in the description bar okay
so I am going to show you exactly how I
put these in and style them into my hair
first thing I do is just brush my
natural hair so that no knots or tangles
are interfering with the extensions now
the Bellamy hair extensions do come with
ten Wes lifts are these individual
pieces of hair so you do get two of the
four clips two of the three clips two of
the two clips which I only have one of
them because Jordie ate the other one
and then four of the single strands so
what you're going to do now is section
off your hair and I like to put my first
weft and pretty low I put it down here
below the ear
area I'm just feeling out right now
obviously not looking at any mirror I
like to keep it down really low so
there's barely any natural hair here
these are really helped blend it in it
so I am starting off with a two so all
you're going to do is just take these
and just clip them right in that area
and you can tease your hair if you want
to make it easier I have very fine thin
hair and it still holds in there no
problem like I don't really see it
necessary to tease but if for some
reason they're slipping out you can
tease the root and then it'll really
stay in there but I've never had an
issue with that then letting the hair
down and sectioning off another piece I
would say about half an inch to an inch
above it I pretty much go to the ear
area now so the first left is right here
and now the second one is going to be up
here I hope you guys can see this in the
camera and now we're going to go in with
a three weft so it's basically like an
upside down here then you go two three
four so you want to put in the two at
the base of your head and then the three
and then as your head gets wider before
so now we have on the three right there
and you can see just like this it
already starts to blend and look like
your natural hair so you just want to
keep building that pyramid upward now I
am NOT going to use every single weft if
I use every single piece of hair and
here I have got like crazy huge hair so
I usually use about four weft
I mean if you want to put them all in if
you have super super thin hair it's
going to give you like a full head of
hair but I don't use all them because I
think it looks a little too dramatic so
now we're going to go right about that
next one again about half an inch to an
itch whatever you think is going to work
for you and now I'm going to put in a
four and there are two fours one is
shorter than the other this is the
shorter one and then you can see the
difference how much longer the second
one is they're both four but this one is
longer so the longer one you want to use
higher up in this area where your head
has the most region in the most hair so
I'm going to put the smaller four one
right here
now this time we're going to go and inch
at least above that one I'm not going to
put it right over top of it I'm going to
make sure that it's a good inch and now
we're going to put in the long fourth
one you definitely can before putting
them in your hair just brush through
them but I brush through them before I
hung them up two days ago so I knew that
mine didn't really need a big brushing
because they were already brushed okay
whoo so I have four weft and right now
one of the twos one of the three and
then two of the four so going upward so
you can see how this looks and you can
see how want is now this the extensions
have a slight wave in it from last time
I wore them I had a really loose curl in
it and my hair is like pin straight so
obviously you cannot have away the
extension and pinch straight hair so we
are going to go through and curl it so
that it looks much more blended so now
it's basically just that exact same
sectioning off process and then you just
curl it as you go so much hair basic I
tend to brush every piece as I move
along just because I really really hate
like knotty
frizzy curls so I like to just brush it
as I go just make sure that it's being
curled like perfectly brushed I am using
a Bellamy curling wand I don't know the
name of it all I know is it's really
good and it's really really hot so be
careful I am using the 32 millimeter
barrel on this one so it gives really
really big luscious waves there is a
coupon code for you guys I'll put it in
my description bar below this video it's
something crazy like 150 or like 150
dollars off so I'll have that down there
so I just take the hair and curl it
going backward hold it for about five
seconds and let it go and move on and if
you really really want to take the time
to make sure that your curl is going to
last you for literally like a couple
days you can spray each individual curl
and get a quick scrunch and then move on
to the next one it's something that I do
when my hair is completely clean I know
you have to wash it for a couple of days
because my curl will literally be in my
hair for three days this piece of hair
right here by my face I always curl this
one in work just because I like these
inner pieces to frame my face everything
else goes backward
okay so at this point my hair is
completely curled as you can see but I
have not run my fingers through it all
I've done is curl this you can see up on
the top I've got like crazy curls I let
it sit like this for about five to ten
minutes before I start running my
fingers through it and really messing it
up because if you go in and start like
kind of moving it around and fluffing it
up while it's still hot it's just going
to release the curl and go flat so make
sure it's completely cooled down so this
is usually the moment where I go get
dressed and then I've left my hair
before I leave the house and by the way
I was using not your mother's she's a
tease volumizing hairspray but every
single product I use will be in the
description bar below so now I'm going
to take big sexy hair powder play I love
these powder volumizers my favorite one
is Bed Head though it's literally just a
powder like powdered sugar that you put
in your hand like this you rub your
hands together and then you just rub it
through your scalp kind of massage and
all it's going to do is just give you
tons of volume kind of makes your hair
feel like it's dirty but in a good way
so I just lean to the side and I just
start scratching my scalp and you just
want to go through and break up that
curl so that they're not splud to each
other and you can just do this right
over those extensions now I person don't
like it when my extensions go from like
big to small at the end so I like a
little bit more thickness and volume
down there so I just take a comb this is
Conair it's from the drugstore and I
just take this side where it's a little
bit more wide and I just lightly go in
and move it upward and knots like crazy
otherwise you'll really tangle your
extensions but I just do it slightly and
all this will do is give you a little
bit more volume and it'll give your
extensions separation so they don't
cling to each other at the bottom
now you can obviously see a very big
difference between this side and this
side that has not been separated and the
only difference is that I just did that
backward movement with the comb
throughout this side of my hair and it
just makes it look so much more thick
and voluminous and healthy where now you
can see this side just looks kind of
like just to chill so I'm gonna do the
same thing on this side
got boom so this is the finished look
with all the products all the curling
and everything so you can now see what
it looks like in the back with the
finished product how well it blends and
how natural it looks it doesn't look
like ratty or too thin it blends in so
perfectly and this isn't even all of the
hair extensions I left out five six
pieces so can you imagine like how much
would be happening if I had in all of
the ten weft it's like insane not to
mention they are coming out with the
Lily hair which is even thicker than
this one so it's like the possibilities
are endless so yes obviously I am 100%
Pro Bellamy there's a reason that you're
seeing them talked about everywhere here
on YouTube they're absolutely amazing if
you're going to spend the money and
invest in extensions
trust me and invest in Bellamy so I
really hope that you guys enjoy this
video hopefully this helps out some of
you beginners who are kind of confused
and how to wear them and style them
exactly like I once was I love you so
much and I'll see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
