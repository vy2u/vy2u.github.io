to be my favorite beauty products from
all of 2015 this was like I was so picky
about what I was going to put in this
video I have been making a list in my
mind and my phone and pulling products
for the past five days like it has been
ridiculous how picky a bit about this
but it can so easily become way too much
and I wanted to really like make sure
that I'm just putting in like my
absolute favorites that were substantial
products that I love so much New Year
2015 which is funny because I still have
like oh I don't know 136 products to
talk about right now also welcome to my
other background the wall I normally
film like in front of the house the
wallpaper is right there and then this
is my desk and then right there I have
like a big dresser that holds houses all
of my makeup collection so you guys will
see and understand a little more when I
do a tour for you guys of this beauty
room umm but yeah I'm just trying to
like help you make sense of it this is
my favorite background though I think
because I just look like the flowers and
the candle and the lamp and the okay
whatever let's move on just a quick
disclaimer number one I'm going to be
using a lot of the same words over and
over and over I do every single year and
people are always making comments about
it you're going to hear the word buttery
and creamy
gasps smooth soft silky amazing
absolutely for some reason I use the
word absolutely when I get excited
absolutely amazing absolutely incredible
so you're gonna hear it accept it deal
with it let's move on also this video is
gonna be really really really long just
letting you know I never get through
these without it being at least 30 to 40
minutes so pause me right now and go
grab a snack pause me oh wait right here
I'll be patient
so just like every year we're going to
start off with primers and then
foundations kind of in the order that we
apply things to the face because it
helps me stay organized because this can
be a tad overwhelming
so the first primers that came to mind
for 2015 for sure we're than make up
forevers skin equalizer primers they
came out with an entire line this year
of primers I think it was 10 different
ones from everything oil control pores
mattifying hydrating moisturizing me
like everything you can think of they
came out with it but these two in
particular have been my favorites this
one right here is the smoothing primer
which is going to be similar to like a
benefit Porefessional like a dr. brandt
pores no more smashbox has one it just
hasn't that kind of silicone ii feel and
it really goes in and fills in the pores
this one right here this is for radiance
so it has a yellow tone in it that's
going to kind of help give the skin
radiance it doesn't have any shimmer in
it though but it just feels really nice
on the skin if you are dry and looking
for radiance I will say this one is the
one I really see a difference more than
anything this one I feel a difference
this one my skin feels more moisturize
this one my skin actually looks like the
pores have been erased and mattified the
next one I love this primer so much it
has a strange name it's the Becca
backlight priming filter I love this
primer so much so this really does have
a do eNOS in it it really is light
reflecting which I love it reminds me a
lot of the L'Oreal one from the
drugstore but just nicer so you can see
on the back of the hand in the
summertime like late summer I would wear
this on days where I didn't wear any
makeup whatsoever and I would just put
this on like a small pump and I'll just
rub it around on my cheek area and it
would just look really really natural
and it kind of smooths over the skin
while giving like that radiant beam and
I love that it's not too pink it's not
too bronze and it's not too white it's
like a nice neutral sheen it's just so
so good at hydrating on my skin so I use
this every way you could think of this
year I used as a primer I use it mixed
in with my foundation I use it by itself
I used it solely on the cheeks you can
put this over top of your foundation
it's just such a good luminous primer
it's my favorite luminous primer I've
ever tried if I'm not mistaken last
primer I have is the Smashbox
photo-finish priming water this is
actually
second bottle because I went through the
entire first one this year I love this
primer now let me let me say I don't
even know if this helps with the
longevity of your makeup I don't know if
this actually keeps it on longer I just
know that someone who is dry like myself
when I spray this on my face I just like
the way my makeup applies better and I
like the way it looks better because it
looks nice and moisturized so that's
what I love about this but I can't stay
here and say this makes my makeup last
all day but it just makes my skin feel
so great because I am dry I don't have a
problem with my makeup leaving so I'm
not really the person to sit here and
tell you the best primers are for my
makeup stain but my makeup since I'm dry
it doesn't fade it's just like this is
not a primer but because it's a spray I
figured I would mention it in this
category this is the tatcha luminous
dewy skin mist this is such a good skin
miss this is my second bottle and you
can see I've already like halfway done
almost I love this stuff so much again I
use this in every way I will spray this
on my face on days where I'm not wearing
makeup I will spray this on my face
before I'm using my foundation I will
face on my face over top of my
foundation like I use this in every way
possible I have tried every dewy if you
could see my pile of dewy skin miss out
and I still have never found anything as
amazing as this it is like the best
luminous dewy skin spray in the world so
much I feel like once I talk about
something I need to put it on the ground
like I'm done with you we can move on
so the first foundation is this Dior
nude air serum foundation it's a serum
so it reminded me a little bit of the
bare minerals bare skin foundation but
that one I have like an allergic
reaction to it's just so sheer like a
serum it just looks so beautiful I got
so many people addicted to this and I
would really recommend this for mature
skin so if you're like 40s and 50s and
60s and you're looking for a really
great foundation it's not going to
crease and fine lines and build up this
is absolutely gorgeous this foundation
oh my god I have to say I think that
this is like the number one foundation
of all 2015 for me that really really
stuck out I will say right now that if I
was still doing freelance work this
would be the foundation that I would
have
my kit in every single color for all of
my brides and clients because this
foundation is absolutely gorgeous and
it's one of those foundations it's going
to work for people who are dry normal
and oily skin it's just gorgeous so this
is the LC a micro finished foundation as
I was called micro silk foundation
makeup by Lillet who is amazing makeup
artist she created this which is what I
love because I love when makeup artists
create makeup like Natasha Venona and
Charlotte Tilbury and now Lillet because
they're working on all different skins
and they know what people are looking
for so it's absolutely gorgeous I
personally use like a dewy mist or like
fix+ and I spray my face to get us a
little bit more of a dewy finish because
it is a natural matte it's kind of like
velvet on the skin it's just gorgeous
you guys have heard me rave about this a
million times it's just so beautiful
it's a medium to full coverage it's
buildable it doesn't sit and find lines
it's just freaking bomb it's my number
one of the year this one is gorgeous
this is the Bourjois healthy mix serum
foundation I'm sorry my throat hmm I've
had allergies recently me and John like
struggling anyways this is the gel
foundation it says it is a 16-hour
radiant boosting even revived complexion
foundation I think I actually bought
this on ASOS calm which is so random
right but such a beautiful foundation I
love that it's gel the way it applies it
feels like a moisturizer like it feels
like you mix your foundation with like
your favorite creamy moisturizer and it
just looks so gorgeous on the skin the
way it blends out this is my favorite I
would say dated a kind of natural
looking foundation like if I want to do
a really really natural look just like
foundation a touch of concealer of
mascara this will be the foundation that
I would grab because it just looks so
natural on the skin I absolutely love
that another foundation you guys I have
a lot this is the year foundations I
swear this is the cover FX natural
finish oil-free foundation I know I read
about this one a lot too but what I love
about this foundation is that it is so
highly full coverage while still
remaining creamy and moisturizing and
hydrating I feel like a lot of times
full full coverages are like a Mac
Studio Fix that dry matte and are just
like and my skin can't breathe I'm like
oh god this is like a
hydrating moisturizing high coverage and
this right here is a foundation that
like you get every penny worth of your
money because the tiniest little
pea-sized drop goes the longest way like
it is it is a really really good
foundation this is another one that
sticks out from there this is another
one that like this and the LCDs are like
my stand out foundations and this is the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD this is what
I'm wearing today I just draw like two
lines on my cheek a lot of my forehead
and then I blend it out it is full
covered as can be and it is so hydrating
and just looks dewy but yet natural I
absolutely love it like I would say if
you are looking for a hydrating full
coverage foundation that I would try
this one first and then the cover of X
but this one is so great because it's
like so small and like easy to travel
and throw on your back like this is the
foundation that I'll take to me take
with me when I go out of town because
it's just so easy and it's just it's
beautiful it's so good everyone talks
about it like I feel like every time I
watch a YouTube video someone is talking
about that foundation because it's just
so good last but not least four
foundations what we are going through
these foundation said oh my gosh this is
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion I
discovered this in December so this was
the very last foundation of 2015 for me
to fall in love with but oh my gosh I
had to mention it because my love for
this is very very strong I've used this
probably 10 times now and it's just
quickly become one of my ass with it
this is hands-down my most favorite
drugstore foundation of all time it is
so beautiful to apply another way I've
been applying it recently is with my
Beauty Blender I like put a little
beauty blender in there and just
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo and it just looks so
natural it just makes your skin look so
natural and just beautiful and radiant
and it's and is from the drugstore it's
amazing
one of my number one foundation I have
two concealers from New York 2015 only
to because I'm a picky little biotch
when it comes to concealers and the
first one of course is the naked skin a
by Urban Decay this is the weightless
complete coverage concealer I don't even
know how to describe this other than its
perfection try for yourself its
perfection if the best concealer I think
is my favorite concealer this is my
favorite concealer even the more than
the next
talk about this is my favorite concealer
like no matter what your ages no matter
no matter your walk of life this
concealer is going to work for you like
I don't see how it couldn't the second
one is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
invisible concealer and this one I've
been raving about recently I absolutely
love it the only thing about this is it
has a pro and a con in the sense that it
is so thick and so creamy that if you
just go a little overboard it's going to
be a crazy disaster you really have to
like use just the tiniest amount which
is awesome because you really get your
bang for your buck because you've used
such a small amount but if you go a
little heavy-handed you will get Creasy
under your eyes but it's amazing if you
are a makeup artist again this is what I
would have in my kit for sure because
such a small amount goes a long way and
you can keep it nice and santoor
sanatory sanitary with the squeeze tube
so absolutely love this and i have all
different undertones red yellows which
is awesome they always cater to the
professional artist which I love about
makeup forever
why is it getting dark out I am NOT
appreciating this okay so I just close
my blinds behind me because I just felt
like it was getting dark out there and
just I don't know if you like see
reflection of the lights and everything
I don't want to be distracting so
hopefully the lighting is still good
okay so now let's talk about eyes
shadows I'm going to show you my
favorite palettes of these so the number
one palette that I just have nothing bad
to say about is this Kat Von D shade
light eyeshadow palette oh my god so
gorgeous this might actually be my
favorite palette of all time because the
fact that two neutrals it has cools it
has warms it has grays it has vanilla it
has a peach it has it all like this this
grey right here don't get me started
this is the best transition color in the
cool tone family of all time the black
is like the ink iasts
blackest black it's amazing this does
have a little bit of fallout but
whatever follow happens you know I feel
like I used to be so kicking about
fallout and I'm like whatever it's just
beautiful it's a beautiful range of
neutrals you can use every shadow in
here I love that they did not put this
pop of crazy color so many times in
palce you'll see like a palette like
this with like a pop of blue and you're
like why I love it they just like gave
us the neutrals such a good palette okay
so next I have
palates by advised are these pallets are
so great you guys and I love it they're
small they're compact the quality the
eyeshadow was amazing I wasn't packaging
itself
I ate it couldn't prove for the price
these are like 50 bucks apiece they ice
the puppies but they're really really
beautiful I bought these because my
friend recommendation and she was
absolutely right they're gorgeous
and this is 0-1 neutral mat if you have
the kat von d palette you probably don't
need this but of course we're you're
still gonna want it because that's what
we do is women we're like color right
they're just gorgeous as you can see
it's all matte which I just love I love
an all matte palette I think it's
gorgeous
and it's got a range of neutrals it's
got some cool tones warm tones neutral
tones it's just beautiful and this one
right here this is zero for dark mattes
and this is like this is everything look
at this palette or just I absolutely
love this purple shade I love this
tangerine these three like burnt ready
orgies oh so good I haven't even touched
the bottom row I'm not gonna lie but all
of these right here mm-hmm
they're good so these next palettes are
very expensive and I went back and forth
with myself like should I talk about
those should I talk about them and I'm
like yes there are so many of you
they're always asking me to do more
looks with these palettes but they're
just so expensive that like I don't know
it just seems like unobtainable like I
wouldn't have ever been able to buy this
up until the last couple of years and I
wouldn't have it would've been something
I would have baked for for Christmas and
hope that like my family got it for me
but anyway so if you guys follow me on
snapchat I was snapping about these
pallets for like 24 hours because going
back and forth like should I get it
should I not get it and for the majority
most of you guys were like yes get it
tell us how they are take over the team
and also got a my so these are the
Natasha the Nona palettes they're all
white on the outside you can see her
name like right there
Natasha Donora is a professional world
renowned makeup artist and she created
these shadows they are absolutely
gorgeous these palettes are two hundred
and forty dollars a piece I know you
guys are probably back but here's the
thing she also sells her shadows
individually and she also sells them in
like um five packs and then she also
as hold on hold the phone hold the phone
and then she also has like these guys
right here like this so you can't
customize them like they're pre-made
which would be badass you could
customize them but you can do it that
way so it's not like if you want to try
our chato's this is the only option is
to buy this huge palette you can get you
know them individually but they are $40
a piece individuals so when you think
about it that way
it definitely justifies the purchase of
$240 for all of these we can justify
anything that's what we do we are women
so this one right here this is the more
cool tone palette if you will it's so
beautiful you guys these colors are so
payments like let me grab like this
antiquey like red shade right there like
are you kidding me these are ridiculous
this little like purpley taupe color is
so gorgeous look that this pigment is
redonkulous and then this one right here
is like the most gorgeous pinky rose
gold right there like do you see this
it's in say even the mattes only by me
like this right like this aqua matte
right here look at how fit into these
are are you joking yeah so that's how I
justify the money for this palette it's
incredible and so there are two of them
so beautiful so absolutely gorgeous they
are so pigmented this color right here
is like this like dark green with like
brown undertones hmm so beautiful so
yeah I absolutely love these shadows
they're gorgeous and that's all I have
to say they're freaking gorgeous they're
like some of the best shadows I've ever
used I will say though these shadows do
have a lot of Fallout but that's kind of
the price you pay when you have such
crazy pigmented eyeshadows I mean I used
to be really picky about fallout I dig I
don't know and my eyeshadow and then I
realize like I'm being way too
high-maintenance and judgmental towards
these shadows like if they're high
pigment there's pretty much not what you
can do I realized that recently when you
have a high pigment shadow it's pretty
much impossible not to have fallout so
that's the price be pipe okay last but
not least I absolutely have to mention
half dimension the 3/5 oh because this
is still one of my favorite go-to
palette this is a new one that I've only
used once my other one I cracked it I
dropped it on the floor from my stairs
and the
it it was a mess anyway so this is a new
one that I've only used once so far but
then morphe 35o palette is a standout
palette for me in the Year 2015 it's
just gorgeous it's all warms it's a
mixture of mattes and shimmers so crazy
pigmented like just for morphe like they
have stepped up their game you see this
you see it a hot yeah
and absolutely gorgeous like look at
this one right here this one looks so
much like makeup geek flamethrower like
oh look at the pigment in these look at
that gorgeous okay I gotta go wash my
hand and I've left my hair because it
was looking very flat and now it's gonna
be like ba-ba-boom and within three
minutes it's gonna get man as far as my
favorite single eyeshadows in the year
2015 and not just palettes this right
here is my go-to palette there is a huge
request for me to make a video all about
this so I will be filming that in the
next couple of weeks for you guys in the
meantime I'm not going to go through
these right now that's I'm gonna save
that for the video but these right here
where my go-to shades for 2015 a lot of
masks a lot of neutrals these are my
favorite pops of colors down here but
I'm going to go through this entire
thing for you guys very soon so just
stay tuned but as far as eyes go I will
mention my number one favorite lashes in
the year of 2015 I discover or any House
of lashes iconic lashes oh my gosh I
know these have been available for quite
some time and I just discovered them I
was brand new to the bandwagon of these
lashes but I absolutely love them I
think I can put these on with every look
rain or shine day or night I can rock an
iconic I absolutely love these lashes
they are definitely a statement lash
there and got a natural lash if you have
very small eyes you're probably not
gonna like these but they're like Vava
voom they're spiky they kind of winged
out they are just so much fun so I love
me some iconic so in 2015 the lower
lashes came out with their silk lash
line for Sephora oh my god these lashes
are so gorgeous these are my favorite
silk lashes ever like I love me flashes
because they're just so fluffy they look
so natural just Vava voom but they
really conquered the exact same look
with silk which is I feel like it's
never been done before I haven't seen so
clashes as gorgeous as these and my
favorite two styles are fluff and edgy
which are these right here and it's also
what I'm wearing today they're kind of a
more subtle natural lash even though
a lot people would still think these are
dramatic but I think it's a great place
to start and they're nice and fluffy and
then this one is called fluff and wispy
and these are very viable every time I
wear these people are asking me where my
eyelashes are from because they're
definitely a statement lash they're
gorgeous so those are my two thieves
right there let's move this over okay
well now we're going to go through face
and we're gonna go through lips and then
we're done
we have powder bronzer blush and
highlights so I'll start off with powder
this power definitely stands out to me
for the year of 2015 this is the Laura
Mercier translucent powder so balm I
know that I mentioned in my December
favorites I said I'm so done with this
powder and when I said that I was
referring to that way I was using it I
was referring to I'm so done studying my
whole face with this powder I was not
saying in general
I'm done with this I love this powder
and I still use it every day I
personally use this power to bake I use
this too it cut out my contour right
here and mattify the section make it
look nice and smooth and airbrushed if
you are oily whatsoever buy this powder
you are not going to regret it so if
you're Whaley that is such a beautiful
powder to set your face with but I am
dry so I use it now just to bake and
smooth out the skin but not to set my
entire face as far as bronzing and
contouring though I have a few different
favorites again I have to give a shout
out to Kat Von D I feel like it was Kat
Von D's year like 2015 Kat Von D
cosmetics just it's like Kat Von D
takeover I feel the same way kind of by
anastasiya too but she did so many
amazing things this year and this is the
shade and light palette for the face and
it is just everything so I have two of
these palettes because I literally went
through this color and the other one so
I bought a second one because that's how
ride-or-die and committed I am to this
but I'm so excited because she said that
she is now going to be coming out with
refillable pans like magnetic pans I'm
like I love it when brands listen to the
consumer because like who
one that like I cannot wait I cannot
wait I'm so excited but anyways this
contour color right here and this
highlight color everything now even
though I love this not everyone is gonna
love this color but that's what's so
genius about this is you have three
different shapes so like my sister if
she was going to use this palette she
would use this as I use this and if
you're darker you would use the peachy
one that's what's so genius about this
but this middle color right here is my
favorite contour I can say of all time
but my one of my favorites of the year
it's just beautiful it's the perfect
neutral from my skin tone this one is a
little bit too gray on me and it's more
a little bit too dark but this middle
one is just gorgeous another one that
really sticks out to me is the shade Sur
sculpting powder by Mac now this was a
limited edition like collection this
came out in but this is a pro product so
just like the Mac Pro emphasized I
always used to set my under eye area
that's like the little round magnetic
magnetic magnet get it together you can
get this in the exact same thing you can
get this at a Mac Pro store or Mac
online I believe it's just called shade
stir sculpting powder and you can get it
in a little magnetic refill and just pop
it into a palette this I have to say I
think is my absolute favorite contour
color of all time I think this one's
number one from my skin specifically
because it is pretty neutral but it has
like a hint of that kind of caramel
color in it where it's not too great
it's just my absolute favorite I love it
so as far as bronzers go I have two from
this year that really stand out to me so
the first one is the Make Up For Ever
bronzer and this is technically oh it's
an ultra natural and waterproof bronzer
I do not know so you could wear this if
he's going to take you swimming on that
first date mm-hmm screw him adjust this
bronzer in general it's just so
beautiful it's so natural and the way it
feels it feels like a cream like look at
how natural that is on the back of my
hand like it really when you apply it it
is not blotchy you never have to be
afraid of applying too much like you can
apply and apply and apply and apply and
it just like it takes a really really
long time to build it up which I love
with bronzer because it's a very common
mistake to go in with too much bronzer
and then you're like wait a minute how
do I go back you can't you race your
mistakes daddy Bob if you can have like
a makeup eraser oh I wish but anyways
actually gorgeous
and I just found out that it's
waterproof bomb and in my last bronzer
this is to face dark chocolate Soleil so
there's the milk chocolate and this is a
dark chocolate and I really really love
this I discovered this this year and I
really fell in love with that and gets a
gorgeous bronzer again it's got a little
bit of like that honey kind of caramel
vibe in it so it's not too grey because
some people look amazing in grey
bronzers which is why they make bronzers
that are more cool tone gray I do not I
look much better in a warmer bronzer I
look muddy and ashy very quickly so I
always have to have a little bit like
that honey
warmth in my bronzer and I just love
this one not to mention it smells like
chocolate okay so now for blushes I
probably mentioned these the last year
favorites but I have to mention I can or
the becca blushes because becca blushes
are my favorite blushes i think ever to
be honest if you were to ask me what's
your favorite formulation of blushes of
all time the first thing that comes to
mind is becca i think they are so creamy
so pigmented and so blendable like when
i touch them I'm just like yes I can
close my eyes and touch these blushes
and I just know like that's magic
so my three favorite colors for this
year was flower child which is like this
gorgeous pink shade that has a little
bit of shimmer in it it's just so
gorgeous and then this one right here is
songbird looks like this this one was
what I was obsessed with in the
summertime it's got like this kind of
bronzy meets rosy like a color is so
good and then this last one right here
this is sweet pea and I use this a lot
when I'm just looking for a nice basic
neutral blush which is right there it's
just like that perfect blush for every
day it goes with almost every look if
you're not waiting to be specific and
match your blush perfectly it's a great
color right there and that's sweet pea
so I'm not going to lie once this
palette came out I use this for months
like you can see the indents in my
favorite colors this is the morphe 9b
blush palette it's also getting a swatch
so you can see how actually pigmented
these are so you know like I'm not lying
to you so this is like a full Matt rose
shade like look at how beautiful they're
just gorgeous like this is my go
- palate when I travel this is all I
take I just take it just like this I
don't take any other blushes when I
travel I just take this one because it's
got everything you need it's got nine
different blush shades it's beautiful
this would be great for someone having
their kids because it's just such a nice
blush palette for so inexpensive - okay
so let's move on to highlighters and
illuminator so when it comes to
highlighters you guys I'm not gonna lie
I don't have many because let's get real
this was the year of champagne pop for
me I mean I got my first sample of
champagne pop in February 2015 and I was
wearing this from February to June
off-camera almost every day and I
started wearing it on camera when I
announced it in July I believe oh my god
like this is it's my favorite
highlighter of all time obviously like
I'm a little biased um but you know it's
funny that this is not my favorite
highlighter just because I created it I
created it because it was my favorite
highlighter we went through so many
different shades in the process of
champagne pop and this was the one that
I'll like this is the color this is it I
was wearing it for like a month and a
half before I actually came up with the
name and I was like this is just perfect
this is everything I've ever wanted a
highlight so that's why it's my favorite
I just love it so much the next
highlight that I have is Laura Geller
gilded honey and this is a really really
beautiful shade and it's very tiny as
you can see which is good and bad
because of the price but at the same
time it's also easy to throw in your
purse and take with you I will say that
this reminds me so much of Mac whisper
of guilt some of you may remember when
Mac came out with whisper of guilt
they'd come out with a couple times
collections if Mac did it right they
would just keep that product permanent
cuz it's so beautiful it's very similar
to this and honestly I still have Mac
whispered Gil and I swatch them next to
each other on the back of my hand and
they're honestly like the same formula
and pretty much the exact same color
they both have like that kind of wetness
feel to them like SLR heatwave Mac extra
dimension skin finish and now laura
geller gilded honey so a really really
beautiful highlight it looks worse on
really really bronzed skin it's like
just gold absolutely loved loved this
compact this year and this is the bobbi
brown shimmer brick in the shade pink
I'm really excited to start using this
again in the spring because I think it's
such a gorgeous spring highlight
so let me swatch it for you guys you can
see what it looks like it just having
that gorgeous vanilla pink undertone in
it it's just so beautiful for the
springtime like wearing like some light
baby pink blush and kind of dusting out
over top just so radiant and gorgeous
and like the girl-next-door look like I
absolutely love it so this is the Bobbi
Brown shimmer brick in pink I use this
palette like crazy this year and this is
the hourglass ambient lighting palette
you can see it's like so dirty from me
using it I love these shades so much so
in the summertime when I was really
looking for like that do we highlighted
goddess look I was taking like these two
colors and mixing them and lightly
dusting them underneath my entire eye
area because of the fact they're not
like shimmery but they're more of like
this just really beautiful Sheen like
you even see it but they're gorgeous
okay I use this all year long I just
think that they're so beautiful and
along with that the ambient lighting
powder in the shade luminous light I've
said it a million times if you are a
bride this is your baby this is like the
most beautiful bridal glow of all time
it's one of my favorite highlights
because it's just so natural
again you're not maybe you'll see it it
just I used it in my Bridal tutorial I
believe if you guys aren't checking out
their I've used it in many many many
videos it's just such a gorgeous
natural-looking highlight I've got a lot
of the older women in my family using
this because it just looks so gorgeous
on mature skin as a post like a normal
highlight can look a little chunky and
crepey on older more mature skin but
this does not it just looks gorgeous so
I love this highlight so much I love
this palette so much I just need an
hourglass like there ambient lighting
powders are so different from anything
else in like the highlighting portion of
cosmetics right so now we just have lips
to cover which sounds so easy right but
I have a lot of lip products I talked
about so in the year 2015 I discovered
my absolute favorite lip gloss formula
of all time I'm obsessive these up
losses to say the least and these are
the Marc Jacobs lip glosses they came
out with this lip gloss line this year
and
I am just absolutely obsessed they are
so smooth so creamy they feel like lip
balm like a butter on the lips I'm
wearing one right now I am wearing sugar
sugar which is like my favorite and
neutral gloss of all time it has a minty
scent but it doesn't feel minty or
tingling on the lips which is so nice
their pigment Simba they're not too
pigmented and they're still glossy and
they give you like that nice wet lip
look I love them so much sugar sugar
my favorite neutral ever if you're
really really fair Moonglow would be
gorgeous moon glow on me is like
definitely like powdered sugar doughnut
which I mean I'm not totally against but
still I actually love this color and
this is called love bud and it has a
shimmer in it which is funny because
I've never really been a shimmery gloss
girl but all of a sudden hey you can
barely see that all of a sudden just the
past couple of like month or two I've
really been into shimmery glosses so I
feel like sharing glosses are making a
comeback right now I just think that
they're worth every penny because they
are just so high-quality I love the
packaging I love the way they feel your
lips I just love everything about them
they're my favorite loss formula that
I've ever tried honest to god I'm just
so happy that I discovered these but
they're just they complete me another
gloss that came out this year was the
Anastasio Beverly Hills glosses and I
love these as well even though they are
completely different from the Marc
Jacobs glosses so if you have our Jacobs
glosses don't feel like you don't need
the Anastacio because they are totally
opposite as far as the way they feel and
the way they look these are very high
pigmented like very high pigmented not
as glossy but I love that as well this
shade right here is Kristin this is a
really gorgeous neutral kind of Bobby
purpley brown shade so were different
but dainty which is this shade right
here I wore this a lot in 2015 because
it's just such a beautiful like baby
pinky nude shade undressed this is a
color that I will go in with on top of a
lipstick when I want to nude it out so
it's a very very nude shade and I will
apply that if my color of my lipstick is
a little too much I'll apply this over
top these are not sticky they smell
amazing they smell like a cake to me
which I love
and they're just gorgeous they're super
high pigment
so it's really funny but I only have two
different lipstick brands to show you
guys I feel like no one came out with
lipsticks this year
which made me very sad because even
though this was like the year of liquid
lips I feel like I like liquid lips yes
but overall I'm a gloss and a lipstick
girl and I'm like whatever happened to
just a good old lipstick like I feel
like lipsticks never go out of style lip
says are my favorite lip product
lipsticks and then gloss and then a lip
paint anyways this is the brand house of
dolls was created by Natalie she is also
a youtuber and Instagram and all that
jazz and she created this lipstick line
I believe it's four colors and she also
came out some lip liners this color in
the shade she was one of my favorite
nude I actually went through the first
one but it was down to a nub and then it
broke off so I got a second one it's
this beautiful beautiful neutral light
pink color I love it so much that her
lipsticks like remind me of something as
a child when I drive me crazy and I
can't think of what it is but it smells
so good next is appeal cosmetics I
mentioned these lipsticks in my video
and my August favorites I think there's
two shades by them that I just love this
first one right here is the shade
mock-up this is the color that I
mentioned in my video it's just such a
high pigmented creamy neutral shade it's
just gorgeous
and then the next one is naked and naked
is more of a peachy neutral but they're
just it's so random right like I don't
even know where this brand is from I was
at I'm at back in January I don't
remember I don't know which I'm at I was
at but someone literally just walked up
to me and was like here you go I just
like handed to me and like this little
goodie bag and I was it oh thanks and
then months later I found that little
bag and I tried to rels like love it
like these are so so so beautiful I will
say the packaging feels a little cheap
I'm not gonna lie not redeeming feels a
little cheap and that's why I was kind
of like apprehensive to trying and then
once I tried out like oh there's nothing
cheap about these these are so nice okay
so colour-pop lippie stix oh I fell in
love with these products this year the
colour-pop lippie stix are very
inexpensive they are high-quality and so
the cream ones I
so they love I have some glossy ones in
here and I have three mats in here so
these are my favorite colors and let me
just quickly tell you what they are I'm
going to try to go through this as fast
as possible
this one right here is crunch it's like
a really nice coral shade I use this one
a lot in the summer time this one is
last call which is a really nice like
purplish kind of medium lobby tone shade
really pretty and that one is more
glossy oh snap this is a matte and it is
a more of a like brown tone nude but you
know me I love my nudes you notice how
I'm not showing any brights Lumiere this
is Kathleen light shade this is gorgeous
it's like that purpley mami shade that
was so popular in a year cookie oh I
love this color so much I need to start
using this again it's like a nice kind
of Brown neutral shade cake I wore this
a ton in the summer because it's so high
pigmented and it's like that gorgeous
vibrant coral shade and this one is
really really glossy and hydrating on
the lips and then this is my absolute
favorite color pop lip you stick hand
down and this is the shade bound I've
used this one so much that when I roll
it down I'm almost out of it I barely
have any left but this is just such a
gorgeous
pinky neutral nude okay so now for
liquid lipsticks my favourites of the
year Jeffrey's are liquid lipsticks are
definitely one of my favorite liquid lip
formulas for sure they are not too mu
see they're not too thick they're not
too chunky they're not too dry and
drogyny is my favorite color by him but
I don't have that right now it's at my
in my purse at my house because I'm
using so much um this one right here is
called celebrity skin this one's more
sheer than his other formulas but
whenever I wear this it truly is like
the perfect neutral color ever it's not
too pale it's not too Brown it just
looks like my lips
it's a gorgeous shape Kat Von D Lolita
oh my god I wore this for like three
months trait like I was
this every single day like even if I was
barely wearing any makeup I was still
wearing Lolita it's very similar to like
androgyny by jeffrey star that kind of
brownish purple knobby shade that we saw
all year long it's just such a beautiful
shade and then oprah cosmetics and
kathleenlights teamed up to create
Havana nights I will say this is one of
my absolute favorite lipstick formulas
and colors kathleenlights did so bomb on
this it's like the color of blood and
it's so moisturizing especially if you
put a light coat of a lip balm on and
then apply this your lips stay
moisturized all day long I don't know
how they make this work but this liquid
lipstick is different than anything else
that I've ever used it's so moisturizing
it's actually insane it baffles my mind
I don't understand how it looks so good
all day long so last but not least we
have the Anastasia Beverly Hills liquid
lipsticks I do not know if these came
out in the beginning of 2015 or the end
of 2014 I feel like it was 14 honestly
now that I'm thinking about it and I
might have mentioned these in my last
favorites last year but oh well oh well
these are these are good liquid
lipsticks I will say that sometimes they
can be a little chunky they can be a
little moosie um but I really do like
them I feel like there might go to the
kwid lip because she has such a wide
right and she has like every color you
can think of in this formula 3 shades I
really love throughout the year and the
first one is a shade Heather's I'm
actually missing trust issues trust
issues is when my favorite shades too
and I cannot find it anywhere it's been
gone like a month but Heather's is right
here and then we have Veronica Veronica
is gorgeous I wore this several times
which it's funny you can see like I kind
of have a pattern of colors that I like
this is Lolita right here and then this
one underneath is Veronica so they're
similar but yet very different and then
craft crafts I loved in the summer time
it's such a pretty a raspberry shade
like that is a good red berry shade
right there so I also love the shade
trust issues but I can't find it I do
not know where it's been been gone like
a whole month I cannot locate it
anywhere it completes this video if you
are still here you've made it to the end
