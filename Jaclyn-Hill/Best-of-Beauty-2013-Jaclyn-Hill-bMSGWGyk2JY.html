trying to color adjust it the best I can
and editing so just work with me please
so hopefully I can get through this
without going crazy or having a nervous
breakdown this week has just been to say
the least
I need to sit a hot bubble bath and
drink a cup of tea and just like inject
myself with vitamins I was going to put
skincare I was thinking about like doing
skincare and beauty like a whole
products video and once I start going
for skincare I like
mm I have too much of a skincare junkie
to mix skincare and makeup in the same
video it was turning into like 300
products so I did tweet about it and a
lot of you guys said to do a separate
skincare video so let me know in the
comments down below if you do want to
see a favorite skincare of 2013 because
girl I've got a lot of it first thing
I'm going to talk about is foundations I
have 4 foundations from this year that I
was absolutely in love with and the
first one is my tried and trued L'Oreal
True Match Lumi now there is the
original Oriole True Match but this is
the loonie one which is supposed to give
you more of a luminous dewy finish I
absolutely love this foundation I was in
between shade w5 and w6 pretty much the
entire year I haven't used this now
actually in about 3 months but this will
forever be one of my favorites not to
mention it's drugstore so the price is
right it's absolutely gorgeous and it's
also going to work on people who are
learning or combination skin if you're
truly oily you're not going to love this
but it is just beautiful it doesn't make
you look like you're wet or extremely
dewy it just has a really nice glow in
it with no glitter it's it's a beautiful
foundation my favorite drugstore
foundation for sure
YSL - chic law foundation I have used
mine so much that you can't even see
anymore there used to be gold lettering
all over this and it's like completely
worn off I am in shade b40 and this is
such a luxurious foundation I love the
smell it just smells like YSL something
that they would make I absolutely love
this it is a medium to full coverage and
it does have a luminous finish to it
again with no glitter or shimmer in it
it just looks so natural when I first
bought this I was shocked I really did
think that this was the best foundation
I have ever tried in my entire life I
got compliments in my skin
everywhere I went but it's like once you
get used to a foundation you then want
better so I'm used to this one now but
when I first used it I was just shocked
by how glamorous it was and everyone
slimy how gorgeous it looks and this is
definitely a foundation that would
recommend for mature skin as well
especially if you're having any issues
with dryness this is very hydrating
absolutely beautiful
again if you're very oily you're not
going to like this foundation but anyone
else dry normal combination you will
definitely definitely love and
appreciate this formula Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation this foundation
I purchased at Nordstrom when I was
shopping with my sister in April and
this is in shade 5.75 I forgot who I've
heard about this from I remember seeing
it on some celebrity and thinking oh my
gosh it was so beautiful and so I had to
go Nordstrom and pick it up for myself
I've been obsessed ever since
the tiniest bit goes the longest way
like I said I did purchased this in
April and I have not run out yet I don't
know how much is in it exactly because
it never really settles down in the
bottle but absolute beautiful again this
one is similar to the YSL where it looks
like skin this one is a little bit more
matte then this one even though this is
called luminous silk foundation it still
is not super super dewy it's like I
would say it's more of a natural
coverage but it gives such a beautiful
glow which is it's gorgeous and I really
don't think that anybody would try this
and not like it it's beautiful and I'm
sure or someone oily could do this I
would totally be comfortable putting
this on an oily skin person as long as I
didn't set with powder absolute or just
the big deal for me this year because I
finally found out my color and the NARS
sheer glow foundation I have been trying
to figure out my gap color for oh my
gosh it's almost been two years and I am
in a shady Punjab so medium one Punjab
which is really awesome that I finally
found my color so yes actually love this
it is a medium coverage it's called
sheer glow but I would still consider it
medium and this one is very dewy I
absolutely love this one it is so
beautiful especially for us dry skin
girls and like during the winter months
like right now this is like my go-to
found
because it makes me hello Dewey I only
have two concealers this year that I was
truly in love with all year long and
number one how many times you guys heard
this mac prolongwear concealer oh my god
duh I'm in shade nw20 and I have
literally been using this ever since the
day it came out technically before it
came out
when I was working at Mac this came out
and I have not put it down ever since it
is my go-to concealer I use this like 8
out of 10 times I conceal my face
absolutely love pro longwear concealer
if you do not have Mac Pro Longwear
concealer go get it if you don't want to
spend the money go get it if you can
find any other excuses I don't care go
get it this is the best concealer in the
entire world amazing NARS radiant creamy
concealer I finally fell in love with
this just a couple months ago maybe four
or five months ago anyways absolutely
love it I purchased it at the very
beginning of the year when it first came
out and I didn't like it because I I
don't know why I just felt like it was
too mu C it wasn't working but I also
did apply it while I was at work and
kind of just messing around with it and
then when I actually like bought it
actually gave it a chance
absolutely love it it's more sheer than
the pro longwear concealer it is what
I'm wearing today
now that really makes a difference I
just love it I absolutely love it
especially if you're doing like tinted
moisturizer and you still need to
conceal I'll recommend something like
this over the pro longwear because the
pro long is completely full coverage
where this is more of a sheer to medium
coverage depending how you apply it it
does have this little tip like so so if
you put it on and kind of spread it out
it will go on more sheer or if you
really like pack it on you can get full
coverage depending how you choose to
apply I feel like I have to mention
these because I have been in a serious
committed relationship with them now for
a few years and they are the Mac prep
and prime high
are in radiant rose and light boost one
is more of a green yellow and one is
more of a peachy pink and they are used
for color correcting color adjusting and
highlighting so there's different
reasons to use the pink and different
reasons to use the yellow I've explained
that in some of my videos before I did
talk about that more in depth in my
cream highlighting and contouring video
so yes I actually love these I've been
using them for oh my gosh it's been
almost four years now since these came
out that I have just been loving them I
go through different cream highlighters
and concealers that these always always
are my absolute favorite love these I
forgot to mention I should have talked
about this first since it is the first
thing to go on the skin but I am not
much of a primer person but I will say
that this benefit states while this 15
hour primer was definitely a love of
mine this year it takes a lot and a
primer to impress me I have tried so
many of them it feels like hundreds and
I always just like I don't need it I
just don't need it for some reason my
skin does not require primer or for my
foundation to stay there look any better
but this a flawless I really really did
like this it really did keep my
foundation like not moving not budging
and it kept on for hours and hours and
hours without changing at all so I
really did appreciate this primer the
only thing is that this is broken
like it just falls out and I've had a
lot of people tell me that there's the
same thing and I was like oh that's
weird mine didn't do it and then one day
it just fell out how's it oh it happens
but yeah I do like this primer a lot I
only have one powder to mention since I
am dry I don't use powder foundations
and I rarely use powder on my face but
the only one I do use I finally discover
this year is the bare minerals original
loose powder foundation this one does
have a luminosity in it with some glow
which is why I love it so much I only
use it to set my t-zone in between my
eyebrows and my nose and that's it
because I do make so many facial
expressions and my
the foundation will tend to kind of move
around in this area and kind of settle
in little lines so when I use this it
doesn't do that so I absolutely love
this because of the luminosity in it and
so the lab I found it this year okay
we're going to move on to the face so
blushes and highlighters and I don't
know which one I wanna do first blushes
highlighters bronzers lucious
highlighters brother yeah let's do
blushes set got a lot of them oh my god
I'm yellow first one is this Milani
baked blush in the shade alumina so this
is a very popular blush I think it's the
most popular one that Milani makes it
looks like this it is absolutely
gorgeous gorgeous pinky peach with the
perfect amount of shimmer in it it is
baked so it just goes on so smooth and
creamy does not at all feel like a
drugstore blush I have a very hard time
finding nice drugstore blushes that I
truly like because a lot of them can go
on very chalky and streaky this one
absolutely gorgeous I don't think I've
ever even mentioned these next products
on camera before but I love them and
they are the bomb long-wearing blushes I
love the packaging and look how slim it
is and I love how much product you get
even though it's small thin packaging
they are so pigmented truly long wearing
you barely need any of it most of them
are matte I believe I'll show you how
payments and they are right like this
sorry my lighting is going nuts so much
pigment so smooth creamy anyone can wear
these you can get so much lay out of
them so I'm just showing you a few then
that I have this one right here is tule
and then we have this one which is more
like a purpley moi which is how to's
gorgeous for this time of year so
absolutely love these balm blushes these
three blushes right here are all from
the Sigma and light collection we have
mellow peaceful and serene peaceful
right here is a little bit of shimmer in
it it's a beautiful highlight and these
two are matte right here go on so smooth
so creamy you can purchase them
individually or in the collection this
whole collection is right up my alley
it's all neutral warm
and I was so impressed when I got this
collection and let me just say that I
did have the pleasure of working with
Sigma personally this year as you know I
did my meet and greet in Minnesota with
them and I just have to save you guys
you should know that this company is no
joke they are absolutely amazing the
owners are the most like morally correct
people they are such a family they're
they're so loving they're all about
standing for what's right they're just
great people and after I got to meet
them personally I fell in love with the
company I have been using Sigma brushes
since 2009 but I never knew who I was
buying from and I'm here to tell you you
are buying from some of the greatest
people I've met they're so so awesome
and I think that it's important to know
that because there's not a lot of
amazing truly honest people out there
anymore and they are definitely those
people so I love Sigma Beauty I love
your Sigma beauty I let everything they
do so wow I'm like sitting here singing
the praises they're not paying you to
say this I prize I'll put in the
disclaimer in the description box below
this is a blush by Mac it's called Sun
bask I use this a lot this summer
it has shimmer in it and it is a dusty
rose shade it's definitely something
appropriate for summertime it's like a
brownish pink it is really really
beautiful
I loved it this year I owned it for a
couple of years this year I really fell
in love with it again and I used it a
lot two blushes by NARS and that made my
life this year of course every one was
about orgasm so this year I ventured off
and found some other ones that I loved
this one right here is called daydream
absolutely gorgeous caramel two cameras
to keep the color nicely I'll make sure
that it does but it's a really pretty
rosy pink it's got a lot of pigment to
it so so pretty this is a color that's
going to pretty much look good on
everyone it's not too orange it's not
too lavender it's not too peach it's
beautiful beautiful shape this one is
called deep throat
I know this is a little bit more coral
in it than the daydream does this is the
daydream right here this one has more
shimmer and a little bit more peach it
is so beautiful this replace NARS orgasm
blush for me it is just gorgeous and I
love how vibrant and give the cheeks and
the shimmer is just on points it's not
too much it's not too little it's
perfect it's a nice neutral shimmer so
you don't get like crazy gold shimmer oh
my god I'm so yellow again alright this
is a Bobby Brown shimmer brick this
specific one is in the shade nectar it
is a quarterly peach shade you guys are
actually the ones that recommended this
to me and I went to Sephora and they
were like there's no such thing and I
was like you're calling my subscribers
liars but I ended up finding it in
Nordstrom and I actually love this color
I love shimmer Brooks and generally
they're so pretty just rub them together
mix it all up and it comes out with this
gorgeous gorgeous like pale rosy pink
and when you move and light your cheeks
hit all these different shades so
gorgeous and so summery oh my gosh the
shade making this summer so much it's
just a lot in summer look okay next is
highlighters it was very difficult for
me to narrow this down to four
highlighters because I'm a highlighting
freak so I picked the ones that actually
stood out this year for me
so the first one is the Sela all over
shimmer duo in kitten this I use for I
think a month and a half
straight every single day I could not
get enough of it it has one shot that is
more pinky like the shade of the
eyeshadow kitten and this side is a
little bit more bronzy brown so this can
really work for any skin tone as far as
highlighting it's absolutely gorgeous
this side of the pink light highlighter
o-m-g it's right here it is just such a
true beautiful highlight more on the
pink side though so if you are a little
bit more tan and you like more gold
tones then this one would be a better
friend to you right here next door to it
next is hard candy tiki this is a
drugstore product super inexpensive
the so big bronzer is what it's called I
don't know why it's called a bronzer
when it's definitely not going to bronze
you in any way but it's beautiful and
again I layers can be super tricky to
find in the drugstore because a lot of
times they can be really chalky dusty or
extremely glittery with not enough
shimmer this is a very fine shimmer it's
the perfect shade for anyone it's got
just the right amount of bronze antique
mary-lou manizer by the balm
I think everybody's heard this mine like
falls out it came on goose I have to
take hold this kind of tricky absolutely
gorgeous this I have to say is the most
standout highlighter of the year to me I
use it for the first six months pretty
much straight I think it's absolutely
beautiful
it's the perfect shimmer it is intense
you have to use a pretty fluffy brush
when applying this because it goes on
very intensely if you just pick this up
on your brush and go to town on your
cheeks you're going to be so highlighted
that like every single street light is
going to be making it look a disco ball
it is actually beautiful though it's
just like that perfect shape of vanilla
where it's not bronze pink or silver
it's that perfect neutral color if you
do not own a highlighter and you're in
the market this is definitely the one I
would go for beautiful and last but not
least this is my most recent highlighter
loved and this is the Laura Mercier
baked highlighter and shade 0-1 it is
very similar similar to the mary lou
manizer by the balm but it is not as
thick and pigmented which can be nice
sometimes because it's a little bit
harder to go overboard on it so you can
see it right here it's still absolutely
beautiful just like the mary lou manizer
it doesn't have too much silver or too
much pink rose or bronze it's just
gorgeous and neutral highlighter
beautiful I have three bronzers and the
first one is the benefit hoola bronzer
you can see I enjoyed it since I did hit
pan on this shade when I first saw this
bronzer I thought oh my gosh says way to
like mess
that's never going to Mac to me because
at the time I was like a Mac and c35 to
NC 40 I was told no you're crazy
by it it'll work and it's true it did
for some reason the packaging it looks
super light but then when you apply it
it does not look like whatsoever I
really really do like this bronzer
really smooth really creamy not crazy
about the packaging for it but
everything else I really enjoy the
product inside the packaging Bobby Brown
bronzing powder and golden light number
one beautiful bronzer I have to say I
like this the most just for contouring
and getting yourself a nice sharp
definition line in the contour area when
you start to blend this out and actually
try to wrong the cheeks I feel like it
doesn't blend as beautifully as it does
is just give you a nice strict contour
call me crazy too when it comes to
actually blending out this bronzer by
benefit and the next one I like a little
bit better
this one I use typically just for the
contour and that's it but it's a
beautiful beautiful bronzer I love the
shade of it it's a very universal shade
it's got some red and terracotta colors
in it so it's going to go with a lot of
skin tones make it forever matte bronze
and shade 20 this is the newest addition
to my bronzer collection I have been
using this one non-stop for about two
months I think at this point actually
love this creamy easy to blend again
Matt's going to look great on tons of
different skin tones I have nothing at
all bad to say about this out of the
packaging of the whole deal one of my
favorite bronzer also one more product
this is the sole eight and a Chanel
cream bronzer I discovered this product
this year well I heard about it before
this year but I bought it for the first
time this year and it is the most
amazing cream bronzer of life it is so
smooth so silk it goes on beautifully
absolutely gorgeous okay now I'm going
to move on to eyes I do have one two
three four five pallets to talk about
and the first one is this lorac little
black palette I believe it's called it
just has these four shimmery shades in
it and I absolutely love this palette
you obviously do not have
enough colors to do a completed I look
but these four colors are just so
beautiful they have so much pigment and
so much shimmer they're actually
gorgeous you have a champagne a peachy
champagne it's really warm coppery color
and then this dark dark bronzy burgundy
purpley shade they're so pigmented it's
crazy they're so creamy they really do
feel like butter on the skin so easy to
blend I love this palette next is a
palette I did not talk about much on
camera but I did use it often and they
actually don't have this for sale
anymore but you can buy the individual
colors online and it is the resort
palette by Sigma it was a limited
edition palette but I love the colors
inside it comes with a liquid
highlighter I pencil and then a blush
right here and then these colors up here
I posted a picture back in the day doing
a look with this blue and green right
here this purple I love it it's such a
awesome cool tone purple all super easy
to blend fawn luna and topaz are my
favorite of course because i love
neutrals super shimmery I love topaz
it's such a gorgeous warm orangey Brown
fawn right here
such a pretty pewter color it looks like
that gorgeous all over the lid
especially blended out with the warm
round I really like this color so again
you cannot purchase it exact palette but
you can get the individual shades online
lorac Pro palette mine did break this
color right here actually broke on
camera when I was filming my bombshell
tutorial so it's super messy but this
right here is such a beautiful shade all
shimmer on the bottom all matte on the
top if you do not own any palettes or
you're looking for a good basic palette
this is such a perfect be dinners
palette it's got color in it it's got
neutrals in it all the shimmers you need
all the maps you need highlights it's
just it's beautiful so buttery so
beautiful creamy blendable nothing not
to say about this love the lorac pro
another lorac palette wow i did not
realize i
three pallets this is the lorac unzipped
palette this is beautiful it's
definitely more neutral I love that you
have these big square blocks of shadows
it has these gorgeous champagne shades
you have one two three four five shimmer
colors actually six shimmer colors and
then four mattes gorgeous I love how
buttery they are they're so creamy so
blendable they're just yeah they're
gorgeous you can see they've got great
pigmentation I'm going to be talking
about them if they did it
I love these neutral champagne II colors
to put all of the lid and then blend it
out with whatever you prefer kind of
like the look that I'm wearing today so
love lorac unzipped one more palette
this is not a palette that you can
purchase like this this is a palette
that I have built and this is a makeup
geek palette so the palette that it's
sitting in is a Z palette which is the I
believe like the pro size or whatever
it's call just the biggest palette and
then inside is nothing but makeup geek
shadows I have to give a shout-out to
making this video because I purchased
naked peak for the first time in April
and I have been non-stop in love ever
since it's pretty much replaced my Mac
eyeshadows I used to use all the time
it's now make a peak makeup geek make a
peak I love these shadows they're
basically the exact same as Mac they
feel like the exact same formula they
blend out the same they go on the same
but they're literally half the price of
not less than half the price um
absolutely beautiful absolutely gorgeous
I have another palette of makeup big
with a few more shadows in it
they're just they're amazing Marlena did
an awesome awesome job in creating these
she should be so proud of herself so I
don't have to talk about these you guys
know you watch my tutorials you know how
much I
be so they're also I also fell in love
with Bobby Brown shadow this year I have
two of them right here I have camel and
I have toast I love them the thing about
Bobby Brown is they don't have tons of
shades that I'm really drawn to but the
formula themselves actually gorgeous so
I love them I love that you get a big
block of it it's not a tiny little
shadow you definitely get more product
for the price so I really really like
these the formulas beautiful blends out
gorgeously the mats are just a really
nice buttery matte they're not chalky or
dusty so Bobby Brown shadows for the win
this makeup forever shadow and number
162 is titled shadow absolutely love I'm
wearing this on my eyes and outer crease
today it's this warm warm purply deep
dark brown I absolutely love this color
it's gonna look beautiful on pretty much
everybody's skin tone and everybody's
eye color I've used it crazy the last
two months even if I'm doing a neutral
eye I'll use it just to blend out my
lower lash line I love this color
the balm over shadow sec spots and this
is in the shade work is overrated
I believe I did a tutorial using this it
is just a loose pigment and so pretty it
is so pigmented
I love how Cherie it is it looks like a
glitter is so shiny and beautiful on the
lid I love all of these by the balm all
of these loose shadows I think I have a
total of four of them or maybe five I
love them they're so pigmented and the
shimmer it's just the perfect amount it
looks like it's glitter but you don't
get crazy fallout like you do with
glitter so these are absolutely
beautiful
another pigment is taking me back to
makeup geek and I'm sure you guys know
what we're going to talk about this is
makeup geek afterglow I wore this thing
out this year I went through so much of
this oh my gosh but it is one of the
prettiest pigments in the world that's
why this is the other
in my video I only have two the one by
the fall and this one it is such a
beautiful shade it's right there so
glamorous so girly
perfect perfect shade not too much pink
not too much warmth or bronze it's just
gorgeous going it to just complement
everybody
beautiful beautiful pigment it's
actually I think this is my favorite
pigment I've ever used in my life
honestly it's beautiful this is an
eyeshadow by NARS called Mississippi
mermaid this came out with a limited
edition collection this year I don't
know exactly which one but it was recent
it's just again a basic beige shade it's
more of a gold tone wow i'm swatching
all over my body at this point it's
right here I'm sorry I'm so orange right
now this lighting is killing me anyways
absolutely loved Mississippi mermaid so
beautiful
I just love my neutral champagne shades
before this year I did experiment north
color but this year I really got into
the neutral shades I just think they're
gorgeous
and sticking with neutrals I do have two
more neutral shadows and this I
mentioned earlier quickly is the Stila
kitten eyeshadow you can't go wrong this
right here is the most beautiful
all-over shadow highlight under the brow
has on the cheeks everything it is so
creamy it's insane it's beautiful if you
don't own any beautiful perfect
highlights you can get this one and
it'll do it too and one for cheeks eyes
everything gorgeous it's won awards it's
like the prettiest highlighting shadow
of the world so kitten by Cielo a shade
I have honestly used this for like five
or six years now and this is probably
the fifteenth one that I own but it is
shroom by Mac I use it to highlight my
brow and every video that I do I use it
pretty much every single time I do my
makeup my favorite highlighter for any
shades of super super fair until you get
like a medium dark I just I absolutely
love shroom it's one of my favorite
highlights ever complements a huge
variety of skin tones I did discover the
Anastasia brow Wiz is these are in shade
soft brown and ash blonde I use two
eyebrow pencils when doing my brows I'll
link my
we're on video down below for you guys
if you want to see how up until this
year I use the Mac pencils so I fell in
love with these this year they're my
favorite brow pencil I've ever used in
my life and I don't see why I will be
changing it up ever
also the Anastacio clear brow gel to
hold your brows in place best brow gel
of life I used to use one from Mac the
fear brow gel I've also turned in from
the drugstore and a lot of people are
like its brow gel like who cares just
get the cheapest one no no no no no
there's a difference between bad brow
gel and go growl gel even though it's
clear and a mascara wand seems simple
but this is the best brow gel ever you
use this to comb through your brows and
your brows will not move anastasiya and
it has a super glue with this stuff it's
awesome two different launch companies I
discovered this year the first one is
the lower lashes they are 100% meek fur
and they are animal cruelty free
absolutely beautiful my favorite ones
are strike a pose this is not the lashes
what I'm talking about
strike a pose in a different box I don't
know where it is I will link them down
below and there actually is a discount
code for you guys now I'll put that down
below - but velour lashes I fell in love
with them this year
prettiest lashes once you get used to
using velour washes you never want to
use anything else because they're so
beautiful and fluffy and gorgeous and
natural-looking
it's yeah they're just glamorous they're
like red carpet lashes the other brand
is House of lashes and this is in the
style
siren these and then pixie loves pixie
luxe pixie I know what the other one is
called pixie something I'll list it down
below they are my two favorite styles I
love these I'm wearing House of lashes
today it's the pixie one and I can't
remember what it's called Dixie
something but I'll put it in the
description bar two eyeliners I don't
think this was introduced to me this
year but I have been using it ever since
January it's the Maybelline eye studio
gel liner yeah this actually I've been
using this for a couple years and it is
in the shade blackest black it's my
favorite gel liner it is black as coal I
absolutely love love this gel liner
super creamy really easy to work with
also make a geek immortal eyeliner
amazing gel liner this
stuff is the blackest eyeliner I'd ever
use in my entire life it is just
extremely hard to get off you have to
use a makeup remover and really take
your time because once this goes on it
does not move I'm telling you if you
have an issue with your your eyeliner
running this will not do it to you it
does not move be worn it doesn't move
it's no joke okay we're gonna move on to
lips I'm first going to talk about my
favorite lip moisturizer and basically
all of these have three of them coming
to my life in the past couple months and
then this one is been around for a while
this is the Josie Maran Argan lip
treatment it looks like a little bottle
of potion so cute I can't even take it
it smells like peaches and cream it's
wanted to dip your finger in it so
moisturizing on your lips you put it on
your lips feel moisturize for hours and
hours it does not fade away I'm really
picky about that needs to last a long
time so it is a great one also the
Maybelline Baby Lips dr. rescue this is
menthol and oh it's not like Vicks
VapoRub a little bit which I love that
scent if you don't you won't like this
but it's very very moisturizing and it's
definitely medicated that which is why
it's referred to dr. rescue but it's
great for super chapped dry hydrated
dehydrated lips this is by philosophy
and it's called pink almond candy I've
used this intensely it is so amazing it
is so moisturizing it smells like
straight almond cream it is so luxurious
I love this lip balm super moisturizing
and then this is the newest one this is
soap &amp;amp; Glory a great kisser this is a
lip moisturizer and it literally smells
and tastes like peppermint candy cane oh
it's amazing this one is more like a
gloss but it is so moisturizing so
smooth it's like butter but it's kind of
lossy but it's still super moisturizing
I have a lot of lip products I'm going
to try to breathe through these quickly
I discovered the urban decay lipstick
this year absolutely loving this is in
native and naked too the formula is
absolutely beautiful they are
so creamy I feel like that's my word of
the video with that's why these are all
my favorite products because they're
creamy and I love creamy products so
pigmented so smooth they go on with such
a breeze and native is such a gorgeous
perfect pink nude color and it feels
like a little moisturizer on the lips
and I love the packaging really durable
Marc Jacob lip glosses these are more
expensive of course I love the smell of
them this is studded kiss I fell in love
with this color this year I talked about
it in the favorite video I believe it is
so pretty it's such a nice violet but it
doesn't come off to violet it's like a
nice little berry shade it's got little
tiny flecks of shimmer in it which I
usually don't like but in this one you
really can't even see them it's very
very beautiful it's like a nice
raspberry juicy color dose of color lip
glosses
I love these they are a lip gloss for
but they go on a more like a mousse not
an actual gloss but they are crazy crazy
crazy pigmented as you can see right
there they're very intense and
pigmentation but I love you this is an
attitude and sunshine kisses I have been
using these a lot recently and I'm
really enjoying that this is Revlon
Bellini and this is I don't know what
this is still available yes it is I saw
there's a couple days ago again
beautiful nude similar Turkish delight
by NARS but it's drugstore great great
gloss it goes on high-end it's just it's
beautiful color this I use all summer
long
this is buxom extortion and this is a
lip tarnish it goes like this it has a
thing to sharpen it right there it's a a
crayon it is such a pretty shade it's
like the perfect amount of pink I did it
about everything I loved it in the
summer time I wore all the time I would
just do like tinted moisturizer mascara
and this on those like chill summer days
and I actually loved it such a beautiful
color nyx butter glosses these made
their way in my collection this year i
own a bunch of them i actually love them
again super inexpensive
can find this brand Ulta they're so
buttery so smooth great with pigment
amazing color payoff and awesome color
range so NYX butter glosses
I discovered my favorite lipstick
formula from the drugstore this year and
it is the Maybelline line this right
here is shocking coral it was a part of
their vivid collection and it's not this
specific color that I love the most
it's just this line in general I love
Maybelline lipsticks they are actually
beautiful so I have bought tons of
Maybelline lipstick ever since this
collection came out and spring
absolutely love love Maybelline YSL
lipsticks this year is the first time I
bought a YSL lipstick for myself I
absolutely love them this is in the
shade number two and I just love the
color it's a perfect perfect nude they
go on like silk
they really just the the feeling of
these is unlike any other lipsticks that
I've ever tried go try it for yourself
when you put it on and does not feel
like any other lipstick that I can
describe it just feels like silk on your
lips so luxurious and the packaging
sells itself it's absolutely beautiful
these are the buxom lip glosses the
full-on lip creams this is in the shade
lavender Cosmo I also have it in white
Russian and I think Samantha absolutely
love these they do have a super minty
cooling effect them on the lips
absolutely adore them though they're
supposed to be like lip plumping I don't
see the lip plumping factor working in
them but I just like the color payoff
I like how they look and I like how they
feel so I actually love these bucks and
lip glosses and the packaging you get
tons of product and I think it's super
cute
line prime lipsticks were new to my
collection this year this is the shade
coquettes Cosmo pop and BAE bet these
are my three favorite colors so this is
Coke X this is Cosmo pop and this is a
BAE bet right there absolutely love
these they're very similar to MAC
lipsticks they smell just like MAC
lipsticks I'm assuming they have vitamin
E in them love the packaging who doesn't
like blend prime packaging it's adorable
so yes go line crime NARS Chelsea girls
I saw Kim Kardashian wearing this lip
color
oh gosh in the very beginning of the
year and I was like obsessed with
finding out what lip color was because
it was so beautiful and I ended up
finding out that it was not as Chelsea
girls so it's in this pot like this we
could kind of dig in and grab it with
your finger it is the perfect nude shade
for pretty much any skin tone it's
perfect it's not too pale it's not too
Brown perfect lip color three glosses by
Sigma Beauty this also came out on the
enlight collection when I first saw them
I thought oh those are way too dark for
me I do I'm not gonna like those because
they look like they're super dark when
they go on they are tense so they are
not super dark and pigmented so when it
swipes on oh my gosh they're so pretty
so they're much more cheered out when
you apply them and they're actually
gorgeous I've been wearing is it crazy I
love the applicator they go on so smooth
so you can see they're not super super
intense like they look in the two it
looks like it's gonna take a dark purple
but it's not on the skin they're
gorgeous
I'm super fair right now and I can wear
all three of these shades and I love
them I did wear these two mixed together
in like two videos ago and some people
were asking me what lipstick I was
wearing and it was these I did put in my
description bar but I love love these
these right here are the Revlon
Colorstay this is the matte balm this is
the lacquer balm
anyways I'm talking about these because
the Revlon Colorstay lip line in general
I discovered this year and I love them
the lacquers and mats whatever is
they're so pigmented so beautiful so
creamy they last a long time they have
so many different colors I just I love
them so revlon colorburst
they're amazing I own probably I would
say five to ten of these shades maybe a
little bit more I'm not totally positive
but love them another
drug store lick brand that really feels
like it's more high-end in last
shoutouts this brand is the Kardashian
chroma lip crams I've mentioned even in
my videos before I love them they're so
pigmented super easy to apply
beautiful colors again these are the
drugstore so they're inexpensive I've
use them so much I have a baby doll sea
coral and then this all-natural one all
beautiful shades love them year-round
appropriate so yes Kardashian chroma
crayons and you don't hear many people
talk about them on YouTube so you guys
honestly we love you sorry I can get
these they're absolutely gorgeous
gorgeous so easy to apply I will quickly
mention just a couple of brushes that
really stood out to use here my Sigma
f80 kabuki brush I have been using this
since 2009 this is my first brush ever
purchased by them you watch my videos
you know I use it all the time there's
no other way I apply my foundation
without this brush love it the Sigma
tapered highlighter and f-35 I use this
to set my under eye concealer with
powder or to highlight my cheekbones or
Cupid's bow or anything else love this
brush there's really not many brushes
like this on the market
so Sigma did a great job one more Sigma
brush is the tapered kabuki f-86 this
year I discovered this for concealer and
I love it it's the only way I blend out
my concealer now it with the f-86 it
blends out so beautifully and because it
is a synthetic fibers and it is a kabuki
brush it just really helps you out and
works to your advantage or applying
makeup and then of course my NARS
contour brush this is the Ida brush eita
brushes the ITO brush you guys told me
last time i mispronounced it is the ITO
brush so absolutely full on this brush I
know a lot of you guys have been saying
it's impossible to get your hands on it
sold out everywhere it is like the most
miracle contour brush of life I use it
every single time I contour now I don't
think I'll ever stop using this brush to
contour unless someone
designed something better so that is it
for my beauty favorites of 2013 I'm
sorry if I was talking million miles an
hour during this video it was
overwhelming having so many products in
front of my face and trying to get
through it anyways I hope that you guys
enjoyed and let me know if you do want
