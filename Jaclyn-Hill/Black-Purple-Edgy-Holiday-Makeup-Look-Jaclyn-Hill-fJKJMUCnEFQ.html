holiday look for you this totally does
not need to be specifically worn for the
holidays this is totally an appropriate
look to wear all year round I'm calling
our holiday look because it's that time
of year and we incorporate some glitter
so therefore I can qualify it as a
holiday look
I would definitely gear this towards a
new your new yours a new yours Eve New
Year's Eve look definitely so I feel
like I've done tons of neutral looks
here on my channel recently saw was like
okay Jaclyn the world is ready it is
time to do something over-the-top
smoky dark glamorous glittery
colorful so that's exactly what I am
doing this is a very monochromatic look
because we are working with purple tones
on the eyes cheeks and lips which I
absolutely love and I have to be honest
this I look this whole I look this color
combination is literally just speaks to
me like it is everything I just
absolutely love it I hope that you guys
enjoy this look as much as I do because
I like I will continue to wear this
periodically for the next year of my
life because I just love it this is
going to be like a go-to purple smokey
eye for me and my favorite part about
this look is for those of you who fear
looking like a panda when doing a smoky
eye I totally get it legit fear because
of the technique that we are going to
use in this video we are going to have a
really just kind of harsh line right
here on the edge which will really make
sure that you don't have like that
circular around panda look for those of
you who are scared to look like an
animal like I get it so I hope that you
guys enjoy this video I love you
creating this look for you but I am now
way too glam for 4 o'clock on a
Wednesday to literally sit on my couch
and edit this video so you know
hopefully you guys create this look for
yourself and put it to better use then
I'm about to so I know
enjoy thank you so much for watching I
love you guys and I'll see you soon bye
so once our eyes are primed of course we
are going to go in with some good old
scotch tape I have shown this technique
before in the past and I just absolutely
love it
so what you're going to do is take a
piece of scotch tape put it on the back
of your hand
rip it on rip it off a couple of times
that way it's not super sticky and it
won't pull too harshly at your skin when
you're removing it you want to line it
up with your bottom lash line going
towards the tail of your brow you can
really make this at an extreme angle or
more of a soft angle however you feel
just as long as you try your best to
make them as even as possible
that way when you remove this
good-looking tape it's not going to look
wonky and if it does a Quang key that's
okay we have tips to fix that so the
first thing to do is go in with makeup
geek wisteria eyeshadow this is a really
really pretty kind of pastel e purple
and it's going to work great for our
transition color so I am using an e 40
brush from Sigma one of my favorite
blending brushes of all time to put this
in my upper crease area since we are
working with purples in that crease this
is going to make it so that we don't
have any harsh lines because when you're
working with a deep purple you're
usually need a lighter purple to kind of
buff everything out and blend it so that
it doesn't just abruptly stop then I'm
going to go in with a makeup forever eye
shadow which I love this has to be my
favorite purple ever and this is in the
shade M 9 to 8
don't worry I'll link it down below I am
using a makeup geek stiff dome brush to
blend this out as you can see I'm really
focusing a lot of this color on that
outer corner of the eye cuz I really
want that outer corner to pop with a lot
of depth and dimension so I am going to
keep this kind of lower in the crease
area we put that first color wisteria up
in the upper crease and as you can see
now you really don't even notice it
that's what's so wonderful about
transition colors is you really don't
see them in the end look but it makes it
so that you have no harsh lines so I'm
going to go back with that same with
Syria as before and that same makeup
geek blending brush and I'm going to go
over again just to make sure that
everything is completely buffed out as
you see I did go all the way to the
inner corner if you don't go all the way
to the inner corner it just won't look
as dramatic but I really wanted to go
all out so I took it all the way into
that inner tear-duct and I'm really
making sure that outer corner is nice
and blended
then I'm going to go in with makeup geek
corrupt which as you can see I've
pan and this is my second one it is the
blackest black you will ever use it is
intense
so taking any pencil brush I'm just
going to put this on the outer corner of
my eye what I love about putting the
tape down on my eyelid area is you can
really be as messy as you want and you
don't have to worry about it because
when you rip that tape off rip when you
gently take that tape off from your eye
area you're not going to have any of
that messiness it's just going to be a
nice crisp line so I am kind of slightly
doing a very soft cut crease in a sense
because I am making sure that I'm not
going to cover up that purple I want it
to stay underneath of that purple and
kind of in the lower crease of my eye
and then all over that outer corner and
a v-shaped motion then I will go back in
with that same makeup geek brush and
just blend it out so that it blends
nicely in with that purple then going in
with an m3 2-1 brush from morphe I'm
going to take a little bit more of that
original purple from Make Up For Ever
and just make sure that it still stays
nice and vibrant and intense because I
don't want it to look black I want to
look black and purple then I'm going to
go in with Too Faced shadow insurance
glitter glue I'm going to put this on
the back of my hand and I'm going to
work one eye at a time so I'm going to
just take any finger and just apply it
with my finger I just think it's the
easiest like who needs brushes when you
can use your finger and this is one of
those times a finger will do just fine
now we are going to go in with the star
of the show and this is Mac pressed
pigment in the shade black grape oh my
gosh can we talk about it like look at
this color oh I love it so much so I am
going to be working one eye at a time so
after I'm done with my right eye I will
then take that glitter glue pack it on
the inner corner of my left eye and then
immediately grab that pigment and start
pressing it on I always apply these
pigments with my finger because I don't
think any brush applies these like my
finger does so I kind of Pat and rub at
the same time and with this glitter glue
you are not going to have this falling
on your face or your lashes it is
amazing
now for the satisfying part ah taking
off the tape to reveal our nice crisp
clean edges now on my left eye it was a
little jagged E which is totally okay
because I will just go in with that same
corrupt black eyeshadow from makeup geek
and just any liner or brow brush and I
will just fix that by two
putting a little bit of black shadow
there so now I'm just putting a thin
coat of mascara on my lashes just to
prep for false lashes I am going to be
going in with lashes by Lena in the
style Bianca oh my gosh
these are my favorite lashes right now
they are just incredible and what I love
about love about dramatic looks like
we're doing right now is you don't need
to do eyeliner which is great not to
have to deal with like the HUS and the
fuss of eyeliner you just pop on lashes
and you are good to go
look at how gorgeous these lashes are oh
my gosh okay I'm gonna be going in with
NARS Pro Prime instant line filler and
pore corrector I think something like
that basically I'm going to put this in
the areas of my face where my foundation
tends to crease because as you guys know
I make very animated facial expressions
and so my foundation does crease in the
lines of my forehead and my smile lines
because I'm wrinkling up my face all the
time what can I say so I'm going to rub
that into my skin and then I will go in
with my foundation today I'm going to be
using the g6 brush from morphe to apply
my foundation as always and then I'm
going to be using the YSL pushy claw
foundation I'm currently using the shade
B 40 in case you guys are curious I'm
super fair right now but it's fine we'll
make it work this foundation does
oxidize just so you know it will get
darker efforts on your face for about an
hour or so so if you're interested in
this foundation I would tend to go a
little bit lighter rather than darker
because it will get darker throughout
the day then I'm going to go in with
concealer same drill as always you know
what's happening I'm using Mac Pro
Longwear concealer in the shade nw20 I'm
going to put it from the inner tear-duct
down top towards the side of the nose
and then up towards the temple and then
using a damp Beauty blender to blend all
of that out then I'm going to do is go
in with a I don't know what brush this
is this is from morphe though it's an
eyeshadow blending brush I'm going to
take a tiny bit of concealer on this
brush and clean up that inner corner of
my eye just because sometimes when
you're working with dark colors it can
kind of just splatter everywhere and
just become too intense on that inner
corner this is just a nice soft way to
kind of blend that inner corner with a
little bit of concealer and make it look
a little bit cleaner then I'm going to
set my under eye concealer with some
powder nothing new nothing exciting it's
a must for me or I'm going to crease
like a B then I'm going to go in with
Mac mylar eye shadow and I'm going to
use this as my
I like today I didn't want to do like an
intense frosty highlight or inner corner
highlight because I definitely think the
eyes speak for themselves
then I'm going to just fill in my
eyebrows and we're going to speed along
very quickly because I just did an
updated brow routine for you guys so I
will link that down below blah boom
moving on I'm going to be taking an
angled brush and a black eyeshadow and
putting it just on the outer corner of
my lower lash line because I'm going to
show you guys the difference in two
different options that you can do for
this look I'm then going to take that
same m32 one brush by morphe and take
that purple color from Make Up For Ever
all the way to the inner corner so now
you can see one eye with just that black
on the outer corner and then you can see
this eye which is much more dramatic and
I'm going to make it even more dramatic
so you can really change this look
however makes you feel comfortable you
can make it much more subtle on the
lower lash line or you can go all out
like I'm going to do whenever I do a
tutorial I'd like to do all or nothing
and show you guys every single step but
you can totally tone this down for your
face if you feel more appropriate that
way I'm going to blend this lower lash
line out with wisteria from makeup geek
I'm just going to be repeating the exact
same shadows I use on the upper lid but
I am NOT going to bring any of that
glitter on the lower lash line because I
feel like that sometimes can get too
overwhelming so I'm going to take that
same corrupt black eyeshadow from makeup
geek and I'm going to press that very
tightly all along that lower lash line
and I am going to bring it all the way
in to the inner tear-duct of my eye to
really make my eyes pop once I have done
that I'm going to move on to mascara I
am using the mac gigablack but gigablack
lash mascara it's just a great lower
lash mascara and I'm going to put a thin
coat of that on my lower lashes then
once I've done that I'm going to go in
with my favorite black eyeliner at the
moment this is my ardency in it is so
creamy so black and like you just put on
a tiny bit and you are good to go so I
am going to coat my lower waterline with
that you can see my right eye has it and
my left eye doesn't so you can see the
difference that it makes it really just
draws more attention to the eye if you
have small eyes and you don't make them
look smaller I would avoid this step
because it can kind of make the eyes
look a little bit smaller but it will
also bring more attention to them and
make them pop more as well now I'm going
to be taking a makeup forever bronzer
and number
wanted to be contouring and I am using a
makeup geek it's technically a blush
brush but I'm going to be using it to
contour so just going from the top of
the ear down towards the corner of my
mouth I'm going to draw a pretty
distinct line and I'm going to blend
that upward remember never to blend
downward or you will defeat the purpose
of carving out that cheekbone and I'm
going to select that on the upper part
of my forehead especially on the outer
part of my forehead down by my temples
and then going in with a morphe I
believe this is like an mb5 brush I'm
going to blend that all out then I will
go back with a little bit more
foundation on my foundation brush and
I'm going to sculpt out that lower part
of my face to really make that contour
pop this is a trick if you get a little
bit too sloppy and your bronzer or your
contour color kind of falls down this
will sharpen everything up and give you
a little bit more of a striking contour
which I wanted for this look in
particular so once we have done that I'm
going to move on to blush and I'm going
to be using this gorgeous blush by Mac
this is called koi girl I used to love
this color so much oh my gosh I am using
a g8 brush by morphe which is my
favorite blush brush right now I feel
like everything I'm like this is my
favorite at the moment but it really is
my favorite right now so putting that on
the apples of my cheeks and moving
upward towards the temples then I'm
going to go in and highlight I am using
hourglass ambient lighting powder in the
shade luminous light I was kind of
unsure about that one I am going to be
using an NV 13 morphe eyeshadow blending
brush to apply this to the top of my
cheekbones this is a very subtle
beautiful highlighter I've said before
it is ideal for brides because it just
looks like you're glowing from within
and it is absolutely gorgeous and then
for my lips I'm going to be going in
with my favorite lip liner at the moment
this is NARS lip liner in the shade el
agua I am going to line my lips and then
completely fill them in and you can see
it's just this gorgeous purpley mouth
color I love it then going in with buxom
true nude lip foundation in the shade
buff I'm only going to be pressing this
on the center of my upper and lower lip
and this will really make your lips look
more plump and I also just kind of
wanted to lighten this color a little
bit and give it some dimension as well
then I'm going to go in with a
Maybelline elixir and the shade mob
mystique which is this gorgeous plum
it's so beautiful and I wanted a glossy
lip with this look today then to finish
everything off I'm going to go in with
Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray
and just drench myself take a quick
shower in this to make it very official
and then of course I have to praise the
heavens because we are done so I hope
that you guys enjoy this makeup look
thank you so much for watching I love
you and I'll see you soon
play because it has glitter oh I'll talk
it out twerk it out you know you know
what I'm saying
totally walk ball really go together
beachy with a brush ah oh my god

incorporated can qualify as a holiday
