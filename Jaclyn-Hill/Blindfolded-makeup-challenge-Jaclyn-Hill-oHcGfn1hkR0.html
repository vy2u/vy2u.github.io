products here on the floor in front of
me as she gets to pick then while she's
blindfolded and do my makeup and see
what what happens last one by for me she
thinks she's gonna do better than I did
I I did a beautiful job beautiful

file so that you really can't see why I
told you okay you know and I do not have
any products as she did she had like two
foundations two powders two mascaras two
of everything like sunshine pretty hard
on her I'm a easy because I came to her
house so I brought all my stuff and just
like a small thing so I have like one of
everything so it's gonna be easier for
her let me throw my hair up you can
start you can start feeling around there
girls yeah this is sorry this is this is
mine this is gel liner oh okay good let
me this is function ah why is brush so
small is it small or is it regular size
