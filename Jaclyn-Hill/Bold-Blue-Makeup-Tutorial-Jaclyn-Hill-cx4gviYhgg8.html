a makeup tutorial on this look right
here I told you guys I would be doing
something different and colorful and
smokey and this is exactly what I was
referring to so I just want to say thank
you so much to those of you who
requested a blue smokey eye it is
because of you that I created this for
you guys and I have to say big thank you
because I absolutely loved it and I
would have never have done this or
thought of it if it wasn't for your
requests so thank you so much for that
this look is structured it is intense it
is dramatic is over the top I absolutely
love it this look is for my Queens
you're more like a day-to-day neutral
girl I got tons of other tutorials for
that and I'll be back with more neutral
looks later but today we are feeling
ourselves that's better
lost my snap there for a second I know
the Blues can be intimidating but just
don't forget to blend and take your time
and all the work out I promise practice
makes perfect and like my mom always
said late at night before you wash your
face just pull out your makeup brushes
pull out your palette and just do your
makeup for five minutes and if you're
trying to learn a new technique like
this lower lash technique or a winged
liner just try for five minutes every
night it's just makeup it wipes off so
you can just try it wipe it off try it
wipe it off wash your face go to bed
sleep on it try the next night you know
what I'm saying if you do that for a few
nights in a row I promise you you can
learn any technique that you want
nothing is intimidating nothing is too
hard to achieve a makeup you got this
and remember it's just makeup you know
I'm saying wipes right off and you can
forget it ever happened
enjoy the video I love you guys and I'll
see you soon bye hello my love's my eyes
are already primed and I'm going to be
going in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie
eye shadow I know I use this in the
beginning of every single makeup look
but it's so similar my skin tone
going back and forth with this in my
entire crease area just makes it so that
no matter what colors I choose to go in
with it's going to blend easily now I'm
going to go in with makeup geek
unexpected this is the perfect
transition color if you're working with
blues or purples because the cool tone
greyish purple it's just perfect and
it's matte so using that same Sigma e-40
I'm going to dust that back and forth
all the way from the inner corner to the
outer corner in the upper crease area
now I'm going to go in with the star of
the show and this is Aniston
Ziya star cobalt this is a very intense
metallic eyeshadow so when I apply this
I pull my eyelid taught like you can see
me pulling it there to really get all
that pigment all over the entire lid and
it gives a very shimmery look I'm going
to make sure that I put this on the
entire lower lid area but I do not want
to go any further than my crease I want
to keep this nice and low because the
issue with colors like this is if you
take it too high all of a sudden that's
when it becomes a mess so keep it low
keep it on your lid and do not surpass
your crease area now I'm going to go in
with a sigma e25 brush and a little bit
more of that unexpected eyeshadow and we
are just going to begin to blend blend
blend back and forth and windshield
wiper motions away from the outer corner
to the inner corner until you see that
that blue shade is no longer a harsh
jagged line in the crease then I'm going
to go in with Mac blackberry eyeshadow
this is just a few shades darker than
unexpected which is why I'm going in
with it because you want to start off
with a lighter shade and then blend that
and then go darker and then blend that
you never want to just go in with a dark
shade and expect that to blend out
beautifully so you blend it between
every single step and that is how you
achieve a flawless blended smooth smoky
eye too does not have any harsh jagged
lines so once we have moved on from that
step I'm going to take a makeup remover
wipe and clean up the under eye and then
I will also use this to create kind of a
cat eye with that shadow it's a nice
easy trick to kind of get that shape
that you want that very sculpted eye
look and then I will go in with
Maybelline gel liner and the shade
blackest black and then just create a
typical black winged liner the great
thing about using that makeup wipe to
remove the excess and creating that
harsh line is you can then follow it
with your eyeliner so it makes it simple
to do a wing now I'm going to go in with
makeup geek poolside eyeshadow
absolutely gorgeous I should have done
this before my eyeliner but I didn't
think about it and once my eyeliner was
done I was looking at my eyes and I was
like we need something else so taking
the same brush this is the Mac 242 that
I use to apply the star cobalt I'm going
to just tap this on the center of the
lid and then blend out and as you can
see it just gives the eye much more
dimension and it just kind of brings
that upper lid together then I'm just
going to go over and fix my eyeliner and
just kind of go over that and make it
blacker because we completely messed it
up because I should have done that step
first so if you are trying to yourself
at home
do that part first then do your liner
now I'm going to be applying lashes i am
using house of lashes iconic these are
my absolute favorite lashes at the
moment I can't get enough of them I wear
them every day I wear them with no liner
liner a smokey eye and neutral eye I
swear they are just so gorgeous I'm in
love with them right now we're going to
go in and prime my skin and I am using
Makeup Forever radiance primer using
clean hands of course we're just going
to use this all over our entire face and
then I'm going to be using a newer
foundation today and this is by the
brand LC cosmetics oh my gosh you guys I
talked about this on snapchat so I'm
just so in love with it right now and
I'm also going to be wetting my face
with some mac fix+
the reason I'm doing this is because
this LC foundation is definitely made
for those of you who are more oily to
normal
maybe combination skin since I am dry I
don't want it to be so mad so I use a
radiance primer and then I use a dewy
skin mist or a mac fix+
just to give a little bit more of a glow
to the skin because it will dry
extremely mad on me i am using the
morphe foundation brush this is the M
439 my favorite foundation brush right
now it just smooths everything out so
beautifully and because of the size and
the density it just makes it so that you
don't have a build up a foundation on
the skin and you don't go overboard now
I'm going to do the under eye concealer
of course I wanted a bright highlight
today so I'm going to start off with
using the Urban Decay weightless Naked
concealer I think it's called something
like that you know what I'm talking
about I'm going to use this in a
triangle motion I'm going to take it
down the sides of my nose and I'm going
to drag it back towards the temple using
a very damp Beauty Blender I'm going to
blend that outward I'm bringing that
down on the cheek area and then I'm
going to take it all the way up to kind
of emphasize the center of the cheeks
and then up towards the temple to give
that lift I'm also going to even out
that highlight by putting it on the chin
the upper lip the nose and the center of
the forehead and then again go back with
the damp Beauty Blender and blend that
out using a damp Beauty Blender will
make sure that you have tons of excess
product it'll pick it up and you don't
have cake face that's why I love the
Beauty Blender because like right there
I put a little too much product on my
upper lip but that's okay when you're
working with a Beauty Blender because
it'll pick up the excess and you're not
going to have cake frostings to be on
your upper lip because that's not cute
on anybody I'm going to set my under eye
concealer and I'm using a Mac emphasize
which is a pro product and I'm going to
mix it with the Anastasio
banana concealer and I'm going to really
highlight that under area again on the
sides of the nose the cheeks up towards
the temple and then I will also set it
on the chin the Cupid's bow the nose and
a little on the forehead as well because
we want to even out that highlight
you're going to highlight you got a
highlight do it all girl don't miss any
spots now I'm going to go in and take
care of dem brows I am using Anastasia
brow Wiz in the shade taupe I believe
and then once I have filled in my brows
I as always use a little bit of
concealer underneath that brow just to
help carve it out and give it a little
bit more dimension especially on the
arch of the brow now I'm going to go in
with Mac shroom eyeshadow I'm going to
use this to highlight the upper brow
bone I absolutely love highlighting the
brow bone especially when you're doing a
smoky eye it just gives that glamazon
very bombshell look to the eyes and I
just think that it is beautiful so I
always make sure to highlight then I'm
going to also highlight generously on
the inner corner of the eye because the
technique we're going to use on the
bottom lash line is really going to pop
with this highlight on the inner corner
so I'm packing on that highlight and
then I'm going to go in with the
Anastacio cream color and the shade ice
blue she came out with I think five or
six of these cream colors and they are
so pigmented they are amazing I was
nervous that putting on my waterline was
gonna irritate my eyes but it didn't it
didn't burn it didn't sting it didn't
irritate them which is surprising
because my eyes get so irritated so
easily in this color like can we talk
about it it is so beautiful now I'm
going to go in with Mac navel this is a
pro color so you can get on mac
cosmetics calm or at prostores it is a
very dark navy blue kind of purple shade
it is more on the cool side which is
different for me but that's why I chose
it it's gorgeous and I love that it's a
matte color so I am just using an angled
brush as you can see I believe this is
actually a Nastasia brow brush
technically but whatever moving on I'm
going to line this very tightly on the
lower lash line and then once I get to
that inner corner as you can see instead
of sticking to my lash line I'm just
going to kind of go down and create
almost the effect of a cat eye I do have
a tutorial going in-depth on this a
little bit more I will link it down
below it was my trendy eye tutorial I
believe it's called as you can see here
my right eye just was not as perfect as
the left so I went in with a little bit
of concealer
definer brush and I just kind of clean
it up we all make mistakes but it's okay
it's just makeup you can clean up your
mistakes and move on no one ever knows
I'm going to just blend out that lower
lashline using any pencil brush I don't
really have any additional products on
this I just kind of went in and blended
it out because I didn't want the bottom
lash line to be too overly smoky I
wanted it to be nice and defined
but I didn't want it to be too intense
just like a jagged line I never like
jagged lines let's get real I'm all
about that blending life I'm going to
cut my lower lashes with mascara and now
I'm going to go in and contour today I'm
going to be using if you make up forever
bronzer and number 30 and we are gonna
kick it old-school baby with the NARS
eita brush oh I forgot how much I miss
this brush you guys I love it so much if
you want to structure contour I still
stand behind this brush it is so amazing
as you can see right here the proof is
in the pudding it's just so easy to
contour with it just makes such a
beautiful line but because the bristles
are nice and kind of fluff out it's not
too intense and too harsh to the point
that you're like oh dear God it's just
an amazing brush I absolutely love it
now I'm going to go in with blush and I
am using Becca blush and the shade Sweet
Pea and I'm going to be using the morphe
e for blush brush which by the way this
is the first blush brush ever that has
made me turn my back on the Mac 129 it
is amazing I'll talk about it more in
depth later but I just absolutely love
it now I'm going to carve out my contour
i'm using a morphe five-10 brush and any
light powder that you have as long as
it's matte will do for this put it right
underneath that contour and then just
wipe it away and that will help just
kind of strengthen your contour and make
it look more structured so that it's not
messy then just taking a little bit of
bronzer I'm going to put that right
underneath the lower lip and it will
help it look a little bit fuller and a
little bit more pouty oh well the tricks
I decided to go back in with a little
bit of black eyeshadow because I just
felt like that inner corner wasn't
popping enough for me so just taking a
little bit of makeup geek corrupt I'm
going to put that on that inner corner
just for a little bit more of a pop then
I'm going to highlight the cheeks and
I'm going to be using the hourglass
ambient lighting powder in the shade a
luminous light and I'm using the morphe
m50 one brush for this this is like my
favorite highlighting brush of all time
and I'm going to place this all over the
cheeks and the cheekbones for a little
bit of a glow then I'm going to set my
eyebrows with a Nastasia clear brow gel
which is the best brow gel in the entire
world I swear to god it's superglue in a
tube for your brows
now I'm going to pair this look with a
nude lip I was going back and forth and
I didn't want to do a pink or a peach
because these eyes just make such a
statement so I decided to go with a
Nastasia liquid lipstick in the shade
which was a beautiful nude and what I
love about it is it stays all day
because it's a liquid lipstick and it
doesn't require a lip liner so last but
not least we are just going to now set
our face I'm using Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray just to lock all
this in and we are done I hope you enjoy
