this very dark smoky eye tutorial for
you this is like a modified version of
that classic bombshell look with the
super highlighted cheeks and the intense
contour the smokey eye of the new lips
you know you you used to see this
everywhere you know all the Playboy
Bunnies would wear this and Pamela
Anderson made this famous but you know
just more of an up-to-date version and I
use colors from the lorac Pro palette
I've gotten a lot of you guys asking me
how I feel about this palette I really
do love it I don't reach for it as often
as I wish I would that's amazing oh my
god my eyeshadow just broke lovely I
really love the colors that I use I
think they're beautiful on all different
eye colors they're absolutely gorgeous
it's something that you wouldn't expect
it's not just a black smokey eye the
technique that I'm using is extremely
easy it looks like it's complex when
you're looking at me right now but you
will be surprised by how easy it is and
you can do this technique with any
colors that your heart desires so I hope
you enjoyed this look and I will see you
guys in my next video bye
first thing I am going to do is put this
brown now grease paint stick this is a
very old product from Mac you can get a
Maybelline Color state-a - there's one
literally in this exact same color but
I've already primed my eyes then over
top of that I'm just going to put this
at the base of my lid and rub it around
with any brush I'm using a precision
brush by Sigma and then I use my fingers
as well this does not need to be precise
just get the darkness on the bottom of
your lid and then I'm going to go in
with creme Brule by makeup geek again I
am obsessed with this eyeshadow and I'm
just going to rub it around with a sigma
e25 I believe it's just like the Mac 217
and I'm just going to put this in the
crease now just a warning when you start
looks like this it always looks really
weird and messed up for the first half
and then all of a sudden comes together
I'm going to use the lorac Pro palette
I'm going to use this garnett shade and
this is a lot like Mac's antiqued
it's this really beautiful rusty it's a
brown brown with a red tint and it is
gorgeous it is so similar to Mac's
antique I held them next to each other
and they're the exact same color and I'm
just going to put this on a 242 brush by
Mac and push this all over the lid up
into my crease a little bit further into
my crease than I normally do as you can
see I'm literally putting it in there
sideways and just dusting it back and
forth then I'm going to take another
makeup geek eyeshadow and Coco bear love
this it's similar to Mac's Brown script
but I think I like it even better
her eyeshadows have so much pigment and
they are so easy to blend it's amazing
so anyways I'm going to start on the
outer corner of my eye really working
this into the crease but I'm going to
bring it into the inner corner as well
because this isn't a cat eye look this
is a very blown out smokey eye so you
want that color to go just as much
upward as you do outward you're going to
want to bring it all the way into the
inner corner of the eye as well when you
don't have tons of product on your brush
then i'm going to take Mac's copper ring
this is totally optional this look does
not need this color but I get so many
comments from my subscribers tell me all
the time that you guys own copper ring
so I thought I'd throw it in there I
just put on the ball of my eye just for
an extra pop of dimension now I'm going
to take max smolder eye Kohl L'Oreal has
a great
I called the drugstore it's like the
exact same thing and just rub this on
the base the lash line as sloppy as you
want take any black I'm going to use the
one from the lorac palette this is kind
of a grey though it's not really that
black next to other blacks but it
doesn't matter just take it on any
smudgy brush and just smoke it out so
you just want to rub it back and forth
and take it upward and then the outer
corner kind of flick it so that you get
some depth and dimension in that outer
corner as well again none of this is
precise that's why it's such a fun easy
look it's just so smokey then I'm going
to take nude for some reason on camera
it's not showing up that much but it has
good pigmentation and I'm just going to
use that to highlight underneath of my
brows just for that typical highlight
that I have to have in every video and
I'm going to take makeup for ever HD
foundation I am in shade one two three
in case you are curious on my Holy Grail
Sigma flat top kabuki brush this is the
f80
and I know it doesn't match my skin but
that's okay because it matches my neck
and my body I promise you I use a
Clarisonic on my skin every night so my
face is never the same color as my body
because I'm constantly exfoliating I'm
filling in my brows with the Anastasia
brow Wiz this is in what's the color
soft brown and I'm giving my brow a lot
of definition because of the smokey eyes
that we're doing in this bombshell look
that we're going with I want to give
them a lot of Arc okay and then I'm
going to use Mac Pro Longwear concealer
in nw20 I have been using 25 but I'm
using 20 for this look because this look
really calls for a really highlighted
face so I'm using 20 of my Beauty
Blender oops sorry about my phone and
then I am just going to rub that out
with my finger in the inner corner and
as always I'm taking emphasize Pro
highlighting powder by Mac you can get
this online you don't have to have a pro
card or anything and I'm going to just
dab this all under my eye area I'm not
using tons of it just a tiny bit and
this will just kind of make everything
blend easier when we go in with blush
and everything else and now that I have
that set I'm going to do my under eye
color I'm using cocoa bear once again
the same color by makeup geek that I use
in my crease and I'm using a two unto
brush by Mac and I'm going to push this
deep into the lash line
make sure you bring it up in that outer
corner and connect it to the eyeshadow
that is on top of the eye and then any
pencil brush I think this is a Sedona
lace one they all do the same thing and
I'm just going to smoke that out you can
go in with more Coco bear or you can
grab some creme Brule whatever you want
just make sure that you smoke it out
take your time with this a lot of people
are afraid to smoke out their bottom
lashline really harshly but don't be
because this will really complete the
look make sure you connect it to that
outer corner like you see me doing right
now then I'm going to take Mac shroom
this is my favorite highlighter in the
entire world for the eyes and I'm not
going to put it actually in my inner
corner like on top of the shadow I'm
going to do it around it just to open up
that area just to give it more highlight
bring more attention and then just use
any mascara and put a coat of mascara on
the lashes this is by L'Oreal and then
throw on any lashes that you want you
will see the difference in these eyes
with lashes it really completes this
look and I do not know what lashes these
are it kills me they were not in the
right packaging they're beautiful and I
have no idea what they are I'm going to
go on a hunt okay now I'm going to use
Bobbi Brown golden light bronzer I
cannot say enough good things about this
bronzer right now seriously this is my
favorite bronzer I think I've ever used
it is so beautiful it blends out
immaculately is just it looks like it's
airbrushed I'm using the same NARS brush
that I use in my last video I hear you
guys asking me for all kinds of
tutorials on it so I will be doing that
soon and I'm just going to buff this out
I'm giving myself a pretty harsh contour
and then I'm just going to put it along
the hairline as well just to give a lot
of definition and sculpting to the face
and then after that I'm going to put
mascara on the bottom lashes
if you're curious I'm using Lancome
Hypnose if you don't have long bottom
lashes you can totally skip this step
it's not crazy important but might look
weird without it then I'm going to use
Mac peaches blush this is a matte blush
it's got like an orange e coral in it
I'm going to use a this is a 129 brush
by Mac but you know they're all the same
like I said all these brands have the
same brushes and I'm going to blend that
in on the apples of my cheeks and mix it
with that bronzer to make it look really
flawless then I'm
going to use hard candy this is the Tiki
bronzer highlighter whatever and I'm
going to use a big fan brush to
highlight in my cheekbones I found out
that this has mineral oil in it I looked
at the ingredients and I'm really really
sad because this highlighter is
absolutely gorgeous right now so I'm in
a sticky situation I don't know what to
do okay I'm going to use coast outreach
this is an eyeliner it's an eye Kohl by
Mac and I line my waterline with it and
it's this beautiful red color if you
have light eyes even brown eyes Kim
Kardashian used to wear this all the
time it is so beautiful but I knew that
a lot of you aren't going to have this
red eyeliner or this exact shade so I
just wanted to show it to you I'm going
to cover up with a black eye Kohl
because everyone has that so you can see
what it looks like with black now I'm
going to use two joysticks by the
Kardashian line chroma one is in baby
doll and one is in unnatural and I'm
going to put both of them on my lips
together to get a nice nude shade I
don't like things super super washed out
nude so to me this is pretty much as
nude as I go and then I'm going to go
back and do some touch-ups just to blend
all that eye shadow out once again just
using any any blending brush just to
make sure there's no lines and then I'm
going to set everything with Urban Decay
makeup spray and we are done I hope you
enjoy guys and I will see you soon ma
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
