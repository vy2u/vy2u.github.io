tutorial on this look right eeeh I have
absolutely no idea what I'm calling this
I came up with this look a couple of
weeks ago when I was playing around with
some new shadows that are gonna be
launching soon and I just got so
inspired by this lid color and I've seen
a ton of requests recently for a
colorful makeup looks I definitely
haven't done one in a while so I wanted
to throw together a colorful look for
you guys while still trying to keep it
kind of fall appropriate even though
we're working with like this greenish
blue and purples I wanted to make it
feel like fall time so that's what I was
kind of going for with this look right
here and I know that I have been going
through a really intense smokey phase
recently like I have been into like
strong cat eyes and smokey eyes and dark
vampy lips I know very over-the-top
dramatic makeup um so today with this
colorful look even though I did
something really colorful and bold I
wanted to incorporate a white eyeliner
on my lower lash line and I keep it
really bright in the inner corner to
kind of brighten it up even though it's
smoky and then pair a nude lip with it
it's just a phase I'm going through
right now smokey eyes but don't worry I
will be incorporating more daytime fall
looks on my channel very soon I just had
to get these dark intense avanthi looks
out of my system before jumping in the
video I really quickly say thank you to
my subscribers I notice my sound totally
random but I've just noticed the past
couple of weeks I have been receiving
just so much love and positivity from
you guys and I just don't want you to
ever think that I'm not noticing or I'm
taking it for granted or overlooking it
and I just want to say thank you too I
feel like every single time I log on or
Twitter every single time I log into
Instagram all I see is just positivity
and I say thank you because I personally
feel like right now is the happiest I've
ever been in my life this past a month
or two I feel like I finally got into a
place where I'm like fully coming into
who I am as a woman and as a person and
I've just never been this happy and
there's just been so much there's such a
rollercoaster you know life is such a
roller coaster for everyone and I just
feel like finally things have kind of
settled down and my anxiety has kind of
gotten itself together and things have
just done itself together and I
especially thank you to you guys I know
it's so random but your positivity and
your encouragement and your love truly
is such a big thing and such a big part
of me and I want to say thank you for
that because you guys encouraged me to
be the best person I can be and to be a
better person every single day so I
thank God for you and I just
hope that I can bring some sort of
positivity to your life because you guys
sure are doing it to me so thank you so
much I'm sorry if I'm a big ball of
cheese you know I love a mozzarella so
that's it I love you guys so much and I
hope you enjoy this look and I'll see
you soon
bye guys so my eyes are already primed
and the first thing I do is go in with
this eye shadow by makeup geek in the
shade desert sands it's one of my
favorite shadows at the moment and using
a sigma e40 brush i'm going to begin
putting this in my crease using it as my
transition shade I'm going to make sure
I bring this all the way into the inner
corner the inner tear-duct of my eye all
the way to the outer corner and really
buff upward in small circular motions
that way when we go in with the darker
shades this will kind of surround and
halo all the darker shades to really
make it look blended out now we're going
to go in with Poppy again this is by
makeup geek these are all makeup geek
shadows today which was totally by
accident but they are my favorite so
using poppy I'm going to keep this one a
little bit more just on the outer corner
of the eye I'm not going to bring this
one in as far as I do with desert sands
I am bringing and as you see but not as
intensely to the inner corner of the eye
as I did with the first desert sands
shade so I'm putting that on the outer
corner and then working up towards the
tail of the brow just to give this a
little bit more warmth and a little bit
more pop and then I will go over a
million times to make sure to blend it
out now I'm going to go in with these
two new matte shades and these are in
the shade curfew and Motown they are
both dark matte purples and I couldn't
decide which one I wanted to use so I
just mix them together because they're
both so pretty so using a morphe m43 3
brush which is a great blending brush
I'm going to apply this in the outer
corner of my eye and I'm going to make
kind of a circular motion as you can see
I initially put the dark purple in the
very outer corner and then I start to
kind of swoop it up and around to create
the shape that I want for my eye if you
want more of a cat eye you can create
that shape now I wanted this to be a
little bit more rounded out for that
smokier effect but you can create
whatever shape you want so once you
initially have that purple put in that
outer crease of the eye then you can
begin to blend it out whenever it's time
to blend I always try to make sure that
there's not tons of products on my brush
because you will blend a lot easier so
as you can see I'm going back in with
the Sigma e-40 nothing on it and just
kind of going over everything to make
sure that we don't have any harsh lines
now I'm going to go in with
this beautiful duochrome eyeshadow in
the shade Sahara and I'm going to give a
little bit of fix+
spritz on my brush this is going to
dampen the brush it has glycerin in this
product so it's going to make it stick
on it's going to make it look a little
more foiled and intense and look at how
beautiful this shadow is which was one
application it is so gorgeous and
because it's a duochrome
it reflects so many different colors it
has like a little bit purple in it it
has some teal it has a little bit
emerald it's so many different shades in
this one color it's just beautiful it's
my favorite duochrome shadow hands-down
I think it's so gorgeous there's so many
different ways to wear this so that's
what inspired this look overall was just
this color right here and by the way
this shadow is called Secret Garden in
case I didn't mention that so I'm using
a Mac 242 brush and I'm just going to
put this all over the entire lid I only
dampen my brush once by the way just two
squirts and that's it I do not continue
to read Anthon those two squirts are
more than enough for the entire lid now
I'm going to go in with make a big
foiled shadow I wasn't really planning
on doing this but I decided to so this
is a really intense purple shade it's
called Caitlin rose and I am going to be
using a pencil brush by morphe this is
the e 16 and then once I have applied
that just in the outer crease kind of
where desert sands and poppy and those
purples meet up with Secret Garden
that's why I'm going to place that
intense purple and then I'm going to be
blending it out with an e 22 again by
morphe I just wanted a little bit more
pop I felt like the outer corner wasn't
giving me like enough life and I needed
to add a little bit more so that's what
I did now we're gonna go in with
Rapunzel this is another new matte shade
but honestly I would not consider this a
full matte it's not like mad as can be
it's a beautiful brow highlight because
it has a little bit of glisten to it
it's just gorgeous this would be a great
all-over lid shade if you're someone who
doesn't want a frosty color but doesn't
want something that's fully matte it is
really beautiful I would consider this a
big time staple in anyone's makeup
collection now we're gonna go in with
lashes and I am using violet Voss lashes
in the style black magic I've never
tried violet Voss mash laughs violet
Voss lashes before these were sent to me
so I thought that I had a game a try
they're so beautiful and I really really
love this style
now I'm priming the skin using
f.cuz backlight priming filter I raved
about this in my favorites video it has
a beautiful luminosity to it which is
why I love it if you're dry and looking
for a luminous glow I highly recommend
this primer it is just so beautiful and
then I'm going to be going in with an
oldie but a goodie for me and this is
the co Gendo aqua foundation and I'm
going to be applying this today with a
brush by Tarte this is my first time
using this brush and I love it it's just
like so big and fat and it was just
sitting there on my desk and I was like
hey let's try this and it worked great
it applied everything so quickly because
it's so fat and I love the way it buffed
everything out so yeah that is what I'm
using to applies applies man I'm sorry
I'm a little under the weather I can't
speak properly today apply my foundation
now I'm going to be using under-eye
concealer and I'm using the urban decay
wait list full coverage concealer this
is never going to change I swear this is
my favorite concealer of all time it is
so difficult for me to try anything new
because this is like my ride-or-die I've
never used it found a concealer I've
loved this much in my entire life I'm so
dedicated to it so I'm blending that out
with the real techniques sponge and then
as always I will set the under-eye and I
am using the Kat Von D shade light
palette to set my under eye area today
because these are some of my favorite
shadows I'm sorry
favorites powders ever for the under eye
area they're so smooth and creamy and
they have a lot of coverage so I usually
use the yellow one which is a little bit
of the peach mixed in I just think that
they're such a beautiful formula now I'm
going to be filling in my brows as
always using Anastasia brow Wiz but
today I am using a different shade than
normal I normally use taupe but now I'm
going to be using chocolate I feel like
since my hair is darker I needed a
little bit of a warmer color but the
shade is a lot darker so I had to try to
be as light handed as possible so my
brows match my hair a little bit but I
never want to match them perfectly
because that's just not my style and red
brows don't look cute on me I promise
you I'm going to be contouring now using
hoola bronzer by benefit another oldie
but a goodie and I am using the NARS
eita brush oh this is giving me old
school vibes for my contour video the
eita brush and the hoola bronzer good
times somes going to be sculpting my
face using the eater brush starting
towards the top of the ear bringing it
down towards the corner of the mouth but
not all the way to the corner of the
mouth
then I am taking an e for brush by
morphe which is just a great rounded
brush to really blend things out I'm
gonna put some of that right around the
hairline but not too strongly because
you can easily get too strong and then
look like you have like the striper
bronzer on your forehead and then for
blush I'm going to go in with NARS gilda
and I am going to be using an e 3 from
morphe from the elite collection to
apply this blush it's just like a nice
peachy blush it's really pretty it's one
of my favorite from NARS and then I'm
going to be going in again with this
dark dark purple this is Motown I'm
going to be applying that to lo my lower
lash line using a flat definer brush I
don't know if this specific one I'm
using is from Sigma or morphe because
they both have like the exact same brush
I'm going to apply that on just the
outer third of the eye and then I'm
going to blend it out with desert sands
again by makeup geek any pencil brush
will do I believe this one is from
Sedona lace and then I was going to go
back and forth and blend that out and
kind of buff it down a little bit so we
don't have any harsh lines but again I'm
only focusing this on the outer corner
of the lash line and I'm going to go in
with that other purple and this is um
curfew and I'm going to bring a little
bit of that purple in as well because I
feel like it wasn't giving me enough
depth underneath the eye so I wanted to
bring a little bit more of a lighter
purple in now I'm gonna take Mac Pro
emphasize highlighting powder and I
usually use this underneath my eye area
but since I use a kat von d palette
today I'm going to be using this on the
inner corner of the lower lash line
because I really wanted to make the
inner corner nice and bright I'm using
the e36 from morphe to do this which is
one of my favorite brushes I think it's
like the most underrated brush but I
love it because it's so tiny and so
precise then I'm going to coat my lower
lash line with a little bit of a pale
liner and this is the nw20 chromo
graphic pencil I believe from Mac and
I'm going to just go over it with a
little bit more of that emphasize to
really make sure that it's really nice
and bright in that inner corner to
brighten up this eye look now I'm going
to use a Ramona accelerator and I'm
going to just coat my lower lashes with
a coat of mascara you guys know how to
do this been there done that and then
I'm going to use hourglass ambient
lighting powder in the shade luminous
light and I'm going to drag this all
along my cheekbones I really wanted to
get like that glow from within
going today but you know what it
wouldn't be a tutorial of mine unless I
use a little bit of champagne pop listen
guys I know it's redundant but this is
my baby and I'm going to use it while I
can cuz it's not going to be around
forever so I'm going to pop it just on
the very high points of the cheekbones
only and then the rest of the cheeks I
will let the luminous light do the
talking now for the lips I'm just going
to use the Marc Jacobs gloss and sugar
rimmed which is one of my favorite new
glosses ever it's just so glossy so
pretty such a gorgeous nude I just love
it so I'm gonna coat my lips with that
and then I am going to use some
Anastasia clear brow gel to make sure
that my brows don't take flight because
my brow hairs have a mind of their own I
swear to you and then last but not least
I'm going to set my entire face with
Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray
and then we're done I hope you guys
enjoy this look thank you so much for
watching I love you guys and I'll see
you soon bye
