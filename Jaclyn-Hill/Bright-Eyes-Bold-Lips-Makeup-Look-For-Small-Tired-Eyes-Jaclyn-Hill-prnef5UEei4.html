hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
a makeup tutorial on this look right
here do you love it so I posted a photo
of myself yesterday on Instagram I'm
gonna pull it up it was this one Oh
anyways so I posted this photo of myself
on Instagram yesterday and I had so many
responses from you guys asking me to do
a makeup tutorial on this I look so I
got on snapchat and I asked you guys if
you really really wanted to see it
because I've just done so many neutral
looks recently and I just felt like I
want to do another neutral eye look it's
just it's too much right now I need to
mix it up I need to do a super colorful
tutorial next and I have a really fun
smoky colorful eye look that I will be
doing next but I can't film it until
three days from now because I just very
busy these next few days and I have
people coming into town and staying with
me my house so moving on so I asked you
guys if you would like to see this
neutral look and I like how important it
was to you and pretty much every single
person that responded told me that they
really wanted to see this eye look so
that is what we're doing your wish is my
command so the reason I did this look in
the first place was yesterday morning I
was getting ready for the day and the
day before that I had been crying like
all day and my eyes were so puffy from
crying I woke up and I felt like I had a
like peel each eyelid open because
they're like so puffy and swollen shut
so I wanted to do something that really
made my eyes look open and bright and
fresh because I was not about to rock
with smokey eye with my puffy eyes I'd
be like hey guys panda bear status sorry
if you can hear the like lawnmower
people outside it's really loud and it's
I can't hear my own thoughts it's gave
me anxiety
so anyways because I was trying to
defeat and overcome my puffy eyes I did
this look and I am absolutely in love
with it so for those of you who have
small eyes this makeup look will be
absolutely ideal for you because it's
definitely going to open them up make
you look very fresh and awake or maybe
if you've just been crying or maybe you
ate tons of sodium and your eyes are all
puffy when you wake up this is going to
a very eye opening very bright fresh
feminine look I absolutely love it and I
did pair it with a bold lip unlike my
photo that I posted yesterday because
this eye look will match any lip in the
world because it's just neutral so yeah
I hope that you guys enjoy this makeup
tutorial I will see you very soon with a
very bright fun look and I'm super
excited about okay I'm not talking I
love you guys I'll see you soon bye good
morning my love's I have missed you guys
and I'm excited to film this video as
you can totally tell I'm going to start
off by priming at my skin today I am
using makeup forever
step 1 smoothing primer I have been
absolutely in love with this primer
recently I use it mainly just in my
t-zone because that's the area that I
really want to smooth but if you have
imperfections fine lines pores this is
amazing fulfilling those in and going on
with foundation you guys I can't even
talk about this brush right now I am
seriously so in love with this
foundation brush it is my new baby this
is the morphe m43 9 obsession does not
even cover how obsessed I am with this
brush so I'm going to be spritzing mac
fix+
all over this brush just so that when I
go in with my foundation it's going to
kind of share it out a little bit and
give it a really dewy healthy-looking
finish and today I'm going to be using
this foundation buy at the brand I
believe it's pronounced bourgeois I'm
not totally positive but I'll link it
down below for you guys I have been
using this foundation everyday for about
the past three weeks I absolutely love
it it is so natural looking on the skin
one of my absolute favorites especially
for summertime then I'm going to go in
and I am going to conceal conceal don't
feel no just me okay I'm going to
conceal the entire under eye area with
the naked weightless skin concealer by
Urban Decay and I am going to damp that
damp that I'm going to blend that out
with a damp Beauty Blender make sure you
squeeze it and get it completely soaking
wet underneath the faucet and then wring
it out with like a towel and then go and
blend everything out a damn Beauty
Blender is my favorite way to blend out
concealer it's just so easy and
foolproof and quick and it just helps
everything look natural it absorbs any
excess product I just swear I stand by
the Beauty Blender I absolutely adore it
so I'm also concealing other areas of
the face just for highlighting purposes
and covering up some redness that we
don't need around the nose area then as
always I'm going to set my under eye
concealer today I'm using the Anastasia
banana powder which is sold on her
website and it also comes in the
original contour
kit that you can get at like Sephora but
I'm just using that to set because I
don't want to go super highlighted today
but I do need to just set that area so
that I don't become a Creasy disaster I
also set my forehead in the center of my
t-zone lightly just to even out that
highlight now I'm going to go in with
Bobbi Brown toast one of my favorite
colors ever it is similar it's like a
makeup geek beaches and cream or like a
peach smoothie it's just a beautiful
shade I'm going in with a sigma e40
brush I'm going to just blend that all
over this entire crease area and on the
outer corner I am kind of smoking it out
just a little bit because I like to
accentuate the outer corner more so than
the middle of the eye I'm going to go in
with a new eyeshadow by anastasiya and
this is in a shade fawn I love this
color because it's not too warm and it's
not too cool so if you are someone who
let's say is extremely fair and you want
to try warm tones which are too scared
to go too warm this will be a great
shade for you to start off with because
it's not too warm like I said it's a
great neutral Brown and so I am just
using that on the outer corner of the
eye it with a sigma e25 then going back
in with the fluffy brush I'm just
blending out so we have no harsh lines
but I will go back and forth between
those two brushes just to get that
pigmentation to the depth that I want it
to and just to continue to blend it out
I go back and forth between these two
brushes probably three or four times
until I'm satisfied with the blending
and the pigmentation now I'm going to go
in with a newer eyeshadow from makeup
geek and this is in the shade Rapunzel I
love this eyeshadow you guys I am using
a sigma e55 to apply this I love this
color as you can see on camera it is
such an amazing neutral everyday shadow
it's not frosty which is great but it's
not totally matte it has just a little
bit of a shimmer it's beautiful it would
look great on pretty much everybody
now I'm going with that exact same Phan
shade by Anastasia on my lower lash line
as you can see I'm only putting it on
the outer corner I'm not going to bring
this shade into the inner corner only
about halfway or three-quarters of the
way in on that outer corner and then
just walk away walk away then I'm going
to go in with the shade mylar this is
from Mac and I'm using a teeny tiny
precision brush which is also from Mac
to highlight my inner corner I'm going
to Pat this baby on I didn't want to do
anything too frosty but if you want to
you can I chose mylar because it's more
of a satin shade where it's not totally
matte but it's not frosty and I
going to heavily pack that on on the
entire inner corner blending up on the
lid and really bringing it to meet that
Brown that we put on the lower lash line
this is what's going to make this look
different from any others because it is
going to make those eyes pop in the end
and really have that doe-eyed effect now
I am going to go in with a black liner
and what do you know it's Maybelline gel
liner and blackest black as always I'm
going to just use my go-to eyeliner
brush from Sigma and I'm going to do the
tiniest little line of liner that I can
possibly do because I love my thick
lines and I love my cat eye I love my
wings and I'm not doing a wing today
which is so weird to see myself like
this but I really love it so once we've
done that I'm going to go in with my
completely busted up eyes shadow
this is embarked from Mac it's just a
super dark brown kind of a purpley Brown
and I'm going to take that and put on my
lower lash line using a definer brush
again I am NOT going to bring this into
far I'm literally just going to tap it
on that lower lash line right up next to
my lashes wiggle wiggle wiggle back and
forth and that is it and walk away I
just want to define that lower lash line
on the outer corner because again this
is going to make the eyes look bigger
the darker you make that outer corner
the more it's going to open up the eyes
and the brighter you make the inner
corner the more it's going to open up
the eyes now I'm going in with a Mac
chroma graphic pencil this is a pro item
but I'll link it down below for you guys
on their website I'm using the number
nw20
it's a beautiful creamy nude shade and
again this will make your eyes really
look open and fresh I love this creamy
nude shade it's like one of my favorite
colors for the waterline ever I'm just
gonna coat my lashes with mascara
because I am going to apply falsies in a
second but first I'm filling in my brows
but we've seen me do my brows I feel
like 500 times so we're gonna skip
through that really quickly because I
don't think it's entertaining so voila
we're done with brows if only it were
that easy oh my god I wish brows are
like my least favorite thing to do on my
face oh did I just say that I did it's
like a sin anyways now I'm gonna dust
just a little bit of that mylar
eyeshadow on my brow bone as well and
then we are going to go in with the
lashes that in my opinion make this look
complete
these are House of lashes iconic lashes
oh my god could you die as I'm putting
them on I'm just looking at myself in
the mirror like this has got to be a
joke right this has got
to be a joke these lashes are everything
they're my new favorite lashes I don't
know why it took me so long to jump on
the bandwagon but listen I'm on the
bandwagon in house of lashes iconic is
happening I coat my lower lashes with
Mac gigablack lash and now I'm going to
go ahead and bronze my face like you
have never seen me bronze before I'm
going to pack on about 25 pounds of
bronzer and we're totally going to roll
with it I am using the makeup forever
bronzer and the shade three five one I
believe it is and I am using a really
big oversized brush this is a Tom Ford
brush but this is not a necessary brush
yes I love it but it's not necessary you
guys there's many other brushes out
there that will do the exact same thing
you do not need to spend the money on
this once I have bronze my face I'm then
going to go in with just a little bit of
a lighter powder I am using the Kat Von
D shade light palette and I'm using one
of those highlight colors just to kind
of carve out that lower area because the
bronzer can sometimes fall too low and
kind of make my face look too round so I
just lightly sculpt out to bring back
definition now I'm going to go in with
the morphe 9b blush palette I raved
about this in my favorites video and I
have not put it down you guys I love it
you can see how crazy pigmented it is
like literally one tap and you are good
to go it's intense but I absolutely love
it so as you can see it is SuperDuper
pigmented so I will take my time kind of
blending it out I'm going back and with
that brush because I was a little
heavy-handed today not gonna lie but
we're going to make it work and we're
going to make it to work so I'm going in
with mary-lou manizer by the balm
beautiful highlight this is a
ride-or-die
absolutely gorgeous a very pure vanilla
shade and I am using a morphe m50 one to
highlight my cheeks this is my favorite
highlighting brush ever ever so I'm
going to bring that down on the apples
of the cheeks as well to really give
that nice summery fresh glow I don't
always bring it down on my cheeks but I
really do when I want to look very nice
and fresh and dewy and summer
appropriate now for the lips I wanted to
do something bold I always do new but I
want to do something different today and
I was absolutely in love with this new
Anastacio liquid lipstick in the shade
craft so that's what I'm using right now
I'm lining my lips with a makeup forever
lip liner in this shade 10c it is like a
perfect match to Kraft I'm lining my
lips normally and then on the upper lip
I will over line it just a tiny bit so
that it matches my lower lip but that's
totally just personal preference you do
you boo so now I'm going to go in with
and as you can see it is like the exact
same matches that liner they're a match
made in heaven
I love this color so much I wore out
after I filmed this video and I got
three compliments on it which is a
pretty good amount of compliments on my
lip color if you ask me so a round of
applause for Anastacio and claudia
gorgeous lip color I'm going to set my
face with fix+ from Mac just to give a
dewy glow and we are all finished I hope
you enjoyed this tutorial you guys thank
you so much for watching I love you you
know it's true and I'll see you soon bye
