video today I know that I just started
off by screaming your face like oh I got
a brand new camera any new microphone so
I am like a kid in a candy shop right
now I am so so so happy because I have
been having so many issues with my
recent camera now which is my old camera
so many issues of it and it described me
crazy is like doing snorting so much um
but it just drive me crazy because I
never want to like really fill these are
just so frustrated by the fact that it's
like I'm never really alone I'm always
blurry like it's off-camera like I'm
constantly having to focus it was using
like makeup brushes I'll rather make the
process like reach out and focus it or
I've use a little remote which broke
while zone but anyways long story short
I got a new microphone a new camera so
my audio and my visual should definitely
upgrade for you guys I'm so excited
about oh my god and this camera actually
autofocuses watch are you ready like
seriously catania camera autofocus on my
wits of me so long what's the health of
people up and I'm gonna stop babbling
well anyways recently I have been in a
really bronzy kind of makeups mood I
feel like summer coming up around the
corner I'm just feeling very bronzy
alcohol so original Japanese in the
corner outside super brown face
it was so perfect because I had no idea
this palette was coming out in the first
place and I got an email yesterday when
I opened up what I lost my mind I was
like it's like more because no it's my
mood update like result connected look
at the salad
didn't we just please take a moment look
at this palette this is the new at 35
our palette it walks it on Tuesday this
was supposed to be kind of a surprise
launch station like they had to
advertise their talked about it they
just kind of wanted to drop it and let
the world have it holy guacamole
this palette has 15 shimmer 18 max and
in two seconds
and I love that all of the shimmer are
right here you can see all of them like
together I just really really love that
layout you can see all the masses of
suits that is right there it's so so
beautiful let me show you it compared to
the skirts that the three by oh because
this is I'm sure their best seller
right here and I want to be able to see
the difference in comparison so you can
kind of get to know the new palette I
personally think that this one is
definitely giving this 3/5 a run for its
money and I'm suing this is gonna need a
new best seller because when I open this
it like took my breath away it is so
freaking beautiful that I love this the
3/5 hoes definitely have more v4g colors
right here along side but I think
overall I like the colors better in this
entire palette like I've told you guys
before how in this palette I usually
stick in this region right here only
because it's hid the warm region of the
palette where I did palette I'm like the
whole thing is freaking gorgeous Georgia
to me not but could you just know it I
am legit have so many of these three
Philo's I think I own like five maybe
six or seven of these to flow around my
house between my house and my office
because it genuinely is one of my
favorite makeup you guys I really can't
do this all right
my face is already primed and good to go
already for the beat I'm going to be
using the same foundation I used in my
last video might get ready with me and
this is the Dior forever foundation it's
set on here if it is everlasting we're
in pore refining effect and I'm telling
you guys I work all day Busch Gardens I
could not even believe how beautiful
this looks on my skin so many people
were asking on my get ready with me how
I felt about the foundation at the end
of a long day and you guys I loved it
like my sister's kept complimenting my
makeup all day along with not assuming
my makeup application like my eyeshadow
or anything but my skin like all day
they cut mean like Chaplin how is your
foundation still look so perfect because
in the middle the afternoon it did get
really hot here in the direct Sun so all
of us were like definitely sweaty and I
thinking of our jackets and you know
like riding roller coasters and all that
jazz so get out of the day like after
being at an amusement park for like
seven and a half hours we were all like
worn down and I'm telling you like not
feel like Brad or like to my own horn
anyway because it has nothing to do with
like what I did it's just like my makeup
still looks perfect like perfect like my
sisters would not stop talking about it
they're like how is this local person
like you guys the foundation is like
voodoo
it is so so fragrant that when I
why I can smell on my face by the first
several minutes I feel like all these
boozy brands like over fragrance
everything like Chanel your YSL it's all
their makeup all their cosmetics smells
so strong gun clicks all right I'm going
to go in with the heart-shaped it
concealer of course in the shade
light/medium honey I hat might be a
little eye I'm going to mix um medium
with it
gosh like the light I had someone leave
a comment a couple of weeks ago
complaining about me using this
heart-shaped fit concealer too much is
telling me that they are so sick of
seeing me use the same concealer over
and over and I'll just kind of like
sound like personal problems all the
girls and boys out there who are makeup
obsessed you here not make it look stuff
even if you're just like an average
woman which is weird make it every once
in a while you know how hard it is to
find that amazing right or dive perfect
concealer way for me concealer and
foundation is like jeans it is so hard
to find that perfect pair of jeans and
once you find them like you're so right
or die for them and that's how
foundation is kansui dar speaking of
comments though on my last video I was
getting so many comments about me having
too much filler or too much Botox or
whatever it may be just making comments
on my face which by the way let me just
say I feel like no one had manners
anymore like the fact people just think
it's okay to call myself as a parent I'm
just like what like I don't know I was
raised differently than that just
commenting on a woman a moment
appearance man or woman it's never okay
well as far as filler and Botox goes I
have always from the very beginning bit
off with you guys like why would I not
be like you guys seeing every single day
on YouTube and on snapchat Instagram
like obviously my face is going to make
some changes I'm going to talk about it
like a mock invade my ex Mullen for like
no reason and I expect this all the time
we can see the people out there who have
worked on that when you celebrities deny
getting work done it's like so pathetic
like I've been on to be like everything
I've gotten done yes I've gotten to
where my listing yes I have to learn my
undereye I mean yes I got some killer
right here in my nose I hated my protein
nose like I'm insecure by every time it
was broken when I was 13 years old and
guess what I'm allowed to Dixie sings
I'm gonna have to do this come on I do
whatever works my body not yours mine
and if you don't want to look at it
you'll have to like you can X out of
this video
it's like I am very much croelick do you
boo whatever is going to make you happy
I like to do it but no one ever had
surgery yes my face has rounded out I've
gained a lot of weight like a lot of
weight from my body
so yeah I've changed and I really don't
like like my face looks right now and it
definitely isn't insecurity of mine so
when everyone else brings it up it's
just like yes and all the filler that I
have have done is old news at this point
you know it's like that was eight months
ago it's not like I went out and did it
last week and it's like the name changed
but the only thing that's changed in the
past eight months is my weight game like
they don't really bother me but still
it's just like can we don't be so ruined
just like demanding I'm gonna go and set
my face a little powder the other day
and my get ready with me video unless
people are asking what powder brush this
is and it is a lemare powder brush they
send it to me I would have never bought
this on my own in the first place I
didn't know anything about it they send
me and I'll just look so nice and it is
I hadn't look at the price I'm sure it's
ridiculously expensive so that's why I'm
using it because they affect me for free
so thank you so much to lemare for doing
this so do not feel like you need to buy
a little air powder brush to get a
beautiful finish because you don't I'm
going to fill in the bushes real quick
let me just grab my brow definer and I'm
going to skip past this part for you
guys because Mel and my talking people
fill in the brows harness okay so now
I'm going to go in with the star of the
show the new 35 are I'm going to go in
with this matte Brown right here
initially in my crease I'm going to go
in with the our 37 this is from the
morphe Rose Bowl collection I talked
about in my last video I have been
obsessed with this brush recently I use
it always okay pigment how are you I use
it every single time as my makeup to
apply in the first shadow and my crease
now no there's something about it even
but really fluffy but it's got a little
bit like a point like a tapered miss at
the very end and it just gets in there
nice and tight but it also just blend it
out so smoothly
I swear morphe shadows keep getting
better and better every single pallet
like every time they cross into pallet I
feel like the shadows are creamier and
more pigmented than they were before and
I know that a lot of you guys say as
well as the the comments and the tweets
that you guys send to me talking about
more feet and I see that comment all the
time from people saying how the quality
is just getting better and better and I
completely agree
all right now I'm going to go in with
just cuz I want to go through I'm gonna
go this one I get it's kind of a baby
pukey brown but it's subtle it's not
like really intense like a look of a
lighter my gosh that's pretty color and
I'm just going to pass that on right
over top of that everyone has their own
opinion as far as like packing on
eyeshadow over a couple more eyeshadows
doing layers some people don't like it
some people do some makeup artists think
it's very necessary and like crucial in
the makeup application to really get
like that three-dimensional look and
have it really blended which I am or
those people I totally agree that advant
blend more colors together like the
eyeshadow starts to look more and more
and more blended but if you are someone
who you just want to do like one or two
eyes house can be done you can totally
do that as well I do think that you get
an overall more flawless finish when you
use a couple different eyeshadows to
blend everything out I'm going to grab
an angle brush and just stamp some
translucent powder right here you're
going to see me do this several times is
quickly become a like key step in my
makeup application any kind of doing
anything smoky whatsoever I always do
this step because I'm telling you like
it is just a dream it makes the
application so easy and just gives me
that desired look that I want without
having to use any scotch tape or pull it
my skin or let clean anything up like
this just does all the work for me I
love it I'm going to grab this color
right here Jessie and I'm so
ridiculously drawn to it to me it was
exactly like Mac's texture which is one
of my all-time favorites if you guys
remember the days where I was obsessed
matte textured and you really are od
beautiful like it even has the same very
slight
trimmer and it like Matt captured it the
orange undertone it still pretty I'm
going to go in with this color right
here it's like a chocolatey bronzy color
these are definitely way more coppery
but I want to go in with that chocolate
color I actually love love love this
color right down here because it's like
a really really dark chocolate was like
a black tint in it but for today's look
I have like have a look in mine and I
want to go with that this one unless I'm
going to break my brush for some
six-plus I swear I don't even go in with
shimmer shadows anymore unless I spray
my brush with this plus like that
supports come to me my friend Jackson
whirring after the night famous makeup
and she was saying the same thing she
would you ever apply makeup any more
like just regular shimmer just upgrade
your brush I like no never to me tail
like it just become such a habit cookies
make everything so metallic I'm bringing
a dark color all the way over on the
outer portion so that my entire lid has
that shimmer I'm going to grab this
color at the very bottom and the very
center of the palette is this really
dark matte kind of chocolatey color got
a little of a purple the undertones and
I'm going to just tap that right in that
outer corner area then I'm going to do
is grab a different brush this is be
more p.m. for one one who looks like
this I'm going to go in with this color
right here again I'm going to scoop a
little bit of that up tap off the excess
and I'm just going to go right here in
that area and just make sure we have no
harsh lines
I'm going to go back down that flat
definer brush this is a math 242 I'm
going to pick up this color right here
this is screaming my name this is
gorgeous
like sunshine gold I'm going to lightly
tap that right in this area kind of the
transition between those two grounds Oh
get it to me I'm gonna grab a brush and
just wipe this translucent powder away
all right I'm going to get to work on
that lower lash line and I start off
with this shade or right here I'm going
to do this on the entire lower lash line
always in the are corner to inner corner
you know I love a good blown out lower
lash line I'm going to grab that dark
brown once again on a just finer brush
this time and this is a sigma e 16 and
putting this right on my lash line and
nice and close just going back in with
that pencil brush and I am just blending
all of that together alright so now I'm
going to go back in and grab a little
bit more of this yellow me golden shade
because I am just so beyond traffic to
this color I'm going to get my brush and
nice and wet with some fix+ I'm going to
put that my lower lash line actually
going to put it right in the very center
of the lower lash right underneath my
eye I'm going to grab some this shade
right here this is the lightest shimmer
and the palette I'm going to use that to
highlight my brow bone and see how it
goes
I might not like it because I am so
what's safety about the highlight that I
use in my brow bone oh that actually is
really nice lift up I'm honestly shocked
right now look I am so picky about my
brow bone highlight vinaigrette one need
Marc Jacobs eyeliners in a shade miracle
and therefore am I
I don't know the middle of this Vermont
but let's just try it and see what
happens
it's weird like I can't really see it
like it's definitely on and I saw go on
but I don't know it doesn't like have a
pop okay what's a pop what I'm going to
do is I'm actually going to grab that
yellow gold I've been loving so much
from this palette and then get a little
brush in it and I'm going to just gently
put it right there on my waterline yeah
babe yes I'm talking about I'm going to
throw some false lashes on it I will be
right all right so I applied some slave
eyelashes to my eyes i slor' because
they are one of my favorite pairs ever
and they're so comfortable and I just
apply some mascara to my lower lashes as
well alright so now I want to broaden
the head on my face I'm going to go in
with a Marc Jacobs Olmedo bronzer I fell
in love with this after repurchasing
that you guys like I really remember but
I own it a couple years ago and I didn't
like it like I just tried one time and
for some reason did it like it and then
Manny said that it is like the best
bronzer ever if Elvis okay let me give
it one more shot because me and Nana use
a pretty similar taste in makeup I'm
obsessed I absolutely love it I don't
know why I like the first fun bye love
love love it
I have not more yet though with my spray
key on I only have worn it around really
fair I don't know how it's gonna look so
let's find out
yay it were it browsing me
oh my gosh I'm so dumb I have this brush
sitting right next to another brush that
has black all over and look can you see
my brush head black all over it and Adam
appliance my bronzer is like so choppy
and muddy looking okay it's not that bad
this could be worth doing okay um let me
think okay I'm gonna take it's a blank
brush and just go over everything
haha alright I'm going to take some
translucent powder i feeding my cover up
extract enough power and I'm just going
to go under here and clean up a bit I'm
still mad at my forehead I'm going to
pop on to the inner corner highlight
using the Oprah Beverly Hills
highlighter alright I'm going to go in
and dust this hot mess away again for
highlight I got the new Oprah and
nikkietutorials collection is a
highlight and three liquid lipsticks I'm
so happy for her congratulations to you
Nicki I cannot wait to try this
highlight but I swear she has a box on
camera cause look how pretty is I want
you to turn it on so cool such a great
idea so there's a light shade like a
medium golden color and a copper shade
got the very advances three front colors
I'm sure if you roll it all together it
would be beautiful if you were feeling
Baldy I'm going to pick up this golden
shade right there I'm just going to do
that one by itself let me just wiggle my
little brush around in there yes tane
gorgeous
then I grab a tiny bit of white oh yes
alright so on their lips I applied the
Oprah and nikkietutorials liquid
lipstick in the shade
dude potion and then I applied a gloss
over top because it does have like a
purpley pinkish undertone in it it looks
like that so pretty but I wanted
something that had a little bit more of
a brownish pink on my lips with this
bronze look so I applied the
bareMinerals gloss in the shade fly
right over top of it alright guys so
this is the completed look I have
absolutely obsessed with these colors on
my eyes like obsessed with these colors
but I cannot get over like that yellowy
gold like I did not realize how much I
would love that color
I really never used that color of gold
on my eye before I actually go for like
way warmer goal and not social this
sunny goal with like a green undertone
but oh my god I love it so much notice
how I'm not saying anything about the
face because I'm still pissed about my
bronzer so this at least it's not a real
problem in the world but still like
everything I was in the air in place
anyway that I really hope if you like
this kind of casual laid-back makeup
tutorial recently I feel like I don't
