get a look that I get asked all the time
how I did it is so easy it just requires
three eyeshadows some eyeliner and
mascara
um but everywhere I go people tell me
how pretty it is and oh my gosh your
eyeshadow is so gorgeous how'd you do
that
and it's just a really basic bronze
smokey eye and I think it would look
gorgeous on pretty much everybody so if
you want to know how to do it keep on
watching okay so I'm going to start off
by taking this color bronze by Mac it's
this really beautiful bronze color that
looks just like it's called I'm going to
start off by taking that and patting it
all over my lid okay I'm just going to
Pat this all over the lid and I'm not
going to go above the crease and just
keep going back with your brush and
dipping it in and just continue to Pat
and you're gonna have a pretty harsh
line but that's fine and just drag it
all along in there on the outer corners
just kind of barely work with it and
bring it up a little bit higher than the
rest of the lid right there okay so you
have like this sharp line but that's
okay alright now I'm going to take the
shade saddle by Mac mine has hit pan so
it's like running out but it's just a
really pretty warm Brown this color
looks gorgeous on everybody and I'm
going to take a 217 brush by Mac right
here and I did my makeup earlier today
so it's got like some Brown on it from
then and I'm just going to swirl it
around in that color saddle I'm going to
take that and I'm going to blend this
out now once you have that shade saddle
on there you kind of want to tap it like
just kind of like wave it through the
air and hit it on your hand and it'll
get like the main portion of the powder
pigments off of the tip of the brush so
that when you go in it won't be really
thick and jagged and you want to work on
this outer crease at first and see how I
don't have my brush turned like this
because I'll kind of slop it up and
create another harsh line which is what
we're trying to get it rid of right now
so I'm just continuing to go in this
crease bring it over here but you want
to stay deep down you don't
want to be up in this area so we're just
saying deepen that crease and then kind
of turning it sideways now that we've
got that portion blended out and you're
just moving in really smooth
circular motions this brush is like a
miracle worker I could not do my makeup
without it I think Mac for making this
so much okay so that's how that should
look so far so that's how it should look
so far still not smoothed out got some
harsh lines but that's okay because
that's where our 224 brush is for okay
now I'm going to take my 224 brush which
I use every single day of my life again
I'm going to dip it into soft brown
swirl it around in there and get a
generous amount and then just kind of
tap off the excess again and you'll see
a bunch of power like fly out in the air
and now I'm going to go over that right
there I'm going to stay in that same
area I'm not going above it I'm staying
right here but because it's not as dense
it's going to fluff out that color I'm
just going over it and a rainbow motion
and this will just lightly brush it up
remember not to go any higher than right
here you don't want to go up here like
underneath the brow or anything stay low
do the window to the wow-wow to this wet
drop down okay now it should look like
this and you don't have harsh lines
anymore you've defeated that with the
224 brush that we went in with and you
can just keep going until you feel like
you've completely eliminated any lines
that you don't want there you think of
smoky eyes it comes from the word smoke
smoke doesn't stay in one place it
doesn't have harsh lines there's no
beginning there's no end to it it's just
like fluffy and in the air and that's
what you want your smoky eyes to look
like so now that we've achieved that I'm
going to go back in with that first
shade ron's on that exact same brush and
I'm just going to overlap what I already
did in the first place and just push
that all over the lid again
you don't have to be precise with this
just get it on there just to bring that
bronzy shimmer back now we'll go in with
eyeliner alright I'm just going to line
my eyes now I use black track it's a
fluid line it's gel by Mac it looks like
this it's just like goopy um and I just
use a little angled brush the 2:08 right
here I'm going to make this line pretty
thick because that's what's going to
help us with that smoky look
okay so now I have on my eyeliner I'm
going to take that shade that we put in
our crease saddle and I'm going to put
it on a small little pencil brush like
this and I'm going to push it under my
eye area not even looking myself right
now I was just staring up at the ceiling
I was like oh my gosh I hope this is
going okay alright so he's going to keep
smudging this around all right like you
just saw it doesn't have to be like
precise or anything you just want to get
that color under there because then
it'll give a really nice like smoky
appearance okay so now that we have that
smoked out underneath I'm going to curl
my lashes and go in with some mascara
okay so now the eyes are done and you
can leave it like that for like a
evening or daytime look but if you want
to like switch it into nighttime all
you're going to want to do is line your
waterline with an eye pencil I'll line
mine just to demonstrate my favorite is
smoldering eye pencil by Mac nothing
compares to it really I mean it's
amazing and you just want to line it in
here
it's so gross that you have to watch me
do this to my eye so you can see the
difference between the drama of this eye
on the side woo fun ah okay
alright so there
your eyes are complete now let's zoom
out and do the face really quick all I'm
gonna do is just take some bronzer and
I'm just gonna go on my cheeks because
the eyes are so bronzed I don't want to
do anything too intense to kind of take
away from what we have going there
um so I'm just going to line the outer
side of my face staying by the hairline
bringing it down on the cheeks this is
gonna double as my blush
okay so to finish off the look all you
need is some nude lips I'm using hue by
Mac and there you go your look is
complete have fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
