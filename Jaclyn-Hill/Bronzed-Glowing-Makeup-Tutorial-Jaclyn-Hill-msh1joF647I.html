this bronze glowing makeup look this is
something that is so simple and easy to
do I think it is great and extremely
appropriate for the summertime
especially if you're in your you know
teenager and you're going and spending a
lot of time at the beach this is a great
thing to throw together you know if you
have some time to freshen up in the
hotel it's just it's a great look it's
just going to highlight your natural
beauty it's not something that's gonna
be like oh my gosh look at that girl's
makeup but it's just gonna make you look
nice and dewy and fresh and alive so
yeah with that being said I just want to
touch base really quick on my hair
because I've gotten so many questions
every video I posted my hair curled
everyone always asks I am still using
the new me titan-3 curling wand that I
showed in my giveaway and hair tutorial
a few videos ago my coupon codes are
still open for that so if you're
interested in getting a huge discount on
one of the curling irons I will put all
the information below and exactly how to
enter it and if you have any issues I
will put an email address down below
where you can contact them with anything
that you may need um also yes I got it
dyed a lot of you noticed is very very
red I don't know if it looks really red
in this lighting and the Sun it's like
orange I have no idea how to achieve
this out of the salon for like 4 hours
it took so much to get this color so I
don't know how to tell you about that
it's not a box from the drugstore it
took a long process to get here so yeah
alright I will stop talking now and let
you guys get to the video enjoy bye
so today we are going to start off by
priming our face I am using L'Oreal
magic lumi light infusing primer oh say
that five times anyways I'm not using
this so much for the priming power but
I'm using it because as this beautiful
shimmery iridescent glow to it so I'm
going to use my fingers I usually start
in the middle of my face and work my way
outward and that is usually going to
look the best when you go on with
foundation then I'm going to use Mac's
Pro Longwear concealer this is shade NW
20 and I'm going to put this all over
the eye area I like to use the Pro
Longwear concealer because I think it
makes your eyeshadow last all day with
no creasing and it conceals and I really
like to use it in NWS where you have
more of a pink tone rather than NCS I
think that the eye shadow shows it more
true so then I'm going to use Mac's soft
Brown and always hello and then I'm
going to take a fluffy brush this is
from Sigma and I'm going to just toss
this in my crease and the outer crease
I'm going to want it just a little bit
more pigmented than I do in the inner
crease you don't have to be super
precise with this though this is such a
laid-back easy breezy look like you
don't have to be okay I have it really
dark in the crease and light in the
inner corner you just blend it on there
this is just going to be that mid-tone
color just to make everything look much
more blended and flawless so that we
don't have any harsh lines or choppiness
and then I'm going to take this Urban
Decay
Shadow this is called chopper I found
this beautiful gem last night when I was
organizing all of my makeup I originally
purchased this because um Kim
Kardashian's makeup artist joy Spinelli
actually used this on her multiple times
and every time I saw pictures of her
wearing the shadow I could not take my
eyes off of it so I went out and bought
it because of her like really whatever
so I'm going to take the mac 242 brush
which is a synthetic brush so this is
really really going to pack on that
color and the reason I'm not doing my
foundation first is because this color
tends to have a lot of fallout meaning
that the sparkles and the glitter are
going to fall down on my cheekbones and
if I were to have foundation on it would
just make a hot mess out of my cheeks
now I'm just going to take a dab of
texture and I'm using similar colors I
use all the time because so many of you
have told me that you've gone out and
made purchases based on my
recommendations and bought on all my
favorite
shadows so I figured that since so many
of you own these colors I would show you
how to transition the colors that I
recommend it all throughout winter into
your summer looks so I just use a white
hair brush to go to hair brush that one
was by Sigma it's the same as the Mac
217 and I'm going to go back with that
same black hair blending brush and just
smooth over all of it so that there's no
harsh lines at all then I'm going to go
in with Mac wipes I do not like these
wipes I actually can't stand them but I
have them because you get them for free
when you become an employee with Mac and
I've had them forever so I just use that
to wipe off the fallout and then I'm
going to use my new Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation a great
foundation for this look would be the
new the newer mineralized foundation by
Mac it has a beautiful dewy finish
you're probably going to set it with
powder unless you're like extremely dry
and you want to really look dewy but
that would be a great alternative to
this um I don't have it in my shade
right now because I am very fair
extremely fair for this time of year
haven't seen the Sun in a while so I am
just using my flat top synthetic kabuki
brush this is the f80 by sigma and then
i'm going to use the benefit fake up
concealer this concealer has a
surrounding edge and layer like a
moisturizer and the concealer is in the
center it is a very sheer concealer it
is not going to give you full coverage
so even though it looks like I'm putting
on a lot when I blend this out not full
coverage whatsoever it's still going to
give me only about half of the power
that the Mac Pro Longwear does so this
is something that you're going to use
you know in the summertime something
like the look that I'm doing right now
where you don't want something full
coverage and to really do a lot of work
under the eyes but just to give you a
little help cover up the dark circles a
little bit you know I'm saying okay now
I'm going to use my Anastasia brow
pencil I am using it in the color soft
Brown I know a lot of you are asking
questions about what colors I'm using to
fill in my eyebrows now that my hair is
red and I'm not going to use a red or
Auburn color I'm still going to just
continue to use you know a warmer brown
tone and I use the opposite end of the
spoolie brush and I buff it out so
that's not too harsh I have been filling
in my brows a little bit
the normal recently and then I'm going
to use the Anastasia brow gel you guys
were right this stuff is amazing and
then I'm just gonna put those babies in
place I know they look really weird
because I barely have like any eye
makeup on but they'll look better
towards the end of the video once
everything else is done I promise but
people look so manly with just eyebrows
and like not other stuff on their face
right okay I'm going to use dazzle light
normally I use shroom to highlight but
I'm going to use dazzle light instead
because it has more of a yellow we tone
with a little bit of pink in it and I
like that for this bronze look that I'm
going for as opposed to shroom is just a
straight highlight so I like that this
has a little bit of warmth in it and I'm
going to pop that on my inner corner as
well just to brighten up that eye area
you can bring it down as far under that
eye as you feel necessary you can bring
it all the way in like half way through
the eye I'm just touching on the inner
corners and then I'm gonna take my josie
maran argan illuminizer
oh can you hear the Hallelujah courses
cuz I can hello so amazing I am obsessed
with this stuff it is so versatile okay
so I'm using the Mac 130 brush I do not
recommend to use this exact brush for
what I'm doing right now and I'll tell
you why it breaks up the foundation if
you can see it it kind of goes through
it down to the skin but that's really
easy to fix
I wouldn't use one as dense as this one
but I have been out of town and cleaning
like crazy and my brushes are so dirty
so I use what I had but that's not
typically the brush that I would use
with it I would use more like a 187 or a
longer hair brush now I'm going to use
the Milani baked blush in Luminoso I
believe it is love this color love was
so overwhelmed at the drugstore and I
think I picked a good one
I am I love this color it's just such
pretty peach color okay so I'm just
putting this on the apples of my cheeks
using a blush brush I like to use a
synthetic brush when applying my blush
oh that was hard and then I'm going to
use the betty loumanizer
this is a bronzer with shimmer so many
of you were asking how to wear this
because you were confused this is what I
do I just tap it twice and then I tap
off all the excess and then I start in
the inner part of the face and I fluff
it outward
do not bring it
- hi do not bring it too low keep it
right on the apples of the cheeks moving
upward and start and the inner part of
your face and not the outer otherwise
you'll have a muddy appearance so I like
to layer these types of bronzers with
blush it looks a lot more natural than
just to pack it on it'll be very Brown
so then I'm going to take the mac
mineralize skinfinish in medium dark i
believe this is which is just a little
bit darker than my skin tone and I'm
just going to bronze the forehead
because we have all that going on on the
cheeks you don't want to leave your
forehead out just with nothing but
foundation it's gonna look very washed
out so I'm just taking no additional
product on my brush and just going over
that just to smooth out that bronzer to
make sure there's no harsh lines so
nothing is jaggedy hello time to curl
the eyelashes any eyelash curler will do
just curl those babies up and then I'm
using the Maybelline fibre extensions
ilegal length mascara a lot of you guys
complained about my eyelashes in a photo
I posted on Instagram but I don't know
what to tell you the last month or two
my eyelashes have just been seeming very
thin and just spider-like and I'm not
joking when I tell you I probably own 20
mascaras all different types and this is
just what happens so God gave them to me
and I'm going to work it this is
Rimmel's lipstick and pink chick and as
you can see it's very pink so I'm going
to layer it I'm going to put this on and
then after I have that I'm going to go
in with another Rimmel lipstick in nude
delight I absolutely love both of these
colors and together I think it makes a
great nude pink color it's not too nude
though it's not a whiteout nude it's got
like a natural neutral pink tone so I
really enjoy those shades together then
I'm going to take dazzle light again and
pop it on my Cupid's bow and this will
just bring more of that glowy factor to
the face and make the lip color stand
out I'm going to take texture on a two
one two brush and just put it on the
outer corners of my eyes and then I'm
taking this pencil brush this is by
Sedona lace and I'm just going to blend
it out any pencil brush will do this is
the one I had handy and just work it out
so that it's not a harsh line just
smooth over it back and forth a bunch of
times and it'll just be buffed out
nothing precise like I said the eyes as
you can see our just blown out bronze
extremely simple and then I'm going to
mask
my bottom lashes as well with the exact
same mascara it's by Maybelline I know
they look like spiders I understand I
catch ya don't know what to do if you
guys have a great mascara that you think
makes your lashes thick and voluminous
let me know because for now this is what
I'm working with I'm going to use the
Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray
and drench myself in it so that I don't
move and I am ready for the day and
after that you are completely finished
so I hope you enjoy this really easy
bronze natural glowing look and I will
talk to you soon
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
