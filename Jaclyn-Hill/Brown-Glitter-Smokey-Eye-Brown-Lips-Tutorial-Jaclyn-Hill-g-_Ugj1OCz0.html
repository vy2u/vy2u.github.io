to be doing a makeup tutorial on this
look that just see right here all up on
my face I am really really excited to be
doing this look because I have been
wanting to do this look for about five
weeks now and I was debating it I should
do it or not coz I was like should I
just say screw it into a spring tutorial
and I was like nah
I gotta do it I've been thinking about
this look for way too long to not do it
I 5 weeks I've been what I've been
planning this look out honestly I've
talked to you guys about on snapchat I
had to get this out of my system guys
before jumping into a spring tutorial
because I'm very excited for spring and
summer trends not excited for spring and
summer because here in Florida it gets
so humid that joy brace yourselves
but spring and summer makeup trends mmm
very excited about I can't flip it oh
wait 1/2 Lipan no Wi-Fi that's such a
funny term oh yeah so for today's video
I'm doing a brown glittery smokey eye
and let me just tell you it has been a
journey finding a beautiful dark brown
glitter I have been online for about
four weeks ordering glitter from all
different companies and even companies
that sell like over a hundred different
glitters it's so hard to find like a
beautiful true dark brown glitter so for
today's video I use the prettiest dark
brown glitter that I could personally
find on my hunt for today's tutorial I
paired my smoky eye with a really
intense dark brown lip and I'll be
honest when the dark brown lip first
came to the scene and people were
wearing it I was like no thank you all
past that looks like doodoo all up on
your lips not for me within about three
weeks I was like yay lips I absolutely
love a dark brown lip now but it is not
for everybody so for those of you who
want to recreate this look don't think
that you need to put a bold lip you can
do a nude and neutral lip and you will
totally be good to go I was going to
call it the circle because it drives me
crazy it's a very long story but people
have asked questions about it and an
electrician came here and made this mark
on my wall he didn't have a pen with him
and he's like well I don't have a pen
all I have is eyeliner and he was a
battle work so with my eyeliner he was
like and I was like mmm
that's what that is but this is changing
very soon so it'll it'll be gone for
those of you who are like I get it I'm
like I'm like that too I'm nosy I'm one
of those girls let's just I get it I'm
gonna stop babbling now I swear to God I
say that in the beginning of every
single video don't I um but anyways keep
in mind that even though that this is a
really dark smoky look this can still be
more in the spring there are no rules
there's trends of course but if you want
to rock this and like at on a date night
and the spring girl do you I'll wear
these colors all spring long like of
course so that's the beauty of makeup
people set trends but you're a person
too so you can set a trend and I'm
saying terms are just set by people
we're people let's set our own trends
I'm going to be wearing this in the
spring and summer you do what you want
to do that's the beauty of makeup I love
you guys so much thanks for watching
this video and I will see you guys in my
next video
bye guys hello my friends thank you for
joining me here today first thing I'm
going to do is pick up my morphe 35o
palette and i'm going to grab this
really light orange ii kind of pale
peachy shade it's one of my favorites
and using the morphe m4 4-1 brush I'm
going to put this in my crease today I'm
going to try to keep the colors a little
bit lower on my eye because it's going
to be really bold and intense so I don't
want it to go overboard and go up too
high to the brow then I'm going to grab
the shade which is a little bit more
neutral but in the same tone as the
first shade that we went in with I'm
going to pack that literally right on
top the reason I will go in with two or
three shades on top of each other is
because it makes your job easier when
blending out shades when you only blend
out one color can make it kind of
difficult you can sit there for a while
it can be kind of choppy when you go in
with multiple shades over top of each
other just a little bit at a time it
blends out easier and it gives more
dimension to the eye now I'm going to go
in with this darker brown shade this is
one of my favorite colors in the palette
because it's such a beautiful brown it's
not cool whatsoever but it's not too
neutral and it's not too warm and it's
the perfect shade of brown it's not too
dark I absolutely love it so with that
color I'm going to do the exact same
thing as before and I'm going to pack
that right on in the crease keeping it
nice and low as you can see all the way
to the inner corner but I'm not going to
go up whatsoever on the bridge of the
nose I'm going to keep it nice and flat
on the inner
because I don't want this to be blown
out too dramatic today since it's going
to be such a dramatic intense dark I I
don't it's look like I've been hit
punched in the face is not a cute look
so now I'm going to pick up a Natasha de
Nona palette and I'm going to use the
shade 8 8 V so 88 V and now I'm using
the morphe m-43 3 brush this is my go-to
blending brush if you guys need one
blending eye brush this is the one I
would go with I can't live without this
brush as you can see this is a warm dark
brown if you don't want to spend the
money on etosha de Nona shades I would
suggest Mac Swiss chocolate it's
extremely similar to the shade you'll
get the same result pretty much I'm
going to pack that on the lid in the
exact same area the idea with the other
colors really making sure that it's
darkest in the crease of the eye and
then I'm going to go back in with my
original blending brush with no product
on it and just run over the edges to
make sure that it's all blended out but
as you can see I'm keeping it nice and
light and I'm sorry not light nice and
tight and low on the lid so it's not too
dramatic and over the top now I'm going
to pick up a Kat Von D this is like her
metal crush eyeshadows I believe they're
called in the shade synergy and then I'm
going to dampen my brush with mac fix+
and everyone always asks I put the
product on my brush first and then I
dampen it that's how I think I get the
best results and now I'm using a mac 242
brush which is one of my absolute
favorite go to all over lid brushes I
just think it's perfect it packs on
pigments glitters metallics everything
you can think of I just love this brush
so much and I'm going to pack that on
the entire lid from inner corner all
wood outer corner kind of as a base for
the glitter that we're going to go in
with but first I'm going to go in with a
gel liner and I'm going to be using
color pop call me which is a dark brown
kind of purple undertone in it it's
definitely a different color it's really
pretty and I'm going to be doing just
like a baby half winged today cuz I
didn't want to leave the outer corner of
my eye totally blank but I didn't want
to do something totally typical like
always and do an intense thick black
winged liner so I chose to do a dark
brown and I thought that this dark brown
was really pretty because it has some
purple notes in it so it didn't just
completely blend in with the rest of the
look 100% and I am doing like a baby
half winged as opposed to doing a thick
all over the lid
wing I wanted to keep it just the outer
corner that way the glitter can kind of
speak for itself and they're not both
fighting for who's boss and then I'm
going to go in with obsessive compulsive
cosmetics also known as OCC loose
glitter and the shade coffee I'm going
to be using Too Faced shadow insurance
glitter glue this glitter glue is hands
down the best glitter glue I've ever use
I've tried so many from so many
different cosmetic companies and this is
my absolute favorite so you put the
glitter glue all over your lid with the
brush and then while it's still tacky
you just go in and start packing on
glitter and as you can see this is loose
glitter and I am barely getting any
fallout whatsoever all my face if any
like it really is the best glitter glue
in the world I would never ever use
anything else honestly especially if
it's an occasion where you really don't
want your glitter to be messy and you
want it to stay nice and perfect to face
glitter glue is where it's at I'm
telling you it is the bomb
so using that same exact brush that I've
used for everything else on the lid I'm
just packing this glitter all over I
want to make sure not to cover up my eye
liner on the outer corner then I'm going
to grab some mac cosmetics reflex
antique gold I don't know why my face
gets so splotchy I don't know I'm so
sensitive you guys my face is such a
mess all the time and I'm just going to
pack a little bit of that just in the
center of the eye just for a little bit
more dimension you really don't even
notice that it's there it's just going
to kind of make the sin of your eye pop
a little bit more then I'm grabbing
blinking beaut lashes these are the
style that Samantha created Samantha's
here on YouTube her name is Samantha
with 3 s's and these lashes are
beautiful so I just popped some of those
on and then I'm going to prime my face I
am using the Becca backlighting filter
something this is the luminous primer
I'll link it down below I'm going to
prime my entire face with that and I'm
going to be going in with Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation one of my
favorite foundations of all time and I
am back to using a my morphe foundation
brush brush this is the m-43 9 brush I
was on the artiste brush kick for a
while which I still really love that
brush but I have been back to this one
the past couple of weeks I just love it
it's one of those brushes that it's just
it's always going to be there for you no
matter what
what you go through no matter how bad
times get that brush will always work I
love it now I'm going to put on some
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer and I'm
going to blend it out under my eye area
I am using the new Kat Von D and Beauty
Blender collaboration which is why the
Beauty Blender is black I think it's
super cool even though you can see every
little speck of concealer and dirt on it
it's cool to see a black Beauty Blender
and then I'm going to take that same
concealer and put it down the center of
my nose on my Cupid's bow and on my chin
and I'm going to kind of just blend it
out everywhere so that we have a nice
highlighted center of the face as well
because that under-eye area was looking
pretty white because my spray tan is
very very orange II dark right now so I
needed to kind of even out the face then
I'm going to grab a Nastasia banana
powder and normally I mix this with some
Mac emphasized but recently I have been
loving just using this all by itself I
feel like it makes my under eyes look
better I feel like it kind of hides any
crepey or dryness it really brightens
and it doesn't accentuate any like
unlike under eye lines or anything like
that I love it now I'm going to be going
in with Giorgio Armani powder I just
discover this like a week and a half ago
and oh my god why did I ever know about
this powder before it is such a
beautiful face powder so I'm gonna
lightly set my entire face with this
powder that way I can go in with bronzer
and everything will go on nice and
smooth
I'm going to grab this color again that
we use on the upper lid from the morphe
35o palette using any pencil brush I'm
going to begin just to put this on the
under eye area all the way from inner
corner to outer corner but when I say
inner corner I don't like to go too hard
on the inner tear-duct because then it
can start to look messy especially
throughout the day so I don't bring it
all the way in I kind of just go towards
the inner corner and then kind of stop
right at that tear duct if that makes
sense these shots are terrible when I
was editing this I was like I need to
lower my camera this is such a mess and
the facial expressions I make I just
can't so right now I'm going in with
that same Natasha Danone a shade and I'm
just buffing that out and then I'm going
to grab some black liner this is by
ardency in I've said a million times
this is the best black liner I've ever
used
my waterline it doesn't move it's so
creamy and easy to apply and then I'm
going to grab a little bit of a black
shadow on a definer brush and just stay
right on that lash line and just wiggle
back and forth so that it smokes out
look at my mouth though honestly I'm
like all up in your face pretty much out
of focus with my mouth hanging open like
could I really chocolate like get it
together haven't you been doing this for
like three years now four years come on
reevaluate your life I am putting
mascara on my lower lashes of course I'm
using L'Oreal what is this L'Oreal
carbon black voluminous mascara that's
what it is
and then for brows I am going to be
using the Anastasia brow definer oh you
guys are probably gonna get sick of me
talking about this freaking product but
honestly you guys it is so good like I
don't even care it's getting to that
point in our relationship I am loyal
you'll be getting our invitations very
soon the wedding is happening we are in
a committed relationship so let's just
move on I'm going to be bronzing my face
using Mac give me Sun I just recently
purchased this product again I was
shopping on like MAC Cosmetics calm and
I saw give me Sun and I'm like oh my
gosh why have I not used this if you
guys ever watched my very first videos
here on YouTube I went through probably
five of these like this was my favorite
bronzer of all time I've been using
again this week and I'm like why did I
ever stop using this bronzer it's so
beautiful and I am using the mac 135
brush to apply it and then I'm going to
do just a little bit of cooking and I'm
going to use some RCM a no color
transfer scent powder I'm gonna let this
sit here for just like two minutes while
I just run over my face with some other
products so that it's not as sloppy as I
just applied it I am putting some
Anastacio clear brow gel which is the
gorilla glue a brow gel honestly it's
the balm and I'm taking a little bit
more of that banana powder and just
putting it on the center of my face my
chin and just kind of running it over
like the t-zone area because I just felt
like I want it to be a little bit more
defined that way the bronzer didn't like
run over to the center of my face so I'm
going to go ahead and blend out that
bacod
if you will oh it's the best feeling
when you blend that out on your contour
like in your bronzer just nice and sharp
and clean like I swear I think that's my
favorite part of doing makeup now for
blush I'm going to go in with
- Macke blushes this whole pallet that
you see here is matte blushes I'm going
to grab modern Mandarin such a tongue
twister for me and copper tone and I'm
going to mix those two together and then
I'm going to put that on the apple of
the cheek going backward towards the
temple kind of blending in with the
bronzer I didn't want it to be too much
on the apples of my cheeks though
because then I can I had a sunburn so
I'm trying to kind of angle it to the
side and brush it back I'm going to use
the Charlotte Tilbury bar of gold to
highlight this is my first time using it
and I think it's really really beautiful
and for the brush i'm using the morphe
m31 o fan brush i mentioned this in my
favourites video i have been loving this
recently to highlight with i just think
that it makes it so easy and just
distributes it evenly across your face
so I've really been loving it
I'm going to take a little bit that same
highlight and put on my Cupid's bow and
then it's time to go in with our lip I'm
going to be using jeffree star
dominatrix which is a very very deep
dark brown it does have a red undertone
in it which I really really like because
there are a lot of different shades of
dark brown out there this one definitely
has a red undertone which I just think
is really pretty and complement to look
especially like this one not to mention
jeffree star liquid lips are one of the
best and my personal opinion I'm not a
liquid lip fan overall but I do like
Jeffries so yeah after you apply that
lip we are good to go so I hope you
enjoy this video you guys thank you so
much for watching I love you and I will
see you soon thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
