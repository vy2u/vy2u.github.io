gonna be on no I just got my hair
finished I know I feel like it's my
wedding I'm like I have my hair done
professionally for the first time I have
my bridesmaids here with me great sewing
person my mom is back there getting her
hair done Jackie and Micah how's it
going ladies
Jackie has been doing everybody's makeup
for the past how long two hours you've
been working on everybody you are
literally an angel Jackie the fact that
you like
by how many lashes a la velocities so
sweet so I am so excited I can barely
take it I have been very anxious today I
accidentally drank espresso
I didn't know it was a decaf and had a
had a bad moment but that's ok highlight
is pretty sleek it's very pretty
oh it's leaking runny I'm ready let's go
thank you so much for joining us tonight
my name is Bob Baker I am the CEO of
celebrating everything that we've done
together with Jacqueline on champagne
pop I might be the CEO of Becca but
Jacqueline says that I'm actually our
custom attics dad's blue we all love
Jacqueline and I think it's great that
you guys are here to celebrate this with
us you know we love Jacqueline and Becca
because I think what Jacqueline embodies
is something all of us appreciate why
all of you are here tonight or all of
her followers are so engaged is that
there's a certain authenticity there's a
certain realness and what Jacqueline's
talking yeah about everything is yes and
with projec was Tommy and it's such a
refreshing thing for all of us to
remember is that beauty's not the
products we sell these not something
that a company or a cosmetics brand
could say to you that you looks like
this may be something that's inside
Jacqueline's taught us all to believe to
love and the purpose the beauty that's
inside of us and side of other people
and I think this room represents that
and it's not defined by a single product
and champagne pop is the celebration of
embracing the beauties into us and it's
a month for me and for the team at Becca
I would say that something that we love
about working with Jacqueline and way
we're so proud to have Becca extract we
go and party champagne pop so grab glass
let's say
honestly I know that this down slope
should be cheesy and I don't care
champagne pop has always represented
more than a highlighter our makeup
products mean it truly is I said this
round is happening I think it's on
YouTube on snapchat when you look at ice
I wouldn't know that dreams come true I
don't catch easy as a little girl I
would watch Britney Spears on a stage
play dreams come true dreams come true
without being like oh my god please Lord
let that be the truth because one day I
want to be doing something like that
would I want to be in front of the one
day I want to inspire people
I wouldn't go filiberty makes me feel
and you know John I have been through so
so much struggle one day I hope to write
a book because I don't have the
confidence to reveal all the secrets I
get but let me just say that the fact
that I had a company like that go sorry
people behind it so much morale so much
heart come to me give me a chance like
little old me who couldn't pay bills and
used to sit in the dark me like candles
with this guy and the fact that I can
actually see my face in them the place
that I shopped out for years at that
place I used to go to my lunch break and
couldn't afford supporting security
samples they knew
poor things and the fact that I see my
mates there honestly even if someone
can't afford it even if you don't own it
I just hope you know that from the
bottom of my heart champagne pump really
stands for the fact that dreams do come
true that's what it is all about at the
end of the day it's more than just
makeup that's my mom and I slogan it is
more than just makeup and I just hope
that you think of that every time you
open champion pop and I'm so damn
grateful if that don't believe in you
help expand the champagne pop Ali it
gives me another chance
even after me saying no to them a
million times on everything I know I
can't sometimes enough being a person
over quick I'm definitely nowhere I'm
not thankful for this this expansion on
the collaboration so I'm saying you so
much to anyone who got on a plane and
