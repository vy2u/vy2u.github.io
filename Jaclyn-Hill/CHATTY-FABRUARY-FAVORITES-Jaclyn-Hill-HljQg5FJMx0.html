favorites I'm so excited to sit down and
sum this video need take a deep breath I
get too excited I get carried away and
then when I'm editing I'm like bitch you
need to calm down I feel like I haven't
sat down on camera and talk to you guys
in like 16 years because the last couple
videos like my last video was with my
friend and then it was makeup tutorials
I said I haven't sat down and chill
chill with you guys so I'm very excited
to be coming today's video so anyways
first thing is first I did chop off life
and if you follow me on snapchat and
Instagram and this is completely until
we all knows about all news to you but I
just have to say I have truly never been
this happy with my hair I don't even
know I've ever been this happy with my
hair in my whole life but I am so in
love with this haircut I cannot even
begin to tell you guys I am NOT going to
encourage you to cut your hair I'm not
doing that because it is a very personal
thing because if you have long luscious
hair and you all of a sudden just wake
up one day and go I'm gonna talk about
my hair you're probably gonna bawl your
eyes out and hate it but this has been a
very very very long time coming if you
guys remember some of you I'm sure I
used to have hair like really really a
lot longer than I didn't realize at the
time but like all the way down like at
the bottom of my rib cage and I chopped
it off because I just had so much damage
and breakage and split ends and I have
like breaking all over my hair and it
was uneven it was lopsided it was just a
mess so I chopped it off it's like a
long bob and it was asymmetrical but
it's at like here in the front and like
kind of here in the back it was
definitely a drastic change but nowhere
near as drastic is this but even after
that I loved it but I still had raikage
I still had dead hair in here I still
have like uneven pieces and layers and
basically like my haircut as it last
week was just my grown out messy
straggly long bob it's just not cute and
I just hated my hair for months I've
hated it I mean like I'm mad I've been
unhappy my hair for a long time but for
the past
like I truly hated it like every time I
style it I'll spend 40 minutes making my
hair look perfect and within 20 minutes
I'm like I hate this and I put it in a
bun or I put it in a ponytail
I'm just very unhappy with it it's just
a personal thing um so I start
researching hair dress there's a couple
months ago I was researching them in LA
I was looking for them in Chicago I was
willing to travel I was like I just want
to find someone who really knows what
they're doing who's gonna give me like
the cut that I need you know so my mom
referred me to someone who used to cut
her hair and is like an educator here in
Tampa and so I went to her and I didn't
know what I was gonna do really I was
like I feel like I have to chop it off
in order to make it healthy and now I
came and put it in a bun and so we're
like I can't put it in a bun anymore I
have no excuse I have to actually style
it which is fine because it takes like
15 minutes to style like tops and when I
washed it yesterday I was like where's
my air but it dries so fast like I'm not
kidding I blew dry my hair for like
maybe five minutes and was completely
dry I was like okay get used to this so
yeah it just feels good to have healthy
hair and not have dead ends weighing me
down and a lot of you guys are probably
fast boarding right now cuz we don't
care but I have had so many questions
and comments on all social media about
my hair the past couple of days so I
will go into more detail later I know a
ton of you guys are asking for like a
how I style my short hair video already
give me a minute and I will get around
to doing that and like the next month
just let me kind of get used to how I
want to Salix I'm still kind of playing
with it because it's literally been 72
hours so we'll get there enough about me
and my hair let's jump into my favorites
the first thing I want to talk about is
something that I actually haven't even
technically used yet but I just have to
mention it because it's so freaking cute
this is a Z palette I ordered this
online and I purchased two of them when
I saw them because I was like this is so
cute I need to I don't know why but I
just do theirs is like the cutest Z
palette I've ever seen I mean you sit
down and take the time to figure out
like what I want to put in this like
what shadows or blood cells or maybe
contour colors I need to figure it out
but it sounds so stupid but I'm like I
want to be really picky I don't want to
just put anything in here whatever I put
in here needs to be like freaking bomb
because this palettes so cute so I just
love it I don't know if it's limited
edition or permanent
I know Z palettes things can kind of
come and go really quickly and I
just get it on zip alikom so you can
find it there so my next favorite is a
highlight and this is all because of
Kathleen lights I must say you guys I'm
really really really bad at watching
YouTube videos like even my friends on
YouTube I suck at watching their videos
I just anytime I have downtime I usually
spend it like with John or my family or
just like chillin and watching a movie
like I just don't watch YouTube videos
as much as I used to
um but when I get the opportunity to
just like lay down in bed with like a
cup of tea let's get real glass of wine
and I just lay there and zone out and
watch youtube videos for two hours it's
so much fun like I love watching YouTube
videos and I'm sorry anyways so I have
one of those nights where I was just
watching videos I was discovering new
people I was subscribing to random
people just like yeah this is amazing
and I was on the computer on YouTube for
two and a half hours and I got sucked
into Kathleen's Channel was watching ten
videos and I watched her January
favorites and this was like three weeks
ago two weeks ago maybe two weeks ago
and I immediately got online and started
searching for this product cuz she was
raving about it oh my god it was sold
out everywhere so I bought on amazon.com
for three times the price which is
ridiculous and of course it's now back
in stock on Ulta and I was like really
I bought it when it was out of stock
everywhere but now it's back so anyways
it is absolutely beautiful on my
preacher cathing lights the same thing
and that it really reminds me of math
whisper of guilt it has like that it's
kind of got laura geller gilded honey it
has like that
um extreme dimension skin finished by
Mac texture like where it's not powdery
but it's not too oily it's just like
that really intense Sheen I love this
consistency for highlights I think it's
absolutely beautiful so I've been loving
loving this color actually have this
mixed with champagne pop on my cheeks
right now and then this right next to it
is a really really beautiful coral blush
it's not too intense it's very very
natural it's really really beautiful I
don't know why I've been showing so much
boob recently this has not been
intentional I actually hate it like it's
because I've gained weight I was being
honest and I used to be much smaller
chested and like I could wear stuff like
this and have absolutely no cleavage at
all because I just like basically have
no boo
but now like that I've gained a little
bit of weight I just keep forgetting
that my boobs got bigger okay so two
glosses that I have been in Hoonah for
both by buxom and I have been using this
formula for probably what three years at
this point right only only two or three
shades and this is the buxom full-on lip
cream if you guys have been watching my
channel for a while you know how much I
love White Russian I discovered White
Russian I think it's been three years
and I have gone through so many twos I
love it so much what makes them so
beautiful is they're just the right
amount of pigment they're not too thick
to the point that they kind of break up
and like leave that white line on your
lips and they're not too sheer where
they don't deposit any color like
they're just the right amount of color
payoff and they're so glossy they look
really wet on the lips they're just like
a beautiful classic gloss they do have a
really really intense minty sensation so
they make your lips very cold and it's
like you have fresh breath all day long
because it's like you have a mint
sitting on your lips I know that's
random so I got on to Sephora calm about
two and a half weeks ago or so and I
purchased a big order I purchased a big
order
I made a big order I made a big purchase
um and I ordered a ton of the shades
from the full-on lip cream line so I'm
like why is this one of my favorite
formulas we get I only own like two or
three shades so that's gonna add up so I
ordered a bunch of new shades and I'm in
love with the both of these and I can
tell you that it's one of those things
where I've only worn both of them like
twice but I can tell you right now these
are going to be my favorite go-to
glosses for all spring and summer
because of the shade these tubes are
going to be empty by July so the first
one is the shade creamsicle and it looks
like that right there it's a really
really pretty pink it's like a baby pink
with a little bit of peach in it it's so
pretty and it's just the right amount of
pigment I love it so much and then this
one is my tie I'm like get the mind's
eye and it's a gorgeous gorgeous coral
it looks more berry on camera I'm seeing
right there um in person it's a straight
coral like a coral orange almost and
what I
about these shades is if you're someone
who you want to do a colorful like coral
or pink lip in the summertime but you're
not feeling bold enough to do it a color
like this I can intense matte or vibrant
you can do something like this where you
have a glocks wears it a sheer color and
it'll still look so beautiful and really
complement your skin tone and
complements your eyes without being like
BAM in your face if you're not like a
bold lip kind of girl you know what I'm
saying so one of my favorite all-time
formulas and these shades I'm just in
love with okay so I have gotten a
million questions the past couple of
days about what lip color I have been
wearing on snapchat
ever since I caught my hair I've been
wearing the exact same lip color for the
past three days straight don't ask I
just feel like my hair is so different
and like I um I just haven't gotten used
to it yet it's just so different that I
feel like I need like a sassy lip color
I feel like my hair listen guys this is
just the way I feel alright I feel like
I can't just do like a basic nude I'm
like no this haircut it means like a
sassy lip color so the past couple of
days I have been wearing these two
shades mixed together non-stop so I've
warmed the past 72 hours and I have been
loved being them and it's really really
weird for me because I am NOT a liquid
lipstick person like I said this a
million times even though I wear them
and even though I'll even mention in my
favorites like it has to be a liquid
lipstick that is like incredible like
mind-blowing or for me to like it
because I just don't like liquid lips I
prefer glosses and I prefer regular
lipsticks way more than a liquid lips so
for me to say that I like a liquid lip
it's kind of a big deal
and I've noticed that Oprah cosmetics
has quickly become one of my favorite
formulas mmm choking on my own saliva
I'm gonna be okay so the two shades I
have been mixing together to get the
color that I'm wearing on my lips right
now are Atlantic City and
Venice is really Orange and Atlantic
City is kind of like a true red so
Atlantic City looks like this by itself
right there as you can see it's like a
true blue kind of like All American red
and then Venice is really Orange love I
love it so what i do is i line my lips
with Atlantic City so I have a true red
on underneath and then I will put
there's like a bug flying around here
can you leave me be and then I will take
Venice and put that over top of it that
way it's like a mixture of red and
orange oh it's not too bad not too
orange I'm picky I'm high-maintenance
when it comes to makeup this is how it
works
so Atlantic City and Venice I don't know
where I mentioned something about this
brush I don't pose in a video or if it
was on snapchat I mentioned that I had
been using a brush recently from morphe
kind of in replacement of the Mac 242
and I was getting so many questions
about which one it was
I don't remember if it was a video or
snapchat whatever anyways this is the
morphe and 5 to 2 brush and I have been
using this to apply my all-over lid
color I would compare this to like a
sigma e55 which i loved for like years
and the mac 242 which i've loved for
years this is kind of in a similar
ballpark but yet all three of them are
totally different but it's just a great
brush to apply your all-over lid color
which I don't have any on today I only
have a crease color but still it's just
a really nice brush just to apply the
Oliver lid and again morphe m-52 - I
just made all of my brushes last night
it was such a bitch but I did it if you
guys have been here my channel for a
while you have seen me tougher this
foundation literally probably I'd use
this foundation in 150 videos but I have
not used it in a long time and I just
fell back in love with it again this
month and this is the Giorgio Armani a
luminous silk foundation I don't know
why I haven't used this because there's
so many new foundations that constantly
come out I'm constantly trying new
things and getting distracted
this is just one of those foundations
it's just like it's never going to stop
being my favorite I would say right now
my favorite foundations ever just top -
of all time would be this and then make
it forever
Ultra HD foundation stick now there are
other ones that
I love I love the bourgeois foundation I
love LC Foundation but I would say these
two are like at this exact moment this
month those two are like my ride-or-die
so this is what I'm wearing today if
you're new here in my channel you hadn't
heard me rave about this before I'm
telling you for dry to normal comp dry
to normal skin it is just so beautiful
it's so lightweight it's not too watery
but it's not thick or creamy whatsoever
it just goes on and looks like skin it's
so moisturizing it just feels so
hydrating throughout the day it doesn't
settle in all my little lines I just
love this foundation so freaking much
like I've just fallen in love with it
again this month and I'm like why have I
been using this for the past six months
like tell me tell me why so Giorgio
Armani luminous silk I'm currently the
shade 5.75 in case you cared last but
not least I want to mention my shampoo
and conditioner that I have been using
for like a year and a half probably
maybe two years or more anyways my
hairdresser recommended this to me and
it's specifically for red hair and I get
questions about like how I keep up my
red hair and honestly I don't do
anything in particular to keep my hair
red I get it done religiously like every
five weeks because my growth when my
growth comes in it looks like my hair so
naturally ashy that it looks like it's
like gray and like sandy when it comes
in and this is not cute so my hair
really doesn't fade that much and it's
because of the shampoo and conditioner
my hair used to fade way more than it
does now but the shampoo and conditioner
really has saved it and this is by daven
s that's how my hairdresser pronounces
it I think it looks like it's Davines
Divine's but he says davon s and I had
the shampoo and the conditioner and
these are specifically for red hair so
this line has all different like all
different shampoos and conditioners but
this is the one specifically for red and
the actual shampoo these are both
completely empty right now but the
actual shampoo is like literally it
looks like blood when you pour it out it
is so red it looks like you're bleeding
to death and then
mission or you can see right here in the
cap again is red so I don't know
anything about hair honestly you guys my
talk about hair I just feel like I'm so
stupid I'm not educated in it whatsoever
I've never had a natural talent for hair
I'm not someone that can do badass
braids and then amazing curls like
that's not me I just it sucks because I
love makeup but I've just never had that
natural knack for hair um so anything I
ever tell you guys about hair and stuff
that I've been told it stuff like my
hairdresser has told me and educated me
on um but he's mentioned that like these
shampoo conditioners have hair color in
them and that's why my hair doesn't fade
as quickly as it used to every single
time I shower
I like redeposits that color in my hair
and it really does look like I'm
bleeding to death when I shower because
my hair does run so much especially the
first two times I shower after I hair
dye my hair oh my god like my bathtub
looks like this it is insane that cause
it comes out of my hair it looks like
someone just got done like a slasher
movie was filmed in there but anyways so
I just really really love these I will
say that this conditioner will stain
your hands if you leave it on your hands
for even ten seconds your hand will be
stained for several hours so I always
like scoop it out very quickly and put
it in my hair and try to not get all
over my hands because it'll stain my
nails everything but I definitely think
it's the secret that's helped me keep my
hair vibrant and the red not fading so
quickly because my hair used to fade
very quickly and kind of turn it's like
a kool-aid type of shade like a orangie
clay tea you get it like a pale nasty
color but this keeps it nice and rich so
yeah I order mine on Amazon and buy the
bulk I'll find it I'll link it down
below for you guys for those redheads
out there that are curious about shampoo
conditioner okay that's it that
completes this video I feel like that
went really fast even though it was
probably like you know you know the
drill is probably 45 minutes long but
yeah that's it I hope that you guys
enjoy this video leave any requests for
anything that you guys want to see down
below I know there's a huge requests
right now for me to do a story time
video about um how John and I met and
like my old relationship that lasted for
three years and like the dysfunction
that went on
and all that jazz so I will totally do
that for you guys but just let me know
anything else that you guys want to see
I have some awesome spring makeup
tutorials in mind that I can't wait to
do but I just feel like it's a little
too soon it's like in a couple of weeks
it'll be better timing so yeah okay
that's it I love you guys so much thanks
for watching and I'll see you soon
mmm bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
