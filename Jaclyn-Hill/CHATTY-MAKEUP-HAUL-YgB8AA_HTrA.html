background to my makeup room I guess I
feel like now you can kind of put the
pieces together of what this room looks
like now do you seem like the wallpaper
wall the desk and this is where I store
my makeup and I have to say right now
excuse my tan my sunless tanner is
coming off and I've been trying to
exfoliate and scrape it off but right
now it just looks terrible and so if I
look patchy at all in the camera or my
hands I'll match my face I apologize
this is just the way it is so today's
video is going to be a makeup haul and
this is kind of like a collective haul I
feel like no one ever does collective
hauls any more like several years ago
when I started YouTube it was all about
like collective hauls I miss the good
old days of YouTube remember when people
used to do swaps I'm sorry I'm being
rude let me turn my phone off wait it's
my sister sorry
family comes first anyways so I'm going
to be doing a haul today and this is a
haul of a lot of makeup that I have
accumulated over like the past month I
would say and I've kind of just had it
in all of these bags at my house and at
my office just kind of waiting to do
this for you guys now I have three bags
of makeup sitting here in front of me
and I'm like oh my god I have a problem
but it isn't spoke we are going to just
talk about all the makeup that I ever
just recently purchased um a lot of this
stuff was purchased in LA some of these
things were gotten at Nordstrom
sephora.com all over the place I'll let
you know also there is a few stuff that
some company some brands have sent to me
so I thought maybe I would go through
that we'll see if we have time um but
yeah I'll let you know what I purchased
on my own and if I show you guys like
anything that brands and Tennille let
you know they gave it to me even though
I feel like a lot of times people will
say stuff to me like oh you're only
talking about that because a brand sent
it to you and I really have never
understood that comment before because
honest to god anytime a brand sends
anything they know that if you don't
like it you're not going to be talking
about it anytime you ever see me talking
about anything
I'm not like open showing you this
because Marc Jacob sent it to me I'm
saying okay so let's talk about the
thing that I was most excited for and
this is literally what I went to IMAX
for there wasn't that many people there
excited like soon as the doors open on
pro day um but still there were a lot of
my subscribers there and we were talking
and hanging out taking pictures and they
did not like that like even though they
gave me permission and it was okay to be
there I had security following us around
like a hawk and it was very
uncomfortable and it does not matter
what my opinion is on this I had a lot
of people ask me it does not matter what
matters is that that's I Max's business
that's their place not mine they don't
want me there then I and then I need to
leave you know what I'm saying
and I just felt very uncomfortable
making them uncomfortable but I wanna
say thank you so much to all the
subscribers that I met because you guys
were so cool about it like you guys were
so understanding and so many of you like
didn't even take a picture with me you
just wanted to hug me and it was just so
nice like just having so many of you be
so respectful and understanding even
though I know that what she wanted was
to take pictures and hang out it was
just super cool of you so thank you so
much for not making that like any more
uncomfortable or like pissing IMATS off
anymore I'm saying so anyways the reason
I went to IMAX was for these new dose of
color glitter pigments I'm calling
glitter pigments but what they actually
are called are the ideal duo loose
pigments and primer but this is what I
actually went there for and it's funny
because I was so excited I had seen
these on Instagram for like a week
before I mask and I was like my heart
can't take it like I'm so in love with
anything glittery shimmery sparkly like
half - so I legit made a trip to IMAX
when the doors opened on pro day for
these and I walk up to the booth and Ana
was standing there makeup by Ana she's
on Instagram she's the owner dose of
colors and she's like hey girl your PR
package was just sent out yesterday so
all of the pigments are waiting for you
at your house and I was like I was in LA
and she sent them to my home which was
in Tampa when I got home like the first
thing I did was look for the dose of
colors lock smells like like rip to open
Legos Christmas so I did get all the
colors I was gonna
I each color like swear to God I was
going to buy every single color but
because she sent them to me I'm like
okay it would be wasteful of me to buy
them I'm gonna leave more product for
the people here at the show I didn't
want them to sell out um should I swatch
them all for you guys right now what do
you think should i swatched I think I
should swatch I think it should not be a
lazy bitch and I should just watch for
you give me a second this is gonna take
like 20 minutes I'll be back okay I so
watch them I said it before and I'll say
it again if I were to ever get a tattoo
I'm not kidding
it would be this I would get a tattoo of
makeup swatches that's what I would get
jhanas asking a million times what would
you get if you had to get like one
bullet tattoo and I'm like an arm full
of makeup swatches because that is my
that is everything right there
hmm I love it yes and I love that flag
get a girl get it so I'll just show you
the product really quick it looks like
this and like a little pot supercool
every single one of them has a primer
that is the same color of the pigment on
top so you have the primer on top with a
little tiny mini mirror and then you
open it up and then you have the pigment
down here all the pigments are very very
shimmery sparkly sparkly sparkly /
glittery when you apply them you do want
to apply them like going like this like
you was an eyeshadow not padding when
you apply a glitter you like to pat pat
pat with these you do want to go like
this and sweep it across the lid and
you'll get the most color payoff and
that's when they are there creamiest and
they apply the best I've only actually
worn one I wore maple on my eyes a
couple days ago and that's right I
notice not applying it so I want to give
you guys that tip so I'm going to zoom
into my arm now and I was going to tell
you the names of the shades on my arms
that you can see them for yourself okay
so starting from this side we have
stellar envy mermaid maroon maple um
where am i sticks and stones
sunset lucky star Lemon Drop pixie dust
disco shell and frozen they're so
beautiful so my favorite one is shale
and disco those are my two favorites as
far as like neutrals go right here oh
they're so cool and then my favorite
bold color is this one right here which
is envy I think this is such a
shade right there so next time dose of
color I got their three new liquid
lipsticks and they are such beautiful
shades especially this time of year this
one right on top is chocolate wasted
which I love love they named it
chocolate wasted because have you guys
ever seen the movie grown ups with Salma
Hayek and Adam Sandler first of all
items dealer can do no wrong in my eyes
no wrong that movie grown-ups is
actually like my favorite comedy of all
time I feel like that movie is exactly
how me and my friends are but we're
women and they're men but I've seen that
movie like 150 times never gets old I
love it so much anyway in that movie the
little girl goes I want to get chocolate
wasted so I think it's so cute they
named this chocolate wasted very similar
to like a Kylie Jenner true brown it's a
really really cool shade the second one
right there is cork which is like a warm
kind of orange caramel Brown is like a
medium brownish really pretty and the
last one is desert suede which is
beautiful it's like that gorgeous kind
of purple knobby plummy that shade that
we've been seeing now over the past year
and everyone is creating like different
versions and super gorgeous so these
three are just beautiful beautiful
liquid lipstick shades so while I was at
IMAX I picked up a couple of things from
etosha de Nonna and Frankie was
apparently really excited to try the
gloss because he's definitely got into
it the second I got home I got a couple
of front lip glosses but they're called
lip glaze so it's a Natasha de Nona lip
glaze and I think these are such a
they're just different they're so
different they're not like any other lip
products really they're very thick and
they're very creamy when they apply the
shade right here is number 16 wooden
rose and it comes out I'll show you it
just comes out super duper thick like
that so when it applies to the lips it
doesn't feel like a lipstick or lip
gloss it's like almost like a thick
butter in a sense and I feel like a lot
of people wouldn't like this but I love
it like I love it when things are super
glossy and like wet and intense and
pigmented on my lips I know that's weird
that's me so I really like these I have
one of hers it's over there on my desk
and I've used it several times which is
why I wanted to get a couple other
shades and I also got 0 for antique nude
in this one
like a really nice pink shade right
there and they smell like candy they
kind of smell like sweet tarts and I
also picked up the natasha denote a face
glow foundation this has SPF 15 and I
got two shades of this and the other
shade is actually at my house right now
because I used it twice so far um this
is shade 40 and then I also got shade 30
I believe and right now I am shade 30
because I'm definitely on the pale side
um but yeah so far I really like the
foundation it's very glowy it's very
dewy it's a sheer to medium coverage
the only thing is I will say that this
pump like this applicator I'm not a fan
of like it constantly pops out like this
like I don't know why um because it's
such like a short little like stub and
it doesn't go long down to the tube like
you have to like have it like this in
order for it to come out like it's just
kind of awkward and I'm saying I'm not a
fan of the packaging just being honest
but the product itself is very good so
far I only use a foundation twice but I
liked it so while I was in LA I actually
went to Namie's Beauty Supply and his
goal or the Disney's no I'm being
Nigel's Beauty Supply I went ten-day me
for the first time ever it's been a
dream of mine to go there for so long
and so many my friends have told me for
years it's like the most amazing beauty
supply store in the world they have
everything so I was like beyond excited
to get to go I woke up like today but I
was really overwhelmed and anxious in
there and I think it's cuz it was so hot
in there there AC might have been broken
it was a really hot day in LA I'm not
sure but I just felt like I gotta get
out of here um it was kind of weird but
anyway so while I was there I did get
the are C and a no color powder and I
got this 100% because of kathleenlights
she made an entire video about this
powder and I didn't get to watch the
entire video because I was in LA and I
was traveling till just like watching in
the car in between doing stuff um but
said she was raving about it I was
excited more girl I'm buying it like it
doesn't take much to convince me I know
it's sold out with a lot of places cuz
Kathleen but it'll come back in stock so
yeah
and then I've got Beauty Blender while I
was there nothing fun but it's my first
purple Beauty Blender so like this is a
moment I've never gotten any other color
than pink before random I know
and I got some map stuff and I got the
map mineralized skinfinish in the shade
medium which is the powder that I've
been using for the past month or two but
I just don't have the updated upgraded
packaging I'm using like the old school
map packaging for my back in the day and
I'm like it's time to get the new nice
packaging because sometimes when I pull
it up people are like wait what is that
because people are used to the new
packaging now which is much better about
the new matchmaster foundation and the
match master concealer so the original
match master I wasn't really a fan of
but I'm always willing to try any
foundations and it's weird to me because
I feel like I'm always going to be a Mac
girl at heart maybe it has me to do with
working there for four years but I just
feel like I always I always go back to
that I'm always going to try their new
stuff and I really never been into their
foundation but I'm always excited and
this is the new match master compact
okay why is this so dark are you kidding
me my friend told me this was going to
be my color good
maybe if I want the Bahamas for I don't
know two years that would be my color
okay so we will um we will get a new
shape but the concealer is in the shade
1.5 and I'm really excited to try this
because there's quite a few concealers
for Mac that I do really like so let me
see
ooh that could be anybody creamy okay
that could be a cakey mess work to be
perfection we will find out okay so then
it has my sister's name on it my
sister-in-law Adina because I would keep
you all her Christmas presents in this
bag in the closet so that's why her name
is on it let me just grab a few things
out of here okay so then I went online
shopping sf4 calm a couple weeks ago
maybe like two weeks ago and I got a few
of the new products and the first one I
got is the new East Saint Laurent - chic
la late inked radiance awakening
foundation this has a SPF of 22 in it
and it says it's weightless luminosity
and flawless coverage so I am a huge fan
of the original like to chic law
foundation I feel so like bougie would I
say that
- chikka like oh my god girl gets her um
anyways so I got the new foundation in
the shade B 30 because B 30 to be 40 is
usually my Shea
depending on pale or if I'm tan you get
the drill so I'm super super excited to
try this because I love the original I
love the way it smells so excited trust
you guys I really hope that it's what
I'm imagining in my mind because if it's
like the original tushy claw with just a
little bit more radiance oh I'm gonna
die for it so I'm really excited to try
that I got a lot of foundation I feel
like foundation is the one thing I am
never going to the foundation is one of
those products and I'm always looking
for a better foundations I'm always
looking to improve the look of my skin
you know I'm saying so whenever a new
foundation comes out I am on it so this
is the new Kevin Kwan it's called the
sensual skin fluid foundation and I love
Kevin upon products I love Kevin a Quan
a great brand great man great artist so
I'm really excited about this and the
packaging is super high-quality you push
it like this and then you screw it open
and then it's got like a little droplet
like that I love that okay let's see
this is going to be oh this looks like
it's going to be a perfect match okay it
feels nice and thin moisturizing it
feels creamy okay I'm excited I got mine
in the shade s f06
so I'm super excited to try this next I
got another foundation you guys it's the
month of foundations and this is the
Stila aqua glow serum foundation and the
reason I got this is because I was so
excited to get a serum foundations
I love serum foundations but a lot of
them really irritate my skin I have to
say the bare minerals foundation like
the serum one I know what it's called
cathing a bare minerals bare skin I have
to say that that's probably my favorite
foundation I've ever used in my entire
life but my skin hates it like if I use
it one time I get so many bumps my skin
gets red and irritated it sucks but that
foundation if I did not have at a
reaction to it I would wear that
constantly it's so easy to apply it so
beautiful
I just love serum foundations so this is
this like I said the Stila aqua glow
serum foundation okay how does this work
oh it's like the same
okay so pops up okay so it's like the
same as it Kevin a Quan so you push it
down oh my gosh I'm so excited okay so
this is definitely a lid
a bit too dark for me right now is his
light medium but if I had a spray tan
I'm telling me this looks really
beautiful very very sheer very hydrating
like a serum so yeah I'm excited try
that and then I also got hand in hand
the Stila
aqua glow serum concealer as well so
I've never tried a serum concealer um
but I'm excited to so I assume it's
going to be on the shear side since it's
a serum oh look it legit looks like a
serum okay
let me see this is so cool I don't know
why I feel like a pharmacist right now
ah that is so cool okay see okay so yes
it's very like watery it feels really
nice though it feels like up concealer
that will not crease like it feels
really good very thin lightweight this
feels nice for like days where you're
not looking for like an insane amount of
coverage so I got mine in the shade
light okay do not laugh at me I got one
more foundation this is by Laura Mercier
and this is the candle glow soft
luminous foundation
it says ambience oh I can't read that
just kidding that's a different language
okay this I got in the shade chive let's
see oh the packaging has like a tiger
print on the inside that's cool whoo
nice I like the bottle this is really
nice I'm like really into packaging
right now so don't mind me I'm
constantly commenting on the packaging
okay so let's see how this comes out
because this is supposed to be a soft
luminous foundation okay put a lot on my
arm honey I put a little too much and
that is definitely not my shade okay but
the foundation itself feels gorgeous it
feels like a medium to full coverage
super creamy very hydrating and as I'm
blending it out it's actually getting
lighter see that I'm blending out the
top and it's getting lighter than the
bottom that feels really nice and I
really love the smell I'm weird I know
then I got the Sephora concealers of the
Sephora brand concealer this is the
bright future gel serum so I actually
got this originally months ago when it
first came out where are you honey
I can't find it I might be able to
Jackie to put on her kid but I
originally got this on when it first
came out months ago but I got it in like
the lightest shade I think and it was
like white like it was snow white it
would have never worked on me so I just
bought another one that would actually
the color would actually work on my
skintone and this is in the shade 0-5
parfait I'm excited to try I haven't
heard anything about it whatsoever but
I've seen good ratings on it on Sephora
so yeah I'm gonna try that okay so then
these I did not purchase on my own I'll
makeup geek sent these to me but I said
I would show them because I have not
tried them yet and I'm so excited to try
them and these are the new contour
powders and she came out with one two
three four five six seven eight shades
waiting my line yes eight there's one in
the bag she came out with eight
different shapes she came out with light
medium warm cool when I laid them out it
looks like it is a really really really
great variety of color she has shape in
there that are gonna work on the
lightest skin tones and she has shades
in there that are gonna work on the
absolute darkest skin tones I think he's
in a Z palette don't I yes I do hold on
okay so I just popped all of the makeup
geek contour powders in a Z palette and
this is the range right here as you can
see eight shades with a really really
great range from warm to cool light
medium dark it's awesome so the color
that I would initially go in for myself
is this one right here which is in the
shade bad habits and you guys just
initially touching them like they're so
creamy I'm trying like find a place to
swatch but like are you kidding look at
that so high pigmented and so creamy
which is so beyond necessary when you're
doing a contour powder if any of you
have had the experience of working with
like a dry contour powder and you go to
put it on and it gets like patchy and
when you blend it out and you're wait a
second why is it darker here and lighter
here and it's just it can be so messy so
quickly so when someone makes a creamy
powder like this it's like the Kat Von D
a little of her powders because they're
so creamy and it's so nice to have that
because it's so much easier to blend and
get a nice smooth shadow under the
cheekbone so I'm so excited to try
I love seeing makeup geek doing more
stuff and branching out making their
brand bigger it's awesome are you guys
so that completes this haul I know it
was a little random and all over the
place but let's be honest that's like
the perfect description for my life so
it's kind of what you get here at my
channel so I hope that you guys enjoy
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys and I'll see you soon mmm bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
