channel for today's video I'm going to
be doing a chit chat get ready with me
I'm actually running out the door I
should have left about two minutes ago
and as I was running out to my car I was
like oh I forgot to film an intro so I
turned around and came back in and asked
I'm doing so that's why I'm kind of like
oh ha what are you right now
I've been upstairs or ah she need to get
out of my house so anyways that's it I
love you guys and if you want to see how
I got this look and just kind of
chitchat and hang out and talk about
random stuff then just keep watching hey
guys how's it going welcome back to
another sophisticated tutorial with
Jacqueline okay really though I do not
have time to screw around cuz I actually
do have an event to go to and I have to
leave pretty damn soon so let's get it
poppin prime the base so that you can
beat that face okay so I'm gonna go in
with my foundation first you guys
honestly like recently I have gotten so
stuck and my current foundation routine
is I am so happy with it
I don't even try other things anymore
like I'm just I'm Perry I'm doing a very
full coverage today just so you know
it's kind of like when they say like if
something is wait no that's not it wait
if it's not broken don't fix it that's
where I'm at in life with my foundation
wait where's my foundation I don't
remember the last time that I was this
happy with the way my foundation looked
as the end result and it looks good all
day long so it's like I don't want to
try anything else I know that I should
but it's like I'm just so happy with it
and it's like even after 10 11 12 14
hours my foundation still it's good
so I actually fell asleep through the
night with my foundation on for the
first time I'm not kidding prize since I
was like 17 years old okay let me keep
moving as I'm talking to hold on which
by the way in case you guys haven't seen
my most recent videos I am using the
hourglass vanish stick foundation
combined with the Dior forever
foundation I know it's like an expensive
foundation routine but you know what you
can't put a price on perfection and I'm
gonna grab a damp Beauty sponge and I'm
gonna spray it with a new meal alone but
I'm spraying it with a Lumet I'm just
using the I'm spraying it with the
luminous Duke no I mean I've always used
the top ha when was my - I can't talk
not today
so anyways I fell asleep with my
foundation on the other night like an
idiot but I did I did it I'm not gonna
lie it doesn't matter like what Mike
situation is I could be like deathly ill
with the flu you know I can be like
wasted it doesn't matter what state of
mind that I'm in I will still get my ass
to the bathroom wash my face and brush
my teeth but I was so exhausted last
week I couldn't do it like I had been
running out like three hours of sleep
every night for several nights and I was
like I can't I'm done
cuz brush my teeth and fell asleep in my
full face of makeup on when I woke up
the next morning my foundations to look
perfect
I'm not kidding like I slept like face
down in the pillow like like drooling
and when I woke up my face still looked
perfect now my eye makeup with a
disaster like everything else is a
disaster but my actual foundation was
bombed so I don't know this foundation
routine I'm doing right now I'm just in
love with it and the thing that makes me
love it the most I think is the UM the
using a luminous dewy glowy face mist to
spray my damp Beauty sponge is really
the key to all this I think now of
course the foundations play a big part
the powders play a very big part of
course it all plays a big part in the
end result but there's something about
constantly like every single time I go
back and with my sponge I like stop I
spray it
I totally must I just sprayed my arm but
every single time I go back in I wet the
sponge all over again and there's
something about it how it just like
melts into the skin and makes the
foundation look so full-coverage but yes
so much more natural it's like it
becomes one with your pores maybe I'll
just call this video another drunk
makeup tutorial even though I'm
completely sober it would make sense but
like I've always said even if you are
oily you can use dewy products as long
as you are combining them with other
mattifying products if you're priming
your face with a mattifying like pore
filling primer and then if you're using
like a matte foundation with a glowy
face miss and then a mattifying powder
it's like you're just kind of layering
all those things to get that
three-dimensional really beautiful
natural looking glow you know and it
won't make you look oily it'll just make
you look more natural I am so excited
right on you guys because I'm so close
to hitting 5 million subscribers here on
YouTube and this to me is like just as
surreal and weird as hitting 1 million
subscribers like when I first started
youtube I remember thinking like oh my
god if I were to ever hit 1 million
subscribers like I don't even know what
I would do like I would just bawl my
eyes out for weeks and then I'd hit 1
million subscribers and that's exactly
what I did like it was just
- really I just couldn't believe it I
just like screamed and cried and just
like freaked out and then I remember
when I hit 1 million I have like a a
hair stuck on my face I can know like I
can feel it I remember when I hit 1
million subscribers on YouTube some
people were like oh before you know it
you'll be at 5 million and I was like
haha yeah right you know it's like
there's such a big difference between 1
and 5 and I just never thought that I
would get here and so the fact that this
is happening I almost feel like I'm
having like that weird like butterfly
like huh
towards YouTube right now like it's just
so crazy and I'm just I just can't
believe that this is where my life has
brought me to five million subscribers
here on YouTube and just all of your
love and support and it's just you guys
have absolutely no idea how thankful I
am for you and your constant love and
support and watching my videos and
giving me feedback and constructive
criticism and like even the haters I'm
so thankful for all of it and like I can
actually say that now you know like a
couple years ago maybe even a year ago
or so I could have never have said that
ever but like I am so thankful for
everybody and like being on YouTube has
forced me to grow up and get to know
myself it's taught me so many lessons
it's forced myself to look in the mirror
and take responsibility for certain
things I never would have you know if I
wasn't doing this if I didn't choose
this path in life and I'm just so
thankful for it you know like even the
mean comments like the hater comments
like they used to get to me so bad
people being so nasty and mean to me but
because of that I ended up going to
therapy
I ended up meeting the most incredible
therapist in the entire world and I
ended up figuring out why those comments
bothered me so much I ended up working
through it and making me a better person
who actually knows myself more so it's
like I'm thankful for everything I'm
thankful for the mean people I'm
thinking for the loving people I just
love you so much and even when I don't
deserve your love and don't deserve your
support you guys are always just
reminding me like you're just reminding
me I just love you I love you so much
I'm literally sweating every single time
I talk about it oh my god Oh like I
start to get like boob sweat and like my
ass crack starts gonna be wet Oh God
five million all I'm saying is that I am
so eternally grateful and thankful and I
do not feel and I have never felt and I
don't think
we'll feel like I am deserving of any of
this and even when I feel like crap
about myself I'm having the worst day or
the worst week or the worst month or the
worst year you guys are always here for
me and I just I love you and for that
it's like yeah thanks thank you thank
you just thank you guys I love you okay
so now I'm gonna set my under eyes
recently I have been setting my under
eye area with powder like immediately
when I'm done with my concealer instead
of going in with my face powder first
again hear my voice my voice is so raspy
it's raining really hard today and I
don't know why but every single time it
rains in Florida not during this summer
usually but like this time of year when
it rains in Florida I get like this like
really natthew yeah like it's just
whatever anyways back to Ross saying the
reason I set my under eye area first
before my face is I feel like I have a
less creasing with my concealer when I
set my eye area immediately and I said
oh really really small amount and then I
will go back after I set everything and
like I've done my bronzer my blush and
all that sometimes I'll add a little bit
more but just a tiny bit that way you
don't get like really cakey and crepey
under there because too much power on
the under eye does not look good on
nobody and now I'm gonna set the rest of
my face with my favorite setting powders
which this is the same routine that I've
showed you guys in the last couple of
videos so I don't feel the need to
really go too in depth about what
exactly I'm doing what exactly I'm using
can you guys tell the difference in my
camera quality because I am like a
little shook by it because this is the
same camera that I have been using for a
very long time been like two years I
believe and um my new video editor who
he hasn't actually started yet but he's
actually moving to Florida and going to
be starting in the early summer and he
came down and fill my closet to her for
me and when he was here he adjusted some
settings on my camera and now I feel
like I'm just like so hi-def and like it
just looks so legit I don't even know
what he did but he's just he's magical
but I hope it you guys can know the
difference in the chemically and also
the sound the sound is major improved
okay I'm gonna fill in my eyebrows
really quick and I'll be right back I'm
not gonna record this because it's a
bore fest no one wants to watch the ones
all in the Rose
I can't help it every single time I put
on brows with just my foundation I'm
always like so scared of myself am i
it's just not my good luck
I mean obviously these are very bold I
could've done like a more soft growl but
I'm just feeling bitchy today oh god I
just had to clean off that foundation
off my lips cuz I just hate how crusty
it looks um I wanted to do a winged
liner today but I don't think that time
because I have to leave yourself I
really want to use this Kylie palette
from her weather collection I think it's
called because I want to use this shade
right here on my lid it just looks so
beautiful but the other colors in the
palette I don't want to use with it you
know like I want a little bit more of a
I don't like a purple or a green tone
around it hmm man I need to shade my
face bitches get hairy okay so I think I
was gonna do like a basic look like very
vanilla just simple basic biatch type of
look today to do that I don't know I
don't even know what I'm doing you know
I'm just gonna be honest I was kind of
going with it I'm just doing the motions
I'm thinking something in the warm ish
category but not true I don't know you
never know where it's gonna end up let's
just go with it and see what happens
that's just kind of my motto in life
recently like let's just go with it and
see where the hell we end up um I'm done
trying to plan everything out I feel so
weird right now to be getting ready with
no music on even though like I'm
obviously filming so I can't get ready
with music on but it feels so weird
because recently I have been blasting
music the entire time I get ready and
I've never been like a music listener
when I get ready like I love music and
I'd music playing in my house basically
all day every day but whenever I do my
makeup for some reason I don't like to
have music on I don't know why it's like
a weird thing I know but my whole life
I've always liked to have on like a
movie like I have my iPad next to me
like a movie playing and it like really
calms me and relaxes me but the past
couple of weeks I've really gotten into
just like blasting music on my speaker's
whenever I do my makeup and now it's
like I don't know I'm obsessed like I
look so forward to seeing now I'm just
like listening to my playlist and I have
been obsessed with Demi Lovato's album
recently oh my
God like every single song a minute
every song why don't you feel like my
eyes are gonna get a little bit smokier
than I planned
recently I have been super into the
lower lash line like you guys know that
I always put shadow my lower lash line
like I think I have one tutorial all
time where I don't have anything in my
lower lashline I'm pretty sure it's a
Valentine's Day tutorial other than that
I put something down here every single
day of my life but recently I have been
like obsessed with blowing out this
lower lash so much like almost to the
point like my lower lash line I shadow
like blends into my blush like so far
down I know it sounds weird but there's
something about it just makes your eyes
pop and stand out more so my lower lash
line to me has honestly been more
important than my upper lash line like I
take a little bit of shadow and I
literally like drag this down like I'm I
don't know I'm into it I'm into it you
kind of look like a freak at first but
once the look is done it all comes
together a minute I am so excited you
guys it's only a few days away from the
greatest show man coming out to like be
able to be purchased on like Amazon
which is where I like watch all my
movies like some people do like Hulu or
Vudu I don't know or like all that
difference I don't know I only have
Netflix and then like my Amazon app like
my Amazon Instant whatever it's called
were you just like buy and write movies
anyways I am so excited for the greatest
showmen to come out on DVD like I've
never seen any movie in theaters as many
times as I saw the greatest showmen
I saw it six times in theaters which is
insane I mean know how I found the time
to do it honestly I don't even know
there was one day that I went and saw
like 11:00 a.m. showing I bawled my eyes
out every single time
all six times hair get it together like
in a good cry like a cry that like
motivates me and inspires me and makes
me feel like just some type of way you
know like gosh is so good I'm gonna grab
some of the Patrick Starr powder that he
collaborated with Mac on I'm going to
just tap a little bit of that right
underneath my eye just so that we don't
look a little - could I see once this is
all over with and just clean up a little
bit of that shadow okay so I'm gonna go
in with this color right here from the
Kylie I don't know what this palette is
technically
there is no name on it whatsoever just
cut says Kylie Jenner pressed powder
palette so I'm gonna go in with this
shade right here I don't know if I don't
want to use a brush because it really
looks like it's gonna be a pain in my
royal ass I'm nervous this definitely
looks like it's gonna be oh yeah no no
no no no no I'm gonna use my finger here
that's probably my vibe right now that's
not what I was expecting so now I'm
gonna do I'm going to just not do that
I'm going to grab a couple colors from
my palette and put it down as a base and
then just layer like a little bit of
that over top as like a little like beep
boop that's actually like so pretty just
like mixed together like that in it
you're like lightly bring that over all
the way it's the outer corner because I
kind of want this color to be like
lightly all over the lids like slightly
satiny and blown out oh yeah oh yes okay
so then let me do the exact same thing
that I did on this side that way it
looks the same perfect and in case
you're wondering what shades I'm using
for my palette they are obsessed and SBN
and people always ask me still SBN means
and it stands for a smoky but natural
and I named it that because when I used
to be a freelance makeup artist and I
would do like weddings and prom makeup
all the time and that's what I did every
single client that would sit down in my
chair would always say like I want
something smokey like I wanted to be a
really smoky and like Kim Kardashian ask
but natural like I still want to look
natural but I wanted to be smoky and I'm
big okay so smoky but natural they be
exactly smoky my natural and it doesn't
even like really make sense like how can
it be smoky and natural at the same time
but it makes total sense in my mind and
I always knew exactly what they were
referring to and they're referring to a
color just like this eyeshadow that I
created they want like that all over
kind of like taupe be slightly bronzy
shimmery shade which is like a light
really beautiful brown buffed out on the
crease like a smokey liner like I
understood what they meant so that's why
I named it SBN for that look smoke to be
natural have that and I'm gonna go back
in with that shade from the Carly
palette and I'm going to just like
lightly do a little oh yeah mm-hmm there
we go it's exactly what I wanted ooh
just gives that little like right now
okay and I'm going to go in with a
really dark brown on my lower lash line
I'm gonna put it right tight all right
in tight up against my lash line I'm
doing that pretty sloppy just throwing
it on there I'm gonna go back in with
the shade Roxanne and buff that out I'm
just buffing the edges of that out
because I do not want to see any harsh
lines I did not want to see where this
shadow on my lower lash line begins or
ends I just want it to be eternal like
my love I'm gonna put some white liner
on my inner waterline because I don't
want to do black today I don't know why
I sky want to keep this like more pop in
and then a black smokey eye I'm gonna
put some mascara on so I can throw on
some lashes
okay back I'm back I'm gonna go in with
a little shade stir by MAC Cosmetics I
made you a little contour slash bronze
action we'll see where we end up I don't
really know I'm just going with it today
I'm using the morphe y one brush to do
this just kind of get it done quickly I
don't want do anything too precise right
now because I actually do have to get
going pretty soon and I still need to go
upstairs and shave my legs I'm wearing
shorts so it's like trying to save time
just kind of rush through this which is
why I skipped out on the eyeliner and
then I'll just straighten my hair
instead of curling it because curling my
hair takes way too much time even though
I've timed it and I think it's like at
this point is around like 13 to 15
minutes it takes to curl my hair still
like I can straighten my hair in like
six minutes so whenever I'm rushing I'm
like let's just do this instead I have
to sculpt this out a little bit it just
looks messy and I'm not about it right
now I'm going to warm up my nose a
little bit using the Makeup Forever
bronzer and the shade 10 M which is much
lighter than the contour shade that I
use on my face but I don't want it to be
too intense on my nose so I go with a
lighter shade instead and I just picked
up a random brush this is one of the
Kylie brushes and I don't I don't know
I'm just using something random
something to get her a little warmth on
the face okay I'm gonna just put this
powder on the side of my nose so that
this looks a little bit more sculpted
when I wipe it away and this Patrick
Starr powder is really really like
natural-looking and beautiful so you
really can't overdo it it doesn't like
erase as much as a typical transit
powder which I'm sure he did on purpose
okay so now that I got that going on I'm
going to grab a little bit of the Mac
Pro emphasize um highlighting powder
it's not highlighting powers of shaping
powder
looks like this adds a little bit of a
sheen in it I use it in almost every
single video it's like one of my rider
dies and then I'm also gonna go back in
with the Kat Von D shade light palette
and grab this first shade right here
which I basically have known left oh so
it's like it's just the tip in there
mm-hmm
that's what she said sorry it was too
much I'm gonna mix those two together
and I'm gonna put this on my under eye
area and the center of my face and the
reason why I feel like right now
everything just looks like very flat in
one dimension like the bronzer and the
eye shadow everything have kind of just
like come together as one and I don't
want that I want you to be able to see
the dimension of the skin with the
bronzer and the highlight and the eyes
and all that so that's why I do this
step and I didn't put my mascara on my
bottom lashes yet on purpose because I'm
knowing I'm going to be doing this step
I will just go and cover up the mascara
cuz I am touching my bottom lashes right
now so I wait to do my mascara alas
let's just wipe this away over here now
for blush I'm gonna go in with a
generous amount because I really have
been into like very powerful looking
like pinky copper cheeks recently I
don't know I was having like a love
affair of blush right now so I'm gonna
go in with the morphe 9b palette this
isn't my go-to it's the only thing I
took with me to LA and I've just been
loving it so I'm gonna go in with those
shades and like I said put on a generous
amount I'm gonna kind of blend it in to
that contour area bring it in on the
inner apples of the cheeks just blend
this all together okay so now that my
cheeks are covered and pinky coral I'm
gonna go back in with that beauty sponge
and just dab it over top just to kind of
mesh everything together I'm gonna go
with the hourglass ambient lighting
highlighter and I'm gonna take that same
brush and just put it over the apples as
a nice glow just gonna like slightly
kind of sweep that almost everywhere
because it is such a natural glow from
within get it up there a little bit in
the forehead for highlight I want to try
at this Kylie one because I love Kylie's
highlighters we're gonna use this one
right here let's see it actually makes
with a pinch of this but mainly this
wanna
oh yeah it's so like natural and just
like creamy and wet looking it's so
beautiful oh I love that Wow
let me hit my inner corners with a
little light just for a little pop
effect my eye is just kind of look dead
without this step so for lips I'm gonna
go in with the Smashbox liquid lipstick
in a shade fair game this is one of my
favorite favorite nude liquid lips as it
recently
okay so last but not least I'm gonna set
my face with some more if you preppin
set is there any left in here hug thank
God thank God thank God thank God and
then just because I'm not extra and I
want to glow even worse night I'm going
to go in with the Lyla be a glow face
miss as well right over top of that oh
it's not so good okay so that is it for
this chit chat to get ready with me I am
off I have to leave my house in 30
minutes I still have to go shake my legs
straighten my hair get dressed let my
dogs out
