small little tidbit of what it's like to
live my everyday life I just wake up to
puppies and champagne and diamonds and
there's no hard work ever involved in
what I do
no seriously thank you so much for
joining me today and welcome back to my
channel
I am so excited from this video also a
little bit nervous but that's okay we're
gonna get over it at this time this is
the most requested video on my channel
which is my closet tour so without
further ado let's just get started
so when you first walk into my closet on
the left hand side you see my shoes
which is honestly I think my favorite of
my entire closet because shoes are my
thing my mother taught me at a very
young age that it doesn't matter how big
how small you are how much weight you
gain you might not fit into your jeans
but you can always fit into your shoes
so I have carried that all with me for
my whole life and I could make honestly
an hour video about the stories behind
the moments and the memories behind my
shoes so this is why I love this entire
area so much and it's because of my
sister this entire shoe shelf is
actually what it is and also my handbag
shelf which you will see very shortly
she is the mathematician of the family
let's get real I just do makeup all
right but my sister she's the Brainiac
so she literally went through my entire
shoe collection when I was moving into
this house she counted every single one
she measured them I know I know she's a
genius and she came up with this entire
setup right here so and it's a closet it
goes from like over-the-knee boots to
then shorter booties so then heels well
we did it differently because I do live
in Florida which is usually a very warm
climate so we did or any boots at the
bottom but then all the actual booties
for more winter are up at top because
this is my most used section right here
in between which is what I grab on a
daily basis right here I also over on
the left hand side I have all of my
sneakers and I have all of my colorful
shoes as well so this shoe right here is
one of the most special pairs in my
closet because this I actually wore in
the marketing campaign for my morphe
palette the Jacqueline Hill palette
linda surprised me on set that day with
this shoe and i was just like oh my god
they're so beautiful I feel like
Cinderella like I was so excited you
guys have seen this photo I posted on
Instagram but after the shoot was over
with I was like thank you so much for
letting me use this shoe I feel like
such a princess and it's like oh no
those are yours and I was like what so I
kept joking like I want to put them in a
box and I want to frame them because I
just felt like such a princess with how
sparkly they are like anyone who knows
me knows I love to Sparkle and then I
mean I'm gonna be honest I love them so
much
then I came home and I bought my bitch
ass the same pair of rose gold because I
just you know what I feel like I
deserved it so I did next pair of shoes
I have a
here because I feel like these are the
coolest pair of shoes I have in my
closet they are so just like 1970s disco
diva
I bought these specifically for my
Halloween costume because I threw this
awesome Halloween party with my friends
and my family I dress up as like a
clowns skull and I wore these that night
and I actually jumped into the pool at
the end of the night because my friend
aside to jump in I jumped in we all
jumped in it was a great night and I got
so much hate on Instagram because
everyone said that I ruined my expensive
shoes but joke's on you because
Lanesville perfect
my next favorite shoe the most worn shoe
in my closet I think is this booty right
here by Rachel's oh and the reason that
I love this shoe so much is because I
got it on sale with my mom I've owned
this for over four years
they are so damaged they are so used in
abuse I've had them fixed two times
because they keep falling apart but I
never want to get rid of them because
they're just so comfortable these have
walked the streets of Atlanta Chicago
New York Los Angeles Florida I have been
everywhere in these shoes and I just
love them I've had a few people be like
they look like crap on your wall they're
just not there they don't match the vibe
and I'm like screw you to me like these
are so sentimental and I love them so
much I will never get rid of this shoe
like even if one day I don't like them
anymore I'll always keep them because I
just have so much sentiment with this
pair of booties right here so a lot of
people say that Louboutins are not
comfortable and I can agree there are
some shoes that he makes that aren't the
best but overall I actually think they
really are comfortable and this is my
most warm pair of Christian Louboutin
you can see the inside it's like bitch
wash your feet they're so nasty inside
it's not even cute anymore
they're so worn down I've ran in the
rain in these shoes you can see the
bottom like I've worn them so much they
need this sole needs to be replaced like
I just love these and the reason why is
because I feel like from the front it's
like she's a lady in the street but
she's a freak in the bed you know I'm
saying like it's got that edgy sex
appeal on the back and it's my favorite
like when I feel like I have to be like
Elena to be cute today but I still need
to let those bitches know that's when I
prone that though I just have to show
you one more shoe I have to give a
shout-out to my best friend Jackie
because this shoe right here every
single time I have worn this she always
talks about how badly she wants to cut
off her toes because she is two sizes
bigger than me and she's always like
that is literally a leather jacket
in a shoe this is my dream I let me try
find the shoe for so long to buy for her
and it has been sold out is not
available on her size it's so
frustrating but it is so cute so one day
if you see Jackie wearing this then you
will know that she had reconstruction
surgery on her toes in order to fits
into this shoe because it's it's Jackie
shoe so the way I have my closet
organized is as you will see as we move
down the line everything is organized
lightest to darkest kind of like the RGB
color wheel and every single section so
once it becomes a new color category
like orange it always starts off with
something that is like strapless - a
tiny little spaghetti - a short sleeve -
a mid sleeve and then a long sleeve and
so the story goes that's how I have my
entire closet organized I usually just
take all my clothes and just throw it
into my closet however I wanted and on a
daily basis I always literally felt like
that typical girl who's laying on the
floor screaming and crying and everyone
was like really shut up like this is so
stupid so once I organized my closet and
color coordination I felt like wow I
have a lot of clothes and so now if I'm
like okay today I want to wear a white
tank top I know exactly where to go to
my closet I know that my white tank tops
gonna be the very first thing in my
closet my spaghetti straps and my tanks
are right here and it's the same thing
for everything in the entire closet so
right below my tops in this section in
particular this is where I keep dress
pants why I say dress pants I mean like
you know like embellish pants red pants
Beetlejuice pants like and then right
here I have all of my miniskirts like
anything that's like a shorter skirt
like this guy or right here is gonna be
hanging in this area along with my
shorts because you guys know on a
typical daily basis I'm in leggings I'm
in jeans I'm not gonna be wearing this
stuff every day of my life I wish I did
but it's just not realistic so we
thought that this corner right here was
perfect for all of the pants shorts and
skirts so this is my dress department
right here I have my maxi dresses over
in that back corner which is very small
cuz I'm not really a maxi dress type
girl so dressy dresses more casual
dresses they all hang out right here
denim dresses this is where they all
live I will be honest there's a
not even though I've worn it that's
embarrassing honestly but like that's
what I do like I'll keep tabs on nah cuz
I'm gonna return it like I'll just
forget to take it off because I'm that
lazy like I get dressed so frantically I
spend so much time on my makeup and I
neglect my hair I forget to count the
tags I round the door is where I'm at in
life so just accept but a lot of these
dresses at this time I'll be honest I
actually don't even fit into like this
one right here honey this is not my best
at some point I'm gonna decide to give
up Doritos and donuts and get back into
this mode with 30 years 30 pairs of
Spanx but in the meantime I'm keeping it
so a lot of this section doesn't really
get touched as of right now because I'm
not in my best place but this is where
the dresses hang out with a random suit
because this is the only suit that I own
but I loved it so much that we were just
like we're just gonna keep this suit
right here and this is gonna be like my
boss moment so if you guys ever see me
wearing this suit just know that I am
feeling my oats okay so now moving on to
the rest of the closet same thing as
before all of my tops are in the same
midsection of the entire closet so now
we just ended at like lime greens so now
we start to go into forest greens and
same thing like spaghetti - short sleeve
- mid sleeve - long sleeve all different
tones of greens and then we go into
blues and then we go into Gray's and
then we get to the best apartment in my
opinion which is the black because I
love to wear black it's my favorite
color to wear when I feel like I'm too
pale when I feel like I'm too orange or
I'm not having a good day when I'm
having a great day black always works
with black I can wear white jewelry I
can wear yellow gold jewelry I can wear
rose gold jewelry so black is my
favorite favorite color so you see my
closet I have a lot I respect the girls
out there who can wear color all the
time that's just not my journey I am
just like all about the black the dark
shades so that is what this entire
section from here on out of my closet is
just all of my blacks so now right
beneath all of those tops we have I'll
be honest my most used section in the
entire closet which is all of my hoodies
and again they are in color-coordinated
order from lights to mediums darks
there's a few things that are kind of
out of place like where does the blue go
and like this random green one right
here but like you know what who cares we
can't mean that psychopath sometimes
this is my everyday life I swear like
every single morning I wake
I got a pair of leggings out of my
drawer and I'm like what hoodie am I
gonna wear today that's just my life and
then over here on the left hand side of
that is where I have all of my pants as
far as denim and leather goes so it
starts off again from white to a light
wash denim to dark to leather to black
and then I have my Gray's because that's
just the way I wanted to do it I wanted
to put my graze the very end and then
with my conductor pants my plaid
conductor pants I like to call them I've
been wearing a lot recently and this is
just again one of my favorite sections
because I'm always on the mission for
the perfect denim and at this time in my
closet every single pair currently fits
me and are comfortable and I have worked
very very so are you guys it's been so
tough to work for this and I finally
earned it so I'm in a good place so this
section is the most exciting section I
know I keep saying that doesn't my
favorite this is my favorite but this is
actually the most exciting section of my
entire closet right here because these
are already pre styled outfits this is
literally my share moment from clueless
but I actually had one of my favorite
stylist from LA come down to Tampa and
help me style piece for my closet
because I love fashion so much and I
love certain pieces but I am not that
good at styling and that's just that's
where I'm at in life you know I know my
faults so we actually created a book and
we took photos of all the outfits that
she styled for me like every single
outfit that she styled that we put in
this binder right here and I leave this
right here and this is every single
outfit she styled and the reason I did
that is because I do live a very
fast-paced life and there are days where
I have to wake up really early I have to
get out of my house I have to you know
go to meetings I have to look fabulous
but I just I suck at that like I'll go
to my closet the big okay I want to wear
this jacket but I don't know how and I'm
all stressed so she came down here and
she helped me put together all these
outfits so now I don't have to use my
brain I just open up my book I see this
is what I want to wear today this is my
vibe today I go over I grab it and the
entire outfit is there and ready to go
this is literally my goal in life here
this is my goal in life I have dreamt
about this moment since I watched
clueless when I was 7 years old so this
right here is the most exciting part of
my closet thank you to Jill this is my
handbag wall I know I keep saying this
is my favorite
but this is actually like oh my god
basically the way we set this up is I
wanted it to feel like a boutique
because I have always felt like there is
no point in having nice if you can't let
your friends and family enjoy it with
you so anytime someone wants to go out
they have a date they just feel like you
know they just wanna feel themselves
that night they come over to my house
they shot my closet they take my stuff
for a week or so so I wanted to set this
up to literally feel like you're walking
into like yes what do I want like
color-coordinated organized perfection
so that's what I've got going on right
here I've got like my neutrals together
I've got my pops of color like my yellow
section my red section right here this
is actually my newest purchase by
Giuseppe this bag actually owns my heart
this is my heart and soul like if I
could create a bag this would be it like
the only thing better then raining men
is raining diamonds so I'm in it he's
already man this bag right here is
actually one of the most sentimental
bags in my closet it is a Chanel boy bag
that I purchased in New York City and
the reason that this one out of all of
them means so much to me is because we
were shopping together one day in New
York like all my friends and family
we're all there together and I love this
so much and I kept picking up and
putting it down and picking it up and
putting it down you know this was years
ago and I would just I don't know I
don't deserve it I don't need it I don't
deserve it like it's too much ugh I just
felt so weird and my brother pulled me
aside and he was like Jacqueline if you
love this bag get it you deserve it you
are worth so much more than this bag
it's just a bag and he's made me feel so
like you're right I can do this and I
just felt so like important for my
brother and I just felt so loved by him
so every single time I wear this I
always think of him and it makes me so
happy inside it's so sentimental and you
guys will notice if you go through my
Instagram I actually wear this bag more
than anything else just because of the
sentiment behind it it's just it's a
very very special day I'm gonna grab
this one you guys don't judge me for the
way I okay I will say in general for
anybody who ever asks what is your
favorite most warm bag in general just
as far as like wanting to purchase a
designer bag there's Avanti Antigona is
my number one favorite because it is so
easy to carry it's easy to travel with
like it's got this perfect strap or over
your shoulder and the zipper is so great
there's so much room inside of it like
this is just like the best bag
I honestly worn this so much the inside
of this is not something that I'm proud
of because I have just beaten this up
because I wear it all the time I would
say that overall in the entire closet
this is the most practical bag that I
own other than like a Louboutin never
fall this is where it's truly active so
for the most part I like to keep my
smaller like little tiny evening bags
and my clutches up towards the top of my
closet I do have a few of them mixed in
throughout the rest of the handbags but
the majority of them are up high over to
the side I have them kind of splayed by
my window that way when I walk in every
day I can see them because I'm not gonna
get into every single thing but almost
all of like my really like snazzy
over-the-top bags do you have a
sentimental value I purchase them for
myself or they were given as gifts
during something that was like really
monumental in my life so I just felt
like oh my god I need this so I love to
see them every single day so I keep a
lot of bags lower in that sense but in
reality I'm going to be using like the
more practical bags are in this
midsection and down low more than I'm
gonna be using the small evening bags up
high and then over to the left hand side
is where I keep a lot of my backpacks
and at some point I was keeping them all
just kind of like down the floor but
they're all kind of losing their shape
and losing their mold and just getting
kind of like sad and depressing so we
hung them up because it just it makes
them look brand new all the time and I
want my bags to always look great
because I respect my bags they're like
my children all kind of don't judge me
so now back to the actual clothing at
part of my closet my jackets are the
biggest item that takes up the most room
in this entire place they own my closet
so this section right here
are all my jackets and then I also have
my jackets literally on the entire top
shelf of everything like I said the
middle section is all my tops and the
bottom is my hoodies and my pants and
all that the entire top section is all
jackets so leather jackets green jackets
45 denim jackets just jackets everywhere
because I feel personally like I can
throw on just like a pair of sweatpants
and a cute jacket and for some reason
I'm like oh I'm good to go
BAE this year like five
I mean that's actually not the truth but
for me jackass is just my thing like
jackets shoes bags that is my thing
so last but not least is the jewelry of
the closet and I am a hoop whore as the
majority of you know so this is my hoop
drawer that's we custom made these with
California closets right here to hold
all the different sizes of my hoops the
bigger the hoop the bigger the hoe you
know how it is so this is just my
dedicated hoop earring drawer and then
once we move over here this is my actual
like earring earring drawer now I do
have some hoops in here as well just
because I'm starting to get to that
point where I'm becoming such a hoe that
my first drawer came and fit my hoop so
where's come overflowing at this point
everything that you can possibly see so
as you can see in general I do like gold
and silver and rose gold because those
are my favorites but I do have some pops
of color for I'm feeling frisky too
between the summertime I like blue it's
like blue complements dark hair in my
eyes so you know and then right here I
have my chokers so this is my choker
drawer and this is just the best way
that i have found to organize these
types of things because when it comes to
chokers i can't really find like certain
compartments to hold them so i kind of
lay them out and let them be like this I
have found they've never gotten tangled
and I love chokers so much so this is
one of my most used drawers right here
like my dainty ones I just try to keep
them laid a really nice and flat so that
they don't get tangled up together and
that's how I store those so now we are
back to where we first entered the
closet in the first place next to all of
the shoes and when you open up this
right here this is where I keep all of
my dainty necklaces because danger
necklaces are my most worn thing as you
can see it's a lot a lot of pieces in
here still have the price tags on it
because I buy so much dainty jewelry
whether it's real whether it's fake I
just love dainty jewelry so much it's my
favorite I love to layer jewelry I am
all about just like a layered neck it's
my favorite thing I rarely wear big huge
statement necklaces because this is what
I'm all about so we actually found these
things right here on Amazon for just a
couple bucks each I want to say they're
like in between three and five dollars
and it's literally just a sticker on the
back that just like sticks right onto
the wood and it's good to go
we thought of all different ideas of a
way to store all my dainty necklaces and
this is the best solution that we could
come up with so I can just shut my door
and I haven't
on the back and that's where I clasp all
my necklaces on last but certainly most
likely not least is my sunglass
collection I love sunglasses if you
can't tell I'm all about the accessories
I'm all about the shoes the jewelry the
handbag the sunglasses the jackets like
I don't even care about the main outfit
I only care about the accessories of the
outfit so I am a sunglass whore as I am
a hoop or and I tried really hard to get
like individual compartments to fit my
sunglasses so they wouldn't touch they
wouldn't scrape they'd be so perfect and
prepped all the time but that just that
wasn't my life so instead we have them
all laying out like this right here in
the drawer I love it though because I
get to open up every single day and see
what the fuck is up right here is like
my aviator section with like my blockier
sunglasses my more cat eye I have a
theme that kind of works in my mind for
my glasses and then up here these are
all my most recent sunglasses which are
all by the brand key and no this is not
sponsored but keeps one response to me
hey it's a girl let me know where to
find me
um I actually went to San Francisco
recently and hung out their headquarters
they surprised me and they gave me all
these glasses and I was so excited I was
like jumping up and down like a kid I
was actually acting like super cool I
was like oh thanks it's like so nice of
you but then inside when I left so I had
them all displayed right here because
when you get something new it's like the
fun thing like every time I get like a
new foundation and it's like expensive
and I feel like still like bougie about
it I have to keep it in its packaging
for a couple of weeks that's feel like
zombies so that's why I have all of my
keys sitting out right now and I
absolutely love them so yeah that's it
you guys I love you so much I hope that
you enjoyed this closet tour I have a
fabulous week don't forget to subscribe
like the video hit that Bell and I'll
see you guys my next one bye
