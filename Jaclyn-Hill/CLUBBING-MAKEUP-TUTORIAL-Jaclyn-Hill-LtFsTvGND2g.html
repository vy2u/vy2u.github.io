tutorial for you guys on my way out to
work I posted a picture of a client of
mine on Instagram like a couple days ago
and in the picture it was this makeup
look I like to call this look a clubbing
makeup look just because I feel like
it's perfect for a night out where you
want to have like smokey eyes but you
don't want to just go with that like
classic boring black or brown you want
to amp it up in some way but still keep
it sexy and fun so I love this color I
love the main color I'm working with as
a pigment I've worn this look for years
I cannot get sick of it it looks
beautiful on so many different skin
tones this will look amazing on you if
you are extremely dark as well very
light I mean it's amazing I love it
so much fun so I really hope that you
guys enjoy the tutorial and I will talk
to you soon
so first thing I did today was prime my
eyes with Mac painterly paint-pot I am
going to take this from lash line all
the way up to eyebrows it's a very
creamy formula it's basically the exact
same color as skin and this will just
ensure that your eye makeup doesn't
crease or fade throughout the day then
I'm going to take Mac's soft Brown I'm
going to take this on a pretty fluffy
brush doesn't really matter whatever
brush you have of your preference this
is a Mac 224 brush but this was a
limited one that's why it has a gold
handle this one was from a Holiday
Collection from awhile ago and this is
just the one I prefer
but anyways we'll go deeper into brushes
in my next brush video I'm taking this
color and I'm focusing it on the outer
corner and where I first place the brush
but then I'm going to bring it in
staying above the crease all the way
into my inner corner I don't really have
any rhyme or reason and doing this this
is our transition shade so you can just
blow it out anywhere you please and then
this color is brown script you can see
it's one of my favorites because I have
hit pan on it I use it all the time and
we're gonna this is a sigma brush I
don't know the name of it though but
it's a lot like the Mac 217 I'm going to
take this and I'm going to just put it
densely in that crease basically the
exact same motions that I just did with
soft brown but this time we're going to
keep it lower we don't want to bring it
up as high as we did the soft Brown
because we want it to be layered so this
one I turn my brush sideways to kind of
blend and you want to move in circular
motions that will really make sure that
there's no lines in any of your blending
but I really push it in there in that
outer corner and then I turn my brush
sideways and I move back and forth and
windshield wiper motions and then little
tiny miniature circles and that will
really blend everything out for the next
shade that we're going to go in with
I'll go back with that same brush that I
used before with no additional products
and I'll just run over everything just
to kind of blur out because once again
this is not the main focus of our look
the next color that we're going on with
is what's really going to make all this
pop so this just needs to be blended
well so then I'm going to go in with Mac
blue brown pigment I have the full size
but I can't find it right now and this
is the miniature from a holiday set a
while ago so oh gosh it's so amazing I'm
going to use a 224 brush I'm sorry a 242
brush which is just a flat synthetic
shader brush I'm going to take mac's
fix+ and I'm just gonna
wet my brush you can spray it directly
on there really close or far away
however you feel and then I'm just going
to start packing this onto the lid if
you've never used pigment before it's
just a loose eyeshadow it's the exact
same thing it just normally has a lot
more pigment to it has a lot of color
and a lot of depth I love using pigments
a tiny little jar pigment will last few
years that it goes so far it's insane so
I'm pulling my eyelid a little tight
because when I do this look if I don't
tug on my eye a little bit I'm going to
get tons and tons of fallout and it's
not going to look the same and I want it
to look really crinkly and I want it to
look really metallic so therefore I pull
my eyelid a little bit just to get that
color and every single little area and
then when I let go it looks crinkly and
metallic which is a huge trend right now
and then I take that brush after I have
that color all over the lid and I push
it into my crease area and I just kind
of carve that area out because you want
this color you don't want it to go too
far but yet you still want it to have a
little bit of height so you can see how
I'm carving out my crease right now from
inner corner to outer eye just kind of
round out and make sure it's all in that
area okay moving on Swiss chocolate
another one of my favorites it doesn't
look much like Swiss chocolate in this
shot right here but it has a little bit
of a red tone hands-down favorite Brown
in the entire world I'm going to take
this on the 217 on the outer corners
corner is where we're going to
concentrate this color and then just
with whatever is left on that brush just
kind of bring it in just to blend it all
out make it look smooth and put together
but this color is a much deeper color so
I want this tone to be on that outer
corner just for that kind of cat is
effect which this is not necessary you
can use any Brown for this part if you
want but I just really love the
difference with this blue brown pigment
and then these red tones I think it just
really embraces the brown inside this
pigment I just I can't get enough of
this look you have no idea so as you can
see I turn my brush to the side to
really blend everything out and then I
always go back with my clean brush that
doesn't have any additional product on
it from the first time I use it with
soft Brown and I just fling it over
everything just to make sure there's no
harsh lines and this will really make
everything look buffed
and put together so there's nothing you
know no jagged edges and then I'm using
Maybelline eye studio which is a gel
liner in the shade blackest black I love
this liner so much if you want to see
how I do my eyeliner on a daily basis
you can watch my eyeliner video I have
that here on my channel as of right now
once again I tug on my lid just so that
I can get in there nice and deep
otherwise this pigment is just going to
fall down and cover everything up
and then I'm using red cherry lashes and
number 43 these are my favorites happen
forever if you watch my channel you know
that I'm a little addicted to red cherry
lashes and number 43 and then I'm gonna
take just any mascara that's you know a
really black shade and I'm gonna go
underneath on my natural lashes and just
get that color on there to cover them up
and make them look a little bit more
natural sometimes I'll even squeeze my
natural lashes with my false ones with
my fingers just to kind of bind them
together so that it looks even more
natural all those little tips and tricks
I'm using L'Oreal Lumi foundation in
shade w5 and I'm using a Beauty Blender
which is my new obsession don't get me
wrong I still use the Sigma kabuki brush
the f80 everyday for my foundation well
that's a lie I don't use it every day
but I use it I switch back and forth
between the two but I love love love
this Beauty Blender right now you have
no idea it just makes it so amazing and
you're it's like it's foolproof to not
have perfect foundation okay and then
I'm going to use Mac's prep and prime
highlighter and radiant rose dab that
all underneath my eyes however much
product you see fit I don't use an
insane amount just a little bit and then
I go in with Mac's Pro Longwear
concealer this is shade nw20
I'm going to turn that beauty blender
sponge around and I'm going to use the
tip of it just to dab all of that
concealer I love this because it makes
it so that your concealer isn't cakey it
doesn't settle it just makes it so that
it's perfect it looks so airbrushed and
smoothes out with this beauty blender i
absolutely love it i still use other
methods to apply my foundation and
concealer but as of right now this is my
absolute favorite and don't mind the
faces that i made while i'm applying my
concealer and foundation I tend to
forget I'm recording and my mouth is
like hanging open the entire time it's
not cute anyways moving on
I'm just going to use this bully just to
buff out my eyebrows just if there's any
foundation in there then I'm going to
use a Mac to one two or to one twelve
brush and I'm going to just take the
eyeshadow quark and I'm going to start
on the lower line of the eyebrow and I
always trace that out and then I go on
the outer tail and I kind of round out
that area and just deepen it up and then
I'll go back with the spoolie once again
when I'm done and I'll buff it all out
and that's basically how I do my brows
whenever I'm doing a really dramatic eye
and then I have my way of doing it on a
day to day look at the difference okay
I'm gonna use shroom which is my
all-time favorite highlighting color by
Mac I use it on basically everybody I
think it's perfect not too much pink or
gold it's just a perfect light shade I'm
gonna put this underneath my brow just
as that highlight and then I'm going to
use Mac's Pro highlighting powder in
light sweep I believe this is I'll have
all the products listed below though the
description bar along with information
about everything in case you're
interested but I'm just gonna put that
underneath the eye area just to
highlight this is my favorite
highlighter right now I can't use it
when I'm tan so I'm embracing it while I
am fair okay I'm going to go back in
with brown script on that same two one
two brush and I'm going to just buff
that under my eye just putting it right
in that lashline pretty precisely and
then what I'll do is I will take max
texture which is a lighter brown it has
a little bit of shimmer in it not much
and this will make it really easy to
buff that out because if you just try to
buff out a color as deep as brown script
on its own it might look like a hot mess
I'm just saying you might get a lot of
fallout and it will just be kind of jab
D not smooth if you use another color
that's a little lighter especially if it
has a little bit of shimmer in it and
it's not all matte it'll make it way
easier to blend and I'm just using a
pencil brush every single brand sells
one of these it's just a little tiny
dome shaped pencil brush and I just
continue to just buff it out from inner
corner to outer corner and this just
makes it really easy now I have a
two-tone under eye area instead of one
looks very pretty
shroom once again I'm going to take this
on a tiny little shader brush I love
this little brush it's so tiny and I'm
going to highlight my inner corner just
to give a little bit more attention to
the eye area I really like doing this
with
basically any makeup look because it
really brightens up and opens up the
eyes especially when we're using dark
colors that can close the eyes okay I am
using mac mineralize skinfinish powder
in the shade medium dark which is
actually my bronzer color right now
because I don't want my bronzer to be
really dark for this eye color I mean
for this face that we're doing today
because I already have a lot going on in
the eye so I like to keep everything
else much more neutral so I'm just using
this as a bronzer I don't want anything
overboard and I'm just gonna kind of
sculpt the face with a huge powder brush
around the forehead down on the cheeks
maybe drag it along the jaw line but I
want to keep it on the natural side and
I'm gonna take Mac's Melba this is a
matte shade blush and I'm going to take
it on a 1:29 blush brush which is one of
my favorite blush brushes ever and I'm
gonna drag it along the apples of the
cheeks up to the outer parts of my face
I know I make really really weird facial
expressions when I apply blush I can't
talk about it recording myself has
brought a lot of things to my attention
and I'm like this is not okay I look
really weird when I do my makeup but
that's alright I'm gonna take mary-lou
manizer by the balm this is a beautiful
highlighter but I can't show it to you
because it's broken it completely
shattered yay Gomis I'm just gonna take
this and just highlight the cheekbones
sadly you can't see it because of my
natural daylight shining on my face I
wish you could see the highlighter color
it's gorgeous it's like a white gold
shade it's not super super yellowy but
it's not white it's it's such an awesome
highlighter and then I'm gonna take a
Maybelline mascara I don't remember the
name of this one but I will put it in
the description box below and I'm just
gonna drag this along my lower lashes
cuz I always have to do this it's just a
necessity for me to finish off this look
I'm taking Japanese maple lipstick and
apply that to the lips I realized I
didn't like how new this was so I did
put a pink gloss on it after the video
was done but other than that we're all
done I love you guys forever have a
great day mwah I'll see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
