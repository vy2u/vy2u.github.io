swatch er ever like my new iPhone
hi everybody I'm back you have no idea
how weird it's been not filming and
talking to you guys and like keeping up
with you and doing tutorials these last
couple of weeks it has been so strange
and I am so glad to be back here um so
just a quick catch up I was in Chicago
for almost a month and that's where I
was with my sister and her family and
just spending time with my family up in
Chicago and just trying to vacate myself
and relax anyways so getting back to the
point while I was there I did a lot of
shopping a lot and lots of shopping and
so many of you guys have asked me to do
a haul because if you don't follow me on
Instagram and Twitter
then you should you want to keep up with
my life at all but I posted so many
pictures of like places that I was
shopping at and things that I was buying
and trying to keep you guys up a little
bit on what hat is happening in my life
and everyone wanted to see like a
collective haul of my trip in Chicago so
I'm going to do a beauty haul today I
did buy you know other things you know
like clothes and I got some home decor
and stuff like online while I was there
but we're just going to keep it beauty
today so I want to show you guys
everything I got
don't judge me it is a luck and when I
say a lot I don't think I've ever bought
this much this many beauty products and
my life in a month period like literally
never but I knew I was going to Chicago
for a couple of months and I was saving
my money because I knew when I went
there I was gonna go crazy because I
have been wanting to her so long okay so
the first place was Ulta um I got a lot
of Ulta I think I would they're two
different times but I just kind of
compiled it all into one bag so I'm
going to start with the things I got
from there first I got the real
technique brushes two brushes from them
and I like them they're not brushes that
I grab everyday but I thought that these
might be a little fun to try so I got
these two brushes right here this is the
just your base flawless powder brush and
this is the core collection I got these
and these are at Ulta um I also saw them
at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond as well like the
ones that have the
medic section I saw them there and then
I picked up a bunch of our del lashes I
got these just because I can never have
too many lashes especially if you know
I've been doing a lot of freelance work
and in my kit it's nice to have these
lashes these aren't mainly the only
lashes I use but I like to have them in
there for backup because you never know
what's going to happen so and they're
really cheap these were on sale for like
350 apiece so I just grabbed a bunch of
them they're just like the whispies in
the 120 Demi the 138 and I'm apologizing
for my nails I had acrylics on and they
grew up for so long I just took them off
um
137 and more whiskies so got the lashes
and then I had to have fun with the
Kardashian line so I got their nude lip
kit this is their all-natural kit and
it's like one of their joy sticks in a
lip gloss and it looks like so and I'm
sorry if you're seeing a big reflection
from a huge window in the background but
this is what's happening right now I'm
filming in front of my desk I actually
bought it yesterday and set it up um
it's from Ikea anyways I am doing like
insane spring cleaning my house is a
tornado right now so this is where I am
filming so it's happening okay so I got
this and then you can see the color of
the new lip on the back um I really
really like these joysticks I love them
they have great pigmentation they last a
really long time so I got a few of those
I got that one and then I got these
three
I got baby doll sea coral and shocking
pink so I love the shocking pink one
this is like seriously BAM in-your-face
pink I absolutely love this I wore this
a lot I've been really really into
bright lips recently like the whole time
I was in Chicago I was wearing bright
lips with just a neutral eye kind of
like I'm wearing right now the one next
to it is sea coral and then I will show
you baby doll this one right here is
baby's also I just really really like
these I like the smell of them they go
on like
on the lips and they stay for a really
long time they don't give you like that
weird chunky separation after you had on
for a couple of hours they're very
moisturizing so I like those and then I
got a pair of lashes by the Kardashian
chroma which is these are the gaze
lashes and you can see they're like
thicker and the center and then thinner
on each end so I thought that they would
be fun way to give some fullness to the
eyes yeah okay and then I got some NYX
lip pencils because I really like these
pencils I'm wearing one of them right
now I am wearing the hot red one which
is just a true red color you can see it
on my lips and then I got fuchsia dolly
pink and rose and they look like so and
if I feel like I shouldn't be swatching
everything for you guys because it's
just a hot mess
but if you show right there I wear this
with the Kardashian joystick that bright
pink one all the time I wore that
probably five or six times while I was
there in Chicago and then this is rose
right there and then this is Dolly pink
the very end it's just a really really
nice cool tone pink it's got a little
bit of purple in it so yeah I really
like these NYX lip pencils and they're
like five dollars a piece I really
really like them I have been enjoying
drugstore lip colors recently a lot
speaking of drugstore lip colors haha I
posted a photo on Instagram last night
of all of these Maybelline vivid that I
have I have eight of them now because
I've got obsessed this is ridiculous
but I went I got one and I got the I
think it was shocking coral or maybe
coral crush I don't know I got one first
and I was so obsessed that I had to go
back and get all of them because I was
like these are the best lipsticks ever
like they're great lipsticks I like
these as much as I like Chanel lipsticks
if not better like these are not joking
are awesome if you're one of those
people who like don't believe in
drugstore products or drugstore
lipsticks and you have to go to the
department store trust me if you're
going to break that for something it
should be these lipsticks they are
amazeballs
so the
pop of cherry I am wearing this one on
my lips right now I also have neon red
mixed in it as well though it's I have
neon red in the center of my lips which
is this one with pop of cherry on the
outer rim just kind of mixed around to
combine one lip color and then let's see
coral crush they're pretty similar it's
funny because when I got these it's like
a really pretty coral my sister was like
these are all the exact same colors
they're all the same pinks and same
corals and I was like how dare you
they're all so different like you know
how it is when you're a makeup junkie I
got hot plum which is this beautiful
coral color and I'm nots watching these
because literally what you see right
here is what you get like it's the exact
same color on the hand as it is in the
tube so I mean that's why they're called
the vivid collection because they are
vivid I got pink pop this one is kind of
dingy my nephew got a hold of it who's
one years old fun stuff right
okay vivid Rose looks like this so
pretty I actually think the Rose was
maybe the first one I got I don't know
I'm all over the place
oh I got two pink pop maybe this was
supposed seed my sister's I think that
was supposed to manage with her snakes
I got her hooked on them too though and
then shocking Coral
absolutely love shocking coral this is
my favorite one out of all of them is
shockingly coral it is amazing okay I'm
getting hot whoo and I got two more
lipsticks by Rimmel and I was actually
surprised to see how much these were
because um most you know drugstore
lipsticks are you know like in-between
maybe like five to seven dollars and
then these were like nine so I was like
oh hello but honestly I smelt them and I
was like I can't take it I have to have
them it reminds me of my grandma's Mary
Kay lipstick from when I was a little
girl oh my god it smells so good okay so
this one right here is pink chick and
looks like that I just love it because I
don't one thing that turns me away from
drugstore lip products is when they have
that frost in them I think that when it
goes in the lips
and it makes it look cheap so when I
can't find drugstore lipsticks that
aren't frosty I'm like obsessed and then
this one right here is nude delight I
really like this because it's more like
a brown nude and not like a wipe out
your mouth nude so that's really nice
especially if you want to put like a
light babydoll pink gloss on top good
stuff okay and then I got a Milani baked
blush I've heard so much about these
blushes from girls on YouTube I mean I
feel like any time I ever see a video
they're talking about the Milani baked
blush is so I figured I would try it out
I just got this one a couple days ago I
haven't even opened it it's been hard
but I try not to use these products that
much because I want to show them to you
first so I still have that excitement
before I use them so this is in Luminess
oh and this is the baked powder blush I
thought that this was the prettiest one
because it looks like sheer with a
little bit of peach in it so it just
looks like this maybe I should open it
for you guys the packaging is kind of
flimsy that scares me
oh hello there's a little brush
underneath I'll go to your hog that's
cute
let's see the pigmentation oh it's nice
okay so that's what the blush looks like
love
way to go Milani another butter gloss by
next because you know I'm obsessed this
is maple blondie I love the color it's
like a peachy bubblegum that's it it's a
peachy bubblegum it is so pretty so I
saw that it smells like mine and then I
got a drugstore foundation which is
really huge for me because I'm obsessed
with my L'Oreal Lumi I got the Revlon 24
hour Colorstay whipped foundation now I
actually heard about this from Nicole
Guerrero I hope I'm saying her name
right she's here on YouTube so many of
you guys have left me comments asking me
if we're friends because apparently we
live near each other and I've heard her
name so much from people saying that
they think that we have similar styles
and stuff so I found her on YouTube a
little while ago and she's so sweet and
I saw her talking about this Revlon
Colorstay in a video and for some reason
I just trusted her opinion and I was
like okay and so when I saw this I was
like oh yeah that girl said that this
good so I got it my color is in 321
golden and I absolutely love love love
this it's amazing I'm wearing it right
now it doesn't settle in fine lines and
when I look in the mirror 10 hours after
it's been on I'm like oh my gosh this
looks the same if not better so this
isn't awesome awesome foundations Thank
You Nicole
Sephora okay so this is on its package
because I couldn't help it I use it this
is a josie maran argan illuminizer I'm
obsessed with josie maran if you don't
watch my videos all the time you
wouldn't know but I'm obsessed with her
products I feel like she can do no wrong
and when I saw that she had a
highlighter I was like okay stop right
now this is too much I'm gonna put a
little bit on my hands and I've used
this mixing it in with my foundation and
I've also used it just to highlight the
top of the cheekbones and it is so
beautiful you can see on my wrist it's
not too gold and it's not too pink like
it's just right in between and that
perfect spot where it would just be a
gorgeous highlighter on anyone I'll take
like a whole pump and mix it in with my
foundation and it just makes you glow it
doesn't look shimmery or sparkly it's
just a beautiful warm glow it's amazing
amazing I just want to drench my whole
body in it okay and then I got the
benefit fake up concealer this um I only
used once because like I said I'm trying
to hold back I'm so excited though and
right first saw this I thought okay it's
a gimmick like what is that moisturizing
stick around the outer edge like you can
see the only color is in the center of
the actual concealer umm but it's
supposed to be creaseless and not settle
in anything and it feels extremely
moisturizing when you put on your eyes
and the moment I put it on I was like
okay this is gonna settle like you can
feel it so thick and I'm like this is
going to go right into my lines but it
didn't then I put it on and I walked on
the house like thirty minutes and I
looked in the mirror later and it looks
the exact same
and I was like okay yes please so I
think it only had three shades like
light medium dark
I got mine and light because I'm light
right now you know the Chicago people
know and then I got a tart blush this is
my first tart blush this is the
Amazonian clay blush I have been
interested in these for so long and even
though I'm a makeup artist
it takes so much for me to spend $30 on
a blush it's like Oh $30 but I did it I
really really wanted it and I figured
that I would buy these things and then
help you guys out I'll let you know
what's worth and what's not worth it so
I got the color blissful it looks like
this it's this corley rosy pinky shade I
absolutely love it you can see it looks
like right there hello middle finger
okay let me swatch it okay so you can
see what it looks like right there it's
just like a nice Coralie color I like it
because I wanted something that's like a
general blush I can wear all the time if
I'm going to spend the money this is so
random but I got Girl Meets pearl by
benefit which is there um face primer
that has a shimmer in it now this is
weird that I got this I I think it's
weird because it is so old and it's been
out for years and I don't know why when
I was standing there looking at benefit
I was just like I need it I only tried
it once and I did like it um you know
I'm not the biggest believer in primers
when it comes to primers it has to be
like in a mill using primer for me to
like it so I didn't get it for the
priming power I got it for the globe my
last thing from benefit is the they're
real mascara then I got the Urban Decay
Naked basics palette I have heard so
much hype about this I went in I saw an
Ulta and I was like pooh-poohing it I
was like oh that's so basic this is
unnecessary I don't need it but then I
kept going back and back and I was like
okay okay I kind of liked it and
honestly this Venus shade is what sold
me on it this highlight color is so
pigmented and glorious that I was like
okay I have to get it because that shade
then i got the Stila eyeshadow in kitten
if you guys haven't heard of the shadow
is an award-winning highlighter shadow
it is like smooth as butter is
absolutely gorgeous all over the lid you
can use it as a highlighter you use as a
highlighter on the brows to sculpt the
face I mean it is just like the most
glorious bright highlighter I got the
hard candy highlighter and T key so many
of you guys technically a big bronzer
but so many of you guys told me that I
need this because I was talking about
how I'm so sick of my highlighters and
using the same ones for years and you
guys all said hard candy
you know the baked bronzer antiquey so
me and my sister made a special trip to
Walmart because I never go to long so we
made a special trip just to go and get
this and oh my gosh even the camera is
beautiful so we went there and I got it
I used it once I loved it
the next day her little boy who's almost
2 years old grabbed it out of my makeup
bag and just threw it like a baseball
and it just shot her down the wood floor
and I was like oh and even though it's
not even ten dollars I was like oh my
god you just did that so my sister and
her husband Joe be back to Walmart and
bought it for me as like I'm sorry that
my little boy threw your bronzer like a
baseball I went to Mac this is not all
Mac products so this is going to be more
high-end stuff that I got at like Mac
and Nordstrom
so first of all this is a really really
really big deal to me because I have
been wanting this for a really long time
and where I live Giorgio Armani
cosmetics is nowhere around me like
nowhere I think the closest one is like
five hours away so I had to go and get
this I've been wanting a luminous silk
foundation by Giorgio Armani forever so
I went there and I got this foundation
finally yes it was expensive it's the
most expensive foundation I've ever had
it was $60 for this bottle which is like
oh my god I am color 5.75 I love this I
only fully use on my whole face once but
it gives such a beautiful dewy glow but
it's not to do it you don't look wet
it's just
amazing next I went over to Bobby Brown
well I don't know what's happening to me
Bobby Brown really like it just happened
I got the shimmer compact in bronze I
could not make up my mind as to which
color I wanted I really really liked
bronze on the cheeks because i do not
use shimmery bronzer ever to have to
like contour my face or as a general
bronzer it's always max i think it looks
yeah if it's shimmery it just looks
muddy so I like bronze shimmer to use
almost as a blush or just a light sweep
over my blush in the summertime just to
give a nice bronze so this is the shade
with all everything mixed together if
you have a shimmer Burke in general by
Bobbi Brown and it's one of them that
you just love and can't get enough of
tell me which one it is because I have
bronze and I'm gonna try it and make
sure that I love it but if there is one
that you're like oh my god that girl
should have gotten bronze she should
have gotten this one like please let me
know in the comments below if you have
one because I know they're like the most
popular thing that Bobbi Brown has so I
would love to know which ones you guys
own and can't get enough of because you
know I love my highlights I got one more
thing from Bobbi Brown and that was a
lipstick one of my subscribers talked to
me about this I think on Instagram I
forgot what picture was what
conversation was happening and if you
were the one to recommend thank you so
much I love this color it's called
bikini pink and someone was like oh you
know try this it's like a cream Cup but
matte and you guys were right on the
money because it is super pigmented and
it's got a little bit of Sheen but it's
not creamy creamy like cream cup is and
I just oh hello Shh but I just love this
color I love love love this I can't get
enough of these baby Pink's another
really high-end item and this is from
recommendations of you guys on my lasts
my video two videos ago where I told you
guys I needed help with new highlighters
the most popular comment that I got with
you guys recommending the dior shimmer
powder and amber diamond and I have
never owned a Dior anything in my life
I have the mascara once but that was it
like I I just don't treat myself to high
high-end products like Giorgio Armani
and Dior like this is this is new for me
I'm usually very like hey that's
unnecessary
okay let's see it's right there yeah you
can see it absolutely beautiful I love
this and then I went to Anastacio and
got some stuff for the brows I got to
eyebrow pencils I got one in I put them
in the same box just because I was
traveling but I got one in soft brown
and one in medium ash so they're just
her little brow pencils I really really
like them I've been using soft brown to
fill in my brows if you can't tell I
have not been filling them in as much I
am making them much more subtle I'm over
the super thick brows some of you are
going to be thinking God himself
for that I got the Anastasia clear brow
gel there's nothing special it's just a
clear brow gel just looks like that I've
heard that it's like the best in
cosmetics that your brows do not move so
let's hope that that is true
I got amazing cosmetics concealer it is
itty-bitty it is only this big and this
thing cost me $28 it was either this one
or one that was like double the size for
40 something but I got this because I
figured I would try it out oh my gosh
hello this is amazing they say if you're
using the right amount that it will not
crease at all and I have not experienced
creasing so far so I am loving this a
couple more things I got a blaze from
Mac it was in that collection that just
came out and I can't even remember the
name and I don't really even want to
talk about it so it's just this Coralie
color looks like so I love love coral
colors for the eyes even if you're not
going to put it all over just dip it a
little fluffy brush in it and buff it
out a little bit and I just love the
color that it gives the eyes just brings
a warmth and then I got a Mac mineralize
lipstick this is in Lux natural it's a
nude it is a nude nude let me try to
pull this off right here whoo look at me
go
really I like these because it's a
magnet so when it goes down it like
snaps on alright you can see that Lux
naturelle it's just a new lipstick I
like it um I don't have tons of really
new lipsticks I have more like pink new
lipstick so I thought that was nice
shape the future extra dimension skin
finish by Mac looks like this it's just
a highlighter I really like this part
over here because it's like a rosy amber
color and this part is like a gold color
so if you mix it together it is a
gorgeous blush absolute gorgeous or you
can just use this side as a highlighter
so yeah beautiful shape the future I'm
sure you guys can still find these
around I got them like a week and a half
two weeks ago and then I got an extra
dimension blush at dusk um this one
looks like so it's just a nice pinky
color these go on really sheer so if
you're a person who is afraid of really
pigments and blushes pigmented blushes
this is going to be kind of yours so it
just looks like this it's on my wrist
you can see how sheer it is but it's
beautiful it looks so natural on the
cheeks I actually got to go to my old
store that I used to work out in Chicago
at Woodfield Mall to buy these things oh
okay a couple more things I actually
ordered these online and they were here
waiting for me at my house like good
little girls I got the mary lou manizer
by the balm and I got the betty
loumanizer my mom um this is a
highlighter this is a bronzer both super
shimmery I own this one but when I
received it from hot look forever ago or
hautelook however you say it um it was
completely shattered so I have never
really gotten to thoroughly enjoy it so
it just looks like this I talked about
this so much I use it all the time
absolutely beautiful pigmented
highlighter um hello
look you see it you know what my swatch
is suck and the lighting sucks but
that's okay because the lighting is
going to change very soon so this is the
bronzer once again I said how I really
like bronzer with shimmer in it for the
cheekbones and the summertime I do not
use this kind of bronzer all over the
face and up on the forehead you're going
to be a hot mess but if you like to be a
hot mess you do your thing no judgement
looks like that very golden so this is
something that I would use just lightly
dusting over a blush just to give more
of a bronze glow I got the urban decay
chill makeup setting spray I really
wanted to get the do me spray which is
de W but apparently they stopped making
it and I was really sad but they told me
that this is similar so I don't know if
that's true or they were just trying to
sell me but yeah it actually gives like
a gelling feeling to the skin it feels
amazing um it's just a makeup setting
spray it's cooling and hydrating paraben
free temperature control technology it's
just supposed to make the makeup set
last all day I also got um model in a
bottle as well and that is a setting
spray but that's already in my makeup
kit so that's not here in the video but
I got that too anyways okay so then a
couple more things I got these online I
ordered a couple of stuff couple of
things from Leigh cosmetic dot-com um I
think that's the name I'll put the link
below they have such a great selection
of OCC lip tars the obsessive compulsive
cosmetics and if you have not heard of
lip tars please remove the rock that you
are living under because these things
are the bomb okay that's really cheesy
that I just said the bomb but these
things are amazing I love them
especially if you're a makeup artist and
you're working on other people and
yourself
these are awesome to have in your kit
because they're made to mix with other
lip colors to design your own absolutely
amazing and if you don't mix them with
something else
they're not going to last beautifully
for more than like 30 or 45 minutes
they'll kind of get like I don't know
anyways they smell like peppermint
they're so smooth and they just they're
beautiful so this is hush right here
this is momento and as you can see these
aren't all colors I and personally
obsessed with but I got them for my kit
this is narcissus haha this is queen
okay I'm sorry but part of me had to get
it because of the name okay and this is
pretty boy oh pretty boy it's like my
husband oh god he's gonna hate me and
this is a baddie I think this is just a
pitch black and then I got a Z palette
and this is the pro sighs it's just
leopard all around and you can see
through it and put your magnetic eyes
shadows in it inside I actually have
makeup geek eyeshadows they're still in
their packaging didn't want to take them
out so I could show you
I got brown sugar cocoa bear bling and
creme Brule so creme brulee Bing let's
see cocoa bear and brown sugar I know
you can really see in the packaging but
honestly you're just gonna have to live
with it because I need to take them out
on my own time I'm sure I will use them
in videos um you guys know who makeup
geek is it's a woman who started here on
YouTube I think her name is Marlena
makeup geek I think it's just makeup
geek is her YouTube channel so sweet she
used to work at Mac she got the
opportunity to design her own makeup
line and I've heard such great things
about it so I figured hey I need to help
a sister out and go buy some of her
things and if I love it I will
definitely be buying more the prices are
perfect it's like six dollars an
eyeshadow love and I've heard a lot of
people say that they're even better than
Mac so I'm all about that okay and then
two more things this is from Lake
cosmetic it well as well this is the
graftobian I love graftobian this is the
blush palette and the warm looks like
this so you have all different ranges of
color in the warm
corely brownish pink family so I got
this specifically for my makeup kit
that's where he's going to go live so
that I have nice blushes just more to
add to that kit for different faces
different colors other than just myself
and then I got one more thing and this
is the setting powder by graftobian and
this is in neutral so I have the
graftobian HD cream foundations in my
freelance kit so I thought I would get
the powder to go with as well so I just
got a neutral one because most of these
you can make it work so I already have
powders but I really wanted to get these
because they're beautiful on camera also
got all these candles back here from
Bath and Body Works I got six of them if
you don't follow me on Instagram I
posted a picture of all of them show you
guys which ones I got of course you guys
can always see which ones are your
favorite I got them during the two 4/20
deal and then I had a coupon code and
free shipping alright you guys so that
is everything that I got in the last
month of my life a few of these things I
ordered before I left for Chicago but
now I hope that you are not overwhelmed
and you really enjoyed this video and
all the new things that I got obviously
you're going to be seen using a lot
different products on my upcoming video
since I went so crazy now it's time for
me to close up my wallet and go cry in
the corner so I will see you guys soon I
love you Emma bye
