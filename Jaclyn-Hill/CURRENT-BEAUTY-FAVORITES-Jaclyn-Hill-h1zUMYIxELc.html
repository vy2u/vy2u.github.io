somebody cut me up this kind of smells
like why am I sitting so low there's so
much headspace about me right now I'm
like this brother is really good y'all
in the world I got hey guys welcome back
to my channel I don't even know how to
start off this video and what to say in
my intro because it's an excessive
cliche but I have missed you guys so
much I have not filmed in so long I
don't even feel like I'm a youtuber
anymore like I feel like I'm just like
an Instagram or snapchat er I don't know
loser who is just for those of you who
don't know my husband and I just moved
and this is our new place we relocated
it has been crazy I forgot how much work
it is to move even though this is like
either the fifth or six moves it John
and I have made in the past eight years
I think it's the sixth we're going to
Boston Chicago mom so holy crap this is
the seventh move Wow seven - okay well
there you have it so yeah we're done for
a while hoping that we can actually live
here now that we are homeowners for a
very long time and just settle down and
actually enjoy home and not move again
for a while but I forgot how much work
it is like just so many little things
you know I just like times like the
plumbing and like the electrical like
there's just been so many things that
have gone wrong like it always is when
you move you're like oh why am i Wi-Fi
not working got a call a guy you're like
oh my pipe burst got a call plumber like
oh why aren't be vice turning on got a
call an electrician you know there's
like so many little loose end but it's
starting to feel a little bit more like
home everyday but we still have people
here constantly all day long like that's
why I'm building this late because it is
right now 6:40 at night and I would
simply film earlier in the day but
there's been people here all day long
like we have like contractors
electricians and plumbers and painters
still in here all the time so me and
John have not even had one day of just
us being alone yeah I know why I'm
babbling and telling you guys all about
this item
but install a long and I really miss you
so hopefully you're cool with this setup
right now this is John eyes bedroom it's
not done but it is done I will probably
show you guys a little bit more cuz I
know it that's the most requests to do
right now is a furnished house tour but
it is not fully furnished about half way
first right now but hey we got a bed
we got a bench we got a rug we got some
art so we go so for today's video I'm
going to be doing at my current favorite
I couldn't name this like my August
favorites or my July favorites being
placed too early to be August and too
late to be July at the middle of the
month so like let's just call my current
favorites because it's just random stuff
and it's actually all beauty related I
thought about like pulling in some other
random neighbors because I have some
other end there it's just removing
recently like Power Bars I've been
eating and smoothies that I've been
making and just like random stuff that
like comes like the home and home decor
but I was like no let's just keep it
beauty so let's just jump in to the
favorite vibe for myself a little glass
at Pinot hey I'm just actually my first
glass and that was like this sorta four
sips oh no I'm not drunk
it goes come in every video is she drunk
I'm like so I am little girl in I got
lip products I even have some drugstore
products today oh my god oh ones I'm not
gonna try to be bad a movie I'm gonna
actually bring it in for the real thing
sucker Wisconsin video I'm not going to
make it cheesy by saying it this is one
of my favorites because obviously it is
you guys already know that alright
seriously want to take a moment to truly
say thank you for all the love on my
palate with morphe you guys have
absolutely no idea how much love I feel
from you every single day on this
palette I have never had a collaboration
or products in my life where I've had
such an overwhelming amount of love and
posts just constantly coming towards me
like even when I leave the house when I
go to the grocery store I get stopped by
my subscribers just being like
Jacqueline where your palette right now
like thank you for creating this every
single time I get emotional I'm just
like I stand there shop if you like
sometimes when I meet my subscribers I
walk away I'm like what must they think
of me because in that mode stand there
like I agree Mother's Day I think I just
want to cry giggle there goes my kitchen
so avoid but I just I'm just so touched
by you guys and just so thankful for all
the love and the support and the fact
that it sold out so quickly in 40
minutes and then the read
was gone and just like a couple of
minutes like I just never experienced
this kind of love and excitement and at
first when this palette was about to
launch and we sent it out to it a couple
hundred people in PR and there were
people who made some nasty video is
about its being like this isn't good
like just talking badly about it
it like got me like shift to the core I
was like hope it all the second-guessing
my cell phones because they're not heard
about they're not like I was so worried
about what the consumers we're going to
think about what you guys were going to
say because people can make videos all
they want like people can give their
opinions people can be hateful people
can be nice whatever they want to do
that people can make videos all they
want but at the end of the day it's not
the people who receive it for free and
if people on PR who I really care about
their opinion it is my subscribers
because this palette is for you and
everything I do one here is for you so
now that one hundred and hundred and
hundred thousands of people own this
palette all I'm seeing now is positivity
towards it and so when people just tell
me how much they actually love it like
you have no idea what a weight has been
just lifted off of my chest I am just so
thankful like I can't tell you guys I
really cannot put into words how think I
am that you have loved something I put
so much work and effort into like oh I
just feel like the happiest girl in the
world I think I'm floating on air and
it's because of you and your left
towards pallet so that's going to say a
true thank you from the bottom of my
heart and I know that Linda from morphe
feels the exact same way I'm gonna
extend that from her as well
I don't experiment first that I've not
been able to put it down for the past so
I would say two months at this point and
they are the Kylie cosmetics out there
tending the clubs they don't say on the
actual packaging but they're her loose
powder highlights and the thing I love
well think about the most about these
it's a blinding highlight that it gives
you but I also love that it's such a
reasonable price point and believe it's
like twelve or thirteen dollars for
these when I got online and looked just
so amazing because the tiniest dent is
positive on both the longest way they
remind me a lot up on the makeup forever
starlet cars I was like dying over but
like look at this you see how lightly I
touch that and the kind of color payoff
that you get this is the shade Santorini
and like I don't know if you can let
truly see on camera just how the
lightening that color is I have it on my
cheek right now and of course I might
say a champagne pop I know I'm annoying
but I make the most every single hair
ever apply champagne pops because I love
the undertone of champagne pop and the
second one is in the shade Fiji so
Santorini is definitely more for those
who are really fair and as Fiji has a
little bit more of like a golden
bronzy undertone but not super bold
arrazi like just a little bit so you
don't have to be dark to where you have
to have a little bit of color like right
now I'm a little bit too fair for it I
am like white right now like I have not
put on with a matte foundation but I've
already put on a Mac foundation I would
be like an NC 15 or like an NW 10 right
now but I am very very pale I do wish
that it came in a different packaging
even though I couldn't see is one
prymaat
I can't think of a packaging that would
be more ideal for this but it's super
duper messy like as you can see right
here because you basically get a
highlight all over you but you know what
I'm not complaining as you can fellas
like jazz I'll fake it and guarantee you
the first time you ever try these
you'll be like whoa too much you know
how to like wipe some away or like data
off of the Beauty Blender because it is
so intense like you have to use the
tiniest amount and that's why I think as
a price is so amazing for these if I
can't imagine if I use this every single
day it would posit me over a year to go
through it like it is the tiniest bit
goes a long way make up forever blushes
it just came out they sent these to me
in PR and I just put them in an empty Z
palette or any magnetic palette would do
I love that these formulas I do like
what are one of the things that like
really overlooked in the industry it's
all about like bronzer contour and
highlight right now but like I can't go
without blush I really can not like it's
such a rare occasion that I don't put
blush on when I do my makeup I have to
polish on my favorite types of colors I
like eg Coralie oranges and then like
kind of mommy kind of wet Kalish
undertones
um this right here which is like a hot
coral it's called sea make up rubber
always makes their number so Paola gated
it's b40 - I'll list in the bottom bar
down below like my favorites that was
b40 - and then this one is B 3:08 those
astute I use the most
but then I love this like really neutral
it's got her like a pinkish undertone
kind of like Bobby it's really great and
this is s
300 and this will be the most universal
blush so I could find two different skin
tones this is West you can put on with
any eye color with Marc Jacobs bronzer
on what mine denying coconut for those
coconut roller uh also good first life
of the white packaging because if you
know me the guys look anything white and
silver it's just my love I also love
white and gold but white in jewelry even
more and this is the 104 fantastic Omega
bronzer coconut perfect and limited
edition so I hope this is still
available um I did purchase it myself I
think they also sent me one too I think
they gave it away but I did buy this
just like I would say six weeks ago more
so maybe from Sephora um but it is just
such a beautiful beautiful color goes on
so smooth so blendable it's a really
neutral color but I want to tell you
guys about it like it really is some
trouble work for some a different skin
tones I can wear them at our house there
I am and then also when I get really tan
I can still wear them this is an oldie
but a goodie bag talk about it because I
have been so obsessed recently like I
can't stop using it every time I do my
makeup I have to use this and it's been
a while stepping like that committed to
this palette right here it's a Kat Von D
shade + light contour palette as you can
see I'm hi yes it's been you then move
the service of smoothest powder ever and
they're so pigmented and just natural
with like they're not shiny but like
they just have such a natural feel Sens
they just go on like chronic lateness
this contour color right here I think is
my favorite contour color ever like I
love mac shade stir which is like such a
beautiful contour shade but I think this
one blend out better and I use this
almost every Sunday and use like a tiny
brush every time I've done my makeup
recently I just like a little small
brush and I'll just take it kind of just
right there in light of my contour so I
was kind of right there really ever so
lightly over top of my browser just to
cut my cheekbones a little bit because
honey my diet has been it's gone down
the drain the past couple weeks is
moving my face is doing so I am
contouring to the best of my ability can
we take a minute for this palette oh my
god now I have
actually worn my makeup with this
palliate that makes sense but I have
played with this palette like just at
night and when I might go back to wash
my face just done makeup looks and then
wash it off but I haven't actually wore
it throughout the day but this is a
Sephora Pro palette and this is a neon
one I ordered like the warm one and then
this one and honestly the warm ones
didn't even I don't know I just wasn't
like yeah I'm gonna draw on two hour so
I don't know that's a pretty palette but
not necessary whereas this one like
inspire me on different level but this
is just so beautiful the pigmentation is
out of this world pigmented and they are
so bilenda before being so bright and so
like let me just do a little like let me
swatch someone for you right here like
honey that's a lot for barely touching
it like that like that's a lot good
swatch like a few random and you know
that like when it comes to makeup I'm a
basic bitch alright I just love my warm
tone I do like the same look basically
every day which is kind of I'm wearing
right now I just love warm they look
Brown they look champagne those gold but
this palette like had really inspired me
to get outside my comfort zone
the only thing is like when I do like
crazy makeup I said I can't wear any
outfits that I want to wear that makes
sense that's the only thing that stops
me like Ron used to work at Mac I would
do just like the craziest most vibrant
makeup with bold lips just like so over
the top but it's because I'm going to
work at Mac and I was always wearing all
black without my uniform but now I was
like an everyday person like I don't
want to wear all black all the time and
I have such a hard time like if I'm
going to wear with a rainbow color
makeup look I'm like I think my clothes
are so limited you know I'm not going to
prom with a floral shirt like a rainbow
colored smokey eye ear I'm saying so I
don't know what yet the only thing that
really stops me from wearing like
beautiful colors on a daily basis but
you just got my comfort zone it just
make it happen and so on a denim jacket
I guess because I really really really
love these bright shades in this palette
I had a drugstore highlighter that I
absolutely love I think this is the best
drugstore highlighter that I have ever
used now granted I know that's like the
precious petal that thing is called by
wet and wild I think I only use it once
and it was a while ago like it was when
I first got my hands on it was months
and months
to go so I don't really know which one
is better I don't know anybody has done
like a compares how the two maybe I
should do a compare another two to three
times better but this is a Maybelline
master chrome metallic highlighter in
the shade molten gold it is just like
it's gorgeous but this is not good do
for like a Mac whisper of skills or like
a Nastasia so Hollywood just like that
really gorgeous like liquid metal
looking gold highlight it is absolutely
gorgeous
rock on Maybelline for doing this it's a
so bomb a brand that was going my
favorite brands in the drugstore mainly
in L'Oreal I love them both so much and
this highlight is just incredible so a
snapchat is an order that I place with
flutter lashes a couple of days ago and
I ordered 100 pairs of my favorite
lashes which are the ones I'm wearing
right now and I had some people ask me
what lashes they were and I did tell you
back on snapchat but a lot of people I
don't think heard what I said and they
are the intoxicating lashes by water and
they are my favorite lashes ever as you
can see they are on the dramatic side
they are not like everyday lashes for an
everyday girl probably but they are for
me I love them so much they're so
comfortable they're so fluffy they're
long so it's the perfect amount of
thickness I have a lot of lip products
let's just delicious go in the first
ones are from a drugstore and they are
by a brand called mua makeup academy i
got these just at my local CVS like two
months ago and in my drugstore haul but
i know that everyone is still asking for
my drugstore first impression i don't
need to do it this point i pulled so
many products out of the box and tried
them though my ads going to be a trend
appropriate impression i'm guys have
sent me on like a list of drugstore
products of stuff that you like it's up
to new as stuff if you want to know if
it's good and I can run out and buy that
and actually do like it's updated
drugstore worst impressions because that
would be more fun for me because at this
point I've tried so much of it but I'm
like I don't even know if I have enough
but anyways these are both news
obviously this top one right here is
very pale this is in the shade 1:04 baby
pink and the bottom one I wear more
often and this is 1:08 nude but I really
like these because they are very
pigmented glosses they're almost like a
wannabe Anastasio gloss so you can see
right here like baby pink is very very
pale I've never actually worn it alone
overtop of nude where this one is the
one I wear quite often this one is like
very very pigmented the only thing I
don't like about it is that it can kind
of break up on my lips after maybe like
20-30 minutes kind of break up breaks up
and doesn't look that great like
longevity like long wear but it looks
really good at first but you kind of
have to keep an eye on it and keep
touching it up I'm a poet I get a
Nastasia or a Kylie gloss that is a
super pigmented and very like glossy
like this one you don't want to touch it
up that often but this one kind of do
but hey it's okay because it's so
inexpensive and the color is really
really beautiful another drugstore glass
that I love this l'oreal infallible
eight hour pro block in the shade what
she says you're kidding
you are there's no shade name on this
there's literally no shading it's like
this really beautiful like pink with
gold shimmer in it and it's very sheer
which I love cuz if you think put it on
your lips with nothing else on and it
just have like this really beautiful
just kind of like glisten with a little
tiny flecks of gold but it's not
glittery and it doesn't look cheap like
it looks really really pretty but I
don't have a name like it doesn't say
anywhere on this entire tube if you guys
know like how I can locate the name of
this but please let me know because this
is strange that there's no name on this
another drugstore product is this
Milania lipstick and this is in the
shade matte innocence and it's such a
pretty matte color Milani lipstick are
one of my favorite drugstore lipsticks
it's so nice but honestly I have five
hundred the six that looks just like
this so I just love that it's from the
drugstore and it's inexpensive and this
is where my favorite looks with formulas
this and there's another one Maybelline
those are my two favorite lipstick from
the drugstore they don't break up on me
they're not like way too sheer or like
way too dry okay so for non-drug throw
lip products this is the charlotte
tilbury ellipse cheek reshape and resize
lip liner in the shade iconic news so
it's just a lip liner but it's like a
very like boozy name for a lip liner
it's so creamy but it's not too creamy
because I don't like a liner that's too
creamy or too dry because if it's too
dry it's hard to put on it kind of balls
up and if it's too creamy if you try to
over line even the slightest bit if
there it's obvious because like the
light catches it and like lets you know
you're a liar
that you're over lining your lips and it
doesn't look natural so it means that
they just the perfect mats out being too
dry I love this one it's so beautiful
and the shade is like it's called iconic
nude and it truly is like it's an iconic
new shade it's like the perfect color of
nude I also have another shade by her I
can't be what it's called but having
over pinkie in a tone that one's really
nice too but this is the one that I use
like every single time I do a nude lip
this is the shade that I line my lips
with first because it's just perfect I
have been loving as davia gloss recently
I have liked that Kylie highlighter all
over and breathing because it's built
outside a little container so it's like
all over the place and I just mopped the
floors but this is the nside you look
lost in the shade toffee I love Attis
Abhiyan glasses I think they're so
beautiful they are very thick and very
pigmented but the shade is so pretty
subtle brownish kind of Mavi undertone
like a little bit but it's not too round
I don't like shades are too Brown
remember writing to be so against any
matte Brown in it let's only do like
nudie pinks I would never do with moody
brown but now I am really incident
especially glosses and I think that it's
so pretty my obsession with this
applause is so beyond real and yes it's
expensive it's Dior oh my gosh it is
like worth every penny to me I put on
over every lipstick I put on all by
itself just over bare lips like I don't
care what the occasion is like this
gloss is just so beautiful it's lip
Maximizer collagen active Dior Addict
gloss in 0:01 so basically have no shade
and it's like very minty and like Ryan
swatch it like you're not going to be
able see it there's no color in it
whatsoever it's just so galaki make sure
let's look so wet and juicy and like I'm
all about that light but I just love a
wet looking lip so I'll run any lipstick
I'll put this over top and it's just
like Oh Kylie cosmetics matte liquid
lipsticks in the shade Kristin yes god I
am so obsessed with this color you have
no idea it's not I'm wearing my lips
right now I at this moment I'm wearing
Calabasas by jeffree star cosmetics but
Kristin oh my gosh I'm
is this bottle like isn't showing any
emptiness things I won this now minimum
10 to 15 times in the past couple months
mm innamal like it is such a beautiful
color like it's just such an everyday
pop of color for the list like it's not
too red it's not too raspberry it's not
2 cherries not too burgundy like it's
just so flattering and I see on so many
different skin tones I'm a different eye
color and they just look on everybody
like I love it so much I laughing at me
if you have the Too Faced melted latex
liquid high shine lipstick oh my
goodness
this formula is incredible and I feel
like to face is the only brand I really
know who has done this formula so far
and I am ready for more like I want more
shapes
I want more brands a lot more news I
want it all smell good the pigmentation
is unlike any other like oh my gosh so
it's not a matte
it is a gloss but it's not like I don't
know how to explain it liquid latex was
the perfect name for because it is like
huge minted like pigmented and it has a
shine to it as you can see but it's not
as glossy as I see at asad via one it's
not as glossy as all the others is so
sick though and it lasts for so long it
doesn't say anything about one lastly
we're on it but I last for a long time
on me and this shade right here is
peekaboo which been a really pretty
pinky kind of nude there are three
shades I love and I can't find the other
two before in the video I like running
around looking but honestly this this
house is there's a lot that's still not
like place properly but I wear peekaboo
a lot or or top of the iconic nude by
Charlotte Tilbury lip liner to kind of
balance it out so it's not too pinky
laughs amount nice I have a fashion
piece and this is a denim jacket that I
just got from Zara a week and a half ago
I would say and I'm always being asked
where I get my denim jacket and I will
be honest I have I think over 15 maybe
20 denim jackets because I can love them
so much as anytime I see one no matter
where it's from I pick it off because I
just think that very easiest way to make
anything look like it's dressed up
without wear leggings and just a v-neck
outside denim jacket with some
earrings and it looks like I kind of
tried I love how Rick's this one is I
think it's so cute like all the details
on the side and it is from Zara so it is
a reasonably priced and I just think
it's so cute
and where it hits on the body like it's
kind of hard to show you guys I'm
sitting here on the floor right now but
where it's on the body like it's cropped
right here it's not a high crop but it's
not like too low it I love where it hits
so if you're wearing like black denim
it's going to hit you right at the top
of your jeans which I love are you guys
so that is it for this video I hope that
you enjoy my current favorites and I
apologize if there was any quick
technical difficulties if the sound
wasn't right or focused or just anything
like that like I said this is not my
permanent setup I'm just sitting on the
floor right now with a little tripod and
to life in my viewfinder it's all the
way over in that corner I don't have an
extension cord so I never looked at
myself the entire kind of just like
engaged into the camera so hopefully I'm
in focus but I flip it uploading either
way um I know a lot of you guys are
really wanting to see more tutorials
using my palette morphine absolutely I
will be doing that for you guys are you
kidding me of course the only reason I
haven't it's just because ahead of the
filming videos but now that I am back in
action and I have my camera I have my
light I will be filming a tutorial so
using my pal I said figure out what
tutorials to build the very funny also
