channel for today's video I already know
what you're thinking okay they're gonna
hook the bigger the hoe and you know
what I gotta say I'm holding up today I
was kind of a holy mood don't hate the
player hate the game for today's video
I'm going to be doing at my current
Beauty favorite current beauty products
I don't know listen we're going to be
talking all things beauty I have so many
amazing products sitting in front me
right now it's like hard like to have a
little orgasm every time I look over -
laughing oh yes I have not done a
favorites video and I don't even know
how many months it's sinful it's
completely wrong I understand these
words go ahead and unsubscribe give me a
thumbs down right now because I totally
deserve it you guys like what's the
though it has been way too long seconds
on a favorite video so the past week or
so I've been pulling all these products
I've been using recently and I'm like
this is too big to be just like an April
favorites it needs to be like a current
favorites video because these are not
things I've just been loving from the
one that April is open seven eleven for
the past two to three months that I have
been using constantly not something that
I only tried once or twice but stuff has
been consistently using it absolutely a
love thing I have so many lip products
okay like Ethan lon so excited to do
this video because you're like one of my
favorite videos to film I get so happy
when I sold favorite videos is committed
to sit here and just genuinely talk
about products that I love and it's like
what better than that getting to talk
about things that you love putting on
your paint and your money I don't know
where to start this is like a little
well okay so I'm going to start off with
the lip product
you guys have so many lip products I
have been loving I don't know what
happened but I feel like the past three
months all these amazing brands had just
dropped such gorgeous amazing quality
lip products and I have distance falling
in love so the first thing I want to
talk about are these bare minerals
glosses so these are my top four that I
use all the time they basically all live
in my purse or I pull them out to my
vanity I put them back in my purse
wherever I go you will be able to find
me with me is what I'm saying as far as
the formula I would compare them to like
an Anasazi on the blog or like a Kylie
cosmetics applause in the sense that
they are a sticker block but they have a
really really beautiful shiny wet ole up
with their very pigmented they are not
sticky at all in my opinion they're
honestly like my perfect gloss like I've
always said the Marc Jacobs in my favor
block and this is crazy but I actually
think that this ah might replace it
don't kill me don't kill me by Arthur
because they might they're so amazing I
do it the way Marc Jacobs taste and
smell more but these are so beautiful
they last for so long on your lips
because they're so thick and because
they're so pigmented but they're so
comfortable I am I requested for you
guys in the back of my hand
of course a little kind of beauty guru
would I be if I didn't wash them for you
okay so my number one shade I wear all
the time which is a very pale color in
the shade groovy and it looks like this
and that is one swipe right there as you
can see is a crazy pigmented they kind
of feel like crayons honestly they don't
have like this amazing scent which is
why are the Marc Jacobs scent is the
government II sent the second one is in
the shade sugar I love this one when I
have a little bit more of a tan because
it does have a little bit more color in
it right there it's got a little bit
more of a pinky mommy undertone as
opposed to groovy is like really really
fair then the shade totally is a shade
that I wear when I'm like my absolute
panic
such a pretty nude but it does have like
that brown tint as opposed to the first
one and then the last we have the shade
sly which actually has some gold shimmer
in it but it's so beautiful and this one
is the brown it's one of the ones that I
personally wear now there are other
shades that are more Brown in it but
this is basically like the brown it's
that I will go on my skin tone but I'm
comfortable with but these four shades
like literally they live with me I'm so
obsessed like when I stop you have no
idea so makeup for ever came out with
liquid vi and they are calling this
artist liquid Max and they are so
beautiful they came out a range of
shades I have several of them right here
a ton of like beautiful pinky neutrals
Lobby neutrals rosy neutrals like
teaching controls just amazing I'm so
happy that all these people that are
doing the goodness are not coming out
with a lot of neutral shades because I'm
just like finally I get first everyone's
coming out in bright colors and dark
color and I was like where are my nose
they're nice and thin but they're not
watery they're not too sick they're not
Lucy they're just such an ideal liquid
lipstick formula it comes out like a
very standard applicator
I'll show you this color this is the
color I go wearing constantly recently
this isn't a shade
1:03 you don't make it forever they
never give us names only numbers if
you're looking for a new amazing liquid
lipstick formula I was definitely trying
to make it for everyone because I have
been loving them Netherlands where the
stick formulas really amazing right now
are the MAC Cosmetics with lipsticks are
they actually calling these some retro
max liquid lips
I'm at these are beautiful I don't have
a favorite color
we've only worn maybe like a little more
like two or three times but I love you
guys know in general you're looking for
amazing with good lipsticks Mac's new
formula is primes it's so good alright
we're going to stick with little bit
apparently I move to that so I have worn
this so many times in the past two or
three months I would say and every
single time I have on my snapchat my
Twitter starts blowing up people asking
what this is I respond instead of real
people but I want to talk about on here
as well to warrant so much I mean you
can't see in the bottle but I would bet
this is at least half way Gong said
weren't so much and this is my Kat Von D
is called the everlasting liquid
lipstick in the shade and arrow I don't
know what took me so long to get on this
lip color it is so flippin gorgeous it
is like that cool Bobbi Brown like a
purple undertone it is so pretty I don't
know why I saw I've seen this up like on
social media so many times I'm just like
oh I would hate that I look terrible on
me and I love it I wear when I'm super
tan and I also wear our an extremely
fair and just so you know because a lot
of people don't it's hard to see like
what color I am on camera cause the
lights definitely change things a little
bit and to sort things but when I am
like fresh sheets break and I'm an NC 42
and Mac Foundation and then when I get
my absolute palest I'm like honestly an
NW 10 to NW 15 like very very fair so I
go like very drastically from like
butt-ass white like snow white milk skin
to pretty tan so I will wear this color
when I'm extremely fair and when I'm
really tan and I love it both times it's
really flattering I think it's a really
beautiful sheet
I work on a color pop ooh girl talk
about a brand that has stepped up their
game and that I have fallen in
love with and honestly begun to respect
a lot last couple of months because I
don't like to talk about people or
anything in general and life honestly
people brand products and I don't like
it like I don't care on my channel and
say I hate this part that's because I
don't know I just want to talk about the
negative um but that's why you can see
me talk about color pop a lot in the
past because the majority their product
I just didn't love what there were just
a few things here and there that I like
overall I didn't love it
just recently every single time in semi
a PR package I loved everything
everything has just gotten so much
creamier is much more pigmented just so
much more blendable with just everything
in general like their single eyeshadows
which honestly should be in my video
right now I don't have invest me with
their single eyeshadows okay the right
hand right yes the other right here
their single eyeshadows these are all
color pop shadows right here are so good
like I love the rage they have in here
so many things did come out recently and
so beyond impressed by so anyways I just
wanted to use like the overall brand a
shout out for Steph yet they're getting
so much because I'm so impressed um be
right here oh my gosh talk about like my
news heaven these are all the colour-pop
ultra satin lip which I never do that I
love so much up until recently you guys
have not tried the ultra satin lip
formula I would very much encourage you
to it is such a beautiful formulation it
is not like a liquid lip like the one
I'm wearing right now where it's totally
matte but it's not a gloss it's like a
glossy liquid let the tar do explain
like it's definitely long wearing for
sure but it's very creamy and it is just
I love it if there's one of my favorite
formulas to wear right now I think it is
so beautiful I'm going to give you guys
a little swatching party really quickly
so you can see these colors the first
one is in the shade shrimp and it looks
like that and that is one swipe love
this color it's like such a gorgeous
medium tone Mavi shade second one is
initiated naughty and I was wearing this
on my list on snapchat maybe like five
weeks ago I mixed it with bow and arrow
which bow and arrow is right here I
mixed these two together put this in the
center of my lip and then bow and arrow
all over and I had so many people
snapping and tweeting me about it so I
actually told you guys about it and I
know that there were kind of screen
shots because you guys love that lip
color and that lip combo was so pretty
we have the shaded strut which now I'm
watching I'm like oh my gosh look at how
much strut and bow and arrow are like
the exact same color right there that's
crazy
the only difference bone arrow is a full
mat by Kat Von D and strut is going to
say that a creamy sad but Wow
next we have the shade likely which
looks like a zit and it looks a lot like
Nadia except Nadi is way more pink and
likely has way more like a peachy
undertone and then last we have aquarius
which is actually a color developed by
Kathleen lights and I love it so much
it's right here I don't know how to
explain the color and compared to the
other ones but it has less peach in more
rows but its arms in the color I go to
where I just want like it's awesome
neutrals it's not too new it's not too
dark because it is just so good it
doesn't have too much peach and they
have too much Browns have too much pink
like it's just such a good neutral
Kathleen did such a good job which he
created a shade I loved it so much but
alas the product by color top is the one
that I'm wearing right now on my lips
which I came and tell you how many times
I have worn this color you guys like oh
my gosh every sometimes you see me in a
bold red lips in the past two months it
has been this color right here I am so
obsessed it's initiated little weapon by
color pop and Alexis red it is their
collaboration together oh my gosh I
can't even tell you my I first saw this
color I pull it out I was like oh oh my
god like I just I love it when brands
come out of color that are so similar
thing that you see before but they did
just a little tweaking to make it
different you know and like that I felt
about this because like is it a red is
it a coral who know there's like it's
got like this gorsek firecracker rather
than just Corley orangie undertone but
it's not orange but it's not coral but
it's not a true red it's like it's such
a gorgeous color so acquiring for summer
I love it so much as to me this is a
college you can put on which is some tan
skin
spray from like gooey setting spray rub
some Luminizer all over your body curl
your lashes and put that bold lip on and
like it'll just be like a glowing
beach hand groans gun with a bright
firecracker lip lip ah that's gonna be
I'm cutting the Omega organic all over
like don't worry you guys I know that me
doing all of these swatches and all
these neutrals can be a little confusing
and it's done talking quickly
I will in the description box below this
video link every single item and I will
put every single name of every single
products that I talked about so that
everything is like laid out for you guys
are not confusing if you are curious
about it these next two products just
totally caught me off guard by a total
surprise I just feel like this brand
doesn't really come out with stuff I'm
just like obsessed with in general and
it is by Lancome Lancome Lancome I don't
know by god they are metallic lip
glosses and they are so freakin
beautiful like the formulation is
absolute perfection and I don't be
actual naming them are because there is
no like name on the bottom of them it
just has the name of the actual product
so these are the two shades there are
several shades there were tons of shape
that came out I donated the rest of them
I only took the ones I was actually
interested in with these four shades
right here with the ten I have been
wearing a lot are these right here and
the first one is in the shade zero nine
mirror nude and it will have a pinky
under two of tone under turn undertone
and it has gold flakes in it it's kind
of hard oh my god you is so beautiful I
know the artist even is so glossy and
metallic and reflective on camera but
trust me oh my gosh you like a shiny wet
looking glossy lip like oh my god so
beautiful I've got that beautiful like
kind of icy pink undertone but it's not
like a chibi I see pink you're talking
about life at home if you're going like
a six year old birthday party you know
it's really really beautiful and then
this color is when I was wearing earlier
today it's put on my red lips and this
is in the shade number 12
iron nude and it's so definitely is way
more of a bronzey undertone and it looks
like that and that's one swipe you guys
you can see up to miss it is like the
formula is just incredible it's so good
and it's not like it's a gloss of
shimmer in it it's just a metallic gloss
does that make sense because like bare
minerals have glosses that have shimmer
in it this one is just a straight
metallic lip gloss and it is just
freakin gorgeous I honestly just want to
wear this red one so bad I don't know
why I have it but look how beautiful
this red one is with gold flakes in it
that's so gorgeous like I can't I need
to wear that
hey lip pod done we're going to talk
about this all right so I should reply
on Kylie cosmetics I have been loving it
recently and the first one are her
blushes now neither the only two that
I've actually used so the only two that
I'm going to actually like back up and
speak on I'm actually wearing both of
them right now on my cheeks this color
right here which is x-rated
has been the one that I have more
confident I'll be honest I probably worn
this every single time I've done my
makeup for the past two or three weeks
because it's been sitting right here on
my identity I reach for every day I love
this like corally orange e blush it
means beautiful you can see they're like
drips in there like in the blush itself
and it's like completely wore off in the
middle because I've used it a lot and
then the next color is in the shade
barely legal and it looks like this so
all of our packaging is a matte cavity
which is cool because they're matte
blushes I've been loving these because
they're not like a chalkboard powdery
mat they're really creamy matte it's
kind of hard to explain but when I first
wash it I was like oh okay like I don't
know how to explain it exactly they just
they feel really really good and it was
really natural on the skin so I haven't
tried any or shades only these two I
actually need to abuse a lot more colors
I don't know why I have it but I love
these and then another kind of cosmetic
product that I'm actually shocked that I
like because the first might swatch them
I'll be honest I'll like what the hell
is she thinking coming out with this
crappy products like really Kylie and
they are me highlighters that I have now
fallen in love with and they are what
I'm wearing today I have them on my
cheekbones the tip of my nose and my
chin I did go over with a little bit of
champagne pop like right in this area
because you know my bitch ass I can I
can't get out like I said it makes
everything better but these three color
I've been wearing them all week long
like literally any time I'm going to
make it with the past week it has been
these highlighters right here and I have
to say as weird as it sounds I feel like
the first time that you get them you
almost need to just take your finger and
I go over the entire thing like this and
just excrete off the top layer of the
product because my first watches were so
bad but now that like I've gotten like
through the top layer I love love love
these highlights like they're very
smooth looking and what I like about
them
way more unnatural they might be
blinding highlight which I know it
sounds so weird to hear me say that
and I'm binding it right away but you
guys would have tied whether some
highlights out there they're so blinding
and so intense that they're not
necessarily what you want for us every
day highlight you know and like I know a
lot of people are also going to get
curly you're crazy I would have blend
every day but I like these because
they're not ads lining they're a little
bit more subtle but if you want to build
them up or if you want to spray some
fix+ on your brush you can get these to
be extremely blinding but you can also
make them way more natural and just
subtle if you will so the three shapes
I've been using constantly it's French
vanilla which looks like this right here
the second one is salted caramel or
salted caramel if you will which is way
more like a golden undertone really
pretty especially for medium skin and
then the last one is cotton candy cream
which is more of like a pinky baby like
has a little bit like a vanilla
undertone okay so this one right here at
cotton candy cream is directly next so
what we have salted caramel and I can
tell on camera what I mean by like them
not being blinding like they just say I
don't know I really like they're
different and that's why I like them and
then this one is a French vanilla which
is definitely the most intense one out
of all of them which is right down there
so if you're really fair french vanilla
would be the one that you would probably
want to go with because very light
sticking with the face I have been so
beyond obsessed this market of Omega
bronzer is expensive of course it's Marc
Jacobs and it is very big like it's huge
you can see the sizes bronzer right here
I used to bribe I also use this to
contour I know some people disagree with
that but I don't care I'm just doing me
I used to contour my cheeks today I love
the color of this because it's
definitely a more neutral bronzer it
doesn't have too much red in it and it
doesn't also have too much of an orange
undertone in it like it's such a great
color and it's so easy to blend so I
will use with a small more dense brush
to contour or I'll use it with a big old
fluffy brush to bronze minimal base in
either way I actually love it I don't
know why the first time I ever bought
this which was like maybe I know two
years ago two and a half years ago
whenever it first came out I bought this
and I used it one time I did
get I don't know why and IV bought it
because Manny said it was amazing for
always family tried it one more time
maybe I didn't know I was thinking and I
fell in love with it so I don't know if
I got like a dud the first time I bought
a couple years back or what I love this
bronzer now okay it's open a net frog
that I have been loving basically just
as much as a Marc Jacobs one I just
can't wear it as often I would say I
don't know I'll play by so this is from
the color pop and Alexis red collection
the exact same collection at the lip
color either this is called the topaz
palette it's this topaz press powder
highlighter and bronzer so this is a
bronzer in the highlight the highlight
is a really beautiful highlight you
doesn't have to have some color in your
skin it is not going to be a highlight
on those of you who are really fair and
lighten skin tone but the highlight is a
great formula very very nice but it does
have a little bit of like glitter in it
if you will not a ton so I probably a
little bit of glitter so if you take
that then you might not love it but
still it's a good formula but the
broader is the thing that I use all the
time I love this bronzer it is so creamy
and so highly pigmented so when I have
more of a tan I will use this one for an
all-over bronzer like a big ol puffy
brush and I will use it to bronze my
entire face when I am really really fair
it will look a little orange on me so if
you're really my in skin tone I would
not go with this even though it's way
cheaper like a better deal I would still
say the marginals we better build you
who are more fair where as it was that
we need to be someone who has a more
light to medium or a medium skin tone
but it is a really really great bronzer
I've been loving it I actually suffer
eyeshadow and well a lot because I think
it's such a great color I like that kind
of like wore me oranjee undertone Saul
you that an eyeshadow I've done single
color pop because we're talking about it
and there's two more palettes that I
love by them
it drives me crazy don't because the
names of these palettes are on them like
I had to find them online but like the
actual name is not anywhere on either of
these palettes but I will link them
below for you guys so you can check them
out for yourself but the first one just
looks like this and then Roger at first
outfit is that the same color but it's
not at all and let me show you it has
way more peach in it like you can see
this one right here is way more like
brown orange E and this one is way more
peachy so I've been using it as a blush
I think I actually use it in a video
I love this color so much as a blush I
just can't get over how creamy these
colors are like when I just watch that
right there and look at how pigmented
that color is like and that's why I
don't only use it as a blush but I also
will use it as eyeshadow as well this is
beautiful and this highlight like is no
joke how payments that they are you guys
and like for the price point I know
exactly how much these cost but like
it's just crazy like it's such great
quality and a great side in this pan or
just a low price point like I believe
it's maybe 10 dollars ish so it's just
amazing I'm so impressed by these
palettes riesling is color pop in
general and then this one I'm obsessive
I won't lie I haven't even used this
color right here actually which I should
because look at out oh my god it's
beautiful
but this coral blush right here oh my
god it's so of course I was eating a
constantly for like two weeks and when I
was using and I started using the kylie
one and now that she's been to I'm using
but honestly like since is probably my
number one favorite like this color is
so beautiful let me show you a swatch of
it like look at how gorgeous that shade
is I got peachy just a very light Corley
okay so this right here is the last base
product that I have and this is the
Charlotte Tilbury airbrush flawless
finish skin perfecting micro powder it
looks like this just a standard compact
and her pretty Roseville packaging like
all of her stuff and then just a powder
it's hard to have our powder on camera
right so it's like it's not exciting for
someone at home we looking at it but it
is like more than with exciting products
in this bundle for me because the Beulah
finds a flawless beautiful powder as you
can fall in love with and Trust vasilia
that sounds like like finding a new man
like I'm in a relationship about other
people are you coming for the wedding
because it was kind of a big deal it
truly is so flawless looking on the skin
is a sheared a medium coverage so we're
not going to do it as heavy Katie powder
it's so fine and like I love it so skin
perfecting micro powder like that is
such a great definition of it like it
just feels like the powder particles are
so tiny and microscopic but like your
skin just looks flawless especially once
you use a setting spray which I'll talk
about
those analemma but it just makes your
skin look so beautiful and it definitely
is a matte powder I would say actually
there's no Sheen in it but actually
makes your skin look kind of hydrated
and just naturally amazing how that all
right I want to talk about the skin now
we talked about powder I'm just going to
say it you guys I cannot I can't believe
that I'm asking you to talk about you
$200 primer right now like who the hell
am i this is just so wrong on so many
levels and don't feel like you have to
get this product you guys you don't or
you need to go get a sample from Norwich
and be like oh absolutely you know I
have talked about this proxy guide
doesn't matter how expensive something
is like it is good I got to tell you and
this is such a good primer I didn't want
to love it and I kept making excuses I
swear this doesn't are talked to you
about like a bad boyfriend like if it
were love it I love making excuses when
it's bad behavior but like no seriously
no I was making up excuses as to like oh
yeah well I was having a good skin day
today that's on my foundation look so
girls like oh yeah well I woke up
feeling hydrated - my my foundation
looks so good
finally I was like damn it it's the
primer it's not me it's the primer I was
going back and forth with all my other
primers that I love and every time I put
this on my foundation is always
happening to look as fast and always
happen to like lasts the longest and
continue to look amazing so I'm like I
got to give credit to where credit is
due and this is amazing it advice Sicily
it's called the double pensee or
immediate and long-term instance in law
I like you guys I don't know I'll find
out I'll link it down below but it is an
amazing planner
expensive but it's amazing will I
repurchase it hey let's get real
yes yes okay yeah well are you guys for
this next product I may be due to take
seat I'm easy to just buckle yourself in
I'm about to show you the best
foundation to ever exist and you guys
everything about foundations in my
entire life up until this moment has not
mattered I was foolish to guess I'm
being dramatic
of course if you still don't get my
humor but this foundation no joke you
guys is unlike anything I've ever tried
and I
just i'm ride-or-die for this foundation
the de vide or forever holy guacamole is
a perfect makeup everlasting wear pore
refining asset with sunscreen dad hey
I tell people online raving about this
and I was like us whatever and it what
it is like I don't care I me a new
foundation I love what I've got and then
even when I best friends Jackie tried it
and she's like Jackson you have to try
foundation of AI Gallaudet at all I'll
get to it and it wasn't until she came
over to my house and I saw her skin Ella
but what are you wearing who did you are
coming in my house was your skin look at
that good and she was like I told you is
this your forever foundation and so I
bought it immediately and I have not
used one other foundation since the
minute that I start wearing this I'm
telling you I cannot believe how many
compliments I have gotten all my skin
and all my makeup since I started
wearing this now my skin right now is
not in a good place
like I said because of my diet which is
fines whatever personal problems
but when I first started wearing this
the first two weeks all my friends and
family who saw me were would non-stop
ask me about my foundation I have sold
this to everyone in my family and all of
my friends because it is so beautiful
it's a more natural to send my satin
finish it's not a full matte like a
natural a satin finish and it just makes
your skin look so amazing and it just
makes your pore look so flawless and
just everything so even and it lasts for
so long I think is phasing about lasting
but like it lasts on me and it senator
the shine control which I wouldn't be
able to tell you about that I don't ever
get shiny but I think it looks beautiful
all day long the only complaint is the
colors I wish they had better color
because I feel like everything is so
pink I have to take it and really drag
it down on my neck because the pink
undertone in it like I wish they had a
little bit more golden undertone but
that's okay those are some bright lights
on Jewish you got on your eyes down so
this will talk little bug little bug ah
yourself feel okay so you know I have
mentioned these before in the past I
want to mention it again because I have
just reintroduced them back into my
major
team recently Isis them love being them
you know you have a product if you love
but you don't use it for six months you
come back toward you like why does this
ever be my vanity like it's such a good
product and they already cover FX custom
enhancer drop and I know they came out
at the new holographic shades but I'm
still more interested in these they're
just like for everyday wear and this one
is a machine shaped moon lights and it's
in the shade of sunlight so this is
definitely a little bit lighter and
sunlight in a little bit more of a
golden more Tanner shapes let's watch
them for you on my hands as have not
seen them just get ready I'm giving you
the morning right now and hold on to
your panties because these products are
absolutely insane so this is a shade
moonlight right here and that yes that's
literally yes that's the highlighting
power that it has is so insane it is
like Chrome on your face but in the best
way possible and then sunlight like I
said is a little bit darker which is so
hot and dark it just a little bit darker
and more weak golden undertone so
beautiful so I'll wear me separate our
all wear them together depending like
what shade my skin tone is at that
moment but what I will do is I will put
on just foundation with no powder of
course and then I will take that with a
damp Beauty sponge like I'll just a damp
you fudge dip it on my hand and I'll
just Pat it all over my cheek area then
I'll put like a little bit of highlight
over top of it or something I'll leave
it like that
well powder around it and it's just so
beautiful and I just applied like a
dream and like if you feel like your
highlight ever looks kind of like crusty
like I noticed like the older I get the
more like wrinkles I get Ryan's smile
really big I'll get like little wrinkles
right here and when you smile you get
older it will make your highlight look
kind of like scrunched up and crunchy if
you want to avoid that using a liquid
highlight will completely change your
world because it'll make it so that it
doesn't like crunch up as much a sec
sometimes my highlight one is I'm really
too bright my cheeks like tinfoil I'm
like this is not a good look for me
alright let's move on to eyes here we go
people
yes I have got some palettes for you
okay the first one is by coloured raine
at cosmetics and it is the Queen of
Hearts palette I've used this in two
tutorials and
I can't say enough good things about it
honest to god this collar is still
broken inside all the way and destroy it
but this palette you can see clearly it
has very loved it's been used and abused
they are so pigmented and soul beyond
creamy the mask and shimmer look at how
the pigments in these masks are yes
right there amazingly even the purple
which the Purple's are so hard to do you
guys like you have no idea how hard is
to create a purple eye shadow so that is
freaking insane but I don't think I've
ever seen a more pigmented purple in my
life than I have in this palette right
here we'll just say a lot I've tried
like everything under the Sun it's like
I want color range to continue to come
out palette like every week these you're
going to look sporting that's not coming
from my ass just so you know so I
appreciate you not accusing me for
farting
Georgiy okay down there buddy
I really do want colored rain to come
out with like new pallets every month
because they're so beautiful
I don't know who their lab is if they've
got their own chemists I mean I know
what's happening what kind of voodoo
they have going on over it like the
coloring labs but that palette is unlike
anything else I've ever used it's
perfection
this is the Kat Von D alchemist I don't
know if I'm saying that right alchemists
whatever you guys are um talking about
it is a little white triangle
holographics palette and it has four
different shades in it to look like this
and I have used them several times and I
love this palette content behind it I
love it it's so small I love the
packaging and I love these four shades
so when you go with original defense you
really can't tell the difference in them
like they always kind of like a white
eyeshadow but the one you swatch them
they all have a different beautiful
undertone like there's a blue one a
green one a violent one and then a pink
one of it all can you see oh my gosh
overall let me get you like a swatch
something like on my arm like that's the
blue one that's the purple one are you
kidding are so glow that is the more
green one and there's at the pinky one
like they're just so awesome like I use
this in my like rainbow makeup look to
highlight my cheeks with and I put on
the inner corner of my eyes pretty off
like I'll use the pink one or the purple
one deposit right there on the inner for
me I tried a different inner corner
highlight it's a really beautiful
palette the pigmentation is on point
like it was really nice and smooth on
the skin I love I just love that they're
like so bright and kind of like lining
but they have like that awesome
undertone like there's so many brands I
have tried to do things like this I feel
like Kat Von D and her team did it right
I say the two guys I products for last
because I need to compose myself you
guys you guys these Stila
magnificent glitters you guys I you know
I'm gonna say this if you like glitter
and you don't only you're doing it wrong
you need to buy these right now and you
will thank me
everybody who's ever recommended into
you they are so amazing like steel I
swear there was a brand like I kind of
forget they exist they don't come out
with anything that I'm obsessed with so
like a year and a half and I listen they
just boom I drop my favorite thing of
all time it just comes out of nowhere I
have gold goddess on my lid over top of
a shadow as a base and on the inner
corner of my lid I have kitten karma so
if you guys have not seen these
literally they just come out like this
and stick they are wet you apply them
like like look at that are you kidding
me look at how beautiful that glare is
you just apply it directly to your eye
like this using this wand and then it
just dries and when it dries it will be
like any normal glitter that's on your
eyes so it will give you fallout like
you can cut your eye and will fall down
on your lashes so once you have it on
just let it be but it's easy to blend
out so you can blend it out when it's
still wet you can also blend it out when
it's dry and that's why I personally
love about this because in general
glitters are so hard to work with them
so hard to blend these are not these are
so easy the next one is kitten karma
which is definitely a more rose gold
undertone so pretty it's so freaking
gorgeous right there underneath the
golden goddess this one is called
diamond dust which I have worn this so
many times this was right in my last
video in the Kim Kardashian and Kylie
cosmetics watch video diamond dust isn't
like a true silver it's like a silver
but it has all different colors like I
haven't purples and like blue but
they're so tiny it does a little bit
purple and blue it just looks like this
crazy gorgeous silver glitter and it
just it's so blinding and so amazing and
then this one is smoldering satin which
is a little bit of a darker one compared
to the other color but it's got like
this beautiful kind of mami purple
undertone so mutabal I swear like what
video live it oh yeah with my Kim
Kardashian swatch video I was wearing
diamond dust and that is all I was
wearing on my lid I was wearing nothing
else oh no no no I mix it with kitten
Karma's no cooler inside and that's what
I mix smouldering Stein and diamond dust
on my lid and that was
I only had highlighter on my brow bone
and this on my lid it has any eyeshadow
I have any base nothing like I do mind
makeup so back that day I just put these
on over top of each other overlaid them
highlighted my brow bone and that was it
throughout some lashes and good to go so
that's how a lot about these are so easy
okay the last eye products that I have
been ridiculously obsessed with are the
Make Up For Ever star lists powders they
come in several different shades but
they are all equally absolutely amazing
and I have two of them right here this
is my most used one hands down I'm
probably out of it very soon because I
literally use it that much I'll use it
to highlight my body my collarbone my
face my eyes everything you don't have
to keep this as limited to your eyes
because anywhere you want it is the head
I'm wearing on my brow bone right now
the tiniest bit goes the longest way
this one is going to shade 13th which is
I personally think the overall most
blinding it's beautiful highlighted one
it's got a really gorgeous kind of like
vanilla champagne undertone like just
one little touch that's what it looks
like let me find a place to swatch this
I'm like I'm writing a space I'm going
to do writing on the side you can see it
like look at how blinding that is one
swipe are you joking that is like look
at that is that not ridiculous how
beautiful that is like it is like
literally sending signals to NASA like
no joke it is like being it this one
right here is in the shade at 0-5 and
this is the one that I use in my rainbow
makeup tutorial I have a purple
undertone but this one is just so
freakin cool like let me where do I want
to put this up with a bright here why
not you can see that this one is not as
frosty as this one but it is like
equally as intense like it's just so
gorgeous with that purple undertone like
I'm again as you find her it it's pretty
but in person it's like 110 prettier if
you guys love just like shiny things if
you're is obsessed and like mesmerized
by the shiny thing go to Sephora or go
to make it forever and swatch these
because you will be in your own little
shiny heaven they are amazing okay so we
are approaching me I'm you're like a
couple products left we're probably 45
mins into this video I can't
along with me thank you for those who
are still watching I love you so much
for hanging on and hanging out with me
okay so this one right here is I'm
working now I don't know if I'm allowed
to be talking about this right now I'm
going to be honest because they sent
this to me Olinda
the owner of more be she said this to me
maybe like four or five weeks ago just
because she wanted to get my opinion on
it because she thought it was amazing
and her team thought it was amazing but
she wasn't sure so she said it to me for
me to give her my fan because I was very
brutally honest and she knows that even
relationship with a brand just random
fact several brands will do that with
like people on YouTube just because they
want to know their opinion first like if
they're unsure about something and more
views one of those brands does that was
me so anyways it's called prep and sweat
sweat really jasmine present set makeup
setting spray now I'm going to have to
ask her after I film this if it's okay
if I actually poses yet so I don't know
what it's coming out I think it's coming
out sometime in the next two or three
weeks I only use it one time and I would
immediately access so I've had it for
about four to five weeks to this point
and I use it every single time that I
have done my makeup now I will sometimes
also use Itachi luminous dewy skin mist
because it's technically in a setting
spray
it's a gooey spray basically like oil in
a bottle and it's good you would really
do a luminous but this actually sets
your makeup but it can also prep your
makeup as well number one it smells
amazing it smells like coconuts and kind
of like cucumber and the best thing
about it hands down is that it is an
aerosol can are you kidding me it's
amazing like you never have to worry
about like because that is my biggest
pet you ever like ever like when I film
a tutorial a couple weeks ago and I was
trying out that new Marc Jacobs setting
spray and I sprayed it and it went right
in my face and ruin my makeup I was like
you gotta be kidding me like that sucks
you know so this like as an aerosol can
you never have to worry always a fine
mist and just set your face completely
even it's so amazing closet smells so
good so what I love about this is when I
spray it on my face I look at myself in
the mirror and I want to make a bluey
transform I think it makes the powder
almost just like sink in to the
foundation and the foundation just like
sink into the skin and just
I just make sure make it look so natural
and just hydrated not oily not dewy but
just hydrated like it almost reminds me
of like a mac fix+ but in its aerosol
can and not City like mac fix+
definitely the stickiness this one does
not at all I just love it you guys I
obviously have to ask more if you kinda
need a lot of talk about this in this
video before I upload it so I don't know
if this firms will make it to the video
whoo god my hair was bad for you though
okay one more setting spray which is
kind of read on talked about this in the
first place because I love it and I hate
it at the same time so I wanted I'd buy
it
it is the pixie skin treats Globen and
it says is with propolis and propolis I
don't know and argan oil if there's a
nourishing mist and it's hydrating so
when I saw this I got really excited I
saw several people talking about it
thinking this going to give me glow of
all about it so I tried this are like
three or four days loved it like it
looks like this it comes out like a
pretty pretty secure pump you know like
it's not a pump that's gonna like
directly spray when ruin your makeup
it's like a nice finding mystical um I
love the way my makeup look with me
might make it look very dewy
very hydrated almost similar to be
tatcha luminous dewy skin mist
the only issue that broke me out which
is why I'm talking about it because even
though it broke me out it might not
break you out
I am so sensitive so I want to talk
about it because if those of you if you
can't afford the top to do it like
luminous dewy skin miss but you're dry
or you're normal and what I try
something is luminous I would definitely
try out this pic see what you can find
at Target that's where I got it and it
it's great like it's amazing
it's definitely a dupe for the tatcha I
personally prefer the Tosh Awards
because the tatcha I don't know I'm
inspired I for that one I've gone
through so many bottles I got probably
ten bottles with that one I just love it
so much but this one is really good but
it right now
is a random product I had to grab seeds
and not my first talk about this is I
feel like I forget to talk about but
like this all the time I used to be
better at it this is a lip moisturizer
and inspired a brand Campari and I was
actually really nervous to talk about
the brand Campari and weird that is
because I feel like they've done so many
sponsorships and they put a bad taste in
people's mouth here on YouTube and might
as well like I've seen so many people do
a sponsored post on Instagram
Campari and like on YouTube and I've
seen some people like be so pissed about
it like not know if they can believe
people are not so I was just like I
don't know well it's not that is Liz
ball because by Safari
I'm not dating bad about them in their
products like their progress try to
actually love I was nervous to talk
about on camera because I feel like I'm
going to piss off you guys but I'm not
sponsored I promise not at all they just
send me a PR package which I'm very
grateful for and this is incredible you
guys so this is called lip love and it's
just a clear at the bottom and it is the
glossiest most hydrating buttery creamy
lip balm of all time and it laughs on
your lips forever and any time I wear it
people happy lip gloss I'm wearing and
I'm like it's alluring to lip balm like
I just put it on my lips and that's it
and everyone is always ask me what gloss
and I'm like it's not a lot but it's so
shiny it will look make your lips look
like they are just soaking wet like
they're just covering like coconut oil
but it's so comfortable and it smells so
good so my mom has tried it my stereo
whenever we're out and I need their lips
to be moisturize I always mustn't use it
and every single time we're out there
lies you have a cult re stop on my just
body or oh I carry with me every day in
my first husband I bed at night like I
learned to get on my first to my
nightstand I put on my lips today I get
to wash my face so I get out of shower
right before I go to bed my lips say
moisturize all night long like I'd love
it so much I actually wanted to get
online and stock up and buy like two or
three more and they were sold out on
Sephora so hopefully they come back in
stock soon
okay last two things the first one is a
deodorant and weird is this is but you
guys know that I am I mean you might not
know I've mentioned before in the past
like how we write about do recipes I
actually hate the smells deodorant like
just like regular degree deodorant from
like the grocery store like I don't know
what the smell will make me nauseous I
know I'm not the only one out there but
I'd rather have vo then smell like some
of the orange I don't know what it is
like I think that baby powdery scent
it's just not me I know but anyways I've
always been obsessed a la vanilla
deodorant I'm usually the sport luxe one
it works great it's amazing but this one
tart sent me and I open up in smells and
I'm like this is amazing
it's a vegan deodorant and it's called
clean queen and it smells so good like
oh my god this smells amazing
the scent is just so good and so fresh
the only thing is when you put on it
will be a white cat on your arm tip so
like after I apply it like I applied for
I go to the gym and I like grab like a
paper towel put a towel that's me out
like that and Dad just because I don't
like white wine all over my armpit
that's the only negative but you're
looking for a good vegan deodorant this
one is really really nice it smells
really good and I don't notice any nasty
scent breaking through and then working
out I will say though I'm not really a
smelly person and weird that is like I
don't get like Co easily so I'm not
looking like a really intense strong
deodorant so I can't say like this is
going to like this is going to make you
smell like roses of our view is what I
really don't know your name but it is a
great sense and I can smell through all
the day and it confuses smell good all
day last talk that I have I'm so excited
to talk about because I have been
obsessed with this product for the past
couple of weeks and it is called say
hello to sexy legs
eliminating fluid I this is amazing I'm
wearing it all over my body right now if
you can see like this below that I have
it on my chest
all over the place does the radiance I
also a little bit of champagne pop and
put it on my shoulders right here and
then my collarbone but everything else
is all this and it comes in this pump I
squirt it like five pumps in my hand I
still have my hand rub it together like
lotion I remove all my rings of course
and I go ahead and smooth it all of my
body you put all over your legs all over
your neck all over your arms work with
whatever is showing just slap it on it
is such a beautiful and you can see it's
just like a beautiful golden undertone
but it's not - golden where your fair
it's going to look like dirty your money
on you you know like it's like a really
really gorgeous kind of like light
champagne color and it's so fine it's
not like chunky glitter like it just
looks beautiful don't worry at
constantly I just love the glow that it
gives me like I love it so much it
technically is a leg highlighter but you
don't mean I don't care this is a leg
highlighter I'll put the show my face if
