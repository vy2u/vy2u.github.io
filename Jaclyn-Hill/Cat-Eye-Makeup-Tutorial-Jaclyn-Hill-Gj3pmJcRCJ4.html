a makeup tutorial on the look that I'm
wearing right now obviously I said in
the beginning of every single intro um I
had no idea I'm calling this video yet
which I also say in the beginning of
every single intro anyways tons of you
guys have been requesting a cat eye
makeup look so that's exactly what I
wanted to do I want to say the list like
a mile longer makeup tutorials I am just
kind of going down the list one by one
and this was the next one on that list I
absolutely love this look you guys it is
so beautiful it's so flattering I've
done on tons of people before it is just
gorgeous what this look is really going
to do is it's going to give you that
almond shaped eye until we're going to
elevate so for those of you who want
more structure or more of an almond
shape or elevated eye this look is for
you just remember that you can of course
a modify this look and create your own
version of this cat eye to fit your
knees your eye shape and what you are
comfortable with but I absolutely love
this I love the technique it's
completely different than anything I've
ever done before and you guys will see
how easy it actually is it looks much
more complicated and complex and like a
picture and you're going to see that
actually is so I hope that you guys
enjoy I enjoy making this tutorial for
you I love you guys and if you want to
see how to achieve this look then just
keep watching bye guys
hey guys so first thing I'm doing is
moisturizing my lips I always do this
before I start my makeup so my lipstick
goes on more smoothly at the end and
there's no chapped lips getting in the
way then I'm going to throw my hair up
in a high ponytail so I get all that
hair out of my face so you guys can see
what we're doing I'm going to prime my
lids I'm using Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and nw20 is my favorite
all-time primer for the lids because it
conceals and Prime's at the same time so
it's perfection
then I'm going to be going in with my
new babies oh my gosh I love these
eyeshadows so much these are the new
Anastasia Beverly Hills single
eyeshadows they will be releasing next
month and you guys will be the first to
know because I will let you know the
second they release their beautiful I'm
going to be going in with the shade
Birkin this is just a really nice
neutral tone it's great
for that crease area as a transition
color it's very similar to like a Mack
soft brown type shade if you're familiar
with that I am using a sigma e-40
blending brush to dust this all over the
entire crease area you can put this all
over the lid if you want you don't
really have to we're really just
focusing on that crease area I'm just
buffing it out nice and gently with no
harsh lines then I'm going to be going
in with a gel eyeliner this is the key
to this look I'm using Maybelline eye
studio it's from the drugstore it's
black as can be and it's awesomesauce so
what I'm going to do is create an outer
wing I am using a e65 by Sigma I don't
know what brush that was for a minute
and I'm going to create kind of like a
bat type wing where I literally just
carve out that V and then sharpen it up
once I've done that I'm going to go in
with a shade smoke this is again going
to be a new shade by anastasia beverly
hills and then using a morphe m32 one
brush which is literally the most
perfect brush for this technique I'm
going to take that brown color and
literally as you're seeing just smudge
it and some oak it out it is so simple
then I'm going to go back with that same
black liner and just darken it up a bit
and you will have this look right here
it's so simple but it looks more so much
more complex than it is then what I'm
going to do is just go in and do a
normal liner right on that lash line
just like you would any other day just
to kind of connect that wing to the
inner corner now I'm going to do to
create that inner corner cat eye is
follow the natural tear duct of my eye
some people's inner corners are going to
go a little bit more down than others
some are going to go more straight out I
typically find if you wanted to look the
best for your eye shape when your eyes
are open and closed just follow that
natural tear duct so now I'm obviously
just going to do the exact same thing to
the other eye again I just draw out that
V with an angled brush and then I just
fill it in as you'll see right here you
might feel like wait what do I do with
the eyeliner because you naturally want
to connect it to something don't just
literally buff it into the eye leave it
alone go back with a super dark brown
matte shade and just buff it out you
don't really want to buff that dark
color up into the crease you more want
to buff it towards the inner corner of
the eye to really give you that
elongated elevated cat eye effect then
again do your liner just like you
usually would right along that lash line
and then it's make sure you take it all
the way to the outer corner so that does
connect with that wing
again I'm going to do the inner corner
the same way I did the other eye this
might be easier for some of you just
using a precise eyeliner brush it's not
an angle brush I definitely think an
angle brush can be a little bit bit
harder but it's just what I'm used to
I'm gonna go in with velour lashes in
the style lash in the city but I always
coat my lashes with a thin coat of
mascara first before going in because I
think it makes it blend a little bit
better and also I never ever go in with
mascara after my false lashes are on
because it can cut down the longevity in
the life of your lashes and make them
look a little bit more fake and I want
my false lashes to look as pretty and
fluffy as they possibly can so I don't
go in with mascara afterwards I always
do it first then I'm going to move on to
foundation I am using hourglass avail
foundation it's a very pretty
illuminating foundation I will say
though that it has a high SPF in it so
it does smell like SPF just so warning
I'm going to be going in with a morphe
brush this is the m-43 9 I believe for
foundation absolutely obsessed I've used
only twice and I'm already claiming that
I'm obsessed
you know what's love when I've only use
it twice I'm using the word obsessed
moving on I'm doing my eyebrows and I
just showed you the first one super
quickly because it was really out of
focus the entire time I'm gonna show you
this one a little bit more slowly I am
using the Anastasia brow Wiz in the
shade oh no I forgot the shade soft
brown taupe I don't know I'll link it
down below for you guys but I am gonna
go ahead and fill in my brows like
normal if you guys want an updated brow
routine just let me know in the comment
section down below I'm going to conceal
my under eye area and I am using NARS
radiant creamy concealer to do this I
know a lot of you have been saying
recently that I have exchanged this one
for the Mac Pro Longwear and it's true
you guys I've just been using this
recently I go through phases and this is
just it's my boy right now so it's what
we're doing I've been enjoying it and if
you guys are wondering I do my concealer
and my foundation after my eyes when I'm
doing a smoky or a cat eye look because
sometimes you can mess up your
foundation if you do your eyes second so
doing your eyes first will ensure that
you have the perfect foundation
application and eyes as always I'm going
to set my under eye area I am using Mac
Pro Longwear emphasize powder mixed with
Anastasia Beverly Hills banana powder
this is from her contour kit and I also
has put a little bit of
and my forehead just to even that out
because sometimes a highlight underneath
the eyes by itself can be a little
overwhelming when you don't balance it
around the face then I'm going to go in
with that same smoke color from
Anastasia if you guys can't tell this is
like the easiest thing ever right it's
only two eyeshadows that is creating
this look like yes please I'm going to
go back in with that original shade that
we went in Birken and I'm going to just
buff that out with a pencil brush on
this entire lower lash line if you guys
don't this to be super smoky you can
leave this part out and just do mascara
and call it a day I wanted to blow it
out I wanted to show you guys the full
production the full effects and all the
drama and potential that this look
really has so I'm going to coat my lower
lashes with Rimmel lash accelerator this
is from the drugstore and it's one of my
favorite lower lash mascaras because it
really separates your lashes and I don't
like clumpy bottom lashes I'm going to
go in with mac cosmetics mylar I wanted
to keep this look very matte I didn't
want a lot of shimmer in it because I
just absolutely love a smoky matte I
like who doesn't it's classic and it's
timeless and mylar is a beautiful
highlight that isn't a full map but it's
not a shimmer it has like this beautiful
gleam to it then I'm going to go in and
just do a little bronzing and contouring
I am using a NARS bronzer in the shade
algorithm this is part of their holiday
collection and I am using a morphe brush
this is the M b5m b5 and I'm going to
bronze my face I was going around my
cheekbones around the temples and the
forehead I absolutely love this brush I
have been singing its praises for the
past like three tutorials straight but
seriously bomb calm I'm going to go back
in with a makeup geek precision brush
and just create a little line right
there underneath the cheekbones just to
accentuate this contour a little bit
more because I really like a structured
contour with a cat eye I think it's very
flattering I'm going to go in it with
Mac mineralized blush in the shade
dainty which is just a really pale
flattering girly pink so pretty and I'm
going to lightly dust that on the cheeks
nothing too intense but we just want to
have a little bit of a flush this looks
painful
honestly this shot makes me cringe
anyways I am going to be applying an eye
Kohl on that lower waterline and the
struggle is real as always as you can
see and then I'm going to finish this
off with my new lipstick this is called
buttercup and you guys are the
to see in the first to know I am so
excited to be using this and introducing
it to you it's going to be coming out in
a week and a half I will let you know
when it's formally coming out I think
this whole video is me just telling you
like ooh this is coming out soon this is
coming out soon but I wanted to use some
new products so I absolutely love this
color you guys it is just a gorgeous
nudey pink I am so proud so happy so I
hope you guys are as excited as I am
I'm finishing that off with a little
shimmer of hope gloss this is also by
Gerard cosmetics I will link it down
below along with a 25% off coupon code
for you guys if you're interested to
complete this look I'm just going to
curl my hair with a Bellamy six in one
and with the power of editing whadda we
are done I love you guys thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you soon
bye
hey guys thanks for watching that was my
inspiration the dreadful part taking
