it's just too much to take you know it's
like so today's video is a very special
video because this is my official
initiation in to fall my initiation into
fall makeup trends into white girls
wearing yoga pants and ugg boots and -
pumpkin spice latte lilies are changing
on the tree except none of that happens
here in Florida because it's gonna be
about a hundred degrees until Christmas
yeah okay but seriously though I am so
excited for this fall makeup look I'm so
excited to get into fall makeup looks I
have tons of looks in my back pocket
that I have been holding on to for about
a month now because this is my favorite
time of year and I feel like every
single time fall comes around I say the
same thing here in my channel because I
love fall makeup looks and even though
the trends always change they still
gotta stay the same like every single
fall it's all about like warm tones and
dark vampy lips you know what I'm saying
so I'm all about that life so today is
the first fall look that I have for you
and of course I wanted to go dramatic
because that's just me like it's the
first one I thought go big or go home
right so I did a very intense winged
liner for you guys today a dark vampy
lip but as you can see I left the lower
lash line a little bit more in the basic
side so it makes it a little bit more
wearable with that intense dramatic cat
eye if you want to really go over the
top put some black liner in your
waterline smoke that out and you will be
like smoke Kitty girl but I wanted to
keep it a little bit more wearable this
is super random and I've gone back and
forth with myself I even wanted to
mention this to guys because it could
easily come off as bragging but I don't
care I want to talk about it and I want
to take the opportunity to say thank you
you guys made me feel so special every
single day of my life every single
morning I wake up and I checked my
Twitter I checked my Instagram I feel
special and I want to get that back to
you guys in any way that I ever possibly
can so I want to tell you guys this I
was invited to New York Fashion Week by
Sephora and let me just say when I say
that this is the opportunity of a
lifetime for me and then this is such a
dream come true when I got the email I
cried I was so overwhelmed like wait
Sephora
wants me to go to Fashion Week behind
stage like with the pro artists like
what so crazy and this all has happened
because you guys all these awkward
these are happening because of you guys
before would never even know my name if
it wasn't for you anyways moral of the
story is I turned down the opportunity I
was completely honest with them I let
the notes thank you so much this is the
opportunity lifetime what didn't come
true but I promise my subscribers I was
gonna be dedicated to YouTube to the
whole month of September but I was not
going to be going out of town and that
is where my loyalty is and that is where
I belong I let them know straight up the
honest truth I let Sephora know that you
guys are more important to me and it's
funny because and the reason I'm telling
you guys this is because if I were to
have gone I actually would have gotten
on the plane an hour and a half ago so I
could either be on a plane right now on
the way to New York City or I could be
sitting here doing this and you guys in
on a little secret I rather be doing
this um I've been focusing so much on
YouTube I've got all new lights
I like set up my new lights yesterday
and I've got all these new backgrounds
I'm in the middle of moving into a new
space I'm trying so hard to improve my
quality for you guys and make my content
the best that it can be I just feel like
it could be better like I just feel like
it hasn't been 110 percent so I'm trying
to give you 110% and that's what I am
focusing 100% on this month everything
else in my life I'm like pausing because
this is it for the month of September so
I hope that makes you guys feel special
and warm and cozy inside because there's
literally no one in the entire world
that I would choose over Fashion Week
but you guys won honestly and I didn't
stay here because I was paid to or
someone forced me to I stay here because
this is where I wanted to be and it's
bright belong and I love you guys so
much and I could honestly cry right now
but I'm not going to but even though I'm
not going to New York it's just so
amazing to me that they even invited me
because of you guys like you guys are
the reason that they invited me and that
is just like even though I couldn't be
there I don't care it's just everything
always goes back to my subscribers and I
love you guys so much so thank you so
much for letting Sephora know who I am
thank you so much for allowing me to be
a part of your lives thank you so much
for buying champagne pop for even
supporting me and letting champagne pop
being sold there it's all because of
your support and I'm just so thankful
you guys got I'm so thankful I love you
guys so much and that's it I hope you
guys have a wonderful day and thank you
well hello so let's get started of
course I have to show you that I'm
watching friends because I always you
guys the obsession is too real it's been
too real for 12 years let's move on and
do our makeup so first thing I am doing
is priming my eyes and then I'm going to
be using makeup geek eyeshadows today
which are
my favorite shadows ever pretty much
let's get real and I'm going to be going
in with the two most common shadows I
use all the time which is Peach Smoothie
and creme brulee I am using Peach
Smoothie first on the Sigma e-40 brush
and as you can see I'm going windshield
wiper motions from outer corner to inner
corner and then I will slowly take it up
higher and go in circular motions to
blend that out then I will go in and
pick up the creme brulee and just put it
right on top doing the exact same
motions these two shadows in my opinion
are such a staple and everyone's
collection because as you can see they
just bring so much depth in that crease
area and they are like the perfect
transition shades for pretty much any
neutral toned eye that you ever want to
do I have a bad habit of using these two
colors almost every single day of my
life I should really pick up something
else but whatever clearly I'm in love
with the shadow that I'm about to pick
up right now
this is cocoa bear by makeup geek I'm
pretty sure I've gone through four of
them it might be five but I think it's
four that's how much I love this shadow
right here it's such a beautiful burnt
kind of reddish brown perfect for the
fall and i'm using the morphe m-43 three
brush which is an amazing blending brush
to put this in my crease area as you can
see I'm keeping this color much lower
than I did with creme brulee and Peach
Smoothie thing I don't want to take this
too high otherwise you can look like you
got socked in the face and we're not
really going for that look today then
I'm going to pick up chickadee on the
exact same brush and this is a beautiful
pale orange I'm just going to sweep this
in the crease area right in between
where Coco bear and Peach Smoothie meet
just to give even more warmth once I
have done that I'm going to go back with
a clean brush and just go back and forth
and as you can see that will kind of
blow out that smokiness so that it gets
a little bit more blended now I'm going
to go in with Georgia romani eyeshadow
in the shade number five listen guys I'm
going to be honest with you the color is
beautiful it is very different it's one
of a kind but it is such a difficult
color to work with do not feel like you
have to go out and spend the money to
get this when I wear this without any
eyeliner it's a dream come true
but doing eyeliner overtop of this was
so difficult I had to go back so many
times and reapply my liner because the
fallout was insane so I'm just warning
you and just being honest then I'm going
to go in with the morphe gel liner I've
always used the Maybelline like I'm
ride-or-die for the Maybelline gel liner
but this morphe one is incredible I
don't know what it is about inexpensive
gel liners that I love so much
we're the expensive ones are actually my
least favorites it's kind of strange but
this more if you want is super super
black and it does the job it's long
wearing it doesn't transfer on my
eyelids so I love this one just as much
as the Maybelline anyways so I'm going
to do a really really dramatic wing
today as you can see I'm going to bring
that point out pretty far because I
really want this to be an intense cat
eye there was so many cat eyes on the
runway and I was so inspired by that so
I really wanted to bring that drama back
today and really intensify that eye
shape so that is what I'm doing and then
I'm going to go in and just give a
really quick very thin coat of mascara
because we're going to pop on some
falsies I'm gonna be using the ghalichi
glam lashes and these are in the style
Miami I chose this style over mikonos
because Mykonos is my favorite lash
style ever but they're really dramatic
Miami is a little bit more subtle
I like how I consider these subtle even
though they're like so intense but you
could see the shadow better and I didn't
wanna put on lashes so intense that it
took away from the shadow and the liner
you know I'm saying you know I'm saying
now I'm going to be priming my skin and
I'm using the makeup forever a radiance
primer I really love this primer it
takes a lot to impress me with primers
but this one has been like my go-to for
the past few months and I really love it
now for foundation I'm going to be using
the cover FX natural finish oil-free
foundation well that's a mouthful and
I'm going to be using this in a shade
g---forty oh don't quote me on that
anyways I'm going to just dot this all
over my face and I'm going to spritz my
foundation brush this is the morphe M
439 with some mac fix+ and then I'm
going to just be stippling this all over
the face and blending it out oh don't
you wish that we can move this quickly
when we're doing our makeup that would
be grand and I could get an extra 25
minutes of sleep in the morning but back
to reality anyways I really like the
foundation because it's so extremely
full coverage at the tiniest amount will
cover your entire face and so therefore
your money goes a really long way buying
this foundation you know what I mean
anyways I am now concealing the
under-eye area using the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer which is my
favorite at the moment and I am using
the Real Techniques damp sponge to blend
this out under my eyes which I recently
replaced because I was so in love with
the Beauty Blender that I start using
this one instead I will
I think the Beautyblender is a little
bit more durable but I love this Real
Techniques one it is really really nice
very squishy and very fat which I like
in my sponges now I'm going to be
setting my under eye area I'm using the
Anastacio banana powder and I'm also
mixing it with the Mac Pro emphasize you
guys know that those are like my match
man and having for my under eye area and
then I'm going to be filling in the
eyebrows I am using the Anastasia brow
Wiz in the shade - Hope and I always
start on my tail and then I really
really lightly go on the inner corners
and just kind of draw like little hairs
going upward and then I blend it all out
with the spoolie really generously like
that's where I spend the most time is
blending it out with the spoolie so that
it's not too intense now we are
highlighting the brow bone and I started
off using Mac nylon shadow because I've
mentioned before that it's like my
favorite brow highlight but then I
decided to go over it with some
champagne pop and the reason why is
because this is such this is such a warm
tone I and champagne pop has like that
golden peachy undertone in it I wanted
to use that as a highlight as opposed to
nylon that's like really frosty and more
like a white yellow it was just more
complimentary to the eye look then I'm
going to line my waterline with a white
creamy liner I didn't want to go stark
white but like an ivory shade and this
is the Mac Pro nw20 pencil that I am
using and then I'm going to begin my
contouring process so today I am using a
Mac shade stir this is a sculpting
powder by Mac and I'm going to be using
the new Tarte paddle brush to apply this
I don't know if it's technically a
paddle brush but that's what it looks
like so I'm going to call the paddle
brush this is only my third time using
this brush so I will get back to you
guys on how I really feel about it after
I've used it a couple more times but
this sculpting powder is life it is the
perfect color it is not too red not too
brown not too orange not too yellow I am
so in love with it you can see as I'm
blending it on the face that it just
looks like a natural shadow which is
exactly what you're going for when you
are contouring the face so I just I love
this color so much right now it's my new
obsession right now then I'm going to go
in with the Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I am using the m54
8 I believe this is which is a really
intense precise contour brush and I'm
going to use that just to dust
this powder on this is technically
called the baking method I talked about
at my most recent video for you guys you
can write this off immediately and it'll
have the same effect but just letting it
sit there and technically bake is just
going to make it last longer so that
doesn't move throughout the day now I'm
going to go in with makeup geek desert
sands eyeshadow which is a gorgeous kind
of mustardy brown it's beautiful and
just using a small pencil brush I'm
going to put that only on the outer
corner of the lower lash line and I'm
going to grab some more cocoa bear and
I'm going to put that on the outer
corner as well I wanted to leave the
inner corner of the lower lash line
blank because I really wanted the top
lid and that intense cat eye to steal
the show so I kept everything on the
lower lash line much more subtle don't
forget to blend all that out though you
don't want harsh lines in that lower
lash line so that's why I continuously
go in with the pencil brush now I'm
going to use Mac style blush for the
cheeks one of my all-time favorite Mac
blush is right here it's so beautiful
it's kind of a peachy orange II shade
with the most gorgeous golden yellow
shimmer and it's just so beautiful I
love it all year round but for some
reason in the fall I love it even more
to them is going to go in and dust out
all of that powder that we left sitting
there on the face so that we can reveal
our structured contour it just makes
contouring so much easier like you can
be as sloppy as you want in a big no big
deal let me just clean you up real quick
now I'm going to go and just put some
mascara on the lower lashes because
that's just an absolute must for me I
feel like I'm walking around butt naked
if I don't have mascara on my lower
lashes just so you know now I'm going to
highlight using the morphe M 501 brush
and champagne pop champagne pop works
perfect for this look because of the
yellow peachy undertones it really
really complements the eyes now I'm
going to go in with vamp liquid lipstick
and this is by Anastasia Beverly Hills
and I am going to over line my top lip
just a little bit because I'm gonna be
honest with you I've wanted lip
injections since I was a teenager but I
know I would get ripped apart for doing
that so instead we're gonna over line
our lips because that's the power of
makeup so I hope that you guys enjoy
this fall look we have many more to come
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys and I'll see you soon enjoy
your pumpkin spice lattes bye
goodness gracious great balls oh my god
oh I almost just ate Oh Moses
announced where are you now that I need
ya mmm sex appeal I love when people try
to call me a drag queen in an offensive
way and I'm like honey have you seen
their skills I will take that crown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
