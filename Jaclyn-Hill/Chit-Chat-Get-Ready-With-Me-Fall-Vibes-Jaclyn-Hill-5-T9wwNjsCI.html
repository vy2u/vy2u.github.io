so inappropriate hey guys so for today's
video I'm going to be doing a like
chitchat get ready with me I guess this
was definitely kind of like a
spur-of-the-moment thing I brought my
camera equipment back home so I am
filming in my beauty space at my house
so today I'm going to be getting ready
to go out with my family and do a little
shopping so I figured why not turn on
the camera and just hang out and to chat
and get ready with you I'm sorry my
voice a little weird I've been feeling a
little bit under the weather the past
couple that can you talk about this mug
right here subscribe or send this to me
is it hot at all week and then the back
it literally has champagne pop is this
not like the coolest mug you've ever
seen in your entire life seriously thank
you so much to the amazing girls of
Mississippi I watch friends every single
day when I get ready every single day so
it's on in the background I was trying
the volume dunk so I'm just so used to
seeing it out of the corner of my eyes I
get ready I'm going to start off by
priming my face I'm using the LC pearl
radiance primer I do two full pumps of
this I'm obsessed with this primer like
even if I'm not wearing makeup
I'll put it launched because I think it
makes my skin look so radiant I am going
to spray a little queen of Hungary a
Miss all over my face I love the way it
feels the weight smells like a spa in a
bottle when I have had a foundation I
just like everything just applied so
smooth so I'm loving that mist it's kind
of naked today it was actually supposed
to be like just me and my niece's we're
going to go shopping because my youngest
niece Jada is like skinny so that has
almost opened my door I was like it was
just money
oh my youngest niece Jada is like the
girliest girl you would ever meet oh my
god I love her for it and so she came up
to me last weekend was like Anna Chapman
will you take me shopping for some
pretty dresses I don't know if shopping
with you at all yes so it's kind of
turned it's like a yearly thing where I
take my nieces shopping well now I have
my third niece who now lives here which
is my sister's daughter Sophia and so
all three of the girls want to go so
like yes so now it's turned into like me
my sister my sister-in-law and Albanese
is we're all going shopping today
gonna take the girls to
pick out some dresses and my one nice um
Talia she's like really like hippy and
like rocker chic she went sever he need
a black and gray and said I love her
she's a girl from my own heart so we're
gonna try to find her some like combat
boots today someone left a comment on my
last video saying that I gave them
anxiety by how much of this foundation
that I applied and I get that because
like when I see someone apply like a ton
of foundation and I'm watching it on
camera I'm like huh because it's just
like it looks like it's so much like
it's gonna kick up but honestly this
foundation is full coverage but what I
love about it is that I personally can
put on so much and get such a smooth
creamy finish but it does not build up
or look cakey or settle into my fine
line so that's why I do such a generous
amount is how we do it this is how we
don't feel like I have to whisper right
now
I'm talking to you guys like if my voice
seems like it's like super soft because
John is still sleeping in the next room
I don't want to wake him up because he
has to be the studio really really late
tonight he has to be at the studio until
like 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning so I
want to let him sleep and I also feel
like so uncomfortable still filming it
of him I haven't gotten used to it yet
like if you walked in here right now I
would be so embarrassed if you don't
look at me like I'm not used to filming
in front of people not even my own
husband I can't even believe how much I
love this concealer it's the Tarte
shaped tape it's just so full coverage
what can I say I am just a full coverage
kind of girl I am still layering colors
because I haven't gotten my actual
correct shape yet my correct shade
eyebrows light/medium Georgie Scott man
what's he doing out there I never know
what she's doing back there what wood is
that from my family's all time I'm going
to take a damp Beauty sponge and blend
this out just a random tip that I wanted
to give you guys because I get
acid random questions about my new
routine all the time my favorite way to
apply makeup is with a small mirror like
I have this one right here which is from
Target at my house and then behind me I
have like a big mirror right here and I
always like to apply my makeup with a
small mirror and a big mirror because I
always back and forth because if you
just sit and stare a small mirror only
when you're done you look up into a big
mirror farther back and like gains in
perspective and you'll be like oh it can
look totally different when you're like
zoomed in it's funny because I kind of
think of it the same way and length like
you can do it so let's zoom into a
certain situation now you step back you
take an actual over the big picture and
it's so different it's the same way with
makeup it's like you got a concept I
take a look here there here there
because you'll notice different things
and that's how I always do my makeup
okay and now that I've got the mask on
we'll just set that bitch in place I'm
going to be using the RCM a no color
transition powder my favorite powder of
all time and talking about all the time
I actually have it in a Sephora compact
right now though because the packaging
is such a pain in the booty so I just
like put it into this old Sephora
compact that I wasn't using and that's
how I've I'm using it now and just makes
it so much easier to use on a daily
basis I just use it straight out of the
cap right here so I'm going to start off
by setting my under eye area with the
exact same damp Beauty sponge and then
I'm just going to set my entire face
this way this has been the way I've been
setting my face recently and I love it
because nothing moves and I will say it
definitely mattifies me which I don't
love that aspect because I like to be
dewy um
but recently I've been more okay with
the matte look I just highlight in the
specific areas to kind of bring that
dewy glow back in the end I don't know
what I wanna use for my eyes I'm looking
at this new master palette by Mario
Mario I always say Mario but I feel like
when he says his name is like Mario um
I'm just gonna keep saying Mario so I
was like a total idiot
I'll give you some of the new makeup
geek shadows hi yeah
some te can do a little bit of both I
think a little crazy up in here okay let
me get it popping okay I'm going to go
in with make a pecan bake sale first and
foremost there's a really nice new
shades that great for the transition
area it's going to pop this in the
entire crease of my eye cuz I really
want get all over shimmery kind of
golden bronze warm effect what snow okay
so blend it out that color is actually
not as warm as I would like it to be so
we're going to have to fix that I'm
gonna grab the Anastasia make it by
Mario palette and I'm going to go in
with Isabel I'm going to take that like
orangie terracotta shade and just layer
that right over top of that make a peak
I chose there really want to warm that
crease up yes there we go give it to me
honey I'm going to grab an angle brush
like this one right here this is morphe
47 we put some translucent powder and
I'm going to put it underneath my eye
area so that nothing it gets messy and I
have kind of like a sharper align right
here I've been doing this method for the
past couple of months and I just love it
it just makes my eye makeup look so much
more structured and overall cleaner so I
do this almost every single day now okay
so now I'm going to go in with full done
what is this I'm going to go in with tan
lines that's such a cute name
by makeup geek and I'm going to put that
a little bit lower in the crease now
oh yes give it to me this color is long
and then the great thing like I said
before about having this line trans as a
powder there is you can kind of just be
messy or honestly like you can bring it
this color over and kind of flick it on
top of the translucent powder and it'll
just give you a cat eye and you don't
have to do a ton of work to achieve it
you know you don't to worry about like
being messy cleaning it up later it's
just already done for you okay I'm going
to be using legend I make a geek all
over my lid because there are some
really pretty shirts and Mario palette
but I want my
I have a more pop than this like these
shimmers let me show you the difference
like this color right here called Kim
like this is what it looks like it's
just a really pretty light shimmer like
that but then like this color right here
by makeup geek this is a foil so the
shimmer is like another level you know
me always gotta get to the next level
this looks so freakin beautiful oh oh
this is gorgeous I don't know how I make
it beep does this honestly the hell does
she create four eyeshadows with no
fallout it's so weird to me I'm going to
pick up a little bit of marina from the
mario palette right here's the pinch
just thinking maybe it'll oh that is not
look good no no not lately budget no no
rewind abort mission abort mission
you know I'm gonna do actually instead
I'm going to spray my brush with fix+
and then go over everything because I
want to give it a major metallic look
okay listen I'm going to use a shadow
that I can't actually talk about young
with something that I'm working on but
like the only color that is going to
work for what I want mm-hmm yes
you also have been done right you gotta
do it yourself honey okay I'm going to
take a little bit of Violetta from the
Mario palette right here it's like this
dark kind of fuzzy brown hair oh my name
is Asya fudge actually really pretty all
right I'm going to just pack that right
here I'm just going to pack this on nice
and gently and a solar
okay just grab a little blending brush
just make sure you know no harsh lines
my intention was not to make this such
an intense smoky eye over here I don't
know what's happening at this point I'm
just kind of going
with it that is a lot of fallout that
makes me nervous even though I have this
powder it makes me very nervous and very
scared whip that away this is why you
set your under I would try to some
powder because if you didn't this would
be a disaster like your makeup will be
ruined but I'm sure it'll be fine
oh I'm stir oh yes hoo-hoo so now for my
lower lashline I'm going to go in with
basically all the mats that I use on my
upper leg which is normally how I do it
I'm going to start out with Isabel from
the Mario palette and a pencil brush and
just lightly blend that all the way from
the inner corner to outer corner all
right now it's going to grab a random
blending brush and a little bit of that
orange makeup geek shade and I am just
going to ever so lightly a feather this
under there because I want this to be
nice and blown out but I don't want to
make it like racoon eye and bring like
super dark colors down too far so I'm
going to use the very tip of a blending
brush and do it this way now I'm going
to grab some that dark brown again it
gave me all that fall out never forget
so now for my brow bone highlight I'm
going to go in with the morphe brushes
palette and 35e it looks like this I
talked about this big time on snapchat
like several months ago because my
friend Suzy who is also known as glamour
by Suzy she has YouTube she's on
Instagram and she's a professional
makeup artist working at makeup by
Lillet studio she's amazing she talked
all about this palette and how she uses
the top row as highlighters for the face
the Cupid's bow the nose the brow bone
and ever since then I use this quite
frequently it's like the top row really
is just like all different colors of
highlight so I am going to be using this
I can go in the very first shade and a
little double do you
I should actually fill my brows first of
whatever Pierce super super lightly I
mean hello look at that can't deny that
alright let's fill in these bushes okay
time to move on to lashes and I'm going
to be using my favorite lashes right now
which are the blinking beaut Samantha's
not kidding I have a whole drawer of
these lashes they just keep coming guys
they just I'm just yes I'm you don't
understand the obsession the obsession
is sick and nasty yes lashes bring me to
life
what a difference right I'm so sweet
look at the camera Frank
welcome cute boy I set my under eye with
some of this Kat Von D yellow powder
right here and I know I am so excited
about the fact that she came out with
the refillable pans I haven't actually
bought them yet but I've got it online
and iudex I'm so excited but I set my
under eye and my t-zone which is a
little bit of this powder right here
just for like a little bit of a
brightening effect since my eyes are so
dark and I also want to do a bold lip I
really want to do like my like whole
vibe today I wanted to be very like fall
and kind of deep and berry so I wanted
to highlight the other eye area and the
t-zone just to kind of bring everything
together I feel like it's really
necessary for me when I do dark eyes and
a dark lip to highlight that and like
make it pop so I'm going to grab some
map give me Sun and I'm going to ever so
lightly just kind of bronze the outer
portion of my face I don't want to do
this intensely though just like a really
nice light dusting just to kind of warm
up the skin so that it really matches
like my body in my arms because I do
have some spray tan all right now so I
just want to kind of warm everything up
okay let me do a little blush okay
perfect we'll do Mac warm soul right
here I don't want anything to be like
too distracting on my cheeks this is
like a nice subtle glow to it such a
good color I have not done my face like
this in such a long time like I just
always bake or do you like a structured
contour and today I just like all over
bronzy and I didn't clean up at all and
it feels so weird but I kind of like it
like I feel like it makes my face to sit
a little bit more like youthful as
opposed to so like all right so for
highlight I'm going to go back in with
that same morphe 35o palette which would
going to use today I'm going to show you
yeah okay I'm going to mix these three
colors right here because I just can't
decide so I'm going to exist this and
this all together get ready get ready
yes girl oh my god
thank you Jesus for pilot I'm gonna hit
that Cuba's bow yes girl looks like I've
got a highlight mustache real quick I
always tap the chin if you're oiling you
don't to look oily don't do this but I
do it because I like my chin to have a
little bit of do since my face is so
mattified I like to add like that dewy
glow wherever you know wherever the hell
I want hey so for today's look I would
normally do a new lip I gotta like get
all this crusts off this does not go at
all as a built in foundation um I want
to do something different I really
really want to have at the fall vibe
today so I want to try one of these new
color pops a little ease if they sent in
the mail I don't want to do something
too dark though I don't want to be like
if you think this is exactly
okay so I have to say this is probably
one of my favorite little colors I've
ever seen in my life
this is so perfect for fall but I was
going to be honest the texture is really
really hard um to work with it took me
about ten minutes to get this on you
might be able to see on camera like some
spots like won't actually dry down that
it's weird um yeah there's definitely
been some inconsistencies in the ultra
matte lips from colour-pop that I've
tried some of them are so incredible and
others are more like this where they're
not very comfortable they're kind of
hard to apply so I'm gonna try to stick
it out though
because I just love this color so much
I'm like looking through I've been
looking at my collection and I can't
find a liquid lip that is this perfect
you know trying to find like a creamy
lipstick that I have a similar shaving
dab over it to give it like a little bit
of moisture throughout the day Oh dust I
think all cuz they I don't know okay oh
that just helps so much this is the YSL
number two this is like the only color
near me that was similar so now it's
comfortable who pumped up well hopefully
it doesn't run though but yeah it's a
really comfortable now I saw what she
was mad I could go over with some
trances and powder but I think it's just
gonna defeat the purpose of the lipstick
and make a dragon so okay I'm going to
go curl my hair really quick I would do
that on camera but I have so many
requests for a hair tutorial I figured
that I would film that for you guys like
this next week so yeah I'm gonna go curl
my hair and then we can get dressed so I
have thought I've been recording for the
past so I don't know five minutes
it was not even recording so hi I'm back
I'm dressed now I'm good to see you
I have been highlighting my the hell are
please call my collarbone Wow and my
shoulders of course can't leave the
house if I'm wearing top like this stuff
highlighting the shoulders like let's
get real and I'm still using at this
exact same palette I'm using like the
whole top row and part of these golden
ones the bottoms well I'm going to take
a little makeup forever missing fix and
just give those shoulders a little
spread make it nice and dewy I'm gonna
give my face a quick little spritz with
some fix+ I'm not just a quick spritz I
don't want to be like to really do we
