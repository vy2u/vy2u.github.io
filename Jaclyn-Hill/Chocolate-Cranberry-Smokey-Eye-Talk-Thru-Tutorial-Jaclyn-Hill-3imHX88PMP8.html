if I like that one
welcome back what do you think of that
I'm always trying to switch up my intro
and it just doesn't work for me side
note I saw Fifty Shades of Grey this
week should we talk about it and it was
talking about it - friend dragged me
along to see 50 take the grade a couple
days ago because she's just one of those
I'm sure there's tons of you watching
right now and you're just one of those
and you love the bulk and you're
obsessed with the book and totally have
respect for that well I know nothing
about the book other than what people
have told me just by word of mouth you
know like on the streets and all the
streets you're not going to be done I
like how I'm referring to myself on the
streets like I'm like in dark alleyways
like getting information about fishy
food grade anyways people don't really
tell you the whole thing about Fifty
Shades of Grey
when you're just casually like eating
lunch they're just telling you like the
cliffnotes and the basics like oh yeah
this billionaire he's like so amazing
and he falls in love and I'm and I was
like totes so I thought that I was going
to go see a movie about some billionaire
dude who's like super young and
successful who falls in love with this
sweet beautiful innocent Ana
and wines and dines her and treats her
like a queen and then you know after a
period of time lets her know that he's
into some freaky stuff and I was like
okay I'm gonna bat whatever make it work
I'll go see it so I was not expecting
and in any way prepared for what
wouldn't out in that movie theater
it started off and me and my friend were
like 10 tons a dozen then all of a
sudden I'm like okay thank God I was
with my best friend because nothing can
make me feel uncomfortable with her
because like hello we're best friends
but they were like oh my god the thing
that killed me and the thing that ruined
this experience that way literally had
to like grown men sitting right here
like I'm talking right here behind me
two grown men just sitting there
watching the movie and I was so
comfortable they're the only men in the
theatre and they're right here behind me
and so things are getting C me up in
this theater I'm just like I'm not
kidding when I tell you I spent seventy
percent of that movie a lying down in my
seat because I was so uncomfortable with
the men behind me
like turn around my shoulder to like
look really quick they'd be like direct
eye contact with me you know like oh god
everyone else is probably watching this
video right now like Jacqueline grow up
but seriously when you go to a movie
like that not knowing that any that's
about to happen it's very like a little
chocolate icing but I will say on that
note I cannot wait for the second movie
because it left me hanging I was like
why anyways so that's makeup today I'm
going to be doing the look that I'm
wearing right here I am using my Jaclyn
hill favorites palette by morphe brushes
which is a right here if you guys have
not seen it so this is the most highly
requested video for me currently is to
do an eyeshadow look with this palette
so I've been asking you guys I asked you
my video and then asked you guys in
comments I've been asking you on Twitter
like what you want to see exactly it
surprisingly so many of you have been
asking it for me to do a warm smoky eye
with this palette which makes sense
because there's so many warm colors in
here and I can't remember what video was
I posted a couple weeks ago where I was
wearing this look and I had so many
comments from you guys asking for a
tutorial on that look and I don't think
I mentioned in that video that I was
wearing all shadows from this palette so
I figured that's what I would do today I
actually love this look I am using all
my favorite shadows from my favorite
palette to create this look today so
like I you like my top 5 favorite
shadows from this palette which hello
obviously these are my favorite like
they're all like just warm cranberry
just yumminess I know it's a warm smoky
eye I know some of you give me hate
sometimes or not hate but just you give
me a hard time because I love my warm
colors but you know what today I felt
like I'm doing me I'm going to do what I
love I'm gonna have fun I'm gonna show
you guys my favorite look from my
favorites palette and we're gonna have a
good time also with that being said this
palette is going to be coming back and
stock very soon morphe was expecting it
to be that in stock by now but it's an
issue with it being shipped to them so
right now it's a little bit of a delay
but not long they're hoping to have it
by the very end of February but it might
be an extra week or so don't hold me to
it like this
I have no control in this guy's like
just keep that in mind this is morphine
not jaclyn hill that's producing these
but they are trying their absolute
hardest and they will be back very very
soon I will let you on YouTube Twitter
and Instagram once they are back in
stock so all of you guys who were
disappointed you couldn't get the first
time well had the chance to do it this
next time and don't forget that if you
do choose to purchase this palette the
code Jack Attack and all caps will get
you 10% off of this so I know a lot of
people were forgetting to enter that and
last time and then they were upset and
they forgot about it later so Jack
Attack is actually the only discount
code that will work for this palette
when it comes back in stock so I'm done
rambling let's get into the video I love
you guys and I hope you enjoy bye and
paleface let's do this I woke up like
this literally I did so like don't try
to make a cute but like this is reality
so face it
alright so my eyes are ready primed I
use Mac Pro Longwear concealer in the
shade nw20 to prime my eyelids and my
eyes look so tiny today's I'm so puffy
from my allergies I feel like I'm like
the first color that I'm going to go in
with is this one right here second down
second from the left it is a nice warm
kind of medium brown so I'm going to be
using that as my transition shade I'm
taking out on end what is this an e 40
brush from Sigma this is one of my
favorite brushes for blending ah because
I use it all the time so I'm going to
take this color and windshield wiper
motions and I'm going to go all the way
from the outer corner to the inner
corner you guessed it when I go with my
transition color I always like to go
back and forth in a straight line like
this to kind of carve out the crease and
then once I've done that back and forth
I then start going in really small
circular motions back and forth because
that will really take any harsh line and
blend it upward okay you to my
brightness out so you can see better hmm
there we go Oh give me some now I'm
going to go in with the shade right here
which is super similar to this one that
we just went in with but this one's just
a little bit darker so it'll give us
just a little bit more dimension and a
crease of our eye this color reminds me
so much of Mac texture which is one of
my favorite shades from Mac it's
actually my favorite I chose all-time
that's why I love this color so again I
do the exact same thing I'm going to put
this color in the crease
of my eye and then once we have it
carved out back and forth
I will then start blending and circular
small motions upward so now I'm going to
go in with this color as well this color
the shade and this one all are very
similar which is like light medium and
darker these two colors right here are
literally such great dupes for max
saddle and Mac texture which are like
one of my two favorite eyeshadows ever
so I love both of these shades and with
all three of these colors I'm seriously
doing the exact same process I'm not
switching up anything with all three of
these colors I just want to kind of pile
them on top of each other because it
just gives such a smooth blended look
when you're done and just adds a lot of
dimension as opposed to just going with
one shade and buffing it out instance
you have this pallet filled with 28
different colors like why not use as
many of em as you can right now I'm
going to be going in with the shade
right here which is just like the most
beautiful chocolaty goodness color I'm
going to pick that up on a what is this
a morphe em 503 I think this is just one
of their new blending brushes that came
out and I love it it's going to
continuously go back in it and pack this
on that outer crease and then work it
upward and bring it in with the rest of
the colors that we have in this upper
crease area so I love this brush then
we'll do is go back with this hullabaloo
I'll go back with the same v40 brush
that I started with you can take any of
these three colors I'm going to take
this one that reminds me of not texture
and I'm going to go back in wind chill
wiper motions because this is a huge key
in blending is just going over things
especially once you've added dark shades
I'm going back in with a little bit of a
lighter shade back and forth just to
make sure that all of that is blended
together and so we have no seams okay so
now I'm going to go in with my favorite
color in the palette and as this bad boy
right here so taking that color on this
brush I'm just going to put it all over
my entire lid and I am giving myself a
lot of fallout right now and what I mean
by that is I'm allowing a lot of shatter
and falling on my cheeks which I'm okay
with I could go in with less product and
I want to
happen but I don't care if I'm not
wearing foundation or anything yet so
I'm just going with a generous amount of
products and packing this on and then
I'll clean up that under-eye area in a
minute what I will also do with my
cotton rounds when I'm cleaning up my
under eyes I'll take it and I'll fold
them in half like this so let me have a
align right here and then I will take
that and I will follow it upward and
that will sharpen up that eye look that
we have going on it so I will just again
take this folded and just go upward and
then it will sharpen up that eyeshadow
like so now to finish off the top lid of
our eye I'm going to put a coat of
mascara on my lashes any mascara will do
for this because we're not really trying
to make them look pretty we're trying to
darken them so we can put false lashes
on oh my goodness Georgie so you can
totally go in and apply false lashes
right now but I'm just not wanting to
apply false lashes yet so I'm going to
move on to my face and then I will come
back to my lashes towards the end I'm
going to prime my face using a Smashbox
photo finish primer water which I've
been loving recently so I'm going to
drench my face in this I'm going to try
this foundation today I have not used
this yet this is the new NARS what is
this called all day luminous weightless
foundation can I test this out and see
how I like it
me unzoom you a little bit for this
because you know maybe all of them are
all for my foundation my hair just looks
so good today you guys I'm going to use
a sigma f80 to apply a foundation and I
know nothing about this foundation yet
so I'm just going to see how it wears on
my face and yes I know it looks like I'm
painting on jaundice but understand me I
am NOT matching my foundation to my face
if I did it would not look good I can
promise you I match my foundation to my
neck and a lot of people will make
comments about my foundation being too
yellow but listen this is the color that
my neck is so I'm going to match my neck
to my face and when it all comes
together it looks a-okay I've been
excited to try this because it has the
word luminous in it in the
fact that it's long wearing I'm looking
forward to seeing how this wears
throughout the day I'm not going to set
my under eye area I'm going to use
Anastacio banana and Mac Pro emphasize
and I was going to make the mix those
two together I cannot talk today I got
up really early and I did not get a lot
of sleep so just like don't mind me as I
set my under eye area with this
highlighting powder I like to go up
towards my temple because this will just
give more of a lifted appearance to the
base I'm gonna move on to my under-eye
area now because I cannot stand seeing
myself with like all the shadow on the
top of my lid in my under-eye totally
Blake first I want to go in with a
pencil brush just like this and I'm
going to go in with really any of these
three Brown shades that we wouldn't
initially I'm going to take this one
right here I'm going to take this and go
all along that lower lash line and
because this is a very blown out rounded
smoky eye I really am NOT going to focus
on making is too perfect okay so now I'm
going to take the e15 from Sigma the
flat definer brush I'm going to go back
in with this chocolatey shade so
everything that we use in the top lid
we're not going to use on the bottom lid
what I'm going to do with this color is
I'm going to press it really tight along
my lower lash line I'm going to go back
and blend it out afterwards of course
because every time I go over the dark
shade I have to go back and one it out
I'm going to go in with black eye Kohl
and this is the ardency in monster black
eyeliner I've mentioned this liner many
times before it is my favorite black
eyeliner ever is so creamy and rich in
pigment it's amazing so I'm going to
line my entire waterline top and bottom
I'm going to let that black eye pole
just kind of sit there for a minute and
I'm going to go in and do my eyebrows
the way I've been filling in my brows
recently is I start in the inner corner
and I make a dart line all the way in
the bottom part of my brow and then I
just kind of flick upward and then that
is it I haven't been doing it much to
the top of the brow I just start the
bottom and flick upward and then that's
all I've been going for a little bit
more of a natural brow recently not
natural whatsoever but just not as bold
as I used to fill them in now I'm going
to be highlighting my brow bone and the
inner corner of my eye and I'm going to
be using this shade right here very
first shade of the pallet what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take that color
and I'm just going to put it at the high
point of the brow bone right here okay
so now I'm going to apply false lashes
I'm going to be using this brand that
I've got in the mail and I don't know
how to pronounce it crown
no Eddy I'm not quite sure but I will
list it down below of course my
description bar and they look like this
and they are full and they're fluffy and
they're voluminous and this is really
going to give us a big extra umph on
that top lid I'm sorry but I just can't
talk about my applying false lashes like
it just does not work this is what's
awkward about doing talk throughs
because there's some things that I do
that I can't talk through like applying
my lashes I cannot talk live apply my
lashes I cannot talk when I'm doing
eyeliner like there are certain things I
cannot open my mouth when I'm doing it
because it's just like it's throws me
off I personally think that it's like a
must to put mascara on your lower lashes
will look like this because we have such
dark
Vavoom eyelashes on our top lid I really
kind of want to match that and replicate
it on the lower lash line as well
otherwise your eyes can look kind of
squint easy now I'm going to contour my
cheeks and I'm going to be using the Kat
Von D shade light palette and I'm going
to go in with this middle color right
here and I'm also using the brush that
she sells for this kit as well I'm going
to be using a contour end of the brush
and go in with that shape
okay so this foundation is not working
for me like at all it is sitting on top
of my skin do you see how blotchy
everything is it can't be the contour
kit because I have been loving this
contour kit gosh I don't know what to do
to make this look better I'm going to
apply blush and I'm going to be using
Mac margin which is one my favorite
blushes ever I'm just going to apply
that the apples of the cheeks and blend
it in backward then I'm going to
highlight my cheekbones and I'm going to
be kicking it old-school with mary lou
manizer by the balm i haven't used this
in so long and i saw it on my vanity
today and I was like why I love you so
I'm going to go in and highlight the
tops of my cheekbones with this for my
lips I'm going to use my favorite nude
lip combination ever which is the
buttercream lipstick that I created with
dry cosmetics oh I just opened up a
brand new tube and it's like so fresh
like yes
I'm going to go over that with Gerard
cosmetics shimmer of Hope lipgloss I'm
just going to set this with Urban Decay
chill makeup settings for me because God
knows we need it so we are all finished
and this is the completed look right
here and I honestly just have to talk
about this because typically I would not
mention this because I like to only talk
about the positive here on my channel
but because I tried this foundation on
camera I feel like I'm just kind of
obligated to give my opinion and I'm
just going to be honest I'm really
disappointed and how this appointed I
invited foundation I think that make
sense I was so excited to try this
because it says right here in the title
of it it says weightless a luminous long
wearing foundation so I was like yes it
is not making my skin luminous it
honestly feels very dry on my skin it's
clinging and settling in every single
little teeny tiny fine line I want to
get up close in the mirror my skin
actually looks kind of old it looks like
I've never seen it before so I don't
know and then when I went in with the
powder to contour this foundation just
like like grab onto the powder contour
and I can not blend it out so I feel a
very blotchy especially right here like
I'm gonna try to like it though I am
gonna try to mix it with an oil and
cream contour instead and maybe if I use
it with creams maybe I'll like it better
so we'll see but let me know how you
guys feel about this foundation in the
comments down below if you've tried it I
would love to know maybe those of you
with oilier skin prefer it better
because I am dry that could be a reason
why it's cleaning so much to my skin and
like everything on so let me know let me
know if you guys have any tips or keep
liked or not and I will wear this for
the rest of the day and if my opinion
changes on it by the time upload this
video I will put it down in the
description bar I'll let you know if for
some reason it starts looking like
beautiful and an hour from now I'll let
you know so that's it thank you so much
for watching this video I love you guys
and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
