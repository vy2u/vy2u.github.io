hi everybody
so as you can see there's no intro today
we are jumping right into this video so
first thing I'm doing is taking saddle
my favorite color by Mac and I know I'm
running really low and it's getting
really dingy and I need to loosen the
purse strings a little bit and just buy
a new one I don't know what my problem
is but anyways I am taking this on a big
fluffy brush and I am spreading this
color from inner corner to outer corner
you can put this wherever you want you
can put it as low it on the creases you
want as high as you want to make sure
it's the darkest the lower it is and the
lightest the higher it is but none of
this matters so just get it on there
sloppy as you want then I'm going to
take Swiss chocolate another favorite of
mine all these warm Browns I'm obsessed
with if you didn't know that by now now
you do so I am putting this a little bit
tighter in that lower crease area but
once again taking all the way in and out
back and forth
sloppy is can be because now we're going
to go in with bronze eyeshadow I'm going
to pack this all over my lid with a semi
stiff brush because I want this to be
pretty pigmented and I'm going to put
this all over from lash line all the way
up to crease you can blend that out the
colors before if you want I'm just going
to be using this as a base so none of
this has to be precise that's what I
love about this look is you don't really
have to worry about things being perfect
so now I'm going to take this new
pressed pigment by Mac it's called
deeply dashing is the name of this one
there's a lot of different colors and a
lot of different shades from light to
dark but this was my favorite because
it's got like that chocolaty warm Brown
feel and I just thought that would be
really really pretty for like a
chocolatey smoky eye so I'm packing that
all on top of that bronze so now you can
see what I meant by using that bronze as
a base and how those colors underneath
don't have to be really precise because
we're just going to pack this on top and
it's going to be kind of like a blown
out glittery chocolatey smokey eye
and I'm just blending it out so that
those no harsh lines with that same
brush again I didn't put any additional
product on it and then after that I'm
gonna take Maybelline's eye studio gel
liner in blackest black and red cherry
false lashes and number 43 and put those
on my eyes now I'm showing my foundation
here just because I want to quickly call
out I know it looks yellow everybody
tells me in every video I am very sorry
that it looks this yellow but in person
it looks good I promise I know how to
match my skin in my foundation it does
not look bright yellow it is the perfect
color for my skin it neutralizes the red
in my face and it's the exact same color
as my neck in my chest so I'm sorry if
it bothers you um
I just threw all my bronzer I didn't
really blend it out that much I'm gonna
blend it out with my blush and I'm
taking Mac's rice paper eye shadow and
I'm using that as my under the brow
highlight just packing that on pretty
generously the most the color that I
want of this is going to be right
underneath the eyebrow and then I just
kind of slide it down a little bit then
I'm going to take saddle the same the
first color that we went in up on the
lid in the crease and I'm going to blend
that with a brush and I don't watch
myself do this part people have
mentioned it before I just stare up at
the ceiling because I don't know why I'm
just comfortable with it and then it's
weird but I'm gonna take Swiss chocolate
the second color I use and get it more
tightly in that bottom lash line also I
know that my eyeliner is like jaggedy on
my left eye I messed up and I didn't
notice until I was done filming but I
fixed it so no worries um this isn't
Aiko by Mac and the shade smolder it's
just a dark black I have just recently
discovered though that Urban Decay's
liner and perversion is even better it
is so creamy anyways I'm throwing on
some mascara on my bottom lashes because
I always have to do this because I have
really long bottom lashes and if I don't
can see the powder on them but if you
have really stubby bottom lashes don't
worry about it I'm taking Melba by Mac
I'll have all the products of stood
below down you know in the bar as always
anyways sorry I'm out of focus but I'm
gonna blend this into my bronzer like I
was talking about before and blend my
bronzer out and this is just a really
nice light peachy kind of glowy blush I
this is a great fallback color for every
skin tone then I'm going to take Mac
soft and gentle on any brush you have
you can even use the same blush brush
and toss it on there and then I'm using
the new Mac holidays collection lip
gloss and talk to me softly I believe
all over the lips and that's it after
that you're done I hope you enjoy and
have a wonderful day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
