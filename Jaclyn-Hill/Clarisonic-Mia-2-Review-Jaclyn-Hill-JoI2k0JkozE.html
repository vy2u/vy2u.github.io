a review of the Clarisonic Mia - I know
this video is long overdue and I'm not
trying to rhyme I'm sorry if I made that
intro a little bit weird for you anyways
I mentioned the Clarisonic Mia - in my
January favourites and the very
beginning of the year and ever since
then I have gotten requests to do an
in-depth review for you pretty much
every single day so I am really sorry
that this has taken so long for me to
get around to but I actually came here
to Chicago to spend some time with my
sister and I was telling her how badly
she needed one and it made me realize
that I really need to do a review for
you already so basically I'm going to be
talking about the Mia - like I said I
know a lot of you've asked so many
questions from is it really worth the
price you know do you think it's a good
investment do I really need it is it
really gonna make a difference on my
skin am I really gonna see a difference
what all is it gonna do yada yada so on
and so forth yes you need this yes and
is worth the price yes it's going to
change your skin yes you're going to see
a difference this is hands-down the most
important thing in my skincare routine
to me it has changed my skin's life a
little bit about my skin as a background
is I am dry eye in the summer months
when it's really humid I can get a tiny
bit oily but it's so tiny that most oily
people will consider it dry skin for the
most part I'm dry or normal there's
basically no oil ever happening but my
issue is that I have flaky skin they can
tend to happen and also I will get
texture texture has always been a
problem of mine I've never been an acne
prone person I've never had horrible
nasty breakouts or anything that's like
oh my gosh but at the same time I've had
texture where I just get bumps and you
don't have anything and then they're
just sitting there on my skin and you
can see them under my makeup and it just
drives me insane the Clarisonic is what
finally pushed me like I purchased this
because of that texture issue because
some people told me would help and they
say that it does improve texture so that
is why I purchased this in the first
place and I can say that ever since I
purchased this Clarisonic I have not had
any issues with texture in my skin if I
don't use it for a week or two then all
of a sudden I'll get like a few little
bumps that will come back and I'll be
like it's because I've been forgetting
to use my Clarisonic or I go out of town
or something like that um it's just an
amazing amazing tool so anyways what
this is exactly is it is a cleansing
system it cleans six times better than
your hands can clean your face it goes
down it penetrates into a deeper layer
of the face so it really gets in it
removes dirt and bacteria and toxins and
impurities and I love that Clarisonic
says that it pulls out the dirt from
trapped pores which is exactly the issue
that I had and so many of us have even
if you don't know it
your pores are just trapped with dirt
and grime and this will pull that all
out to the surface it improves the
texture of your skin anti-aging fine
lines and wrinkles collagen it'll just
help promote a healthier younger looking
you it is so amazing so basically
Clarisonic is known for their three
different ones they have the Mia the Mia
- and enemy I'm sorry in the area or
Aria however you want to pronounce it
the Mia - is the one with two speeds the
original Mia is a little bit bigger than
this and not as comfortable to hold in
my hands this one I love the shape I
love how it has this hourglass shape so
you really have it in your hand nice and
steady it's completely waterproof it can
be submerged underwater you can wash
your face with it in the shower you
don't have to worry about electrocuting
yourself or anything when you turn it on
you will see it just starts to vibrate
it's going to vibrate for 20 seconds and
then it's going to buzz at you and then
it's going to go another 20 buzz again
10 and then 10 again so you're going to
do 20 seconds on your chin and nose 20
seconds on your forehead 10 on each
cheek and then you're done you will see
all of the dirt and makeup locked up in
this one you're done which I love that
the brush head is white so you can see
it you wash it off under the sink and
then it goes back to white you will know
when it's time to exchange the brush
head for a new one because it'll just
kind of look like an old toothbrush
where it'll get like frayed out on the
ends and you'll be like yeah it's not as
soft and nice anymore time to get a new
brush head the brush head should be
replaced about every three to four
months and you can use this twice a day
- safe and gentle to use every morning
and every night
I am super sensitive so I personally
only use it in the evening times I don't
use it so much in the morning times I
have a couple times before nothing bad
has happened I'm just really happy with
using it at night time if it's not
broken don't fix it so I'm happy with
just using it at night there are five
different brush heads you can get with
the Clarisonic there is a normal
sensitive delicate acne prone and deep
pore cleansing I do not recommend the
deep pore cleansing brush
anybody I have heard nothing but
horrible reviews on it here on YouTube
and from friends and family and clients
and customers of how it can really upset
their skin and just make it go crazy
that's another thing I need a touch base
on is when you first start using this it
can make you break out a little bit
because it is penetrating so deeply and
bring all of the dirt bacteria to the
surface you can get some blackheads or
breakouts or pimples or blemishes that
you're not used to because it's going to
come out to the surface that is a very
common complaint keep going do not stop
using it if you stop using it your skin
is going to go back to the way it
normally it was before you ever bought
the Clarisonic once you breakout keep
using this do not give up and it will
push your skin to the next level so your
skin is going to go from where it is now
to not the greatest to the best it can
possibly be just push through that nasty
stage that'll last like a week or two
and I promise you you are going to be
thanking me
and Clarisonic it is absolutely amazing
to remove the brush head all you do is
just push and twist to the left sorry
I'm like which way am i twisting right
now you pull out like that that's how
you replace the brush head you pop it
right back on one of my favorite little
things about this is that you can
actually take this pop the center of
this out so that you just have this and
put that on it and that becomes just
like a spot treatment so you can turn
that on and use that just around your
nose area your top lip or right in
between your eyebrows to get in there
that I just love that because when the
whole entire brush hat is on it can be a
little too big to really get in if
you're having problem areas or excess
oil or blackheads in that t-zone area
which is usually a problem area when you
purchase a Clarisonic it is going to
come with a sensitive brush head on it
that's how they all come originally and
then you can go ahead and see what you
think is best for you and purchase other
brush heads according to what your skin
needs now there is a price difference in
the Mia and the Mia - the first Mia
shaped differently it's a little bit
bigger and only has one speed the Mia 2
is amazing because it's smaller it's
easier to hold it comes in more colors
and variations so you can be
individualized with that and it also
comes in two speeds so there's that
speed right there and then that one
right there you can hear the difference
in the speed that originally comes on
when you turn on down here that's lit up
that is lo the second speed is normal so
if you just turn on and use it it's
going to be on the low speed which is
going to be for more sensitive skin all
skin types is what it says on the
Clarisonic website the normal speed is
going to be if you need a deeper
exfoliation or you want a little bit
more happening I switch back and forth
from low to normal low to normal because
it's just good to give your skin an
extra boost back and forth so it doesn't
get used to the exact same routine every
single day it'll just help stimulate
your skin the most to make it look the
best this also comes with a two-year
warranty so for some reason it's not
doing what you want or it's not living
up to your expectations or you just hate
it or whatever maybe you do have two
years to send this back to Clarisonic
which i think is amazing I really love
companies that stand behind the products
that they're making the coolest thing is
how you charge it it's just a regular
wall charger you plug into your bathroom
and then because this is waterproof it's
just a magnet that just sticks right
onto it like that so that there's no
actual opening plug so you're not
getting electrocuted so that this is how
you charge it you charge it for 24 hours
when you first purchase this and then
you're good to go they say it lasts for
24 to 25 uses without being charged
again this seriously lasts forever I've
owned mine for almost a year and I think
I've only charged it like four times I'm
not even joking it the battery lasts
forever that's all I have to say about
this product it is absolutely amazing it
is 100% worth the money I'm a purchase
if it purchased it if it was two or
three times I would save my money and
get it because I cannot say that
anything I've ever introduced into my
skincare routine has ever made such a
significant difference other than this
so yeah that's that I'm going to take
you to the bathroom I'm going to show
you everything I do just so you can see
exactly how I use this and how it takes
off all the makeup and you'll see all
the nastiness on the brush so if you are

video and I will see you guys next time
what I'm going to remove all of my eye
makeup with these ponds evening soothe
makeup wipes any makeup wipe will do
these are super sensitive they're my
favorite and I just hold it over my eye
area and then gently pull to the side
and all that makeup will come off I had
a pretty smokey eye on so this stuff can
really show how well it works is getting
off all of that makeup you can go ahead
and just wash your eye area with your
face wash before using your Clarisonic
but I just prefer to do it this way
I'm now just putting some warm water on
my face
I still have my face makeup on I only
remove my eye makeup the warm water is
just going to prepare the skin for the
Clarisonic I'm putting warm water on the
brush head as well and then I'm going to
put the purity by philosophy face wash
and a doughnut right around the center
and then you push the start button and I
start on my chin going up to the upper
lip area and the nose and then it will
buzz at you and you will know that it's
time to go to the forehead after that
make sure to keep a limp wrist when you
are using the Clarisonic because you
don't want to apply any additional
pressure you want the brush head in the
Clarisonic to do the work for you so
just keep a nice light hand when using
this once you do 20 seconds on the chin
and nose in 20 seconds in the forehead
it will then buzz a second time and that
means it's time to do 10 seconds on each
cheek just remember to keep moving
pretty rapidly in circular motions
because the full 60 seconds of this
process will go very quickly you can see
all that makeup left over on the brush
head and that's super easy to get rid of
just run it under the warm water and
it'll all come off whatever face wash is
left on my face I then go back and just
rub my hands around and massage it just
to make sure that that makeup remover
wipes got all of my eye makeup on off I
mean and not left with any nasty residue
on my skin so that I'm not sleeping with
any makeup on at all so just like always
just cleanse off the rest of your face
with some nice warm water and I dry off
and go on with my nighttime routine I
will talk about specific products in an
upcoming video at some point since my
nighttime routine is very different than
my daytime so I really hope you guys
enjoy this video and maybe you learn
something and I love you so much and I
will see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
