the tutorial something a little bit more
important than make up I want to
introduce to the newest member of our
family come on buddy come here this is
mr. Franky hill this is our newest
little pup my buddy
hey you see that beast do see the news
this is actually Frankie's like first
official debut here on camera so how
does it feel Brody how does it feel to
other people okay okay
he is honest to god you guys at the
sweetest puppy I've ever known in my
life like he is just a snuggler and he's
just so sleepy and adorable and sweet
but he's got a sadist ass he's a lot
like mommy and I should you guys could
have seen him when I first got him cuz
he's already double the size double he
was half the size of this when I got him
just three weeks ago this is his first
time on camera because he's finally
living with us if you follow me on
snapchat and on Twitter and all that
jazz and you would know we have had a
quite the fiasco getting Georgie used to
Frankie it was horrible at first we have
taken so much of your advice and we have
also um gotten advice from a trainer as
well and just kind of taking it very
slow and been very patient and so now
Frankie is home and Georgie and him
really are getting along Georgie only
has like outbursts maybe it once or
twice a day holds big enough but for the
most part they're doing great so it is
wonderful he's such a little joy and for
those of you are wondering what breed he
is he's a shih tzu I've grown up which
to choose my entire life my mom's head
shih tzus ever since before I was born
and I just love them they're like my
favorite dogs in the entire world
they're just little companions and
they're so sweet and such great cuddlers
and they're amazing with kids so Georgie
and him are both shih tzus for that he
makes that noise every single time he
yawns it is the cutest thing in the
entire world
every time he yawns rolek okay so now
that we have that over with today's
video is going to be a makeup tutorial
lost my train of locked a makeup
tutorial on the look that I have on
right here I asked you guys on Twitter
if you wanted to see something dramatic
or more natural or neutral and
ninety-five percent of you guys said
dramatic drama all caps with
exclamations and I was like hah so you
guys asked for it
heroes I wanted to do something cool
tone because you know I love my warm
tones and I I feel like I'm not as
intensive my warm tones here my channels
I used to be though I've definitely
transitioned more to like neutral side
because if I had my way you guys I don't
think you understand I would be wearing
like brick red wrapped around my eyes
every day with like 3d mean flashes like
that right there is life to me like the
others is so I just decided to go with a
classic black and gray and silver smokey
eye I've never done a look like this
before I have done a silver and black
tutorial but what's different about this
is there's no liner
there's no intense wing there's no sharp
edge this is so rounded and blown out it
literally looks like smoke on the eye
which is just like my favorite look of
all time I absolutely love it this is
very sexy it is definitely appropriate
for a night out so I hope you guys enjoy
if you do give this video a thumbs up
and don't forget to subscribe I never
say that like ever but I think I'm
supposed to maybe I should just not
whatever you know what to do I love you
guys so much I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial and I'll see you soon bye guys
oh my god Georgie and Frankie legit
colleague right now mama can't take a
hello my love's so today we are going to
be starting with our skin so I am going
to go in with a primer I am using Makeup
Forever a radiant primer and I'm going
to massage this all over the skin you
know the drill with primer let's move
past that I'm also going to be using a
new product that I have not used on
camera before and this is by the brand
Tasha and this is a luminous dewy skin
mist I bought this solely because of the
fact that Kim Kardashian uses it and I
wanted that glow so I've been trying it
out and I love it I will talk more about
it in an upcoming video though so just
hang tight I'm going in with the LC
micro silk foundation absolutely love
this foundation I've been raving about
it now for quite a few videos and it is
like my non-stop go-to I am applying
that using a foundation brush by morphe
this is the e30 one this is from the
elite collection which is amazeballs now
I'm going to conceal my under eye area I
skip this part pretty quickly because I
feel like you guys have seen me do this
whole entire drill five thousand times
and if you ever want updated foundation
or concealer routine you know just to
ask and I shall give it to you so I am
just going ahead and using a damp Beauty
blender to blend out the urban decay
waitlist naked concealer up towards the
temple then I always take it and I put
it on my chin around my nose because
women can always get red there that's
just due to hormones you can't escape it
and then in the center of the forehead
as well just to even out that very light
highlight that we're doing and then also
just to make things look a little bit
more natural when you do concealer
underneath the eyes and you even out
other place to the base in the end it
will just make everything look a little
bit more put together now I'm going to
set that highlight using my two favorite
under-eye highlighting powders I am
mixing both Mac Pro emphasized which is
a pro product but you can still find it
on mac cosmetics calm and anastacio
banana powder which you can find
separately or it comes in her contour
kit the original one as well so I was
going to set that entire under eye area
and also the eye lid because that will
help prep our eyes for eye shadow also
the chin in the center of the forehead
so that nothing moves or creases and it
lasts all day long now we're going to go
in with the eyes I'm going to be using
the Kat Von D shade light eye palette
can we please just admire this palette
oh my god we're starting off with that
matte gray shade which by the way this
entire palette is matte which is just
amazing I love it when people do all
masks or all shimmer palettes I just
think it's so fun so going in with that
gray shade and the Sigma e-40 I'm going
to only put this on the outer corner of
the eye as you can see and I'm going to
do something that's gonna make a lot of
people nervous
and that isn't going to wrap this color
completely around the eye as you can see
I'm not separating the shades going in
now with makeup geek Barcelona Beach
this is not completely necessary but I
love this color and just adding more and
more Gray's on top of Gray's it's just
going to give such a 3-dimensional look
and in the end it's just going to look
so smoky and so blown out I feel like
the more colors I use the more seamless
my eyes look so I am now using a morphe
M 503 blending brush and again I'm going
to put that mainly in the outer corner
of the eye all over that lid area and
I'm going to wrap it around you really
want a halo and circle that entire eye I
know it can be intimidating to do this
because you're like wait a second I'm
about to have a black eye but just do it
and I'm telling you the end result is so
beautiful so use
this kind of like chocolatey gray color
it's really interesting because this
color isn't like a deep gray but it's
also not a deep brown it's like a
chocolatey grey and it's beautiful I'm
going to be using an e 22 brush by
morphe and I'm going to again pack this
on that outer corner I love this brush
because it has a little bit of a tip so
you can really get precise with it which
is why I'm going in with this blending
brush right now once you are done with
that you're going to want to go in with
a fluffy brush like the Sigma e-40 and
just go back and forth and blend blend
blend that is what's going to make this
look beautiful and not look like you got
punched in the face is blending so be
patient and take your time I'm going in
with Laura Mercier translucent powder
and I'm going to pack that on my
cheekbones cuz I'm about to go in with a
very intense black and I just do that
that way it'll catch the fallout and not
get all over my face and ruin my
foundation so now going in with that
black from the palette and a sigma e25
I'm now just going to begin to do the
same thing with this that I did with
those other shades and yes Frankie was
whining at my feet that's why I'm
holding him here for a quick second but
I'm about to put him down so I'm going
to pack that on the entire outer corner
but I'm also going to make sure that I
am NOT going above my crease we're going
to keep this a little bit lower than the
gray colors because we don't want it to
go extended too high otherwise once
again that can kind of make you look
like a panda bear and kind of like
you've been bruised the trick is to keep
the black as low as possible and let the
greys go up higher so keep the black low
and make sure that you blend blend blend
and those two things combined are going
to make it so it's your smoky eye is
beautiful and not too scary and not too
harsh and jagged where it can look like
whoa what did you do to your face
because you know exactly what I'm
talking about we've all had that problem
with our smokey eyes before so again
with the black I'm wrapping it around
the eye and again blending it out just
make sure that you really take your time
to pack on this black very intensely and
halo it around that entire corner of
your eye to really make it blown out and
smokey now I'm going to line my
waterline using using ardency in
eyeliner this is the creamiest inky as'
blackest liner I've ever used and it
does not leave my waterline all day long
I'm using the e 18 pencil brush from the
elite collection and oh my gosh this
pencil brush is amazing just to pack on
a little bit more black now I'm going
with a Mac two to eight brush and this
is the teensiest tiniest little
precision brush you've ever seen and I
use this to highlight my inner corner
I'm currently using Mac shroom eyeshadow
I'm sorry I didn't show you the camera
show the camera the product but I was
just so in my zone you know how it is
I'm just going to pack that on really
intensely on that inner corner of my eye
because I want it to be a very very
bright inner corner I mean you can go as
bright white as you want and I don't
think it's really going to be too
overboard cuz it really works since you
have such a dark outer corner to have a
really intense bright inner corner that
exact same shroom color by Mac I'm going
to use that on my brow bone just to
highlight this to me is so necessary
when you're doing like an intense smoky
eye highlighting a brow bone is just
going to complete that bombshell look
now I'm going in with a Mac press
pigment you guys know I'm such a fan of
Mac press pigments I think they're
gorgeous
and I'm using the shade enlightening and
I'm going to just pack that on the lid
using my finger you can choose to use
glitter glue it'll make this easier I am
using a paper towel so I don't get too
much fallout because you will have
fallout with the Mac press pigments you
really can't accept it when you're
applying it unless you use glitter glue
I'm going to pop on some false lashes
these are by flutter lashes I'm not sure
what style they are you guys I'm so
sorry I've used them like 15 times it's
just like one of those things they've
been sitting on my vanity and I keep
popping them on sanitary I know moving
on now I'm going to contour my face I am
using the NARS eita brush I've been
obsessed with this again you guys my
tried and trued I was so obsessed with
this back in the day and it is back in
business and I'm going to just carve up
my face using the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer and then I'm just of
course going to even that out by
bronzing my forehead as well I'm going
to go in with Becca sweet pea blush
using a more feet e 3 is this no this
isn't efore I'm sorry sweet pea blush is
my go-to blush when I'm doing smoky eyes
because it gives just enough color to
the skin but it's very neutral and it's
not over-the-top on the cheeks now to
highlight I'm going to use mary lou
manizer by the balm it's such a
beautiful neutral very vanilla shade I
love love love this highlight when I'm
not doing something to bronzy because
it's so vanilla it just complements your
eyes so incredibly well now to finish
this look off I'm going to be using dose
of colors stone liquid lipstick I
believe this is a liquid lipstick but I
will link it down below for you guys if
you're curious in it it's a beautiful
shade though and now to set everything
I'm going to go in with Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray and this look
is complete I'm exhausted I feel I guys
got done
talking like 500 miles a minute and I
ran a marathon so I hope that you
appreciate I hope you enjoyed this video
I love you so much and I'll see you soon
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
