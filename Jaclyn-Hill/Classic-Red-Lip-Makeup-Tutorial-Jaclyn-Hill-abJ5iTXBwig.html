hey guys so I am back today with my
first makeup tutorial in a little over a
month I think I took off my hand cast
just to do a tutorial because I thought
that enough is enough it's been a long
time so basically today I am doing a
makeup tutorial concentrated all around
a classic red lip this is kind of like
the little black dress of makeup it's a
timeless makeup look and it's really
never going to go out of style and it's
been in style for centuries so I know
that red is a very bold color and a lot
of people who are not used to wearing
any color on their face it is a very
daring move so there's so many questions
involved you know how do I do my eye
makeup what about my cheeks and what
colors are gonna complement the red so I
figured that I would just do a full
makeup look and let you know easy what's
going to look on everybody every skin
colour every skin tone every eye color
there's no exceptions this look applies
to everybody watching this video right
now also I just wanna make a quick
announcement that I am officially going
to be at the Mall of America on
September 14th Sigma Beauty is going to
be hosting a meet and greet for me I am
so excited you guys have absolutely no
idea I have known about this now for a
couple of weeks but it's just thing too
good to be true and today when they put
like the banner on our website I was
screaming sweating profusely too much I
I'm speechless
I cannot wait for those of you who
already told me you're coming I cannot
wait to meet you I cannot wait to hang
out with you I am you guys get the point
anyways they need you to RSVP for those
of you who are coming so I'm going to
put the link in my description bar where

who will be attending ah anyways
everything will be down there my
description bar as always there's

discount down there for you guys all
that stuff what I'm wearing products I'm
using so don't forget to check that out
so yes I am so excited to see you guys
and until then I hope you enjoyed this
video bye hello everybody
first thing we're going to do today is
take mac prolongwear concealer and we're
going to put this all over our eyes as a
primer I've talked about this concealer
a million times
amazing primer my absolute favorite for
the eyelids and it's especially
important today because we're not going
to use much eye shadow at all so this is
going to
any veins or redness that we typically
have then I'm going to go in with Mack
Blanc type or Blanc type however you
want to pronounce it I am using a sigma
brush this is this is a brush that is
gold-plated an 18 karat gold so fancy so
if you feel like being a princess
they're actually selling these now
individually which is really cool
because you want to spend like 17
million dollars on the kids then after
that I'm going to take hello camera I'm
going to take a bronzer that I'm going
to be using on my face later any bronzer
you like will do and I'm going to use a
big fluffy brush this again is a sigma
e25 and this is the gold-plated one but
you know they have the normally 25s as
well and I'm just going to fluff this
all over my crease on top of that blank
type as you can see no run or reason
totally sloppy I'm just getting it in
there this does not need to be precise I
would not bring it in all the way to the
inner corner but on the outer corner I'm
kind of dusting it up for that cat eye
effect towards the brow area then you're
good I'm going to use this Sigma e 75
brush and I'm gonna go in with makeup
geek corrupt
I think it's corrupt or corrupted I'm
not sure but it's a black shadow and it
is the blackest black I've ever seen in
my life
I'm going to push deep down as deep as
possible into my lashes to get this
product nice and tight down there and
then once I have it there I'm going to
just fluff it around with a pencil brush
with no additional products on it and
you're just buffing this back and forth
back and forth and making it the
heaviest in the outer corner but you're
going to bring it all the way and just
buff it until it looks smoky then I'm
going to take Maybelline eye studio in
blackest black this is a gel liner and
then with an eyeliner brush I'm going to
start creating a wing just follow your
natural eye up and create a tail then
fill in that tail you can bring this
halfway and stop right there as you see
or you can bring it all the way to the
inner corner I'm going to bring mine all
the way in to the very inner corner of
my eye but you can do whatever you
please so I'm going to just fill this in
completely and then I'm going to go back
with a pencil brush I'm going to buff
this out again no additional product
just go over and it'll become nice and
smoky without being super dramatic I'm
using the balm
Schwing liquid liner cutest name ever
and I'm just gonna trace over that
original line or just make it blacker
and more intense then I using House of
lashes no our fairy this is in the black
shade that's why it says be okay and I'm
going to just pop these on I will say
you guys that these are very difficult
lashes to work with if you are a
beginner I do not recommend them I know
there's a lot of hype about them but no
one ever informally they are very hard
to work with as you can see they're
amazeballs but they're difficult they're
very stiff I'm going to use urban decay
brightening and tightening complexion
primer I'm using this because using a
red lip I think it's very important to
have beautiful glowing skin so we're
gonna test out this new primer that I
purchased recently and see what happens
then I'm going to use NARS sheer glow
foundation this is in the shade I think
Punjab PU and jabi believe I'm using my
Sigma f80 kabuki foundation brush you
guys know I'm not using this there is
something wrong with me I'm not feeling
well this is my Holy Grail foundation
brush I use it on everybody and I
recommend it to everybody it is V bomb
so I'm just gonna buff this all around
and then I'm going to go in with the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer in shade nw20 the
exact same concealer that I used to
prime my eyes I think it's important
that you use the same color under your
eyes that you do to prime just because
it's going to even everything out and
make it look more natural so there's not
any uneven tones with what's going on on
your eyelids and under your eye area
this is another Sigma brush on a number
of it I'll put it down below I have
fallen in love with it recently I just
got it like a couple weeks ago then I'm
using this Tarte kabuki brush I don't
kabuki powder brush and I am applying
the original bare minerals foundation I
know that seems strange but it's the
super luminous one and I'm applying that
just to give more of a glow and more
luminosity because I think it's really
important to have that beautiful glowy
dewy look then I'm going to fill in my
brows with Anastasia brow Wiz and soft
Brown this is my favorite brow pencil
that I've ever used in my entire life I
don't think that there is enough rave
about this brow pencil because seriously
it is the best the best brow pencil in
the world I'm using it in the shade soft
brown which is
the most universal shade I think unless
you're super blonde or you have really
really dark eyebrows then I'm going to
go in with the same Bobby Brown bronzer
that I use on my eye crease and golden
light and I'm going to contour if you
guys want to see an in-depth contour
video I will link that below in my
description bar because I just did one
recently I'm making my contour a little
bit more intense today because of the
red lip factor and also because I was
looking in the camera and thought oh my
gosh they can't even see my contour I
need to do it more intense and now I'm
looking at it and I'm like we can see a
girl it's a little intense but that's
okay
so contour away and then once you do
that buff everything out it doesn't
matter if you use a brush with nothing
on it tiny bit more bronzer on it a
little bit of powder just buff it out so
that it there's no lines and it's just
seamless going back with that same Tarte
brush just to go over it to make it look
airbrushed and phenomenal then I'm gonna
go in with Mac's Michael smolder this is
the blackest black and I'm going to line
my inner rim you do not have to do this
to your waterline if you don't want to
make sure you're very gentle just a
forewarning because I know you can hurt
yourself very easily then I'm going to
use Mac shroom which is my favorite
highlighter for the inner corner and the
brow bone it's like until the day I die
I mean shroom hardcore relationship and
then after I do that I'm going to go
ahead and put mascara on my bottom
lashes
I suggest you doing this no matter how
tiny and some of your bottom lashes are
it's important it adds a little
something so coat those bottom lashes
then I'm going to use Sun mask this is a
blush by Mac this is the prettiest blush
for a red lip I'm telling you it is not
too rosy not too pink not too peach it
is just so beautiful and a compliment to
red lips oh well then I'm going to use
josie maran argan illuminating powder I
have not heard anybody speak about this
so far I ordered online oh my goodness
it is so beautiful it's like the most
neutral highlighter it's not pink and
it's not gold it's right in between it's
so gorgeous oh my gosh so yes I love her
and then I'm going to dust it on my chin
Cupid's bow in the top of my nose just
to even out that highlight kiss me quick
prolong wear lip pencil by Mac my
favorite lip pencil line is the pro long
wear lip pencils by Mac they're
absolutely amazing
I'm so started a terrible job filming
this part seriously it stinks I
apologize but I'm just going to line my
lips with this you can see the color
this pencil is gorgeous by itself but I
am going to run over it with an
additional product um I do not know the
name of this I am so sorry but I will
put it in the description bar below as
for everything else this completes your
look you have your semi smoky eyes and
your dewy luminous skin I really hope
you guys enjoy this and I will see you
