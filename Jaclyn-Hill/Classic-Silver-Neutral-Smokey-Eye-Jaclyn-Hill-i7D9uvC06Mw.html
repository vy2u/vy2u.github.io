be filming my most requested makeup look
here on my channel this has been the
most requested tutorial for the past
like probably eight weeks I would say
and this is the smoky eye incorporating
colour-pop Koosh eyeshadow and if you
are a part of my snapchat family then
you know exactly what I'm talking about
and you know how much I love this
eyeshadow and I'm so excited to film in
this for you about two months ago I wore
this exact look while I was on snapchat
and I started getting so many tweets and
comments from you guys asked me if I
would do a tutorial on it and then I
posted a photo of this look on Instagram
and it quickly became one of the most
liked photos that I posted and one of
the most commented and requested looks
that I've ever posted before so that's
what I'm here for and that's why I'm
doing this look for you guys today so I
hope that you enjoy the smokey eye as
much as I do I personally love the smoky
eye so much because it's like the
perfect amount of neutrals it's not too
warm and it's not too cool but it still
has like a path into it and it makes it
fun but yeah it's still going to be
wearable for a lot of different skin
tones and eye colors because we're not
too warm or too cool and the colors that
we're using I paired this kind of topi
silver shade with some dark chocolates
and like purples in the outer crease and
I just love it I'm gonna stop talking
about how much I love it
he's getting redundant but nice a long
time I love it so that's it I hope for
those of you who requested this tutorial
that you really enjoy it and make sure
if you get inspired by this or the
colors or you recreate this look at home
make sure you send me photos tagging
your photos that you post so I can of
course see it and like it and interact
with you guys so that's it I love you
guys enjoy and I'll see you later bye
hey guys so today we're going to be
starting with our eyes and I'm going to
show you how I personally prime my eyes
because I feel like I skip over this
step and a lot of tutorials so what I do
is I take my favorite concealer
whichever one I'm using at the moment
and currently it is the Urban Decay
weightless Naked concealer and I coat my
entire lid with that concealer I Pat it
on with my finger and then what I do to
set it is I go over top of that with any
powder this is my favorite way to prime
my eyes I like it so much better than
using an actual eye primer but that's
just my personal opinion now I'm going
to be going in with Mac kid eyes shadow
this is a great transition shade if you
are fair and looking for a transition
color and your crease
is not to warm because this is very
neutral and it's very pale I'm taking a
very generous amount of it though this
is basically as pigmented as you can get
it to look what you see right here on
camera and I'm going to put that in the
entire crease area mainly focusing on
the outer corner of the crease and then
once we don't have as much product on
the brush we'll blend up towards the
eyebrows I'm trying not to get a lot in
the inner corner of the eye though
because that's how we can make this
smoky eye look a little messy and a
little sloppy now I'm going to be going
in with Mac's soft Brown I'm going to
layer that right over top of the eye
shadow kid
this color is tried and trued it is one
of my writer dies this is one of the
first colors I ever owned from Mac and
it is one of the greatest transition
colors both of these shades together
really create such a well-balanced
crease if you're looking for like an
everyday kind of neutral eye look I love
those colors now I'm going to go in with
makeup geek cherry cola and americano
cherry cola is on the right americano is
the kind of dark brown one on the left I
couldn't choose between them I really
wanted the mixture of both so that's
exactly what I did and I'm going to
begin to pack this on the outer corner
of the eye and what I initially do is I
rub my brush into both shades and then I
literally just pack and I pounce it up
and down the area where I want it to be
and then I kind of go in and blend out
but I kind of want to pack it on
initially as you see me doing right
there just getting it into that area and
then we'll go back and blend it out
because if you initially try to go in
and start blending with a ton of product
on your brush it's gonna get really
sloppy it's gonna be falling all of your
face and it's just not going to work so
kind of pack it and then go back and
blend quick little dance break I was
watching friends you know how it is
moving on so what I did is I took that
brush I tapped off all the products and
then I grabbed a little bit more of Mac
soft brown and I'm going to use that to
blend out the edges if you see my
background moving
that's my dogs they are very obsessed
with these glitter backgrounds and
they're constantly pulling at it and I'm
constantly telling them no so if you see
it moving it's my dogs not a ghost so
I'm just blending out those dark shades
on the lid so nothing is harsh but once
I blend it out I realize okay I kind of
blend it away the depth of the smoky eye
and so I wanted to bring back a little
bit more of that dark shade so I was
packing it on a little bit darker and it
actually looks really sloppy here and I
want you to not get frustrated when
you're doing a smoky eye and it starts
to
sloppy just keep going and keep powering
through a lot of people give up when it
gets sloppy but there is a very ugly
phase in every smoky eye
keep going you will see it come together
just power through ladies okay we got
this so after we get done blending that
out I'm going to go in with color pop
couche as you can see I've used as many
times got a nice little dent in it I use
this all the time because I think it's
such a beautiful silver shade because
it's not like so silver that it's like
ice queen and your face but yeah it's
not dull it's so beautiful so I'm using
a synthetic flat brush this is the Mac
242 to apply this color I want this to
be the most vibrant in the inner corner
of the eye and then as I'm work towards
the outer corner I'm going to go a
little bit lighter handed I'm not going
to press as hard I'm not going to sweep
as hard I'm not going to have as much
product on my brush almost like an ombre
effect we want that to be really really
bright in the inner corner and then as
you can see I'm kind of taking whatever
is left on the brush and then kind of
dusting it out I do pull my eyelid
taught like that sometimes because I
feel like I get more product on the
eyelid but don't do it it's not good for
your eyes it'll cause you wrinkles and
then I'm going to pack just a little bit
more of that dark shade on the outer
corner just because I didn't want it to
look too like jaggedy on the edges so
now for eyeliner I'm using my absolute
favorites and this is the Maybelline
blackest black gel liner this one and
the morphe liner are actually my two
favorites I think they are so amazing
and are the most inexpensive liners on
the market believe it or not all the
expensive ones I don't like which is
awesome so for this particular smoky eye
I'm going to do a dramatic wing this
does not necessarily need a wing you
could do smoky liner with this you could
do no liner with this but I want to do a
dramatic wing and then to clean it up
I'm going to take a makeup wipe and I'm
going to just go right underneath that
line and remove all that fallout and
this will help make my eye look as you
can see much cleaner now that we clean
that up now I'm going to coat my lashes
with any mascara this is the L'Oreal
carbon black and then I'm going to go in
with my lashes and today I'm going to be
using velour lashes in the style lash in
the city I love this style so much
they're so fluffy
and they are pretty dramatic but for me
personally they're not so over the top
that they're unwearable what I love
about them though is they go from small
two longer on the outer edge they have a
nice kind of flick kind of wing to them
so if you are someone who say has very
close set eyes these would be ideal
because they will make your eyes look
more separated so now I'm going to go in
with a Marc Jacobs coconut primer I've
just been loving this recently I'm not
gonna lie to you guys
I don't know if it's actually making a
like a difference in the longevity of my
foundation I just love how hydrating it
is so for my foundation today I'm going
to be going in with the LC cosmetics
micro silk foundation I love this
foundation so much you guys know I was
using this constantly for like two
months and then I was like okay we can
step back and give it a break but it's
still one of my absolute favorites so I
am applying that with the Tarka tuck the
Tarte kabuki brush and then I'm going to
conceal and I went hardcore with my
concealer today just go with me okay
people I went intense I was just feeling
very over the top so I wasn't gonna stop
myself so I'm going to just blend this
out with a damp Real Techniques blender
I know I say this all the time but if
you were ride or die for the Beauty
Blender try this one out the first time
I used it I was like I don't like this
at all
no thank you but then after the second
time I fell in love and now I like this
one so much more than the original
Beauty Blender now I'm going to go in
with the Laura Mercier translucent
powder and I'm going to set my under eye
concealer with this and I'm also going
to set my entire face with this but
first I just wanna immediately set the
under-eye area so I don't get any
creasing because that is not a good look
on me and I will definitely get crazy in
that under-eye area fast so I have to
set that and then I will set my entire
face so that all of my products like my
bronzer and my blush a my highlight go
on SuperDuper smooth for my eyebrows I
am filling them in with the shade taupe
this is not my ideal shade for my brows
but it's the only thing I have right now
because I just ran out of my color so
this is the Anastasia brow Wiz I love
this brow pencil so much I really want
to try the hourglass one though but I
really this is my favorite brow pencil
that I've ever used so far today I am
right or die for this so if I end up
switching it that's going to be like a
monumental moment in time for me now I'm
going to go in with the shade Mirage
this is by makeup geek and I love the
shadow for what you see me doing right
now this is the Sigma
five brush and what I'm doing is dusting
this on the entire brow bone not
necessarily to highlight but to really
blend out those dark shadows in case you
went too high it'll make it nice and
smooth and blended which we love and now
I'm taking the ardency in black eyeliner
this is the most amazing black eyeliner
for the waterline of all time it's so
black it's so pigmented it's like Kohl
I'm also lining the upper waterline
which is like the most disgusting thing
in the entire world to watch oh my god
it gives me the heebie-jeebies I'm
looking away from the screen look away
look away rod Run For Your Lives no
seriously thank God we're on the next
one anyways so now I'm going to be going
in with cherry cola you can go in with
americano any brown and purpley shade
that's what I'm going in with and I'm
going to use a small definer brush just
to go ahead and blend out that black on
the lower waterline when I'm doing a
smoky eye I always like to balance out
the lower lash line to have it match the
upper lid I don't like leaving the lower
lash line blank when I'm doing a smoky
eye Nicki Minaj rocks that hardcore I am
NOT Nicki I cannot make that work so
using the elites pencil brush from
morphe I'm going to blend that out so it
is nice and buffed out and we don't have
any harsh lines under there and then I'm
the I'm highlighting right inner corner
of my eyes with Mac nylon which is an
eye shadow and it is my favorite inner
corner highlight of all time now I'm
going to be sculpting my skin and this
is sold out and I didn't realize it was
sold out until I looked just recently
and I'm so sad and I'm so sorry but you
guys know I have 500 million contour
shades that I absolutely love so don't
worry about it
but I'm going to be contouring my face
and then I'm of course going to be doing
just a little baking not a ton of a cage
a little beige and I saw all of your
requests on my last video for a contour
baking and highlight blush routine so I
am totally planning on doing that for
you guys
very soon if you still want to see it
I'm down if you're down so I'm going to
bake that really quick and immediately
take it off I'll talk about in depth
difference between leaving on to bake
and taking it off immediately but for
now we'll just leave it at that
now I'm taking the Tarte bling it on
holiday palette I'm going to mix this
bright pink babydoll blush with this
kind of corally pink blush and I'm going
to apply that to the apples of the
cheeks and bring it back towards
temples to kind of give that lifted
effect to the face and then I realized
I'm going to let it pop a highlight on
the brow bone or so I just took a little
bit of that Mac nylon the same eyeshadow
I'll use on the inner corner of the eye
I'm going to pop it only at the high
point to kind of lift the brow just a
little bit more and then I'm going to
take Becca champagne glow palette and
I'm going to be using pearl Becca did
make this permanent thank goodness it's
such a beautiful highlight for those of
you that have skin white as snow you
will love this highlight it's gorgeous
and so that is the shade that I'm going
to be using today on the top of the
cheekbones and my Cupid's bow and now
I'm going to be coating my lower lashes
with mascara I'm using the Mac extended
play lash I believe it's called and then
for lips I'm going to be going in with
jeffree star cosmetics velour liquid
lipstick in the shade I'm nude this is a
very very nude shade it's not going to
be for everyone but I love how nude this
is and I really wanted to replicate
exactly what I was wearing in my
Instagram photo so this is what I was
wearing you can totally add a gloss or
you can do a pinky nude lip whatever
suits you this look really you can do a
lot of different shades of nude and it
will be complimentary of course I'm
setting everything with Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray and this look
is complete thank you for watching you
guys I love you and I'll see you soon
