Jacqueline that's terrible
haha hi hi hey guys so I'm Jacqui Riley
and obviously you know but this pretty
girl is this is jacqueline hill and she
wanted to do my makeup for years on
camera and finally I was like I'm gonna
do it but the blog because of a very
round face I'm very oily so I feel like
my face work to do but she was like on
taking the physical challenge I was like
you want take the physical challenge she
was like yeah I'm gonna take that
physical challenge day I'm super happy
with it I love this look it's a classic
smokey eye my face is met and basically
it slays I am love angular drag queen
makeup I really do
so I'm always telling her I'm like I
want you to beat me and I just like very
sharp edges so she gave me exactly what
I wanted and showed up which is pulled
up pull back with my people do this
it'll been up no matter no no my face
like up here to go okay but that's
that's what we created for you know I
know with the power of makeup she's very
round the way to brother gods we didn't
grow a lot of angles I will just say
that her face can take a lot of makeup
so I really went hard today so for those
of you who do not have Jackie's skin
type for those of you who think it's
like I'm not kidding hi warning
do not try this at home no if you guys
like this video and you want to see more
Jackie because we really get to have
like fun in this video we just did
makeup we can do like the best friend
tag or I would love to that video where
it's like the best friend versus
boyfriend or like husband and it's
literally like you and John and like
it's a series of questions and whoever
can answer first is the winner I think I
I don't know how when well I mean you'll
give me some tips right thank you so
much for watching we love you enjoy the
video and we'll see you soon
mmm my hand looked huge I was like get
ready for that oh I just want to give
the biggest thank you in the world to
Jackie for allowing me to do her makeup
on camera today not everyone wants to
expose their bare face on camera so I
love you and I appreciate you girl first
she's telling me everything that she
wants to change about her face and all
the angles that she wants me to create
and then we're going to get started I'm
priming Jackie's eyes using Mac Pro
Longwear concealer in the shade NW 25
and then I'm going to set that with a
mattifying powder because Jackie is very
oily
she has slightly hooded eyes so her
eyeshadow will transfer so I have to
make sure that I take the steps to make
sure that this is nice and matte so that
things go on smooth and do not run
around now I'm picking up some good old
scotch tape Jackie wants her eyes to
appear more cat-like and kind of go
upward because the outer corner of
Jackie's eyes do turn down so to create
that illusion I'm going to take some
scotch tape and go from the corner and
take it up towards the tail of the brow
to give her those sharp angles that she
desires to kind of pull and lift up the
outer corner of her eye now I'm picking
up creme Brule by makeup geek one of my
favorite colors you guys know I love
this color so much and for Jackie this
is the perfect transition color it's a
little bit too dark for me to use as a
transition but for her skin tone it's
perfection
I'm using the morphe m4 4-1 blending
brush it's just kind of a long hair
white very soft blending brush to apply
that and then I'm going to pick up a
Nastasia fawn which is very similar to
creme brulee just a little bit darker
but it's still matte I'm going to add a
bunch of different matte Browns and
different shades the outer corner for
eye to give her a lot of dimensions so
as you can see I'm blend
in with creme brulee keeping it nice and
low we do not want to go super high and
bring this to the top of the tape we
want to keep it lower to the crease then
I'm going to pick up desert sands my
makeup geek and the reason I picked this
up is cuz I'm gonna use this to actually
blend out those shades in the upper
crease area now on myself I couldn't
really do this but because Jackie has so
much yellow and honestly right now she
is very orange based because of her
spray tan that she is very unhappy with
this is the perfect color to blend that
out because it really matches the color
of her skin it's the same undertone in
desert sands is the same undertone as
her face right now so I'm going in to
blend that out using desert sands then
I'm going to pick up fudge by makeup
geek and now I'm switching to a shorter
hair blending brush this is the morphe
m4 for three and the reason i switched
to a shorter hair is because i want this
to be more dense and i want the product
to go on a lot bolder as opposed to the
top I want it to be smoother this I want
to be more intense so as you can see I'm
keeping this low down beneath the crease
I'm not going to bring this up as high
as I did with desert sands or creme
brulee I'm going to keep this nice and
low and put it right there tight in the
crease and then as the product kind of
leaves the brush and I don't have as
much on I will begin to blend it out as
you see right now even though it looks
like I have a ton of product on my brush
at that moment I don't now I'm going to
pick up a straight matte black I'm using
the matte black from the kat von d
palette because it's honestly just
become my favorite matte black ever and
the brush that I'm using was a limited
edition Mac brush from like five years
ago but any brush will do for this I
just picked this up because it was
laying there in my collection so as you
can see I'm keeping the black even lower
than the brown I want to keep this very
low down just right against that scotch
tape and kind of bring it into the
center of the eye to give it just that
smoky or three-dimensional look now I'm
going to pick up makeup geek grandstand
such a gorgeous foiled eyeshadow now on
me it looks completely different
different than it does on Jackie on me
it's more like a darker taupe but on her
it's more of like a lightish pink
because she is such a different skin
tone than me but what I'm going to do is
I'm going to pack this on generously in
the inner corner of the eye and then
once we get to the center of the eye I'm
going to just kind of fade out and not
press as hard with the brush but I want
the main pigment from this shadow to be
on the very inner corner as you can see
where I'm focusing right now and as I
fade out I'm not going to press as hard
I'm going to do a little bit of dabbing
and I'm going to
stop then I'm going to do is I'm going
to go back I'm going to grab one of the
other brushes that has like a little bit
more of like desert sand on it or any
brown and the very center of the eye
just kind of run over it so it's a nice
ombre effect and then I realized it's
not black enough everything fades on
Jackie you're gonna see throughout this
video I'm gonna put something on her and
then a few minutes later it's gonna be
gone her face
eats makeup we're constantly joking like
she's the Cookie Monster but for makeup
her face just eats it cuz she is oily
her face can take so much product it's
insane so you will see things fade
throughout this video just to warn you
so now that we are peeling off the tape
it is nice and cut on those outer edges
just like she likes it very sharp so I'm
going to go ahead clean her up with a
makeup wipe so that it's nice and fresh
and I'm not distracted while I'm doing
it the other steps so now I'm going to
go in with eyeliner and I'm going to be
using the Maybelline gel liner and
blackest black and I am using the e65
eyeliner brush by Sigma this is my
favorite eyeliner brush of all time I
just think it's so easy to maneuver when
working with gel liner and for Jackie I
wanted to do a really bold really
intense sharp liner honestly I could
have gone even bolder than this she has
such large eyes she can get away with
like the most dramatic intense cat eye
in the world so this is what I was most
excited for I've been talking about
doing her eyeliner for the past month on
my girl I can't wait to get you in my
chair and do your eyeliner because when
you have eyes like a client with eyes
this large it's so much fun to create
things that you can't really do on
yourself and look as good you know I'm
saying her eyes were made for this so
I'm gonna be using ghalichi glam Mykonos
lashes these are very dramatic for me
personally they are like Vava voom
smokey drama intense on Jackie because
her eye shape is so different there
honestly she could wear these just
day-to-day and just look normal on me
they're definitely party going out
dramatic lashes but I think they're so
beautiful and they really complement
this look now we're going to prime her
face and we're going to use the
hourglass a mineral veil primer this
really helps with oil control and it's
one of Jackie's personal favorites
because she has a really hard time
finding primers that really helped her
with her oil control and this one
actually does do the trick for her then
we're going to go in with the Becca ever
matte foundation and we
using the shade tan now Jackie was
complaining about the color that she was
I thought she looked beautiful but
Jackie thinks that she her face looks
way too orange and she did not want to
be that orange so we're gonna take a lot
of steps to try to neutralize her face
and at one point in this video she is
gonna look kind of grey but in the end
after her face eats all the makeup it's
gonna look perfect so it's just a
process you got to go along with the
process I am using the Tarte foundation
kabuki brush to apply this it's a very
large brush and it's one of my favorites
for applying foundation now for the
under eye concealer I'm going to use the
Mac Pro Longwear and NW 25 now I did not
know this but Jackie had applied some
Shiseido eye cream right before we did
this and it's extremely thick so I was
having major issues with her concealer
like creasing and like when I did her
under eyes running just a tip try not to
apply a really thick under eye cream
before going in with your foundation
your concealer because that will be an
issue so I really really really had to
make her like keep her eyes looking up
because I'm like girl you will not stop
creasing like it was a Creasy mess under
there and I did not know that she
applied that eye cream until maybe 30
minutes later she was like oh I applied
my cream I was like thanks for telling
me so now for her actual face I'm gonna
use the RCM a no color powder I'm gonna
put this on her entire face to keep her
nice and matte Jackie said that she
stayed matte all day long she washed her
face off at about midnight this night
and we were filming this at about two
o'clock in the afternoon and she was
like I'm so mad she was very excited so
this powder kept her matte so that's
exciting for the oily girls out there so
now I'm going to sculpt her cheeks and
I'm going to be using the same exact
color I use on myself because I wanted
to bring back some warmth because her
face was looking very grey as we were
trying to neutralize it so I'm going to
be using Mac shade ster which is a pro
contour color you can get on mac
cosmetics calm and I'm going to really
put that all around the outer part of
her face bring it in
down towards the lips and then I'm going
to bake this girl like we have never
baked before we have this joke because
Jackie loves to cook and she's always in
my kitchen whipping up some amazing meal
and so she's always like okay I cook for
you you bake for me so anytime we go out
and she wants that structured contour
I'm always baking her face because
that's what friends do right
they bake each other we
each other nice and hard so she see her
complaining she's like don't you feel
bad for me my face is so difficult and
I'm like oh my god I can't with her
I just can't so now I'm gonna fill in
her brows and she was literally like
holding her breath because like she's
like Jacqueline I don't know how you're
gonna do this because as you can see she
has little to no well she just has a few
hairs her hairs are very sparse they're
kind of out of control they don't really
go in the same direction and this is
very common for people to have these
types of brows most people do not have
flawless brows like we can't all have
gigi hadid brows and kylie jenner brows
it's just not realistic so what I did is
I went in with the Anastasia brow
definer if you guys want an in-depth
tutorial on Jackie's brows I could
totally do that for you guys if you
really want to see that because I feel
like she does have pretty common brows
because a lot of people struggle with
filling in their brows and the Anastasia
brow definer really just makes your
brows look so natural she was so in love
with them at the end of the night she
washed her face but she was like no I
don't want to wipe off my brows yeah I
don't want to part with them so we used
the brow definer in the shade caramel to
bring back some warmth because we didn't
want her to look too cool and too ashy
because we wanted it to kind of match
her body and her body is a little orange
so we wanted to keep her brows nice and
warm and not too cool not too ashy
looking then with some concealer I just
cleaned up the outer tail cuz I didn't
want to look messy or sloppy I'm only
doing this on the outer tail though I
want it to stay like a little fluffy a
little bit more natural-looking on the
inner part of the brow now she's going
to line her lower waterline with some
black kohl liner this is my ardency in I
didn't do this for her because we
couldn't find a sharpener and it was at
like the very end and I didn't want to
poke her and hurt her so she's doing
this part herself and Jacqui agrees that
the ardency Inn Michael is the best I
call for the waterline when it comes to
things transferring and running it's her
favorite as well as mine so now I'm
going to go back in with some more black
and this is a black from Kat Von D shade
light eye palette and a small definer
brush and I'm just going to kind of
smoke out that eye cold that she has on
the lower waterline but I'm not going to
bring it down too far I'm going to grab
some Mac saddle which is a nice warm
brown on a pencil brush and then right
underneath of that black I'm going to
begin to just kind of buff and smoke
that out because Jackie has such large
eyes honestly you can smoke out her
lower lashline down to her
cheekbone and it just keeps looking more
and more and more beautiful and Jackie
is always afraid to smoke out her lower
lashline so she was that girl's smoke me
so she was loving it as I was smoking
out her lower lashline because it just
looks so beautiful on her so I'm popping
some nylon on the inner corner of her
eye as a highlight but I'm only going to
use that on the inner corner not on her
brow bone because it is very bright on
her skin tone I'm going to go back in
with a little bit more black just to
darken that up one more time because it
will lighten and it will fade on her
that's just what happened so I want to
make it nice and dark and I'm grabbing
some L'Oreal voluminous mascara and I'm
just going to put down her natural
lashes so that they blend better with
the falsies and I'm going to go back in
with the same Maybelline gel liner and
just run over it one more time because
it was lightening a little bit and I
just wanted to make it look nice and
pitch black and fresh I'm gonna go in
with makeup geek Mirage eyeshadow and
use that as her brow bone highlight you
guys know how much I love Mac nylon but
on Jackie it would be way too frosty and
like too white so Mirage is perfect for
her skin tone it's one of my favorite
highlights it just complimented her so
so well not too frosty and not too matte
just perfection then for blush I'm going
to mix to make it beep blushes and
they're both going to be on the bright
side I am using summer fling and love
affair and I'm going to generously apply
these to the apples of her cheeks and
bring them back into her contour as you
can see I'm making it's very bold
because in about 15 minutes this blush
is going to fade and become a more
realistic shape because that's what
happens when you have skin like Jackies
and it's got a lot of oil in it it just
kind of eats away your makeup so I go
really strong that way when it fades it
looks perfect you know what I'm saying
so now I'm going to go ahead and just
wipe away that bacon that we have the
translucent powder and I'm going to add
a little bit of it just the top of the
hairline completely avoiding the center
of the forehead I only wanted to just
bronze up just the hairline and I'm
gonna put a little bit of mascara on her
lower lashes and I'm just taking a
little bit of that same transfer scent
powder and kind of wiping away the top
of her blush because I felt like it came
up too high and was making her cheeks
look too big okay
so I contour Jackie's nose quite often
because she really loves it when I
contour her nose but you guys I'm gonna
go through this quickly because
I am very upset about how this looks on
camera in person we both loved it it
looks gorgeous on camera it looks like a
zebra stripe and it's really upsetting
to me but that's just what happens
sometimes when it comes to filming
things look different and we didn't
notice until we were completely done for
the day and we're like what the heck why
does it look like that but it'll fade
and look more natural in about 15
minutes that's the good news so I am
highlighting her with champagne pop and
I don't want it to be too super intense
so I'm going to kind of blend it out
with her blush so it's kind of an
all-over highlight as opposed to an
intense highlight now she is telling me
what she wants me to fix about her lips
because she has uneven lips as we all do
right I'm pretty sure we all have this
struggle but the good thing about Jackie
is the edges of her lips are very flat
so she has the easiest lips to
manipulate and adjust the shape because
they are so flat like mine the edges are
very curved so when I over line any part
of my lip it's like girl what are you
trying to do we see that over line but
with Jackie you can over line it up to
her flipping nostril and you cannot see
where her natural lip line is I'm so
envious so I did use the charlotte
tilbury iconic nude lip liner and then
now I am using the Makeup Forever aqua
Rouge liquid lip and number three it's a
really pretty kind of Mavi pink and we
wanted it to be super glossy so after we
do this matte lip I'm gonna go in with a
Marc Jacobs gloss and honestly guys I
don't know which one it is but I will
find it
the exact name and put it in the bottom
bar it's got a little bit of shimmer in
it it's like a Mavi sate it's beautiful
and I thought it was perfect for this
color so after that this look is
complete you guys I hope that you enjoy
me and Jackie had such a great time
filming this she loved the outcome I
loved the outcome other than that damns
you brought a stripe on her nose but
anyways thank you for watching I love
you so much and I'll see you soon bye
