a collective haul for you basically I
have done way too much shopping this
last month and I'm gonna show you what I
bought so let's go I'm just going to
start off with Sephora I actually am
like obsessed with this bag it's so
convenient to carry around the mall I
really really like it
first thing I got are two tarte holiday
gift sets I got the lip one right here
and then I got the Amazonian clay and
blush palette right here let me show you
love how sparkly the packaging is on
this Tarte palette and then inside you
have these five blushes and it comes
with a bronzer right here for the fifth
color so I love the Tarte Amazonian clay
blushes and I only own one or two so I
thought that this was like the perfect
timing to pick up more and I love the
holidays for this reason because they
come out with all these gift sets for
makeup and it's like I'm going to put
this in front of me make my life a
little easier then I got the fresh black
tea instant perfecting mask I have been
obsessing over face my face mask
recently I absolutely love this product
I've used it twice so far and I'm really
enjoying it the girl Sephora literally
sold me on it and it says it is advanced
antioxidants immediately reveals softer
firmer skin okay I swear to god you guys
I can read just not today
I love the way it feels it's really
really different really unique yeah it's
really awesome and then when I got home
I was thinking about it I was like my
totals really high for just like six
things and I looked through the receipt
ice cannot talk today and I was like oh
my god yeah this is a freaking expensive
and then I got this with Nicole this is
a facial oil I do not know how to
pronounce this brand bastia Mosca bastia
la bas Kia I have no idea but I predict
that you guys are gonna leave thousands
of comments down below telling me
exactly how to pronounce this and I will
be a pro by tonight ways it's basically
an anti-aging facial oil and it helps to
protect the skin against free radicals
and anti aging so I'm really excited it
said it's Sephora that it would give you
the most baby soft skin and I own I
think 4 or 5 face oils and I'm like
constantly collecting them and I'm so
dry that face oils are like my BFF so
I'm really really excited to try this
and it looks like that in case you care
thank you
then I got these Smashbox soft lights in
the shade shimmer which is the
highlighter that I was telling you guys
I love so much in the Smashbox
masterclass 2 palette so I picked it up
individually because every day I'm like
reaching for my palette just to use this
shimmer so I thought it would save me
time and space just to get it
individually so yeah I'm really really
happy that you guys tell me the Sephora
sold this because I will get a lot of
use out of this little guy another
highlighter that I got is by Laura
Mercier and this one is called the matte
radiance baked powder and highlight zero
one I don't know why I said it's matte
it's definitely not matte I'm wearing it
today all over my cheekbones okay so I
have another favorite highlighter this
is Gorge it is the prettiest color so
this is the smashbox one and then this
is the laura mercier so Laura Mercier in
my opinion is more of a vanilla or the
Smashbox is a little bit more pink this
one is just absolutely gorgeous I think
that most people would get more use out
of the Laura Mercier one than the
Smashbox I don't know why I'm comparing
them just because they're both on my
hand
but I really really love this Laura
Mercier one and I've only owned it for
two days and I love it
I got a cover of X foundation I meant to
get the cream one and I got the powder
so it's irrelevant
I got another Laura Mercier silk cream
foundation in a lighter shade I
absolutely love this foundation and I
had typically sand these but I got
bamboo beige instead because I haven't
been able to wear it recently because I
am much more fair than I used to be even
though I use sunless tanner a lot I use
the million dollar tan most of the time
to keep some glow in my skin and some
color I think I'm going to embrace this
paleness this winter because it's winter
and I haven't embraced it in so long
I mean I'll still self tan but probably
like once a month whatever I got the
NARS radiant creamy concealer I don't
have a box for this because I've had
this now for like two weeks and I've
been using it everyday and I really like
it so I have mine in shade vanilla yeah
light too vanilla I really really like
this it doesn't crease on me at all it's
nice and creamy smooth moisturize and
easy to blend what more could you ask
for sticking with NARS I got two
products from the NARS gut gay guy guy
boarding collection I can't read
today and this is seriously the cutest
little eye shadow of all time look how
little it is it's so baby like here like
look at this compared to the bronzer oh
my god it's such a little baby it's so
cute okay anyways so I got this in
Mississippi mermaid strange name for
just like the most basic shade of all
time it is a gorgeous gold base all over
lid color right there it is so pretty I
have really really been enjoying just
these nice shimmery light neutral shades
for the eyelid recently and then doing
whatever you want in the crease whether
it's like warm Browns or Purple's or
Burgundy's or whatever you want to put
in your crease I just have really really
been liking these neutral shades for all
over the lid then I also got the blush
called
daydream I really like this blush I feel
like I don't have okay I'm not gonna get
dramatic I'm sure I do the blush it's
like this exact same shade but not from
NARS and not in my mind it is such a
pretty rosy pink it has a little bit of
peach in it not much but it's not
completely cool tone but it's not
completely warm tone so it's a really
nice shade for universal skin tones I
really really like this I've used it
once and I love it already
yes I'm committed then I got a buxom
lipstick and I really like these
lipsticks and this isn't nudist I wish
they would have come out with more
because so this is just as always a nice
nude color you know I love my boobs so
this is a peachy or nude right there you
can see it's really nude there's not
much color in it but the color that is
in it is peach which I like I like peach
a lot and oh I did not buy this Nicole
actually gave this to me it is a revlon
colorburst the new ones just came out
and she had in her purse instead she
actually bought two so she just gave it
to me so thanks girl so totally random I
obviously ordered these in the mail but
I got two lime crime lipsticks really
really love lime cremes formula and of
course like I thought he says the
packaging is just adorbs
I got the shade Bay Beck and Cosmo pop
I'm actually wearing them both right now
well they're kind of fading but I've
been wearing them for a while on my lips
this is babe at right here it's just a
really nice
creamy orangie pink it's a really
beautiful coral it's a different color
to explain and when I got it in the mail
I wasn't expecting it to be this pretty
I was expecting to be pretty obviously
that's because I ordered it but not as
pretty as it actually is
and then Cosmo pop which is right there
which is straight orange and I actually
wasn't expecting Cosmo pop to be as
orange as it is I've seen Cosmo pop all
over Instagram I feel like everybody and
their mom owns Cosmo pop and it's never
looked this orange to me when I put it
on I was like this is orange so I'm
obviously going to be mixing it with
like glosses and liners and stuff like
that
so I dragged Nicole into lush with me to
get the mask of magnet the mask of Magna
MIDI and the reason I got this is
because my sister just raves about it my
sister actually has a blog I will link
it in the description bar below she is
an aesthetician and knows all about the
skin and I'm the makeup artist that does
everything makeup so mean her together
were dangerous for one another but she
recently started a blog and she actually
made a post on skincare and she
mentioned this mask and I literally text
her I was like really
you sold me on those masks so I had to
go to the mall and get it I it's
basically just supposed to draw all the
bad stuff the impurities and bacteria
out of your skin bring it to the surface
just a really deep clean and it says
that the perfect amount of peppermint
works with your body and wakes up
sluggish skin and this is for all skin
types I used it last night
love a couple things left I went over to
Nordstrom and I got these three
eyeshadows I don't know where the
packaging went I try them on and I guess
I threw it away anyways they are all by
Bobbi Brown I have never used Bobbi
Brown's shadows before in my life and no
one has told me how amazed that they are
so I got three colors this is champagne
quartz and again I just like the NARS
one it's a really pretty all over
shimmer color this one is more of just a
perfect beige it's right here I love the
shade I own this one for about a week I
would say and I think I've already used
it two or three times I absolutely love
it then I got toast which is very
similar to Maximo silk but darker and
more pigment so it looks like that's I
really really love shades like this
because they're really beautiful to
blend in the crease this with makeup
geek
creme brulee is what I'm wearing in my
crease right now love this color if you
know me I will have like these literally
poop brown shades for my eyes and I'm
not trying to be disgusting but I'm
serious
I love like that mustardy Brown it's my
favorite so yes I absolutely love these
three shades from Bobby Brown for fall
gorgeous I got you a Nastasia clear brow
gel because I'm at the very bottom of
the barrel and I need it oh please
then I got philosophy peppermint stick
Body Wash oh my god everything in my
life is peppermint especially when the
holidays come around it's like
peppermint hands so peppermint body wash
peppermint candles peppermint lip gloss
peppermint toothpaste obviously I'm
obsessed with peppermint so oh we can't
talk about it it's so good and then last
but not least I got the Miss Dior
perfume this is the one in the pink
bottle I absolutely love it oh my gosh
this is not a day-to-day sent for me but
this is something that I would
definitely wear like on date night I
love it it smells so like just old
school romance if that makes sense
I don't know if I do the way I described
things are just unintelligent but it
smells really really good
so that is it for my collective haul I
really hope you guys enjoy as always
everything I mentioned will be down in
the description bar below including hair
makeup clothes and everything in between
so I love you guys forever thank you so
