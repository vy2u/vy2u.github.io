hey guys cover today's video I'm going
to be doing a makeup tutorial on this
look that you see right here I need to
come up with a different intro my
goodness gracious every single thing I
did meet me like it's been like almost
four years I think and I'm still doing
the same intro really Jacqueline I am
ridiculously obsessed with this makeup
look I'm trying so hard on to stare at
myself in the viewfinder and seem like a
total narcissist because every two
seconds I want to be like hmm I don't
remember the last time I loved a makeup
look as much as I love this one like
this like filled up my cup if you know
what I mean like I just feel like alive
with this makeup look on
and the reason I'm thumbing this
tutorial for you guys is because I was
wearing the same look a couple days ago
and I was on snapchat that day and I
went over to Twitter and I could not
believe how many requests there were
from you guys tweeting me to film this
makeup look for you guys so that is
exactly what I did you know how it works
your wish is my command that's how we do
it around here you shall be seen but I
did just kind of spice it up a little
bit I added lashes that are a little bit
more dramatic and I made my lower lash
line pop just a little bit more I just
feel like every time I do the same look
like a second time it gets better like
the first time I like it but the second
time I usually love it and keep that in
mind because if you try to look one time
and you're not like crazy in love give
it a second shock I feel like the more
you do something the more you can
perfect it like practice makes perfect
I'm saying so yes I am so in love with
this colorful liner trend
I know colorful liners are really in
every single spring and summer but this
year it's everywhere and brands have
been coming out with more colorful
liners which I just love so much I've
seen so many gorgeous looks with
colorful liners on Instagram there was
this one girl this is like a smoky black
eye with a white liner it was so
gorgeous I saw in the popular page um
Mannie he recently did a makeup look
using the same exact liner I think I
think it was the same exact liner a
couple weeks ago his look was much more
subtle in this so if you want to check
that out totally it's beautiful but yeah
I'm just I'm in love with this I really
wanted to a yellow liner I feel like a
yellow liner would be really fun and
different but I'm trying to think of how
it would work I think like a turquoise
like almost like seafoam Oh heavy
gorgeous like a yellow liner mm-hmm
I'm rambling I love this look and I hope
that you guys maybe get some inspiration
to jump outside of your comfort zone and
try something different like a weed
colorful liner because it's just so much
fun not to mention it's like fun for
everybody around you every single time
you blink it's like a nice surprise for
all of your friends and family so I hope
that you guys enjoy this video thanks
much for watching I love you and I'll
see you guys soon mmm bye please god no
I don't want to get glam I want to go
back to bed I'm just kidding okay I'm
going to start by priming my eyes I'm
using any concealer this is just the way
I prime it and I'm using a dry Beauty
Blender just to blend that out you can
use your finger a damn Beauty Blender a
brush it doesn't matter this is just the
way I prime my eyes it's what works for
me after I have my entire eyelid covered
with a thin amount of concealer I will
dust a little bit of powder over it a
translucent powder it can be like a
setting powder it doesn't matter just
anything to make it matte and first and
foremost I'm going to be going in with
makeup geek chickadee since we're going
to be going in with reds and corals and
kind of pinky shades today I wanted to
go in with chickadee first it is one of
my favorites all time colors for the
crease when I'm doing a warm smokey eye
and I am using a sigma e40 which is one
of my old E's but goodies it's a great
blending brush and as you can see I'm
bringing it all the way to the inner
corner to the outer corner and I'm
keeping it very low on the entire crease
area and then once I have basically no
products left as you see I bring up
basically all the way towards my brow
and that's how we get that really
seamless blending perfection look that
we want on the ice now I'm going to go
in with morphe fiesta this is a single
eyeshadow by morphe recently i unpackage
like every single morphe eyeshadow like
a couple weeks ago and put them in
palettes and so I've been kind of
dabbling around them more and more and
so I'm going to do the exact same thing
with this that I do with chickadee and
put it just directly over the first
color right there in my crease then I'm
going to reach for makeup geek Morocco I
don't know why I just discovered this
eyeshadow like why have I not been using
this every day of my life welcome home
mama you are now a part of the family
hello this I shadow is so gorgeous as
you can see I'm doing the exact same
thing and bringing this one down on my
lid a little bit more than the rest just
because I felt like it there wasn't
really no rhyme or reason I was just
having fun and I'm going to grab Mac red
brick I'm going to be honest you guys it
is not necessary to put on four
different shades of corals and orange
it is so totally not but just because
this is one of my favorite colors to
work with I wanted to utilize as many of
my shadows as possible but honestly you
can do this with two or three of the
shadows you do not need all of them I'm
grabbing a Nastasia burnt orange which
is such a beautiful kind of caramel
kamilly shade if you're like a docker
all complexion this would be such a
beautiful shade for your transition
right there and your crease for an
everyday color it's so gorgeous picking
up any other blending brush this is the
morphe m43 3 all I'm going to do is just
grab a little bit more of that makeup
geek Morocco and a Nastasia burnt orange
and just put a little bit more intense
and make it a little bit deeper in my
crease because I wanted just a little
bit more like pronunciation in the
crease area so then I'm going to pick up
the new Tarte clay pot waterproof liner
and this is in the shade mint and I'm
going to be applying this the exact same
way I would apply any regular basic
black liner except honey today we ain't
basic I want to make this pretty thick
honestly I felt like when I was done
with the entire look I was like I could
have made this wing even thicker you can
honestly go as thick and dramatic as you
want with this wing because it's already
such a fun bold look it'll just add to
it and girl if you're going to do it do
the damn thing right I have to of course
obsess over my wings to make sure
they're even because I'm not being funny
you guys it's not normal I'm such a
perfectionist with my makeup if my wings
aren't even I will literally wipe off my
makeup and just leave the house with no
makeup I'd rather have no makeup than
uneven liner because I am that I'm a
psychopath okay moving on
I'm coating my lashes with mascara to
make sure that I don't have any of that
eyeliner like stuck on it so that my
natural lashes blown with my fake lashes
really nicely and I'm going to be using
velour lashes and fluff and wispy these
are probably my number one or two
favorite dramatic lash I just think
they're so gorgeous and now I'm going to
move on to the face and I'm going to be
priming it using my favorite primer
right now which is the Becca backlight
priming filter it just gives such a
gorgeous radiance to the skin if you're
dry and you want radiance girl this
primer is bomb and then I'm going to
grab my L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
foundation and I'm going to take my
foundation brush like I just take it and
directly put it into the center of that
cushion I don't press really hard
because it can get full coverage really
quickly I press like halfway down and I
am using the morphe m4 3:9
to blend this out this is my all-time
favorite foundation brush ever ever ever
I've gone through a lot of obsessions
with a lot of foundation brushes and
this is my absolute number one I feel
like no matter what I try I always go
back to this guy right here and then I'm
going to pick up my favorite concealer
ever and this is the Urban Decay Naked
wait list concealer I'm gonna put this
on the entire under eye area and I know
it looks like it's a lot but that's
because it is I'm going to use a damp
Beauty Blender though and using the damp
Beauty Blender makes it so that even if
you apply too much concealer it will
pick up the excess and just make the
under eyes look so natural which is why
I have been die hard for a beauty
blender for like the past two years now
I'm going to grab the anastacio banana
powder I'm going to set my under eye
area I'm only using the banana powder
today and I'm not mixing with anything
else because I didn't want the under eye
to be too highlighted I didn't want it
to be too shiny or too radiant I just
wanted it to look really nice and soft
with the rest of the skin and now using
a fluffy brush I'm going to just apply a
sheer amount of powder no additional
coverage just wanting to kind of
slightly modify myself so I'm not super
duper dewy and then I'm going to go in
with ardency in liner in the shade lilac
oh these liners are my number one
favorite liners in the game they're so
creamy they stay so long on my inner
line and it kind of frustrated me
because you can't really see the color
popping on camera but in person this
color was gorgeous then I'm gonna grab
Mac deep damson this is a matte kind of
wine purpley shade and I'm going to take
a definer brush any definer brush
anything small and precise will do I'm
going to take it all the way from my
lower lashes where like my mint green
liner ends I'm going to bring it into
the inner corner and I'm going to stop
it where my lashes stop growing if that
makes sense and I'm going to pick up
another morphe single eyeshadow this is
in the shade magical magenta and I'm
going to overlay it right on top of deep
damn sinks I just felt like it was
looking just a little too basic and
typical over there and I wanted to
really brighten it up and make it a
little bit more fun because if we're
gonna do it we're gonna do it right like
I want this look to stand out and be
really colorful and different I'm going
to pick up just a little bit more of
that makeup geek Morocco and use it to
blend out that lower lash line this will
also help tie the entire look together
to bring some of that warm orange on the
lower lash as well now I'm going to go
in with Mac nylon my favorite brow
highlight inner corner highlight of all
time this has been a ride-or-die product
of mine legit since what mm oh my god
2005 it's been a while I'm gonna fill in
my brows using the Anastasia brow
definer today is full my favorites guys
I just calls my favorite product video
because this is my favorite brow product
ever like I don't think you understand
everybody in my life has this definer
now because I'm like wait a second
you're still using the brow Wiz oh come
on girl what are you living interlocked
like this is the most amazing brow
pencil of all time there's nothing like
it I'm just ridiculously dedicated so
let's just move past that we are going
to be doing a little contouring and I'm
going to be using benefit hoola bronzer
an oldie but a goodie I want to do an
updated contour video soon because I've
just been using so many different
brushes recently and the way I've been
doing it I've been making it much more
of an intense angle as far as from the
top of the ear to the corner of the lips
and then as always I am blending out the
forehead area just around the hairline
and making sure I don't get any product
in the center of the forehead or center
of the face because it will defeat the
contouring purpose all right now Mama's
gonna bake do you see how much powder
I'm using looks like it's snowing in
here do you see how I'm using the RCM a
no color powder to do a little bit of
baking while I apply at my blush and I'm
using one of the new Becca blushes in
the shade Tiger Lily they are very high
pigmented they are very shimmery very
frosty they're like similar to their
highlight formula but for a blush so I
use this coral shade to kind of tie the
eyes and the cheeks together and then on
top of it not necessary but I just felt
like a little bit of pink so I picked up
a little bit of Mac peeny petal and I'm
going to just put a little bit of that
right over top so I felt like it was a
little too coral on my cheeks and I was
like hmm again
not necessary I'm just extra and when
you have a big makeup collection you
want to use a lot you know what I'm
saying so you can totally pack blushes
on do more than one but it is not
necessary at all you guys I'm going to
go ahead and wipe away all that power
that I put down there but then I was
like wait a second I don't like the way
this area looks so I'm going to put just
a little bit more and I'll dust it off
in like a minute I'm going to grab some
of the Becca shimmering skin Perfector
in the shade opal on a morphe 501 brush
and I'm going to just highlight the tops
of my cheekbones I still love opal so
much
it's a good
cool tone highlight has like a little
bit of gray in it but it's just so
beautiful it really stands out in a
crowd I just love like the silver tones
in it I think it's really pretty I'm
going to coat my lower lashes with some
mascara I'm using the Kevin a qualm
mascara I love this one it's my mom's
favorite mascara and I've been using it
a lot recently again and I forgot how
much I loved it as well for lips I'm
going to use colour-pop BFF lippy stick
it's like a really pretty Orange II
Corley kind of pale terracotta has a
longer description of my life and then
for gloss I'm gonna go on with the Kylie
cosmetics lip gloss in a shade so cute
which is the palest of all her shades I
personally am NOT the biggest fan of
these glosses I don't hate them but I'm
not quite cry about them you know you
know I'm sayin okay you know I'm saying
but I really like this lip combination I
think it looks super super pretty you
know me I love a good nude and then just
because I want to do a little something
extra I'm going to take a little bit of
brown shadow and just put it on my lower
lip area just to give a natural contour
to make my lips look a little bit fuller
and pouty ER and then use a little bit
of clear brow gel so that these babies
stay in place and that completes this
look I hope you guys enjoyed thanks for
watching love you see you soon bye I
can't even begin to tell you did you
hear that inhale mom was allergies are
not cute right now but I'm trying to
think of how to make that work then once
a week since I've had wine I deserve a
glass of wine me me me nude
