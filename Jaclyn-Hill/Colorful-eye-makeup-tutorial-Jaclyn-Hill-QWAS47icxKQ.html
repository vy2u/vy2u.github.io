wearing to Grandma's I mean I wear to my
grandma's but you know we're on we're on
good terms so once again I beat the
light
I wouldn't apologize the lighting in
this video is not good it was like oh my
god that girl did a lot of damage today
there Searson girl walking through my
parking lot right now with probably like
15 shopping bags in her hand like
so today as you can see I am doing a
very colorful eyelid tutorial I am doing
a piece I have gotten so so many
requests from you guys asking me to do a
colorful eye look now I did the purple
one but I believe it's the only one I've
done and plus purple even though it's
color it's not like colors you know it's
a general color and a lot of people wear
purple smokey eyes purple tones so this
is different even though smokey eyes and
evening looks and Kim Kardashian makeup
tutorials are fun you know this is also
fun and even though it's not something
you're going to be wearing every single
day it's still something for occasions
you know like going on vacation or
festivals or concerts or the beach
whatever you know it's fun and I'm using
complementary colors here I have on
orange tones and blue tones are
complementary to each other I don't know
how to find out colors that are
complementary to each other all you do
is look at the RGB color wheel you can
type it in online look at it and
whatever is opposite from the color it's
complementary color so blue is opposite
of orange so orange and blue complement
each other and read its opposite from
green so red and green complement each
other and so on so forth so in this I
have orange tones and blue tone just
complement each other and then also blue
complements rise and orange complements
light eyes like green and blue so this
is basically gonna look good on
everybody so I tried to like work with
it and help you guys out so everybody
can wear this you just have to have the
confidence to do it I hope you enjoy
this and I hope you try it let me know
what you think
and comment below and don't forget to

first thing I am doing is taking
expensive pink this is a curly pinky
shade with gold undertones it looks
beautiful on every skin tone from warm
to neutral to cool it really flatters
everybody it's a great shade and it is
smooth as butter so I'm taking it and
I'm packing it all over my lid you can
put it in as literally as you want I'm
not doing anything too precise right now
this color I'm just bringing it up as
far as I want in the inner corner and on
the outer corner as well because I'm
going to be going in with shades to
blend this out and next I'm going to
take Samoas silk instead of taking soft
Brown like I normally do I'm using this
color because it's more yellowy and soft
Brown would not really complement these
colors right now so I am just tossing it
back and forth from inner corner to
outer corner as you can see I'm doing it
pretty sloppy there's really no rhyme or
reason to it because this is going to be
very fluffed out now I'm taking coral by
Mac this is a Mac Pro shade but you can
still get it if you don't have a pro
card and it's matte and it's very
pigmented so I'm just going to take a
tiny bit and I'm just going to dab on
the outer corner of my eye and then
that's it just walk away from it now I'm
taking copper ring this is a gorgeous
copper shade if you want to branch out
with colors and you don't know where to
start
I suggest copper ring by Mac because
it's beautiful on brown eyes and light
eyes pale skin and dark skin it is
gorgeous oh my gosh so I'm putting it on
my outer corner and I'm just dabbing it
really low to my lashline and then
bringing it up into that crease so just
start at the lashes and push it in there
because you really want it to be the
most pigmented in the lower lash line in
that outer corner so once I have that I
just go in with my fluffy brush again
and toss it back and forth now I'm going
to take rule which as you can see is a
true orange color you do not have to do
this but I am because the orange earth
at this look is the more complementary
it's going to be to the blues I'm going
to put on underneath of my eyelid so
then I'm going to take painterly
paint-pot and I'm going to prime the
bottom part of my lash line and I'm
doing this because I'm gonna go in with
colors down there and I don't want any
of that to move by the way it's raining
so I'm sorry if you can hear that right
now okay I'm taking chrome yellow which
as you can see is a yellow as can be and
I'm
going to dab this in my inner corner and
a v-shape but make sure when you're
doing that v-shape you go up on that
upper lid and blend it into that
expensive pink don't just stop make sure
you bring it up there and blend those
two colors together okay now I am taking
surf USA this was a limited edition
color but I just grabbed it because it
was right near me but um Maybelline
Color tattoos also has a shade that's
basically this exact same color Urban
Decay has some I believe L'Oreal has
some so this is not a hard shade to find
since I'm using a limited edition but as
you can see I'm just putting it in my
lashline as tightly as possible bringing
out towards that outer corner then I'm
going to take shimmer Moss this is a
shade by Mac and it's more light than
the color I just used and it has more
shimmer in it so I'm going to take this
and put it in my inner corner very
tightly as you can see on top of that
yellow putting it on top of that yellow
is going to create a greenish shade so
it's going to be from green to light
blue to dark blue and I want that
transition and like that fade and going
on there okay as you can see I put on my
eyeliner and I winged it out and then I
took my brush and I just put that blue
right underneath of it and now I'm just
blackening up my eyeliner even more I'm
just showing you what to do because once
you get the liner on sometimes it can be
like okay this awkward the blue and the
orange aren't connected so yeah just put
on the liner and let that be the line in
between the blue and the orange on the
outer corner if that makes any sense I'm
sure it does okay now I'm going to take
NYX glitter liner this is in actually I
don't know the shade it's something Jade
I'll put it in the description box below
but I put a couple of coats of this I
put it on all the way in that very inner
corner over top of that shimmer ma shade
and I drag it out about 3/4 of the way
and then I loosen up my hand once I get
to the center of my eye
okay I'm using Pro Longwear foundation
by Mac in shade NC 40 but I'm not
showing you do my foundation cuz I'm
going to be making a video on that soon
and I just think it's pointless I'm
taking Mac's Mac Pro actually they're
accentuating powder and I'm highlighting
my under eye area with this very lightly
I'm not doing a intense highlight by any
means today this is very very lightly
done but I'm taking a bronzer that's mat
just a few shades darker than me it's
not really dark because my eyes are so
in
hence that I want to leave the rest of
my face very neutral so I'm contouring
lightly with this and as you can see
it's not dark I don't want to give
myself that bronze look I'm going under
the hollows of my cheek bones and I'm
just going to bring it up on the side of
my face very lightly blend out so you
don't have any harsh lines because I
don't want this to be noticeable and
then I'm going to take cantaloupe I've
been obsessing over this blush I've
owned it for like a year or two but
recently I'm just I've fallen in love
with it all over again so I am taking
that and putting just on the apples of
my cheeks dragging it up blending it
into my bronzer a little bit sorry
that's my husband walking around the
background it kind of creeped me out for
a second but it's okay I'm showing a
very blurry shot with me to do my
mascara as you can see the camera was
not cooperating but I just wanted to
show you that I did do it and then I
made a boo-boo and I got on my face and
I had to clean up with a q-tip if you
wait just like 30 seconds when you get
mascara on your face and you swipe it
with a q-tip it comes right off but if
you do it immediately it'll take off
your makeup so wait and let it dry now
I'm just using a neutral lip color I
will put it in the description box below
and after that you're all done so I hope
you enjoyed and thank you so much for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
