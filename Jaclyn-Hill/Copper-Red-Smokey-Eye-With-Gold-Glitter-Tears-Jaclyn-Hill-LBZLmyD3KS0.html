I'll be honest I will be perfectly okay
being buried in this makeup look like
honestly a blown out red smokey eye
gold glitter and a glossy pale nude lip
like Chuck please put a fork in my bitch
ass I'm done
oh I'm so happy to be here feel nameless
look I know people are probably gonna
say oh my god all you know how to do is
I ride smokey eye so what if that's all
I know how to do at least it's something
that I like I'm seriously so excited I
feel like I can't move my arms because
this is like restricting me I don't
think I could ever wear this for a very
long period of time because I think
anything I can't I know why I'm really
excited about this metaphor I can't like
lift up my arms otherwise said Moran no
seriously I have been wanting to do this
look for over a month now at this point
but as you guys know I was gone from
YouTube for three weeks
and then I mean my chit chat video I'm
finally sitting down doing this look and
not only have I wanted to film this look
but I've actually wanted to wear this
look like I have just been in the mood
I've just been craving a good just hot
fiery ready orange a smoky eye light and
I was so excited to sit down I just feel
this and just feed my soul fill up my
cup bitch and that's what I'm doing I
don't even really know what to call like
this bottom glitter technique I've been
seeing it all around I saw in a magazine
I saw a couple videos on YouTube I've
seen on Instagram I don't really know
what the technique is but hey when it's
glitter its glitter it doesn't matter
how it's applied like just throwing on
your face and like you'll be fabulous I
when I first saw it though I was kind of
like didn't know what to make of it I
was like what are they doing and then I
was like girl you better check yourself
and get right with the Lord because you
are not going to be hating on anyway the
glitter is applied like I'm always kind
of reluctant to like new trends and new
things I'm like no then like a week
later I'm like yeah end of the day if
you have glitter on your body then
you're doing it right like in my book it
does not matter how or where you have
glitter like if you were to flash me and
you just end litter all over your
nipples I said yeah I know that I read
smoky eye can be intimidating to people
I know that it has become a lot more
on-trend than it used to be but for
those of you who are kind of intimidated
by or like oh my god it's gonna make me
look
I have the flu don't be intimidated just
try out with whatever you have at home
it's honestly so flattering
pale skin dark skin all of skin medium
skin light eyes dark eyes brown eyes
like it really is flattering sometimes
got to kind of find your tone but yeah
if you do decide to step outside the box
or maybe you're a girl or a boy who
absolutely loves warm red smokey eyes
and you try it out you get inspired by
this look please make sure that you tag
me on Instagram or tweet it to me I
would absolutely love love to see your
recreations because nothing makes me
happier and then a red smokey eye and
glitter and avocado I know that has
nothing to do with it I'm just saying
like when I think about the things make
me happiest in life I've got a throw
avvocato in there I'm done I love you
guys so much thank you for watching this
video and I will see you guys soon hello
oh my gosh you guys I am so excited
about this makeup tutorial okay anyways
I am priming my face as you can see and
I'm using the girl on primer which I've
been obsessing over the past month or so
then for foundation I'm going to go in
with the hourglass vanish stick
foundation which has been my absolute
fave go-to for the past couple months I
actually got to start switching it up
because it's getting a little redundant
it's like enough Jacqueline we get it
you like the foundation moving on my
goodness I am using two different shades
right now I'm using golden which is very
yellow base and I'm using warm beige
which is a little bit more like a
neutral pinky shade because I did just
get a spray tan so I have to kind of go
back and forth with different shades to
match me when I'm more tan and then when
I lose my spray tan and I'm more fair
for concealer I'm using oh my gosh the
Tarte shaped tape which honestly you
guys holy guacamole
we are in a full-on committed
relationship at this point and I have to
say I've never been happier this
concealer is mom absolutely mom if
you're looking for a concealer right now
and you're teeter-tottering back and
forth I very highly recommend the Tarte
shape tape now for my under eyes I'm
going to use the same damp Beauty
Blender and I'm going to apply the RCM a
no color transfer scent powder it does
not give me a white cast and it goes on
very sheer very easy to apply which is
why it's my favorite and it's not too
drying then for my powder I'm going to
go in with the Mac mineralize skinfinish
and a gigantic brush I'll have this
brush so much for powder kits like the
size of my head so it's very quick
application then for eyes I'm going to
start off with makeup geek chickadee
which if you've been around for a while
you know
Earl this is my favorite it makes me
feel all warm and fuzzy inside I'm going
to be using an m4 for one long-haired
blending brush by Moore sorry morphe I'm
speeding this up so that you can see how
much I actually blend this initial color
into my crease transition area I'm going
to start right in the crease and then as
you can see I blend up towards the brow
at the end it's important to really
blend out that initial shade otherwise
everything else will look messy so take
your time on that first shade I'm going
to grab an e 47 by morphe which is that
brush that I used to carve that out with
the same RCM a translucent powder I'm
going to create the shape that I want my
eye shadow to be that way if I have
fallout I can wipe it away and this is
going to give it that desire effect it's
kind of the exact same thing as using
tape that I've kind of discovered except
you can do it over top of your
foundation and it won't ruin it when you
brush it away everything will disappear
and you'll have beautiful clean shadow
so I'm using makeup geek Morocco on that
exact same brush which is a more orangie
terracotta I'm going to put that in
outer corner I'll go to the inner corner
and blend it upward now I'm gonna go in
with my favorite oh my god this Geller
just gives me so many warm feels on the
inside of the zombie on a ball and I'm
going to be using the M 4-3-3 blending
brush from morphe to apply this and this
is from melt cosmetics and it's from the
dark matter stack I believe it's called
and it's in the shade enigma
don't worry I'll put it down below I
know that was a mouthful I'll put a down
below for you guys I am putting this
generously on the inner corner and the
outer corner I'm not worrying about the
lid because I'm going to cover that up
with a frosty or shade I'm gonna put the
exact same amount of the inner corner as
I am on the outer and then as you can
see right here I'm kind of slightly
blending it outward to kind of give a
more cat eye like whoosh effect I wish
you could see the movement I doing with
my hand I'm going whoosh back towards my
temple I want that air ballon whoosh
effect then I'm going to pick up a
little bit more of that Morocco just to
warm it up and give it a little bit more
of an orange e vibes I didn't want to be
that too purplish-red I really wanted to
be kind of like a brick red and I've
discovered this brush recently I mean I
haven't discovered it I've started using
it a lot and I love it and it's the m-44
one by morphe and it's amazing light
tight precision and it applies a
generous amount so you can really get in
there I've been loving it I'm going to
apply more of that translucent powder
right underneath my eye with a dip damp
Beauty Blender again because I'm going
to go in with Anastasia henna
and this is a really really pigmented
frosty orange shade and it does have
fallout so I wanted to put that
underneath of my eye in case it gets
really messy I will not have orange
eyeshadow all over my face
I did wet my brush with fix+ that way it
would apply a lot smoother because a lot
of times these really foiled frosty
shadows do not apply nicely just being
honest without fix+
so that's why I spray my brush first I'm
going back in with that exact same
orange red color I'm just making sure
that I don't have any harsh lines on the
outer side of my eye making sure it's
all totally blended and I'm going to
grab a brush and just hopeful blow this
all away and you can see how my eye
shadow looks nice and clean no fallout
whatsoever and I have that desired shape
that I was going for I'm gonna take that
exact same Morocco shade I'm only using
like three or four shades for this
entire look and I'm just putting it all
over my entire eye as you can see it's
very easy with a pencil brush I'm going
to connect it to the outer corner of my
eye and bring it all the way in to the
inner corner I'm not going to stop
before the inner tear-duct I'm going to
bring this color all the way into that
unit enter tear duct of my eye I'm gonna
go back in with melt cosmetics enigma
and I'm with a more defined brush I'm
gonna put this really really tight on
the lower lash line to really make it
red bring this down like as low as you
want the more you buff it out honestly
on this look the prettier it'll look
like I just love a huge blown out smoky
eye almost wish that I brought it down
lower like you can bring this down to
your cheek bone if you wanted I'm
chewing a milk dud right now just so you
guys know I was craving chocolate you
know how it goes I'm going to use a
little bit of some black gel liner with
a tiny little brush I'm going to apply
this on my inner waterline I've just
been using gel liner recently instead of
a Kohl liner because I feel like it's
kind of easier to be quite honest and
then I'm going to be going in with the
Anastasia brow definer and ever since I
dyed my hair dark I have been using the
shade chocolate Chocolat
ah I wish I pronounced alike that is so
much fancier instead of what shade did I
even use before I don't remember caramel
I've been using chocolate because it
matches my hair I'm going to be applying
velour lashes in fluff in wispy and then
I'm going to be going in with some
bronzer I'm using the makeup forever
waterproof bronzer which is one of my
favorites it applies so beautifully it's
got like a little bit of a kind of satin
dewy effect but it doesn't give you
shimmer or glitter to the face it just
looks so natural like if you're going to
be outside
I'd or like at the beach at the pool or
just in direct sunlight it's such a
beautiful bronzer because it's not
powdery at all it applies like a dream
and just looks extremely natural then
I'm going to use some clear brow gel I'm
gonna set my brow hairs because you know
how that situation goes if I forget to
do this it's a hot mess all day long I'm
taming my brows constantly I'm like down
girls down girls because they just they
go cray cray
without the taming then for the glitter
on the lower lashline I'm going to use
Midnight Cowboy which is the shade and
it's by Urban Decay so it's the urban
decay heavy-metal glitter and it's in
the shade urban cowboy I'm literally
just gonna draw like a V as you can see
I'm just kind of going for it I'm kind
of just going in the middle of my iris
and just kind of bringing it down on a V
going back and forth going up and down
I'm gonna keep piling it on wait ten
seconds for it to kind of dry and add
some more it's a really different
technique a different way to wear
glitter but I think it's so cool for
like a girls night out or whatever I
would wear this on a Tuesday let's get
real I'm going to be highlighting my
face and I'm using the Make Up For Ever
Pro Lite fusion in the shade 0-2 and I'm
going to just pop that on the tops of my
cheekbones I just felt like it wasn't
enough I wanted to go a little crazy so
I picked up my champagne pop what's new
plopped it right on top just to give it
a little bit more of a pop haha get it
champagne pop no that's actually why I
named it champagne pop because I thought
of it as like the champagne color that's
a pop of highlight on your cheek for my
lips I'm going to be using the Anastasia
liquid lip in the shade and naked a
really beautiful pale kind of peachy
nude and then I'm going to go over top
of that with NARS lip gloss in the shade
Chelsea's girls such a gorgeous color
it's like a nice again pale kind of
pinky peachy nude and after you do that
the look is complete so I hope you guys
enjoy this thank you so much for
watching I love you and I'll see you
guys soon
boom
I saw at one point like glitter vaginas
or something we're like becoming a trend
and at first I was like what thought I
was like hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
