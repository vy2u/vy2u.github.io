video all about highlighting and
contouring with cream products and I'm
so excited to be doing this video
because I have been going through a very
intense obsession recently with
highlighting and contouring with cream
products there's a lot of benefits to
cream contouring and highlighting first
of all if you have dry skin it's going
to be a huge plus for you because powder
sometimes does not work on people with
dry skin because it can grab onto little
patches it's very hard to blend if
you're extremely dry so creams are
always gonna work for those of you who
have dry skin also the number one thing
that I personally love about cream
contour and highlighting is no matter
what type of skin you have skin tone
skin color anything it's in my opinion
as person going to look the most natural
so before jumping into the actual demo
of this video I actually just want to
give you guys suggestions and my
recommendations of my favorite cream
contours that way you guys don't want to
use the exact same method that I used
today or the exact same products you
have suggestions for some other ones
that I think very highly of and would
recommend to anybody this is like my
baby this is like my favorite product
the entire world and this is the Chanel
Soleil ten-day shannon i don't mind for
quite a few years when i first bought it
i was like oh you better be good because
it's so expensive and it has been worth
every single penny you can see that
there's like a little dent in it but for
the most part like i am still so good i
feel this is gonna last me another year
before i have to replace it which is
crazy because I've already owned it for
a couple of years and I've used it so
much this is beautiful for just bronzing
the face broadening the entire face this
has to be probably my favorite ever
contour cream bronze shade ever on the
market the Bobbi Brown
what is this technically this is
technically a Bobby Brown foundation
stick but I call it the Bobbi Brown
contour stick you can get this in any
shady one because it is a foundation
stick there's a wide range of colors so
if you're someone who likes more of like
a grey more kind of Ashley cool tone
colored you would not want to use the
color that I have because this is golden
6 which is a very golden shade I
typically when I use this I will use it
to kind of oh my gosh I was dropping I
was like no I
we'll typically use this on my entire
cheek area just kind of bronze and warm
up the face this is more of a summertime
thing for me but again you can get in
any color to do whatever you desire and
it just blends so beautifully it's nice
and pigmented very full coverage so it's
ideal for that plus you have it in a
stick form so you can really carve
everything out as you go this is an
oldie but a goodie oh my gosh when I was
freelancing and hustling this was like
my go-to for everything and this is just
a small palette this is the graftobian
what is this the graftobian high def
glamour cream palette this isn't the
shape warm but this isn't technically
like what I'm talking about I'm just
talking about the graftobian foundations
in general
I can't link some of them down below if
you guys want so that you can check them
out for yourself but I have like the
actual big palettes like with every
single color that they sell and that's
what I used to use for brides that's
readies for contour highlights so forth
sorry I'm having a hard time speaking
because I'm talking about thousand miles
an hour these are just absolutely
beautiful they are so creamy so
pigmented these blend out like a dream
so if you're looking for something that
is just like so easy so simple and have
more than one shade I would try one of
these out and if you want it for contour
you might want to go with a neutral
shade or even the cool shade you can get
it in this little one right here and you
can get five colors from light to dark
they're just ideal for cream contour and
highlight last but not least we have the
new Anastasia of Beverly Hills cream
contour and highlight kick I really
recommended this to mainly someone with
oilier skin this is a dream come true
for some with oily skin because this is
a drier formulation so it's not going to
be as easy to blend out as the other one
but the pro about that is if you have
very oily skin and everything breaks up
and everything kind of starts moving
down on you this won't do that
this will stay in place this will lock
all day long if you are more on the dry
side I would recommend mixing an oil
with it
I don't you guys know who Manny is here
on YouTube anyways him and I were
texting when we first got these pallets
in and I was telling him like you know
it's a little bit dry and on he was like
I'm gonna mix it with oil and I was like
stop that's
do it right now - it was so quickly both
thought of the exact same thing at the
exact same time and we both love it so
just mixing a little drop of beauty oil
with this and then on the face you can
use like vitamin E oil argan oil eggs
whatever you want mixing this with an
oil will then make it ideal for those of
you who are more dry and you just want
something really creamy and blendable so
the Anastasia cream contour and
highlight kit so I do not have any
foundation or makeup on my skin right
now I only have my eye shadow and like
my lashes done but I haven't done my
brows or my skin so I'm gonna go do that
off of camera really quick because you
guys have seen me do it 500 times okay
I'm back I just got done applying
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
and honestly it does not matter what
liquid foundation you use as long as it
is a liquid just keep in mind that you
always have to do liquids first and then
set with a powder you cannot do cream
contour and highlight if you use powder
foundation because again liquids and
creams always have to go first and then
a powder I also suggest starting off
with moisturize skin because we're going
to go in with creamy products it's
always good to have moisturize skin when
you're applying your foundation and make
everything look much more useful dewy in
supple and radiant but especially we're
gonna be working with lots of creams
make sure you are moisturized so I'm
going to conceal my under eye area area
using Mac Pro Longwear concealer in nw20
and NW 25 and then using my clean ring
finger I'm going to apply this
underneath my eye area and my inner
corner down the side of my nose and I'm
going to go upward back towards the
temple the shape that you choose to make
with your under-eye concealer is really
important because in the end of this
entire process this is going to really
give you the face shape that you
personally are desiring I like that kind
of lifted look with my highlighting
contour that's why I bring this down
dramatically right here to my smile line
and then I bring it up towards the
temple because in the end that's going
to give me that really kind of lifted
oval face you can do whatever you want
though because that's really what this
is all about is using cream contour and
highlight to really manipulate the face
we're going to make some things pop
we're going to make some things recede
but more than anything we're going to
give ourself the face shape that we
personally desire so that is why I am
going in with this triangular motion and
bringing this upward I am just using a
damp Beauty Blender to just blend all
this out this is my favorite tool for
blending out
i concealer it's just like such a dream
and it's so easy I personally bring back
my concealer all the way back towards my
temple and I'm not afraid to get very
close to my hairline that's because I do
not have like a wide face right here if
some of you have like a really wide
intense cheekbone right up here and
you're wider in this area and you want
that to be more receding you don't stick
out as much you're not going to
highlight like I am you're going to want
to take your concealer and stop it like
right here and then you're going to
contour in this area to bring it more in
but because I kind of want this part to
look lifted and elevated and pop up more
that's why I'm bringing my highlight
further back so the first thing that I'm
going to use is the contour stick by
Smashbox this is part of their
step-by-step contour stick collection
I'm going with the contour shade I'm
literally going to carve out the
contours of my base so the rule that I
always live by is going from the top of
the ear to the corner of the lip that is
typically on your face going to be your
desired line so right here is where we
want to make the darkest line and then
blend out from there make sure you do
not bring it all the way to the corner
of your lip though otherwise you're
going to have a very intense non
natural-looking contour you want to
bring it about half way and then blend
out from there another tip that I to
give a lot of people is if you do not
have like what I call baby cheeks where
you have like a nice ball cheek gretna
side of your face but you want to have
that desired face shape what you can do
is you can kind of curve this out and
round it like that and it will kind of
look like it's cupping your cheek and
once you've blended that out and that
kind of rounded motion it'll give you
that more desired rounded cup face so
now I'm going to go and I'm going to
blend this contour out you can use any
brush that has synthetic hairs on it but
synthetic hairs are so extremely
important when blending out any cream
products because they're not going to
steal your product from you you're not
going to make you blotchy and they're
just going to really blend everything
out nice and smoothly without getting
any harsh lines you sort of work in kind
of quick motions back and forth same way
you would blend your eyeshadow you kinda
want to go back and forth and then in
circular motions
and as you can see I'm kind of cupping
the apple of my cheek the eye on my
cheek is right here and we're going to
kind of cut this when we come into the
inner portion because that's going to
give us that desired cheek look now if
you had a square face you would not want
to contour just like this if you had a
square face you would want to take lines
and now draw downward at this point and
contour that entire area in my friend
who has a very very round face I'm
hoping to get him on camera sometime
soon and use her as a model so I can
show you guys how I would work with
contouring and highlighting and liner
all that jazz for someone with a round
face that's my hope but until then eyes
kind of give you tips along the way
and I'm going to go up and I'm going to
my forehead I'm going to start with a
line right here and I'm going to bring
that line and taper it downward like
this if you have a large forehead or if
you think you have a large forehead and
you want to make it look smaller you can
bring these lines down as far as you
want but I am just going to bring them
down a little bit just for definition
because I don't feel like I really want
to like make my hairline come down I
just want to do this to even everything
out
I'm going to contour my nose I'm going
to take this exact same contour stick
I'm going to make two lines on each side
of my nose
I personally do not contour my nose
often because I feel like sometimes it
can actually do more harm than good I
personally have my nose broken when I
was 13 years old so because of that is
crooked I don't like doing anything to
bring attention to it so I really have
to take my time when I'm contouring I
can't just slap it on there like someone
with a perfectly straight nose could
because I have to really go in there
make some contouring certain areas make
sure highlighting certain areas to not
accentuate the crookedness of the broken
nose and make the situation even worse
it already is I am using a sigma
precision round P 82 brush to blend this
out
I always connect it with the inner part
of the brow that will give you the most
natural contour I make sure that I bring
it downward towards the side of the nose
why do I feel like I have to have a
mouth hanging open in order to do this
so now that I've done that I absolutely
have to go back in and highlight when
I'm done contouring my nose because this
contour is kind of makes my nose look a
little muddy and dirty and so
highlighting it is going to be absolute
key so now that we are contoured and we
have some Brown all over our face we're
going to go in and highlight which is
actually my favorite step because this
is a step that brings everything
together it's like oh so now I'm going
to go with a highlighting stick and what
I'm going to do this time is instead of
going in that area where we were before
with the contour I'm going to go maybe
like a half an inch below that I'm going
to create a very intense line so now I'm
also going to take that color and I'm
going to start bringing it up from here
to that smile line area that's what I
call it is I very predominant smile line
but what can I say I'm a happy person
I'm going to go in with my damp Beauty
Blender again because this is my
favorite way to blend this out and I'm
just going to start blending it and I'm
going to kind of be rolling it down in a
downward motion we're going to take this
highlight up to the corner of the nose
you're going to see this it's going to
create a very sharp right here because
we're cutting off that contour shape
that we had then it's okay because
you're going to kind of roll and press
to blend all that out so that this isn't
too harsh I'm going to go in the center
of the forehead or right above the
bridge of the nose and I'm going to kind
of draw like a little flower or at least
a plant or something
and then I'm going to blend that out as
well I'm going to use my foundation
brush to blend this out just because
it'd be faster than a beauty blender but
a beauty blender would work just fine
now I'm going to take a strike right
down the center of my nose to highlight
the bridge of my nose and I don't blend
out the highlight that I put in the
center of my nose because I don't want
to kind of move it and make it go over
the edge and ruin the contour that we
did so I just kind of DAB up and down
and kind of press it into the skin I'm
going to take that highlight and also go
right on my Cupid's bow from the center
of my lip up to my nose and then I'm
also going to create a cross right here
on my chin if you have a chin that you
feel is too big or you have something
about your chin that you don't like you
wouldn't want to highlight this area
obviously instead what I would suggest
is you contour right here on the bottom
of the chin pretty intensely and just
kind of blend it upward and that will
help kind of recede the chin if you feel
like it sticks out too much I'm going to
take the contour and I'm going to go
right underneath my lip just lightly
like that and then I'm going to blend
that down just with my finger and I want
the majority of this product to be right
in the center the lip going downward
this is going to give us a powder fuller
bottom lip so to finish all this off I'm
going to go in with the contour stick
one more time and I'm just going to
create a little bit of a shadow right
here on the bottom of my jaw I'm going
to blend all this out this will just
help give us more of a structured jaw
it's really important to go right back
here behind that ear area because if you
ever see in like a magazine you'll see
it those beautiful profile shots of
those models and their jaw super strong
of course we're working with a lot of
photoshop but before the Photoshop the
artist was contouring this area nice and
hard right back here okay so now we are
done with the cream portion of
highlighting and contouring as you can
see so just to finish this look off I'm
going to set everything with powder this
is just important otherwise it can kind
of move and break up you know on the
move and break up
I personally am dry so I a lot of times
won't set my contour because I don't
need to but on a lot of people the cream
products will tend to move so you may
want to set it because I never set my
under I consider to begin with you might
want to go out there Beauty Blender
still damp and just
to buff this out in case that under-eye
concealer has began to crease it all I'm
going to take a sigma tapered
highlighting brush this is an f-35 I'm
going to mix a Nastasia banana shade
with mac pro emphasize because if you
guys know me you know that these are my
writer guys and this is going to
highlight us even a tiny bit more than I
already am in this under-eye area I'm
going to grab my favorite contour
palette which is the Kat Von D shade
light palette has contour and lighten
shades and I'm going to take this middle
ground one right here on the Kat Von D
contour brush oh I have to sneeze but
huh oh there's another one
there you have it now that my eyes are
red and super irritated I'm going to
take the middle shade right here and I'm
going to just lightly blend this upward
and we're just kind of setting
everything so that nothing moves but
also if there's any blotchiness or
imperfections in the blending this was
kind of help blend everything together
even more so now I'm going to take this
highlight color on the opposite end of
the brush from this kat von d palette
what I'm going to do is just take that
and go right underneath in that contour
from before and just make a line just
like this I'm going to take that same
highlight color that I'm already about
to hit pan on because I love it so much
I'm going to dab a little bit of it in
the center of my forehead and then I
move it on the center of my chin and I'm
going to take it on a much smaller
blending brush that same highlight shade
and put a little bit on the center of my
nose
oh my god don't use these do alright let
me just finish off my make it really
quick and I'll be right back okay so I
just finished off my makeup I filled in
my eyebrows I did my lower lashline I
use a Mac Melba blush on my cheeks and
so now just to finish everything off I'm
going to go in and just highlight on my
cheekbone area and I'm going to actually
be mixing two highlighters it's so not
necessary but I own them both so I just
want to have fun and mix them I'm going
to mix both Becca opal and backup
moonstone together to create a really
beautiful color I'm going to be using my
favorite highlighting brush at the
moment which is the morphe and the 501 I
love this brush and I'm going to drag
this color right on the tops of my cheek
bone alright you guys so that completes
this tutorial how to demo that we just
did not really sure what to call it but
we are done and now you can see the
finished product I will move my face
around so you can see the lines and the
highlights that we've created all over
the face I know it seems like it's a lot
of steps and that's because it is this
is not something that I typically do on
a daily basis just because it's very
tedious and it's going to take a little
bit more time than I would like to spend
when I do my makeup on the everyday
occasion this is something that I do
when I want to go the extra mile and get
the extra glam factor on my face
happening day to day I will use the
Chanel bronzer with a sigma f84 kabuki
I'll swirl this in there I'll do my
cheeks forehead and then what I'll do is
I'll go in with these Smashbox highlight
stick and I'll carve it out like I did
earlier today and I'm done that is my
every day cream bronzing highlighting
routine because it's so easy to take
sixty Seconds I've got it down and it
just looks so natural and if you guys
are curious as to how this looks in
person because I know that sometimes you
can watch a video and did it okay that
looks great but let's talk about how it
looks
face to face it can be a different story
I would be totally honest with you I
have a very high HD camera you are going
to see all my imperfections as for what
it is
this is going to look the exact same
person that it does on camera the only
thing I didn't say that's a difference
is that for some reason my camera picks
up my highlight very gritty I don't know
why but my highlight always is kind of
chunky on this camera where a person it
looks really smooth and soft but the key
to is to start off with a very sheer
thin layer
Foundation and build from there you
start with a thick layer of foundation
you're going to build more creams and
it's going to look like frosting by the
end so you want to start off with a more
sheer layer of foundation and you
typically would when you're going with
powders because you're going to be
building and by the end result you're
going to have more coverage than you
started with so yeah that's that let me
know what else you guys would like to
see in the comments down below if you
want to see any more contouring and
highlighting videos I can do another one
for you that's a different technique if
you guys would like to see it or I could
do kind of like my everyday routine
which is what I'm sadly wearing right
now but with the Chanel bronzer you let
me know what you guys want to see and
I'll totally be ready in the comments
and taking your suggestions I love you
guys you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
