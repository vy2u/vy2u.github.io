I'm going to be doing a super-duper
chill everyday makeup look it is a
Tuesday casual Tuesday hashtag casual AF
I'm gonna be running to the grocery
store grab a sub sandwich I gotta take
my dog to the groomer so let's get
started oh my god okay as you guys can
clearly tell I'm correlative ill if you
can't tell who I am and I did a really
really really bad job I have been really
excited to film this video like you have
no idea I don't know what it is about
karela bill first of all I do know what
it is it's Glenn Close Glenn Close as
Cruella De Vil is just amazing
everything she's such an amazing actress
I don't what it is about Disney Villains
they're just so freakin hot I want to be
all of them I just think they're so
fierce so gorgeous so anyway there's not
really much to say about this look other
than this is my version of Cruella De
Vil I wanted to kind of modernize and
glam her out because even though she is
so fierce that movie was made a while
ago so I kind of wanted to like update
it and make it very glam I threw some
glitter in that crease because I figured
hello Carlinville nowadays I know should
be rockin some glitter let's get real I
actually wasn't gonna highlight for a
MINIX I felt like you know what I feel
like Carell is kind of matte and then
also who the hell do I think I am so I
bust out my high line brush real quick
and went in hard I just feel like I
could talk with my hands these gloves I
feel like a bit yes darling yes I need
you to like never I'm gonna I'm done I
love you so much thank you for watching
and I'll see you guys soon and happy
Halloween
what bye hey guys I am seriously so
excited to be filming this tutorial
today I mean I think it's pretty obvious
but I'm just saying I'm going to start
off with the makeup geek eyeshadow in
the shade beaks ale and I'm going to
grab a long hair fluffy brush this is a
natural bristle and this is the m44 one
by morphe and i'm going to take that
first shade and just dust it in the
entire upper crease of my eye as you can
see I'm totally avoiding my lid because
we are going to be doing a cut crease
today so I'm going to stick right there
in the crease and blend up towards the
brow so gently and so lightly then I'm
going to pick up a little bit of makeup
geek creme brulee this is an oldie but a
goodie for me it is my all-time favorite
transition color ever it blends out any
shade on my skin tone so beautifully
it's my secret weapon to just a flawless
blended eye so I'm going to take that
color and just do the exact same thing
and go right over up towards the brow so
that everything is
uber smooth then I'm going to be going
in with makeup geek faux fur which I die
for that name is it not perfect it's too
good to be true I'm going to grab a much
more small tapered brush this is an m4
1-1 by morphe any small taper brush will
do and I'm going to take that color and
this time I'm making a little bit more
precise keeping it right in my crease as
you can see I'm not blending it up like
I did with the other two shades I'm just
going back and forth and windshield
wiper motions totally avoiding my lid
just staying right there in that crease
area and once we have that down then
I'll kind of press a little bit harder
as you can see me doing to blend out so
that it's not SuperDuper harsh and
that's kind of how we do the cut crease
we soft really really light and we build
a little bit darker I love a darker and
a little bit more precise now I'm going
to change out my brush but I'm going to
stick with the exact same fofor eye
shadow color and this is an m5 zero six
by morphe and it's much more tiny much
more precise and it's going to allow me
to get right in there and really create
that line that I want but if we start
off with this and didn't initially lay
down all those other layers then it
wouldn't be as blended as I want it to
be and I definitely want this to be a
very blended cut crease I don't it to be
super harsh today so I'm going to make
sure that I put that in the entire
crease area and then blend it out just
like you saw me do with all the other
shades now I'm going to pick up some Mac
chroma line in the shade pure white and
I'm going to put this all over my lid
and just begin to carve out this entire
eye look I am using a flat synthetic
brush this is the Mac 242 it is my
favorite Oliver Lib brush I use it every
single day and I'm going to just begin
to carve that entire lid out so that is
very clean I want this to be very harsh
I don't want the upper lid to be harsh
but I do want the cut crease to be harsh
so that's why I am using this cream to
really cut it out and define it that way
it really has that Cruella vibe I'm
going to set the entire lid area with a
white eyeshadow and this is Mac crystal
avalanche it's got a little pinch of a
shimmer in it but honestly like any
white eye shadow matte shimmer it would
totally do and work for this look
perfectly so I'm going to go ahead and
go over that entire area and make sure
that it's all set that way there's no
creases in any of the chroma line that
we set and it doesn't move a dozen budge
it doesn't ruin the rest of the eye look
now I'm going to pick up a matte black
and this is where you want to be really
really careful and I waited until this
part to do it because I just felt like
it was something that I wanted to do
right before I did my eyeliner and as
you can see I am working so gently with
this precise brush I mean I had just
dipped the very tip in and then I barely
touched my eye and I continuously dip
the brush in and just go back and do the
tiniest little strokes to build it up so
gently and so slowly if you dip your
brush in harsh and you start going in
you'll very very quickly it look like
you got punched so I want it to be so
subtle I don't even want it to really
look like I'm wearing black eyeshadow I
just wanted to give that nice shadow
that nice to like definition to the
crease area so now for eyeliner I am
using a gel liner and I'm going to make
my wing a little bit straighter - what I
mean by that is normally I kind of
elevate it up towards my brow a little
bit more but today I'm going to
straighten it just a pinch that way it
kind of matches the liner that I have in
mind for my lower lash line as well I
didn't want it really intense and harsh
and winged straight up to the heavens
you know for my glitter I'm going to go
in with lit cosmetics Marilyn Monroe
this is my favorite silver glitter of
all time because it's just the most
beautiful glitter and lit cosmetics I
feel like makes one of the best glitters
it stays all day and I do use their
glitter adhesive as well I dipped my
precision brush directly in it and then
into the glare and I'm going to carve
out my crease I'm basically going to go
right over that entire line that we
created in the crease area and then just
keep looking down for about a minute
that way if you look straight up at that
point and you had wet glitter it would
definitely get very messy so just keep
looking down while you're applying this
and then once it dries you are good to
go it won't budge now for lashes I'm
going to go in with these amazing lashes
by violet Voss I don't know the name of
them off the top of my head but oh my
gosh I'm so glad that I had them because
I feel like they just complimented this
look so well they kind of remind me of
house of lashes iconic but even more
Vavoom so now we're going to move on to
the face I'm going to start by priming
with this girl on primer that I've been
using the last couple of weeks and I
really do like it so far
then for foundation I'm going to be
using the hourglass vanish stick
foundation this is my favorite at the
moment it's the only one I've been using
for about the past month I love it I'm
going to be buffing that out with a
synthetic kabuki brush get that mask on
girl then for my under eye I'm going to
just take on about 75 pounds of
concealer this
is the tart shape tape concealer my
favorite concealer at the moment as well
I just love this duo this foundation is
concealer together they're just my match
made in heaven it's been my go-to for
the past month or so so once I have all
the foundation of concealer on I'm going
to set my under eye and my entire face
which is what I'm doing now with the RCM
a no color transfer scent powder with my
damp Beauty sponge then I'm going to
fill in my brows and for today's look
I'm going to fill my brows definitely
much heavier than I normally would when
I'm just doing my makeup for day to day
since this is a costume look and
correlative Allah always has very like
big bold kind of bushy brows they're
always like combed upward it's going to
make those nice and bold and I'm going
to highlight my brow bone of course and
I'm using Mac shroom to highlight my
brow bone today then we are going to go
in with the intimidating part which is
the lower lash line and I was like oh my
god don't mess it up Jacqueline that
Ladd's it up but honestly don't be that
scared because what I'm doing is I'm
starting off with just black shadow I'm
not using gel liner just black shadow
and a definer brush this definer brush
MAC Cosmetics sells it Sigma sells it
and morphe sells that they also the
exact same brush it's just the small
definer and I'm going to start off just
with the black shadow creating that line
on the inner and the outer corner now if
you mess this up and you're like oh my
gosh you can grab your concealer and go
over it Pat it you can set it again with
some translucent powder and you can
erase it it won't be the easiest thing
but you can do it I had to do it you can
do it so once I have laid down like my
initial line that's how I'm going to
grab my gel liner and go over it with an
angled brush and then really like make
it intense and make it what I want it to
because I really want this graphic liner
to pop I want it to be kind of like the
star of the show along with the glitter
cut crease I want it to be intense under
there so that's I'm going to do the
exact same thing on the under eye I
start off on the outer corner kind of
matching the first line to my liner just
making it parallel and then bring that
inner corner in and then if you make any
mistakes
you can see right here me obsessing over
if they're even or not I'm just staring
at myself obsessing like what can I do
to improve so I put a little bit of
concealer on another definer brush and I
cleaned up some areas because I was like
nope this needs to be straighter this
needs to be tighter so there I am in the
inner corner so if you make mistakes you
can totally do this and then just keep
going keep manipulating the eyeliner
keep making it work you'll get there it
might take you a little bit but you can
do it
then I'm going to grab just a very small
precise liner brush and some matte white
eyeshadow and I'm going to put that on
the outer corner and in the inner corner
to really make that graphic liner pop
because I thought it looked cool but I
was like no it needs more need something
to make it way more like poppy way more
modern way more costume makeup so I
added the white eyeshadow to really give
it that intensity and then I have to
just go over all the liner one more time
with black to make sure that now that
white eyeshadow covered up because I
want it to remain the star of the show
now for my cheeks I'm going to contour
using the new Becca perfecting powder I
believe it's called and this is in the
shade tan oh my god you guys this powder
is beautiful they came out with a bunch
of different shades and it's so creamy
and so buttery
like when I swatch it I was like oh my
lord
yes so I've been using this recently to
bronze and different shades to contour
so I'm going to carve that out because
you know Cruella I mean I don't
personally know her but I feel like if I
didn't know her she would be contoured
she'll be contoured to the god so that's
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna contour my
face nice and sharp for her and I'm
gonna use some Anastacio brow gel and
comb my brows basically straight up to
keep them nice and bushy in full because
she has very bushy full eyebrows the
entire movie so that's what I'm going to
do then for my lower lashline I'm gonna
put on some mascara but I'm not going to
put on too much because I don't want my
lashes to like really stick out because
then I look a guide doll eyes and it'll
kind of feet the purpose of the Cruella
look I'm gonna grab this big old book of
blushes from Tarte and use one of those
like rosy Mavi blushes and just pack
that all over my cheek area literally
all over as you can see kind of blending
in my contour everywhere I don't it to
be too perfect or too precise because
that's not very Cruella de Vil and I'm
going to take the Kat Von D shade and
light palette I'm going to set that
under-eye area just to make it kind of
pop a little bit more to make it very
highlighted that way it's very like wah
in your face
you like my words that I'm using wah you
get it you know what I mean
then for my lips I'm going to go in with
a Nastasia liquid lip and the shade
American doll this is just a true red I
didn't want to do an orange e red or a
terracotta red or like a pinky red I
want it to be a true red and that's what
American doll is it is like true true
Reds so I did this liquid lip and then I
went over everything with OCC stalker
this is a lip tar and it's really nice
because it's not too
ah see but it's not Matt and she always
has glassy or ellipse and then I thought
this look is complete I'm done
look at me go look at me my bad self and
I was like wait a second I messed up so
once I was full-on Cruella I highlighted
let's get real and now this look is
complete honey so thank you so much for
watching I hope you enjoy I love you
guys and I'll see you later
happy Halloween
ready seven oh my god you look insane do
