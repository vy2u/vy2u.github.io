going to be doing a makeup tutorial on
this smokey ish cat eye liner I have no
idea what the heck I'm following this
video but this look is super easy to
achieve it's very feminine it's very
useful I absolutely love this look I
wore it multiple times when I was out in
LA and I had so many requests to do a
makeup tutorial on this look while I was
on snapchat and even when I was in
public I couldn't believe how many
people were complimenting my eye makeup
cuz I'm like what it's so easy I feel
like when I wear like the most bang and
smokey eye no one says anything and like
it took me 45 minutes to get my liner
even and no one says anything and then
when I do a look like this it's so easy
to achieve that's when everybody stops
me and is like I love your makeup oh my
gosh who did your makeup and I'm like
this isn't fair but I get it because
everyone loves like a nice easy fresh
daytime look so this is very useful very
easy to achieve very feminine
I hope did you guys enjoy this video and
let's get started haha what would that
I'm done I'm done you ever have one of
those days or one of those weeks if you
know what I mean or your brain just will
not turn on and cooperate yeah I'm
having one of those days today I thought
I would just give you a warning and a
heads up so first thing I'm going to do
is prime my eyes and the way I
personally prime my eyes is I use my
concealer which is the Urban Decay
weightless Naked concealer and then I
just blend it out with either my finger
my brush or a Beauty Blender and then
once I have that a really thin layer I
want to make sure it's not too thick a
thin layer of that I will just set it
with some translucent powder i use the
RCM a or you can use like a banana
powder anything that's light and neutral
and you want to set with powder because
then your eyeshadows will go on so
seamlessly and be so easy to blend so
the first shot I'm gonna pick up is
makeup geek tiki hut yeah I love this
color so much and it's so funny because
when make it peak was posting their new
shades I had so many people tagging me
like Jaclyn this color is for you and I
just I love that you guys know that I'm
obsessed with like these baby puke
colors so much so I'm using a sigma e40
and as you can see I'm just putting it
in the outer corner of my crease and
only on the lower lid then I'm gonna
pick up a Nastasia burnt orange and even
though it's called burnt orange it
really isn't a orange just so you guys
know it really looks exactly how it
looks on camera it's a really beautiful
neutral and with the same brush I'm
gonna kind of lightly blend that up
towards the brow I'm kind of sweeping it
all over the lid but I want the lid to
be really neutral and light as you can
see so I'm going to pick up any black
shadow it doesn't matter I am using the
Kat Von D shade + light eye palette just
because that's what I have but any black
shadow will do and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to pick up an itty-bitty
little brush and this is the m55 9 by
morphe honestly an angled brush would
work even better but this is just what I
had sitting there so I use this and I'm
just going to create a liner only on the
outer half of my eye and then I'm going
to take any makeup remover this is the
Sephora waterproof eye makeup remover
because it's one of my favorites I put a
few drips of it in the cap I take an
angled brush this is an anastacio brow
brush technically I get that wet with
the remover and then I just go right
along and create a nice cut cat eye it's
a great trick if you're sloppy with your
eyeliner and you get it all over the
place I'm telling you this trick with
the brush will help you clean up any
mistakes and make your wing sharp enough
to cut everybody that comes into contact
with you because that's just gold let's
get real I'm just going to continue to
blend that liner out and make it a smoky
as you desire I didn't want it to be
crazy smoky I wanted to keep the kind of
daytime appropriate so I kind of smoked
it out rubbed all over the place and
then went back and blackened it up a
little bit so we're gonna do the exact
same step on this eye as well start on
the lashes and go up towards the tail of
the brow it works every time just corner
the lashes and aim towards the tail of
your brow up towards your temple area
make a straight line and then just go
over it running back and forth to make
it nice and blended because we don't
want this line to be harsh this time
around I'm going to grab my pencil brush
and just blend blend blend all over the
place as you can see I'm being sloppy
because mama don't give up if you know
what I mean I'm going to blacken it up a
little bit more and then I will make
sure that it's nice and sharp with the
makeup remover if you don't want it to
be really sharp then don't use the
makeup remover trick but I'm telling you
this makeup remover comp trick comes in
handy when it comes to those wings I
can't do a wing without using this trick
I learned it by a pro artist when I was
working at Mac several years ago and I
had
used it ever since anytime my wing liner
is giving me a hard time I just grab
that makeup remover and that brush and
I'm telling you it comes out perfect
every time so now I'm going to coat my
lashes with mascara and today it's
really important to give them a really
nice coat and make them look as
beautiful as possible because we're not
just going to put on regular lashes
we're only going to pop on half lashes
so I am using the l'oreal voluminous
carbon black mascara it is one of my
favorites and then i'm going to be using
kim lashes by flutter as you can see
they are half they're tapered they're
thinner in the middle they get thicker
and more flared out on the end and i'm
going to pop these right on and as you
see it's really going to compliment that
half liner and it's going to give us a
very intense almond eye effect which i
think is so beautiful whenever i wear
look like this john says that my eyes
look like i'm a tiger and i'm like
that's kind of weird to hear but he's
like it's your tiger eyes that i love so
much and i think it's because the fact
that i have that half wing and the half
lash is kind of flipping upward and it
really makes the eyes look kind of
cat-like and almond shaped which i just
absolutely love so making sure that
those lashes are nice and tight on the
lash line and as you can see the inner
corner of the eye is still totally blank
which is going to help just to open them
up and keep them really wide and bright
and just very cat-like so I'm going to
prime my skin using the Becca luminous
primer and then I'm going to go in with
the Josie Maran vibrancy liquid
foundation oh my gosh this foundation is
everything and I mean everything I was
having a good skin day this day I just I
just got to say it because my skin has
been really giving me some trouble and
I've been really focusing hard on my
skin I've been using that Clarisonic
mama has been on her skin care game my
skin is finally starting to clear up so
thank you thank you Lord for Clarisonic
and good skin care thank you Jesus so
I'm going to blend out the Josie Maran
foundation with the morphe found a
foundation brush excuse me I'm getting
ahead of myself this is the morphe m43 9
one of my favorite foundation brushes of
all time
I am so enough of this foundation you
guys it is so beautiful I'm sure I'll
talk more about it in my next favourites
video actually I know for sure I will
because it is one of my absolute
favorites right now it's just so dewy in
luminous and hydrating but it's not
settling in any of my little like smile
lines and any of my little creases that
I have I love it I just think it makes
my skin look so hydrated and healthy so
many of my friends have been loving it
recently it's just a beautiful
foundation so you know the drill after
foundation I'm going to go ahead and do
some concealer I'm not going to do a lot
today though this might come as a
surprise but I'm literally is going to
do one stripe because I want to keep
this very light and fresh and daytime
appropriate I'm going to be honest
recently I've been using a little less
face makeup because I'm just feeling
like I'm actually starting to notice a
little bit of Aging in my skin which
makes me really sad I don't want to
admit it but it happens and I'm turning
26 I didn't think I was going to see
aging until later in life but it is
happening and I want to use a little bit
less product than normal because I don't
want to make my skin look worse I'm
going to set it with the RCM a no color
transfer scent powder on the exact same
brush this brush by the way is an e 8 by
morphe it's what I use for priming my
eyes a my under eye concealer today I
did not use the Beauty Blender just
because I have been liking this brush a
lot for concealer recently especially
when I'm using a small amount I really
like this brush to blend everything out
with and now I'm going to fill in my
brows I actually shaved off the corner
of my brow I don't really want to talk
about it but this is why you don't try
to shave your face after you've had two
glasses of wine okay ladies and
gentlemen okay okay we'll just move on
from that story right now thank you very
much lately I have only been filling in
the tail of my brow well now I have to
because I shaved it off but I've been
filling in only the tail and then
blending it forward to make it a little
bit more feminine on my face and not as
harsh just a little bit more of a
natural brow I'm gonna highlight my brow
bone just a pinch and then I'm going to
also dab Mac nylon you already know the
drill Mac nylon is life on the inner
corner of my eye this is going to help
just to brighten and widen them even
more if you have far set eyes you might
want to stay away from highlighting the
inner corner of your eyes for this look
in particular then taking a little bit
of black shadow only on the very outer
edge of the lower lash line I'm gonna
just blend that out just to again give
us that really pretty doe-eyed wide eyed
angled eyed how many more um
Tiger eyed effect there we go I'm going
to give my lower lashes a coat of
mascara this is the Kevin a quad mascara
I have been loving my mom is the one
that got me onto this and I will link it
down below because I know last time a
lot of people were say that they
couldn't find it so I will link it for
you I'm just going to touch up my lashes
and go over them with a little bit of
black just so they look as natural as
possible because I never want to see the
lash band when you look down it kind of
gives away all your dirty secrets even
though people know they're fake come on
we got to make em look as real as
possible then I'm going to bronze my
skin I'm going to be using a Mac give me
Sun bronzer and this gigantic Tom for
bronzer brush and today I'm not going to
be contouring or sculpting at all I'm
literally going to bronze so as you see
I'm going to start on the outer half of
the face on the cheekbone I'm going to
be blending backward I'm going to be in
circular motions down by my chin down on
my lower jaw all around my forehead I'm
just gonna make sure I avoid the center
of my face I never ever ever bronze the
center of my face otherwise I can look
very muddy very quickly I can look dirty
like I've been playing out in the
sandbox it's not a good look but like
this it kind of looks more like you've
been baking in like the desert uh yes I
love it just give me a nice bronze
golden face that's all I ask for in life
so I'm going to make sure I pack on that
ron's er and then I'm going to grab a
little bit of my Mac Pro emphasize on a
fluffy brush I'm gonna put a little bit
of it in the center of my forehead this
is just a highlighting powder that is
not shimmery it's more of a satin so
it's not gonna be frosty but it's just
gonna bring some light to the face
because I kind of felt like some of that
bronzer got thrown into the center of my
face and I wanted to clean up just the
pinch and now I'm going to be going in
with a highlight but I'm not going to
talk about just quite yet you can follow
me on snapchat if you want because I
will be talking about it much more very
soon I'm going to highlight my cheeks
using the morphe m500 brush I have been
loving this brush recently for highlight
just cuz it's so different and big and
fat and I think it puts the highlight
everywhere thank you Jesus and then I'm
going to do my blush and I am using
Becca wild honey and oldie but a goodie
you know how I feel about wild honey and
I am using the morphe e for blush brush
I think this is my number one blush
brush of all time I've used it for
probably a year now and I'm still not
sick of it I just love it so much it is
like the perfect perfect brush for blush
now for my lips I'm just gonna do a
gloss and this is NARS sassy girlz one
of my favorite glosses it's so pretty I
love the consistency it's a beautiful
formula it's my everyday go-to gloss
along with a few others but it's one of
them now last Benally
I need to just set my brows because my
brows will take flight if I do not lock
and load those bitches with some
superglue aka and Nastasia clear brow
gel is the most amazing brow gel in the
world and then once we have done that
I'm just going to spray a little bit of
fix+
all over my face just a quick little
shower not a long one just just a quick
one and we will be glowing and good to
go looking fresh for days so I hope you
enjoy this tutorial I love you I'll see
you soon bye guys the look when I was in
it because I feel like when I am animal
the hell I'm doing right now I am done
it did I stopped in a British accent
today even though it's so old that I'm
probably going to offend many many
people watching this
oh hey hey maybe man I'm in a bit of a
separate today's makeup tutorial

crazy any together like right now I need
to go mini shower because it's not man
