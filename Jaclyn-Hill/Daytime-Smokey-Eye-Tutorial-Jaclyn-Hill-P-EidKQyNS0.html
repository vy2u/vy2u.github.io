a makeup tutorial for you this is the
look that I was wearing in my most
recent video my March favorites I got so
many comments and questions and requests
from you guys to show you exactly how I
did that makeup look and do a tutorial
for you so I figured why not I told a
bunch of you that it's you know my basic
Browns that I use all the time but you
guys really insisted on seeing this so
it's a really great way to do an
afternoon smokey eye where you're not
using tons of black and making it too
dark it's very very pretty and it's
gonna look good on all different eye
colors so it's really easy and a
technique that I use of transitioning
the shades from dark to light I think
this is something that everybody should
utilize when they're doing makeup all
the time so I really hope you enjoy this
video and I will see you soon bye
hello everybody okay so I basically woke
up feeling very sick today so I need to
cover up the bags and the redness around
my eyes which is why I'm using Mac's Pro
Longwear concealer this is a great
eyeshadow primer because it doesn't
crease has a technology in it not to
settle the fine lines and wrinkles plus
it goes in and it covers up the color on
your lids so you have a nice fresh base
to start with so after that I'm gonna
grab Mac's soft brown you can use soft
brown texture saddle Samoas silk bamboo
any of those mid-tone Browns that you
prefer you know I love my warm Browns
and I am taking this is the Sigma brush
on the e-40 I believe we'll see how I do
with these numbers I just want to say
it's the Mac 224 because it's basically
the same thing but it's the Sigma e-40
and I'm going to take this color and I'm
going to buff it all in that crease I'm
starting in the outer corner to get the
most density of the color out there but
then I'm going to smooth it all the way
around I'm going to bring it in like a
rainbow motion inset in our socket and I
want this to really really be buffed out
because this is going to be the base of
everything there's not going to be a lot
of attention on this but it's very
important so blend blend blend then I'm
going to take Max saddle I know that
I've used these shades a lot before but
you know these are just great basic
shades to have and if you already own
these or you know if you've bought
products based off my recommendations
which I know a lot of you have I just
you know want to give you another way
that you can be using all of these
colors because you really can use them
in so many ways Browns are not just
brown eye they they are my favorite
colors to work but they go so far okay
I'm using the Sigma e25 just like the
Mac 217 and I'm just buffing his color
in my crease I'm you want to do this
right below the soft Brown so the soft
Brown is above it and then this color is
below it same motion though just right
below it then I'm going to take Mac Pro
ground Brown this is a pro shade so
you're not going to be able to get it at
a normal counter or free-standing store
you're going to have to either order
online or get at a Mac Pro store and I'm
taking the Mac 252 which is just a
bigger version of the small 242 that I'm
always talking about
and I'm just going to buff this color on
all over the bottom part of my lid if
you can see I'm not really bringing us
tons into that inner corner and I'm not
going to take it all the way up to the
crease I want to keep this as low and
buffed out as possible and then I'm
going to go back with that saddle you
can pick up more saddle on your brush if
you want or you can just use whatever is
left over the point of this motion is
just to blend all this together so you
don't have any harsh lines in here
because the point of this is to have a
really nice gradient from the dark brown
to the light brown so you just want to
make sure that everything is blended
together and there's no harsh lines
because that's not going to be cute on
anybody so you can see how quickly I
work and I just throw it all around my
eye because you really can't mess this
up
and then I'm going to take the 242 which
is the brush that I'm always talking
about how much I love and I'm just going
to continue to pack that on even more
just to get a little bit more density on
the lower part of my lid since I blended
it all out so after we blended and we
made it all beautiful and seamless I'm
just going to go pack a little bit more
of this color just so that that Brown
stands out a little bit for some reason
on camera this brown is looking shimmery
but I assure you that it's not it also
looked kind of shimmery in person but
it's not shimmery I don't know why the
light is picking up on it like that
anyways I'm using Maybelline's gel
eyeliner Maybelline eye studio gel
eyeliner and black is black and I
believe this is the Sedona lace brush
that I'm using right here um my favorite
eyeliner brush ever is the Sigma one the
Sedona lace one is really good too
obviously I'm using it I so I like it um
but yeah I like these brushes they're
very dense they're very easy to work
with and I'm making just a little point
on my eyeliner and extending it a tad
bit past my eye shadow and then I'm
taking a matte black eye shadow this is
carbon by Mac on a 212 brush and I am
just buffing this out because I don't
want this eyeliner to be too precise on
the lid I want it to be buffed out on
the lid but then I want the wing to stay
nice and sharp
just to give more of that gradient so
it's black eyeliner and I want to kind
of smoke it out up into a dark brown to
a medium brown to a light brown just to
really really Center in and give the eye
color a lot of attention then I'm going
to use velour lashes
today I know you guys were asking so
many questions about them I'm gonna
apply mascara first I don't harm the
lashes at all and then I'm just going to
take them and set them on the top lid
these are such amazing lashes and they
are so easy to work with it's insane I
can't stop the name of these are strike
a pose a lot of you were asking and
strike a pose is the same ones I was
using in my last video you can just see
how beautiful and fluffy they are
they're so gorgeous and then I'm going
to take room by Mac you could also use
dazzle light or mylar whatever you
prefer
I'm going to take shroom I'm gonna put
it on the high point of that brow bone
and then after I do that oh my gosh I
have so much I've so much concealer my
eyebrows they look so light and then I'm
gonna take blank type and this is a
matte shade on that same brush and I'm
gonna go over it just to buff it out a
little bit so that it's not super super
shimmery and then some I'll just take my
finger sometimes and just usually like
run over that just to make sure that
there's no harsh line with the highlight
and then the brown and then I'm going to
use L'Oreal True Match Lumi I am in
shade w5 yes I went out and bought more
in my recent video I told you guys that
I was completely out well that only
lasted about four days and I was like I
need you back I'm using the Sigma f80
brush to just buff this all over the
face and then I'm using the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and nw20 under the
eyes and then I'm going to use Mac Pro
powder and accentuate to highlight that
under-eye area
the clip of me putting on my um
concealer was accidentally deleted but
still you guys know how to do it and I'm
sure I'll be making a video on
foundation and concealer very soon
anyways and I'm just going to highlight
that area and move on as always I am
using Mac's quark eyeshadow on the brows
and a two-on-two brush it's weird cuz
whenever I film a video this is always
how I fill my brows but I actually like
to use brow pencils a lot too but for
some reason whenever I'm filming a video
I always use eye shadow it's really
really weird it's just a little
something that I've noticed I need to
show you guys how I do it with my liner
my pencil sometime okay and then I'm
going to use Mac's mineralize skinfinish
in shade medium
I'm gonna take a big fluffy brush and
powder my face which is something you
rarely see me do because I'm so dry but
I am doing this just because recently
I've noticed that my foundation is
tending to break up a little bit as the
humidity is coming back here and then
I'm going to use mac's mineralize
skinfinish again in medium deep with a
big fluffy brush and just pack this all
over the face I'm not sure if this
brushes Mac or Sigma it looks like it
might be Mac it doesn't matter tomato
tomahto so anyways I'm just using this
just to stay right on the high points of
that cheekbone of mine and then right at
the hairline on the forehead just to
give that color that density on the
outer portion of my face to give more
attention to the inner part of my face
which is my eyes and then I'm going to
take Mac Pro blush and cantaloupe
absolutely beautiful it is it's got such
a gorgeous Sheen it looks matte but it
goes on with a little bit of Sheen to it
love this color it's like a it's like a
coral pink oh it's beautiful so I'm
taking a 1:29 short needle brush to
apply that and then I run back with my
kabuki brush with nothing no additional
product just to kind of sculpt out the
bottom of that face so that no bronzer
contour has fallen down there I'm using
Mac's mineralize skinfinish and soft and
gentle to highlight I'm gonna be honest
I'm kind of bored with my highlighting
products recently I feel like it's this
or the mary-lou manizer by the balm or
NARS albatross and I'm really in the
market for new great cheek highlighters
so if you guys have any that you can't
live without please let me know because
I'm very interested I'm using Urban
Decay perversion eyeliner this is the
jet-black this is the 24/7 eye liner and
I'm lining my inner room and then I'm
going to grab saddle again
normally I don't lie my inner rim but I
have been trying to embrace it recently
because I think it really gives this
beautiful dimension to the eyes and it
really irritates my eyes but this eye
liner doesn't compared to other coals
out there and I'm just buffing
everything out with a pencil brush just
to make it seamless once again so we
don't have any harsh lines the trick
down here you guys is to really blend
it's going to feel like it's taking an
hour but sometimes you guys stay down
here for a good minute or
and just blend blend blend to get that
really beautiful buffed out look and I'm
going to take a little bit more of
ground Brown Pat it in there and then
blend that out again and I know it's a
lot of women are always telling me
whenever I do their makeup that they
have an issue with the under eye area
and it's because everyone is so eager to
just run a brush across it and move on
but really you have to stay down there
and really work to blend that area out
and I promise it'll be seamless
beautiful just like you see in all the
magazines so there we have the eyes done
other than just a little bit of mascara
I am using the Maybelline something
extensions OH I don't know but it's a
great mascara and I really really like
it especially for the bottom lashes
because I really like to separate the
bottom lashes otherwise they're just a
hot mess and then if you mess up and get
a little mascara wait till it dries run
a q-tip over it and poof it's gone
like it never even happened great trick
and then I'm going to take the NYX
butter gloss that I talked about my
March favorites this is in creme brulee
I'm just going to give a light wash of
that on the lips so that nothing is too
dramatic on there since we're
concentrating on the eyes and after that
your look is complete I hope you guys
enjoy and I will see you my next video
mmm hugs and kisses bye you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
