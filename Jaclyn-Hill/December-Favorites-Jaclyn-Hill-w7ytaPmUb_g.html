is going to be my December favorites
crazy that this is the last favorites of
2015 we're gonna move past that because
that would freak me out but this is
actually my second time trying to film
this video today I found this video this
afternoon and then I walked away from it
I started doing stuff around my house I
start picking up all that jazz course I
immediately D robed and put my hair up
in a bun and changed my outfit to a
sweater which is what I'm comfortable in
and then I imported the footage on my
computer and I was like I hate this I
hate this so much I hated the video that
I filmed today I didn't like the way my
hair looks I didn't like the way I
looked I have like the worst foggy brain
today I'm stuttering over all my words
I'm just such a mess so bear with me I'm
hoping that by being like in my natural
habitat meaning my yoga pants and my
sweatshirt and my messy bun maybe I will
be a little bit more in the flow of
things because it's just that day is
that day you ladies know what day I'm
talking about I have a little friend
right here my brain is so foggy I'm
crampy I'm crabby and I'm just like so
watch out and add a couple screws loose
in my head today okay so this should be
a fun video to it
this isn't even a favorite boo this is
just sitting here and I'm super excited
try this this is that Nivea men
aftershave balm and I got the sensitive
one because so many people on YouTube
were talking about this I feel like
nikkietutorials was the first one to
mention this and now tons of people are
using it and I'm like so excited to try
this as a primer um I actually am
nervous though because when I was
younger
Nivea body lotion used to give me a rash
so I'm hoping that did not happen on my
face but we shall see I know that's
random but I just got in the mail
sitting here and I'm like I can't really
try you the first thing I want to talk
about is a foundation I've been using
for a really long time but I don't know
if I've actually talked about it in a
favorites video knowing me I'm sure I
have I'm just like but anyways this is
the ex1 and visit wear liquid foundation
this foundation is effing bomb that's
what it is it's incredible so it claims
to be invisible where I'm never going to
say that the foundation is actually
invisible because if you're putting
something on your face it's just you're
going to be able to see it in some sense
what I'm saying but I will say that this
is
one of the most invisible foundations I
have ever used in the sense that it
looks like skin it looks like healthy
skin it looks luminous and it looks
fresh and it looks natural yeah it is
extremely high coverage which I love so
it definitely goes on a medium to a full
coverage depending what you used to
apply it what technique you're using
it's just so beautiful it's thick and
it's creamy and it just looks so natural
while evening everything out and making
your skin one tone this is what I'm
wearing today I've been using it for
months I actually purchased this based
on other youtubers recommendations I
can't there's a fuzzy I can't think of
the youtubers right now of course I can
I'm literally my brain is not on today I
think Amanda Edison was one of them
though I might be completely wrong
Amanda I think could be watching us
thinking like what the hell I'm talking
about but I'm pretty sure that I'm
enough oh I'm pretty sure that Amanda
ancing was one of them to talk about
this foundation it's bomb thanks girl
love you okay so next foundation oh my
god you guys I love this so much this is
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
foundation I've used this now six times
and I am in love with that this is
hands-down my favorite drugstore
foundation now if you guys are one of my
OC subscribers then you would remember
back in the day I was obsessed with the
original L'Oreal True Match Lumi the
L'Oreal True Match just the basic one I
was never really a fan I thought it was
a little bit too dry for me but when the
lumi one came out I was obsessed in the
glass bottle and like the pump I went to
probably like five or six bottles of
that in like a year and a half period I
was so in love my skin actually
developed a sensitivity to it though and
if I wear it two days in a row I will
get little bumps all over my cheeks not
cute so this one I don't have no
sensitivity to whatsoever it's not
you're taking my skin which I'm so
thankful for because I absolutely love
this formula it is so hydrating so ultra
moisturizing it's just creamy its
luminous that there's no glitter there's
no shimmer a tiny bit goes a long way
I love the application of this cushion
it's super high pigmented a tiny bit
will cover your entire cheek so like if
you're going to take a Beauty Blender or
a brush you literally just Boop right in
there and go directly on the face it's
just so beautiful so if you are drive to
skin and you are looking for a really
beautiful luminous dewy foundation from
the drugstore look no further so good so
sticking with the skin oh oh this
concealer is so bomb and you know like
if you know me at all it is so difficult
for me to be impressed by a concealer I
am so picky when it comes to concealers
I have been doing YouTube on and off for
four years I say on and off because when
I first started YouTube I only uploaded
like a couple videos and then I stopped
for like five or six months because I
was like this is not going to work what
am i doing stupid idea Jacqueline and
then I decided months later to come back
very happy about the decision very glad
I came back but uh anyways in that four
year time period co-star on YouTube I've
only loved two concealers which is the
Mac Pro Longwear and the Urban Decay
Naked skin I believe those are the only
two that I've actually the only two that
I've been like ride-or-die for so the
fact that I have another one that I am
in love with is just crazy because I'm
so picky about concealer and this is
balm so this is a Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD I don't know if it's available on the
market yet because they sent all of the
colors to everyone on their PR list but
it didn't come with a note so I don't
know when they release if they did
release I don't know anything about it
but it did have a pretty wide range of
shades and it's super duper creamy and
the thing I love about this is you
really get your money's worth because
the tiniest bit goes such a long way
like a little tiny drop covers so much
area it's so creamy it's so moisturizing
which is amazing for that under-eye area
because if you have a concealer that
dries to dry it can make that under eye
area look really crepey and actually
kind of age you which is the only
complaint that I would ever have about
the Mac Pro Longwear this one is so
moisturizing and so creamy I do set it
with a powder though because I set
everything with a powder and that
technique I have not had any issues so
another base product that I have which
is an oldie but a goodie I have this
powder in every shade because I've use
it for everything at one point bronzing
contouring highlighting
face powder eyeshadow and just it's such
a good powder so this is the mac
mineralize skinfinish natural it looks
like this natural just means that it's
just a regular face powder because the
mac mineralize skinfinish is also come
in highlights but this is just the
regular natural face powder I'm
currently using the shade medium and I
am using this to set my foundation on a
day to day basis oh my gosh I love it so
much so back in the day all my whole
life up until recently I've never set my
entire face with powder I'll do
Foundation and then I'll under eyes I'll
set that with powder and maybe my chin
to my forehead but that's it always like
the cheeks blamed in the nose link well
recently I have changed that method
because my foundation has been wearing
off throughout the day and I just don't
like how it looks sometimes it can
separate a little bit and just look a
little blotchy but recently I've been
setting it with powder and I just love
the outcome so much more so still
flawless which is weird because I've
always my entire like time that I've
done makeup on clients I set every
client with powder be it myself
I don't that's weird right I've been
using the Laura Mercier translucent
powder the past couple of months and I'm
so done with this I'm done like it just
makes me to dry I love the way it looks
but it's too dry on my already dry skin
and throughout the day I can feel the
dryness and it's just like like it just
doesn't feel good if you are oily this
will be your best friend for setting
your face but for me I need something
with luminosity and hydration and that
is this powder this powder has such a
sheer light coverage to it like even if
I dig in so hard and like just swatch
swatch swatch you'll see like how sheer
that coverage is and when it blends out
it like completely disappears this is a
found date Saigon foundation this is the
power that I used to recommend to
clients there were like 15 years old
when they would come into the MAC store
and ask for like a first foundation this
is what I would recommend to young girls
because it's just such light coverage
and it's so lightweight and it looks so
natural it's a beautiful luminous very
natural-looking powder without shimmer
without glitter it's just gorgeous so
I've been using this with a powder brush
this powder brush right here to set my
entire face after I applied my
foundation and I just love it I love it
I have not been
happy with my foundation in a long time
I just think it looks so flawless so
math neural eye skin finish what are we
talking about that bro
so Anastasio Beverly Hills came out with
new shadows this month and I have three
of them that I am absolutely in love
with and the first one I use in my last
tutorial which is the shade fudge oh my
god I did this Brown is such perfection
it's just perfection you can use on the
outer corner of your eye you can use it
under your eyes this is what I have
under my lash line right now it's just
such a beautiful pigmented dark brown
and it's the perfect amount of warmth
it's not so warm that it's red or orange
but it's not cool either it's just that
perfect dark fudgy matte Brown so good
that's such a staple the second one is
aubergine which is a beautiful purple
shape so what I love about this is that
it's not a true frost but it's not a
true matte it took a really perfect
luster right in between the two formulas
and for some reason when I swatch on my
hand I don't like it as much as when I
swatch it on my actual eye but it looks
like this so you can see it's not like
purple purple on in your face what I've
actually been doing is putting fudge on
my lower lash line and then taking a
pencil brush with abridging and blending
out fudge with this and these two colors
mixed together are just such a beautiful
like her Polly Brown it's just so
gorgeous last but not least this color
should just be named Jacqueline let's
get real do I even need to say anything
else this color is perfection like when
I got this in the mail I was like are
you kidding this is incredible it's
pretty much map coppering on steroids
look at that color oh this color is that
rude mmm good job Claudia the job
Anastasia this is gorgeous and I
honestly feel like their eyeshadow
quality has gone up since they first
launched like I definitely see a
difference which is very common because
when you first launch a product like it
takes a minute to really like see what
the consumer is loving and see like
things you want to fix and I
think that their shadows are definitely
higher quality than they were when they
initially launched and I love them okay
so now I have a few lip products I want
to talk about and the first one are
these new NYX liquid suede cream
lipsticks I'm sorry I'm showing the two
backwards I purchased these on Ulta calm
at the same time I purchased the L'Oreal
True Match cushion foundation I only got
two shades but I'm going to get more
because I love these now I have more
both the pink one I am wearing right now
but I mix it with something that I'm
working on and I'm talking about um okay
this these these formulas are just so
fun and different and innovative and I
love them so basically when I got them
I'm like okay NYX liquid suede cream
lipsticks like what are these gonna be
like so basically what it is is it's
like a crossbreed between a lipstick and
a liquid lipstick so it's not so mad and
so dry that you get butthole lips and
you know what butthole lips are like
when you go this and you got like that
big ring because the liquid lipsticks
are so dry and it's just inevitable
these aren't going to give you that but
yeah they're not creamy to the point
they're going to give you shine so they
are matte but they feel like suede on
your lips they're really cool and I have
a feeling that a lot of cosmetic brands
are going to be coming out with this
formula in 2016 for those of you who
cannot get on board with the liquid
lipstick trend because I was very late
to get on board cuz I'm just a glossy
girl I love glossy lips I think they're
so feminine I think they're so pretty I
do love the matte lips and I'm very very
picky about what liquid lip formula I
wear because some of them are so dang
dry that your lips like crack throughout
the day and it's just not a good look
so this is the other color I was wearing
this earlier today right here beautiful
so the dark one is 0-3 and the baby pink
one that I'm wearing is 0-9 this next
product is honestly so good it's like
one of those products it's so good that
I don't really know how to talk about it
because like it doesn't even need like
an explanation it's just that good and
this is a Geoffrey Star velour liquid
lipstick I am so happy for Jeffrey's our
I just think he is so cool I think that
his packaging is amazing it because
product is amazing I just he's such an
inspiration
he's someone who just puts out quality
products and he's just so badass I
really look up to him I think it's
amazing what he is doing so this is one
of his velour liquid lipsticks in the
shade and drogyny this shade sells
itself it doesn't even need an
introduction it's so beautiful it truly
is the perfect Mavi purplish brown shade
and it's still wearable it's not too
dark that it looks like poopoo it's not
too purple it's just gorgeous every time
I wear this strangers are asking me what
I'm wearing all of my friends have
purchased this shade because it's just
so beautiful everyone in my life pretty
much owns this shade and they're all
different skin colors and it just looks
good on everyone he did such a bomb job
with the formula and this color it's
just absolutely beautiful it's such a
good formula it's not too thick it's not
too moosie because sometimes liquid lips
are too moosie and they're hard to apply
and then they get so chunky they like
flake off you know what I'm talking
about if you wear a liquid lipstick this
one is the perfect formula it's like
nice and watery it's not too thin though
so it's not patchy it's just beautiful
kathleenlights teams up with Oprah
cosmetics again to create Havana nights
and I have worn this other thing I
drogyny in this it's been a tie I have
worn them both equally as much but when
I got Havana nights in the mail
I wore it that day with absolutely no
makeup all around town running errands
cuz I like it's so beautiful I don't
even care I'm just wearing it like it's
such a gorgeous deep kind of blood red I
love it so much congratulations again to
Kathleen that girl is just doing so Bond
right now I'm so happy for her and this
is just so beautiful but the formula
itself is incredible so moisturizing it
takes hours until it starts breaking up
and getting dry because every lips
liquid lipstick is going to get dry you
can't beat that but it takes hours for
this one to start getting dry like it's
just so good so the color is good this
formula is good I love it if you guys
are looking for an amazing matte like
blood deep burgundy get Havana nights
seriously it is absolutely gorgeous to
give a shot at this product because it
is so good and I feel like people don't
talk about it as much
as it should be talked about was it such
a great product and this is the Urban
Decay heavy metal glitter liner I use
these glitter liners all the time
whenever it's a special occasion it's
like a birthday or New Year's Eve or
Christmas or whatever it is a Tuesday
afternoon I am all about these glitter
liners they're my absolute favorite
formula out there I've tried a bunch of
them and some of them are like super
duper chunky some of them to sing my
eyes and they dry out really easy this
one is my personal favorite now of
course do you get this in your eye it's
going to sting but this does not
irritate my eyes whatsoever when it's on
my lids or on my skin this is what I
have on my top lid right now I just
literally took it and just went like
this and just dabbed it right on my
eyeshadow I'm looking around if you're a
beginner it can be very intimidating to
work with loose glitters like this
because they fall down all over your
face you got to use glitter glue it can
be a little messy a little sloppy I get
it and you can literally like great
where do I go from here that's why I
love these so much because you literally
just paint it on it doesn't remove your
eyeshadow like some do it's just
beautiful I want them to come out with
even more colors because they have a
good amount of colors but I want like
six-feet colors like I want them in
every shade I want them in 3d like I'm
obsessed with these so I have a new body
butter that I have been in love with you
know me and my body butters I'm obsessed
with anything moisturizing and this is
so bomb I have to say that my number one
is still blissful body but this comes in
right at number 2 and this is the peeled
soy milk and honey whipped body butter
and it says that it is with shea and
jojoba butter is in it it's good it is
so good and I love the texture
I am very weird about textures when it
comes to textures on my hands when it
comes to textures of food that I eat I
definitely have like sensory issues when
it comes to certain textures and this
one is like heaven every time I put my
hands into this tub I'm like oh I love
the way it feels because it's whipped so
it's very different than a typical body
butter and I love the way it smells to
me it smells like almond butter I know
that it says it has shea and jojoba but
it smells like almond to me it's just so
yummy and it's so ultra moisturizing and
my husband loves it too yes me and John
we are moisturizing people if you come
into this home
and you have dry skin you will be
leaving with moisturized skin that's
what we do around here
we moisturize all right so I have two
things left and the first thing I would
talk about is this perfume by Lanvin I
have no idea how to pronounce it I'm not
even gonna try because I will totally
offend an entire culture by me trying to
pronounce the name of this so I will
just put the name down below in the
description bar and I'll find a link for
so you guys can look at it for yourself
but I actually purchased this perfume
three years ago when I was working at
Mac and I used it like a month or two
and then I just lost it in my collection
and I found it in this room when I was
cleaning out a couple of weeks ago and
now I've been using it all month long
and I am just so I am just so in love
with this perfume it's such a fresh
daytime scent but there's something
different about it it's not like a
typical perfume it's just like sexy and
feminine but just so fresh at the same
time and every single time I spray this
on John always complements me and the
other perfume that John always
compliments is Marc Jacobs Daisy so they
kind of were similar in the sense in the
sense that they both have a very fresh
scent but they're very very different
but he's like obsessed with this every
time I spray it on he's like oh my god
he keeps hugging me because he's like it
just smells so amazing I'm like okay fun
name is Bob no keep going okay so last
thing I want to talk about is something
I would actually like never even talked
about here my channel but because every
single time I am wearing these
sunglasses whether it's on snapchat and
a picture or even when I'm just out
running errands if I'm like at the gas
station people are always asking me
about these glasses so I thought I would
just mention them so everyone knows
these are by the designer Miu and I
purchased mine at Nordstrom I'm sure if
you can find them like wherever designer
sunglasses are sold but honest I they
have this glitter that looks kind of
like broken glass that goes all the way
down and then in the front of kind of a
men's style shade it's kind of similar
to like that up the Wayfarers I think
they're called by Ray Ban I might be
totally wrong but they're kind of
similar and then right here it's an
ombre effect on the lens it's like light
that fades up to super dark black I just
love them these have been like one of
the only pairs of sunglasses I have
over the past couple of months because I
just think they're so cool they're edgy
and they're glam at the same time
they're just so fun so mu mu and I got
mine at Nordstrom I will find them and
I'll put them down below for you guys
somewhere if you're interested you guys
can check them out for yourselves
because I know that I get questions
about them every single time I wear them
