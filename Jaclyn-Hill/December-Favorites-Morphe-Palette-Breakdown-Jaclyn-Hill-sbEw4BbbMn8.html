December favorites for you and I'm so
happy to be seeing down and doing this
because I feel like I've done makeup
tutorials like all month long and I
haven't really gotten a chance to sit
down and talk to you guys which I
totally missed in favorite videos on my
favorite video weight favorites
Beauty fit my favorite okay what
favorites videos are my favorite videos
to film and to watch I just like it
they're a little bit more laid-back and
a little bit more casual and I get to
just kind of talk to you guys and catch
up with you and then you guys get to
tell me what your favorites are for the
month and I just really like them so
let's jump into it because I did miss
the month of November so I have a lot of
products because of the fact that this
is like sixty days worth where I haven't
talked about my favorites so let's get
into it so the first thing I want to
talk about this honestly needs to be
addressed and I'm sure tons of you
already know exactly what about to
mention this is a palette that I teamed
up with morphe brushes and collaborate
with them to create for you guys this is
called the Jaclyn hill favorites palette
let me just say it's so weird referring
to this as the Jacqueline have a birds
since I am Jack on hill feeling I'm
talking in third person so let just move
that back so this is a jab in love
Eric's palette it's totally normal
packaging on the back it just has a
little JH sticker just to signify what
palette it is and then the outer
packaging that it comes in and looks
like this it says Jaclyn hill favorites
you flip it over it's a picture of yours
truly with my little description as to
why I collaborate with morphe decree
this palette for you guys so basically
what this is is my top 28 morphe
eyeshadows put into a palette for a
discounted price
so it looks like this or what's heel
sorry it's very messy because I have
been loving all over this bad boy the
past couple of weeks ever since I got it
in the mail um we have a range of shades
here we have lights to darks we have
light shimmers cool tone shimmers warm
shimmers warm Browns cool Browns pastels
Pink's cranberries left of purples a pop
of green corals and oranges home in this
rusty shadow right here is my favorite
one I can't get enough I absolutely love
it I am wearing this palette on my eyes
today I'm wearing all the warm colors
I'm wearing this is this this end this
did somebody say to me years
lucien was going to be to wear more cool
tones I don't know that either I'm just
kidding but totally serious
so typically their shadows are two
dollars apiece in this palette you're
getting 28 shadows for $28 so this is a
one dollar a piece right here I
absolutely love these shadows this is
now my go-to palette I might be a little
biased but I just I just actually love I
love these I would never put my name on
something that I don't love I love these
I believe in these shadows especially
for two bucks like well now one dollar
piece like you can't go wrong they're
just they're the greatest shadows you
will ever try at such a low cheap and
expensive price I can't promise you that
there is no better shadow that you're
going to find for one or two dollars a
piece and the fur so if you are a girl
on a budget or even if you're not a girl
on a budget and you're just like I am
you like it in some shadows for a dollar
a piece this is where that this palette
went on presale New Year's Eve midnight
Pacific Standard Time and I let everyone
know on social media more Figur cider
100 on social media we are so excited
anticipating the arrival this palette
for to finally go on presale because we
have been working on it for so long and
morphe had so many comments so many
email so many phone calls from people so
excited for this palette that they made
sure to contact their IT team and let
them know listen there's a lot of people
excited we're expecting a huge amount of
traffic at midnight on New Year's Eve we
need this website to hold its ground we
want it to run smoothly
we don't want issues so on and so forth
so there are web team let them know that
their their website can handle 1.5
million people at a time smoothly
checking out and entering their credit
card information so we are like sweet
golden we're not gonna have any issues
there because we definitely are going to
have 1.5 million people like that's
Gabriel so lo and behold 15 minutes
before the palette even went on presale
the website crashed it was lagging it
was freezing it was a hot mess I of
course could do nothing about it this is
not my website this is not my company so
as a control freak I'm just sitting on
the side like the owner of morphe she
was freaking out her IT team they didn't
know what was going on it was a hot mess
they want to turn these two statements
you guys that you know to stay because
they had no idea what was going on and
they were so frustrated the owner of
morphe was just crying and his head
I mean four days and barely even slept I
have felt so bad for her seriously just
go send more for your love because this
was not their fault
basically they ended up finding out over
24 hours later the issue that their
website was having is that they were
being severely hatched from multiple
places I don't understand how this whole
IT thing works I do make up not numbers
it's not my thing so I'm not going to
try to talk about stuff that I am NOT
educated on but basically all I know is
that they are being hacked from multiple
places and it was just a hot mess
apparently these hackers we're sending
fake huge amounts of traffic to make the
website basically crash and make it near
impossible for you guys to actually
order the pallet so I am so terribly
sorry and frustrating right there with
you that the hackers had to ruin this
experience for you guys it's just a hot
mess but at least they figure out what
it was they are figuring out how to
overcome it and they are completely
redoing everything in the meantime so
that will get improved with that being
said this palette did sell out even with
these hackers bombarding the site you
guys still managed to sell these pallets
in two and a half days I don't know how
I thought that they were gonna last for
at least a month or two with how many
they ordered but they were gone in two
and a half days so because they sold out
so quickly and because it was such a
painful task for those of you who did
purchased it they are going to be
restocking it in the month of February
for you guys so those of you pre-ordered
will be getting your pallets Indiana
January January January and then the
rest of you if you want to go ahead and
purchase it because you didn't get the
chance to maybe we're too frustrated to
fully understand they will be restocking
in February they will also have some of
these pallets at the booth at IMATS and
LA later this month and if you are going
to be there so that is that again I am
so sorry for the frustration but at the
same time let me just say it for those
of you who are so dedicated and
persevere it's out there at your
computer and you got through and you got
that palette goals all online shopping
goals I salute you I will be doing
makeup tutorials with this palette
towards the end of the month once you
guys start receiving them so we can have
some fun and play with it together so
that is that let's move on to the rest
of my favorites so I have to say this is
the most random favorites I've ever
as far as like eggs just all over the
place so I'm just gonna granule it go
through them I'm not going to try to
start with categories or and make that
the first thing is a new lash brand I
just discovered these are incredible
these are lashes by Lena maybe they're
called Lena lashes the style that I am
in love with are the Bianca lashes oh my
god I'm wearing them right now I have
several pairs because I'm not kidding
these are like my favorite lashes ever
I've used them in quite a few tutorials
this month already and I don't want to
over use them since you guys get sick of
them but seriously they're all I want to
put on my eyes they are so dense they're
so full they're so fluffy they're so
thick they just they're gorgeous they
look gorgeous with eyeliner they look
gorgeous without eyeliner I am wearing
them today and I have no eyeliner on my
eyes it's just shadow and I put lashes
on eyes absolutely love them they aren't
too long which is what I love is they're
very thick very full they make a
statement like no other but they're not
so long that it's like ooh too much you
know what I'm saying they're just
absolutely gorgeous
like honestly do you see these they are
just so thick and just oh just luscious
they're just luscious lashes this is a
super simple just basic makeup item but
I just wanted to talk about it because
everyone's always looking for a good
black eyeliner and this I have been
using constantly on my lower lash line
in my waterline and this is by the brand
ardency in I've mentioned the quite a
few times and I get all the artists and
stuff that I buy on Sephora website
they're not in my local Sephora but they
are online I'll link it down below of
course but this is the ardency in it
says monster on it and it's the black
eyeliner this stuff is no joke like I'm
going to swatch it oh do you see how
pigmented and black that is like it is
black as coal and when it goes on your
waterline it's just like you don't sit
there and go over and over and over like
I'm gonna use Mac's molar I've never
noticed how much I have to go over my
lash line and I think that's what
irritates my eyes makes them bloodshot
this is just like done truly amazing
just blackest creamiest eyeliner I swear
you guys I get in the pink as eyeshadows
soon and I've only owned it for six
weeks I actually love it oh my gosh this
color seer is this not just me
this color just me I love this color so
much so perfect so this is a makeup
prepper eyeshadow in the number and -
664 I will list it down below I know
like their numbering system can be kind
of tricky and complicated this is just
like a warm rusty kind of orange e
medium tone hot chocolate caramel brown
mmm I have been wearing this eyeshadow
constantly I have been putting it
underneath my eyes just to kind of buff
things out I've been wearing it and my
crease on days where I'm not doing tons
of makeup I will just take this and buff
it in the crease area and then that's
all I will do for eyeshadow because it's
just so beautiful it just gives so much
dimension to the eyes and if you have
brown or light eyes this color will
really complement them and make them
much brighter so I just absolutely I've
been wearing it constantly ESCA feels
like a week and a half ago and I have
been loving them ever since these are
the smashbox step-by-step contour sticks
so basically what it is is they come
with three of them in ops and there is a
contour a bronze and then a highlight so
they are just sticks that are cream
contour bronzes and highlights i'll show
you how they look right here this is the
contour color they are very pigmented
and very creamy and easy to blend out
there is the bronze which is a little
bit more like a terracotta
where the contour is much more like a
grey brown and the bronze is a much more
orange brown this highlight you're
probably not going to be will see very
well but it looks like that they blend
out super easy I got them just because I
wanted to try them just to kind of see
and I wasn't really expecting anything
too amazing I was hoping that they were
going to be amazing and they really did
blow me away and exceed my expectations
I've been loving loving that so boy the
way I've been using them is just putting
it like a small line of the contour one
right here and then a couple of lines
right here and then just blending it out
with a synthetic brush and done I
absolutely love it I just think that it
looks great I've been really into
contour recently with cream products I
haven't done
can try all the off-camera I've been
contouring with creams recently I just
love it that's what I did today
this is a makeup forever eyeliner and it
is called the ink liner and I wanted to
talk to you guys about this just because
of the simple fact that it is so
difficult to find a liquid eyeliner I
personally think that it's just black is
black and also dries matte and this says
on it eyeliner liquid matte matte liquid
eyeliner which i think is so important
because for me personally I'm a gel kind
of girl I just like applying gel liner
it's what's easiest for me I also think
that it gives like a really nice precise
sharp edge and it's just not as messy
but this is incredible this is a black
is black and it is matte as can be I do
not like it with an eyeliner look at how
black goes I don't like it when an
eyeliner dries and it has a shiny effect
to it I just like eyeliner to be
completely matte unless you're going
like a glittery eyeliner or something
like that but if you're doing a black
eyeliner i personally prefer a matte
lighter so i know i can't be the only
one so for those of you were looking for
a great black is black very matte
eyeliner i really recommend the make up
forever ink liner because is black and
it is matte i have been wearing this
blush this isn't my favorite blush for
the past two months i keep going back to
it it's just so beautiful and yes it is
a blush by Becca I swear I'm always
talking about Becca blushes but they're
one of my favorite formulations ever for
blushes and this is the blush songbird
it is kind of slightly resembling a
matte peachy keen but I like it even
better
this has like a bronzy kind of
terracotta feel but then it has a
gorgeous reflex shimmer of gold in it it
is just beautiful it's so bronzy it
warms up the face it just gives you a
glow and I have just been absolutely
loving this so this is Becca songbird
and what I really love about it is even
though it has a gold glow in it it's not
like intense on your face like boom
shimmer so if you're someone who is like
oh I don't want tons of shimmer my blush
this really just gives you a nice glow
as opposed to shimmer or highlight you
know what I'm saying so next I want to
talk about these eyeshadows and I have
had so many you guys asking me what my
opinion on these shadows
recently because I've seen that they
have been talked about quite a lot on
social media and I have been using them
now for about a month and a half and I
love them you guys like what are you
talking about then they are the color
pop eyeshadows and they are five dollars
apiece which is great because they are
such an amazing price and they're making
themselves quite known on social media
so I really really like them and what is
so interesting about them and they truly
feel like water like when your fingers
and them need to be careful because you
can truly just go wrong and like take
out the entire thing accidentally
because they're so squishy they feel
like a sponge it's so interesting but
just so cool and creative so I really do
like these the prices right they're
super super pigmented super pigmented
and every since of my born them I've had
no issues with them they stay on my eyes
all day they don't crease their grades
I'm going to show you look for my
favorite colors up close just so you can
see some of the swatches better
this is drift la la bandit and game face
this hair products has been everything
recently which you're not going to see
today because my hair has been flat as
can be but this is the living proof full
thickening cream and oh my gosh yes it
says Marissa on it is my friend who
works at Sephora she got this as gratis
she didn't want it and it ended up in my
hands absolutely love this it says body
view body boosting naturally moving for
all hair types oh my gosh it just like I
put like the size of a quarter in my
hand when it's wet I move throughout my
entire hair I brush it and I blow-dry
with my head upside down and I brush
through it and oh my gosh like I said
right now my hair is flat as can be but
this stuff truly if you are looking for
your hair just to all around have body
and fullness okay I'm so excited to be
talking about these products because
I've been using them for months and
haven't mentioned that and more
importantly my mom is going to be so
excited I'm finally mentioning these
because she has been in love with them
my mom has even posted about this brand
on her Instagram yes my mom is on
Instagram still weird to meet the
parents and grandparents are on
Instagram like what it's happening
though I'm rolling with it so this brand
is called the blissful body which as you
can tell by the name of the brand they
are body products she does body
moisturizers and body butters and let me
just say
body butters have ever used in my life
like my mom says I hope she doesn't go
to business because we will be buying
these butters until the day we die they
are incredible they're all-natural
they're all organic she makes them
herself the cents are incredible they
are light they are fresh the butters are
so creamy they're so moisturizing they
make your skin below there everything
that you could possibly want they're
good for your skin they're full of
nothing but good healthy ingredients
they're inexpensive as well for an
amazing body butter if you found this in
a store it would be $45 if you were to
go to Northshore Sephora and get this
body butter 25 bucks easy
no I only get down below the woman who
makes it is just the sweetest woman she
also gives a profit of all her I know
she also gives a portion of all of her
profit to an amazing organization to
help women so it's just a it's a great
place to put your money if you're
looking for a good body butter in this
kind of year everybody is looking for a
moisturizer because it is dry everywhere
so actually incredible the scents are so
subdued they're not overpowering they're
not intense and in-your-face I have the
lemon buttercream in the citrus vanilla
they're both so amazing the lemon
buttercream smells straight up like a
nice light lemon pound cake and the
vanilla citrus is like vanilla II I was
about to literally say vanilla E and
citrusy you think best body butters ever
I'm telling you ever I mentioned these
two in my last tutorial but I have to
mention them again because these two
combined have just been saving my life
recently this is the Chanel Leblanc
what is this LeBlanc de Chanel face
sheer illumining how come these
expensive brands you can never pronounce
anything on the bottle like what are you
saying to me basically this is a face
primer that is illuminating from Chanel
of course it's expensive because it's
Chanel but I've been on a primer kick
for the past month or two just trying
tons of them try to see if I can find
one that actually makes a difference and
honestly this is the only one that I've
tried that actually helps me with my
needs it may not help you with yours but
it helps me with mine because I am
looking for something that is going to
hydrate but also help keep my foundation
in place without sliding off if you are
looking for something that is pore
minimizing this is not it if you're
looking for something for oily skin this
is not it this is many for those of you
who are more dry you need some
illumination
elimination you need some illuminating
but you also want your foundation to
stay this has been working
wonders for me and I've also been mixing
it with this NARS what is this profile
and sit line and pore Perfector the
using is going to feed my videos as well
I put it in my little fine lines around
my mouth my smile lines I put it in
between my eyebrows in my forehead just
work any place if you get intense lines
you can even put it around your eyes and
I have been noticing a big difference
with this for my foundation is not
settling like it usually does because my
foundation always sells because I make
tons of facial expressions it's bound to
happen so these two together have just
been made in the shape I can't believe
that it took me so long into this video
to finally mention these but these are
the new makeup geek foiled eyeshadows
just these right here are the foil ones
all of these are just normal ones oh my
god you guys these foil eyeshadows are
off the wall of a fall they are
incredible I mean like even without a
primer on your eyes the pigmentation
these I know that I get excited about a
lot of products but honestly I'm not
kidding I've never ever ever use an
eyeshadow like these before where they
are just so creamy they go on so much
Halleck and so foiled without anything
needed I mean like without having to wet
your brush and without having to pack on
like a glitter glue or something like
these are just off the chain amazing
something that look at how gorgeous that
is like look at this green right here on
my finger and look at the pigment look
at this like in sane let me swatch this
beautiful royal blue purple for you like
the colors are just out of this world
she she is amazing like I am just so
proud to make a geek so so POW like I
swear there's going to make a geek
stores everywhere one day they're going
to be so loved Sephora Nordstrom
everywhere that woman deserves it like
the products keep getting better and
better these shadows are amazing I think
the best thing that mega peak has done
so far the last thing I have is totally
so random but I've been on a very big
organizing kick recently and try and
like make better use of the space that I
have with the stuff that I have and so
I've decided to keep my jewelry in my
closet here in my beauty room and so I
got on Amazon
found this three-tiered bracelet holder
and I just love this like it's something
that you would see like in a department
store that's displaying jewelry but I
just love it and the price was great it
was like 17 dollars I think for this and
they have all different ones they have
one that's just one tier or like they're
smaller bigger but I chose this one I
actually love it
and now I have these bracelets on
display like this I find that I wear
more of these bracelets because whether
I just laying out flat or like in a bin
or a drawer you don't see them as well
hanging up on this on display I am
actually wearing more of my jewelry so
I'm seeing what I have quicker and
easier so love it
best seventeen dollars no not the best
seventeen dollars I've ever spent but it
was it was a good way to spend $70 thank
you guys thank you so much for watching
this video you guys I know there was a
very long one again let me know if you
want an even longer one for my best of
beauty video for 2014 I will totally do
that for you by the way I know my
Christmas tree is still up I know we're
into January I have a very hard time
letting go Christmas okay I'm working
through my issues it'll be gone soon I
don't want to talk about it it's always
