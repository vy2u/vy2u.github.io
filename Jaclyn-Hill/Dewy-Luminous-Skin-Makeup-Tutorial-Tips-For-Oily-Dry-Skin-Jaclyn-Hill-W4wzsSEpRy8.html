a video on how to achieve really dewy
healthy luminous glowing skin we are
approaching much colder months right
ahead of us and with cooler weather
means drier skin so I wanted to do a
video on how you can really beat that
and still keep your skin looking healthy
and glowy and luminous all throughout
the cold winter months or if you're
someone like me and you want to look
dewy all year round that's cool too I am
going to be talking about those of you
who are oily as well not just for those
of you who are dry I want to achieve
this look but for those of you who are
oily and still want to have that really
beautiful looking glow without looking
like an oily monsters I get it there is
a difference between oil and just
straight-up being oily and actually
adding in highlight and adding that glow
to the skin where you want it to be
placed if that makes sense so I'm going
to be giving you guys lots of tips I'm
getting you my disclaimer right now I'm
really sorry if I talked 500 miles an
hour or this video is 45 minutes long
because I have a lot to get through but
I'm gonna try to go it as possible so
let's get started I'm actually recording
in my bedroom today I'm just sitting
like in the corner of my room but I told
you guys before I can't stand my
background I just want something new so
I thought I'll just sit here today or
whatever there are a lot of different
ways you can go and set that you can
take when you're trying to achieve a
dewy luminous looking skin so I'm going
to kind of go over a few of them with
you really quickly and then jump into
the actual tutorial of this video to try
to make it move along a little bit
quicker one of the first things I would
recommend is going in with a primer like
this one and this is the L'Oreal magic
lumi light infusing primer this is a
beautiful glowy primer that you can put
on the skin before going on with your
foundation and it will prime but it will
also give you that really beautiful
pearl essence that lays underneath your
foundation and slightly shines through
this is a method that I would really
recommend for those of you who are oily
because you can use your normal matte
foundation but this will give you just a
little bit of a glow something else you
can do is actually mix this in with your
foundation so one pump of this one pump
of your foundation swirl it together or
you can actually do a light infusing
primer a moisturizer and a foundation
and mix those all together like a little
cocktail in the back of your hand and
then use that as a foundation and that
will make you look so hydrated and
beautiful but at the same time since you
are using your normal matte foundation
it should keep you matte throughout the
day but still make you look hydrated in
a positive way another thing that you
can take is using just an overall
luminous foundation my absolute favorite
foundation
/ of light is the Giorgio Giorgio
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
I absolutely love this foundation and
for those of you who have sensitive skin
it's amazing and yes it is a high-end
brand and is expensive but this
foundation is one of the only ones I've
ever used that does not cause any
irritation any sensitivity any breakouts
any clogged pores nothing I almost feel
like my skin improves with this
foundation as silly as that seems so
using a foundation that reflects light
and has a luminosity to it will really
make you look nice and fresh and dewy
and youthful but at the same time if you
are more on the oily side you can use a
mattifying primer and that will kind of
help the oil from breaking through but
you can still use a foundation to really
make the skin look dewy while that
primer underneath of it holds back the
oil if that makes sense there's so many
little concoctions and tips that you can
use to make yourself look dewy and
luminous no matter what kind of skin you
have another step you can take is mixing
in an illuminizer with your foundation
you can use a matte foundation or a dewy
foundation for this if you use a
luminous more dewy foundation this is
going to be very very dewy which I
personally I'm all about that light but
that's up to you what you choose to do
so you can take one like this this is
the Josie Maran Argan illuminizer
this is the Drori Cosmetics BB +
illumination illumination and then this
one right here is the Becca opal and
this is the shimmering skin protector
illuminator SPF 25 these right here are
my three favorites when it comes to
liquid Luminizer 's you can mix these in
with your foundation to give yourself a
really beautiful glowy all over the face
glowy effect or once you have your
liquid foundation on before you go in
with any powder you can use these on the
tip of your finger or a synthetic brush
and just kind of tap it along the areas
that you want to highlight and this will
look really natural and dewy last step
in achieving that dewy luminous look is
setting your face with some sort of
setting spray and these two are my
favorite when it comes to wanting to
look more dewy and luminous how many
times things we're doing one video
honestly this is the Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray and this is cooling
and hydrating when you spray this on
your face it honestly feels just like a
breath of fresh air it's so amazing and
not only that it will help the makeup
last a little bit longer and it sets it
so if you've set your face with any
powder it'll kind of mix the powder with
the foundation
and really oxidize it to make it look
really fresh and beautiful and this
right here is mac fix+
if you want to be doing spray this right
here this bitch will make you do me for
days I'm telling you you can do makeup
however you want drench your face in
this and you're going to glow it so the
first thing I'm going to do is apply the
L'Oreal magic Lumi primer it looks like
this on the back of the hand very white
very liquidy and when you mix it
together it honestly has like a pearl
essence to it it's just very pretty and
it's not too much to the point that it's
overwhelming and even though it is white
you darker skin tones can still use this
because it's laying underneath in the
foundation not on top so it's just going
to shine through and get a really
beautiful glow along as a highlight and
like I mentioned before you can mix this
in with your foundation if you want I
actually love mixing primers and with
foundations because it actually shares
out the foundation in a little bit while
still priming the face and especially
with one like this it just gives that
beautiful luminosity now what I'm going
to be doing is applying my foundation
and I'm going to be mixing in the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector and a shade
opal this is this does come in three
different shades I believe it's
moonstone opal and topaz so light medium
and dark so there is a shade in there
for everybody this is honestly just such
a beautiful Luminizer it's so creamy and
just rich and luxurious I absolutely
love it so I'm going to do two pumps of
this let's get real I'm going to do
three and then I'm going to just take
two pumps of this and mix it in you
always want to do a actually I'm only
going to do one full pump because that's
a big pump you always want to do less of
the highlighter than you do of the
foundation just to kind of even it out
and make it look a little bit more
natural so now I was going to mix this
on the back of my hand and make a nice
rich luxurious Dubey cocktail mmm
cocktail sounds good okay so now that I
have got my finger I was going to wipe
that on the lower area of my face then
I'm going to take mac fix+ and I'm going
to spray it directly on the foundation
brush mac fix+ is a setting spray that's
going to help set the makeup and make it
look really dewy and natural and healthy
I like spraying on the actual brush
before going in and blending up my
foundation because that way it makes the
entire face just look really beautiful
and healthy as opposed to just setting
it at the end
oh my gosh looks already Foundation is
my favorite thing every single day when
I apply my foundation I'm just like ah
yes doing this because I'm usually so
matte and dry it just it always feels
good to get on some hydrating foundation
so I did the chin area and the cheek
area with two sprays of the mac fix+ so
I was going to spray by brush two more
times and then just do the nose and
forehead area if you are very oily then
you're going to probably want to avoid
this step of spring fix plus on your
brush because it's just going to
honestly accentuate the oil but for
those of you who are normal to dry this
will really benefit your dry skin and
make it look really beautiful look at
how much foundation I have left over oh
so wasteful whenever I have foundation
like this like tons of it leftover I'll
just take a little bit of it and just
kind of bring it down in this area
instead of just wiping it off my hand
like why not I'll just paint my neck as
well now I'm going to be applying my
concealer and I'm going to be using a
damp Beauty Blender to do so all you
want to do is grab your Beauty Blender
hold it underneath the sink and squeeze
it about 15 times in a row and you'll
feel it expand in your hand once it gets
to the maximum size which this is the
maximum size right here you're going to
want to put it in a paper towel or any
towel that you have and just squeeze out
the excess water and then you're good to
go I know it sounds like it takes a lot
of work but it's really not
I love applying my under eye concealer
with a Beauty Blender because of the
fact that it's just slightly damp it's
just very hydrating it feels very
refreshing on the under eye area and not
to mention if you get too heavy-handed
and you apply too much concealer this
will soak up the excess which will help
avoid that cakiness if you can get under
there that crepeiness and it won't
crease in the under eye fine lines that
we all have so I really recommend a
Beauty Blender for under-eye area I also
like it for foundation but just not as
much as a synthetic flat top brush so
that's just me I cannot find my NARS
concealer anywhere that I've been using
recently which is driving me crazy so
instead I'm going to be using this
chanel corrector and number 20
underneath my eye area I would like to
use the NARS one that's why I prefer
because it just has a really beautiful
natural-looking effect and the Mac Pro
Longwear is a little bit too dry if
you're going for something a little bit
more glowy
my gosh I cannot stand what I'm looking
at my video footage and I'm like this
applying my concealer on my girl get it
together close that mouth when you're
using a Beauty Blender don't actually
rub just dab and press and this will
push all of that product into the skin
along with taking away any excess
product that you might have
so now I'm just going to set my under
eye area with just a little bit of
powder and I absolutely have to do this
because if I don't any mascara that I
put my lower lashes my lower lashes
touch my skin under here and it will
just take that mascara and still get
right up and it's just the hot mess and
I have black mascara not cute so I'm
just going to be using the anastasia
banana powder from her contour kit and i
was going to take a little bit of it on
a sigma tapered highlighting brush and
just dab right in this area i'm not
going to bring this down because i
really don't want to get rid of that
dewy effect that we have on the under
eye area i'm just going to put this
right here to avoid any creasing or
smudging with any eye makeup using a
yellow base powder like this works for a
lot of different skin tones because it
gives a really beautiful brightening
effect so now to finish this off i'm
going to be using in ambient lighting
powder from hourglass in the shade a
luminous light i have talked about this
a couple of times it is just so absolute
aful and what i love about this it is a
very subtle highlighter that truly looks
like you are just glowing from within
and i cannot say that enough it is so
beautiful it is so picture perfect for a
bride it's just gorgeous I really really
recommend this highlighter to those of
you who are oily because it's not
over-the-top it's not going to be too
much or crazy it just looks so beautiful
and luminous again I'm taking a sigma
tapered highlighter brush and I'm going
to put this all along the tops of the
cheeks oh when I highlight this area I
go from the brow area and I swoop it
around and I go down towards the nose
area do you see how gorgeous this is it
seriously it's just so finely melded it
does not look like shimmer or sparkle or
glitter it just looks like the light is
just catching you and it looks like you
just spent the day outside and you're
just nice and dewy it just looks like
you've been taking your vitamins I'm
going to also just dab this on the chin
area again if you are oily and you get
oily in this area you do not have to do
this bar I'm also going to drag it on
the Cupid's bow drag it on the top of
the Cupid's bow will actually help bring
more pronunciation to the lips and
actually make them look a little bit
fuller and I will take a tiny bit of it
and just drag it right there on the
forehead again if you're oily your not
going to highlight the t-zone area of
course but I am NOT oily and I just want
that natural looking luminosity
again this highlighter is just so
natural-looking that you can pretty much
dust it all over your face
and you're just gonna look glowing
you're not gonna look like oh you were
highlighted okay so at this point I was
going to go to my makeup room and just
put on a little bit more makeup to
finish off my face and then I will be
back in just a minute alright so I am
back and I have finished the rest of my
makeup and then just to finish this off
I'm going to just set my face with a
makeup setting spray and today I'm going
to be using the mac fix+ just because
this really gives you a very intense
dewy luminous finish as opposed to this
one it's not as intense more than
anything I'd like this one just sets
your makeup but this one really gives
you a luminous finish that was intense
so now what I have to do is I have to
look forward so that my lashes do not
touch my face because if they touch to
my face I will get mascara everywhere so
I have to sit here like this for about a
minute and a half and just let that dry
and just fin it off are you guys so we
are all finished at this point like I
said you do not have to do every single
step that I just did figure out what
your skin type is and what your skin
type needs and go from there if you're
more oily you may want to use a matte
foundation and you could still mix some
shimmer in it or you could just use the
primer or you can mix the primer with
the foundation or you could just do a
powder highlight like I use with the
hourglass ambient lighting powder you
just figure out what works for you and
do you I just want to show you the whole
production and all the different steps
that you could take to making yourself
look dewy luminous glowing all those
great things so yeah I really hope that
you guys enjoy this video and also
