are you referring to because I can't
just say oh it's my palette as if I'm
just like you know anyways for today's
video everything that you see on my face
right now is either from the drugstore
or it is affordable I think I cheated
one time I use my like eyeliner in here
isn't from the drugstore but the
majority of everything on my face is the
drugstore and whatever isn't drugstore
is affordable I have to say I found some
things I really loved today like this
foundation and concealer that I'm
wearing I absolutely love and the brow
pencil finally found a drugstore brow
pencil that I love my subscribers here
you guys know the journey I have never
been able to find a brow pencil I
actually enjoyed the drugstore until two
day so yes I hope you guys enjoy this
tutorial I love you guys so much and

their prime my skin I'm using the NYX
angel veil primer oh Babylonia I cannot
tell you how bad my nails look this is
like truly if I got embarrassed easily I
would be embarrassed right now okay so
I'm finally gonna be using this Milani
conceal and perfect foundation it says
it's a two-in-one foundation and
concealer I've heard such great things
about it but I haven't actually given it
like a real try love the way it feels in
the back of my hand like I feel like
it's gonna be really full coverage it's
nice I kind of missed not having nails
like when I have like this broken nail
right here and it's just like my bare
nail I kind of miss it I think you can
do so much more when I just have like no
nail at all um when I did my drugstore
haul and I mentioned this foundation
there were tons of people in the comment
section there were like talk he loves
that talked he loves that
and if talk to him something I love
something I just feel like she is she's
one of the real ones you know like
everything
recommend I go out and I buy and I'm
like yes it's exactly how she explains
it exactly what she says it's going to
be like she's never let me down oh my
gosh the coverage on this foundation is
absolutely ridonculous I'm getting
really happy today it's just such a
typical Monday my phone will not stop
going off I think my sister thought that
I was losing my mind when I told her
that I was filming she's like on a
Monday there's kind of like blew off
everything else that I was supposed to
do to film looks but I just really need
to get back in my groove you know like
I'm over it like I'm really disappointed
in myself for how much I have slept on
YouTube moving into a new house a new
environment that I got rid of my old
office space I had to move all my stuff
to my condo and I knew through my condo
into my new house and then there's just
been a lot of traveling and there's been
a lot going on in my personal life and a
lot going on with stuff that you guys
will see down the road I can't talk
about quite yeah there's just been so
much and then you guys know like the
pink elephant in the room all this drum
on social media recently like it's just
really gotten really discourage me and
so I would disappointed in myself for
neglecting YouTube at all because it is
my first love my first passion you know
before developing makeup or
collaborations or anything like this was
my heart and it made me so happy
and it makes me really sad that I lost
that for a while and just let negativity
kind of cloud my thoughts you know and
just get into my head in the first place
and I am sorry for that and I'm
disappointed myself for that you know
and I just like there's so many people
out there that misunderstand me and I
just don't know my heart and they they
twist my words and they make me seem
like such a terrible person it just gets
under my skin even though I know who I
am it still bothers me but at the end of
the day like it is my fault I choose to
put myself out there and it is what it
is happens and I'm just gonna keep
going try to keep learning keep trying
to be the best person that I can be like
I always have and just keep growing you
know and in the meantime I'm going to
work as hard as I possibly can on
YouTube even though I am so damn busy
because I do love you guys and this is
what got me to where I am so yeah I'm
just saying more all the story is on
back bitches I'm not even kidding
this foundation right now on my skin
so is Lily excited I got this package in
the mail from lore'l and it's their new
and fallible Pro below powder their
long-wear powder and concealer so I was
really really excited at the concealers
right here so I'm gonna use these today
I'm gonna try a shade for natural beige
this wand is so delicate oh oh my god oh
my god I've seen my eye oh crap oh crap
oh my gosh it's like actually singing my
eye hold on there's like a scent coming
off oh it's burning my skin okay hold on
I know it's nice to go out we're gonna
try it ah I'm gonna try to buff it in
and see what happens
oh this is actually stinging my skin
okay no I can't do this oh what's that
oh wow so the pro glow is a no-go for me
but I found some maybelline superstay
better skin concealers in my collection
I also found me color pop no filter
concealer so I'm gonna start off with
the color pop don't tell her how to try
this yet so we shall see that's so weird
that that concealer how that reaction
like I wonder why it's done was so bad
like it still stings like I'm applying
this concealer it actually feels kind of
nice it feels like soothing to it I
don't like rubbing it across the area
like my whole under eye still what
really really burns its strength never
had that kind of reaction before and I
have a really sensitive skin I have been
obsessed with the movie friend with
benefits recently it's what's playing on
my iPad right now and just sitting over
in the corner I know your face is where
I watch on different movies as I get
ready oh crap my under eye really hurts
please let me know the comments down
below if any of you are like happiness
I'm gonna look it up afterwards to see
if this is like a common thing or I'm
just like a freak of nature who this
happened to but it's weird that it stung
my eye firstly burned my actual eyeball
like they're like fumes and then it
start burning my skin so it's a really
strange
anyways I feel bad though I hate talking
negatively about any products alright
listen up
gonna make a true statement this right
here is my favorite drugstore foundation
concealer combination that I think I've
ever seen on my face before
Grant said I have not set with powder
and granted I have not working out the
day but just applying it holding luck a
moly you know what I'm gonna just go in
with the trusty L'Oreal True Match
powder this is how I've been applying
powder recently I'm used like a smaller
brush like wispier and I just like
barely Pat the powder onto my face and
it just like allows me to keep a glow
throughout the day as opposed to making
myself so mad that it's like chalkboard
Mac so I just like barely touch my face
with the powder just to set it but not
really fully mattify my ass all right
I'm going to do my eyebrows I'm going to
be using the Loreal brow stylist shape
and fill triangular pencil so I was
really excited when I saw this because
it reminds me so much of the Anastacio
brow definer and I have really high
hopes for this fingers crossed I am NOT
against this
alright brows are now done and I have to
say I finally have a drugstore brow
winner right here I crown thee the
winner of the drugstore not keep in mind
that my favorite brow pencil in general
and the Anastacio brow definer and this
is the most similar the only thing is
that the spoolie on this is not as
strong and stiff I have a stiff spoolie
love is the V J I could do one damn
video without being disgusting alright
before I go in with my eyeshadow I'm
just going to put some traces of powder
all over my face really quickly to catch
any fallout so I'm going to be using a
lot of product so I'm just gonna stand
this and this something real to you guys
might look traces of powder I'm using
right now is not from the drugstore it's
just what stay on my Vande but any
transit powder will work this step isn't
even necessary for this I just want to
be extra precautious I'm gonna grab this
palette right here that was created by
some bitch alright her shade I'm gonna
go in with today is creamsicle these
nails I am sorry
alright so I'm gonna pick up creamsicle
on a fluffy brush and just go ahead and
that in the transition area of my eye
the reason I'm applying this yellowy
orange shade first is because once we
have on all those other colors this
color are just gonna kind of beam
through from the very bottom and just
tie it all together and give it like
that oh that it needs to go in with the
shade cue key right here in the center
of the palette it's a really really
mustardy Brown I'm just gonna put that
right kind of on top of that color just
a little bit beneath it I always start
off with the lightest color of the
highest and then I go darker down down
down honest to God I know that I just
started this look but I can already tell
that I'm gonna be freaking obsessed like
you know what you just feel it like I'm
just feeling it right now I'm gonna go
in with this shade Central Park right
here in my last video I called it
Central Perk and that's because it's
what I wanted to originally name it
because of the show friends but I
couldn't so we call it Central Park
instead but that's where it did come
from so I still actually call it Central
Park all the time I'm gonna mix it with
a little bit of mocha because I don't
want it to be too too dark
all right so now for the fun part I'm
gonna go in with the shade diva which is
right right here you have no idea what a
pain this color was to develop I went
back and forth him the so many times
because I wanted to create a green that
did not just look exclusive to Christmas
like a year-round green that wasn't
really a forest green there wasn't a
hunter green and wasn't a Christmasy
green it took me a really really long
time to be happy with this color and I
just I'm obsessed with it I'm gonna
spritz my brush with a little bit of
fixed plus this is not necessary at all
to do but I just do it with basically
every single metallic I ever use at this
point cuz I just want like that extra
pop but I'm just going to place this all
over my lid oh my god this color like I
forgot how much I love this color
alright now I'm going to go in with the
shade enchanted which is this really
really deep matte oops are these you
look it's really really deep matte green
right here I'm gonna put that on a
fluffy brush and just put that right in
my crease kind of over top of where
those two colors meet oh my god I am
living for this right now
alright now I'm going to grab a little
bit of the shade pool party right here
which is a matte very like aqua with a
green undertone in it I'm just on a
fluffy brush I'm just going to Pat that
really really a lightly actually less
than that really really lightly on that
outer corner with a shimmery green and
the matte green meat
all right it's gonna wipe all this away
oh this is a laugh all right I was gonna
hit the grab bone with some highlight
I'm using the first shade in the palette
which is in light okay so for the lower
lash line I'm gonna go back in with
creamsicle and cuqui these two shades
and just mix them together on a pencil
brush
all right and then I'm gonna take a
Central Park that dark brown on a stiff
brush like this I'm gonna put it really
tight on my lash line so then with a
really tiny pencil brush I'm gonna blend
those two shades together that way you
don't see like the harsh line or the
dark brown that I want to be very blown
out and soft all right so I do not have
any white or creamy white eyeliner
anywhere that is like from the drugstore
or like colour-pop or something so I'm
just going to use the same one I always
use by Mac I'm sure that they are made
I'm sure there's drugstore brands who
have cream you eye liners I just don't
personally own one so let's just pretend
because for this look you could do black
in your inner rim or you could do
nothing in your inner rim but I don't
want to be too smoky and too intense so
that's why I'm gonna go in with a light
creamy color on my waterline I feel like
that like ties the look together like it
brings it to where I want it to be all
right let me put on some mascara really
quickly and I'm gonna pop on some false
lashes you totally do not have to do
false lashes if you're comfortable
without them but I'm not because I have
just trained myself to always think that
I need a lash okay so now for the face I
wish that I could find my butter bronzer
by Physicians Formula
because it's my favorite drugstore
bronzer ever and smelled just like
happiness instead I'm gonna be using the
NYC smooth skin bronzing face powder
right here and it mix it with a L'Oreal
True Match which is just a regular face
power and the shade 6.5 cuz this one is
little bit darker so I'm gonna mix those
two together to create a bronze color
I really want like a mommy of a lush
shade and in my collection this is the
one that I could find that's the closest
around looking for all my other one is
like very pink and corley and I really
want something that's mommy so I'm gonna
go in with this elf in the shade mellow
mom oh my god how funny is that that's
the name I'm not really getting much
pigment from this blush to be honest
which is weird because I've used elf
blushes before in the past and I've
always really liked them but I'm not
really getting much from this one I'm
gonna go in with this NYX one let's see
about this right here this is definitely
way more coral this is in the shade pink
in the town I'm just gonna use a dad
with this cuz these are usually yeah
these are really pigments in it for
highlight I am thinking I'm gonna use
the wet and wild precious petals let's
see how this goes I have used this
before but I think I was a lot Hanner
than this so I don't know how this is
gonna work with my skin tone currently
but let's find out oh yeah it looks
really nice I have so much texture on
this side of my face I cannot get over
it
like I'm just covering texture on my
left side
okay so now my lips I'm gonna start off
by going in with Kat Von D I'm gonna Kat
Von D mood recently I have to say I'm
gonna go in with the shade sanctuary you
know this color is beautiful
alright now I'm gonna set my face and
I'm going to use the Maybelline a master
fix the setting spray right here okay
guys I just realized I'm so upset that
the lip color that I put on it's not a
drugstore or affordable I don't know why
I was stupid and I caught it now that I
summed my outro my intro and when I sat
down I started snack and I went outside
took pictures and an hour and half later
I'm like wait a second this is not
affordable on my lips right now so my
it's gonna come back on camera and say
we're gonna change that really quickly
and give you an affordable alternative
because I decide bad I feel guilty so I
found this color from the L'Oreal
infallible Pro matte liquid lipsticks
are right here and it is basically the
exact same shade as what is on my lips
so if I wonder if I put it on right over
top it oh my god
look at this like look at that that's
the exact same color is what I have my
looks identical so this is in the shade
milk and cookies so I'm sorry I made
that mistake but crisis averted it has
now been corrected whoo now I'm just
getting excited this one is really
pretty too
this is in the shade and gora I wanna
put this on our tarts to see oh my god
okay I actually think this might be my
favorite one this video has officially
turned into a lip swatching video but
they sent me all their colors right here
in a PR package and I have to say their
colors are fleeky this shade is
shakedown is the name of it oh my gosh I
think I actually gonna leave this one on
because I think this is my favorite
right now it's just like perfect it's
not red it's not brown it's like right
there between like I'm into this are you
guys so I am officially done I am
signing out now I hope that you enjoy
and there's a video even with all of the
lips mishaps we finally got to a color
that I actually really love like yes I
love this color this is really beautiful
okay I'm done I let me thank you for
watching and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
