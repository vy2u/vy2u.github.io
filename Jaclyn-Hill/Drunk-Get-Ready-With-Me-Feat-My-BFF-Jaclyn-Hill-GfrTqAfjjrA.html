note hey guys welcome back I was ready
yeah welcome back to my channel for
today's video I have a very special
guest see I'm getting better not
interrupting people I am going to be
doing one of the most if not the most
requested video of all time here on my
channel for the past couple of years
actually by just one night I wanted to
do it it feels so weird and I because
getting drunk by yourself and doing it
all just seems like something that only
depressed people do and you know I
struggle with depression I thought that
I would bring one of my bestest friends
and miss Jackie Reilly here at my
channel to just accompany make me feel a
little bit better about just getting
drunk and doing absolute nothing with my
leg but unfortunately we're both we're
both um crazy that is unfortunate part
of life I'm like very sober I need to
get there get there
what's retrograde your tongue retrograde
um it affects like things like your your
money it can affect things and
technology things moving and right now
we're in a retrograde I can I blame my
acne on that sure fuck it done this is
so yellow that it's a hint of green get
there honey you there yeah this is to
Baia actually my main scene you know
it's about situation
look at this fact that we have this
whole thing right now
wait my eyes are red at the devil's dick
right now bitch only hangin yeah here's
the thing you asked for a drunk story oh
this is what comes hi Kennedy I love you
so much just I love you my question is
what is celebrities makeup would you do
dead or alive ah I love that I mean that
first person what she said they're alive
I think of his Marilyn Monroe my pass
would be Brigitte Bardot oh yes you
would alive is hard but I can I can pick
one I would pick god this is gonna be so
cliche but I'm just gonna go for the
first answer that came from my brain and
I'm gonna go with Megan Fox oh honey she
is hot no I would make it work let's do
Ruby Roses makeup looks like umm :
Johnny Depp Angelina Jolie and candy
Johnson had a try so pretty it's
ridiculous onsen is honestly one of the
prettiest just humans I've ever seen my
life take your breath away like caramel
is so pretty on camera but in person
you're right in person you're just like
the limit does not exist I think the
alcohol is finally kicking Jackie do you
see my skin out of there have 95 years
old come on click it up yeah maybe I'll
start seeing yeah I look better the more
a drink click it up pick it up what
about fallout there's not gonna be much
fault cuz I'm gonna be using my palette
good thanks I'm taking a five-second
break Jesus I'm on bitch I've been on
and I'm wasted no I really have it's a
fucked up situation fucked but I'm doing
it for you Ben I'm here
I told why did you make it look better
than mine and you're so much younger
than me I don't know what's happening
I'm like why do I make a fuss when I
watch Titanic when I was in Turks you
fool she gave up on him at the end you
can't find another piece of debris for
him to find another both literally meet
John my whole family could have sit on
that on that door she's a no I hate her
I love anything in her we just started
watching Kylie show and we loved it and
we were really kind of hesitant cause
like you know if you just watch the
Kardashians and you just look at social
media sometimes you're just like a judge
people ever say started YouTube I don't
believe anything I'm just like oh look
you just really don't know but Kylie on
the other hand it wasn't so much the
media and like stories it was just like
the way she portrayed herself on
Instagram I think anything's so young
you don't mean to judge but there's
something that I think us girls kind of
do which I like to check I think we both
keep each other in check and you'd be
like that kind of Judge eNOS yes but
then it's good to just be like think
about when you were 18 like you don't
know mean like Jackson do burly
everyone hates Justin Bieber so much but
like when I heard like he had like a
Lamborghini he's got a DUI and all this
stuff and everyone's like oh my god he's
this he's that I'm like if you were 18
years old and had to how a million
dollars what would you know you'd be
doing stupid - it's like really was it
cash during the point is that we like
Kylie we really like Kylie and we really
like Jordan yes we're into both of them
oh my god I look like I'm 108 years old
I don't think that's a safe place for
that it's definitely not but I should I
need a quick dance break
jack-jack
actually I'm not that drunk I'm really
not like I'm really not like I'm fine
well she has done
we have a guest we have a guest on the
show go speed round down you remember
the first brand that sent you PR yeah um
a Nastasia in the letter that she said
she was like my daughter more vino looks
just like you and she hears that and
that's how we found you so they found me
because apparently we looked like each
other no you do know each other and so
they were like getting tagged on social
media and after they found me they reach
out to me and that's when I was out like
40,000 subscribers and it was amazing
Jacqueline Hill what's your favorite
thing about Jackie Reilly and vice versa
I know mine I know mine you go first
alright my favorite thing about Jackie
is that she gets me out of my comfort
zone you knew this was coming because I
always thank you for this yeah you do
Jackie makes me like try new things she
makes me look at the world in a
different way I could just text Jackie
and be like hey what are you doing
tonight like a brand new Indian
restaurant opened up like I heard a
couple people got food poisoning and but
like it's supposed to be bomb wanna try
it and she did yeah I'll be ready at
7:00 like Jackie's always ready training
I'm always ready to try anything yeah
and it inspires me to want to try any
things myself and just get to my comfort
zone and when I'm really stressed and
really trapped like in my own world and
social media like Jackie is the one who
typically always breaks me out I would
say my favorite thing about you is
definitely just your true confidence
it's one of those things especially as
women that a lot of us don't and as soon
as you do start to believe in yourself
like the world is your oyster like you
can do anything so I love that
Jacqueline truly believes in herself
because I just think that all of us need
a little bit more of that and I love
that Jacqueline truly isn't cocky she
just believed herself so that's my
favorite thing I believe in you just so
much as I believe in me what is one
thing about Jacqueline that we don't
know if I had to say something that a
lot of people don't realize about
Jacqueline she truly is such a
bleeding-heart she always says I'm
cleaning art but she's truly the meeting
bleeding-heart excuse me because she
just loves to give and she loves to make
people smile like everyone that's in her
circle of friends and family
she just always wants to make them feel
special and she'll be really quiet and
she'll hear something you say like six
months ago and next thing you know like
she'll make that dream come true for you
it's amazing like so I think that's
something that people don't realize that
you were such a nice caring person truly
we're not making out love you
what was your most embarrassing moment
ever Gisela asked me and my ex-boyfriend
Oh God we went to Moe's and we got um
Mexican food and we with the cold stone
we had ice cream for dessert and you
know where this is going and then we
drove home and my parents were gone so
we walked in the house and I'm like oh
my god like I really have to run
bathroom like bad like what I told you
that it hit me hard
I was like whoa walk into my parents
bedroom
you've fuzzies on your face you're good
I got you helping bitch out right shut
their doors like honey I was in white
shorts and I didn't make it I went to
the bathroom I clean myself up of course
like a lady like I'm like what do I do
what I do
I think it's how I know if you have this
moment they probably have it but that's
okay I'm not a shit but pull the Attar
on my waist like oh my god what do I do
my boyfriend like boom opens at the door
does it what are you doing and I was
like haha and I threw my shorts so fast
that he couldn't see like I look and the
second I heard him trying to open the
door I threw the shorts across my
parents room so far any open the door
he's what are you doing Isaac nothing
I'm trying to play it cool
he's riding on a towel and I don't know
I made up some stupid lie that he
believed cuz he was stupid too we go out
to the couch or like I just out there in
my own style and pain so my parents get
fired like thirty minutes later my dad
was in the bedroom and he comes walking
out holding into my white shorts in his
hand and he's like Jacqueline what is
this

life wanted to die you wanted to die

for such an asshole as it was accused

live your life truly without filling in
your hairline um well Jax let's just I
know everyone's been thinking about it
the whole time they're like why is

make this blue color work and it takes
three washes and it turns green and then
my roots come in and I don't know why I

healer because concealer really makes a
difference do you see how I'm coming to
life right now as I'm doing this can I
just say something

concealer to contour it was a bad bad
decision on my part and I just want to
say that I understand that and I won't
make that mistake again
