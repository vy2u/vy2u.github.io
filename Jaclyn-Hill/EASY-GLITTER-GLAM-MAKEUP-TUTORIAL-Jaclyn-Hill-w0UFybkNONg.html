today's video I'm going to be doing a
very in-depth step-by-step how to talk
your tutorial on this listen to seeing
right here I have pretty much awareness
looking non-stop the past 2 to have
weeks or so in terms of to the nudes of
the goals of the glossy list sometimes
I'll put a ton of literary sometimes
I'll put barely any glitter but I have
just gotten so fast at this well because
it honestly is such a minimal product
it's so easy that I can do this in 15 to
20 minutes top 20 minutes and I'm just
out the door like I can do with my eyes
closed at this point honestly like it's
very different than things that I
normally do I am even that a liquid
headache today and basing a cream
bronzer I'm barely using any concealer
whatsoever I've even used eye primer on
my eye or concealer on my eyes literally
just glitter and brow bone highlight and
mascara like so simple but I just look
so glam and appropriate for really any
occasion if you want to dress it up or
dress it down I'm doing it by your guys
request so I really hope that you
enjoyed also I would really love your
opinion on this backdrop right here
because this is my first time ever
filming a video here on my channel that
has a matte flat paper background now I
love this color purple like so what it
makes me so happy but I always either do
like a glitter backdrop or like just me
sitting in my house so I don't know how
I feel about this I keep looking my
viewfinder in like is this me I don't
know why distilling is what everyone is
doing on YouTube right now Simon okay I
gotta give a shot like I bought four
different colors if you like let's see
how it is please let me know if you
enjoyed this kind of backdrops because
sometimes when I'm watching videos I
feel like I do like it cuz I can pay
more attention to what they're doing
because it's just been with another type
of Caroline I wanna see you in your home
you know like give me the real deal
so let me know how you guys feel about
me incorporating these backdrops I know
you'll be honest with me some of you
might be a little too much with me but
that's all right
so anyways did you guys enjoy this video
if you do please subscribe to my channel
you know how much I appreciate you guys
and love you so much
so you guys you got to get this look
then just keep watching it hi okay so
first things first I bring attention to
it let's address people
in the room the elephant being my lips I
know they are very swollen right now
very engorged and I have bruises down
here from getting lip injections yeah
I have to get him the filler for about a
year at this point and I got ketchup
three days ago
and I did have a little bruising down
here so that is what you see they are
all so swollen and a little uneven which
is kind of what happened after you get
them done your lips are coming tick-tock
oh yes they my toes a little weird right
now but that's okay it's temporary I'm
still going to film the show is still
going to go on but you know I just feel
like I'm on a mission to have like
balloon lips imagine like a giant
balloon a child's birthday party like
that my dream board from my lips Oh God
oh my I look back at my videos what I
have you like Chaplin Chaplin sweetie
honey what were you thinking what did
you do to your face but in the meantime
it's temporary and come on zoom I'll
sign again I start off by priming my
face you use whatever primer you have
and you love it can also be a
moisturizer if you have a great
moisturizer that you love and you feel
like it's super got like a nice
thickness to it or maybe it's really
mattify you can also use that it's just
good to have something on your face and
not built in with foundation or
concealer on a completely dry flat
spacious because foundation really
having you to stick and hold on to
throughout the day so slash something on
that bitch and let's move forward okay
now I'm going to pick up foundation I'm
going to go in with the Dior forever
foundation because as you guys know
though I am beyond the sets my favorite
foundation at the moment then just dab
this around my face to get off my finger
I'm going in with a cover-up at liquid
foundation brush I like it and I'm
obsessed with it like it's a nice brush
it's nice and small compact such a guy
can really work with products into my
skin it does take longer when using a
smaller brush to do your foundation of
course the foundation is a little bit
darker than my face but as you can see
it's going to match my neck my face is
really white and really fair and has it
kind of like a pinkish undertone Anette
looking breakouts right here okay but
once I get the foundation on my face it
will match my next purposely the reason
my things is always so much lighter than
my body well most of the time it is
because I do get spray tan and ela as
joget spray cans my face is always lying
on my body and I'm convinced because I
use so many brightening products
brightening moisturizer threatening
exfoliator brightening mask and then I'm
also exfoliating my face about three
times a week so my skin is always a
shade lighter than the rest of my body
I'm going to barely put this on my
actual lid like I'm talking bear Lee I
want you to actually still be able to
see the daned I just don't want it to be
a complete different color than the rest
of my faces I am so much lighter if you
are applying a foundation it's the exact
same shade so I can't talk properly
today if you already applied the
examination is the exact same shade as
your skin you not even worry about going
over your lids just leave that
completely blank okay next I'm going to
fill in my brows and for today's look
I'm going to feel that in totally
different than I normally do typically
I'll draw a line in the very front I'll
bring it out I'll buff it up I'll blend
blend blend for today I'm actually only
going to fill in the spot where there's
actually hair missing it truly needs the
fullness I want to keep it as natural
looking as possible so whatever your
natural brow routine is just do that for
today's look now I'm going to go a with
these smashbox step-by-step contour
stick this is just a giant crayon in the
shade bronze it comes in a little pack
with all three of them it's bronze
contour and highlight you're literally
going to follow the shadow of my
cheekbone which is like right about here
start one line
a man grabbed a little do a fiber brush
to blend that out with a Mac 130 and I'm
going to begin to it just go straight
back and forth and then once we have
that line buffed out a little bit I'll
go in like little tiny circular motions
I want to keep that color in its place
as much as possible for I don't like
take that like a new with all around the
place if I want to continue to stay on
the line that I created and I've talked
about this before but honestly you do
not need like sticks like this to do
this method at all honestly you can go
to the drugstore pick up on your
favorite foundations I would suggest
something kind of on the more mass to
natural size might be original L'Oreal
True Match just get that in a darker
shade in your skin get it like four or
five shades darker take a drop of it and
just boop-boop-boop dot on your face and
go ahead and blend it out and you'll be
the exact same outcome you do not need
like a stick foundation you do not need
a plan like this you could honor please
get a foundation a couple shades darker
and it will do the trick
alright I'm going to take that I'm gonna
draw some lines up on my forehead we do
not want a pale forehead I never want to
leave this area alone
this will just overall make the face
look so much more put together and
define okay now only because I'm high
maintenance I'm going to grab some of
this Chanel screen bronze owes to the
solo so they can - nama I'm going to go
ahead and pick this up on just a buffer
brush I just like this off as best as I
could because I don't know why normally
this Smashbox stick looks better but for
some reason today I'm having that kind
of bad makeup base if you will like you
have bad hair day sometimes sometimes
I've had bad makeup days in the same
product just kind of turn on you know
Mike what the hell so I'm going to dab
some of this over top and then blend
that out and this will make it look
smoother honestly by additional bronzer
is one of those products even though it
is very expensive at the luxury brand of
course it's Chanel I honestly think it
is so necessary like it's in my top
three must-haves from luxury brands as
far as cosmetics go you guys know if
you've been watching my channel for a
long time I have been using this for
years and never gets old I think it's
crazy every time I put it on okay
that was mo bettah now I'm going to just
grab that highlighting pick from
Smashbox and I'm
going to draw a line and I'm going to
just color this and I know this routine
seems complex but funny enough when I'm
actually doing it off camera it's so
fast and so easy I don't think of it as
complex I'm going to go back in with
that same brush I used to apply the
foundation I'm just going to blend that
in this will just make the lower half
the face look way cleaner and way more
put together obviously you don't want to
leave a harsh line like that so we're
going to go in and just lightly blend
that out blend it out to a point where
it looks nice and natural and you don't
have any harsh lines you don't really
want to see like where the bronzer end
and where it begins you want everything
to kind of say that it's ombre effect
it's a more concealer a lot of times I
do this look I don't even apply a
concealer I just go ahead and move
forward at this point if you do want to
different dealers we wanted to take very
small amounts you don't want anything to
get kicked up or be too heavy
so I'm literally going to do say dots in
the inner corner of my eye and then just
blend it out ever so lightly and I have
an exhaustive recently so I do have a
little bit of discoloration underneath
my eyes more than normal so I will put a
def underneath is there special focus
video just example did yep all right and
I'm going to pick up some of these cover
FX custom enhancer drops in the shade
moonlight I will go back and forth see
moonlight and sunlight typically and
sometimes I'll also mix them together
whatever entity in that day but
moonlight is the lightest one what I'll
do and I'll take that out in a dropper
and I will just put it on the back of my
hand let's just one drop is fine because
a little bit will go a long way with the
ethernet ik 8 dance beauty sponge this
one is by morphe and i'm going to just
go ahead and tap it directly on to my
hand and then I'm going to go right on
the high point of my face you can see
how intense that is it's such a great
highlight and it's going to gem over it
several times just to blend that baby
out roll back and forth and apply more
as I see needed okay now I'm going to go
amethy Kat Von D shade + light contour
palette please somehow
don't diss packaging in life this is
actually raised off potala itself it's
so cool if you were to almost like a
cardboard and now this one it's tacky so
I'm going to go animatic of these two
highlighting shade I'm going to mix them
together on my brush I'm just going to
dab that on my under eye area I'm going
to make sure to not cover up about
highlight that we put on so I'm not
going to bring this over on my cheekbone
area I'm only bringing it right
underneath the inner part of the under
eye where my concealer my foundation
always tends to move increase and break
up okay and while we're in the spirit of
setting the face I'm going to go in with
some of this mask on my X next to
nothing pressed powder action haven't
used this div just grab on a big fluffy
brush I'm going to lightly set the
bottom half of my face for this look I
don't powder my entire face and I'm not
going to go over all my contour I'm not
going to go over all my highlight kind
of proud of the bottom I face the inner
corner like on the under eye and like my
top lip area I'm going to grab some
anastacio clear brow gel I'm going to
just set my brows really quickly okay so
we're now at a really fun part I'm going
to go in with the Sela metals glitter
and glow liquid eye shadows it looks
like in this I've been reading about
these like crazy recently I believe
everyone has they're so amazing they
come out a little one like this and this
color is a really silver so I'm going to
take this one and literally just draw
this all over the lid area if you want
to make it heavier in some areas you can
like I simply like to make it the
sickest in the center of the lid that
way like when I blink you really that
intense that wow factor right in the
center and I keep it a little bit more
minimal in the inner court typically but
sometimes I've get any handed and just
do it all by I mean really there is no
wrong when applying its glitter and once
I get up towards the crease of the eye
I'll make sure I have much less product
on the wand and I'll just kind of barely
tap that glitter in the crease then
doubled it back in get that poppin and
yesterday I'm coming so beautiful are
you joking with that glitter is just so
yummy
so now there pick up some of the makeup
forever star lick powder in the shade 13
we're going to grab a small synthetic
brush this is being mapped 242 brush I
use all the time I'm going to dab it
right there just a little bit and what I
always do then goes to the lid and I
kind of rub it around the lid because it
is such fine
like the loose powder you really barely
meet any of it I'm going to use this
just to highlight my brow bone very
lightly look at that glow are you
kidding me so I'm not going to bring
this highlighter all the way down to the
glitter the glitter stops about right
here and I'm stuffing my highlight about
right here because what's going to
happen is the color of your skin is
going to come kind of a natural shadow
and look like you have on a little bit
of eyeshadow right there to kind of
carve out that crease but you don't it's
just an illusion between the glitter and
the highlights
okay so let's throw some mascara on now
I'm going to use of course the L'Oreal
voluminous in carbon molasses when I
hear masters ever going to put a thin
coat on my top lashes only because I'm
going to pop on some false ones you do
not smell false lashes for this look at
all I know I always say it but truly you
Joe on Easter I actually was exactly
with no false lashes at all I put on a
couple coats of mascara and curl my
lashes and walk out the door and my
family kept complimenting me saying how
great I look I felt naked all day though
I hate that I go sell rare because once
you get used to lashes it's like you
can't go back okay gonna pop on my
lashes out and going in it was to style
Layla by flutter lashes as you guys know
this one my favorite lashes ever because
these lashes are dramatic while still
somehow being like wispy and flurry
they're not like I don't elders perfect
I love them less are on I took a little
potty break and I feel much better okay
so not the lower lash line I'm going to
pick up some matte chroma graphic pencil
initiate NC 15 - and w20 it's basically
a flesh help flesh colored eyeliner that
was hard to say for some reason
so any flesh-colored hired if you have
let go ahead and line your lower
waterline with that the purpose of that
is just different mortgage is the eyes
will definitely make them look a little
bit more dull light and awake I don't
know what I put a bright white on there
because that'll is really 60s and a
little too like I am in your face I
wanted to keep it a little bit more
toned down then we put some mascara on
my lower lash line I'm going to go in
with the extended play gigablack lash by
Mac so now the eyes are completely done
which as you can see is so easy we have
to type a statement effect you know
which is why I've been wearing this look
so often so what you need to do when
it's so fast reflect BAM very glam now
if you want to leave your highlight like
this you totally can which I actually
really like it like this because it's
like very beautiful and fresh and subtle
but you want to go over top of it you
can as well going over top of this
highlight or any cream or liquid
highlight is just going to make it like
that much more intense and very like
in-your-face
I've got this palette in the mail
yesterday and I was so intrigued by it
the violet Vox Pro highlight palette and
I think it's so beautiful it's a very
dense and heavy and it comes with six
full-size highlights like this which it
also magnetic and removable which is so
cool it they're just so beautiful so I'm
going to pick up blue and what's this
called petal and I'm going to mix these
two together half a bunch of the excess
just so it's really light oh my gosh
it's beautiful
sorry I'm not a focus where my area that
is so beautiful
Wow a gorgeous highlight cuba's oh of
course essentially those lips even more
then I'm going to take that highlight on
that same brush I use a highlight my
brow bone I'm going to bring it down the
center
now I'm going to create a pretty
dramatic line and then I'm going to buff
that line out I don't want to keep it
looking like an exclamation point
because that's just like um hi multi
much I'm gonna pop some that highlight
just right here in the inner corner of
my eye just really lightly we highlight
is gorgeous this is the shade aquarius
by casting light and color pop and it is
the goal loss i'm going to put this on
just use a nice glossy lip
such a beautiful wat forget all the
colors so I'm not too pale and does have
too much color tomorrow sign she's such
a good job so you could do a new color
like this or you could do a bold one
like a discolor right here this is a
Nastasia in the shade tulips I love it
because it's like not a red but it's not
a pink it's like Christian gorgeous a
raspberry shade I will say though the
more I have ventured out and tried new
and different liquid lipstick brand the
less and less I'm liking this formula
which actually kind of sucks because
Anastacio has so many incredible shades
what I apply it it just gets really
goopy really easily and it's like you
can only do one swipe and if you go over
to second time it like it's super duper
crumbly I don't know but in the
applicator I'm not the biggest day of
the applicator like this is kind of like
a kind of messy application I don't know
I'm being picky oh my god my hand
surgery but yeah this color is gorgeous
I already got a guys it for this look I
hope that you enjoy if you did please
make sure to give this video a thumbs up

give me your opinion on this purple
matte paper background cuz I really want
to know what your opinion is I mean the
background does really matter to me and

of the day I want you guys to enjoy the
scenery and the composition of my videos
