so excited to have an actual entryway
this is the first time we've ever had
that this is my at home office we put
clear glass doors double doors on this
because I get very claustrophobic and I
love having like glass doors because
even when the doors are shut
I don't feel like I'm completely alone I
don't like the walls are closing in on
me
in this room is going to be all
different shades of purples and grays
because I really want my office if you
like kind of dark and that's key and
look at how big these clauses are for
storage which is like the thing that I
am so freakin excited about I can see
how humongous this is reasoner so much
storage this is our dining room which is
one of the rooms that we are the most
excited about as you can see this back
wall right here is a black tufted
lacquer
everyone thinks that it's squishy when
they come in but it's literally it's
like it's extremely hard I know
see so in a dining room what we put in
coffered ceilings because I think these
designs are so beautiful I actually
debated for them in the entire house I
thought that might be a little bit too
much so I put them in the dining room
and we are actually installing antique
mirrors in every single square and
there's going to be a chandelier hanging
in the center so for this room we wanted
to get really dark and really edgy so
it's going to be all black and gold and
silver like mixed metals I cannot wait
for this to be done this wall actually
just went in like a week and a half ago
and when I thought I lost my mind
maybe you want to leave the way sure
lead lead the way darling this is the
powder room the downstairs powder room
you know yeah you're so cute remember
yes this is the I mean I've never called
that powder room either but everyone
else has been so I'm like okay maybe I
should start calling a powder room but
this is the down Victor where you take
put a more simplistic we wanted to do
gold and whites and grays in this round
and I love marbles so much so I'm so
happy that we incorporated that into
this room all right now moving into the
main area of the house we have shimmer
stone again which shimmer stone is just
like this amazing technique I watched a
guy apply it and it's like I don't even
know how to explain it but if you can
see it's like they're surprised this
texture on the wall and when the light
comes in and shines on it in person it
literally glimmered and just shine so we
have that technique on almost all the
walls in the house and then over here
this is a breakfast area that's where
our like table where we eat our kitchen
table is going to go every single day
that we sit down to eat like our dhyryam
table will only use you know like on
special occasions or when the whole
family is over which is basically every
other day and then this right here is
our kitchen which as of now as you can
see it's torn up we painted the
cabinet's a very white white I wanted to
be a very bright white and then the
backsplash is currently coming in in two
days yeah it's going to be here on
Tuesday so my backsplash is actually
like a chevron that has like
mother-of-pearl and like a mirror in it
it's so cool and then I'm doing just
white marble so I cannot wait for that
with the Georgie he's just finding a
little nook to hang out in what's up -
which what so and shine the best part
Wow when we were younger we would always
go to Sonic and we would get like there
has very lemonade john would call it the
sonic ice and then i started calling it
the bougie ice because they're just like
those little tiny round like crunchy
pieces of ice and they're so satisfying
to chew on and i used to always tell
john like one day i'm going to have an
ice machine at our house that has sonic
ice so I surprised him and talked to the
contractor and got this ice machine put
into the house and we literally were
like screaming we were celebrating their
selfies beverages and this ice this this
is unstoppable
this is sacredness and this is my beauty
room a straight ahead of us but first to
the right we have our pool bath which is
actually not done yet this pool bath is
being redesigned this is the one thing
that was already like set and set along
when we purchased
house in November so I couldn't make any
changes to it a really really nice
bathroom which is not what I want so all
the materials that are going to be in
soon but I did get to choose on the
cabinet's being black and this right
here which I believe is it's not court I
don't know I don't know what this is
called I forgot but it's really popular
a lot of people are getting this right
now because it's not actually marble
it's more inexpensive I can't think what
it's called
then in here this is my beauty room
closet that me and my sister actually
designed together with light there we go
sorry about all this stuff in here right
now we went shopping for like new
kitchen supplies kitchen stuff
everywhere but this is my beauty room
closet that we designed specifically for
holding my makeups my backdrop my
packages all the stuff I currently have
in my beauty room right now so this over
here is where my backdrops will hang
which is so amazing because right now my
backdrops are just like scrunched up
involve on the floor just stacked in
boxes so it's going to be nice to get
them like a worthy place of hanging and
then these drawers are so nice I'm
obsessed because they're so wide and I
pull out all the way like you know how
like when you have like gorge from Ikea
they like stop and hearings like reach
back to get your makeup like these pull
out all the way and then they're like
soft clothes so you can like oh so
satisfied when you first got put in here
I stood here and did this probably like
10 minutes I just did this over and over
another closet as some of the things
that we love so much about this house is
there's so much storage because John and
I has had a lot of crap all the time
this is my beauty room this is where I'm
going to be filming so I chose this room
basically this is the perfect room in
the house for it but it has so much
amazing natural daylight which I love
those huge windows so I'm going to put
this side of the room on the right is
going to be where like my everyday stuff
is like my everyday desk with my
everyday vanity over here on the left
hand side this is going to be like
filming central so I'm going to have my
backdrop I'm going to have some hang
right here with all my studio lights and
this is going to be all the filling
arena its room right here I think might
be bigger than
our old apartment again and fear like in
the hallway we have the shimmer stone
and then it goes into like this really
really shimmery ivory wallpaper that has
like this texture and then on this back
wall
it's a wallpaper that's actually glass
be like I don't if you can see it but
can they cure it their little tiny glass
beef is so shimmery and cool-looking I
have so much phones all the details in
this house I also have shimmer so on the
ceiling and here you can see a little
bit more on that shot how it looks in
person like it just has this crazy
shimmery texture effect we had so many
ideas this room for the first couple of
months we actually landed on making it
kind of like a home theater type dealio
kind of not really so basically we're
going to have a huge TV right there and
we're going to just have a bunch of
video games movies all that jazz I lost
my mind when I saw this wallpaper it's
literally a focus for me camera
it's literally like champagne pop I
cannot wait you guys better believe that
as soon as I saw this house our first
thing I thought of was the chandelier
that I'm going to hang right there in
the stairway like I have literally been
finding the perfect chandelier for the
past what looks seven months at this
point and I think I found it it's
actually in the garage and it's being
stalled this week and also like plumbing
stuff still in that shower but I love
these floors so much I was able to pick
out these floor that once we were under
contract and I think they are so freakin
cool with all the different shades of
Gray's and whites and ivories and this
is a guest bedroom right here so much
space nice closets like they go so far
back there so deep that's what she says
okay this is the only room in the whole
house that we do not have a purpose for
which is so awesome that we're buying
this house and we have room to grow into
it because as of right now we don't have
a purpose and everyone who comes in here
is like yes you do at your baby room
this is John pride and joy so this is
his drum room which my lab sorry
everything in here is Babu soundproof
the walls have been soundproof for John
the florists observe ya the former
soundproof as well and the walls are
dark grey and a trim and the doors are
black and the ceiling they're actually
putting like this weird supercool like
textured orange wallpaper on the ceiling
because John's favorite colors are
orange and black then he has his own
closet in here Bruce John is a very very
very messy person when it comes to his
closet and so he wanted like his own
closet in his own drum room he can get
ready in now I know that I keep saying
every single room is my favorite but
this is actually where my favorites do
because I've never had a laundry room
before so that's where our washing
machine and dryer can come in cupboards
George's on apparently it's like a scene
with like new homes they have to like
tile the bottom and put a drain in case
there's a leak with the washing machine
or like catch it and prevent it from
flooding your home I always have my
washes washing machine in my dryers but
again in a little closet and you know
like how it is in apartments and condos
so I can't believe that I can actually
walk into my laundry room it's so crazy
and then for our master bedroom you guys
when I walked in here the first time I
lost my mind it is so big this is
literally his over to her over oh my god
this is double the size it's not crazy
how big this is and there's an actual
sitting area I love her I just felt how
it's funky and different it is and then
they put it molding because we're going
to hang curtains back to there and then
there's a four door bathroom is still
under construction right now because I
was making a few changes so there were
some things in here that I did not like
but I didn't have a say in them so I
changed them out so they're wrapping it
up right now so we took the tile all the
way to the ceiling right here in the
shower
be right here to see in the back are
temporary they're being replaced in
August next month was like a really cool
like ombre background we have Frankie
you want to give us a tour but this is
where we go to the bathroom
in Greece us when we walk in little
bruises it's so moody so stupid all
right so now right off of our bathroom
this is hands down I know I said about
everything but this is the most exciting
part for me because this is my closet
you guys oh my god me and my sister
worked very closely with california
closets to develop and build this entire
thing thank God for my sister this is
basically her masterpiece because she's
such a mathematician she was able to
like figure out exactly how far apart
every single shelf needed to be to hold
all of my stuff so this over here this
wall is for handbags we caught and then
clothes then shoes this maxi dress is
back in the corner and then we have this
big island right here for jewelry and
like sunglasses off the top and then all
of my clothes and stuff down there wait
for it
oh so every single like shelf in this
closet does have a light panel like a
light strip across it to make everything
light up because I want to be able to
come in here I have everything
illuminated you can see everything and
honestly better it's not necessary but I
wanted it so I doubt it I love it so
much it is so freaking beautiful like I
can't believe in an action my closet it
is so weird guys one of our spice you
are shown the back to her good time
let's go inside I think you seem very
scared
if you walk maybe not comfortable going
guys ready to see like George's run down
in Frankie's like a little nervous by it
mama boy your jewelry mmm so this is our
pool so this right here is like a
one-foot little seating area with little
fountains and then it steps off into the
actual school and then over there we
have a hot tub the grass is growing in
all kind of like funky right now they
just planted it like a month ago so it
looks kind of like sparse at first it
was like super brown guy thinks I'm
getting used to right I know it's going
to take us I'm getting this tutu bub I
love you guys so much thank you for
watching video and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
