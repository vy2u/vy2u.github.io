a really easy everyday fresh face makeup
look this is truly an everyday makeup
look this is as little as it gets for me
if I am NOT doing this and I'm not doing
anything I typically only wear makeup
about three or four days a week maybe
sometimes like one or two days a week
but three to four days a week and this
is a look that I wear when like I have
to get up early I know I'm going to be
running errands all day long I don't
want to be looking like a caveman but at
the same time I want to give a little
something so this is like my happy
medium where I'm not all dolled up and
glamorous but yeah I'm not looking like
I dead so this is super easy basic gonna
work for everybody of course I have a
couple versions of like my everyday
makeup look this is the most easy basic
shortest one that I have I do have like
an upgraded version of this that's a few
more additional products a little bit
more glamorous I of course would be
happy to do that for you if you want to
see that look as well but I thought we
would start with the basics so I hope
you enjoyed this makeup tutorial and I
will see you guys soon bye
good morning everybody
well hello honey boo boo nice to see you
shirtless haha okay moving on first
thing we're gonna do is put on our
foundation I'm using buxom show some
skin weightless foundation I'm going to
be using my very own brush line today
haha my fingertips I'm gonna just warm
this up and emulsify on the tips of my
fingers make sure your hands are freshly
clean and then I'm going to just rub
this all on my face
I know you're probably thinking what how
this froze over where's your Sigma f80
but when you're in a rush and if your
brushes are dirty hmm my situation
sometimes you just gotta use your
fingertips God made them for a reason so
as make sure you buff in the foundation
it's not going to look as pretty as a
brush but hey we can manage then I'm
using Maybelline fit me concealer this
is a drugstore concealer obviously since
it's by Maybelline it is a nice sheer
concealer but you can get a medium
coverage out of it because it is
buildable using my middle finger I'm
going to just blend this in and then I'm
also going to make sure that I get it on
my eyelid I always always do this
because you have a lot of veins in your
eyelid and if you're tired you're
definitely gonna get redness there and
it's going to show all your dirty
secrets so cover up your eyelid area it
will smooth everything out make you look
a lot more fresh I tap this a navy as
always I take it back towards my temple
make sure when you're finishing it off
you go in an inward motion from outer
corner to inner corner it'll help
prevent creasing then using bare
minerals well-rested powder this powder
is formulated to make you look
well-rested it has a brightening effect
in it but it is not a highlighter so
don't get it confused this is just going
to set your concealer and give a nice
well rested effect it's really nice for
an everyday look because it looks nice
and natural and there's no shimmer or
highlight happening it whatsoever I
always set my eye area just so that that
doesn't move around whatsoever then I'm
gonna go in with benefit give me brow
gimme brow sorry
gimme brow the tiniest little itty bitty
brush of life and is gonna go in and
just brush through my natural brow hair
I love gimme brow because it has fibers
in it that adheres to your natural brow
hair so not only does it fill in it
makes it look fuller instantly it is
such a genius product and because the
brush is so tiny it grabs onto every
single little baby hair and it is so so
fast so done with brows but I'm going to
go in with makeup geek creme brulée
eyeshadow you can use any eyeshadow you
want or bronzer whatever you prefer this
is just my go-to eyeshadow that looks
nice my skin tone and I can just put it
in my crease any day of the week and I'm
never going to be disappointed by it we
all have those go to colors and this one
is mine so using an e 40 brush by Sigma
this is definitely my go-to I brush when
it comes to blending and buffing things
out so I'm just going from inner corner
to outer corner and it's just going to
contour our eyes so we don't look like
we're sleeping then I'm going to curl my
lashes any lash curler will be just fine
as long as you like it and I get a
couple of pulses squeeze squeeze squeeze
and then I'm good to go I'm going to go
in with L'Oreal voluminous original
mascara and the shade black and make
sure that when you're applying your
mascara you really wiggle especially at
the root of your lashes it's a little
trick that we all use just like you
tease your hair for fullness you want to
tease your lashes for fullness as well
so really go back and forth and wiggle
at the root of those lashes and then
drag it down straight word if that makes
sense
then we are going to go in with Mac care
blend press powder in the shade dark
this is my go-to bronzing powder right
now and I'm using a big fat fluffy brush
and I'm going to just bronze the outer
portion of my cheeks as you can see I
shake off a lot of the excess this will
help over bronzing any streaking or
muddiness that could happen on the face
so I'm just going to bronze the cheek
area and then around the forehead just
to even out don't neglect your forehead
when bronzing because it can look a
little weird then I'm going in with
matte spring Sheena I always choose a
blush that has a really nice shimmer in
it because on days like today I'm not
going to be doing the whole highlighting
and contouring thing so using a blush
like this that already has some shimmer
in it will help to highlight in a more
subtle way and not just like BAM streaks
of highlight on the cheeks then I go
over with that well rested again
whatever is left on that brush and this
is just a trick to buff things out so
you don't have any harshness and it
looks airbrushed on the cheeks then
we're gonna go in with Mac shroom we're
gonna just dab this underneath that brow
this is one my favorite most Universal
beautiful highlight shades I've loved it
for years and I truly pretty much you
it on every one I'm going to dab it in
inner corner as well putting a light
shimmer in the inner corner and brow
will really help in making you look more
awake for someone who's more mature I
highly recommend mylar by MAC Cosmetics
it doesn't have as much shimmer but it's
beautiful
I'm gonna go in with Sigma lip gloss in
the shade tint this is my favorite lip
gloss right now for days like today
because it's pretty much the exact same
color of my lips but just nice and
glossy it's got that perfect little rose
effect to it it's going to put that on
and then we are all done could we get
any easier I think not I love you guys
thank you for watching and I'll see you
soon bye
excuse me I would wear blue no we are
not going to almost wrote it err</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
