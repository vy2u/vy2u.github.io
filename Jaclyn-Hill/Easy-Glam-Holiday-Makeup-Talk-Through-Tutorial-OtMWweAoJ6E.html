festive holiday a makeup look I have
seen a ton of requests recently for gold
glitter and red lips which I absolutely
love because it's just so Christmasy so
like and I ran to my makeup collection I
started pulling out my gold and my
glitters and I knew they came up with
this look in my mind and it was like
gold foil glitter on the lid and like a
brown cut crease maybe with some purple
smoke down underneath and an inner
corner cat eye and I was like my
creative juices were flowing at the
mad-scientist that sounds disgusting but
you catch my drift and then I was like
you know what this is so over-the-top
and so dramatic that it's not even
obtainable it's just entertainment like
it's fun for me to do and it's cool to
look at like how many people are
actually going to get inspired and
recreate this not that many because it
takes a lot of effort and a lot of
precision so I completely change courses
and I decided to do a makeup look that
it's obtainable for the average woman
maybe someone who is more of a beginner
and makeup and are not comfortable doing
over-the-top glam intense glittery
sparkly eyes from the holidays but you
still want to look festive and you still
want to look very glamorous this
Christmas as well so this makeup
tutorial is geared towards you I have
worn this look outside of my house four
times in the past couple of weeks and
each time I cannot even begin to tell
you how many compliments I have gotten
on this look from everybody just random
people walking by my waitress the host
is just so many compliments which is
crazy because this look is so simple to
achieve so since some people have
complimented it I figured it's a great
tutorial to do for you guys because it's
so easy to achieve and if you are in the
mood for it over-the-top amazing glam
makeup tutorial just type in dramatic
Christmas makeup looks and you will get
thousands of results I feel like every
day a new amazing makeup tutorial pops
up in my subscription box so many people
are putting out beautiful dramatic
makeup looks right now so they are there
are millions of them out there for you I
just wanted to do something a little bit
easier to achieve so I hope that you
guys like this video it is going to be a
top through video today meaning I'm
going to be talking to you as I'm
applying my
make up as opposed to a makeup tutorial
with a voice over so you guys at the
style this video let me know and I will
totally incorporate more voiceovers in
the future so let's jump into it so I'm
going to be starting off with my skin
today so I'm going to start by priming
my face I'm going to be using the makeup
forever skin equalizing smoothing primer
so I'm going to be putting this where I
have issues with pores because I don't
all over my face and I really don't want
this to mattify my face so I'm only
gonna put it right on the nose in this
cheek area because that's really where
the pore issue sits now for the rest of
the face I'm going to be going in with
the hourglass veil mineral primer this
is oil-free and I'm going to just be
applying this to the rest of the face
where I did not apply um the smoothing
primer right there in the center so I'm
going to put this everywhere else and
it's not necessary to use two primers
obviously you can just use one but I'm
high maintenance okay so now for
foundation I'm going to be going in with
the new L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion
I was so excited when I saw that L'Oreal
was coming out with a new formula and
the True Match Lumi because True Match
Lumi used to be like my my ride-or-die
oh my god if you guys remember from back
in the day I use that for like a year
straight I'm using the shade n 3.5 so
the system is a little different because
the original True Match Lumi I'm a w5
and this is n 3.5 so I don't know how it
works exactly but it looks like this
like a little cushion and then
foundation comes out isn't it awesome
it's so cute I'm going to go in with a
new brush by morphe I haven't tried this
yet it's brand new and this is the e 54
from the elite collection so it's a
synthetic brush and I'm literally just
going to take the brush and put it
straight in here hopefully I like this
brush oh God I'm like okay I'm waiting
to see the color bubblegum because I've
gotten so pale the past couple of days
because I've been exfoliating it all my
tans coming off and it says it's a
buildable coverage but I honestly feel
like this goes on initially as a medium
to full coverage it's really easy to
build it up see can you see how much is
going on my face like it's full coverage
I really have to like spread it around
so that I don't get cake base now we're
down foundation I'm going to go in with
concealer
and I actually just got two new Real
Techniques Beauty sponge is because mine
was getting so nasty and dingy and
fallen apart and I stopped being on
Amazon and they just got in the mail
this morning so so happy so I just went
and wet this one under the sink and it's
so firm I was like oh is this what it's
supposed to feel I have 20 forgotten
um so I'm going to be going in with a
new makeup forever concealer I don't
know these are actually out yet they
sent them to everyone on their PR list
but there wasn't any note as far as like
the launch date or anything in the bag
that it came in
so I'm using shade why three three so
I'm just gonna dot it under my eye area
like this it feels super creamy but it
doesn't feel so thick that you're like
oh this is not going to blend out like
it feels really really creamy kind of
slimy but very blendable it's super
hydrating - it's not dry which is
amazing so now I'm going to take the
damp Beauty Blender and I'm just going
to blend this out by just pouncing up
and down very quickly this is my
favorite way to blend up concealer up
all time is using any sort of damp
sponge if you're really dry on the under
eye area a tip is to take some fix+ from
Mac like this and spritz it on your damp
Beauty Blender and then blend it out and
that will make your concealer really
really hydrating but because it has
glycerin in it it'll also help it stick
to each other as well so if you suffer
and struggle with super dry under-eye
area I would suggest using some mac fix+
on your Beauty Blender okay so now I'm
going to set that and I'm going to kick
it old-school and I have to kick it
old-school and I've been doing the same
damn thing for the past year and a half
but recently I've been using the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and today I
want to use the Mac Pro emphasize powder
and the Anastacio banana powder the NS
Aussie banana powder you can buy
individually on her website and the Mac
Pro emphasize you can buy this on Mac
calm or any pro store and I'm going to
be using the morphe e 48 this is a new
brush in their lead collection I just
got these yesterday and I haven't tried
them yet so I'm just trying them now for
the first time and then I'm going to
just set that under my eye
okay so now for the face I'm going to
set it very lightly with a powder
normally I would use the lure or see a
whoa the laura mercier translucent
powder but today I don't want to be as
matte so I'm going to kick it old-school
using an e mineralized skinfinish from
Mac this is the shape medium I'm going
to be using a big fluffy brush this is
the ìiî from morphe and I'm just going
to get all up in there
and I'm just going to lightly set the
face I'm not doing this for additional
coverage the minimum eye skin finish is
very very light coverage so I'm just
doing this simply just set the
foundation in place so it doesn't run
anywhere and this will make it really
easy to blend products on the skin like
bronzer and blush and highlight but this
is not really going to give much
coverage alright so now we're going to
move on to eyes and I actually put a new
lens in my camera today so look at what
we can do we can zoom in I normally film
like a 50 millimeter lens so I can't
zoom into my eyes all the way and get
close but today got a new lens baby so
we're going to be able to finally zoom
it okay so for the eyes I'm not gonna
lie I'm challenging myself not to use
makeup geek today because I always run
to make a geek for this look especially
I use the eye shadow deserts and semi
favorite eyeshadow all time but today
I'm going to branch out and use
different brands so let me see what I
got here so I'm gonna grab some shadows
from the lorac Pro mega 2 palette I'm
going to start off with the shade right
here called tawny the third one in on
the top row I'm going to take that and
just dust it right there in the crease
you guys know this process the
transition color I'm going to not keep
this precise really at all where it's
going to blend it out in this entire
crease area and then once we don't have
a ton of products on the brush because
we already put it there in the crease
that's we're going to start working kind
of upward just to make sure it's blended
out in this entire brow bone area
anything over here just going to go in
and place that color initially right
there in the pocket of my crease if you
do not have a crease just create one
just do this wherever you want to create
a crease on your eye area if you have
hooded eyes just bring this color up a
little bit higher than your hooded
crease area if that makes sense it's
very important when you're
your eyeshadow to not only go and
windshield wiper motions but also
circular motions so I start off with
windshield wiper and then I go in tiny
little circular and I go back to
windshield wiper and then I go circular
that's really the key to getting an eye
shadow to blend is windshield wiper and
then circular it's a nice shadow color
that I really like this okay so now I'm
going to go in with wise it's not
focusing now I'm gonna go in with burlap
right here which has had a little bit
more of like a baby puke
coloring into it which you know I'm all
about that life I'm going to just layer
that right on top of tawny the original
car we went with the exact same area
just going to give it more dimension by
layering the shades windshield wiper
motions and then circular motions so I
just kind of like put it on there like
this kind of sloppy you can see it's it
really choppy and unblended and then
we'll begin to do circular motions and
windshield wiper just back and forth
between those two motions we've got
those two shadows on our eyes I'm going
to grab the Mac Pro emphasize a shaping
powder again that I use to set my under
eye area and this time I'm going to put
it on a shadow brush by my eye shadow
brush I'm gonna grab this on a Mac okay
that's attractive I'm gonna grab this on
a Mac 242 brush just any flat synthetic
eyes shadow brush will work I'm just
gonna begin to pack this on the inner
corner of the eye to make it nice and
bright this powder is just so pigmented
as you can see I love it so much
for an eye shadow I think it's so
beautiful the great thing about it is
that it's not frosty but it's not a full
matte so it doesn't look chalky it
hasn't a really beautiful natural Sheen
to it that's why it's so easy to apply
and it looks so nice I'm just packing
this on and just patting motions I'm
going to make sure to bring this up in
this area this will help open up the
eyes more if you leave it just on the
lid it'll kind of close the eyes but if
you bring it up like this towards the
bridge of the nose and towards the brow
this will open your eye up I'm also
going to take this and put it underneath
the eye area and the
inner tear duct area and make this nice
and bright right here I'm doing this
because we are going to go in and put
some glitter liner in this area so I
want this nice bright highlight to kind
of shine through and make that glitter
pop even more so that's why I'm packing
this on the inner corner here okay so
now that we are very white eyed and
bright eyed I'm going to just fill in my
brows because it's a good time to do so
I always start at the bottom of the brow
to give it the shape that I want and I
make sure to hold the pencil far down I
never hold it up here otherwise it'll
make it really dark and tense I hold it
really lightly at the very bottom like a
pencil and I just do light strokes to
give it the shape that I desire and then
I go from there I am constantly using
the spoolie I cannot live without the
spoolie I physically could not do my
brows without this now I'm going to
highlight my brow bone and I'm going to
be using what do you know something
better change I'm going to be using Mac
nylon and I'm just going to strictly put
it right at the tippy top part of the
brow bone just like a little a little
battle booyah I'm not going to drag it
around and like blend it out otherwise
it's just going to become too much too
over the top too quickly so just right
there at the high point so now I'm going
to go in with my favorite brown shadow
right now and this is by anastasiya it
is in the shade fudge so I'm going to
grab fudge on a sigma e 15 which is just
a flat definer brush I'm going to begin
to press it really tightly into my lower
lash line only strictly on the outer
corner of the eye so we're just going to
keep that like a super harsh line okay
it doesn't look good right now but it
will it's a process do not try to blend
with a small precision brush like this
one just pack it on there make it harsh
we get sharp it's not going to look good
but we will blend it out with a pencil
brush I'm going to go back in with the
same eye shadow that I used on my upper
lid I will grab
you could grab Tony or burlap or any
sort of warm brown the to use on your
lid it does not matter either one of
these will work I'm just going to grab
the burlap and just on the very tip of
the brush this is the morphe 18 pencil
brush and then I'm going to just put it
directly over that fudge eyeshadow and
just blend it in tiny little motions
back and forth and I'm kind of wiggling
my brush downward so I'm kind of going
like this as I'm going down like this
because I personally love the look of a
smoky lower lash line in the outer
corner and when it's kind of brought
down it really helps to open up the eye
because if your upper shadow is brought
up your lower shiner shadow is brought
down on the outer corner it widens the
eye and gives you a doe-eyed effect so
that's what we're doing right now is
we're opening the eye by dragging this
down and out I need you the no mirror
makeup challenge
I wonder how bad I would suck at that
because I don't look in the mirror a lot
when I'm blending my lower lashline and
I always think like I wonder how bad I
would do with that challenge I'm going
to use the map chroma graphic pencil in
the shade NC 15 / NW 20 any cream
eyeliner pencil will work I just don't
want brown shadow in this waterline I
want it to be nice in wide-eyed okay
next step is going to be applying lashes
this is totally your call though you do
not need to apply lashes for this look
you could just do mascara and totally
get away with it I'm going to apply
lashes though because it's just going to
add that extra glamour and it's very
easy to apply lashes once you practice
and get the hang of it you'll be able to
pop them on like boom this is the
l'oreal voluminous carbon black such a
good drugstore mascara so for lashes i'm
going to be going in with um the slay
lashes by flutter these were limits
traditions no longer available which
makes me so sad because they're like the
most comfortable beautiful lashes i've
ever worn in my life they're extremely
long though so i know that not everyone
is going to like the drama of these
lashes on them personally like i do
I'm just comfortable with myself and
very dramatic lashes but I know that
these are very over-the-top for a lot of
people um it's just important to find
your lash and what works for you I
always recommend the UM velour lashes
wispy
not things they are long so if you have
small eyes or really hooded eyes you
might not love them but they are so
fluffy and girly and beautiful also the
Ardell whis piece in the drugstore those
are great Vegas nay I know that she has
some lashes that are sold now at like
Walgreens and Ulta and I have not tried
them yet but I just ordered them online
but I've heard great things about those
and those are inexpensive as well so
there's so many great lash brands out
there now it's just important to find
like what style works best on you
because we all have different styles so
when I sit here and say oh my god I love
this lash so much there's gonna be
thousands thousands of people they're
gonna hate it because it's not gonna
look the same on my eyes that will on
yours we all have different eye shapes
so please flutter please Shayla bring
these back they're so good I'm just
going to pop these super duper close to
the lashline and that's why my tweezers
come in handy there are tools out there
made for this there aren't tweezers
because these could definitely poke your
eye out so I do not suggest going in
with razor sharp tweezers um go in with
an actual professional lash tool but
that's what they're so great for is you
can get them so close to your actual
lash line and not have any gaps or
spaces
I could never apply a lash without some
sort of tweezer or tool like this is my
secret to getting it so close to the
lash line this is them way on I always
start on the outer corner to make sure
that that adheres first and then I go in
with the inner corner because the inner
corner can always be a little bit
testier so I do the outer corner first
just to make sure that we're all good to
go alright so now we are going to move
on we're going to go in with some
glitter liner we are going to be using
the Urban Decay heavy metal glitter like
glitter liner this is my absolute
favorite glitter liner of all time so
all I'm going to do is line directly
over where we put that white on the
under eye area so I'm going to start on
the inner corner and I'm going to get
really so make sure that you don't do
your mask area you need to do this with
no mascara on the lower lashes and I'm
going to get SuperDuper tight to the
waterline and just begin to stroke
glitter on that area
if you have mascara on at this point
you're going to completely ruin it and
get glue all over your mascara so just
make sure you do this first I just start
on the very inner corner and then I just
drag you do not want to put on your
waterline you don't want to put it in
the inner rim you just want to put it on
the skin right and losing my voice
right underneath of the waterline on the
lash line okay so once you know that you
are totally done applying glitter that's
when you can apply mascara to your lower
lash line but I would not apply mascara
until you know for a fact that you're
done with your glitter otherwise it can
just get messy and not have that clean
look that we're going for I'm going to
be using the Volume Mascara by Kevin
Kwan my mom swears by his mascara so I'm
like let's give it a try and see what
she's hyping up about I'm trying so hard
not to make my ugly face is whatever I
apply mascara I'm like okay where is my
sculpting powder okay so I'm going to be
using Mac shade stirrer today shade Sur
is actually a permanent item at the Mac
Pro store so you can get it on Mac comm
I believe and at any pro store it comes
in a little individual pan like this
that's magnetic map shades star is my
favorite contour like all-time I think
it is such a good shade I kind of want
to try this brush for contouring but I'm
really scared of it I haven't used this
brush before but I kind of think that
this could be cool this is the morphe
e58 brush so I'm going to try this for
the first time for a contouring powder
so since I haven't use it yeah I'm going
to make it nice and dirty and rough I'm
going to get a lot of products on there
and then I'm going to dust it out this
is how I always go in with a brush for
the first time and then I'll kind of
like rub it on a paper towel beat it up
a little bit it's a process I got to
show this bitch who's boss
okay so because this brush should not
make my contour like precise and sharp I
am going to just quickly do a little
baking mm-hmm the only big thing I ever
do
sculpt up my face just bake away
so I'm just going to dust that off to
clean up the lower half of the face and
make it look much smoother more put
together for blush I'm going to go in
with this NYX blush in the shade coral
dream it just sounds like this NYX has
great blushes I love their blushes are
very pigmented and they're very
inexpensive which is just a bonus it's
going to pick that up
and just go in short stroking motions
now for highlight I'm going to be going
in with Bobbi Brown bronze &amp;amp; Glow I'm
not going in with champagne pops today
which is very hard for me because it
would actually look freaking gorgeous
with this look
but that's okay I'm going in with bronze
glow because I'm trying not to you
champagne pop so much even though it's
my baby
it drives me so crazy that my highlight
looks like that on camera because in
person it looks completely different and
person my highlight looks so smooth and
blended and then on camera it looks
chunky and glittery and creepy and like
clockwork almost every single time I
meet a subscriber you guys always tell
me that my makeup looks a better person
than it does on camera and I'm like why
I need to figure out my lighting game
but I mean I don't know I do it all on
my own like I don't have anyone that
helps me with my writing I think I need
a like hire professional just to ask
them like what I'm doing wrong because
this is not the same at all okay so now
for lips I'm going to be going in with
her red um I have warned the captain
lights Havana nights several times this
is her collaboration with Oprah
cosmetics it's her second liquid lippy
it's absolutely amazing the formula is
so beautiful it's nice and moisturizing
it's not too dry and the color is
gorgeous but today I'm going to go in
with like a true red
this is hohoho okay just whatever oh ho
ho bye
Geoffrey star so I'm going to be going
in with this one I haven't use the shape
yet so I'm really excited to see it is
liquid lipsticks they're so nice I love
the packaging they're high-quality he is
just awesome I love him
as serious it takes me such a long time
to apply liquid lipstick or line my lips
because my lips are naturally so on even
like once I go straight down and the
other side is rounded and then this side
goes straight down and then this side is
so much like fatter and has it more meat
in it my lips are so out of proportion
I've always wanted to get lip filler to
balance them out like temporary lip
filler to see if it would look better
but that kind of scares me but maybe one
day but for now that's what makeup is
for Oh last but not least I was going to
give a quick spritz of the urban decay
chill makeup setting spray to my face
and one alright so here we have the
finished look I actually just tossed a
little bit of gloss on my lips this is
the Anastasia Beverly Hills runway red
lip gloss I just thought I would put it
on so I never ever do glossy bold lips
I'm very uncomfortable with it so I
thought why not step out of my comfort
zone and try a little goals um keep in
mind that for this look you do not have
to use false lashes if you're not
comfortable false lashes if you never
use all flashes you do not need false
lashes to complete this look just
coating your own lashes with some
mascara and giving them a curl will be
more than enough the thing that really
makes this look glamorous and festive is
definitely the gold glitter liner and
the bold red lips combined so I really
hope that you guys enjoy this video and
if you did make sure you give it a big
thumbs up and subscribe you know I
appreciate it and that's it thank you so
much for watching and Merry Christmas
you guys happy holidays
Kwanzaa Hanukkah anything else is going
