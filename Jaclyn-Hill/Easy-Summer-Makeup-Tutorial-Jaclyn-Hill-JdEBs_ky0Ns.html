this beachy summery look I don't know
what the name of this is going to be yet
so that's just what I'm calling it right
now anyways this is not something I
would we're actually going to the beach
I personally don't wear any makeup when
I go to the beach um it's just going to
come off you know you're going to get
sunglass lines there's going to be wind
you're going to be getting in the water
and there's going to be sand
I just don't personally like wearing
makeup to the beach so this is something
that I would wear you know going out on
a boat or having dinner on the beach or
watching sunset on the beach or whatever
you you understand those summery things
that we do when you have a slight tan
and you just want to enhance it a little
bit and just make yourself look glowy
and fresh and whatever alright so with
that being said I know I'm going to get
questions about my hair I do in every
video I curl it with the nume wand I
don't know the name of it exactly I will
put all the links below along with a
huge discount code for that one that is
still working it will be available much
longer so if you're interested in one
grab it well Todd alright I will see my
next video I hope you enjoy bye first
thing I'm doing is applying my
foundation I'm using the Sigma f80 flat
top kabuki this is my Holy Grail
foundation brush and I'm using it to
apply the Revlon Colorstay whipped
foundation I'm using shade 330 true
beige I was 320 but I have gotten a
little bit darker so I have gone up a
shade I'm just going to buff this in be
careful since it is whipped you don't
realize how a little bit really goes a
long way so take your time massaging
this into your skin I'm going to use the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer I'm using
shade NW 25 I was using a 20 but since I
went up a shade in my foundation I'm
going to go up a shade on my concealer
as well as you can see it's not as much
of a highlighting effect as normal but I
kind of like this for the summertime it
shows a little bit more of your tan and
your glow so I'm going to just go
through my brows with a spoolie brush
because I've got a lot of concealer in
them I'm using the mineralized
skinfinish and light and I'm going to
just Pat this all over my eyes with the
Sigma highlighting brush I'm going to
use this to be a primer for the
eyeshadow so nothing creases I'm using
this Stila eyeshadow and kitten if you
guys have not heard of this shade I
recommend it to everyone it is
absolutely beautiful it is in a
word winning highlighting eyeshadow it
is beautiful in the cheekbones all over
the eyes underneath the brow is a
highlight it is so gorgeous it's just
like creamy so I'm going to rub this all
over as you can see I'm rubbing not
patting because I think that this looks
the prettiest one it is rubbed not
padded I'm using a Mac 242 brush by the
way now I'm using creme brulee I
mentioned this in my monthly favorites
video this is by makeup geek and I'm
going to take this on I don't know if
this is a Sigma or Sedona lace brush it
might be Sedona lace I'm not positive
though anyways it's just a white haired
goat brush and I'm going to just rub
this all through the crease area and
just buff this out as you can see I'm
going to keep the darkest amount of this
color and the most pigment perfectly in
that crease and then anything above or
below it just blend it out then I'm
going to use Mac rice paper as my under
the brow highlight I chose this color
because it has a little bit more yellow
in it and I think that it will
complement the rest of the face in this
glowy look that we're going to do as
opposed to a white highlight speaking of
white highlight I'm going to use
emphasize I use this all the time it's a
Mac Pro highlight and I'm just going to
dab it underneath the eyes gently I'm
not going to pack a lot on what I'm
showing you is all I am doing just to
set it so that nothing moves then I'm
using the Anastasia brow Wiz pencil this
is my obsession right now I forgot to
mention this in my favorites because
it's such a basic product but I'm using
shade soft Brown and as you can see I'm
filling in my brows much lighter than I
used to when I get to the inner part of
the eye I just barely barely touch it on
the skin I focus on the outer tail to
give more dimension in shape and then
I'm going to use the Anastasia clear
brow gel just to set everything and keep
it in place then I'm going to use a dark
brown I don't know which one this is
exactly I think it might be ground brown
on a 212 brush by Mac and I'm just going
to rub this on the base of my eyes it
doesn't look like it's gonna do much but
it's going to open up your eye I suggest
doing brown and not black because black
may be a little too harsh then I am
going to just curl my lashes
any eyelash curler you have will do and
then I'm going to use mascara this is
the YSL shocking mascara I know so fancy
but I did
Nordstrom's mascara madness last week
where you buy two get one free and I
treated myself to high-end mascaras
which I have never done before so big
deal and I'm going to use Lancome's
Hypnose mascara for the bottom lashes
because this is one of my favorite
mascaras to use on the bottom lashes
because I'm very picky about that lower
lash line and the mascara that I put on
it and then for my favorite part I'm
going to use Bobbi Brown's bronzer and
this is in golden light oh my gosh you
guys I cannot say enough good things
about this I just got it yesterday and I
cannot get enough I'm going to use this
NARS brush which is so perfect with it
this is the most amazing contour brush
I've ever used in my life if you guys
want like an in-depth contour video with
this brush I would be excited and more
than happy to do it for you it gives
such an amazing structured contour
without being too intense
it is so buildable it is just it's
lovely it is a beautiful brush I'm going
to dust that around the temple area just
to kind of bring everything together and
then I'm going to use this beautiful
blush from the tasting wait what's the
name something temptations by Mac I
forgot right for love tasting
temptations rising temperatures I don't
know and I'm going to Pat this on the
apples of my cheeks and slightly blend
back into that bronzer then I'm going to
use hard candies tiki highlighter this
is technically a bronzer I don't know
why they called it bronzer though
because it's a highlight I'm going to
use this to Dona Lee's fan brush and
just highlight the very tops of my
cheekbones just to pull this whole cheek
area together and then last but not
least we are going to finish off the
lips with Chelsea girls once again these
are all things I mentioned in my may
favorites because they're my favorite
and I can't put them down so I'm just
going to take that and rub it all over
the lips and I'm just going to dust any
light eyeshadow you have you can go back
with a kitten or rice paper or even use
Tiki whatever you please and then to set
this whole look I'm just going to give
my face a couple spritz of the Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray and you
are good to go I love you guys
I will see you soon thank you so much
for watching bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
