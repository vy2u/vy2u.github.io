doing a really fun dramatic bright
over-the-top
colorful blown out smoky makeup tutorial
I am honestly so happy because in my
August favorites I asked you guys if you
would like to see a makeup tutorial
using the shadow and it tons of you guys
said yes which made me a very excited
because I got to create something really
fun and different and just outside the
box and so okay I've here my eye so
anyways this is not the only way you can
wear a shadow of course like I did it
very dramatic you can wear a really
colorful shadow like this in many
different ways you can use as a pop of
color on that lower lash line you can
put it gently in the outer corner of
your eye you can kind of flick it up
from your eyeliner for a little purple
pop or you can wet your brush and then
go in and do liner with it that is
really really fun but you don't need it
either all or nothing I really wanted to
see the shadow in its full capacity so I
did a very dramatic and blown out purple
smokey eye which I love creating for you
so yeah I really hope that you guys
enjoy this tutorial I enjoy making it
for you so thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you soon bye hey
guys I am so ready to do this so the
first thing I'm going to do is take
smolder eye Kohl this is by Mac smolder
is a jet black putting a black color all
over the lid is going to make any eye
shadow you choose to put on later pop
like crazy which you will see in just a
few minutes but right now I'm going to
just sloppily put this all over my lid
area cute so cute and I'm going to buff
it out with an e30 2 from Sigma buffing
out on eye Kohl is actually a lot easier
than you would imagine it to be because
it is such a creamy pencil as you can
see it really has a nice gradient to it
as you're buffing it out the only thing
you want to make sure to do is not
exceed your crease area as you can see
as I'm buffing it out I'm not going
anywhere past the crease in my eyelid so
again I'm going to put that all over the
lid and I want it to be the blackest of
the black right next to the lash line
and then of course you're buffing it out
I'm just kind of fading it once you get
up towards that crease now I'm going to
be going in with a new makeup forever
artists eye shadow and if you can't tell
I'm very excited about this color it is
in the shade M - 9 to 8 don't worry I'll
link it down below for you and taking a
sigma e25 brush I'm going to buff that
and that entire
crease area so this is just the next
step we wanted to go from black to this
plum eat purple you guys can we just
talk about how beautiful this color is
right now seriously I cannot deal with
it so as you can see I am buffing this
all the way to the inner corner to the
outer corner we want it to be just as
dark and intense from inner to outer
then next I am going to go in with the
shade orchid this is by ardency in and
I'm using the exact same brush and I'm
going to just go over top of that make
up forever shadow and it's okay if it
kind of falls down on top of what we've
already done because we're going to go
in and cover a lot of this up anyways
doing all these steps is just going to
give your smoky eye a lot of dimension
and a lot of pop so when you're moving
your face and you're moving your eyes
people are going to see all different
colors shining through now we are going
to go in with the star of the show and
this is in the shade royal oh my gosh
azo Bo I am using a Mac 242 to pack this
color on my entire lower lid area all
the way from inner corner of the tear
duct all the way to outer corner I'm
going to push that all the way up in my
crease and then once I get to that
crease area I'm going to go back in with
the same brush that I used to apply that
make up forever eye shadow and just
blend those two together so that
everything is seamless it will have a
very gradient eye from a very bright
purple to a plum e2e pink if you know
what I mean and so basically you guys
laying down that smolder eyeliner in the
first place is going to make this eye
shadow pop even more if you ever want to
take a color to another level just put a
black eyeliner on before and it will
just give it a really intense extra pop
this is a very pigmented shadow no
matter what but I just honestly wanted
to have a lot of fun and just see what
we could do with it
so as you can see I am using an e25 just
buffing back and forth to make sure we
have no harsh lines then I'm going to go
in with a black eye shadow I believe
this one is Mac carbon and I am using a
makeup geek small crease brush just to I
think this is a makeup deep brush I'm
not sure I'll link this brush down below
I'm going to pack that black in the
outer corner of my eye just for a little
something extra I will say a lot of
times people can get nervous using
purples because they don't look like
they have a bruised eye and the trick to
that is using black and not gray do not
mix grey with your purple because that's
when you can start to look like you got
hit in the face caught in a dark
alleyway but like this using black it
really just gives it a little extra
smokiness so then I'm going to go in
with my favorite lashes of life at the
moment
they are by the brand flutter lashes and
this style is in the shade and the shade
in this style Camilla oh my gosh just
get ready
look at those flash this is oh my god
they're so gorgeous I honestly want to
wear them every day but they're very
dramatic so they definitely call for a
dramatic look so I'm just going to clean
up that entire under-eye area because of
course working with bright colors you're
going to have some fallout then I'm
going to go in and do my foundation I am
using giorgio armani a luminous silk and
for those of you who ask i am currently
using 6.5 as my color
I believe all us that down below to
everything is always below I'm using my
Sigma f80 kabuki brush just to buff this
into the skin if you can tell I really
press when I'm using this brush because
it makes the foundation last longer now
I'm going to be filling in my brows I'm
going to be using an Anastasia brow
powder to do so today just because I
thought I'd change it up so I am using
the shade blonde and soft Brown to do
that but that's not fun so let's move on
I'm going to be highlighting my brow
bone with Mac nylon this is such a
beautiful brow highlighter it is very
intense so make sure that you are light
handed when using it I'm going to be
using a sigma f 70 to highlight even
though it's a concealer brush it's my
favorite to highlight the brow bone and
as you will see I will bring this
highlight down a little bit and turn my
brush sideways and blend it in with that
shadow in the upper crease doing this
really helps complete the blending
process to make sure that you have no
jagged edges or harsh lines in that
shadow area and it's beautifully buffed
out it's a great secret and makeup
artistry and it makes such a difference
then I'm going to just of course conceal
hello this is necessary I am going to be
using my NARS radiant creamy concealer
and then I'm going to be buffing out
with a damp Beauty Blender I always make
sure to tell everybody make sure your
Beauty Blender is damp that is what it
is made for get it wet underneath the
sink squeeze squeeze squeeze and then
use it to apply foundation or concealer
it just moisturizes and hydrates the
skin and it makes it so that nothing
ever gets cakey and it's just fast and
easy and it just looks beautiful
so then I'm going to set that under-eye
area as always with a Nastasia banana
powder this is an absolute must for me
but you do you then I'm going to use a
flat definer brush and just pack on that
same royal eyeshadow tightly against
that lower lash line all the way from
outer corner to inner core
I'm going to make sure to take this all
the way into that tear duct because I
really want this to be dramatic and
dramatic and bring it all the way we
really make the shadow more dramatic
going back with that exact same m2m 9 to
8 eyeshadow from makeup forever and a
pencil brush I'm going to buff this back
and forth all over that lower lash line
area putting two colors like this on
that lower lash line it will just make
your eyes pop even more and just give
more dimension then using an e25 from
Sigma I'm really going to buff this down
I do not have any product on it but as
you can see I'm going to just go back
and forth over all of this under eye
area and I will circle around on the
edge of my eye to really make this look
blown out because I want this to be more
of a rounded eye than a cat eye so
that's why I'm going around the edges
then I'm going to just pop that same
nylon eyeshadow in the inner corner with
a tiny little definer brush from Mac
just for another little pop I love
highlighting the inner corner and the
brow because it really just evens out
the eye then I'm going to just mascara
my lower lashes with Rimmel lash
accelerator and now I'm going to be
bronzing I am using a makeup forever
bronzer and number 20 I'm using a NARS
eita brush to sculpt out my face I will
say number 20 and make up forever
bronzer doesn't look dark when you're
looking at it in the pan but when you
apply it to the face it's absolutely
beautiful so even if you feel like
you're kind of tan number 20 is really
beautiful on tons of people so once I
have done that I'm going to go in with
Becca flower child blush and I'm going
to be using a Mac 129 short-handled
brush to apply this all over the apples
of my cheeks and then make sure you
really blend it into that contour so
that everything is nice and buffed out
of course then I'm going to go in with
Becca rose gold this is my favorite
cheek product at the moment right now
using a sigma tapered highlighting brush
I'm going to run that all over that
blush area just to really make those
cheeks pop and glow then I'm going to go
in with a bite Beauty lip liner in the
shade nutmeg it's a really beautiful
neutral pink color and I am using this
to line the entire lip area and I will
also fill in the lip area and then once
I have the entire lips coated with
nutmeg I'm going to go over it with my
lip gloss I created with Gerard
cosmetics in the shade buttercream which
is amazing if I do say so myself and
then once you have completed that you
are completely finished with this look
so I hope that you guys enjoy this video
thank you so much for watching I love
you and I'll see you soon bye guys
I'm done like I am so done like I've
never been this done before done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
