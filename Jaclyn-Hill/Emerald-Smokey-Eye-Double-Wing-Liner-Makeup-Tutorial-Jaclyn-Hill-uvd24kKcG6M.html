this makeup look every single intros
always the exact same hey I'm gonna be
doing a makeup at or on the list that
I'm wearing right here anyways today I'm
going to finally be doing this makeup
tutorial I mentioned that was super
pumped to film my makeup tutorial like a
month ago and this was a look that was
referring to I have been so excited to
film this love because I have to be
honest I think this is the fate my
favorite look at least my favorite
smokey eye that I've ever done here on
YouTube like I love this look and the my
favorite thing about it is that it'll
good on everybody any skin color any eye
color this is in complement absolutely
everyone like it's got warmth in there
but yet like George he likes it too what
I love about this look is it has some
warmth in there but we also have like a
really fun color but the color is such
an awesome wearable color for a smoky
eye you know I'm saying like if you're
going to do a color with a smoky eye I
definitely think this is wearable and
it's just so fun and it's different so I
hope that you guys enjoy it I did add a
double winged liner to this look you do
not have to do that you don't have to do
any liner you can do a winged liner you
can do just a regular black line you
don't do anything special like ice-t--
wanted to do this because the night that
i came up with this look later that
night I was in bed and I came across old
photos of myself and when I first
started working at Mac and I used to do
the double winged liner all the time and
I would do like a stripe in-between up
like a white stripe or like a yellow
stripe in between the double wing and I
was looking at that and I was like oh my
gosh it's so cool like I haven't done
that in years so I thought I would just
incorporate it into this look to make
even more fun so I hope that you guys
enjoy this video and I stop rambling I
know I'm talking so much but that's
because I miss you haven't been here in
a while the past week has been so busy
in the next week is also insanely busy I
so many family friends business
associates all coming into town I've had
four meetings in the past week and it's
just been a lot so starting February 5th
everything is gonna finally go back to
normal and calm down a little bit but
this like two week gap is like the
busiest two weeks of my year pretty much
so I am trying to be active on Twitter
and Instagram though and they kind of
keep talking to you guys so that you
don't feel like I'm gone for too long so
yeah I love you guys
thank you so much for watching this
video and I'll talk to you guys soon bye
alright let's do this
the first thing I'm going to do today is
go in with makeup geek creme brulee and
Peach Smoothie eye shadow I'm going to
mix those two together and then apply
them in my upper crease area going all
the way back and forth from my inner
corner to my outer corner working in
circular windshield wiper motions it is
super important to lay down a light base
as a transition color in that upper
crease because it'll make everything
else that you put on later blend
seamlessly with no harsh lines I'm going
in with an e25 which is just a little
bit of a denser brush just to make that
color a little bit darker in the upper
crease area then I'm going to go in with
makeup geek cocoa bear this is one of my
favorite shadows of all time and I
realized I have not used it in quite a
while in my videos so it's about that
time again I'm going to take an e25
again and put that in the entire upper
crease now I'm going to go in with a
dark brown shade I honestly would not
recommend this particular one this is
ground Brown from Mac I will use
whatever dark brown shade you have for
yourself at home because this almost
kind of choppy and difficult to blend so
I just want to go with this one if you
got something else using a pencil brush
from makeup geek which I absolutely love
this brush I'm going to pack that on the
inner corner of my eye right by my tear
duct and I'm also going to pack it on
the outer corner of my eye as well
leaving a blank space right in between
kind of like a sandwich if you get this
all over your lid don't worry because
we're going to go in and cover a lot of
it up anyways I always make sure to go
back after every single step though and
just blend everything out because that's
really the key to no harsh lines is
continuously going back and blending now
I'm going to go in with the star of the
show and this is makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow in the shade
how de look at the beauty just take a
moment oh my gosh these shadows are so
gorgeous and I am using a Mac 242 brush
to apply this this is a flat synthetic
brush which is just like my favorite
brush ever to apply anything that's
creamy or super shimmery or glittery
because it really holds the products
very beautifully and lays it on the eyes
beautifully as well so I'm going to put
this all over the entire lid from inner
corner to outer corner and once I'm in
that crease and I it's time to blend it
into that cocoa bear that warm
reddish-brown I'm going to go back with
another blending brush and just go back
and forth take your time do this for a
few seconds I'm going windshield wiper
motions and really make sure that those
to kind of meet together beautifully and
seamlessly so you don't have harsh lines
because I completely covered up that
dark brown it's going to go back really
quickly and pack a little bit more on
the inner corner and the outer corner
you could do this with like black as
well to make it even more intense but I
wanted to do Brown because I just kind
of like that brownish bluish kind of
warm reddish-brown all together I think
they're very complementary and they just
tie together beautifully and then once
again I will go back in with the same
blending brush and just make sure that
all of that is blended out because I
always blend every single step out then
I'm going to take a q-tip and a little
bit of eye cream or any moisturizer
makeup remover whatever you have and I'm
just going to gently kind of wipe away
that excess because sometimes you can
get a little sloppy and this is a nice
little trick to kind of sharpen up that
outer corner make it look nice and edgy
so that it's not sloppy or you don't
have fallout all over the place then I'm
going to go in and do my liner I'm using
Maybelline gel liner in the shade
blackest black as always in an angled
brush today I'm only going to do a
little bit of liner on the outer corner
I'm not going to bring this liner all
the way in across the lash line because
I don't want to cover up this gorgeous
shadow that I have going on so because
of that I'm just going to do a halfway
and just kind of flick it on the very
edge and then we'll be done with that
I'm going to go in with a Mac Pro
eyeshadow and this is in the shade Kelly
I just wanted to add a little extra pop
and as you can see it's really not that
big of a difference and not really that
necessary but you know I'm having fun
I'm doing my thang and so I wanted to
add a little bit of this in the center
just for giggles this is a Mac Pro item
so you can purchase it online or Mac Pro
stores it's not available at you know
like regular counters or regular stores
now I am applying velour lashes in the
style lash in the city these have a
little wing like a flick on the end of
the false lashes which really
complements the winged liner look that
we have as you can see right here the
difference between both eyes but I did
feel like the wing on the end did kind
of slightly cover up my double winged
liner so that's just a tip for you I am
going to be priming my face with
Smashbox photo finish primer water and
oh my gosh you guys can we say obsession
this is like my new baby so I'm going to
douse myself in this primer water let it
get a little dry of course dry off the
lashes we don't need those things to be
sitting there wet on the face and then
I'm going to go in with my foundation
I'm using makeup forever
the foundation and I am in number one
two three as you can see my neck is
number one two three and my face is like
a negative zero so I am going to be
matching my neck as always I'm using a
sigma flat top f80 kabuki brush and I do
miss it with a little bit of fix+ from
Mac just because I like how it sheers
out my foundation a little bit and it
has glycerin in it so it helps just to
kind of make everything stay together
like glue for me some people can have
reactions to fix+ though if you're super
sensitive so just be on the lookout for
that so I'm going to blend this all over
the face as always nothing too special
and I know that sometimes I can look a
little yellow and this is going on but
listen I'm matching my neck and that is
what's important it will all tie
together in the end I promise I'm going
to of course conceal as always I'm using
a Mac Pro Longwear concealer my favorite
concealer of life and a damp Beauty
Blender which is my favorite way to
blend out my concealer ever so I take
this down the side of my nose and I go
up towards my temple and this very big
upside-down triangle motion and I blend
all that out and then I dab some on the
center of my nose the center of my
forehead I always put a little bit on my
chin and my upper lip on my Cupid's bow
as well just to even out that highlight
so that we do not have stuck white under
eyes and everything else is tan we want
everything to be nice and even now I'm
going to be going in and doing contour
and I am using the Chanel Soleil de tan
okay wow we're just moving on I'm using
this cream bronzer from Chanel and I am
using an F 80 again from Sigma to do
this I do prefer the f-86 which is
angled but that was dirty so we're
working with what we got right now so
I'm going to put this all over the
cheekbones and also the temples and the
top of the forehead right by my hairline
and then we're going to go in and sculpt
this out a little bit I do intend on
doing a full cream contour and highlight
video very soon it's been very highly
requested so I'm going to skip through
this pretty quickly for you guys and not
go into too much detail but I am using
the Smashbox contour Stix to do this
process that I am working with right now
and I'm using a damp Beauty blender to
blend everything out now a Hache harsh
contour like this on day to day basis
might not be so ideal and might not be
ideal for any of you but I like a really
intense striking contour when you're
working with smoky eyes and a very
dramatic look so I of course as always
I'm going to set my under eye
sealer and then I'm going to move on to
my under-eye area so I am using an
angled brush this one is by morphe and
I'm going back with that original color
from makeup geek in the shade creme
Brule and I'm going to just lightly kind
of carve out that lower double wing that
we're going to be doing I do want my
double wing to be kind of smoky so
that's why I'm starting off with a
shadow and not just immediately going in
with a black intense liner but I will go
in and continue to make it a little bit
more intense with liner but as you can
see all I'm going to do is go from that
lower lash line and just run it parallel
to that winged liner that we already
have on the top lid this when you look
at it looks like oh that's too
complicated that's too much for me but
if you really try on your own eye you'll
probably be very quickly surprised how
easy this actually is to do on yourself
so going back with a little itty bitty
TV blending brush I'm just going to
blend all that out because I do want it
to be a little bit smokier than normal
then with a little bit of concealer and
a definer brush I'm going to put that in
between those two wings so that it kind
of stands out and it's a little bit more
defined can we just talk about how crazy
it is I didn't bring that blue down on
my lower lash line I always bring the
color down my lower lash line and today
I did it and it's like what Who am I but
I really really like this I think that
it just makes it look a little bit
different than something that I would
normally wear so I am just going back
with that black gel liner and making it
more intense I did just fill in my brows
by the way I felt like it was
unnecessary to put that on camera since
I recently did an updated brow tutorial
I am going to highlight my inner corner
of my eye I'm using Mac nylon which is a
very intense highlight I absolutely love
it I use it for brow highlight cheek
bone highlight any highlight you need
nylon is a very intense shimmery yellow
based highlight and it's very beautiful
on tons of different skin tones so now
I'm going to go in and I'm going to line
my lower waterline i am using ardency in
eyeliner and the blackest color that
they have it is the creamiest of
all-time and then I'm going to go in and
cut my lower lashes with mac gigablack
mascara now I'm going to be highlighting
my cheekbones and I am using the
hourglass ambient lighting palette this
Center shade I'm not sure what it's
called right now but look at how
gorgeous this is it's like heavenly it's
so beautiful I am using a sigma tapered
highlighting brush to do this and then
over top of that I'm going to lay down
makeup
spellbound blush which is a really
beautiful kind of muted rosy pink and I
just think that it looks absolutely
gorgeous over top of this highlight it's
like it's beaming through the blush I
love it now to finish everything off I'm
going to be going and with this new Kat
Von D contour and highlight kit and
honestly you guys I am just using an
excuse to use this because I am so in
love with this kit I am using the brush
that you can buy along with it just to
kind of set all the contour that I did
earlier and sculpt out the jaw and the
chin and just make everything a little
bit more precise and cut then I'm going
to go in and finish off this look by
doing my lips and I am starting off with
the urban decay liner in the shade
native I am not over drawing my lips or
anything like that I'm just using it as
a base and then I'm going to go in with
Lime Crime coquettes which is one of my
favorite lipsticks ever it's a nice kind
of peachy pink kind of nudish shade
I love Lime Crime lipsticks because they
last such a long time on my lips
personally and then to finish everything
off I'm going to go and with my favorite
makeup setting spray and this is Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray you use
whatever you want you do you boo that
completes this look I hope that you guys
enjoy thank you so much for watching I
love you guys and I'll see you soon bye
it does not matter how what's your oh
hey oh yes you're the king of this
castle aren't you yes you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
