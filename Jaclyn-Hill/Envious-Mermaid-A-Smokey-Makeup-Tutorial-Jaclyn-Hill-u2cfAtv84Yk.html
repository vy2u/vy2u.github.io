makeup tutorial on this look that I'm
wearing right now obviously honestly I
have no idea what I'm calling this video
yet so that's why I'm just pointing at
my face but this was a very requested
video for me to do from my top make a
geek eyeshadow video that I did just a
few videos back I talked about what my
favorite eyeshadow is called Envy and so
many of you guys requested and commented
asking to see a tutorial using that
color so that's exactly what I am doing
I made this look very dramatic you do
not have to go this hardcore with your
eyes but I just wanted to do something
really fun and over-the-top because
that's just me you of course can modify
it for your own face you don't have to
do the glitter you don't have to do the
colorful liner you can take it back but
I just like doing every single step so
that you have the options and I'm
showing you how to do it if that makes
sense so also I just want to mention
that this look can be worn on any eye
color my specific eye color is actually
the least complimentary to this look
those of you who have brown eyes or dark
green or dark blue eyes this is gonna
look beautiful on you those of you who
have eyes like mine that are much
lighter and brighter this honestly is
not extremely complimentary on us but as
you can see I can still get away with it
it's just going to look even more
beautiful on those of you who have dark
eyes so just a random well fact I'm
going to include my brown eye bags so I
love you guys so much thank you for
watching and I'll see you soon bye hey
guys so the first thing I'm going to be
doing today is priming my eyes I am
doing my eye shadow first today because
we're going to be working with dark eye
shadow and it's going to have some
fallout on our cheeks and we wouldn't
want to mess up our foundation I'm going
to go in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie
eye shadow in one of my all-time
favorites and I'm going to use a sigma
e-40 blending brush and I'm going to
pack this all over that crease area from
inner corner to outer corner and I'm
going to put a generous amount of this
on you don't want to go too light in
this area since we are going to work
with darker colors the darker you make
this crease area the easier it'll be to
blend then I'm going to go in with
makeup geek dirty martini this is a
really beautiful rusty kind of dirty
shade it's gorgeous it's like a deep
army green and using an e25 from Sigma
I'm going to put this in that entire
crease area make sure you really get
that inner corner area all the way down
into that eye socket because again this
is going to help everything blend it
might not look gorgeous right now but
this is going to be very helpful
when we get further into this look then
I'm going to go in with NARS night
porter I'm going to take this eyeliner
that's kind of like a shimmery
turquoisey blue I'm going to pack this
all over that lid area but as you can
see I'm not going to take it all the way
up into that crease if you take it too
far up into the crease it can get really
messy when we go in with our eye shadow
so for now I'm just going to stop it
right below the crease and as you can
see you don't need to have a harsh line
just get it on there now we're going to
go in with the star of the show and this
is makeup geek MV eye shadow using an E
55 from Sigma I'm going to pack this on
all over the lid as you can see where we
put that eyeliner that's where the most
pigment is going to show up and this is
going to be the darkest that's okay
though you're just going to work around
that and make sure you really blend
blend blend pack that color on all over
that lid and then we're going to blend
it out as you can see right now this
look does not look cute a lot of people
at this point would be like oh and wipe
off their eyes because it really does
not look good but once you keep taking
the steps it's all of a sudden going to
come together I'm going to go back with
more dirty martini on thatI 25 brush I'm
just going to blend that out going back
and forth you can add as much dirty
martini as you need
don't take this up too far though
otherwise that's when you can start to
look like you just got hit in the eye
try to keep it low and just blend that
area out I use quite a generous amount
of dirty martini because I'm just
obsessed with everything looking buffed
and blended then I'm going in with any
makeup remover and just a cotton pad and
I'm going to clean that under-eye area
up and you will see how just doing this
quick step we'll all of a sudden be like
okay our eyes are kind of coming along
at this point because it can kind of
look like a hot mess I'm going to
highlight my brow bone I'm using Mac
shroom I believe I'm not sure what brush
this is it's technically a concealer
brush from Sigma but it's my favorite
brush to highlight highlighting your
brow bone with a smoky look like this
really helps it pull it together and
just look really glamorous and it also
helps blend then I'm going to go in with
the shade mermaid oh I love this shade
this is again by makeup geek and I'm
just going to use my fingers because I
feel like it's really easy just to slap
it on with your finger as opposed to
grabbing a brush I'm going to pack this
all over the center of that lid just for
an extra pop I absolutely love the way
it looks when you have dark in the inner
corner and outer corner and then a
really fun pop of color in the center it
brings a lot of tension to the eye area
and may
your eyes look very big and round then
this is just an extra step I'm gonna go
in with the Stila metallic emerald
eyeshadow this is such a gorgeous color
it is such a sparkly mermaid color
honestly these eyes just make me think
of a mermaid this is what I would wear
if I was a mermaid it's clearly I'm
loving the thought of being a mermaid
I'm gonna just pack this on just the
center of the lid and then only using my
fingers I'm just going to kind of blend
this out I don't want to really bring
this all the way to the inner corner or
outer corner just in the center of the
lid though and then of course I clean up
my mess I'm going to coat my lashes with
some Rimmel lash accelerator mascara any
mascara is going to do at this point
because I'm going to go in with false
lashes you can see I have a set of false
lashes on my one eye and the difference
that it makes is amazing it just adds
that extra umph and that just drama
effect I am using velour lashes and the
in the shade in the style lash a holic
these are one of my favorite lashes if
you want something that's really
dramatic now I'm going to go in and do
my face I'm going to use giorgio armani
luminous steal foundation because this
is the foundation that i know that works
for me and my skin has been upset with
me recently so I always go back to the
basics when my skin is freaking out
clearly I put this in fast motion I am
NOT that quick oh I wish I'm going to
put concealer on the under eye area I'm
using Mac Pro Longwear concealer in the
shade NW 20 and NW 25 going from the
inner corner up to the temple I'm going
to blend this out with a damp Beauty
Blender I have been loving beauty
blenders again recently for applying my
concealer it just makes the under eye
look so perfect flawless and smooth this
concealer actually is a little bit
lighter than what I would prefer so
because of that I'm going to even out by
highlighting in other areas of the face
I didn't initially want to do this but
since I have some color of my skin
recently because I self tan earlier this
weekend I did not realize how much
lighter it was going to be so I'm gonna
make myself look a little funky and I'm
going to blend this out doing this is
just going to deposit that highlight and
other areas of the face where I would
naturally have a highlight and it's
going to make that under-eye concealer
look a little less intense if you ever
go overboard on your under-eye concealer
just even out that highlight on other
places of your face and it won't look
stark white or crazy I'm going to set
the under-eye concealer as always using
the banana shade from the Anastacio
contour kit I have to set my under eye
concealer otherwise it just melts off my
face not everyone has
- but I personally do it's a must I'm
going to do my brows and bada-bing
moving on
haha the power of editing then I'm going
to go in and contour my face I'm using
Mac care blend press powder in the shade
dark and I'm using a makeup geek brush
I'm not sure what this brush is called I
absolutely love it though I will link
this brush down below for you I promise
so I'm going to contour the cheeks with
that once I make that line I go upward
never bring your contour downward
otherwise it'll have the opposite effect
I always even it out by touching it on
the forehead and temple area just to
make it look like a little bit of a
sunkissed glow then I'm going to go in
with Kat Von D blush in the shade excess
and I am also sx-- a sex I don't know
how to pronounce that right and I feel
like I'm about to say some dirty words
so I'm gonna leave that one down below
along with everything else I'm just
applying that to the apples of the
cheeks and working backward then going
in with my Holy Grail this is opal from
Becca and I'm going to highlight the
cheekbones with a sigma tapered
highlighter brush just going to
highlight the cheekbones and then also
my Cupid's bow as well putting a little
bit highlight on the Cupid's bow will
bring more attention to the mouth area
and just give that really pretty
shimmery effect now I'm going to move on
to my under-eye area using a flat
definer brush I'm going to take the
shade Envy that we start off with and
buff that from outer corner all the way
to that inner corner a lot of times I
don't go all the way to the inner corner
but I am today because I want it to be
ultra smoky down there I'm gonna buff it
out on a pencil brush and some more
dirty martini I just love the eye shadow
names in this dirty martini mermaid MV
like yes give it to me so after I have
buff that out I'm going to go back in
with some more mermaid just in the
center for a little bit of a pop that
way it matches that Center pop of blue
that we have on the top lid as well
it'll just even it out and then I'm
going to go in with NARS Baro streets
yes
Baro Street is the name of this such a
random name I feel like I can't get it
out right but Baro streets is the name
and I'm going to line that lower rim as
you can see it really opens up that eye
and just gives a little bit more of a
dramatic intense effect it just brings
more attention to the eye area this of
course you don't have to do or you could
put black down there but I just wanted
to have some fun
I don't do looks like this a lot so I
thought let's do it big or not do it at
all I'm going to coat the lower lashes
in Ramola
accelerator this is my favorite
drugstore mascara for lower lashes it
really separates and lengthens and
doesn't make them too chunky which I
cannot stand my lashes being super
chunky then I'm going to go in with bite
Saira Saira I want to say Sarah Saira is
the name of this lip color I'll link it
down below and I'm going to top that off
of some mac underage lip gloss because I
wanted to have a little bit of a coral
but I don't want it to be too bright
since the eyes are definitely speaking
for themselves once you've done that you
are completely done I hope you guys
enjoy thank you so much for watching
I'll see you soon bye
I mean ow looks like a halo Oh could be
better yeah it really does I like if I
put my arms behind me and they look like
