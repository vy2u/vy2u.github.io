drugstore makeup tutorial this has been
highly requested for quite some time and
so I wanted to do a tutorial that really
everybody can wear this is definitely an
everyday look daytime appropriate you
can wear this to lunch you can wear this
to work you can wear this running
errands and it's very easy to take like
to the next level for a nighttime look
you can just put on some liner smoke it
out and you're good to go
this is not going to single out any skin
tone or any eye color everybody can wear
this no matter how pale no matter how
dark you're all good with this look so
other than to products which are just
like my Holy Grail products they don't
count this is all drugstore so I really
hope that you guys enjoy this video
thank you so much for watching and I'll
talk to you soon bye hey guys so first
thing I'm going to be doing is probably
my face and I'm using the Loreal magic
lumi face primer I am doing this
specifically because I am dry and I want
that extra glow then I'm going to go in
with the L'Oreal True Match Lumi
foundation on top to enhance that glow
even more but if you are oily I would
suggest going in with the original
L'Oreal True Match because it's much
more of a matte to natural finish you
can look a little bit like a greased
chicken if you use the primer and the
lumi if you are oily but for me it's
amazing because i am dry so I'm using an
F 80 kabuki brush by Sigma as always and
I'm just going to press this into my
skin whatever brush you're using or
Beauty Blender I suggest pressing first
and then you can rub but always press it
first it'll help your pores except the
foundation better and last longer these
are my two favorite concealers they are
both by Maybelline one is the fit me
concealer and one is the age rewind the
Maybelline fit me concealer is honestly
my favorite but today I'm going to go
with the aid rewind and the reason is
because this dries to more of a powdery
matte watch where the Maybelline fit me
is a little bit more dewy they both last
the same amount of time on me they both
have the same power as far as creasing
on me but this one is just a little bit
more matte and powdery so I am going in
with the second to lightest shade I
don't know the name of it is all that
below of course though blending it out
with my Sigma F 86 brush and making sure
that I go over the lid as always because
that will help prime for my shadow
because I haven't found an eyeshadow
primer that I love from the drugstore
not the highlight I'm going to dab this
on my chin corner of my lips and then I
will also do it right in the center of
my forehead this will just make
everything look much more even and it'll
make sure that the under eye highlight
doesn't look too powerful and
overwhelming because sometimes
especially if you use a flash that under
highlight can look way too overwhelming
if you don't even out across the face
then I'm going to go in with a non
drugstore item which is my Anastasia
brow is in the shade ash blonde and
caramel I believe I will link my brow
tutorial down below if you want to see
in depth but I'm just gonna cut it off
looking like a mad Oh
rawr okay and then the second non
drugstore product is my Mac Pro
emphasize I'm going to set this whole
area so that nothing creases on me again
I cannot find a part from the drugstore
to do this job if you guys have one that
you absolutely love pleasing it comment
down below with recommendations because
I'm totally open to that I'm just
setting everything and padding I'm not
using too much powder just a sheer
amount and then when I look in the
camera I was like whoa that looks
intense in person it did not look that
bright then I'm going to go in with
Maybelline chai latte this is a set of
four shadows and I'm going in with that
medium brown it's difficult to find a
good matte shade that is a light brown
to really help blend at the drugstore
but this one is really nice and it's a
really beautiful mid-tone Brown it's not
too warm or too cool so using a sigma
e40 brush I am just going to blend this
on the crease then I'm gonna go in with
L'Oreal amber rush look at how pretty
that is on my finger I'm going to Pat
this with my little finger all over my
lid because I find this shadow just
works much better when you apply it with
your finger as opposed to a brush which
boom extra money saver right there so
I'm just going to Pat this all over the
lid from inner corner to outer corner
and just push it all the way up into
that crease it's such a beautiful
metallic shadow that you really don't
have to do much work just rub it all
over your skin and it's going to look
pretty then I'm going in and blending
that out and using just a little bit
more of that brown color from the chai
latte then I'm going in with that light
white frosty shade from the Maybelline
chai latte quad and I'm just going to
highlight under my brow and then I'm
going to go in with this dark purpley
brown color at the very bottom and I'm
going to just push Satz in
at lower lashline with any definer brush
that you have you can also use a q-tip
for this part that works just the same
and then we are going to go over it with
L'Oreal and brush again any pencil brush
and blend back and forth from inner to
outer corner I typically don't do
shimmer on the lower lash line but this
looks really pretty especially since
it's the same shimmer that's on the lid
it's very complementary then was going
to curl my lashes the Revlon color red
line curler from the drugstore has
always been a good one and then just
going in with the L'Oreal voluminous
mascara this is the original I have gone
back and forth between this one in the
carbon black but I have to be honest the
carbon black L'Oreal mascara is a little
too chunky for me this one helps
separate my lashes while lengthening and
volumizing them so I love it going with
a lot of mascara because I want my
lashes to stand out since we're not
doing falsies or liner then we're going
in with the NYC sunny bronzer and I'm
using a new brush to contour today boom
boom boom and I don't even know the name
of it so I will put that in hide down
bar below this video as well it is from
Sigma but I don't know the name but I
thought it's time to switch it up I've
been using the NARS eater brush for so
long let's try something else and so far
I've been loving this brush now we're
going in with hard candy Tiki
highlighter and I'm just going to use a
sigma tapered highlighting brush and put
this all over the cheekbone area I'm
doing this before blush because it will
help to look for like more like you're
glowing from within it's just a little
trick to do it first and I'm taking it
and putting it underneath my brow a
little bit more because that first
highlight just wasn't enough for me and
I wanted to put a little bit more
shimmer and then I will also just dot
that baby on the inner corner of my eyes
to open the eye up even more then I'm
going to go in with the NYX coral dream
blush this is a matte shade so that T
key that we put on underneath that
highlight will really shine through this
matte blush and I'm using a makeup geek
brush to apply this this brush is great
for blush wow that's too many brush
blush I'm confused already I'm going in
with Maybelline blushing beige this is
from that new line and then I'm going to
tuck up with NYX butter gloss and creme
brulee and you are all finished I hope
you enjoy I love you guys I'll see you
soon
I just have to get something off my
chest really quickly this is super
random I know um and very unlike me but
I just have to talk about I tried very
hard to read pretty much all the
comments that you guys leave me all over
social media and here on YouTube I take
at least an hour out of my day every
single day unless it's a day where I'm
like with my family all day and I read
through comments that you guys are
leaving me and I respond to tons of
comments but more than anything I read
through comments cuz I want to stay
connected with you guys I want to know
what you're thinking I want to know what
you think about the videos and the stuff
that I'm putting out there and so on and
so forth and as my subscribers have
gotten bigger and start building in
numbers I have started to get comments
that have just been I don't know how to
put it beyond false and hurtful I can
deal with the typical haters I can deal
people telling me I'm ugly you're this
you're that whatever like it's fine I
can deal with that it's not a big deal
but I cannot deal with people accusing
me of being someone that I'm not to the
core
Who I am as a person in my heart telling
me that I'm stuck up or I'm conceited or
I look down on drugstore makeup I look
down on people who were who used
drugstore makeup and the reason that I
use high-end makeup is because I don't
care about my subscribers and I don't
care about them being able to afford
makeup and not afford makeup hmm could
not be more off about Who I am as a
person the people within those comments
obviously don't know anything about me
and I actually feel like the majority of
you guys do get me the majority of you
guys do know my heart is slays that
sounds even though we've never met in
person because when I'm walking through
the mall and someone comes up to me and
is like Jaclyn oh my gosh you're on
YouTube and they tell me how they feel
like they know me already I literally
feel that connection with you guys too
and the ones who leave me comments on
the daily and weekly basis I see their
little icons and I recognize your names
I recognize your pictures and I feel
like we're actually friends as silly as
that sounds I do like I think this all
comes from being homeschool like I
needed more friends I just want to say
that here it looks like I have it all I
get it I see myself on YouTube on social
media and it's like I look like my life
is soaked
amorous and I'm all about hair and
makeup and fashion and oh my goodness
and no no no no no no no no no I have a
real life too I'm a real person I have
my struggles I have my my drama and the
things I cry about the things that hurt
my heart I have issues too I'm a real
person just like you it's just I don't
choose to bring those things on camera
like I'm doing right now like a total
hypocrite I don't choose to bring those
things on camera and talk about them
because I rather smile than be sad and
laugh over cry I'm just that's just my
mentality and I think that you guys get
the wrong impression sometimes because I
just sit here talking about all these
superficial things but this is supposed
to be a channel where we can escape from
reality this is supposed to be a place
to come to get away from your bosses to
get away from 5 o'clock traffic to get
away from your bills to get away from
the bad relationships and the bad things
going on your life that you can't
control this is supposed to be a place
where us girls can come as a community
and empower each other and have fun
together and talk about silly things and
talk about makeup and overpriced
eyeshadow like that's what this channel
is about to have fun to do things to
make you feel girly and feel like people
can relate with you that's what I'm
about here and for those of you who are
reading my silliness and the way I come
across as being conceited like that was
never my intention that's not who I am
that's the last last last thing I ever
want to be thought of is conceited or
fake or anything like that because it's
literally the complete opposite Oh Who I
am that's not me and like I'm just
saying I I get it for those of you who
can't afford nice makeup I get it like I
could seriously cry this is very
dramatic but I'm serious John and I got
married when I was 19 years old like
literally just her 19 a couple weeks
before I walked down the aisle
and I married him for one reason and one
reason only and that's because we were
so madly deeply in love and we married
for the right reasons but love does not
pay the bills and so we didn't know how
we were gonna pay bills it was very
difficult and for years we struggled and
everybody knew that we were struggling
it was very obvious and it was very
difficult I could not afford and I did
not buy any makeup like and the struggle
was be
on real like I get it like I understand
what it's like to not be able to afford
makeup like I remember looking at this
benefit highlighter Watts up I think it
was called when it came out and I was
just like oh my gosh like what would it
be like to be able to afford that like
oh my god I can't imagine and I still
don't own it like I just want a specific
item just being like oh my god like I
can't imagine like these girls are so
lucky to get to have this highlighter it
looks so beautiful like it's just I'm
just saying like my life is not what it
comes across on camera and I want you
guys to know that I'm much more real
than a lot of you are imagining me to be
I'm a real person like I have skin and
it hurts when I get burnt and I'm just a
real person and I'm sorry for those of
you if I made you uncomfortable and
you're still watching but I just wanted
to get this off my chest so I love you
guys for those of you who understand me
for those of you who support me for
those of you who are continuing to share
my videos like my videos comment my
videos and helping me get more
subscribers and reach goals you guys are
just you guys are everything and beyond
so thank you so much for watching thank
you so much for listening I hope you can
appreciate the rawness and the realness
and from now on I'm not going to be like
this I'm gonna go back to being happy
Jacqueline I just had to get this off my
chest so that I could go on with a smile
on my face so I love you guys so much
thank you for watching and I'll see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
