is going to be SuperDuper random at
least it's SuperDuper random from me but
I'm excited because I love filming
random videos I was planning on filming
a totally different video today um but
that's gonna get pushed back a couple of
days because now this one is taking its
place because I cannot believe how many
requests I have for the look that I'm
about to do for you last night on
snapchat I just quickly snapped myself
laying on the couch awful so good to lay
on the couch and eat popcorn but anywho
I snapped saying I felt like I was naked
because I wasn't wearing false lashes
cuz I just had like mascara on my
regular normal god-given lashes god
forbid and whenever I wear my makeup
like that I always like kind of feel
like oh my god do I look okay like do
people notice I feel like I'm like I'm
sorry I'm not wearing falsies like it's
ridiculous this is why if you don't wear
false lashes don't start only wear them
like a couple times a year on a special
occasion don't start doing it every day
because it'll become like me and you
become high maintenance for no flippin
reason and it's not necessary so for
today's video I'm going to do the look
that I haven't snapchat last night that
was so highly requested from you guys
it's crazy because I don't know if I've
ever had that many screen shots in my
life on snapchat even my friends and
family were texting it was screenshot
like please to a makeup tutorial but are
you kidding it's so easy so it is going
to be a full coverage look but it's
gonna be fresh it's gonna be dewy it's a
little very hydrated very girly and we
are not going to be using false lashes
but we're still gonna bring attention to
the eyes so let's get started I feel
like I have like cleavage galore and
girl that's not my style so don't judge
me so I got to whisper at you guys okay
my hair is back so now we can do our
face without any disruptions alright I
am going to start off this look by
priming my skin today I'm going to be
using the Becca backlight priming filter
I love this it has like a really
beautiful Sheen to it it kind of frost
the innocence so if you are oily and you
don't want to add any like additional um
like shine to your face I would try to
stay away from this one but if you are
looking for that oh my gosh
my favorite one and if you're looking
for a more inexpensive dupe the Loreal
one from the drugstore is Bob then I'm
going to take the make up forevers step
one primer and this is the smoothing one
they have a huge line with all different
options all different primers but I'm
going to use the smoothing one today
just because currently I am having some
texture issues right around my nose area
and so I'm just going to take this and
I'm going to rub it right on that
section to kind of blur out those pores
and that texture that I have this is not
necessary right now you don't even need
to use a primer if you don't want I
personally just start using primers like
the past year and a half maybe two years
I never used it in the past I never
needed it um but this one right here is
very similar to like a benefit
Porefessional dr. brandt pores no more
it's not going to eliminate any acne or
any pores that will kind of fill them in
and blur them out now for foundation I'm
going to go in with the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD stick foundation this is my
number one foundation at the moment I
will say I tried the YSL Touche Claw
radiance awakening foundation um two
days ago my first impression of it was
really bad you guys it kind of sucks um
but I'm gonna keep trying it might be
because my skin was so dry that day so I
will try it again to see if my opinion
changes because girl Ray's been too much
money on a foundation you force yourself
to like it I'm going to put two stripes
on the cheeks one here now I have been
using the artiste brush a lot recently
for foundation which is this right here
but today I'm going to switch it up and
go back with one of my other favorites
because I feel like this is the only
brush I've used like the past five or
six weeks and I kind of miss using Sulur
ones so this is the morphe m-43 9 and
when you are using a regular foundation
brush like this you actually need more
foundation if I was using the artiste
oval brush I would only put one stripe
on my cheek because less is more with
that brush but since this is a regular
one we're going to do two stripes and
then I am going to just buff this out
you know the drill here
it's so for concealer I'm going to go in
with Urban Decay Naked skin concealer
I'm using shade medium light neutral and
I'm going to just paint this on the
under eye area I really don't have
a rhyme or reason and doing this I just
kind of slop it on there I have so much
texture right here right now and I don't
know what is causing it but it's been
there for like a month I'm like I'm high
when I blend out my concealer I make
sure that my Beauty Blender is very damp
not just a little damp but I make sure
that it is like I put it under the
faucet and I squeeze it probably 20 to
25 times that way it's like as big as it
possibly can get and then I wring it out
and either a paper towel or just a clean
hand towel and I just squeeze like twice
and then that's it I want it to be
really really damp because I wanted to
give my skin like that extra hydration
also the more damp your Beauty Blender
is the more it will help you avoid
having under I like cakiness because the
moisture will help soak up the
additional the excess product so that
you don't get cakey another tip that I
learned from a MacPro artist when I was
getting my certification was that when
you're tapping out your under eye
concealer to never just go one way if
you just do this it'll give it more of
an opportunity to settle your fine lines
but if you want to go back and forth and
kind of pounce like this it'll kind of
confuse the concealer should not sit in
one place and you're rubbing it in the
same motion so going back and forth in a
patting motion will really help it not
to settle into fine lines and I when I
first heard him say that I was like okay
but I actually think it works okay so
now I'm going to take the Kat Von D
shade light palette and I'm going to
grab this beauty vole banana shade right
there in the center this is one of my
favorite highlight powders for under the
eyes of all time my absolutely love the
anastasi banana one but I don't have
that with me right now I hit pan on it
so hard as it up against the edges and
I'm like scraping it out I come to mama
so I'm gonna use this one I'm gonna zoom
you guys in a little bit so you can O
see any more using you know oh alright
I'm going to just tap this all
underneath the eye
oh girl that is alight okay it's okay
it's okay don't worry guys we're going
to make it work
always set my eyelid no matter what look
I am doing because if I don't set my
eyelid all this concealer and everything
will get really crazy
taking that same powder I'm going to
just put it on my chin all right here
and then I'm also going to let me grab
different brush for this and I'm also
going to take it and put on the center
of my forehead these are just tricks to
balancing out the highlight on the face
so that you don't just have a stark
white or yellow under-eye highlight
doing this will kind of help balance
everything out and then once we bronzed
it'll tie everything together and make
it forever two five one broader t5i
bronzer this is the compact waterproof
ultra natural bronzer right here my
favorite bronzer I think this I mean
that Cassie's my favorite out of all the
browsers and cosmetics but it's one of
my absolute favorites I love the texture
I think it looks super natural on the
skin so I'm going to pick this up I am
using the tum 4:05 brush I don't wanna
talk about you guys this brush is
ridiculous it is so so over the top and
it is so ridiculously expensive like
it's shameful but honestly you guys it
is my favorite bronzer brush of all time
I try to talk about too often because
it's like one of those things it's like
you can live without it but once you
have it you're just like my baby and
then when you get a stain on it you'll
cry yourself to sleep because you'll be
like this cost more than my home I'm
just going to bronze right at the
hairline like literally on the hairline
and I'm going to bring it down cut up to
the tail of the eyebrow like this and
then when it gets to the center the
forehead I want to leave this blank
because I want that to stay nice and
light right there and then only at the
hairline in the center and then over
here bring it kind of down wrap it
around the eye towards the corner of the
mouth but not all the way to the corner
of the mouth and now for brows I'm going
to go in with the Anastasia brow definer
and I'm going to only fill in over here
my nose I can't see it you can feel it
ah I got it and what I'm going to do
since we are doing a more quick natural
look today
not going to fill in the brows like I
normally do I'm only going to fill in
specific area that are bald and just
need the help so on this brow it is
always right here for me and I'm going
to go really light handed it's hard to
talk when I'm doing this and go in and I
will just lightly fill in the tail this
is the brow that is always a pain we all
have that one brow this is my brow it
drives me crazy if I can't you just be
like your brother right here I have a
little bald spot so I'll just okay now
I'm just going to set my brows with
clear brow gel this is by anastasiya as
well I'm telling you this clear brow gel
is literally superglue I'll never forget
the first time I tried this I was like I
am NOT going to buy this this is not
worth the money it's a clear brow gel
that is ridiculous my friend was like
just wait this is literally superglue in
a tube it's perfection it's the best
brow gel of the world and all that fine
and now here we are 27 bottles later and
I am completely addicted for eyeshadow
I'm going to do literally like the most
natural thing in the world I'm going to
grab the morphe 35o palette and I'm
going to take the center shade right
here that is barely a difference from my
own skin tone because I just want
something so subtle like a natural
shadow and this is so quick and easy and
I'm going to grab any fluffy brush that
you have and I'm just going to lightly
dust this in the crease of my eye really
only on the outer corner this isn't even
necessary you can just go with
absolutely no eyeshadow and be
completely fine I'm just doing this to
be you know ridiculous as always I just
realized I didn't bring my Mac nylon
over here
what am I going to highlight my inner
corners with trying to find something to
highlight with it's going to be
comparable to Mack nylon because my Mac
night wait a second I'm gonna take a
tiny little precision brush this is the
morphe 35n our corner brush boom you can
put as much or as little of this on as
you please I prefer a lot mMmmm
are you surprised I'm also going to put
that on my brow bone as well just right
underneath this is not the brush that I
like to use for this to use a flat
synthetic brush but I don't have one
with me like a Mac 242 I just discovered
one by morphe yesterday that I really
found love with as well but this brush
will do the trick
so the eye liner I would like to use is
the ardency in one this is my favorite
eye pull of all time as you can see it's
like completely destroyed on the top I
do not have a pencil sharpener with me
so I can't sharpen and use that one so
I'm going to use the makeup geek full
spectrum eyeliner pencil I haven't used
these yet I have no idea how it's going
to perform but we shall find out so
first thing I'm gonna do is just line my
waterline
and then same with the top I'm just
going to really focus on that outer
corner on the top of the eye right there
okay now what I'm going to do is just
grab any angle brush this is technically
a brow brush by anastasiya um it has
like a spoolie on this end but it works
great and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take it and I'm going to put
like the product on the pet like on the
brow brush itself and then what I will
do is just strictly on the outer corner
I am going to kind of buff that liner
out and as you can see it's not intense
there's not like a ton of product on the
brush that's making this really dramatic
or anything but I'm just kind of buffing
this out a little bit so that it'll be
just kind of like a little smokey only
on the outer edge and now I'm just going
to do the exact same thing down here as
well kind of smoke it out the purpose
behind this is it's going to make your
eyes with a little bit bigger because
when you do line your waterline and you
just walk away it will tend to close
your eyes and they can make your eyes
look small and kind of beady
um and if you have very large eyes and
that's not going to be like a worry to
you but for someone like me where I have
like during medium-size eyes um it can
make my eyes look really really tiny and
squinty so doing this step will open the
eyes back up I'm going to curl my lashes
really quick I am using a Kevin a Quan
eyelash curler just going to give it
like a quick little squeeze I don't want
my lashes to be too insanely perked up
now I'm going to be using better than
sex mascara this is by two-faced right
yes two-faced - or foo face if you guys
know where that's from
then you're my people this mascara as
you can see when you initially apply it
it like mix your lashes I don't want to
use the word chunky but it does it makes
your lashes kind of chunky really
intense right off the bat um so I like
to really make sure that I wipe my brush
off like I like to kind of
this on a paper towel to get off excess
products because I don't like it when my
lashes look SuperDuper chunky like that
um but I do love this mascara in general
so after I rub off a bunch of the
product I like the way it looks better
on myself
do you see how freaking messy I am this
is not even funny
like I cannot even control this one I'm
so messy but the good news is is that
when this mascara dries in like 30
seconds all I have to do is just grab a
q-tip or a brush and it'll just come
right off like I'm not trying to not be
messy because I know it's so easy to
clean up it will say I like the ardency
in eyeliner better than the makeup geek
one that I just tried the ardency Inn is
a little bit blacker and I feel like it
stays in place like I can see the mega
peak one is already kind of so lightly
starting to leave my waterline so I will
say that the ardency in still my
favorite eyeliner okay so now for blush
I'm going to go in with this broken one
right here which is Mac Melba I need to
replace that I'm going to go in with Mac
Melba and I'm going to mix it with a
little bit of Mac margin these are like
my one of my two favorite this entire
palette is actually my favorite Mac
blushes but these two are I think my two
top one so Melba and margin they go
pretty strong in the blush today because
I really want to have intense like rosy
girly cheeks
a really great dupe for the color
combination I'm using right now for
blush would be Milani Luminoso which is
from the drugstore
it is such a beautiful shade I went
through an entire compact a couple years
ago I love it so much and it's super
similar to this so now for highlight I
know tons of people were wondering what
highlight I was wearing on snapchat last
night I mixed champagne pop with
Anastacio crushed pearl which is this
shade right there and as you can see
crushed pearl is like an icy pink and
champagne pop is very champagne gold so
those two together are going to create a
very unique color of highlight I don't
want to use crushed pearl on its own
because it is just so pinky and so I see
um but I want to mix it with this
because it's kind of like the perfect
combination I'm literally going to go
back and forth between the two and get
like a perfect combo of both shades I'm
going to grab a fan brush this is more
feet m31
oh and I'm going to just hit that oh god
I hate the way my highlights on camera
it makes my skin look like it has so
much texture it does not look like that
in person it drives me crazy okay so
we're gonna just blend out this zebra
stripe I'm going to bring it up on the
side but let's Hill the brow kind of
thin it down then what I'll do is go
back in with the blush brush really
quick quark and just run over the base
of the highlight so that we don't have a
zebra stripe of highlight running to
through our face and it kind of blends
in with the blush instead of being like
you know I'm syan you're not then
I'm going to go back in with the morphe
35o palette and it's going to grab this
shade right here I'm just going to put
it underneath my lip to help it look a
little bit powdery and fuller okay so
now I'm going to take some touch-up
luminous dewy skin mist
I'm going to set my face right I'm going
to cover up my eyes because this will
make my mascara and eyeliner transfer
because it does have oil in it so I'm
just going to cover that up and then
spray my cheeks for lips I'm going to be
using a Xenu a bite Beauty a lipstick
this is the amuse-bouche a lipstick in
the shade honey comb it's this really
pretty nudie shade nudie shade I'm gonna
go in with Marc Jacobs lip gloss in the
shade pretty thing pretty much the exact
same color as the lipstick are you guys
that completes in this makeup tutorial I
hope you enjoy keep in mind that I am
really into highlighted and dewy skin
and I know that's why so many people
requested this look because they were
loving all the highlight on snapchat but
you can still achieve this if you want
an all matte look as well just follow
the steps and leave out the highlighting
steps that I take just make this your
own make my looks your own your own say
whatever I do make it work for you you
might be really crazy oily and I'm crazy
dry so do whatever works for you I just
want to give you guys a good general
outline and help inspire you but I want
you to do you so anyway that is it for
this video all I can say is I'm praying
that my highlight is coming across on
camera because sometimes it doesn't and
when I look in the mirror right now it
is literally the hallelujah chorus being
performed by baby angels on my cheekbone
but when I look into that viewfinder
that viewfinder scares the crap out of
me because it looks like a zebra stripe
cover and oil and texture not cute that
defender is trying me right now I'm not
even gonna look at anyways thank you so
much for watching this video you guys
thanks for spending the afternoon with
and thank you for requesting this video
so yeah that's it I love you guys and
I'll see you soon yeah bye hello darling
please super drew but a little route
lean very dehydrated looking I'm so
awkward
