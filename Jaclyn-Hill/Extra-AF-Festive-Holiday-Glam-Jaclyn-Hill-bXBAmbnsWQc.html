today's video I'm going to be doing a
makeup tutorial on this look let's just
see all right here I don't know what I'm
naming this video but this is definitely
like my version of Christmas the lamb
like I just wanted to do something so
holiday and Christmassy and festive I do
not decorate my home with like reds and
greens at that typical beautiful holiday
look everything in my house is like
golds and Silver's and whites like a
very white Christmasy so I wanted to
bring to life that festive classic
traditional holiday glam but with my own
extra as twist in today's video I also
tried out the new Kylie cosmetics
concealers and her brushes um so I'm
gonna stop babbling I hope you guys
enjoy this and makeup tutorial it kind
of I could get right with me Gareth me
in control I don't know the difference
anymore at this point honestly but I
love you guys thank you for watching and
I hope you enjoy hey guys I want to talk
to you like this right now
yeah this blemish right here I have to
say blemish because just makes me so
much girl here it's a blemish um it
actually playing me so hard right now
and it looks like a wart so oh a
lot of Christmas it's just such a holly
jolly type that's crooked sharing that
bitch
straighten cards nothing bear see me
shove into it because I am not in the
mood to deal with this right now so just
go ahead and cover that little bitch I'm
gonna pry in my face right now oh my god
and I'm using them for a new bottle of
this primer there's something about the
first pump of a primer that you're just
like oh these hoops have got to go for a
minute because those are gonna get
annoying real quick so let's just let's
just get in there and start beating thy
face shall we recently I have been using
the hourglass and vanished stick
foundation and I just like do stripes on
my face this is in my current foundation
routine and honey you know mama likes
that full coverage look so let me just
I'm gonna grab my Dior forever the best
foundation in the entire world I'm gonna
do a couple pumps of that in the back of
my hand I'm gonna take out these
these bracelets are a little too jolly
for me I have been using a Beauty
Blender well not technically a beauty
blender I always call it beauty blender
just like I always call tissues Kleenex
like I never say can you give me a
tissue over say can you hand me a
Kleenex
even though Kleenex is a brand beauty
blender is a brand I have been using
this beauty sponge so much recently it
is like the only way that I've been
applying my foundation I don't know I'm
just like in it I'm in this beauty
blender phase right now I use my Beauty
Blender for everything like I'm using it
to highlight width I've been using it
for my concealer my foundation
everything I just love it I'm gonna grab
the tatcha luminous and dewy skin miss
cuz this is the way that I have been
applying my foundation recently I like
soaked my I stuck my sponge and then I
just like Pat everything in they feel
like it just not I feel like it does it
makes my foundation look so much more
natural and less cakey but that is also
because I am dry definitely so if your
oil II I might ask need a case for you
but I just love the way it makes my
foundation look overall like the end
result is just so much more flawless and
natural-looking
I'm gonna be testing out the new Kylie
cosmetics concealers today I am very
intrigued by them I'm gonna be going in
with the shade stone she did send me
every single shade in her PR kit her
shade range really does look awesome so
I will give her a thumbs up for that the
consistency is definitely different than
any concealer that I have tried in a
long time like she definitely didn't
like steal a formula from anybody you
know I'm saying like this honestly seems
like she wasn't inspired by anyone at
all this is very unique it almost feels
like paste when it goes on it does feel
a little dry and kaycee so I'm gonna
take my Beauty sponge and I'm going to
put a little bit of the tatcha luminous
dewy skin mist oh my god I look crazy
right now it's definitely a full
coverage concealer for sure which I
appreciate like I love a full coverage
concealer I don't even see the point in
a concealer that isn't full coverage I'm
like give it to me dirty give it to me
nasty just cover up that under-eye like
that's what I'm looking for my AC unit
and my new house has not been working
recently so I have had five men here
since 8:00 a.m. working on it and
they're still here right now like
installing a whole new unit it sucks cuz
like this is a brand new house and the
just not working is only the builders
decided to put in a really cheap unit
that was not fit or qualified for this
house at all so they're still here right
now and I'm just like down here filming
and they're like up in my attic I'm just
like like right now I can hear them with
like a vacuum cleaner oh my god I clean
my house is that gonna be a charge no
really I hear my vacuum cleaner hold on
okay that man was literally vacuuming my
floors yes bitch
okay so for today I'm going to be using
the laura mercier candle glow shear
perfecting powder in the shade one this
is the lips teeth this is the lightest
shade which I wish it was a little bit
lighter honestly and I'm not even the
palest girl in the entire world but I'm
gonna be using this because I just want
to try it out I've used like one time in
the past but I never use it with my
beauty sponges which is the way I've
been applying powder recently oh yes
that's so nice because it's like really
sheer it's not full coverage all which I
like my powder to be really sheer I like
a full mask of foundation with a sheer
powder over top I'm gonna grab the Kat
Von D shade of light contour palettes
I'm gonna go with the first shade right
here which is obviously my favorite
shade in the palette i'm gonna use this
side of the beauty sponge and Boop's
gonna tap it in there a little bit I'm
going to use that to set my under eye
area so now I have on my full mask it
literally looks like this is like a butt
chin like what is that okay I'm gonna go
in and do my brows real quick and
everyone does their brows differently so
I'm gonna just cut this out of the video
and I shall be right back looking very
crazy
I'm back and like I promised looking
scary I wipe it foundation off of my
lips but they are feeling a little
chapped so it's gonna throw some gloss
really quick okay so the first thing I'm
gonna do all my eyes is go in with a
bright red cream shadow base to really
make everything pop this is by makeup
geek right here in the shade poison I
don't even know if these are still sold
by makeup geek or if they were
discontinued but you can use anything
red and creamy I think NYX has some then
they're very inexpensive you can
honestly even use a red lipstick or a
liquid lip and just make sure that you
blend out pretty quickly I'm gonna pick
this up and just begin to Pat it all
over my entire lid as I'm doing this I'm
not gonna keep my eye like kind of saggy
like this I'm gonna like pull up my
eyebrow really high and really intense
so I have no wrinkles in my lids and I
can really see every single thing that
I'm doing that way that cream doesn't
settle in any of those lines that I can
really see exactly where I'm placing it
so right now you can see it's all over
the lid I'm gonna bring up a little I'm
gonna hit myself in the face I'm gonna
bring this up on the outer crease a
little bit higher cuz I am going to
extend this color up in this area so
it's gonna kind of drag it around here
stamping going back and forth like these
weird kind of patting dragging motions
I'm gonna grab another pencil brush and
just go over those edges cuz I really
want this to be as blended out as
possible because it'll just make
everything so much easier the more blood
this is once we start getting into the
powder shadows later okay so now I'm
gonna grab some translucent powder I am
just going to put this or anything my
eye we're gonna be going in with a lot
of dark intense and vibrant colors and I
don't it to ruin the base I have put all
over my face on the ride was so good
okay so for today's a look I'm going to
be using the Kylie cosmetics brush set
that she set right here the ever so
famous ever so popular ever so hated and
talked about brushes right here for
sixty dollars you can see I use the
first one right there on my bronzer I'm
gonna be using these so I can kind of
give you guys a review force impressions
of these as I am doing eye makeup I'm
gonna start off by going with the shade
creamsicle right here I'm gonna be using
the kylie jenner brush in number twelve
I'm just going to place this right along
the upper area where we blended that
cream shadow out just to give it that
warmth and make sure that it is looking
fine yeah this brush is much stiffer
than I'm used to but don't hate it
I feel like I might have to go in with
something a little bit looser and
fluffier here in a minute but let's see
let's feel it out let's see so now I'm
gonna pick up the shade Jack's right
here which is a matte burgundy red and I
actually don't have a brush from the
Kylie collection that I want to use
because I'm really looking for something
like the morphe m43 three that looks
like this right here sorry you gotta
focus it looks like that the closest one
that she has cuz the one I just used I
don't want to dirty that one's flat on
the top this one is 13 I'm just gonna
try it I was gonna try it and well I
know I'm scared because this isn't gonna
blend this brush isn't not gonna have
blending power oh bitch
okay um no no I'm gonna try to be uh
high minutes biatch but that brush is
just not doing what I needed to do I'm
not saying it's a bad brush it's just I
don't see anything in her in her brush
kit that is going to give me what I need
you know like as far as this moment so
I'm gonna go in with a different brush
I'm gonna grab a morphe brush this is
the r39 buy more feet right here I use
this earlier with like the same red
color so I'm going to just do that
instead because I can see where this is
going and it's not gonna be a good place
so we're gonna go ahead and do this
because I know it's gonna work
okay so I'm gonna go back in now with
that number thirteen brush from Kylie
and I'm gonna pick up a little bit of
the shade hunts right here in my palette
and I'm just gonna go right over that
edge I will set my brush just pick up
all shit's on a pigment much more than a
typical natural hair would but they are
also very compacted with bristle like
they're very stiff which is gonna pick
up like up a lot it's gonna continuously
go back and make sure this is completely
blended out barely touching it just
super super light so we don't have any
harsh blunt lines there on the edge okay
so now I'm gonna go back in with the
Kylee concealer in the shade stone and
I'm gonna pick up her brush in number 14
I'm going to carve out a little area in
the inner corner of my eye where I can
go in with some shadow and glitter so
I'm gonna put them the back of my hand
I'm gonna just scoop that up and then
I'm just gonna go in and Pat this area
this brush is definitely bigger than
what I would typically use for this but
we're just gonna see what happens right
now Laure be with us okay um I'm gonna
go in with the morphe m42 one and it's
just a smaller stiffer brush cuz I said
this is gonna like pack the punch that I
need and it just it's just better for
what I'm doing I'm gonna go in with the
shade Queen right here which is this
true gold shade from my palette I'm
gonna be picking up the same Mac 242 for
this because there's nothing in the
kylie kit that i can use for this as is
right now and the only brush that I
possibly could use for it is already
dirty because I just got done using it
so I'm going to pick this up I'm gonna
spray a little bit fix+ on it and I'm
going to tap it right on here I'm just
going to lightly tap this over on top of
that dark matte burgundy shade that I
put over here my brush is no longer wet
with fix+ it is just a tiny
then gold eyeshadow just kind of mesh it
all together then I'm gonna grab with
some makeup geek it's and make it kind
of day
my second make it be product in this
video I'm gonna use the pigment in the
shade liquid and gold and it is like
really really intense like woah ohhh
intense but I just feel like this is
gonna work like has got that really
intense green undertone it's gonna work
for the holidays he mat up on the exact
same brush I'm gonna just dab this right
in the inner corner oh yes I'm into this
I am in to this
okay so now I'm gonna go in with some
loose glitter because I just like I
can't do a holiday look without glitter
personally so this is the makeup forever
number 11 a loose glitter so in order to
make this glitter stick you have to use
a glitter glue you cannot just take a
glitter and put on your eye it might
look cute for five seconds but it's
gonna fall it's gonna ruin your lash
it's gonna ruin your makeup so my
favorite glitter glue ever is the lit
cosmetics glitter glue it is a little
bit of a page because it's online it
only but still it is so worth it and a
bottle will last you forever so I'm
gonna do something to dip my brush right
into that lit cosmetics glitter glue get
it a little damp and then I'm going to
tap wherever I'm going to want that
glitter to stick then I'm gonna dip my
brush right into that glitter and I have
a ton on my brush right there I'm gonna
tap off on my hand a little bit the
excess so it's just like that and then
I'm going to place it really lightly
over top of it
oh my god I'm obsessed okay I'm gonna
grab a brush I'm gonna dust away
this under-eye area so though we can't
work on the lower lash line I'm gonna
pick up the shade enchanted right here
in the bottom center of my palate which
is like this Matt kind of for ste hunter
green I'm gonna use a morphe brush again
this is the M 508 because Kaia doesn't
have like a really small precise brush
like this in her kit and I'm just going
to press this right here on my lower
lash line and just drag it all the way
from the outer corner to the inner
corner of my eye right next to enchanted
I'm gonna grab the shade diva right here
which is one of my favorite colors in
the palette I mean I say that pretty
much about every still color and I'm
just gonna basically go right over what
we just applied and just blend that out
so on my lower lashline to be definitely
green I'm gonna pick the first shade up
in my palette which is called in light
I'm going to use that to highlight the
inner corner of my eyes it really is a
makeup geek day for me you guys because
I want to put a little bit of the make a
beak Vodou a foiled pigment on my lower
lash line really quickly because it is
so green like nothing Trump's this green
I just want to put a little pop of this
oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes my
inner waterline really quickly with some
black liner this is by ardency in it is
my favorite cool pen silver
okay let me just pop on some lashes and
I'll be right back what a difference
lashes make right like transformed at
least enough for bronzer I'm gonna be
using the hoola bronzer by benefit which
is like the perfect shade of bronzer
when you are really really fair like I
am right now
I'm going to go in with the Kylie Jenner
brush in number one right here I'm still
trying to figure out why these brushes
cost so much you guys it's gonna be real
and I'm not a shady person I'm really
really not I do know that natural hair
is more to manufacture I get it I do not
understand
with this packaging this hollow
packaging on the inside like it is
literally the same
Packaging as the more fecal collection
right here if you can tell like they
feel the exact same they both have the
same rim like they are the exact same
thing it's not a complete kit if you ask
me like there's been several time in
this video where I've had to grab other
brushes from other brands because this
kit does not have everything I need to
complete a look and for $360 I want to
have every single brush that I need to
complete my look go ahead and grab this
brush and just bronzing the face I don't
know I definitely would like them to be
a little bit heavier unhappy better
range of brushes in this kit for that
price carve that out a little bit early
quick just because I don't want it to
look sloppy I don't want like a harsh
contour but I only need slap eNOS today
not today Satan
okay I'm gonna contour my nose now I'm
going to use the exact same hoola
bronzer and I'm going to go in with the
Kylie brush in number 11 actually a
really nice brush for a nose contour I
will say when I first saw the kit I was
like what am I gonna use this brush for
it's like a harsh line so I don't really
want to blend with it but this is
actually kind of nice for this for me
when it comes to getting the best nose
contour the actual contour powder is
only the first step translucent powder
is what really transforms my actual nose
shape and gives me the best results so I
do the contour powder and then I sculpt
out the side of my nose with the harsh
side of this beauty sponge is that this
is dark then it kind of defeats the
purpose of a nose contour and then I put
a line right down the center of my nose
as well so I'm trying to like talk and
do it at the same time for my cheeks I'm
going to use Mac Melba blush I'm going
to use the Kylie brush in number three
this is actually a really really
beautiful blush brush like I only had to
touch my cheek for a half a second and I
actually really I do like this blush
brush a lot brush it off the side of my
nose okay for highlight I'm gonna be
going in with the makeup forever starlet
pout
in number 13 this is one of my favorite
highlights ever it's so beautiful
especially when I'm really fair like I
love this I'm gonna using be Kylie brush
in number 15 um I typically like my have
any brushes to be a little bit bigger
than this but I'm gonna use it for this
anyways I think she meant this to be a I
shadow brush but it's a too big for my
eyes and a little bit smaller than what
I prefer for my cheeks but you know what
we're gonna make it work because when a
highlight is this good you really can't
mess up no matter what brush you use hmm
yes yes yes I don't understand why I
always have texture on the right side of
my cheeks you know what's weird is that
it only pops up when I'm here in Florida
but soon as I travel it only takes 24
hours and it goes away it's so weird
I've tried work bitch okay so now for
the lips I'm gonna be using a lip
product I have not yet tried and this is
the YSL liquid lipstick and it is a
bright rikes I thought why not make this
extra Christmassy I typically don't do a
bold eye look like this with a bold lip
out typically just do a nude I'm like
why not oh this little brush is very
interesting okay
it's kind of cool because it's like a
liner and I liquid lip all in one goes
got so precise brush I haven't seen this
one before it's so innovative okay that
applied like a wet dream I did not rely
my lips a for the first time honestly in
like two years it's not like let's turn
it out a little bit and just do a
natural lip line you know since the eyes
are so crazy and it feels weird for me
actually a little bit so I'm always so
used to do just a little bit of an over
line on the Cupid's bow but we're
rolling with it so last been all Ethan's
gonna set my face I'm using the morphe
prep and set the makeup setting spray
oh all right you guys so this is the
finished look right here as you saw at
the beginning of the video I hope that
you enjoy this holiday kind of get ready
with me makeup tutorial very class miss
class miss Christmas classic oh wow
Mama's tired keep in mind that to
recreate this look you do not need the
exact products that I use in today's
video you can recreate this look with
any glitters any shadows any pigments
that you have at home I will say though
that this liquid lipstick formula is
absolutely beautiful now I have not worn
it all day or for several hours I have
not been eating or drinking anything
I've only had it on for about 30 minutes
at this point so I can't really like
give you like a true like wear test
yeah wear test but just my first initial
impression is this is probably one of
the best formulas I've ever used it oh
yeah see that's good to know like it's
not 100% like liquid lip like not going
anywhere but it is like so moisturizing
I just feels like my natural lip doesn't
feel like I have anything on it all it's
so lightweight
thumbs up to why I sell for creating
something so beautiful and luxurious and
unique like this is awesome that I say
you guys happy holidays and Merry
Christmas if you recreate this look and
anyway she performed make sure to tag me
on instagram twitter snap and whatever
you do okay I'll be there waiting I love
you guys and I'll see you my next one
