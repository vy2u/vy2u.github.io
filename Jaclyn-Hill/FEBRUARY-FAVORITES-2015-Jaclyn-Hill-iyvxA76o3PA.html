favorites today I was not planning on
filming a favorites video this month
I even tweeted you guys about it earlier
today and there were so many of you that
were disappointed and so many sad faces
at all like oh maybe I should do one I
just feel like I've done so many
favorites like I did like my yearly
favorite signs in my January favorites
and I just feel like they're just I did
my December favorites like there's just
been a lot of favorites videos recently
and I am really excited to do a few
makeup tutorials so I was gonna skip
this but I was like hey I have this
afternoon off I don't have to do
anything until later today so like why
not just sit down and just do a
favorites right now so that's what we're
doing today it's not going to be your
typical favorites videos because
favorites video from me because I have
makeup but I also have a few things
outside of makeup that I want to talk
about okay so let's just get started I
have to give a quick disclaimer before
jumping into this video I am not at all
myself today like to put it very mildly
it's just that time of the month and I
am NOT on point at all like I I told my
husband today I was like I feel like my
head is not screwed onto my body today
like I was trying to get Advil I'm the
bottle and I was like why isn't it
coming out and the cap was on and I'm
like and then I went to get a granola
bar and instead of putting like the box
back in the pantry I put it in a
refrigerator just walked away and I was
like why did I just do that like I'm
just not it's just a bad day as my
husband is calling me what do you want
and he hung up because he was
immediately scared I'm telling you don't
mess with me this time a month so let's
jump into my favorite shall we at tons
of lip products talk about what's new so
I'm going to start with those three new
lipsticks came out this month from dry
cosmetics and I love all three of them
so much for entirely different reasons
so let's start off with the first one
I'm most excited about and this is
called kimchi doll kimchi - kimchi
kimchi doll okay it's just like a hard
word for me to say for some reason
kimchi doll when Sophia says it it's so
much cuter for me it just doesn't work
this lipstick was created by Sophia
Chang here on YouTube which I absolutely
love her I have watched her for years I
just think that she's the cutest little
thing I think
style is so on point I just adore her so
Sophia you're watching this video I love
you and I'm so proud of you girl this is
amazing so this is what she created by
the way if you guys know who she is I
will link her channel down below so you
can check her out fashionista 8:04 I
believe this anyway so this is her
lipstick that she created with drug
cosmetics and it is the most beautiful
peachy pink nude it is extremely light
you can see from back here you can
probably barely even see it I am going
to swatch my lipstick next snap
buttercups that you guys can see so I
know that some of you guys have tweeted
me asking me what they look like next to
each other so I'm going to show you
buttercup and keeps you doll and you can
see the Buttercup is going to be a lot
Pinker and shade buttercup by itself
looks like a very nude pink but then
when you see it next to kimchi doll
you're like oh hey it looks like a lot
Pinker you know I'm saying so they are
very different even though they're
Gerrard's to kind of nudish pinks /
peach they're extremely different as you
can see right here the way I have been
wearing kimchi doll for the past week is
I have been pairing it with this la girl
cosmetics lip liner in the shade I
believe it's just called natural because
I don't see oh it is yeah it's just
called natural and this kind of looks
like a topi Brown which I would
personally not think it's something that
I would want to wear with kimchi at all
but for some reason one day I just
grabbed it and I tried it and I was like
dying sometimes I can't take myself
seriously anyways so I will take this
lip liner put it all over my lips and
I'll take kimchi don't I'll put it
mainly in the center but then I will
blend it out because I don't like that
look of having like a kind of harsh
liner on the outer edge like everything
to be very seamless and blended
what do you know I like things blend it
we know Jacqueline Rodeo Drive is the
next one I want to talk about this is a
completely different formulation in the
rest of them Rodeo Drive is so creamy
and it's more on the sheer side my mom
when she tried Rodeo Drive for the first
time she was like this is it this is my
lipstick Jacqueline she was so excited
my mom loves this this is like her new
favorite go-to lip color so for those of
you who are maybe looking for a color
that is like the color of your lips but
just a little bit better
that's Rodeo Drive it is absolutely
beautiful and it has like a nice little
sheer kind of gloss to it so it's just
gorgeous it'll work for so many
different skin tones this
when you first look at it you can go hey
I'm going to swatch it and it's going to
be creamy and pigmented as convenience
going to come out this exact lip color
it doesn't which is why I personally
like it because I don't really wear
colors like this like if you look at it
on me like you've never seen you in this
color before because I just don't do it
I think it kind of washes me out but
what I love about this is when it comes
off on your hand or your lips you're not
gonna be wearing this on your hand it
doesn't come off super crazy pigmented
it's a little bit more subdued when you
swatch it so did you kind of like a
light kind of pastel baby pink as
opposed to like boom pink your arms
saying I have three lippie stix of thumb
I just love that name lippie stix
they're so cute I'm from colour-pop
cosmetics right here I want to talk
about I've been wearing these three
constantly throughout the month of
February the first I'm going to talk
about is Lumiere which was made by the
beautiful and absolutely adorable
Kathleen light I'm so excited I'm
talking about two products that
youtubers have made like I'm so happy
for both of you that you guys create
these products I just think that it's so
awesome I love it
when youtubers and makeup artist and
whoever beauty bloggers create products
because I feel like they typically have
a very good idea what works and what
doesn't work because of the fact that
this is what they do they review
products they're constantly trying new
things I always trust the products that
they're gonna create you know I'm saying
so I was so excited to try this and this
is in the shade
Lumiere it's so beautiful so it is like
this very rich kind of mommy purpley
shade I don't know how she is describing
it but that's how I would describe it is
a rich Mabi purple you shake it is so
gorgeous I also love this color because
I can kind of mix it up with the way I
wear I can put a new gloss over top I
can put a dark lip liner underneath it's
definitely one of those colors that can
really transform on the lips I love it I
think it is so pretty and very different
as well the two other ones I've been
loving are the shade of Skippy which is
so cute and this is just a very pale new
because you guys know me I love my nudes
but I just have the consistency of this
is what it goes on it's like a gloss and
did I mention these are so stinking
cheap they're like five bucks and they
smell someone tweeted me is they smell
like Cabbage Patch Kids and I was like
yeah
like average bad kid skimpy doesn't
smell like Cabbage Patch Kids but cookie
does so this is cookie and this is more
of a brown kind of peachy nude right
here so if you're someone who doesn't
like like a nude nude like the kimchi
doll and the cookie I'm sorry and the
skimpy then you would like one like the
cookie right here which is a little bit
more Brown still gorgeous new to
actually love it so those are the
colour-pop lippie six last the products
is the chorus lip butter I have been
loving this I only had like two weeks
but I've been loving it for the past two
weeks and it comes like this in a little
pot and it comes in all different shades
in colors and this is just the colorless
one it's just like a creamy white and it
goes on and you don't see anything but
this has just been so amazing on my lips
I am all about lip butters just
chopsticks anything is going to
moisturize my lips you guys should see
my nightstand I have like a little
drawer that is just filled I just think
that it really does help with my chapped
lips there's some lip products that I
can reapply reapply reapply I just like
it's not actually penetrating to my lips
and helping with my chattiness it's just
like sitting on my lips and just
disappearing so this actually has been
helping me and I've been loving it again
that's the coarse lip butter oh that's
this is the new blushed copper skimming
skimming Wow shimmering skin perfecter
from becca cosmetic i cannot believe how
many of you saw this and notice it in my
drawer in my makeup collection video was
like what is that well you knew i was
going to talk about it hello it's from
becca and if it's from becca and it's a
highlighter i'm going to be talking
about it so this is the shade blush
copper it has a new packaging it has
like the copper all around the edge
super pretty and this is a product that
they have never done before in the sense
that they have created highlighters this
is a shimmering skin perfecter but this
product is actually supposed to go over
top of the blush not the actual high
points of the cheekbones I am wearing
this on my cheeks right now I just put
on like any normal blush and then I took
a blush brush and I very lightly went
over it this is extremely pigmented so
you are going to want to use like a damn
tub and then just lightly go on the
apples of your cheeks I have to mention
this brush because this is I've been
using for highlighting my cheeks I have
to mention this brush because this is
all I've been using to highlight my
cheeks recently this is the morphe m50
one this is part of their new brush
collection it just came out it's like a
blending
collection that they released oh my god
I love this brush so much I used to use
the Sigma tapered highlighting brush to
highlight my cheekbones mmm that's gone
I still use that to set my under eye
concealer but this has taken my number 1
spot for highlighting so I will use this
to highlight the tops of my cheekbones
my Cupid's bow my chin my nose whatever
I'm going to highlight this is what I'm
using the length of the bristles are
just perfect the way it tapers up to a
point is just ideal this brush is just
amazing it's just so spot on if you're
going on with a really intense highlight
let's let's say mary lou manizer by the
balm you're not going to go in with a
really big brush because it's such an
intense highlight so something like this
is so perfect you just like doesn't put
a little bit in there and you have such
a perfect precise highlight so that is
the more feet and 5:01 if you have a
discount from morphe Jack Attack and all
caps and it will save you 10% math fix
plus I know I talked about mac's fix+
forever I've used this since like my
very first video but still I have to
talk about it because this month I
pretty much gone through all of this
because I haven't using this to spray my
f80 kabuki brush by Sigma before
applying my foundation and I have been
loving it if you are dry I recommend
taking something like a mac fix+ wetting
your brush with it and then going in and
applying your foundation it will share
your foundation out a little bit and it
will also help moisturize and give you a
nice dewy for me natural look it doesn't
make me do it just makes my skin look a
little more natural and not as dry so
Matt fix+ has been life throughout all
of them this is super random I know and
I haven't even posted a picture of me
wearing this yet this is makeup geek
sharkbait eyes shadow this is going to
be I'm just making a prediction this is
going to take my favorite color of the
summer I can tell you right now I only
want more this one time this month but I
have to put in this video just because I
know that this is one of those colors is
going to be my favorite this right here
is just that perfect color for just
smoking out your lower lash line and
getting a super fun pop of color for
spring and summer and that's what I did
earlier this month I use this just to
smoke up my lower lash line and I was
like this is my new favorite shadow ever
I've never ever seen a color like this
it's like a turquoise blue it's not it's
not
Green we get it's not like a blue blue
it's like a turquoise blue and it's just
like so perfect it's matte like Hello
this shadow is everything that sharpens
so my next favorite is actually super
random because I've never ever this is
the first time people first time in
almost three years of YouTube that I
have done this and shown a piece of
clothing in a favorites video like I've
never done a clothing haul I never show
clothes in videos ever like how weird is
this this is a moment can we can we just
okay so obsessed I just had to talk
about this jacket because I just felt
like for some reason with something that
I should share with you guys because
it's just so cool and it's so different
I just thought that the price was really
great for how much detail was put into
this and I think that it would look good
on so many different people so many
different body shapes I just think this
jacket is it's just freakin awesome too
badass jacket and I love it so I posted
a picture wearing it yesterday on
Instagram I actually found out about it
because my sister she is the one who
found it first
I'm such a copycat but listen
something's never change I'm going to
copy my big sister for the rest of my
life and I'm sure that rachel is used to
it I will show you a picture of both of
us wearing it side-by-side you can see
how we styled it and how it fits us both
I just love this it has shoulder pads in
it which i think is amazing because it
gives you just like a nice defined sharp
shoulder it has these awesome
embellishments of like these studs but
the studs are like a pyramid jagged
shape and then this double layer fold
over like yes on point and the best part
about this jacket is the shape that it
has in the structure how it's like a
peplum it goes in and cinches the waist
and then kind of flares out it's just so
flattering it gives you a waist even if
you don't have one it's just so girly
and the cutouts in the back like it is
just so cute and I love this army green
color it's just so militant girly and
edgy at the same time I just love love
love this jacket so I'll link it down
below if any of you guys are curious I
know it's random by I think it's so cool
and for those of you who are asking this
is a UK size 6 this is a u.s. two and a
UK six because I know some of you were
saying if you didn't know what size to
order if they don't have size chart
online you feel like you could base off
of my size UK size six and my sister is
the exact same size as me she was
wearing the same
so that's that okay you guys are
probably thinking what are you doing but
honestly I'd have to talk about this so
I posted a picture on Instagram holding
a Voss water bottle stop to the brim
with fruits talking about how addicted
and obsessed I have been recently with
fruit infused water and that is exactly
what I want to talk about because this
is like everything to me if you guys
have like concoctions that you want to
suggest to help me them in the comments
down below because I am addicted to this
right now so of course putting in a box
of water bottle it works great because
the opening of Voss is like really large
so you can push anything in there then
take it on the go
but for me when I'm hanging out at home
I'm not going to spend my money on Voss
water bottles to hang on the house of
your leg so in here right now I have
lemon cucumber and mint and I wish you
guys could see because like it's really
pretty
anyways I've been making tons of
different concoctions recently oh my
gosh I love orange pineapple mint and
lime huh
dye so good and I keep filling this up
and I will reuse that fruit like I'll
put that in there I'll fill this up
we'll start going through it and I'll
pour more water in it I will reuse reuse
that fruit so that I'm not just like
wasting fruit and then when the water is
gone my husband usually eats the fruits
left over in there because he's just
like a fruit junkie listen you could
have worse problems it's such a great
way to juice a little something extra
healthy for your body and it just makes
water even more fun like I personally
drink water all the time like I force
myself because I know I need to but it
just makes it more fun and tastes so
good and refreshing and you just feel
more hydrated because you're just like
oh yes this is so crisp so I absolutely
love water infused with fruit alrighty
guys so that complete time every
favorite video I know it was probably
extremely long so thanks for hanging out
with me I hope that you guys enjoy you
know the drill as always leave your
comments down below what your favorites
have been for the past month I always
want to know tell me what I need in my
life even though I don't need anything
my life tell me what I should have in my
life and I will be reading your comments
as always don't forget if you have any
kind conscience that I should try out in
my water let me know that too because
it's my new obsession I hope you guys
enjoy thank you so much for watching I
love you
