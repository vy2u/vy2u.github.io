going to be doing my no makeup makeup
looks super natural so let's get started
hey guys it's over today's video I'm
going to be doing the full face
highlighters challenge I don't know it's
actually called the basically this
beautiful makeup artist from Dubai her
name is Marya she's the one who
originated this in the first place she
did a video it took a quick little
three-minute video where she just does
her entire face using only highlighters
and it took off the world fell in love
with it there were articles written
about her and I'll link that down below
so you guys can see the original and
then it turned into a challenge and now
here we are so I'm really excited to do
this it's obviously not going to be an
everyday look it's not going to be
anything practical but that's the point
it's something fun and I feel like it's
genius because we're all so obsessed
with highlighters and it's like why not
just take it there just take it there
I'll be honest I feel like my entire
life has led to this moment and I've
never been more excited to film a video
in my entire life
so I'm sure this is gonna be a total
nightmare but let's get started okay so
I just concealed my under-eye area
really quick just and I don't have like
a crazy dark circles before jumping in
so let's do this so for foundation I'm
going to be mixing two highlighters
exposure business I'm excited this is
like my dream come true okay I'm going
to using the custom enhancer drops by
cover effects which are literally like
liquid metal I'm gonna use the shade
celestial and sunlight and I'm going to
do mainly sunlight but mix a little bit
of celestial in that way it's not like
too brown on my skin I thought it was so
excited so I'm just gonna oh my god okay
so I was gonna go ahead and buff this in
like its foundation oh my god I don't
know why this feels so incredible this
is gonna look terrible this is going to
look absolutely terrible I had high
hopes but now that I'm blending this on
I'm like no this is not gonna be good
guys oh God the top lip the top lip is
gonna look so greasy I've been having
sweaty mustache I can't even look at
myself in here
okay so I'm not gonna lie because I have
like a sickness when it comes to
highlight I actually don't hate this now
I do hate the fact that it's making all
my pores look gigantic um but I don't
mind beaming to the gods I won't lie I'm
going to begin to set my face using
Prosecco pop as my setting powder oh my
god oh god that upper lip oh that upper
lip is gonna be the death of me it looks
like such a sweaty mess okay okay okay
pot it oh my god - you look at myself oh
dear God that is not cute these are now
we're going to contour and for
contouring I'm going to be using the
anastacio glow kit in that glow I'm
going to use golden bronze right here
looks pretty good to me right let's find
out hmm not bad yes we're just gonna
worry where you get all the war get the
hairline Steph I okay so here's my thing
is that I need to bake I can't do my
makeup without baking so I need I need
something to come through right now so
that I can bake um I mean I'm gonna just
use some Becca pearl right now because I
don't know how to do my makeup without
baking so
so now I'm just going to blend that
bacon out it's not working exactly the
same as my translucent powder but make
it work make it work I'm going to work
I'm going to use the cindy lou manizer
by the balm which is like a light pink
as a blush now if you're even gonna be
able see it though that's the problem
let's find out oh you can and it's kind
of pretty
ok I'm gonna like bring it back because
I feel like my face just needs help Lord
Jesus I know
okay I'm fine with that
yes make it work make its work to
highlight my cheekbones I'm gonna use
some pearl by Becca and champagne pop
combined
yes highlight yes okay I didn't know if
it was gonna actually show up but it is
hmm give me some oh my goodness yes skin
texture how are you you look amazing
never forget the tip of the nose upper
lip you know to look plumper we always
want to look plumper okay now I need a
darker color so I'm going to use
mary-lou manizer by I'm sorry Betty
lou manizer by the balm gonna put some
of that on here and put that in the
crease oh god oh god it's just me
washes off you know just like a subtle
bronzy beachy look there's more the eyes
kinda like a golden glow nothing too
over the top six super subtle okay so
now I'm gonna take some diamond powder
by artist Couture and I'm going to use
the shade broadway which is a pinky rose
gold I'm gonna spray it my brush so that
it's damp so that I can get more like a
metallic look with these on my lid
alright oh this is really pretty
love it okay now I'm going to highlight
the brow bone with a little bit more of
Becca pearl I'm adding champagne pop
because lord help us all I'm going to go
with a little bit more betty loumanizer
and just blend this out you know so that
things just look a little more natural
mmm I'm going to take peach mosaic by
Laura Mercier I'm going to take this
copper color down here at the very
bottom and I'm going to put that on my
under eye area so I can get like that
kind of burnt orange smoky look that I
love so much
I'm going to take this color right here
and blend out the under-eye this goes
against everything I've ever been taught
in my entire life I feel so backward
right now I'm sorry
I have to do a little bit to my brows
because this is just like terrifying
like I feel like maybe my brows will
help the situation a little bit maybe
maybe for the love of God
okay I'm gonna pop on some false lashes
by ghalichi glam in the style Miami okay
so now I'm going to coat my lower lashes
with some mascara okay so now for lips
I'm going to go in with Mac Kreme Kup
lipstick and oldie but a goodie
I'm going to add a little bit of
highlight in the center of my forehead
so that it doesn't look you know so dull
so to finish this off I'm going to use
some chill makeup setting spray by urban
decay you know so that everything gets a
little bit more natural
alright you guys so that completes the
full face of highlighter I hope you like
this video this was definitely a
challenge to say the least and felt very
unnatural especially going in with a
bronzy shimmer and my crease of my eye
that was like the weirdest experience of
my entire life but I challenge you guys
to do this because it's kind of fun and
you can really see how many pores you
truly have and how many oncoming
breakouts are under the skin it's really
just a it's a beautiful experience so I
hope that you guys have fun trying this
yourself at home make sure you send me
pictures I love you guys thanks for
watching and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
