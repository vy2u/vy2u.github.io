me I was wondering if you'd like to play
with make up in two or three hello
everyone they try to lower my voice and
not scream as much because I get caught
at all time saying you're screaming I
mean a whole video it's so annoying I'm
like yeah I guess that prefer some
reason it's like especially what I get
excited like it's over like I'm just
like that just mean take care leave it
it so for today's video I have never
done this before and I am literally so
excited but I feel like a kid going to
Disney World
like for the first time I am sewing a
full face of first impression the towel
kind speaks for itself I'm sure most of
you are familiar with that but those of
you who have not heard this I'm going to
using all the products say on my face I
have not used and you were going to be
witnessing my bridges drive into those
products on camera and I am surprised by
it you want to hear how I am
honest to god is so embarrassing I need
to get better like it like so today at
my friend's couch maybe like three or
four months ago and I had advice any
makeup products and I was like oh my
gosh you know he's such an amazing video
if I get an entire full face of makeup
with all brand new products it will be
like a full face of first impressions
instead of just like one first
impression you like a whole face what
did I think so oh I don't know every
time I saw an eye view to be typed in
full face of first impressions if you
ever been done and like oh my god there
was a millions of results not to mention
like my friends here on you to have done
it several times and I'm like I need to
figure it out so basically there was a
good 5 minutes period where I was like
girl give me a cocktail win celebrate -
screams book amazing video I you know
like really in your Jacqueline's like no
you should probably start paying
attention a little bit more because this
has been done literally laying design so
NIC up talking let's get into this
people let's do it so first thing is
first I'm going to be using it deets if
we double whatever I know this is called
but it's a timer and it's a phantom ass
is alright so I'm going to go ahead and
pick it up one full pump what will pop
that's it and I am going to diss
massages into the skin mm-hmm if you'll
kind of tacky with like a jelly
consistency just in case you were
curious what it feels like I'm going to
just describe it as I go
I'm actually really hoping I don't fall
out with them because then I will be
committed to purchasing a $2 primer like
every three months and I would come down
for that
so hopefully this event Bob otherwise
I'll be screwed so now there's on the
skin and kind of dry it feels tacky it
doesn't feel like smooth or matte at all
it has like a sticky consistency like my
fingers are like sticking to my skin
which I personally like because a lot of
times those types of primer work really
well with your foundation sticks to it
like glue
so for foundations today I'm going to be
going on with the cover FX total
coverage cream at foundation I'm going
to be using shade g20 which I have found
is my pale shade without my spray tan
I'm stand alone with my regular
foundation brush I always use that way I
can really get a good impression of
foundation I'm going to swirl it around
in here what are the claimed on this
foundation it is an antioxidant rich
cream foundation and concealer in one
that provides radiant full coverage okay
fabulous all I'm really asking for
foundations I'm going to go ahead and
scroll I brush around and then begin to
tap it on high coverage how are these
dams doesn't get a lot of coverage okay
cover it back the way it is applying
honestly just first impression clearly
like I haven't even gotten on my full
face but I originally this is going to
want to be this is going to be one of my
new favorite foundation like it's going
on so creamy it was so much coverage so
point of concealer today it's the only
thing that I'm not going to be doing
like a new first impression up I'm just
using the heart-shaped tape which is my
favorite concealer at the moment because
this is the only consider that I have
right now that is new which is the it
cosmetics bye bye under-eye illumination
concealer and I put it on a couple of
days ago and I did not like it for today
I'm going to fix what I know and just
use guitar-shaped tape but I am going to
be using a newer Beauty flux right I was
going to call a Beauty Blender and try
condom Beauty sponges I'm going to using
a new beauty sponge by morphe because I
always use in this one it's the hell
atomic
that will forever be stuck with me now
oh I'm excited because I think I'm
really going to like this when it comes
to baking because of this harsh edge
we're going to try this one today on my
under-eye oh yeah it's just like the
exact same thing obviously the exact
same sponge exacting texture which is
more pointed which initially is really
nice even getting closer to my eye and
with this one that I usually do with
this one like I can feel I can get
closer and here and close to this one
it's way more rowdy out so that
definitely is an advantage okay the
foundation is looking and beautiful see
all those wrinkles coming back to my
forehead botox is wearing off okay girl
hair away okay so for my face power
today I'm going to be trying the new
well it's not new I don't think but it's
new to me it's the charlotte tilbury
airbrush flawless finish skin perfecting
micro powder down and I'm going to use
this date lemare powder brush which
lemare actually extends me a couple of
weeks ago which is so sweet so thank you
to them there it was an awesome package
to receive I have not used this power
yet duh the first impressions video oh
it's a little bit too dark hold on okay
I also bought the lightest color which
is in shade one I want to go over top of
it yeah that's definitely my color
okay so honestly I'm not gonna lie to
you this brush is freaking bomb I'm sure
it costs same price in a car but it's
bomb that powder
honestly oh look bu - oh my god
holy ok nice touch the powder oh my gosh
my skin feels like butter yeah this
looks so smooth and nice on my skin yes
he comes through Charlotte Tilbury
so now for eyebrows I'm going to be
using something other than the NSL via
brow definer
which is insane but I found this
Charlotte Tilbury brow lift brow pencil
it's called the 3 Way shape tool and
it's interesting because one side is a
brow pencil the other side is a sleep
but then here in the middle it's like a
power highlight that comes out to
highlight the brow bone just first
impression of it it looks definitely a
little gritty and a little glittery I'm
a little bit too dark for me to
personally highlight with right now I
don't know if you can see on my hand
because golden undertone at all so I'm
not going to be using that to highlight
by and when using the brow pencil
obviously when I saw some line I'll we
got real similar to that of a brow
definer and then when I got in the mail
I was like that is a nostalgia
gratifying I got is the exact same thing
efficient the packaging and everything
different fully though I think yes honey
I know my headaches obvious spoolie is a
difference buoy this one is way more
short and abrupt this one has more of a
rounded tip and it is longer so
schoolies are different I feel no
difference holding this in my hand I
feel no difference applying it to my
brows it feels the exact same product
the only difference is this elite and I
actually prefer the Anasazi is fully
over and this one because the NS
obviously is round on the top so I'm
able to kind of get in there more and
blend better with that one as opposed to
the Charlotte to everyone so for
eyeshadow today I'm going to be going in
with the androgyny palette by jeffree
star cosmetics I received this on
Saturday the day before yesterday so
thank you to Jeffrey and his team for
sending it to me it looks like this in
case you have not seen it that I want to
find you guys and let's point the mirror
and the light but it's got a really
really nice like clear manner like when
you go get yourself in it like it's a
really good mirror is actually really
heavy to look at like fallbacks like a
really heavy like solid mirror and then
the palette itself looks like this now
just being honest when I first saw this
palette like on Instagram and on
I didn't die for it like my jaws may
drop I wasn't like a like oh I need that
I was thing although there were some
pretty colors in there and I was
basically the end of this I mean until I
saw it in person when he said to me I
opened it up I was like okay I see
mediately got inspired to create
something different so it's kind of a
look in mind I want to go for today so
let's see how it turns out I'm going to
start off with safe words which is
definitely like a very neutral map so
kind of light brown and just applying
this with a fluffy brush this is the
morphe r37 I'm just going to put that in
the whole crease for today's look I want
to keep this like kind of a halo smokey
eye like I wanted to be just as intense
in the airport is an outer part I'm
going to bring this totally inward
alright now I'm going to grab the a
light orange shade right here into the
shade charm it is a matte but it has
like little flecks of sparklin it is
that expense like how can be matte as
far but it like you know i'm sanna gives
a matte shade but it's got little tiny
Cherie flecks in it
I'm going to go great over top
this has a really nice pigment so far
both shades have had great pigment in
them Wow I'm going to go in with fetish
girl you already knew that I was going
to go in with fetish let's get real I'm
going to tap this really gently I don't
have too much cause my brush right now
I'm going really lightly I'm gonna need
an even more so do the right to the eyes
if you guys want to be all up in my she
it I'm scared of like getting a lot of
fallout so much tapping off so much of
the excess that's what that noise is I'm
tapping my brush girl it's like a
burgundy ish ready her believe Wow
actually impressed with this like for
real I wouldn't go out of my way to live
you guys I'm for real impressed with
this color holy it's going to grab a
little bit smaller brush and hit that in
a Kona
I don't know why I always look I have to
look away when I do this I go the
opposite direction so I could get it in
there like nice and deep
that's what she said okay now I'm going
to pick up some of the darkest shade in
the palette which is this dark matte
chocolatey Brown hello color like that
like that spongy like warm deep matte
Brown I love it it's called dominatrix
kind of wise then come through to
everything recently at the past month to
start off as a joke the guys hear people
say all the time like me and my friends
when Dan ahjussi on the couch is being
super silly when night recently coming
to Brazil E and we've kept me might come
through water yeah coming through TV
like and we're just being so ridiculous
laughing our asses off and now we've
actually turn into a real habit so now
I'm actually saying come through to
everything I'm with a penny to stop this
habit because getting it watch it I'm
going to grab this like yellowy shimmery
shade right here it's called frosting on
a flat synthetic brush this is being Mac
242 I'm going to put that in the center
of the lid okay I want this to be more
vibrant I'm in spray my brushes and fix+
I swear I feel like honest to god I
don't think I even use shimmer on my lid
anymore unless I spray my brush like I
never just put a shimmer and walk away
I always spray my brush does it just
look at what it does it just gives it so
much more a pop and like good one I want
that pop those two colors together
giving me a major fall vibe I'm just
going with a little bit more of that
brush size shape make sure that you have
any harshness I don't like like abruptly
drink your gold I want it to be a nice
gradient soft sage there we go my lower
lash line I want to swing fun and
difference is keeping it all red and
gold I want to do it like a pop of color
so I'm going to initially go in with
military right there because this matte
army green is just everything to me when
it's yellow undertone it's so freaking
pretty I'm going to blend that green all
the way from outer corner to inner
corner oh my god I celebrate all right
now I'm going to pick up a this little
definer brush I'm going to go in with
the shade poison right
next to it which is also a mess and I'm
going to put that really tight on my
actual lash line this color oh my god so
now it's in a part that I had been demos
inside for this entire video because I
have they're waiting to use his products
for like a week and a half if you guys
saw my Sephora haul
I bought these are most every single
shade and they are the Stila
magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid eye shadow oh my god I cannot
believe I have resisted using these for
that lives watching on my hands a
million times but I've never actually
worn them so I was going to dab it right
over the goal in the center of the eye
and see what happened let duties oh
honey
Brooke no let how much it put on I don't
know I don't want to stop oh god someone
stop me if that just took this look to a
whole other level I'm going to take a
totally clean brush and just kind of
like see what happens I don't really
know how to work with these yet more
like right there oh he's actually dry
much quicker than I expected
I'm going to wipe off that glitter that
fell and because I powder my face just
comes right off thanks goodness is there
anyone else double right now in time you
like little tiny orgasms over this gold
glitter because I really like ice I
think it made by myself I try to work
quicker this time now I know that it
drives fast so let's just get this on
there while still wet I'm going to
immediately kind of push it around
little bitch okay that was way in your
experience now I kind of know how to
look with them I'm going to pop on some
lashes really quick and I will be right
back ok so now eyelashes are on it is
officially getting dark behind me so the
lighting is changing a lot I apologize
for that
be the new Marc Jacobs they're called
Highliner they are math gel eye Crandall
off recently they have another
shimmering some that are matte and I
want to use this turquoise one in my
inner rims and it might be kind of a fun
pop of color I haven't used these yet it
is so cool alright we just draw on some
mascara real quick on my lower lashes
for bronzer I'm going to be using it the
Alexis red x color pop bronzer and
highlighter very pigmented and
definitely a very orange e terracotta
undertone simple fare I'm going to be
really light headed with it i am using
the morphe r2 brush to apply it which
has been my new turret bronzer brush the
past couple of data and loving it I just
get so nervous to try the rozzers
so kids are going to be blocking I'm
going to be great wait wait now this is
applying really really nicely yes get
that pasty-ass forehead wow this is
applying like a high-end bronzer right
now this is really really beautiful okay
so now for blush I just recently
purchased the Oprah blush palette it
looked alike this ton of different color
the only thing I wish it had was it a
really an amazing like Lauren g CT shade
which it doesn't but that is okay I'm
going to go in with
this shade right here in for blush I'm
going to be using the Sigma X 10 so my
girls do anything ok I see it now
it's a nice soft application I'm going
to grab a little bit of this one right
here in the very bottom corner which is
a little bit darker but it's still got
some warmth in it there we go now I see
at that color wasn't really showing up
too much on me
all right so now forehand light Meenu
Anastasia and Nicole Guerrero the
located actually purposes he follow me
on snapchat I just met before I filmed
that literally like I turn on all my
life's until I sat down I was looking in
the viewfinder and I was about to Press
report and my doorbell rang and it was
UPS with this package which was so
excited Oh biggest part of my timings I
have been so excited to try this having
any youtuber be able to collaborate as a
big brand like this is just it's just an
awesome thing I'm really happy I'm
really excited varieties only imagine
how she's feeling right now and I should
get a feel when it launches so I'm so
happy for her
so this is the first time I'm actually
seeing it and for ya BAE Forever Young
is like looking at me like oh oh yeah
initially the kind of looking and I have
its lot Samia but they do look more like
a glittery highlight but I don't think
they're gonna be when I swatch it
because I've seen several people swatch
them on their snapchats and on YouTube
and on my staff does a live literally at
all but these definitely deals a little
glittery looking at them oh no that is
not glittery at all my finger oh honey
today my white hand isn't even like
showing anything this is beautiful huh
swatch eNOS the first to swatch like a
beautiful wet dream oh my god I so did
not mean to say like a wet dream I meant
like they look wet
oh god it caught oh you know how like
everyone wants a highlight I feel like
just look as wetness on their cheek yeah
so we put I desire and the first to look
like that wetness so they're a wet dream
of but daydream definitely their pebbles
oh my god
god I'm a mess but daydream does have a
little bit more of a glitter Sparkle
eNOS to it on my hand at least on my
swatch I got a look at forever lit
that's the super white one oh my god
okay I'm going to go in with below
getter because that's the one that
actually looks the most appealing to me
especially was this look with like the
gold in the warm tones I'm going to
start with that I'm going to use the
morphe n5 x the same brush like always
you for highlighting that is so pretty
if you like them a little bit too light
and skin tone right now no not now this
works it works okay I'm fine
second-guessing myself alright I'm going
to grab a little bit of forever lip oh
girl I'm doing it I'm going in I'm going
to glow up gonna grab a teensy bit just
her right here I guess huh yes I mix the
two together now and do a pinch on my
nose people love to hate on the nose
highlight hate away hate us cuz I'm a do
my thang Cupid's bow
before I do my literally quick I
actually just want to use this sponge to
carve out my bronzer a little bit and
clean it up and just see how this
performs doing that
oh that's all I need press oh girl
if you are a contour girl this fun oh my
god
how I guess morphine hell yes okay these
brows need to be set so I'm going to use
this Charlotte Tilbury legendary brow it
says quick and precise brow definition
gel so it's really really tiny like look
at how little that wand is it is any
vidi so let's see it gets the job done
like no pilot coming out I just feel
like nothing's coming out maybe I'm used
to the NS table you one and like so much
product comes out and it's like Gorilla
Glue this was like this is not what I'm
used to maybe for lick I would be using
the Marc Jacobs liquid lip cream in the
shade of fawn over me which looks like
this like kind of nudie peachy pink
I'm sorry if I keep going out of focus
by the way it's mixed blood moving
forward and backward and when I do that
like I get but you have to be in the
same place when camera in the autofocus
but that's about to change from getting
a new camera and like 72 hour so I
apologize if that's annoying already
nice so the face is B to full capacity
which means that we have reached the end
of the video I've been here for so long
and taking me so long to the Missoula
guy taking so many breaks at one point I
put it on my tweezers and that's like 40
minutes a fine and at the very end just
now with our taking selfies then I wear
my favorite songs came on I have a 30
minute dance party all by myself I'm so
so I ever why I did that but showered
right before I phoned and I'm so sweaty
from dancing so much I did change my lip
color from the last kind of to saw me
because I just didn't like it I love the
formula where are you wearing a Marchesa
the formula the Marc Jacobs liquid lip
cream is beautiful like so cushiony and
so comfortable I wore it for about 40
minutes I was saying but I just did not
mind the color on my skin tone the color
itself is gorgeous I just didn't like it
on my fair skin this is a color that I
would be obsessed with it I had a spray
tan by feel like it was too or this is
it like me so I just swapped out my lip
color really quick and I also
highlighted my brow bone because I was
like there's something missing overall I
have to say I actually kind of look
everything in an entire video what you
know really bothers me because people
are always like you just got everything
you're so fake and every kind of truth
and that's not true I'm actually like
this bitch ever when it comes to makeup
like half the things I try I don't like
like typically if you lay down like five
bronzer I don't know like one of them
and I'm very picky with cosmetics but I
just think that today I got really lucky
everything that I tried our products
that I've been dying to try for a while
so I really love you and picked out bomb
product I think it's pretty much like
everything honestly the on the Charlotte
Tilbury brow gel I don't know if I like
this I mean like I said I did
around out there place 40 minutes no
more like 30 minutes don't be dramatic
um but my brother stole plates I can
still feel the brow gel doing its thing
working its magic up there
it's just that tiny little wand it's
just kind of like it's going to take me
some getting used to but I'm going to
keep trying because you never know
unless from now I might be like screw
that azhagiya brow gel this is my new
rider diet because that's how it happens
see Nicole is Agia bloke it was
beautiful this highlight is still flea
tastic and I am fine with it the
foundation and the powder and the primer
the combination I don't know what is
what I don't know what's doing the magic
but my skin looks the best that it looks
in weeks and that's saying a lot because
I have matte texture right now I've got
a couple little breakouts coming in
right here that comes from I choose just
hormonal crap going on and this is the
best my skin has loads of makeup on in
several weeks and it's frustrating that
I don't really know what's doing what I
want this primer is making a beautiful
the foundation or the powers I use all
three things say for the first time this
color pop rounder they collaborate with
a left right on is amazing this is so
creamy and buttery and blendable I mean
you guys saw on camera like the proof is
in the pudding you watch me blend it out
and it was so worth it I love the color
so much and especially when I go over to
that big near that I have over there and
stand back if you like my full body I'm
like oh my god this barong but I just
love the warmth and honestly the weight
apply it was like a dream anyways I'm
just rambling about all the products I
tried I'm so excited because now I can
finally put all these in my vanity and
use on a daily basis and I cannot wait
like I just love having new things I
know are good like and just getting to
enjoy like new go-to products - so yummy
