makeup tutorial I feel like it's been
such a long time since I've done a
makeup tutorial so I'm really excited
about this um I posted a picture on
Instagram I will insert it here
and also I was wearing that same look in
one of my videos I think it was the last
one or maybe two back I don't know
anyways um I got so many of you asking
me to do this look and at the same time
I also had so many requests asking for a
fall makeup tutorial so I am combining
those two requests into this one video
and when I'm at work and I wear this it
is ridiculous how many women want to
know what colors I am wearing and want
me to do this to their eyes and it's
just it's you know it's simple and it
really flatters every face especially
with the light colors and the way it
kind of smoke salvia it's not really
smoky and it's still like neutral shades
I know it's just it's the perfect fall
tutorial that's not difficult and I
think that anybody can do this look
first thing I'm doing is priming my eyes
and today I'm using Mac's Pro Longwear
concealer a lot of people don't know
this but this concealer is actually also
an eye primer and because of its long
wear and the fact they market it as like
a non creasing concealer it's not
supposed to settle on lines it makes it
so it last all day then I'm taking the
shade Naked Lunch and I'm going to put
this on a flat shader brush all over my
lid area from inner corner all the way
out to outer corner you can take this a
little bit above your crease as well if
you want or you can keep it low it's up
to you but I'm choosing the shade just
because I think it's a nice neutral lid
shade and it just gives a really nice
shiny glowy effect on the lid which is
what I love then I'm going to take Mac's
soft brown as always on a fluffy brush
and I'm going to dust it in my crease as
you can see as always I am just tossing
it in there with no rhyme or reason just
staying mainly on the outer edge I want
the most pigment but you can go in as
far and up as far as you want then after
that I'm going to take texture and on a
217 fluffy brush I'm just going to put
this in my crease I'm going to start it
up on my higher crease as you see I'm
putting it right in the crevice of my
eye and then I'm going to work upward
I'm not taking this down on my lower
crease or lashline area because I'm
going to put another color in there so
just focus this up in the top so you
want that and then soft Brown to be
above the crease and then after that I'm
going to take Mac's Swiss chocolate and
I'm also going to go in with another
color from Maybelline I spoke about this
in a different video but this is one of
their like limited edition fall quads
anyways the maybelline color is awesome
because it's the exact same as Swiss
chocolate
it's just richer so I'm mixing those two
together and I'm just packing it on
underneath of the texture in that outer
corner just all along that lash line and
as you can see with that brush I'm just
fluffing it back and forth and blending
it towards the inner part of my lid to
blend that from the outer corner to the
inner corner so that there's no harsh
lines or anything
working is up into my crease and
texture and if you feel like you need to
get you know more texture and go in then
by all means because you really want
this all just to be blended together
from dark to light in that outer corner
so I'm just working in there and you
want it to be the absolute darkest in
the lowest part of the outer corner of
your eye and then fade up from there on
out so after that I'm going to go in
with brown script and this is just like
a dark rich reddish shade you don't have
to do this step but I'm going to show
you all of the steps that you can take
to get this look because you can stop
there or you can continue going in with
you know reds and oranges which is
really going to give that fall pop of
color so I'm just lightly dusting it in
that area keeping it mainly in the upper
area and then I'm just going over with
this brush no additional product on it
and just blending it out so that there's
no lines I'm going to go in with rule
next I know this seems like a lot of
steps but that's because I'm showing you
a lot of steps and I'm just lightly
dusting that right above all those other
colors that I have on just to blend it
out and give it something other than
just the normal soft brown shade that I
would use now I'm going to just do
eyeliner really quick and I didn't film
myself doing it because I figured it was
pointless I have an eyeliner video so if
you're interested in that I will link it
below for you I'm popping on lashes I'm
using red cherry number 43 they are my
absolute favorite all-time go-to lashes
i order these in bulk from different
websites every time I order like 20 at a
time and it's like $25 for 20 of them so
yeah then after that I am just using a
drugstore L'Oreal mascara to just blend
my natural lashes with my fake ones so
that it looks a bit more natural
speaking of natural I'm going in with
natural radiance um I am NOT a primer
believer except this I am sold if you
have dry skin best primer in the world
you have no idea it is so hydrating it
makes my makeup look so luminous and it
makes it lasts so much longer I am so
impressed for like the first time ever
I'm impressed by a primer it's crazy I
never thought that I would be sold on a
primer my life
anyway so yeah I did my foundation and
I'm filling in my brows and recently
I've had an obsession with having really
thick filled in brows I know that it's
just a phase of mine but I'm really
feeling it right now it's a big trend
and I just I love it and it's yes it's
what I'm doing so get over it now I'm
going in with rice paper on my inner
corner with a little tiny brush and I'm
just going to dab it in my inner
tear-duct to make my eyes pop now make
sure you do that before this next step
where I'm gonna grab texture again and
on just a pencil brush or any brush it
doesn't matter I'm just going to rub it
underneath my eyes and I'm not doing
this precisely at all I'm just putting
it under there with any brush you have
even a q-tip would work and then I'm
going to go in with Swiss chocolate
again I use this up on my crease and I'm
going to use a little bit tighter brush
for this and I'm going to put this right
on my lash line almost as if it's
eyeliner but again as you can see I'm
not being super precise I'm just moving
it around and quick back and forth
motions and just getting in there and
blending it out you can also go back
with a clean brush and just run over or
q-tip to help blend this out because I
don't want it to be like tight in that
lash line I want it to be nice and
feathery I'm using this is the lash
stiletto mascara
it's drugstore once again I'll have it
in the description box for you below and
now I'm going in with Mac's mineralize
skinfinish and shave dark on a big
fluffy brush I'm not actually contouring
because I really want the focus to be on
my eyes I'm just bronzing my cheeks and
doing it under the cheekbones and on the
cheekbones all over nothing special kind
of sloppy but I just want some color on
my face and then I'm going to go in with
copper tone blush this is like my
favorite blush ever for the Fall one of
them in my top five for sure
and I'm just going to dust this up on
the apples of my cheeks back to my
cheekbones and blend it in with that
bronzer and then I'm going to go in with
just a highlighter and this is a a Mac
Pro item and I will list it below it's
called light sweep and if you want to
know why I'm doing this you can watch my
video on how to apply foundation and
blush and I will speak about this more
now I'm going in with a super nude
lipstick this is fairly new it's called
Japanese sequel and it is of course from
Mac um but yeah it's really nude and I
really like it I did end up changing my
lip color later this day it's like a
pinky rosy color but yeah that's it love
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
