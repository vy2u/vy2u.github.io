that hey for today's video I'm going to
be doing a tutorial using the morphe x
kathleen light palette this is such a
cute palette it's nice and small if you
want to throw it in your purse I mean I
personally carry pouch around me but
some people do I know I've seen it so if
you want those in your purse it's a
great little size and I'll show you what
it looks like on the inside I'm sure
you've seen it on social media or if you
follow kathleen but it's super pretty
it's got a nice combination of some
highlighting shades neutrals some warms
a couple of cool tones thrown up in
there which you know what I would like
never touch but I really appreciate that
they are and they're I like to have my
options I always have to support
Kathleen basically no matter what she
does I just think that she is the most
genuine humble down-to-earth sweet kind
she's just she's a doll she's an
all-around peach I just love her so much
she's just so real and honest and I just
I really truly adore her and Jim Meyer
Kathleen she's an awesome girl
so I was so excited to see this
collaboration congratulations Kathleen
this is freaking awesome just like you
so yeah I came up with this look today I
wanted to do something during fallish as
you can't tell don't it look fall I see
a guy you just need like a Starbucks
copy you know just like to complete the
look but then we hold up my Fiji
mmm cold no it doesn't get the same not
the same vibe so anyways I wanted to
create a fall look for you guys as you
can see I went with like a glossy kind
of reddish brown eyo lip which were this
color and then for the eyes I wanted to
do something semi-smoky but I didn't
want it to be like too overboard where
like the average one would watch this
and be like girl bullies get it together
so I did something that's like slightly
smoky I threw a little pop of color on
that lower lash line yes very easy to
achieve I didn't even do winged eyeliner
I know what you're thinking
I have no protection on you today no way
to cut a bitch anyway that did you guys
gonna stop rambling I reserved but you
enjoy this video thank you so much for
watching
Oh last but not least I don't exactly
know the price of this palette but I
know it is very inexpensive and also
discount codes do apply so you can use
anyone's discount code I will put
Kathleen's discount code in the
description box I don't know off the top
of my head but I'll put it down there
for you guys that you can use her code
on her palette so yeah go show her some
of
go show her some support if you guys
love her like I do it's a really cute
palette I'm sure you guys will enjoy it
okay I'm done rambling I love you guys
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you my next video bye
I still eyedrops my eyes so looks like
ice got done crying but I promise I
wasn't remembering ones so first thing
is first I've already primed my eyes I
just used my concealer which is how I've
always prime my eyes personally I set it
with a little bit of powder and now we
are going to jump in with the morphe at
times kathleenlights eyeshadow palette
looks like these right here I'm going to
start off with this shade right here in
the center which let me make sure it's
in focus which just look a nice kind of
warm transition color for the crease so
it's going to pick that up on a fluffy
brush I'm going to begin to put this
directly in the crease area I do on
today's look to be pretty smoky I want
it to be too intense as what I say now
but I can just already like see the
future it's probably gonna look like
raccoon eyes but um I want to make this
too intense so I'm not going to put too
much shadow in the inner corner of the
eye that's always kind of how I dictate
how smokey the eye is going to be if I
want to be really smoky that I put a ton
of shadow in this inner corner of the
eye really hollow that out and that will
make my eye look overall get away more
like blown out smokey effect but what I
want to keep it more of like a mild
smokey eye I usually put the most amount
of pigmentation right here on the outer
corner of my eye all right now I'm going
to pick up my personal favorite color in
this palette I'm sure you already
guessed its this baby Pookie brown shade
right here I'm so obsessed
I remember just a couple years ago if
the only color that looked like this was
Mac Pro Longwear eyeshadow in the shade
interrupted you guys remember that like
if you've been around here for a while
it was like my favorite eyeshadow ever
and now this color is everywhere and I'm
so obsessed with that I'm so glad like
everyone is now putting these shades and
palettes because it's just my favorite
out of it so much pick that baby pukey
Brown up right there and just layer it
right over top that for shade
for the third shade now I'm going to go
in with this color right here I'm not
going to put it as high as those other
shades I'm going to kind of pack it down
here
okay so now before I like deepen up my
crease and let continue to build any
product I'm going to go in with my lip
color I'm going to use this beautiful
golden shade right here and this is one
of the shades in the palette that
Kathleen actually created herself like
she was responsible for the shade so
this is not a morphe shade this is a cat
18 a shade and I'm excited to use
exciton my hand earlier and it looks so
pretty yes love it so I'm going to kinda
put this all over the lid out to the
outer corner and then continue like
blending and you know making my eye look
the way I want it to and then I'll go
back it was a little bit of math fix
plus and just make this gold pop even
more because I love like a very frosty
metallic lid look so now I'm going to go
back with both of these shades kind of
simultaneously and put them in my outer
crease just to get the desired like
smokiness and depth that I'm looking for
and I love that I did my eyes first
instead of my foundation because I can
be so sloppy because all this fallout
can just be wiped up and removed okay so
now I'm going to grab some of the mac
fix+ if you don't fix plus you can use
eye drops it'll work basically just the
same and just spread it on my brush with
that I'm going to dip it back into that
gold shadow and I'm going to apply it
right in that inner corner again just to
get a pop with my makeup I'm kind of
creating a slight slant just to give my
eyes some shape with the eye makeup
there we go and now I can move on to
some eyeliner giving my eyelid are
different today I am NOT going to be
doing a wing one hello so weird but I
started do something a little more
subtle and different and I was thinking
about it like when I was laying in bed
last night and I was like what was my
eyeliner like before I did the wing you
know I'm like trying to think of it I'm
like oh yeah I just like a straight line
whatever happened to that um so crazy to
me I'm like that's ancient history so
I'm just going to do regular eyeliner
straight across the eye today I'm going
to be using a gel liner this is the
morphe gel liner and slate
so these are the glossy makeup by
Natasha Zaki lashes in the style Abu
Dhabi so that's what I'm going to be
using today ah as I cut this last too
short so I have to take this one off and
cut it shorter so they match where a lot
of girls when I meet them in person will
say how badly they wish they could apply
false lashes and I'm telling you I know
it's intimidating I remember exactly
what it was like the first time I
applied my false lashes I remember where
I was standing I remember the lat I read
the entire experience and it's very
intimidating you don't know what the
heck you're doing you feels kinda like a
fish out of water like you don't really
know what angle to do you don't really
know exactly where to like put them but
I'm telling you practice makes perfect
when I first applied my false lashes I
had no one to tell me exactly how to do
it I had no YouTube videos to watch I
just figured it out myself and I'm
telling you if I can do it you can do it
I'm not just like some special wizard
you know like anyone can do it you just
have to practice go to the drugstore get
a cheap pair of false lashes which I
will say that it depends which pair you
get because some false lashes are harder
to apply than others but just go get a
pair that cost like a dollar or two you
know that you're okay with ruining and
just try try with that pair to apply
every night for a couple of days I'm
telling you you will get it down pat
after a couple of times and then you'll
be able to toss it on like right now
this lash is giving me trouble I guess
you can see them kind of struggling with
this normally it's much easier than this
but sometimes it's work sometimes I just
take it off I have to reapply it again
like there's good and bad days you know
so just don't get frustrated with it
just keep trying and I'm telling you
it'll become such an easy thing for me
applying lashes is easier than applying
mascara because it's just foolproof
iger's pop it on it takes a minute and
I'm done
there we go see some washes are
difficult and some are easy that one
literally just took five seconds and
it's good to go
alright so for primer I'm going to use
the LCD pearl radiance primer this is
the my favorite recently it's just clean
okay I'm going to go in with the
hourglass vanish a stick foundation
what's new this is the my favorite
foundation for good month and a half now
at this point I'm going to go ahead and
buff all of that out I am using a
synthetic brush it doesn't matter what
brush you use for your foundation I just
always recommend a synthetic one it is
the absolute best you can usually tell
synthetic hair synthetic hair will look
like this or natural hair will be white
but a lot of times synthetic will just
like this brush right here
oh my skin looks so it just dry just
like recently I don't know what is up
well there's been changing and so does
my skin it's like that every single year
I'm going to use the Tarte shape tape
concealer put a little bit of this light
shade on and then go over it with a
little bit of shade to medium as well
and then with that light shade I'm going
to just put a little arch in Cupid's bow
strike down the nose and then right here
in the center of the forehead this will
bring some definition and in the end
just give you more of like a structured
striking result okay so now I'm going to
set my entire face with powder I'm going
to use the RCM a no color powder this is
a translucent powder I do have it in
like a Sephora container from an old
powder that I wasn't using anymore and I
was going to put it right in the cap
like this and I'm going to I'm running
low I just ordered a new one thank God
because this one is just about done
I'm going to take that exact same dance
sponge and I'm going to dip it directly
into that powder and I'm going to begin
to set my entire face including my under
eye and when you're doing this method
just make sure that your damp sponge is
not super damp like it can't be like
soaking wet because then it'll defeat
the purpose but honestly the results are
just so beautiful and airbrush it is my
number one a favorite way to set my
under eyes to set my face it just makes
your pores look smaller any fine lines
and wrinkles it'll just kind of make
them look much more flawless and smooth
it's now definitely makes me very matte
that's for sure but I'm just I've been
more okay with matte skin because what I
do is I go in and I strategically place
my highlight wherever I want to glow but
I over all have a matte face or that
kind of like because a matte face
definitely hides imperfections more so
let me just go ahead and fill in my
brows really quick I'm gonna use oh my
god this one's totally empty wow thank
God I have a backup and you know I come
prepared I just brushed my eyebrows
straight up and then I fill in on the
very bottom very lightly on the inner
corner and then a little bit more
heavy-handed
as I get to the outer tail okay so now
I'm going to sculpt out my brows with
concealer and I just put a little bit
concealer on the back of my hand like
that and I'm going to use just a definer
brush like this one right here this
specific one is from Sigma it is an e 15
and then I'm only going to sculpt out
the lower part so like what I do is I
like get it like really messy which is
kind of intentional just so that when I
sculpt out it looks super duper smooth
what I do is I just create the line like
that and I'm going to blend that line
out big time so I wipe off my brush and
then I just begin to bring that down
kind of shimmy it downward
and this will also clean up your shadow
a little bit
okay I'm going to grab this first
highlighting shade right a little right
here and the pallets to just highlight
my brow bone area it's falling down all
over my lashes I'm definitely going to
go back in and touch up my liner and my
mascara just to make everything dark
again alright so now for my lower lash
line I'm going to pick up this baby
pukey Brown again I'm just going to dip
a pencil brush right in there and run it
all along my lower lash line gosh I love
this color so much okay so I'm going to
go in with this dark green right here
it's got shimmer in it because this is
something that I would like never do so
I'm going to go ahead and pick this up
and put it on my lower lash line with a
much smaller more precise brush to
really deepen this oh yeah it's very
pretty
ah I got someone shot on my eye for the
other eye I'm going to use a another
definer brush just like this and I'm
going to use that to pack on the green
because I had some fallout and I don't
want to do that again life is about
learning from your mistakes right much
better okay I'm going to take that
highlighting shape in the palette I'm
going to pop that in the inner corner of
my eye I'm going to go ahead and bronze
my face I'm going to use some Mac give
me sons I really want to have like a
warm bronze look to complement this eye
shadow that I have going on the only
issue is I don't have the proper brush
that I would like to normally use to
apply this so I'm going to using this
one I like to use this more for contour
it's the morphe m53 own I'm just going
to go ahead and bronze up my entire
cheek area like use it as if it's a
blush almost and put it all around the
outer perimeter of my face
all right so I'm going to go in with
this new Mac this is their Holiday
Collection they sent it out in PR no so
excited when I saw this it's called the
nutcracker suite' copper face compact so
just the name of it on my copper face
compact and it comes with a blush and a
highlighter duo and a highlighter is
whisper of guilt which if you don't know
is basically like the first highlighter
that slayed the game as far as like this
really pretty golden kind of like wet
looking highlighter is concerned so I'm
so excited they brought this back I'm
going to use this blush on my cheeks
today it's really pretty coppery warm
blush I love the texture of it and then
for highlight I actually wish that I had
Kathleen and makeup geeks highlighter
palace I could use her highlighting
palette as well with her eye palette but
I left it at home so I'm going to use
the whisper of guilt that comes in this
compact as well oh girl
gosh it's so pretty
we've got texture again on the side of
my face I don't know what it is right
side of my face always gets texture
Cupid's bow tip of the nose okay I'm
going to just put some mascara on my
lower lashes really quick okay I'm going
to set my crazy-ass brows it was some
brow gel lock those down I'm going to
use this Anastasio gloss in the shade
fudge because that just looks so pretty
and I want to do a glossy lip today
instead of a matte one so let's see this
color mm-hmm okay eyes really quickly
want to put some white eye liner on the
inner room my eyes I just feel like
something is missing and I want it to
pop more so I'm just going to go ahead
and use some fascinating I coal by Mac
okay so now that we have done that I'm
going to just set my face with some make
it forever emissive mix and just give a
couple small gentle sprays I want to get
it to soaked and dewy and then we'll be
done I am over vein this looks is so
fall yeah baby
let's make it more like the average
smokey how does that even mean oh I
we're still recording done embarrassing
ourselves but today I'm moving on girl
you know I'm in sweatpants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
