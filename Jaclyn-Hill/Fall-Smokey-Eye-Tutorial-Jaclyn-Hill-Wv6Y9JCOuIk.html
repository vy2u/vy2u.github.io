quick makeup look for you this is a very
fall appropriate smokey eye I used to
wear this look all the time back in the
day when I worked at the MAC store
Woodfield Mall and without fail every
single time I wear this look the
eyeshadows would just sell off the
shelves because it is such a pretty look
and it lists on everybody all eye colors
all skin tone it's so fall appropriate
and it's colorful shades that look
really smoky and deep on anybody so it
is just such a pretty look so I thought
I would show you guys how to do it since
I always go back to this look every
single fall because I just love it so
much so I really hope you guys enjoy
this video and I will see you soon bye
so at this point I have been tweezing my
eyebrows for oh I don't know the past 15
20 minutes since I have sensitive skin
my eye area is really red so I'm
definitely going to be using my mac
prolongwear concealer to go in conceal
all that redness and help prime the eyes
for the eye shadow that we will be using
first eyeshadow I'm using is makeup geek
Peach Smoothie this is such a pretty
peachy undertone but neutral shade to
use I'm going in with a sigma e-40
blending brush and I'm just going to
buff this all the way from inner corner
to outer corner back and forth using
windshield wiper motions I'm getting on
quite a good amount of this pigment just
because this is a smoky eye so don't be
afraid to really go in and get that
color on then I'm using Mac red brick
I'm going to go in with a sigma e25 for
this one which is just a white-haired
brush that's similar to the one we use
before it's just a little bit more dense
and going to get it on a little bit
heavier so I'm going in the lower crease
just blending back and forth right in
that crease area and slightly blending
upward then I'm using Mac sketch this is
a really pretty deep line shade it's
like a dark purple it basically is like
the color of wine to me so I'm going to
be using an e 55 and I'm just packing
this all over the lid once we get up to
that crease area you're going to want to
be a little bit more light handed it
will look a little choppy but that is
okay working with matte shades that are
this dark all over the lid it's going to
tend to look choppy but I'm going to
show you all the things that we can do
so that it's not choppy in the end then
I'm going in with Mac copper ring yay
from Mac shades today right are you guys
proud of me and I do not typically use
shimmer colors in my crease but I'm
going to do so today just because it
really helps make this look pop and just
takes it to a different place and on top
of it it will make your blending
experience a lot easier as we go forward
in this so just windshield wiper motions
back and forth again then I'm gonna go
in with Mac rule I know that there are a
lot of steps in this but I'm just
showing you guys of what all steps you
can take to really make this look
flawless so we're just going to blend
that back and forth again everything is
going all the way from inner corner to
outer corner in this look because we
really wanted to be that classic
blown-out smokey eye so I'm just going
back with a little bit more sketch just
to deepen it up because as you can see
it kind of fades away since we have a
matte shade all over the crease and
we're messing a lot with our upper
crease you got it so I'm going to use
thirty nine brush by sigma i absolutely
love this brush it did come out and one
of their new kits it came out in the
perfect blend kit I believe it's called
it's on my blog I love this brush so as
you can see I'm just going back and
forth again all the way from inner
corner of the eye to outer corner just
be patient with it and work work work
and it will end up completely being
blended out then I just go back with a
tiny bit more of red brick or rule
whatever you want just to ensure that
it's completely done and blended all
together I did put on liner and lashes I
do have a video for liner and I do have
a video for lashes so I will link that
below I didn't think it was necessary to
show in this look you can see lashes
really takes it to the next level so
then we're going to go in and we're
going to highlight underneath the brow
bone this is very important and it look
like this where you're working with such
dark dramatic colors just because this
is going to bring a nice positive
attention to the eye and really increase
the height of the brow just to make
everything look more put together so I
really recommend highlighting that under
eye brow and then I'm going to go in
with Laura Mercier moisture supreme
foundation I have not used this
foundation so long so I figured why not
I used to love it I will say that
throughout the night it did not wear as
well as I wanted it to and as well as
the other ones I've been using recently
but I do really like the way it looks
especially for someone with dry skin
then I'm going in with Mac prep and
prime and this is in light boost it's
the yellow base one as opposed to the
pink one as you can tell I'm not going
to put it directly under my eye area
because I don't really want to put this
color directly underneath my eye area
because it can kind of make you look
sick so I am using an nw20 and Mac Pro
Longwear concealer underneath my eye
area which is more of a pinky beige tone
and then with these yellowy tones it's
just going to kind of counteract each
other to make a really beautiful neutral
shade and basically I'm doing this
really intensely just because it's going
to add just more dramatization to the
face with those eyes because if you
don't conceal underneath the eyes and
highlight the face you can sometimes
look a little undone or maybe
sick in a way with those really dark
dramatic eyes if you guys want to see an
in-depth like highlighting and
contouring cream
video using all cream products like I am
right now I can definitely show you how
to do that it's really easy and it'll
just pull a really smoky look like this
together don't you love my open mouth
like
close your mouth Jacqueline then I'm
going to set my under eye concealer as
always I'm using Mac Pro and emphasize
it's just a stark white powder and I'm
going to run it along the under-eye area
to set the concealer the top lip of the
Cupid's bow in between the eyebrows in
the forehead down the nose just the
areas that we always tend to highlight
just so that nothing moves around since
it's all liquid then I'm going to go in
with Anastasia brow Wiz this is in the
shade soft brown I'm gonna keep my brows
on the little less dramatic side for
those of you who don't fill in your
brows your public really Jacqueline
really that's not dramatic but compared
to how I used to fill in my brows back
in the day this is actually extremely
natural for me believe it or not so I'm
just gonna fill them and buff it out a
little bit I'm not gonna do any
sculpting or shaping to make them look
over-the-top then I'm going to go in
with sketch underneath the eye area with
a more defined brush and I'm starting
from outer corner and moving it to the
inner corner you want this to be the
darkest in the outer corner and a little
bit lighter in the inner corner if you
want to make it all extremely dark
that's all on you but that's how I'm
doing it then with a pencil brush I put
a little bit more red brick on that
brush and I'm just going to blend that
out so that you don't have like a harsh
purple liner there you want this to be
blended and once again it'll just tie
the upper lid with the lower then I
think this is like the most important
part especially the under eye area is to
line your waterline with black liner I'm
using the Inglot gel liner in black it's
the same one I use on my upper lid and
then I'm going to go back with that same
brush and just blend it out as you can
see it brings so much more attention to
your eye color your eye shape and your
look overall so you can see with that
black liner and that highlight under the
brow how it really all works together as
a team just to make it such a pretty
smokey eye that's why there are so many
steps involved because it just makes it
look prettier I'm sorry don't hate me
then I'm just putting a coat of mascara
on I'm using any mascara it really
doesn't matter it's your lower lashes
just get some mascara on then I'm going
to contour I do have an in-depth video
of how I contour so I will list that
below as well as the eyeliner and the
lashes
I am using hoola bronzer just because I
figured in this lighting while I'm
staying at my mom's it was going to look
orange if I use the other one I've been
using so I use hoola and I am using the
NARS I
brush or ITA brush someone show how to
pronounce that and just sculpting out
the face quickly and I'm using a Marc
Jacobs foundation brush to actually just
blend out the rest of it just to make it
smooth so that we don't have any harsh
lines then I'm going to go in with Mac
blush in margin this is a beautiful
shade of talked about it for a long time
I used to sell it like hotcakes when I
worked at Mac it has a really gorgeous
shimmer in it basically literally looks
good on everybody from very fair to very
very dark so it's just going to really
help since it's a neutral shade it's
nothing to cry cry then I'm gonna go in
with the Smashbox masterclass 2 palette
and grab that highlighting color called
shimmer thank you so much to all of you
who told me that this is sold
individually at Sephora so I will be
going and getting one of those for
myself since it's much more travel
friendly and I'm just highlighting the
areas of my face that need highlighting
then I'm going to use Mac flair for
finery lipstick which I talked about in
my October favorites and I'm going to go
in with Marc Jacobs studded kiss you can
see what a beautiful new color this
makes because I really don't like those
really pale pale nude lips so this is
very complementary to our eye colors so
I really hope you enjoy this video you
guys I love you forever and I'll see you
soon bye Oh
this is a very small small I'm gonna say
smoky and fall so there is false world
hey guys so I'm like hey guys
time I wear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
