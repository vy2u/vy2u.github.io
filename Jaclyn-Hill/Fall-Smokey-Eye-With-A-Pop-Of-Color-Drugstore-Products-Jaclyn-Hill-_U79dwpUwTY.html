so today so today I'm going to be doing
a makeup tutorial on the look that I'm
wearing right now of course I was very
inspired by fall to do this makeup look
and I wanted to do something really
different and outside the box with a pop
of color using mainly drugstore products
because I feel like any time I use a lot
of drugstore products it's very natural
neutral everyday basic bitch type stuff
I wanted to do something fun and
colorful and just smokey with a pop of
color it's going to be really fun and
fall appropriate something you can wear
on a night out but it's still drugstore
so for those of you who have been
requesting more drugstore products this
toriel is for you so I really hope that
you enjoy this look I personally love
love love it actually to go wash it off
though because a couple days ago my best
friend who owns a mobile spray tanning
company
she was trying out a new tank solution
on me before she used on her clients and
I was like show my mom dad for anything
and I was her guinea pig and my skin had
a horrible reaction to it I'm just so
over sensitive my skin literally like
this whole beard area it's just like
alligator skin I have to wake up like
three times mill the night and like rub
lotion because it's just burns and
itches and literally feels like it's
gonna crack off it hurts so bad it's so
weird never experienced anything like it
before it's misery so as soon as I
started applying my foundation I was
like ow and I think my face is melting
off which is why my hair is not done
which is why I'm rushing through all
this because I'm about to go wash my
face and then go to movies with my mom
with no makeup on so thank you so much
for watching this video you guys I love
you so much
I've seen a couple days hi alright peeps
let's do this so my eyes are already
primed and the first thing I'm going to
do is go in with a morphe eyes shadow oh
I'm going to be using the color number
13 this is a great neutral transition
color for the crease area I'm using a
fluffy brush from Sigma this is the e-40
just to dust this in that entire upper
crease area from inner to outer corner
then I'm going to go in with L'Oreal
smoldering plum I'm going to take a Mac
252 brush any flat brush that you have
that really packs on color is going to
do because you do not have to be precise
with this I'm going to just smudge this
all over the entire lid but I'm not
going to pass my crease you'll see once
I get to my crease area I'm just going
to take that brush and kind of dig and
carve out that
back and forth and it's very messy so
don't really worry about being precise
then I'm going to go in with NYX
eyeshadow in the shade
so cute I love that him using the exact
same a 40 brush I'm going to just dust
that color and the entire crease just
like we did with morphe number 13 this
is really going to warm up that purple
area and it's also going to complement
the purple eye shadow and the green eye
shadow that we're going to be applying
later then I'm going to go in with
another morphe eye shadow and this is in
the shade 71 this to me is a mix between
makeup geek bitten and mac cosmetics
sketch it's gorgeous
so now using an e25 from Sigma I'm going
to just buff that in the entire crease
area it's such a gorgeous wine color and
you'll see how putting that in between
the smoldering plum and in-between the
LOL really is just that perfect
middleman to tie those two colors
together and this just makes it so easy
to blend everything out so you don't
have to worry about blending out that
original color smoldering plum all over
that lid it's foolproof
see I have to do my happy dance because
I'm loving life right now then taking a
completely clean blending brush I'm
going to go over that entire crease area
to finish out the blending process this
will just make sure that you have no
harsh lines and everything is buffed out
smoothly then I'm going to go in with my
favorite eyeliner ever this is
Maybelline eye studio gel liner and I'm
using the shade blackest black using an
angled eyeliner brush I'm going to trace
out the wing that I'm going to be doing
and I'm going to fill it in today I'm
only going to be doing a 1/2 wing
meaning I'm only going to focus on focus
on the outer corner of the eye and I'm
going to stop it in the center of the
lid doing this will give you that cat
eye effect without going overboard on
eyeliner and sometimes taking away from
the shadow now I'm going to be taking a
q-tip and an eye cream and just cleaning
up that under eye area and tracing along
that liner making the goofiest face of
life to make sure all the fallout has
been cleaned up and it'll make
everything much more precise and sharp
as you can see then I'm going to go in
with lashes I'm going to be using our
Dell wispy lashes these are very popular
from the drugstore but first I always
mascara because I don't like putting
mascara on my false lashes because
sometimes it can kind of dull them down
and make them look even more fake than
they already need to be so moving on to
foundation I am going to be using
L'Oreal magic loonie this is a beautiful
foundation oh not on alligator skin
though this is basically the luminous
version
of the original L'Oreal True Match so
for the girls out there who have dry
skin this will be a great foundation for
you I'm buffing it on with a makeup geek
foundation stippling brush and then I'm
going to go and fill in my eyebrows I am
using Anastasia brow Wiz as always to
fill in my brows today and my camera
died and I didn't realize so you're just
gonna pretty much get in the end and
here it comes boom sowee
those are my finished brows they're a
little bit bolder than I would like them
to be but I went a little heavy-handed
this day I was like hurry get this
makeup on I am highlighting my brow bone
with Mac shroom it's one of my favorite
highlighters ever and when I do a smoky
eye it is an absolute must must must for
me to highlight my brow bone and blend
it down to just pull that look together
then I'm going to go in with Maybelline
fit me concealer this is a pretty sheer
concealer and since I'm going to be
using a blending I'm sorry a beauty
blender I am going to put on a generous
amount because using a damp Beauty
Blender really helps soak up a lot of
product and really hydrate the skin at
the same time so it does pull away some
of the product that you initially put on
so even though it looks like it's a lot
it's really not that much since you are
using a damp Beauty Blender to buff that
out so that's all I'm doing is buffing
out that entire under-eye area in a V
motion up towards the temples then to
even it out I'm going to put a little
bit on my chin and then a generous
amount on my forehead and slightly bring
it down in between the eyebrows doing
this is just going to even out that
under-eye highlight as you can tell it's
just a little bit lighter than my
foundation and if you just put it under
the eye sometimes it can look a little
unbalanced doing this will just pull
that whole thing together and give that
highlight a beautiful glow being evenly
distributed throughout the face then I'm
going to go in with my Anastasia banana
powder and set my under eyes like I said
there's a few things I can't live
without like my setting powder my
eyebrows and my eyebrow highlight those
are like the three things that are non
drugstore that I just I have to have in
my life then I'm going to be going in
with another L'Oreal eyeshadow in the
shade golden emerald using a flat
definer brush this is an e 15 by Sigma
you guys you don't even know the
obsession with the shadow it is so
gorgeous oh my god it is so beautiful
for fall like the whole time I'm putting
it on a mic on my god oh my god oh my
god oh my god it's beautiful
so I'm going to put this on that entire
under eye area and then when I get to
the outer corner what I'm going to do is
extend
at all the way to have it match my wings
liner
typically I stop it right at the end of
the eye but today I'm going to bring it
all the way out to the tail of that
liner because that's again going to give
us more of a dramatic effect and a cat
eye then using a makeup geek brush I'm
going to just blend that entire area so
that it's nice and buffed out and then
I'm taking a little bit more of shroom
and just dabbing it on the inner corner
of the eye to give a little bit of a pop
highlighting the inner corner in the
brow and doing a smoky eye always gives
it a really bombshell look now I'm going
to be using Jane bronzer in the shade
inspire which is not much darker than my
skin which gives a really nice natural
bronze effect natural one and my natural
and I'm going to just be sculpting out
that cheekbone area lightly using a
makeup geek brush that I will link down
below for you guys and then I was going
to put that on the forehead and the
temple area just to even that all out
then I'm going to be using hard candy
Tiki to highlight my face this is such a
beautiful highlighter from the drugstore
and using a morphe fan brush I'm just
going to apply that at the very tops of
my cheekbones then I'm going to be going
in with NYX blush in the shade
bittersweet oh my gosh this blush is so
pretty it's just a beautiful Brown rosy
Mavi color it's perfect for fall it's
such a great high quality product for
such a low price then I'm going to be
just putting a sheer coat of mascara on
the lower lashes nothing too heavy
otherwise it can take away from that
lower lash line pop of color that we
have then to finish off this look I'm
going to go in with L'Oreal lipstick in
the shade nude cream which is one of my
favorite nude lipsticks of all time from
the drugstore so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching I love you and I'll see you
soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
