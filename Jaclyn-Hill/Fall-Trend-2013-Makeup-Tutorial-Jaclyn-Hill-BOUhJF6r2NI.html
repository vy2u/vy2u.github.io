today I'm going to be doing a makeup
tutorial for you this look is based off
of a huge trend for they fall of 2013
which is the berry wine colored lip
basically every brand is coming out
either a lipstick stain gloss around
this color it's a huge thing coming into
the fall and I figured this would be the
perfect way to kick off fall makeup
trends because I love the trends this
season I think they're my favorite
trends I have seen for the past four or
five years so I'm super super excited to
be doing lots of makeup tutorials for
the fall trends so as always this is
going to look good on all I colors it's
going to look good on all skin tones
everybody can rock this look of course
you can simplify it but I always do the
entire show from A to Z in case you guys
want to know exactly what to do but
don't forget that if you don't do this
whole thing you can still be on trend
you can definitely simplify it so with
that being said I really hope you guys
enjoy my tutorial and I will see you
next time bye oh wait you are always
asking me about my hair so I have to
start getting better at this I curled my
hair today with the Titan 3 by new me I
of course have a discount code otherwise
I'm gonna be talking about it it will be
down at my description bar so you guys
can go ahead and get 110 dollars off
that's right
I am starting off with a fresh clean
face and first thing I'm doing is
priming my eyelids I'm using Mac Pro
Longwear concealer in nw20 I have talked
about millions of times how much I love
this concealer for priming the eyes I'm
using it in shade NW 20 which is a
little bit lighter than my natural skin
tone as you can see and this will just
make it so that the pigment and shadow
stand out more against my eyelid I'm
gonna pin back my hair so that I'm not
irritating you the entire video and I'm
going in with first makeup geek Peach
Smoothie eyeshadow this is an amazing
dupe for maximo a silk I am using a
sigma e40 brush which is just a big fat
synthetic brush just to buff this into
the eye area as you can see I first
touch it on the outer crease of my eye
and then I'm gonna blend it back and
forth and windshield wiper motions going
all the way into that inner corner the
less products you have on the brush the
more you can start working up towards
your brow to make sure that it's
seamless and you'll have any of harsh
lines or cutoff points then I'm gonna go
in with another makeup geek product and
this is creme brulee again I'm going to
push this right in that outer corner a
little bit lower than I did with the
Peach Smoothie and then blending it all
the way into the inner corner once again
I always start in the outer corner
because that's where I generally like it
to be darkest because it will give a
very small illusion of a cat eye then
I'm going to use makeup geek pigment and
nightlife this is from the new fall
collection that I was raving about in my
last favorites video it's this beautiful
taupe shade it's so Universal it's got a
little bit of purple in it a little bit
of silver in it and I started off using
the mac 242 brush and then I realized I
was getting so much fallout that I
switched to the sigma e55 I used to love
Mac 242 and then once I discovered the
e55 brush it's just like by this is so
much better it packs on the pigment so
densely I barely get any fallout when
using this brush I just love it so much
I have nothing bad to say about this
brush and then once I get to the crease
area I turn my brush sideways just to
gently blend but you don't want to take
this pigment any higher than the crease
otherwise it can start to look a little
messy
then using a blending brush this is a
GoAir blending brush which usually
that's what white brushes mean which is
not going to pack on as much color as a
black brush and
you have a tiny bit of more creme brulee
and just buffing that out once again so
we have that nice seamless smoky effect
with no harsh lines whatsoever then I'm
gonna use mac fix+ which is a setting
spray and I'm going to spray it on the
brush with that pigment on it and just
dab it right in the center of my lid as
you can see this is going to give us a
little pop of metallic right in the
center of the eye which will bring more
attention to the eyes and give it a nice
glossy kind of glittery shimmery effect
I'm using Maybelline eye studio gel
liner and this is in the shade blackest
black and I'm just going to use any
eyeliner angled brush you have and I'm
going to just go ahead and rub this all
over the top of my lashes I'm gonna go
back and forth because when I go back
and forth I think it really blends it
out instead of getting a huge amount of
product and just going in with one swipe
I think it makes it a lot prettier then
I'm gonna go in with L'Oreal voluminous
mascara and I'm going to just go ahead
and coat my lashes I'm not curling them
or trying to make them look pretty I'm
just simply getting some mascara on them
just so they're black and not covered an
eye shadow then I'm going to pop on some
lashes these are the lower lashes and
strike a pose you know I use these
lashes all the time they do last
literally 20 to 25 times and uses so I
just keep using them over and over and
over and over and then after I get those
on nice and tight I'm gonna go over that
lash line with the balm Schwing
eyeliner it's a super super jet black
eyeliner as you can see and it dries to
a matte finish which is very important
to me cuz I don't like shiny eyeliners
then I'm going to prime my face with
urban decay brightening and tightening
complexion primer potion ooh that was a
mouthful sorry I got an email I have not
noticed anything great about this primer
but I do own it so I'm going to get my
use out of it then I'm using giorgio
armani luminous silk foundation and i'm
going to use a flat top kabuki brush
this one is by sigma are you surprised
and I'm just gonna buff this all over my
face I love flat top kabuki brushes that
are synthetic they work on every skin
texture and the skin type is just it
makes it look the most airbrush I think
that you can possibly get and of course
covering up my little blemish and then
I'm going to use Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and
w25 instead a 20 this is the same color
as the rest of my face pretty much and
I'm gonna use this under my eye just
because I don't want to do a super
highlighted effect because highlighting
and contouring to the extreme is not
really in this fall and I'm basing this
tutorial around fall trends so therefore
I'm using MW 25 instead this brush was
in my favorite video and I already
forgot the name of it and I'll list it
below then I'm using bare minerals
original foundation this is the luminous
one that has a really pretty glow in it
and then I'm going to use the Tarte
foundation kabuki brush I believe that's
what it is and it's a super dense brush
I'm gonna pack this on the t-zone area I
don't put it above my top lip because
when I do that I think that it actually
breaks up that foundation quicker
throughout the day I never powder my top
lip and then I am so sorry I'm getting
so many emails right now you guys then
I'm going to go in with Anastasia brow
Wiz and soft brown and I'm going to just
trace my entire eyebrow making the outer
tail darker than the inner corner and
then using the spoolie to just brush it
out I'm gonna highlight my brow with Mac
shroom this is my Holy Grail brow
highlighter i use this on anyone who has
a skin tone your mind and again i'm
using a sigma e40 brush just to
highlight underneath of that route area
I'm now using hourglass ambient lighting
powder this is in diffuse light I'm
going to use a tapered highlighting
brush and just dust this under my eye
area up towards the temple down by the
sides of the nose for a soft gentle
highlight then I'm using benefit hoola
bronzer such a great bronzer this is
such a universal shade I talked about it
more in depth in my contour video that I
will leave below on how I contour myself
and my clients but here you're gonna get
the quick version and I am just going in
contouring and then buffing it out once
again I'm not doing a super intense
contour I'm buffing it out a lot because
this fall you see a lot of the bronzer
action not happening so intense and
strikingly as we did see last season so
I figured I would do it this way since
it is a trend video then I'm using
benefit rocket or blush this is a rose
gold blush by Benefit they just came out
with
in the last month or so it is very very
beautiful I will say that the blending
power is not as great as I wish it was
but that's okay it's still pretty I
think the color is amazing then I'm
going to use josie maran argan
illuminating powder i talked about this
in my video as well my favourites so you
can see the shade here it's such a
pretty universal shade like I said it's
a beige it's not too pink or silver then
I'm going to use a matte black eyeshadow
this one is again by makeup geek I do
not realize that I was doing an entire
makeup look with makeup deep products
but a lot of you have asked for that so
you're welcome and then I'm going to
just take a pencil brush and buff that
out using creme brulee once again just
going back and forth I'd get that black
in there nice and densely and then I go
over it with a light color like creme
brulee just to make it again seamless
and then I go in with Coco bear which is
again by makeup geek I'm going to buff
that out again just to give it a little
bit more depth but I do the creme brulee
first that way this is seamless as you
can see it just looks very blown out
there is nothing harsh about it then
using again the same L'Oreal voluminous
mascara I'm just going to coat my bottom
lashes so that they're not white or
colored and shout out even if you have
tiny lashes that's important I'm going
to use Mac burgundy lip pencil you can
see I spend this up and that tattooed
man running by was my husband it wasn't
a ghost I'm just going to coat my entire
lips in this I do have a lip balm on so
it's going on nice and sheer which is
what I want then I'm going to use urban
decay lipstick and shame any berry color
that you have will work I'm using this
one because it's a newer lipstick that I
own because I love the formula of these
and I'm going to coat my entire mouth in
this I'm not gonna go too high up over
my liner though I'm mainly keeping this
in the center of my lips then using a
brush I will buff this out so you get a
very mild ombre effect where it's darker
in the center and lighter on the outside
which is again a very big trend right
now I'm gonna use Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray and I use a hefty
amount just to set everything so we
ensure that it does not move keeps you
nice and hydrated I hope you guys
enjoyed this I love you so much and I'll
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
