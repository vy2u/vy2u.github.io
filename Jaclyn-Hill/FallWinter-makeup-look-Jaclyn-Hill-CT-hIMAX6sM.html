of my absolute favorites it's a deep
dark like vampy lip with neutral kind of
fair skin with a lot of highlight and
contour the eyes are kept really neutral
the eyebrows are much more bold and
normal um I've been seeing this all over
the runways for the past couple of
months and this is actually still going
to continue to be a trend in spring of
2012 which is really fun I know a lot of
people are really scared to try a deep
dark lip like this but once you just
force yourself to break out of your
comfort zone I feel like everybody can
wear this it's really beautiful
it complements your skin tone if you
have blemishes and things that you want
to hide and you wear a deep dark lip
like this it'll bring more attention to
the lips and help not focus so much on
the face so I think it's a gorgeous look
and it will look gorgeous on everybody
so if you want to know how I did it
thank you for watching hi guys okay so
the first thing I'm doing is taking a
concealer and this is select cover-up by
MAC Cosmetics and it's a good shade
lighter than the rest of my skin tone
and that's going to help with our
highlighting and contouring purposes I'm
using my fingers to apply it because the
warmth from my fingers is going to
emulsify it and help blend it and I'm
going to actually take it up into my
eyebrow as well that way the shadow that
we use on there will really stay so
since we use a creamy concealer I just
lightly took a brush going over that
with a light powder that way I could
just keep it in place and none of this
is going to run and now I'm using
smolder eye pencil by Mac which is a
Kohl liner and I'm just dabbing it along
my lash line kind of tight lining it not
actually making a line as you can see
because we're gonna go back in with a
brush and kind of smooth it out to give
it a really airy fluffy flowy effect I'm
taking a small eyeliner brush which is
the number 208 by Mac and I'm just
running it tightly against
my lashline as you can see I'm pulling
my eyelid tot just so that I can stay
really low and not spread this up too
high because this really isn't going to
be a smokey eye we're going to try to
keep it neutral so just try to keep that
color far down as possible now I'm
taking the color shroom on a flat shader
brush and putting it on the high point
of my brow bone I personally like to do
this before I go in with my brow color
and shape them now you want to take a
neutral Brown not too warm and not too
cool with a fluffy brush I'm using the
224 and you just want to lightly dust it
throughout your entire crease this color
won't really show but give a little
dimension I'm taking that same shroom
color on that same flat shader brush
that I use under my brow and just
dabbing it in my inner corners for a
little pop of highlight and this will
really show up when the look is
completely finished now I'm taking that
same concealer that I used before and
shade nw15 and I'm spreading it under my
eye area and I'm doing a v-shaped down
my nose to the outer corner of my eye
and I'm using this in a lighter color
because that v-shape is really going to
give a pretty highlight once we get that
bronzer on our cheekbones and just
continue to blend and to avoid creasing
throughout the day work from the outer
corner and dab in and then we'll set
with a light powder and you won't be
creasing at all I'm applying a medium
coverage foundation now with this soft
synthetic kabuki brush by Sigma I prefer
to use this brush over my fingers
because it spreads the foundation so
beautifully on my face now I'm taking a
very light powder on a soft fluffy brush
and going in that V motion again just to
give a nice highlight and dimension now
take that same eyeliner brushes before
with that leftover smolder Kohl pencil
on it and lightly smudge out on your
bottom lash line just right at the base
of them
to twelve brush by Mac to fill in my
brows with the shade cork which is by
Mac and on the outer wing I am going to
use an even darker shade to give more
thickness and drama
now I'm just going to throw on a pair of
false eyelashes I chose some really long
wispy ones for a flirty girly effect I'm
taking some black mascara and putting it
right at the root of my lashes this will
help blend my natural lashes and my
false ones together
I'm taking that 208 brush again and I
put some smolder eye pencil on it and
I'm going to go over my false lash line
to keep that liner there and hide the
glue I'm taking a duo fiber brush and
highlighting the tops of my cheekbones
with the eye shadow color and nylon take
that same shade and put it on your
Cupid's bow and down the center of your
nose now pack on that bronzer bitch I'm
taking the shade peaches by Mac and it's
a matte finish now make your fishy face
and put it on the lower portion of your
cheekbones and blend it up into your
bronzer now I'm taking the famous orgasm
blush by NARS I'm just going to dab it
on the apples of my cheeks to give a
beautiful glow over top of that peaches
I line my lips with burgundy lip pencil
by Mac then went over it with diva
lipstick which is a matte finish and now
I'm going back with that lip pencil just
to touch up the edges
All Right girls you're all finished have
fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
