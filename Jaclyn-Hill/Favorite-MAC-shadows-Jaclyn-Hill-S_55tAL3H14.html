doing a what's know it's like my
favorite eyeshadow is from math these
are my palettes right here from Mac and
I'm going to be going through them and
just telling you my personal favorite
eye shadows now I've had a couple of you
request this and ask me me and I quote
can you please do a video telling us
your favorite Mac shadows so I'm going
to do it I was a little confused because
I was like should I do my favorite
eyeshadows or should I do like you know
what I believe our essential eyes shadow
I wasn't I was coming I was a little
confused because kind of like my
favorites my uncle your favorites and
that's kind of boring like why am I
gonna sit here and tell you like oh this
is my favorite looks fabulous on me and
you're like hello bitch I'm black but
anyways I'm gonna do for you anyway
because some of you obviously want to
know what my personal favorite eye
shadows are and I guess I'll say I'm
flattered you know cool you want to know
I'll tell you I'm gonna start off with
my neutral palette right here
umm yes there's like a little guy
missing because for some reason I have
this weird thing where like I don't want
to fill it up so I have like possums dry
shadows but like I refuse to put in
there for some reason cuz I'm like oh it
looks like because there's like one left
I have room I don't know I'm so weird
one of the most important colors I think
everybody should have is an all over a
shimmery color for the lid and all that
glitters is my favorite one every single
person that would come in to Mac used to
ask for Naked Lunch naked my second
lunch
that's Naked Lunch you can't really see
them at that great like okay but that's
Naked Lunch
and that's all that glitters they're
similar but all that glitters is just a
little bit darker and a little more gold
based Naked Lunch is just like pinky and
people come in like oh I need to refill
my Naked Lunch and I would be like oh
try all that glitters and they would be
like oh my gosh I could never heard of
this before it's on the overflow tray
it's not on the main um rack of
eyeshadows in Mac it's like right next
to it there's a little tray with like 15
eyeshadows on it it's right there and
that is my all-time favorite all-over
color so here's all the glares you can
see right on my finger
haha I'm totally joking but seriously
here's all the glares see right there
it's like a neutral with a little bit of
gold sorry I have like a swatch from
earlier not put naked lunch to it so you
can see the difference Naked Lunch is
just pinkier don't mind my nails they're
chipping away okay so they're so similar
but as you can see I can see the
difference it's a little bit Goldy
anyways all that glitters all the way
amazeballs for highlight shroom is my
absolute absolute favorite this is like
really embarrassing because mine is
completely hit the pan I'm like working
around the edge but I have a backup but
whatever okay so shroom is right there
can you even see that whatever it's just
the most true highlight shade that I
think Mac has it's not too pink it's not
too yellow there's no goal it's just
sheer perfect highlight so shroom is my
favorite for anybody that's like around
my skintone you know a few shades
lighter if you shouldn't darker that's
what I tend to use if you're really
light I would use nylon or even vanilla
pigment see here I am eyes like I can't
help it I can't just talk about my
favorites I have to like
give advice and tell you I think is
going to work for you that's why this
video is so hard okay
Browns this is like the main Browns okay
so obviously soft brown soft brown I put
my crease to blend out any color I'm
working with whether it's blue pink
purple whatever it is but if I'm
blending out anything warm like a warm
tone Brown or reds or oranges or yellows
I use Lois silk so here soft brown and
here's Samoa silk Samoa sill is more
yellow
obviously soft Brown is more of a pinky
Brown I won this a lot of times with
soft brown though to make like a perfect
blending out Shae because sometimes soft
brown can be a little too pink when I'm
working with warm tones saddle and
texture saddle texture settle is a
little bit darker it's a warm brown it
has red tones in it same with texture
but texture has a tiny bit of sparkle in
it I mean like tiny bit so I'll swatch
saddle for you hopefully it shows up
they're saddled right there and texture
I use these both in my videos so okay
I'm not going on my palm their texture
so it's not as pigmented a saddle which
I love because I a lot of times like
when I'm in a rush I just go to my go to
makeup look which is just like soft
brown texture and then like all the
glitters in the lid and I'm done for a
gold amber lights is my absolute fave so
beautiful are you joking
oh it looks amazing with everything I
love love amber lights and saddles
together maybe I should do a tutorial
because I wear out all the time
especially in the summer so pretty then
Swiss chocolate gorgeous it's a matte
shade very very putting the outer crease
warm again
I'm just a warm girl I love my warm
colors love sable twinks twinks is
purple lean and stable is just like
perfection it's like a Bobby Brown and
so pretty do you see that
I used to wear sable all over my lid and
just blend out with soft brown so
gorgeous or if you want to step it up
and grab a paint pile like this like
quite natural long just a dark brown
paper or you can do something like
constructivists and get a Paint Pot like
that and then put it over top or the
difference if your manes calls do me
show you I'll show you see okay so
there's a Paint Pot hey
and I'll take sable which is already
right there on my hand but if you put it
over a Paint Pot just amps up your local
times a million and you just blend out
with some soft round liner no liner and
you're done so pretty and then twinks a
purpley brown it's in my brown palette
because I consider it brown but yet like
when I work there some of the artists
considered purple and some of the
artists used it to blend with purple I
just I see it as brown it's just a
purpley brown to me it's brown but it's
beautiful
let's see you so we'll take this right
oh god that's gonna work
you see it right there in the center yes
you can see that so it's like a purpley
brown so pretty
once again all over the lid blend it out
blah blah blah perfection so in my red
palette I am sure I did before my red
brown smokey eye those colors are my
absolute favorite
so I'm not gonna swatch them for you
because you see the million times in
that video but it's red brick rule and
Brown script those are my favorite Reds
all-time they're actually my favourite
colors from Mac and a story red brick
roll and brown script favorite colors
the Mac makes I absolutely love them
sketch I'm actually wearing sketch of my
eye today in the outer corner and I know
if you can see it very well but it's
like deep down in there it's like a
really plummy wine color purple it's so
pretty for like a really dark dramatic
smokey eye I've taken this and put it
all over the lid mmm just blend it up
with another purple or you can use it
all by itself or you can put in the
crease that I'm wearing right now I've
blended out with reds and oranges before
so pretty
my phone is ringing okay next satin
taupe I love satin taupe with sketch in
the outer corner it's so pretty or you
can just do satin taupe with browns you
can do it with black and I get a smoky
eye it's really quite beautiful
what
it is exactly as it says it looks like
satin taupe also expensive pink so
beautiful
it's a goldish pink and it is so pretty
especially for the summertime
and it is the most pigmented color of
all time
it's just like so it feels like silk and
it's just gorgeous you can have so much
fun with expensive pink it's ridiculous
I blend out with roll or coral okay see
Here I am I'm trying to teach you guys
things again I'm not I'm just not good
this whole YouTube thing yet give me
some time and subscribe one of my
favorite colors ever is copper ring when
I worked as a Mac in Chicago Pierre and
if you're watching hi Pierre love you he
used to call me copper ring because I
could not get enough of this color it's
a copper color and I used to wear it
like every single day and I would try to
incorporate it in my look somehow if it
was like an inner corner or the crease I
would always try throw it in there
because I just I love that color so much
so yes
copper ring absolutely beautiful last
favorites I shadow from Mac is antiqued
do I have a finger I do not so sorry
thigh
antiqued so pretty this is the color
once again that you can just wear all by
itself and it's Gorge right there boom

tone absolutely beautiful so I'm gonna
go wash my hands now because this is not
the cutest look thanks for watching I
