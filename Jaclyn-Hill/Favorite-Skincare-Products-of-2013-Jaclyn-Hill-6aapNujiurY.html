talking about my favorite skincare
products of the year 2013 I am not
wearing any makeup on my face today I am
wearing mascara but I'm not wearing any
makeup on my face today because I figure
this is a skincare dedicated video so
you can love me for me in my own natural
skin I only cleanse and moisturize today
and that's all that you're getting on a
day-to-day basis I do not do a full face
of makeup at all I actually think I wear
makeup less than I do wear makeup I'm
like not this diva who has to have a
full face of makeup to go get a loaf of
bread like not whatsoever I definitely
want to encourage you to be confident in
your own skin and not feel like you have
to hide behind a mask because makeup is
just supposed to be fun and playtime and
enhance how you already feel about
yourself inside because that is
definitely more important than anything
else I ever speak about here on my
channel or any part that you could
possibly buy is how you feel within so
yeah I really hope that you guys enjoy
this video and let's talk about skincare
I'm going to start off with face
cleansers and there were only two it
really stuck out to me this year and you
guys know which one I'm going to mention
first it is the impurity a one-step
facial cleanser what they mean by
one-step is that it is going to clean
your skin remove your makeup and tone
your face with just one formula this is
a very universal face wash it's pretty
much great for all different skin tones
it has some natural oils in it so it's
going to go back in and help moisturize
as well it is just a great universal
cleanser if you have a hard time finding
a cleanser that really works for you
this is definitely something I would
recommend and it's not super pricey and
it's also on QVC like all the time you
can get like jumbo bottles for like 25
30 bucks so yes he really wants that
facial Hunter this next cleanser I
discovered this year my sister has been
using this brand and a sensor for years
and years and years and so she got me
addicted the beginning of this year and
it is the fresh soy face cleanser it
says here that it is for all skin types
rich in amino acids and it gently
cleanses the face and eyes so the amino
acids are going to help firm and tighten
the skin tighten the skin so that's
really great for mature women it's also
going to be super sensitive because it's
all for all skin types and it
really soothing and it's also nourishing
and it has a little bit of oil in it so
that doesn't strip your skin of all oils
because that really is not a fun feeling
and even super oily people should not be
stripping all their oils out of their
face so yeah super gentle great for
sensitive skin just make sure that you
do not have an allergy to soy products
because that's a very common thing in
the skincare world there will be soy
products and some allergic reaction
because they're alert to soy so if
you've tried thing with slow before you
haven't broken out anything then you're
good wine I'm doing this with my hands
right now anyway as long as you don't
have an allergic reaction to soy this is
a great gentle cleanser for all skin
types if I didn't show you the product
I'm so rude I'm going to talk about
toners now as we're like moving through
our skincare routine I will start with
the first toner that I use this year and
that is the Mario Badescu cucumber
cleansing lotion I know it's going to
get confusing you could wear lotion and
get it to toner but in the skincare
world if the word lotion is in the title
and it's a total liquid then liquid then
it is a toner this one specifically is
made for combination oily skin I am dry
so I didn't use this every single day it
says that you can use this twice a day I
use it every night or every other night
depending on how my skin was feeling at
that moment in time I did go through 2
or 3 bottles I think this is my third
bottle that I went through this year I
use it quite a lot so it does remove oil
residue it helps prevent breakouts it
takes out bacteria it disinfects so it's
really really great for people with
problematic skin it would really help
take out all the dirt and like gunk for
my pores
I didn't struggle with like bad acne
this year but I did struggle with
texture and just clogged pores and this
really really helped with that it's also
a very budget-friendly product so I
highly recommend this toner to anyone
who's looking for one this is the lush
breath of fresh air
toner water they are a few different
toners there and it literally just
sprays out and you spray it on your face
like this it's really really nice and
it's a mineral rich sea breeze capture
in a bottle and it has aloe vera and
it's soothing rose and clarifying herbs
so this is one that is
my sensitive skin so I am dry and AM
sensitive there are a bunch of different
ones there for whatever your skin needs
are but I really like this it's simple
it's not something that like really made
this huge impact in my skincare routine
but it's something that I really enjoyed
it felt nice it was soothing and it made
my skin super soft so lush
breath-of-fresh-air this is not an
actual toner this is a facial spray and
it is the Mario Badescu facial spray
with aloe herbs and rosewater this is
created for all skin types I started
using this in 2012 and fell in love with
it I think this is my third bottle at
this point maybe fourth I primarily use
it when I wasn't wearing any makeup
because it really hydrates and
conditions gives your skin a really
natural glow to it it says you can use
it as a makeup setting spray but it will
not prolong the life of your makeup
whatsoever and if you spray too much of
it it can do the opposite effect and
kind of melt your makeup away and break
it up so I would be careful with that
but it is a really nice product if
smelled luxurious it smells like a bed
of roses so yeah I really like this
Mario Badescu facial spray with aloe
herbs and lose water I only have one
exfoliator to mention because as I
talked about before I do like using
organic sugar to exploit my face and
then I will sometimes mix it with like
olive oil or lemon juice but this is one
that I have been in love with all year
long and it is the lush ocean salt face
and body scrub this says it is a coarse
and fine sea salt scrub with organic
lime juice to brighten an avocado butter
to soften so this is something that you
could totally make yourself in the
kitchen and be the exact same thing it
looks like this inside I love the color
of it it's so pretty this is a new one I
just got it last week when I went to
lush and this is such a great Sleater
for all skin types because sea salt is
great for acne it's absolutely amazing
but at the same time it's not going to
dry you out so it's also good for people
who have dry skin not to mention the
avocado butter is going to be super
hydrating so really anybody can use this
dry sensitive acne prone it's a great
great exfoliator it's the only one that
I actually have ever used I feel like is
worth it other than just making
something yourself at home but you can
make this yourself at home but ok I'm
done this product is a total Rando
everybody needs this in their medicine
cabinet every man every woman anybody
with a face needs this product this is
the Mario Badescu drying lotion this is
made for all skin types and like I said
everybody basically what it is is it's a
zip zap ER it looks like this in the
bottle you can see you take a q-tip you
stick your q-tip all the way into the
bottom of that pink powder and it's
gonna come out kind of like wet and
almost like clay you put that on a q-tip
and then you place it wherever like you
have zip pimple a breakout blemish
whatever is happening you can do it as
soon as you want or as late as you want
you go to bed and you sleep with that on
your skin and it literally will zap your
blemish away and it's just like it's
amazing I use it two nights ago and it's
just like oh it's just perfect it's such
a great product if you have a face if
you ever get blemishes you need this
product joseon-era 100% pure argan oil
are the first videos I want to talk
about this is the original and it's the
Josie Maran 100% pure argan oil and
that's it this is like what started the
entire beauty oil fene that is happening
to the market now this is an organic
moisturizing oil it's so great for
sensitive skin so great for dry skin so
great for oily skin combination skin it
is an amazing oil and you can use this
all over your body you can use it in
your hair it's natural you can do
everything with this oil it is an
absolutely awesome oil it is a thick
true oil though don't get me wrong like
when you put this on your face you're a
greased chicken so this is definitely
something that you're only going to want
to use in the evening time when you're
going to bed and no makeup can be put on
overtop of this because it is just going
to slide and melt right off that face
the next one is the josie maran 100%
pure argan oil light so this is the
ultra lightweight formula you can
totally tell the difference between
these two this one can be worn during
the daytime as long as you apply a very
thin layer of it and then you can apply
your makeup over top this one feels more
like a dry oil and absorbs into the skin
within like 10 minutes it doesn't leave
you feeling super greasy or like over
the top at all this is great if you are
a very oily person
and you're afraid of using videos I
would recommend this one for you that's
the light formula and we're that so that
at nighttime but for those of you who
are oily I know so many of my customers
and clients in the past have been like
oh I'm oily I don't want moisturizer I
don't I'll but oil combats oil so if you
apply oil to your face at nighttime it
is going to reduce your body over
producing so much oil so I recommend you
do or else everybody they're amazing
this this was a limited edition I
believe but I still see it my Sephora
it's the Josie Maran one hard step here
argan oil with radiance so this one it's
like super goopy and you can see it has
some color in it where the other ones
don't it has a little bit of luminosity
in it and this one is not as heavy is
the original argan oil so this is really
nice underneath of your foundation when
you're feeling at all dry or if you want
extra glow so once again you have to do
a very light small amount of it not
thick coat whatsoever otherwise it's
your makeup is only going to stay
looking nice for like an hour so but all
three of these josie maran beauty oils
are just amazing I love them they're
great for sensitive skin they're great
for all skin so if you're looking for a
beauty oil to invest in and you're
overwhelmed by so many of them on the
market I would start off with just the
original josie maran our nut oil it's
great this is the bow shot Beauty oil I
do not know how to pronounce everything
else happening on this bottle so excuse
me for that but this is an anti-aging
formula so this is going to help with
again more mature skin and it also what
does it say on here is it hydrates
replenishes leading skin smoother softer
and more supple of course and has high
level of antioxidants which is always
really nice so this is definitely a
beauty oil that someone who is more
mature would really enjoy it is much
thinner than the Josie Maran Argan oils
and this says that it can be used during
the day underneath of makeup which I
have never tried and only use this one
at nighttime and I did like it but it
wasn't as thick as the formulas that I'm
used to so I hadn't used it like a month
this oil has taken over my life and it
is the fresh Seabury oil and this has
Omega
three six seven and nine and it's 100%
pure moisture with sea buckthorn oil
this is amazing it's lightweight but
thick at the same time it's soothing it
smells good it's so moisturizing but
when I wake up in the morning I'm not
still greasy it's like it's super
intense but after like twenty to thirty
minutes my skin starts accepting it it's
not as thick as it josie maran I don't
believe but I have just been loving this
oil I actually have mixed this in the
Josie Maran a lot recently and I really
like those two combined but I'm like
neck to neck tie with both of these
right now I really don't know which one
I like better I might okay
I don't know but I love them both we are
done with beauty oils we are now moving
on to daily facial moisturizers so this
right here is the Shiseido Ibuki with
finding a moisturizer
I do not know too much about this
moisturizer all I know is that I went
into sephora about a month or so ago and
told the esthetician who works in the
back that I was looking for a daily
moisturizer made for dry skin but not
too thick and nothing they would clog my
pores and she recommended this line to
me she told me that it was fairly new
but they've heard great things about it
so I really like it I love the way it
smells it really smells like a spa I
enjoy putting out my face every day it
is on the thin side so I definitely
could see someone who is combination to
oily using this and not being overly
hydrated it lays beautifully under
makeup like beautifully this is one my
favorite moisturizers to put under my
makeup as of this moment and I do switch
my moisturizers out pretty much every
single day so my skin doesn't get
acclimated to anything but I have been
loving this Shiseido Ibuki I'm assuming
that's how it's pronounced Ibuki
whatever this I've been using pretty
much all year I've had it since the week
it came out and this is the origins
ginseng energy boosting moisturizer this
is very hydrating it is on the thicker
side as soon as I get to the bottom of
my moisturizers I'm like oh I get to go
get a new one
it smells like straight oranges oh my
gosh it smells so good
it says that you can apply this and or
PM and that it's energizing and
hydrating
I wouldn't recommend this to someone
who's super oily I
it's someone who's more normal
accommodation could use it because it is
pretty thick it's not like intensely
thick but it's a pretty thick daily
moisturizer but I love it and it gives a
beautiful glow to the skin this is the
old Hendrickson truth cream advanced
hydration provides multi-level
moisturization with our bands hydration
complex and it's for all skin types and
anti-aging oh my god looks like this
this one I get is very citrusy it says
you can apply it to your face and neck
and or PM this one I'm not insane about
the smell not crazy about it not as much
as the origins but it's nice again very
lightweight doesn't clog my pores looks
beautiful on the skin doesn't get greasy
throughout the day it's a really really
beautiful moisturizer these were my
first skin care Lancome purchases that
I've ever made and it was the new line
that came out this year and it's the
energy Denis I think it's called I'm not
quite sure it's in this green packaging
when I first bought it they said it was
exclusive to Sephora I don't know if
that's still the truth it says that you
can apply this AM or PM so this right
here is the toner and it looks like I
haven't used any like it's only down
there and I swear I'd use this thing
like 50 to 70 times I really like it
they are very moisturizing it smell
great again oh god it smells so good it
didn't clog my pores it was awesome for
sensitive skin I would again say that
you could use this as long as you're not
crazy oily because it is on the thicker
side this right here needs to be applied
with your fingertips they made that like
very clear to me when you apply it you
need to be tapping into the skin and not
using like a cotton pad or cotton ball
to apply it so you do both of these
after you cleanse your skin I love it
though I have no complaints about either
of these they were great to me and my
sensitive skin to high products I use
this year this goes hand in hand with
the origins ginseng and this is the
refreshing eye cream to brighten and
deep up I absolutely love this eye cream
and again it looks like I haven't used
that much but it came overflowing and I
use this I think every single morning
for about six months and I'll show you
how it has like this little glow it has
a little bit of color in it so when
you're not wearing makeup it gives you
this really
actual luminous finish for the eyes so
natural no glitter but it's almost like
there's an iridescent shimmer in it and
it's just it's perfectly done it's
beautiful it's moisturizing I wear my
makeup over every single day and it
never interfered whatsoever sometimes
some eye creams can be too much on the
eyes and you try to like brown eyeshadow
and it's just a hot mess but this one
beautiful it dries perfectly this one
again goes hand in hand with this
Shiseido one this is another thing from
their collection
boo-ki this is the eye correcting cream
smells great goes on nice and smooth and
it does not irritate your eyes which is
a big deal to me when it comes to eye
cream because you're not supposed to
apply eye cream super super close to
your eye just on the bone around but
sometimes I'll get a little heavy-handed
and get too close and it'll start just
like the fragrance or just the
moisturizer itself will start seeing my
eyes and that drives me off the wall so
both of these do not sing my eye and if
they have it has not been long enough or
irritating enough for me to really even
notice like some other eye creams I'm
like oh my god my eyes and that's not
cute okay I'm going to talk about two
night creams I absolutely love this year
the first one is the caviar night cream
I've spoken about this before in the
beginning of the year or maybe the end
of 2012 this is for dry and sensitive
skin and you are going to want to be dry
or to use this I don't know if you can
even see inside this tub but it's like
thick it is thick thick thick stuff um I
used to use it every single night when I
wake up in the morning my skin was so
hydrated it was insane and then my josie
maran argan oil kind of took over this
even though it doesn't need to be
replaced they could be used together I
just kind of ended up switching it out
throughout the time went on really great
though if you're dry and you wake up in
the morning a super dry this is amazing
and it's very inexpensive this is the
more recent
I question and this is by Korres and
this is the advanced nourishing sleeping
facial this I purchased about three to
four months ago at Sephora and I am all
obsessed you can see how much I have
gone through absolutely in love with
this product so this is referred to as a
sleeping facial so you just apply it all
over the face like you would a mask and
then you go to bed and then in the
morning you wake up wash your face like
normal and it just leaves your skin so
hydrated soft luxurious
it's nice and thick but it doesn't feel
like it's clogging your pores it doesn't
feel like it's overwhelming it doesn't
think you're putting butter on your face
where you're just like oh this is
uncomfortable it's so creamy and
luxurious it feels beautiful I
absolutely love this and you can mix it
with something else you just put this on
first so I do use my oils with it so
I'll cut it first and then five minutes
later I'll go in and put a beauty oil
overtop absolutely perfect in the
morning my skin has never ever felt
better so absolutely love this course
advanced nourishing sleeping facial okay
we're going to talk about masks and I've
got a good amount of them this is the
luscious mask of Magnum in tea this is
really great for dark spots it also
helps to exfoliate it's got peppermint
oil in it so it literally smells like
straight peppermint you can put it in
your refrigerator a revert or and then
apply it to your face while it's cold
and it'll be like even more intense I
don't think I could deal with that even
though I love peppermint it's already so
intense and like stimulating but this is
really really great it really brings
everything out and makes it feel like
it's like pulling and detoxifying so I
love this mask and it's literally all
because of my sister this is so popular
she's going to mention this on her blog
in the first place and then me Anika
wood shopping I was like let's go get
the snack my sister was soft
about and how it's been like sold out
everywhere I will put my sister's blog
down below in the description bar for
any of you who want to check her out
she's an aesthetician and amazing at
life the glam below super mud mask this
little tiny baby that contains so many
powers so this is a clearing treatment
if you guys don't know about mud masks
they are great it really detoxifies and
pulls so much out from your pores and
it's like looks like mud which is so
much fun as you can see I have been
scraping the bottom for mine I owned it
now for probably I would say six to
eight months and I applied very thin
layer of it I absolutely love it it
truly does feel life-changing the first
time I use this I was shocked I've never
had a mask do so much so drastically in
my life this is the Mario Badescu enzyme
revitalizing mask it is for combination
dry and sensitive skin all this is
really going to do is hydrate and
condition and soften it makes your skin
feel so luxurious it smells good it's
not hardening so it doesn't get like
really intense and hard on your skin
where you feel like you can't move or do
anything you leave this on for 20
minutes when you take it off your skin
just feels baby soft super super
hydrating so I really really enjoyed
this mask I used it constantly I think
this is my second or third one in the
past like a year and a half so Ensign
revitalizing mask this is the Mario
Badescu flower and tonic mask this is
made for combination oily and sensitive
skin so even though I'm dry I absolutely
love this mask this says that it is
going to help tighten pores and absorb a
surface oil without over-drying while
healing botanicals calm redness and
soothe skin so since I am sensitive this
really helps with the redness aspect and
it really did tighten pores and remove
surface oils so kind of gives you like a
fresh start even dry girls sometimes
just need to stuff everything out and
start fresh so I really like this I've
gone through two of them in the past
year and a half I will leave so flower
and tonic masque
this is the fresh rose face mask this
says right here that is infused with
real rose petals hydrates and tones it
says it is going to moisturize hydrate
it's a unique cooling gel formula that's
infused with pure rose water it has
green tea
it's going to help protect right and so
basically everything you want in a mask
it is a little strange-looking but it
really does work it feels very cooling
on your skin it just is awesome whenever
I watch my face if you get a sample of
this or you purchase to yourself you
learn talking about there's no feeling
like when you wash this off this mask
makes your skin feel incredibly smooth
for the next few hours it's crazy so I
will use this one sometimes in the
morning it's not like harsh to your skin
all it's just nice and refreshing and
then go in with my moisturizer into my
makeup and my skin just feels like it's
like singing a song all day long it's
beautiful this is the fresh black tea
instant perfecting mask this says that
it's advanced antioxidants immediately
reveals softer and firmer skin so
another product that would be great for
mature skin and anyone who is concerned
with fine lines or aging or anything
like that
it says the fresh black tea instantly
perfecting mask is hydrating treatment
that you immediately feel softer firmer
healthier looking skin it is enriched
with black tea it helps defend against
wrinkle causing free radicals and boost
collagen it's got lychee seed extract
it's great the way this pill in the skin
again is so unique I don't know how to
explain it it's just something that
you're going to try for yourself but I
love this my mom has used it and she
loves it as well
so it makes your skin feel a little
tight and a little bit firmer I really
really like this so this is the black
tea instant perfecting mask these are
the makeup wipes that I use all year
long and they are be ponds evening suit
wet cleansing towelettes this is with
chamomile and white tea I really like
these they are from the drugstore
obviously so they are very wallet
friendly I just really really like them
I have super sensitive skin as I've
mentioned I don't know seven hundred
times during this video
they don't irritate my eyes it'll break
me out and I'll clog my pores they've a
really nice scent and they just take the
makeup right off just the same as any
high-end wet towel that would I just
really
really enjoy this I'd use a couple other
what towelettes from the drugstore and
none of them I really like as much as
this one so I just love it it's a great
makeup remover I have to mention my
beloved Clarisonic this thing changed my
life this year well technically I did
get it in December I think of last year
or maybe November of 2012 so yes i use
all 4 2013 and let me just say that this
is one of the best thing ever invented
for the skin and such a difference my
friends and family have all told me that
they notice such a difference in my skin
in the tone and the spots dark spots the
sun spots everything oh like women in my
family knows the difference in wrinkles
and fine lines and it is just it's
amazing and helps so much with texture
and breakout it's such an amazing tool
so all it does is just help cleanse your
skin it runs for a minute and you just
rub in your cleanser and it is just it
is like changing when I go one week
without using this I will see such a cry
for help in my skin and I know that I
have to get back to using my Clarisonic
so I love this thing
so so much it truly is just a game
changer in the skincare world alright
guys those itch for my favorite skincare
products of 2013 I really hope you
enjoyed this video as you can tell I do
not mind spending money on skincare
products at all it is the most important
step in my beauty routine hands down at
the end of the day you wash off your
makeup and this is what you're left with
so I do not mind investing in products
that are going to help prevent from any
damage and keep my skin looking as good
as possible because your makeup is only
going to look as good as what you have
underneath so I'm a skincare junkie and
I'm constantly trying to find best
products if you guys have any
recommendations for me but you think
that I would actually love after getting
to know my skin and the things I like
please feel free to recommend anything
you want to me I look at guys so much I
hope you enjoy this video and for those
of you who are going to IMAX this
weekend I cannot wait to meet you and
those of you who aren't I will see you
on YouTube next week I love you all so
much and I'll talk to you soon bye
