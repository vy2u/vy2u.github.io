my February favorites I know that it is
coming a little bit late this month but
I asked you guys on Twitter and you said
better late than never so let's just
jump into it I do want to first announce
slash address slash introduce something
and if you follow me on Twitter then you
know exactly we're going to talk about
because it's been blowing up recently on
my Twitter and that is my Sigma Beauty
Expert box
I am super super excited about this I
have been working on it with Sigma for a
few months now and I've just been
wanting to tell all of you guys so badly
so this didn't release at midnight this
last Saturday and night and the reason
I'm talking about it in this video is
because I want to quickly show you what
it is and tell you the situation so I
was able to pick out my favorite seven
brushes by Sigma of what I think that
all of you would enjoy the most what
everyone needs in their collection so of
course I picked out the f80 face
foundation brush like come on and of
course the f-86 which is not a concealer
brush I use it for concealer I encourage
it everyone else use it for concealer
it's absolutely beautiful the tapered
highlighter brush and all over big fat
blending black brush the all-over
eyes shadow e55 and then the smaller
more precise goat hair blending brush
and then a pencil brush so right here is
pretty much all a woman needs to do
their makeup and it is at a discounted
price so it's a really great opportunity
to get these brushes that typically do
not come in a kit for such a great deal
on top of it there is of course always
the 10% code that Sigma offers and then
you can use that to cover the cost of
shipping and that extra 10% so I am so
excited about this box it is limited
edition it is only here for the month of
March and it did sell out in the first
two and a half days of being released so
because of that I just wanted to address
the situation because so many of you on
Twitter have been thinking that it's
gone forever and you didn't get to have
a chance to buy it
that is not the case you can set it for
an email to be notified this second it
comes back out and it is released again
they are coming out with a bunch more
kits for you guys so that all of you can
go ahead and purchase who did not get
your chance to so I will link all that
down below the brush kit the email that
you can sign up for they also the
and answer with me just about random
things in my life you really get to know
me and stuff like that so I will link
all of that down below so that you can
check it out for yourself you can sign
up for the email list or you can just
wait I will of course announce it when
it comes back on my Twitter Instagram
and here on YouTube so I am just super
super excited Thank You Sigma they've
never done one of these boxes before and
I was so honored when they asked me and
I truly do believe that anybody who
purchases this this box will not be
dissatisfied so now that we got that's
over with let's move on to my favorites
I have a lot of cheek products this
month well actually I have a lot of
everything products this month but I'm
going to start off with my cheek
products and try to just breeze through
things pretty quickly and the first
thing I want to talk about are my new
favorite highlighters of all time and
they are by the brand Becca they are the
exact same highlighter but they are in
two different shades one is moonstone
and one is opal I have talked about opal
and quite a few of my tutorials in the
past two months
and I have mentioned that it is an
amazing dupe for a Mac whisper of guilt
which if you are familiar Mac whisper of
guilt is a extra skin diminish dimension
extra dimension skin finish boom extra
dimension skin finish that released a
couple of years ago and they did not
make it permanent so because of that
everyone wants it and this one is so
similar it's the perfect amount of
bronze in it but yet the fairest of
girls can still wear as a highlighter
but it just has this beautiful bronzy
effect I just absolutely love it I've
been wearing it for pretty much two
months straight and that is again in the
shade opal this other one is the exact
same product but in the shade moonstone
this one is more of a vanilla more
neutral base and this one really reminds
me of mary lou manizer by the balm you
can see right here it just comes out a
little bit more vanilla e and if you are
super super fair then this would be the
perfect highlighter for you since it
doesn't have that bronze effect in it
like opal does both gorgeous both so
creamy so easy to apply so natural just
beautiful they just truly feel like
butter were you waiting for it only took
like a minute into the video
I'm using the word butter another
product by Becca is their blush this is
in the shade wild honey and I absolutely
oh my gosh this color is such a
beautiful shade it reminds me a lot of
Mac Sun bask but yet it's different at
the same time it doesn't have the
shimmer that Mac's on vasquez so this
looks like it's a matte when you're
looking at it and when you put it on the
skin it actually has a slight sheen to
it but there's no shimmer in it and
that's actually the thing that like all
these blushes have in common that I'm
going to talk about so it's very very
useful and great for more mature skin or
people who are concerned with blemishes
acne you have issues with tons of
texture on your face you do not want to
use a blush that has any shimmer in it
so a blush like this is just gorgeous
because it brings attention to the blush
and the light reflects off of it and
gives it a nice natural Sheen but there
is no shimmer so it's not going to draw
attention I just love it
it is the perfect color for summertime
it's like a bronze with a little bit of
rose in it it's just absolutely gorgeous
it looks beautiful just like blended in
with bronzer so yes
wild honey by Becca I'm sure you guys
knew I was going to mention these but
they are the Clinique cheek pops I did
go back and get another one I mentioned
two of them in my haul and I went back
and I got the ginger pop because it's
they are just my absolute favorites
right now I absolutely love these
blushes and just like the Becca one that
I just talked about they all have this
gorgeous sheen to it but there's no
shimmer in them which is just so
complimentary on multitudes of skin
tones this one right here is the peach
pop so you can see that it has such a
gorgeous Sheen in it but there is no
shimmer so it's not going to emphasize
any imperfections on the face but it is
just so beautiful and on those quick
days in the spring and summertime when
you're just doing tinted moisturizer
mascara coming through your brows and
putting on blush these are one of those
blushes that you want to go with because
they don't have shimmer but yet they're
not matte so it'll give you a really
beautiful glow from within without being
too much so this is peach pop plum pop
and ginger pop so as you can see ginger
is more of a burnt corally orange where
the peach pop has more of a springy
pinky feel to it and the plum
is just a gorgeous gorgeous pinky with a
little bit of purple but not too much
purple they're just gorgeous I
absolutely love them they're so easy to
apply they're not too intense or overly
pigmented they're not dusty or chalky
they're just absolutely gorgeous I'm not
a clinic girl I've never been a clinic
fan but these take the cake they are for
the win I absolutely love them last
blush I'm sure every youtuber is going
to be talking about this month or their
favorites is the hourglass ambient
lighting blush this is in the specific
shade a radiant magenta I am wearing
this color on my cheeks today as my
blush I just love it it is this gorgeous
cool tone pink shade with a bronze shade
or running through it like a little
river and I love this because I have
such a hard time wearing pink blushes
that are cool toned because of the way
my skin reacts those blushes it just
washes me out and doesn't look good with
my bronzers and I always like to do at
least a little bit of definition in my
contouring and when I use too cool of a
blush it does not mix well and it just
doesn't blend and it looks like a
disaster so I am just loving this blush
and same thing with Plum pop by Clinique
they are both just perfect washes of
color they have a cool undertone and a
little bit of purple in it but it
doesn't wash me out so if you have some
yellow undertones in your skin and pink
blushes washed you out these blushes are
the perfect color for you I just love
them so beautiful the way it goes on
it's like impossible to overdo it with
this blush it's the perfect amount of
pigment where you can really build it up
but it's not too intense at all so
absolutely love these ambient lighting
blushes I have two bronzers to mention
the first one is the Smashbox Sun Tan
matte bronzer this does come in two
shades and this is the Sun Tan matte
absolutely love this bronzer it takes a
lot for me to like a bronzer because I
am extremely picky well I'm pretty much
picky when it comes to everything but I
am very picky about bronzers because it
needs to have the right amount of orange
terracotta neutral and brown I do not
like a bronzer to be too orange or too
Brown
and it just starts to come out muddy and
dusty and ashy this is just that
gorgeous perfect color so easy to apply
very blendable very easy Georgie you are
not going to go down that road
the next bronzer is by Too Faced I have
spoken about the Too Faced chocolate
Soleil bronzer this is the endless
summer 16-hour bronzer I am wearing this
one today I absolutely love it I don't
know if it truly does last for 16 hours
because I've never had an issue with my
bronzer fading throughout the day I do
always wear foundation or anything my
bronzer to help hold it on tight and I
do not have oily skin so my bronzer
doesn't really move around unless I'm in
the beading hot Sun but I just love this
color it's very blendable very creamy
goes on easy and it is right here so you
can see this Smashbox is a little bit
more red in tone and the Too Faced is a
little bit more neutral and tone both
gorgeous both easy to apply if you're
anywhere near my skin tone or even
lighter or darker you will like both of
these they're very beautiful this is a
total Rando but this is a Mac pigment
from the collection fantasy of flowers
it came out a few weeks ago and this is
the shade lily white I don't know if
this is going to still be available for
all of you I'm sure some of you still
have this at your local counters and
stores if I can find it anywhere online
I will link it down below for you but it
is just the most gorgeous
Oliver lid brow highlight inner corner
highlight cheek highlight Cupid's bow
highlight everything this pigment is
like an a bottle it is so beautiful it
looks like it's yellow but once you get
it on the skin this is going to be a
gorgeous highlight on a pretty much
everybody it is just beautiful Matt
cosmetics please make this permanent
I need this permanent in my life it is
so so pretty it honestly reminds me a
lot of nylon eyeshadow by Mac so if you
cannot find this and you really want it
nylon shadow is very very similar just a
shadow instead of a pigment I have used
these Sigma Eclipse eyepencil a few
times this month and I really really
love it I did use it any tutorial it was
my Valentines Day tutorial I believe
and it's just super creamy extremely
black goes on really smooth doesn't
leave my eyes irritated and it stays for
a long time sorry I'm having a hard time
speaking right now my words are like
stuck in my mouth
I feel like I reef all in love with this
product every single spring and it is
the NARS a larger-than-life long wearing
eye pencil in the shade Rua Bonaparte I
believe oh oh I believe that's how you
pronounce it I'm not positive on that it
is just a gorgeous beige cream color I
am wearing it on my waterline today it's
just a really nice way to make your eyes
pop make them look bigger and fresher
and especially if you're really tired if
you're wearing a smoky eye and your eyes
just seem to look small and like weighed
down this is a way just pop it in your
waterline and just wake your eyes up and
make them look fresh it's so beautiful
in the spring and summertime you can't
even see the swatch in the back of my
hand it's literally just the color of
skin but it really does last on the
waterline all day long I used to wear
this at work all the time and I never
had a touch-up so I really love that
that is the NARS rue Bonaparte of course
I will put the spelling down below my
description bar in case you're like what
I'm sure you guys do that I was going to
talk about oh I'm sure you guys knew
that I was going to talk about this
foundation in my February favourites
because I pretty much talked about it
all month and that is the tarte maracuja
miracle foundation this is supposed to
be a 12 hour where foundation and I
absolutely love it I do not have
anything bad to say about it other than
the fact that I just love it it is
amazing if you are normal skin dry skin
very dry skin or you just want to have
that dewy glow this is the foundation
for you I don't feel like it moves
sometimes a dewy glowy foundation will
slip and slide all over your face this
one it does not do that if they do it
does not it stays put and I really
really enjoy it I've been using it all
month long that is where I'm wearing
today is my foundation and I just love
it let's talk about lip products this
one I just realized I don't have ever
mentioned it on YouTube and I was like
that's really weird when I was putting
it on last night because I've been
wearing it since January and it is the
philosophy pink almond candy lip balm
mine is totally flat because I use it so
much
when it came it was like a round top
like the eos falls but now it's just a
flat one it is just so so smooth buttery
creamy a luxurious smells literally like
pink almond candy and I just love it I
put this on before I go to bed and it's
so moisturizing so nice to lip glosses
and I feel like everybody has been
talking about these lip glosses for the
past month or two but there's a good
reason for that because they are really
awesome and that is the whitening
lightening color your smile tinted lip
glosses I have the color nude and Fiji
Fiji is a baby pink and nude is a
perfect nude I love these because they
have a little light right here so when
you're applying your lip gloss it lights
up your face and it has a little mirror
on the side so you can literally be like
hey on Valentine's Day I wore this nude
color and I kept pulling it out to touch
up and every single time I pull it out a
girl would be like where is that from
that is so adorbs I'm like oh so it
definitely sparks up conversation so
this right here is just one fast swipe
nudists on top Fiji is on bottom so as
you can see gorgeous nude perfect baby
pink absolutely love them both I have
been loving this lip gloss for two
months I believe now and it is the NARS
Angelica I just love this formula from
NARS because it is perfect in the sense
that it's not too sheer and it's not too
pigmented because I don't always like my
glosses super pigmented I prefer my
lipsticks pigmented and my gloss is more
on the sheer side and I just love this
it is the perfect pink rosy shade it's
not like a hot pink but yeah it's not
just a rose it's like a raspberry that's
the perfect name for this it should be
called raspberry it is the perfect
raspberry shade I absolutely love it it
just brings life to your face and again
I love that it's not too pigmented or
too sheer it's just a beautiful wash
against the lips so pretty for spring
and summer this is a new Tarte lip
product and it is a lip surge in the
Shea
tipsy I love everything by tart in the
shade tipsy the blushes the cheek stains
I just love the shade tipsy because it's
a gorgeous Coralie with a little bit of
pink in it and I love love love this lip
color I love that it's a crayon that you
twist up I always think that super
convenient it has so much pigment and it
lasts for such a long time so for the
past month straight I have been layering
the tart tipsy and the whitening
lightening gloss in nude and I just love
the combination it is such a gorgeous
coral nude color which is so in for
spring and summer I think everything is
spring and summer but I'm just ready for
spring and summer what can I say
absolutely gorgeous and if you're darker
than me and you have a nice tan
naturally this will be a gorgeous
gorgeous nude on you but on me it's more
of a coral not a nude I have a new a
favorite mask by lush which is a big
deal because for the past couple of
months masks of Magnum NT has been all
my rage but now I have moved on to the
sacred truth I absolutely love this mask
let me say starting raph the bath this
mask is nothing crazy it's not gonna
like pull everything out to the surface
and you're not gonna wake up with a
whole new face but it is just such a
beautiful basic mask I would definitely
say this is geared towards hydration and
calming of the skin it does say that it
has wheatgrass
antioxidants and green tea so I know
that it will help with redness it will
help with calming and hydration
whenever I have used it this month I
always just feel like my skin is so much
softer and so much calmer so if anything
is inflamed or just coming to the
surface this will really help take that
down and bright in everything and just
make it feel hydrated and fresh again it
does have a slight exfoliating effect
when you're like washing it off it has
like little tiny beads in it that you
can feel which is also really nice this
is one of their masks that you need to
keep in your refrigerator so just be
conscious of that if you do purchase
this put it in your fridge soon as you
get home you can read why on the side of
the bottle and everything but just keep
it in your fridge and that again feels
so good when you're applying it to put a
cold mask on it's like oh so amazing you
guys know that I am a huge fans of the
Clarisonic I use the Mia - I made a
video about it I absolutely love it I
can't live with
like Clarisonic I just I love it moving
on the new cashmere a brush head came
out I believe in January and I have just
been in love ever since
so there's standard Clarisonic brush
head is about half the size of this this
one has two layers of bristles it has
these standard bristles underneath and
then these longer ones on top this whole
thing is made of cashmere it is so
luxurious and the best thing about this
is that it is so great for sensitive
skin they say that it is supposed to
increase hydration and be great for
mature skin it's super super sensitive
the other brush heads I would use the
sensitive or the delicate I could only
use it one time a day so I'll usually
use it at nighttime but if I use it in
the morning it would just irritate my
skin my skin would just get red
sometimes it would just kind of get like
some little marks on it just because it
would be very sensitive and just annoyed
by me constantly using a brush this I
can use it morning and night my skin
doesn't get sensitive and I just love it
that it has so much movement in it as
opposed to the other one there was so
much stiffer I just love love love this
and it really does help hydrate I can
very much tell a difference with the old
brush head and this one as far as
hydration goes so I love love this
cashmere brush head I have owned this
product for months and finally used it
in the month of February for the first
time and that is the glam glow bright
mud eye treatment I was having an issue
with my eye area I was getting all these
little bumps all over my eyes that were
just tiny and I could tell it was dry
skin and I was so confused because I
used so many eye creams and oils to
prevent dry skin around my eye area that
I was just confused
so I busted this out and it literally
changed my entire eye area with the
dryness issue right here it has these
two little things in each pack these
little pockets one pocket will do both
eyes you just tap it on all over the eye
area wait three minutes gently wipe it
off and then go on with your nighttime
routine and it just hydrates so much
supposed to help with everything
brightening wrinkles aging dryness
everything you can think of I only had
to use this one time and I could
immediately tell a difference the next
day my makeup one on so much smoother
the bumps were gone it's amazing so you
can use this
times a week I've been using about about
twice a week for the whole month and I
just absolutely love it so it's the glam
glow bright mud eye treatment I rarely
talk about hair products here on my
channel but I just want to mention these
because they have really really changed
my hair in the past month and it is the
pure ology pure of volume shampoo and
conditioner I have major issue with
volume in my hair I have extremely fine
hair but I have a lot of it so it looks
like I should have voluminous hair but I
don't it wants to lay flat all day every
day and no shampoo has ever actually
helped with volume until this I have
been using volumizing shampoos my entire
life and they've never done anything but
the pure ology volumizing shampoo
conditioner truly makes a difference I
am not lying to you I actually have
volume in my hair for the first time
pretty much in my entire life so I am
very thankful for pure ology so if you
have issues with your hair laying flat I
would definitely recommend spending the
money and trying pure ology volumizing
shampoo alright guys that is it for my
February favourites I really hope you
