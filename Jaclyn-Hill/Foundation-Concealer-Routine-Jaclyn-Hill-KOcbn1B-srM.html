going to be doing my updated foundation
and concealer routine I'm sorry if I
sound really nasally today I woke up
with terrible allergies or maybe I'm
getting sick I don't know who cares
anyway so let's just get started I'm not
gonna bore you I was planning on using
the Revlon Colorstay whipped foundation
which is from the drugstore um but if
you can't tell which probably can't in
this lighting um I've been out in the
Sun a lot and I've gotten a lot of color
and so this is actually too light for me
right now so I'm using the foundation
that matches me really well which is
going to be Mac's
mineralized it's their new moisture SPF
foundation it just came out like two
months ago and I'm using shade NC 30 and
okay so the first thing I was going to
do is I'm going to pump out on the back
of my hand and then I'm going to use my
Sigma flat top kabuki this is the f80 I
have talked about this brush so much
it's insane
I can't get enough of it it's absolutely
amazing so I'm going to do is I'm just
going to you want to start off with
smaller amounts okay so I'm going to
start off by just dabbing that in and
I'm going to start working in circular
motions I like to start on the outer
side of my cheek that's just what I'm
comfortable with
and then like you can see I just got
that glob I'm going to take that and I'm
going to work that all around this area
you want to start off more sheer and
then build up you do not want to just
throw on a big amount um that's why a
lot of times you'll see um people when
they apply foundation
they'll take dots and put it all over
their face and then go in I personally
don't like doing that to myself or my
clients because you never know when it's
going to be too much and it's not easy
to take off foundation once it's already
sitting on the skin so I like to work
off the back of my hand um because you
can get a better idea and feel for
what's going to look best also this
foundation I am using
it is extremely moisturizing if you are
very oily you are not going to like this
foundation because it's going to make
you a greasy monster um but since I'm
dry I love it it does need to be set
with a powder though no matter what so
when I get up here to my eyebrows I'm
going to go on top of them I do my eyes
first for a reason
so I primed my eyes I do my eye shadow
and then I do my eyeliner on my top
mascara off I'm going to put lashes on
and then I do my foundation and the
reason for that is because if I do my
foundation first the family when I am
working with my eyes the liner or the
shadow or any sort of pigment will fall
down on my cheeks and it will ruin my
foundation it might not make that big of
a difference but if you do this step and
you do the eyes first and the fake
second your guarantee for your
foundation to look exactly how you want
it to because your eye shadow is not
going to mess it up at all so I always
concentrate a lot in the middle of my
eyebrows because I always tend to get my
foundation breaks up a lot in there so I
always have to put a good amount in
there and then I have to set it so I
wait to do my eyebrows until after my
foundation is done so as of right now I
am just going over them and it doesn't
matter because the foundation will
almost act as a primer for the pigment
that I put on my brows ok make sure you
get around the nose really well alright
that's enough for foundation for now if
you have to go back later and realize
that like you know you need to put more
on or something you can do that but as
of right now let's move on to concealer
I have a few of them that I really love
but I'm going to use the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer today because it's
going to show up the most on camera
because it's very full coverage so I
want you guys to Stephen doing UM nw20
is a little too pasty for me and NW 25
is around the same color - a little too
dark so I'm going to take the two and
I'm just going to mix that
together on the back of my hand and then
what I will do is take my finger and
just mix it together to make a puddle
and then I will take it and put three
dots on the eyes now I'm going to take
my Beauty Blender so I wet this all
right I take it I put it underneath this
thing it starts off a lot smaller than
this and you just squeeze squeeze
squeeze squeeze squeeze and then it's
going to get bigger and bigger and
bigger to this size once it gets to this
size I take a paper towel I wrap it and
I squeeze out any of the excess water so
that it's not dripping wet I love using
this for concealer because it just
blends it so beautifully as you will see
and it's easy so I use this pointed tip
just to go around the side of my eye
make sure you get close to your lash
line you don't want there to be any
space there I always make sure that I
get the outer corner of my eye really
well right in this area because um a lot
of times that's where you can tear up
and you can get redness there very
easily so I always make sure to get a
good amount of concealer right that
outer corner of my eye so yeah that
quickly the concealer is completely done
on that eye so you can see I wasn't
joking when I say how easy that is and
we'll just do the exact same thing over
here and a very important step when
doing concealer is to make sure that you
get the inner corners because you ever
see those girls wear like their face is
one shade and then the under eyes one
shade but then in here is way lighter or
way darker it's because you're not
blending that concealer in that area so
even if you go in manually with your
fingers and blend concealer and that
inner eye I recommend it
you don't want that to be sitting there
so I can even take a little bit more off
the back of my hand just it's high any
bit and I'll touch it right in here
just to make sure that none of that
color is different we want all of this
color to move together even though like
the inner part of our face with that
concealer is a little bit lighter we
still want it to flow we want it to have
a very even movement to it so that
nothing is choppy or jaggedy then
because that concealer was a little bit
lighter than my foundation what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take it and
I'm going to touch it on my chin I'm
going to touch it right here with my lip
and then I'm going to touch it almost in
a cross and between my eyebrows and what
this will do is even everything out so
that the foundation I just had such a
thick accent when I said that so that
the foundation isn't like dark on the
face and then bright under the eyes you
want everything to have an evenness to
it so you have to put the lightness you
only distributed throughout the face so
under eyes and then t-zone so that it
looks like a natural highlight otherwise
it's just too much
and if you want to go in and highlight
with anything else if you want to go in
and use any cream highlighter now would
be the time um because once you put
powder on your face you're done with
creams I mean like it does not matter if
I forget a cream and I'm like oh no I
completely forgot like I need to go back
it does not matter if you have put
powder on your face do not go back with
the cream because that is the quickest
way that you are going to get build-up
and cakey so once powder is on your skin
you're done you can only put powder so
like right now I feel like I maybe need
a little bit of a pinkish beige
highlight right in this area I'm feeling
like I'm not completely even so I would
do that now as opposed to doing that
later I'm going to take Mac's prep and
prime and radiant rose and just do two
slashes of that going back with the
beauty blender and then buffing this out
I know it's gonna look really really
really stark white and pink at first but
that is a-okay and you want to bring
this back all the way to the temples you
don't want to stop right here make sure
you bring it back so that it can all be
blended out make sure you bring it up on
the side of the nose and if you want to
do any contouring in this area later
that's all on you but just make sure
that you bring this highlight all around
and don't just leave it directly under
the eye and then whatever is left on the
Beauty Blender I just drag around in the
t-zone only and you can also bring it
right here if you want just because that
will help define your contour so make
your cheekbones down a little bit more
if you get on the bottom of the face
alright I'm going to take mineralize
skinfinish and medium-plus
and I'm going to just use any brush this
is a real technique real techniques
brush I don't know which one but it
looks like so all my brushes right now
are being washed and all over the place
I've been crazy busy recently so I'm
using what I've got so I'm just going to
take this and I'm going to concentrate
on the t-zone even though I am very dry
it's really important to set this
foundation especially in the hot winter
months because no matter how dry I am I
may not get oily but it will move so I
just set my t-zone area and that's
pretty much all I have to worry about
this area is not going to move no matter
what plus I'm going to go in I'm going
to use bronzers and blushes and put
powder on that area anyways so just
light amount of powder around here
and then you can also use like a
mineralized skinfinish in a light shade
or you can use something that is made
for the under-eye area if you want to
set your concealer if you want to give
more of a highlight under there that is
all on you I'm going to use this Mac Pro
highlight right here it's called
emphasize you can see how much I used it
up this weekend it is getting time to
replace it and then we're going to take
a stigma what is this f-35 this is a
tapered highlighter brush and I'm just
going to get a little bit in there I'm
going to concentrate on the inner
corners of my eye and sweep that up to
the temple and back down to the nose
just with one stroke I'm not going to go
back and get any additional highlight
for that this is just going to smooth
everything out for my under-eye
concealer and make it so that nothing
moves like that you can use anything
left on the brush once again to
highlight the areas in the t-zone and
that's that alright so now I will go
ahead and finish off the rest of my face
and I will be back in just a second
alright so I am back all I did was go
ahead and apply some bronzer blush and
highlight and I do have a video for that
so I will put that link below
I do ramble in the beginning of that
video so just go ahead and fast-forward
through me other than that all we're
going to want to do to finish off the
face is use a makeup setting spray and
these things really do work
um I'm going to use the Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray because I
think out of all of them this works on
the most variety of skin types the mac
fix+ is great too but you're going to
want to use this if you're more on the
dry to normal side because this is going
to give you a dewy finish um as opposed
to this one I don't really notice so
much of the dewy finish maybe a little
but this really sets the makeup
beautifully so I really enjoy this one
also Scandanavia model in a bottle is
great for oily skin so what sure I want
to do is I do four sprays whatever
you're comfortable with and then I look
straight forward like I'm looking into
the camera right now if I were to look
up or look down because of the mascara
on my eyelashes it would get on my face
so I get little black dots because as
its setting it is wet so it's also good
to try not to talk while you're doing
this as well because the more you talk
the more you're going to get lines in
these areas so when you spray and
everything is wet and setting try not to
make any facial expressions so that
everything stays the same and then after
that you're good it's like hair spraying
the face okay so that is my foundation
routine I really hope you guys enjoy
this video let me know if you've any
questions and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
