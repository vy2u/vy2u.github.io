since I've made a video on this month of
August and the end of July it's been an
insane month I'm so sad to see a go it's
the best month of every year for me it's
a crazy month in on my household because
it's my birthday my husband's worse too
my husband's birthday and then our
anniversary and I also flew in his
little brother to surprise him for his
birthday and he was here for seven days
and so I has been very distracted with
my life and having a great time so I'm
sorry I haven't been on YouTube for a
while at the same time I'm not sorry
because I've had so much fun okay so I'm
going to get right into it I am not
wearing foundation today because I am
going to be doing a foundation tutorial
for you guys I have gotten so many
requests for months for a foundation
tutorial my skincare routine and
highlighting and contouring so I thought
you know what
you guys are my subscribers and you guys
want to see this so what am i doing not
giving it to you so here I am I'm going
to show you what it is that you've been
asking for I'm sorry that it's taking me
so stinkin along okay so first off
before I demonstrate how I achieve a
flawless face please okay I'm going to
just give you some recommendations of my
personal favorite foundations and I
would recommend to you guys who have
different skin types than I do first of
all I want to say that I am NOT like a
mass snob I know that it can definitely
come across as that because I use so
many Mac products in my videos but I'm
not I'm not an axe not at all it just I
had a lot of access to them I got a lot
of Mac products for free and at a great
discount when I was working for the
company for a while so that is why I
have so many products the like I'm not a
max Nazi I have drugstore right here
right here for me okay so I sought to
put that out there
I know the I would be that come on girl
like why do you only use back like get
over yourself but anyways so that being
said I just want to say that one of my
two of my favorite foundations are from
the drugstore and they are L'Oreal True
Match it's L'Oreal True Match the
original and then L'Oreal True Match
Lumi and I spent recommend these because
they are gorgeous in this summer I have
been wearing the lumi very often
basically every day because I know that
like on camera I look like I like it all
dolled up everyday no you have got it so
wrong I only do like a full face of
makeup like I do my tutorials probably
twice a week other days I apply this
foundation with my fingers all over my
face and take a touch of concealer and I
mean I literally do my foundation my
entire face of makeup in like five or
six minutes now a lot of days I'm gonna
wear makeup because I really liked my
skin to breathe which I will get into in
my skincare video oh my gosh I'm getting
like a red right here when I talk really
fast I think I get red patches on my
chest is that weird like I think that's
just me
it's weird anyways but this is going to
give you a very dewy finish so I
recommend it for dry skin or skin this
doll in any way if you're oily you can
definitely use it I would have to set it
with something something L'Oreal True
Match is different the first the
original one this one is going to be for
more oily skin tone and combination this
is skin tone skin type and combination
skin because this one isn't a super do
you wanna and this one has great lasting
power and the color range is amazing
there's like think over 20 different
colors drugstore which is great for
drugstore then Make Up For Ever HD
foundation which I'm sure you have heard
this I mean it's a very very popular
foundation it's beautiful there's really
not much to say about it it's a great
foundation it has no SPF in it and
that's why it is HD high definition
because when you have an SPF in your
foundation or under your foundation
you're gonna get white face in flash so
if you want to avoid that you want to go
something with no SPF which
brings me to max face and body max face
and body foundation is used on a lot of
sets with cameras and bright lights like
news anchors and celebrities they're
doing photo shoots it is a very thin it
is like 90% water I believe you're like
85% water so it's basically a tinted
moisturizer it is waterproof sweat proof
and literally like you can shove into a
pool and go like this and your makeups
not going to move it's insane um but
yeah great colors it's a great
foundation but you're going to need to
set with the powder otherwise you are
going to look very um like sweaty in a
way it definitely makes you look
extremely dewy just for concealers very
quickly
I personally my favorite concealers come
from Mac just I have tried so many
different concealers and I have never
found any no matter how expensive they
are that I love as much as Mac I have
tried drugstore I have a try Dior I have
tried Laura Mercier and Mac has just
they have the best cuz the others to me
I love their coverage and I love that
they're not really thick and most of
them don't settle on my lines so anyway
something that I really want to touch
base on because I see this a lot on
YouTube and it drives me crazy just
because a lot of people are giving false
information there are a lot of people
who use concealers like mac studio
finish concealer and Mac Studio skull
concealer which as you can see are in
pumps this one looks like an eye shadow
and this is a studio finish and then
this looks like painterly paint-pot
and this is Studio sculpt now these two
concealers are not for the eye area they
are not for around here I see so many
girls on YouTube using these for their
under eye area saying like oh yeah I
love this but it settles in my little
fine lines are there and like it's
really thick and every couple hours I
have to touch up and it's like no it's
not for your under eye area ones like
this after the under eye area okay like
stinks so I just want to touch on that
very quickly so that
that is why it's kicking up there very
thick consistency they are made for the
skin they are made for breakouts and
unevenness and red patches they are not
made to have to handle and sand against
these little lines that we all have
under our eyes so I don't want to know
try to stay away from that if you are
looking for something more full coverage
then use a concealer and then go over it
with a powder don't go out and get thick
thick concealer because it's gonna make
you look like dusty and dirty and no I'm
just against anything products on the
skin because we want the skin to look
natural and glowing and pretty not like
glue so now I am just going to jump in
to my foundation routine this is not I
said that wrong this is not my
foundation routine at all I'm going to
show you what I do when I'm going out to
achieve like a flawless face foundation
routine because my foundation routine is
super super simple um and this is simple
as well but I'm going to show you just a
few things to do just to help you get a
good looking flawless face night on the
town whatever you want to do a more full
full coverage foundation routine now I
can't even talk to you and I'm so sorry
about the Sun like beating in my face as
you can see I've just been like lounging
around the house all day hanging out
with John and now it's like he's gone
and I'm all alone so I always record out
like 7 o'clock at night ok so I am going
to be using the Makeup Forever HD
foundation today this is like my go-to
foundation when I want more full
coverage and what I do is I pump it on
the back of my hand like that just like
a whole pump and then i take the sigma
flat top kabuki brush what is this
called flat top synthetic kabuki the f80
this line of brushes from sigma is the
most amazing line in the world if you
don't know what Sigma brushes is they
are just as good as Mac they're the
exact same thing as Mac sorry Mac but
they are and they are online only at
Sigma Beauty comm I believe and you
cannot go wrong with these brushes so
what I do is I take my foundation brush
and I sifl it in there and then I kind
like push it like this because I want to
get into the brush because that's going
to give you more natural look now I'm
just going to take it and start moving
it around my face and as you can see you
can probably barely even see it but
that's what I'm going for because I like
to build my foundation I don't want to
just like throw it on there and have
tons of thick foundation now I may
notice I don't use a primer and that is
on purpose I do not believe in primers I
on
I think the primers are just more than
anything a gimmick now I put like a
little bit more on there I'm going to do
the same thing for the other side of my
face um unless you have special needs in
your skin and you know you're getting a
really good primer that promises to do
certain things like fill in lines and
stuff I just think that the basic
primers out there like Mac's primer and
steel is primer on benefits primer and
Smashbox is primer I don't see anything
that it does for me at all um basically
before you put on your foundation you
need something on your skin you can't go
on with a dry face because you will see
imperfections and you will see lines and
your foundation will settle and stuff
like that but that's because you would
dry a dry face you need to put on
moisturizer before and if you put on a
moisturizer even if it's I haven't found
a moisturizer for the three hours and
I'm putting my foundation and it's gonna
look good all night long you think
something on your skin that your
foundation can stick to and that's
basically the only point of a primer so
I just started out my rants I just don't
really believe in primers all that much
okay so
I'm bringing this and right now I don't
have like any really irritating
breakouts if I did I would go in with
the studio finish concealer right here
like I'll show you I would go in after
my foundation like I have a little guy
tempting me right there in this
concealer it's so thick that like if you
can see how thick that is putting it
barely any on it does even look like
it's my skin color because it's so
stinkin thick I cannot believe it so
yeah you don't want to put that under
your eye area and I go around my lips
not over them because this foundation is
not going to act for a primer um a lot
of people think that if you put
foundation on your lips it will make
your lip color like last longer it's not
true go get yourself a lip primer if you
want your color to last longer because
the foundation is just going to make it
cake up increase all over your lips and
you're going to get that like white line
in there now I have on the base the
foundation you can see what my skin
looks like my way too close for comfort
I have like whiteness around my eyes but
you can see it still looks like skin
like there's my little freckle you can
still see that and yes it looks like
skin it doesn't look like cake face
because the foundation itself I like to
keep it sheer um eyebrow my eyebrows my
eye filled them in already but just for
the purpose of the video I do that after
my foundation I just wanted to mention
if you go over your eyebrows with your
foundation it's okay if you do that and
then fill them in that will actually
help the color that you put on your
eyebrows stick and make your eyebrows
last longer I don't like talking so fast
and trying to get in so much information
so quickly I'm sorry okay tonight I have
that on
I'm going to go in with my concealer I'm
going to do a white highlight underneath
the eyes to show you guys because it is
very in right now and if you do it right
it can be done very beautifully so I'm
going to take NW 25 and a select cover
up concealer and I'm going to put a
little bit on the back of my hand now
once again this is like sheer concealer
so a little goes a long way so I'm going
to put that much on the back of my hand
and I'm going to take nw20 and I will
not come close to using all of this on
both of my eyes and I'm putting out
there and then I'm just going to take
any brush where's my concealer brush
okay so I'm gonna take my concealer
brush and I'm just gonna move this
product around like this and just mix it
together can you do that like going on
the screen okay so we have like a little
whirlpool of color there and then I
don't want that much my brush so I'm
just gonna rub it off like that so you
can see the color on the back of my hand
so I'm gonna grab a little bit of that
like sparingly and thin it out I don't
that much on my brush and now I'm going
to start in the inner corner of my eye
right here I'm going to zoom you in a
little bit I'm going to start in the
inner corner right here and drag it down
beside my nose and because this is sheer
I'm filling in the V that we're making
if this was a very thick concealer I
would just go like this and then like
this and I would just work with that and
make it work but because this is a sheer
concealer I'm bringing it
all the way in and filling in this V
okay so we want to bring it down right
here on the side of the nose you don't
want to neglect this area this is
important and I will explain more as to
why it's important in my highlighting
contouring video now I'm going to take
my theme I'm sorry I'm going to take my
finger and make sure it's clean I always
have like Purell or something to
sanitize my hand right mix but it drives
me out so bad so I try and seize it just
make sure your fingers clean and it's
the best if it's warm and I just take it
and dab it in um you can also use a
sponge for this I don't think that
brushes do the job because like I was
saying I like my under eye concealer to
be sheer and blended in and I think that
the finger does this better than any
native tool out there sorry it's like
hard to talk and apply makeup at the
same time even when you're doing
something like foolproof like this okay
so as you can see it is blended in about
quickly and it still does not look fake
obviously it looks a lot different on
this side and better than this side but
it doesn't look like oh god you have too
much makeup on okay so same thing here
going to off side the nose
bring it up
like as you can see there's I'm not like
precise with this at all
um I do get up under the eye pretty
closely and the reason that being is
because this is going to act as a primer
for eye product that I may put
underneath my eye so I make sure to get
up in there really good because after
this video I will finish my makeup if
you're curious the makeup that I'm
wearing is basically the exact same from
my neutral eye neutral smokey eye for
prom
whatever my prom tutorial the same is
that this is the makeup that I wear like
the colors that I wear every day in my
life um I take the product just surely
not that much and I just push it in this
area up to my brow because you don't
want that inner corner to be left out
and be discolored or have anything weird
going on in there don't neglect it and
see that'll bring like more popping to
my eyes now you can see what I'm talking
about
but see I didn't go in with a color
that's so like that you can't blend it
in because a lot of times I've got like
tons of stuff left over but a lot of
times I'll see girls go in with a color
that is too light and too pink for their
skin tone and they'll have like this
line right here that's like impossible
to blend and it can be really
frustrating so make sure if you want to
do this whole highlighted thing under
your eye area that you do it right and I
am using a color that has a pink
undertone yes um but it's not super
super light it's lighter than my skin
but only by like a shade or two don't go
lick six or seven shades lighter than
your skin because it's gonna start to
look really weird um
okay so now that we have that once again
if you have anything else you want to
conceal you can go ahead and do that
before you powder um like a lot of
people conceal around their noses
because women hormonal II get really
read right there um you can't escape it
if you are a woman and then around the
mouth a lot of times and then me
personally oh this is weird but I have a
problem area between my eyebrows I get
redness right there does anybody else
have that like am I the only one I don't
know why for some reason like my
foundation separates between my eyebrows
and retinas pokes out sometimes it's not
okay okay oh and I've had and
problem on my chin for like literally a
month like this guy keeps coming back
over and over and over on my chin I'm
like leave me along with it okay so I
back my hand now me personally I did not
powder my entire face because I am Drive
so I do not need to powder my entire
face if I weren't powder my face I'm
using translucent powder um I have Mac's
prep and prime translucent powders
that's what I would use but once again I
work with many translucent powders and I
don't think that there's one that's that
way better than the other but what I am
going to do is set my under eye
concealer because we don't want that to
move I've heard a lot of people say that
they don't set their under-eye concealer
because they think that it makes their
eye like their concealer crease more I
have never heard that in my life when I
was trained I was trained to set
under-eye concealer and I've always done
it and it's never my under I can see the
creases if I don't set it with a mineral
powder you can set it with a translucent
powder it doesn't matter I'm just going
to set it with this mineral powder this
is my favorite way to do it I don't do
it often though only maybe once a week
once every other week because if I use
this every day under my eyes it
irritates me it never used to but all
the sin of my skin start you're dating
me I am just dabbing it this brush is no
longer made by Mac kind of stinks I know
but any brush will do I've just used
this brush for years and I've hacked I
do not rather because if you rub you
were going to move all of that work that
you just did around your face so I've
had and I'm patting in the exact same
areas that we worked in and
make sure you get right here in this
area where that concealer and the
foundation meets now it looks like I'm
powdering that crazy but I'm really not
I just go over it like a lot because I
want to soak up like the moisture of the
concealer that I put on there and make
sure I really get it because I don't
want any of that area to be wet or
sticky because I want it to stay in
place just doing a foundation and
leaving it at that I do recommend doing
a little bronzing or some blush or if
you want to do like the whole
highlighting and contouring blush and
whole thing you can but I recommend
doing something otherwise you'll look
very flat and there won't be much
dimension on your face as you can see
it's not like a really thick base of
foundation it definitely gives like that
flawless look to the skin but it's not
like overbearing and cakey and for
people who don't like a lot of
foundation they're not going to be like
all as awful and Make Up For Ever
foundation I use this have a very
beautiful like velvety buttery feel to
the skin so I recommend it very much um
so yeah that is if you want another
video sometime in the future about me
showing a more like intense foundation
routine something that celebrities would
do or like a Kim Kardashian face routine
which is a very full coverage and a lot
of product I can do that for you but I
didn't want to jump in and teach you how
to do clown face first so um yeah I hope
you enjoyed this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
