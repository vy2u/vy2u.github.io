a makeup tutorial for you this actually
feels more like a get ready video though
because I am actually getting ready and
I have to leave my house right now like
I finished right on time
so yeah I am sick I woke up this morning
with a terrible sore throat hurts so bad
and probably have to go to the doctor
because it's just not good and I'm
starting to think I'm getting a fever
too which is just beyond typical because
I am flying this week um I am going to
New York City for a half business half
vacation I will be there for four days
I'm leaving on Thursday return on Monday
so it's like of course I'm getting sick
right now right so today is actually
Easter Sunday so I am getting ready I'm
leaving my house soon as I'm done with
this to go spend the afternoon with my
family for Easter so yeah I hope that
you guys enjoyed this makeup tutorial
it's very spring appropriate it's very
fresh I absolutely love this look I've
been wearing it constantly constantly
recently this is the same look that was
wearing in my favorites video that I
just did and so any of you were asking
what I was wearing if I could do a
tutorial so here it is I hope that you
guys enjoy thanks so much for watching I
love you guys and I'll see you soon bye
hello my love's the first thing we're
gonna do today is prime our face I am
using the makeup forever radiant primer
and I'm going to massage this onto my
face with clean hands you know the drill
you know how to prime your skin moving
on I'm going to use the Smashbox primer
water only because I was so dry from
being sick but two primers not necessary
let's get real I'm going to also go in
with the Kevin a Quan liquid highlighter
I talked about this in my most recent
favorites video this highlighter is my
favorite I'm gonna massage that all over
my bare skin just to give a really
beautiful radiant glow as the base then
I'm going to go in with Dior nude air
foundation I'm going to be applying that
with what you know
the Sigma f80 kabuki brush as always I'm
currently using the shade zero three
zero in this foundation and it actually
is a pinch too light for me but that's
okay cuz I'm going to go in with bronzer
and I'm going to warm up the skin and
add some color I would prefer my
foundation to be a little bit too light
over too dark any day of the week now
I'm going to be applying my under-eye
concealer and I'm using the Urban Decay
Naked weightless full-coverage concealer
I think I just nailed it I'm going to
just apply a little bit of it on the
under eye area and then also on the lid
as well and then I'm going to blend all
that out with a damp Beauty Blender a
tiny bit of this product goes a very
long way so as you see I do
not have to overuse it and this is my
favorite way to prime my eyes is to just
use concealer and then go over top of it
with a powder so I am using the
Anastasia banana powder to set this
entire area that's my favorite way to
prime and I am using the morphe M
five-10 brush for this I really like it
because it's kind of tapered and precise
and I really like it for that area now
I'm going to go in with the Chanel cream
bronzer I should have done this before I
set my under eye area I never recommend
using any creams after powders but I
wasn't feeling well so I wasn't really
with it that day so I forgot but if
you're doing this on your own do the
cream first and then set the under-eye
area so I am using the Sigma f80 2 which
is an angled kabuki brush to apply this
all over the cheekbones the forehead the
temples the chin I'm just kind of
bronzing not contouring now I'm going in
with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eye
shadow and I'm using a sigma e40 brush
to blend this back and forth and
windshield wiper motions in my crease
like I've said before Peach Smoothie is
my absolute favorite number one
eyeshadow of all time I basically can't
do any makeup look without it it's just
perfect for a nice transition shade now
I'm grabbing makeup geek cupcake on that
exact same brush I'm going to dust this
right underneath that color back and
forth and windshield wiper motions from
inner corner to outer corner and then
I'll blend it upward as that product
kind of disappears from my brush I will
start going up like you see right now
just to make sure that everything is
blended together and we have no harsh
lines now I'm going to go in with makeup
geek latte this is kind of a reddish
medium brown color and using a more
precise brush this is the e25 from Sigma
I'm going to put that lower in my crease
area so as you can see I am no longer
kind of blending upward like I did with
the other colors I'm kind of blending
onward onto the eyelid if that makes
sense as you can see right here then
I'll go back with the Sigma e-40 and
blend everything out once again with
absolutely no additional product on that
brush
now I'm taking makeup geek chickadee
this is an oldie but a goodie this has
been one of my favorites for ever and
with just a touch of that I'm going to
put it in that upper crease as well a
lot of people are fearful of this color
because it's orange and it can look
crazy but if you use just a touch of it
it adds such a beautiful glow now I'm
going in with makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow this is in the spotlight this
is one of my absolute favorite shadows
ever it is so beautiful it is such a
gorgeous beaming highlight
shade for the lid I am using a Mac 242
brush which is just a flat shader brush
to apply that all over the lid you can
use your finger for this product that
works really well what's great about
these is you get no fallout which is
like my favorite part so once I put that
generously all over the lid I will go
back with the Sigma e25 and just kind of
go over the edges that way there's not a
distinct harsh line to where this shadow
starts then I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows I'm using a Nastasia brow Wiz
in the shade taupe I'm going to skip
through this really quickly though
because it's not so fun to watch in my
opinion now I'm going in with Mac embark
I love embark this is one of my colors
that I just have to have from Mac it is
a go-to color for me it's a super dark
rich kind of purpley brown and using an
e 15 from Sigma I'm going to just press
that really tightly on my lower lash
line not too generously because I don't
want it to be too dark and smoky then
taking any pencil brush and a little bit
of that same latte color that I used on
my upper lid I'm going to just blend
that out making the goofiest face of all
time I'm going to go in with Mango Tango
this is another shade from makeup geek
such a pretty kind of orange e pink I
love this color and I'm just going to
put a little dab of it on that lower
lash line as well just to give some more
dimension now I'm going in with a creamy
ivory eyeliner and I'm going to line my
waterline to really open up my eyes and
make them look very fresh and springy I
will list the one that I use in the
description bar down below now I am
applying mascara so I am prepping my
eyes for lashes we're going to be going
in with my absolute favorite which are
wispy sweet nothings by velour lashes I
love these because they look beautiful
with or without eyeliner they're not too
over-the-top for my face and too
dramatic but yet they're still super
girly and they make a statement now I'm
going to go in with makeup geek blush
man it's a makeup geek day I'm going to
be mixing a rendezvous and spellbound to
make a really kind of purpley pastel
pinky cheek I have been loving loving
this color of cheek recently for spring
it's just so girly and dainty and super
feminine now I'm going to be doing
something that is so unnecessary and I'm
going to be using two separate
highlighters these are both by Becca and
we are going in with opal and moonstone
and I'm mixing those two together just
because I own them both and they are
absolutely gorgeous when combined so I
am using the morphe m50 one brush to
place this all over the tops of my
cheekbones my keep a bow
my chin and then I'm also going to use
these shades to highlight the brow bone
as well I am again using the mac 242
brush to highlight the brow now I'm
going to go and of course with mascara
this is mac gigablack lash this is my
favorite lower lash mascara I know it
seems high-maintenance to have a
favorite lower lash mascara but I do now
I'm going to go in with colour-pop
lippie stick in the shade OST a
beautiful baby pink and I'm going to top
that off with a NARS gloss in the shade
glow pink which is coming very soon in
their spring collection so that is a
wrap on this fresh spring makeup look I
hope that you guys enjoy thanks so much
for watching as always I love you and
I'll see you soon bye guys
so all my bad pictures I could see a
