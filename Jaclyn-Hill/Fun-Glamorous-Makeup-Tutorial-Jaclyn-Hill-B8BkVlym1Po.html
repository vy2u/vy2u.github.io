doing this really fun girly night out
makeup tutorial this is basically just
an excuse for me to wear glitter I love
glitter so much I cannot get enough of
it
any chance I get to pack it all over my
eyes I will do so just dip me in hours
and drag me pure glitter and I would be
happy I love it so much but this is a
very easy way to do it this can be very
elegant and glamorous this isn't
something where you're going to cause
attention in a negative way where you're
like oh my god no it's gonna be just so
it's very subtle but very pretty it's
gonna look gorgeous on everybody and
also my birthday is coming up in just a
couple of days so I won't be around
YouTube for a few days I'm sure because
I have a bunch of family coming in town
tomorrow to celebrate with me so yes and
because of that I think it's another
excuse just to wear the glitter okay I
will talk to you guys soon I really hope
you enjoyed the tutorial bye I'm going
to start off as always by priming my
eyes I am using Mac Pro Longwear
concealer shade nw20 as an eyeshadow
primer this has a built in technology
not to sell into fine lines and wrinkles
and it's also full coverage so it's
going to go in and cover up any veins or
blood vessels that you might have so
you're going to have a completely clean
slate base to start with so that nothing
it peeks through your eyeshadow then I'm
going to go in with makeup geek Peach
Smoothie eyeshadow this is replace my
Simone Samoas silk eyeshadow by Mac
because it has such a pretty yellowy
base to it so I'm just going to dust
this with a big fluffy brush this is an
e25 I believe by Sigma I'm going to dust
this in the outer crease just as you can
see really sloppy you just fluffing it
around and I'm also going to bring it
into the inner crease as well I'm
starting on the outer corner to get the
most definition there but I'm going to
swipe it in and windshield wiper motions
into the inner crease as well that way
the next color just just kind of blows
everything out this is Mac texture an
oldie but a goodie it used to use it all
the time
now I'm going to go in with a goat hair
fluffy brush for the outer crease this
is more of a dense brush so it's going
to get the color a little bit more
precise this I'm keeping it just on the
outer corner don't mind while I get
distracted and
please my eyebrows this is an everyday
occurrence and I'm going to continue to
just go back and forth in little
circular motions just in that outer
crease with texture then I'm going to go
in with another makeup geek product this
is one of the pigments they're pigments
are amazing this is called afterglow oh
my gosh you guys if I can rave about any
pigment right now it is this it is so
amazing I've been using it on every
client brides everyone it is beautiful
absolutely beautiful so again it's gonna
use a sigma brush this is my brush said
been raving about saying that it's
replaced my Mac 242 it's the best
synthetic synthetic brush for packing on
color all over the lid I love it so I'm
going to keep this color low I do not
want to take this above the crease I
want to keep this just on the lower part
of my lid and I'm not taking it very far
in the outer corner either I'm just
keeping it in that inner crease to mid
and a little bit towards the end and
then I'm going to wet my brush with that
pigment on it with fix+ I'm sure you
guys know you can do this with any
pigment or even a loose eyeshadow or a
shimmery eyeshadow you can wet it with
something like mac's fix+ or a setting
spray normally water doesn't really work
you can use eye drops and it'll just
intensify it and give it a metallic e
shiny look so I just like doing that for
a pop of color in the middle of the eye
and then I'm just going to use black gel
liner this is as always my Maybelline
blackest black gel liner I love it to
the death and I'm doing the wing as you
can see if you want to see a more
in-depth tutorial on that I have an
oldie I will link it below then I'm
going to use the lower lashes this is my
absolute favorite pair oh gosh I forgot
the name I think it's strike a pose I
will put it in the link not the link of
the description bar below and first I
always always put mascara on my natural
lashes just because you want to be
really careful with these mink lashes
and you don't want to get mascara on
them so I do mascara first and then I
pop these on I always use tweezers to
get really precise and low so that it
doesn't look really fake then I'm going
to go in with my youth Saint Laurent
foundation I am only using this because
of the color right now
I'm going to also show you the L'Oreal
True Match Lumi I think that these two
are very similar and texture in the way
they look
and feel but you will see here in this
lighting I'm using different lighting
today because it was pouring rain out
and believe it or not it's like three
o'clock here but this is how dark my
house was so you can see in this
lighting actually the true color of my
skin I'm always telling you guys I
promise my foundation matches in your
all ik know your pink your foundation is
yellow but you can see here my chest and
arms that I do have more of a yellowy
base in my skin so this East Saint
Laurent foundation it's got a dewy
finish it's like a medium coverage I
would say and it matches me perfect
right now because I'm not really tan
then I'm going to go in with Mac Pro
Longwear concealer in nw20 same
concealer I use to prime my eyes which
is why I love it so much because you can
use it for anything priming concealing
covering up you know pimples blemishes
whatever absolutely love this concealer
using a damp Beauty Blender and I'm just
going to buff that out under my eye area
make sure when you do this step that are
you are pulling this color all the way
to the temple if you are going to
highlight like I am and also make sure
you get the inner corner of your eye as
well because a lot of times if you miss
the inner corner of your eye you will
then look higher because you'll have a
dark shadow by the corners of your nose
and then I use the excess and Pat around
in the t-zone area just to give that
more lightness too otherwise you'll have
darkness down the t-zone and that's not
cute I'm going to go in with two Mac Pro
highlighters this is emphasized and it's
senshu eight I'm going to use both of
these combined because I don't want it
to be really stark white so I'm going to
use both them together once more pinky
once white I'm just going to Pat this
under my eyes with a fluffy brush and
just make sure you don't use too much
because this can get really white really
fast so I'm just dabbing all so that's
my husband in the background you guys
get scared sometimes when you see a
figure moving around it's just the hubs
then I'm going to use Mac mineralize
skinfinish and shave medium and just
cover the rest of my face I don't cover
all the areas of my face I think I
talked about in my foundation routine
but I'm just covering the t-zone because
I don't want any of my foundation to
move I'm not doing it for oil absorption
or anything like that then I'm going to
use a Nastasia brow is this is in the
shade soft Brown and I've been filling
in my brows very very lightly recently
well at least for me this is light
because I went through a phase where I
was just bad to the bone and filling
them in like I was walking down a runway
well not anymore
just filling in the outer tail and then
go in with a spoolie and I just kind of
buff it all out to make it look a little
bit more natural I just like the way
this looks especially for summertime
it's just a little bit more subtle and
then I use the Anastasia clear brow gel
best brow gel on the market is
absolutely phenom
I'm a z-- balls if you're going to own a
brow gel spend the money get this one
then I'm going to go in with shroom
favorite highlighter of all-time for Mac
I use it on pretty much everybody up
until you're about an NC 42 in Mac
foundation shades this is the highlight
I use on everyone beautiful cheek
eyeliner - then I go back with the brush
and just kind of buff over it because I
don't want any harsh lines of that
highlighter because that is not a good
look when you step out in the sunlight
and you see that intense line of
highlighter then I'm going to use Bobbi
Brown's bronzer whoo and golden light
and I'm going to use the NARS brush that
I have talked about so many times some
of you are still asking for a video on
this brush and I really need to do it
but I just get distracted with tutorials
but I'm just going to carve out my
cheekbones with this I keep it pretty
low back on the face I don't I try not
to bring it really far forward I don't
like that really intense contour where
it comes all the way to the side of the
lips I think that's very dramatic and
you'll take it a little too far and it
will begin to look and feel like stage
makeup so I put on on the outer portion
of my face and then I buff it out and
then with a bigger brush because I don't
have time to sit there with this tiny
little precision brush and sculpt on my
forehead please let's get real buffing
it out with a big Brush then i'm going
to use mac blush in peaches this is such
a good blush i have loved it for years
and years it is a beautiful Coralie
blush absolutely gorgeous I'm using a
Mac 129 short handle brush I always use
this for myself personally for some
reason it's like one of the only blush
brushes I own in my personal collection
I love it and this is the mary lou
manizer by the balm this is a
highlighter for the cheeks one of my
favorite highlighters it's more of a
white gold highlighter if that makes
sense it's like the medium highlighter
where it's not super gold but it's not
so
we're silver it's right in between and I
used a big brush to buff that on come
Sedona lace and then I'm going to go in
with the same color texture from Mac and
a pencil brush underneath my eye I know
it's strange I actually don't look at
myself in the mirror when I do this part
I always find it strange when I'm
watching the video I'm like why aren't
you looking at yourself but don't be
afraid to buff it on then with any brush
you can put another highlighter in the
inner corner I'm using shroom I think
this is very important for the next step
which is taking any glitter this is
urban decay glitter and it matches my
nails this is in Midnight Cowboy I
believe if I'm wrong I'll put it all
below and I'm going to get this really
tight and dense in my inner corner and
you want the most product to be in the
inner corner and then as you drag out
it's going to fit fade so almost hombre
so the most intense glitter needs to be
in the inner corner and as you drag it
out you kind of lightly let up on the
skin so that it's not as intense and you
can see a close-up of what I'm talking
about here and this is a nice way just
to give a pop where it's not too much if
you want to make it more you can bring
it up on the upper lip you can wrap it
around the inner corner and bring it up
by that eyeliner and kind of flicker it
out there that'll make it more intense
but I like it like this then I'm going
to use Lime Crime lipstick and coquettes
this is called I love lime crime
lipsticks like no other oh my gosh they
are so opaque they are beautiful you
guys absolutely amazing and they smell
so good and then I'm using bonnie belle
lip lights and strawberry parfait I
found this at I don't know where I found
this actually I don't know where I found
this but it's a nice shade it's a nice
pretty pink shade I'm going to put that
over top to finish off this look and
after that you are all done I really
hope you guys enjoy the video let me
know what you think about my new
lighting and I will talk to you soon
mmm bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
