today's video I'm going to be getting
ready I thought that would be a chitchat
and get ready with me video today
because honestly I have just missed
sitting down and talking to you guys so
much here on YouTube I've been really
active on my other social like Twitter
and snapchat and Instagram I have a sat
down on camera and Doug's like a chill
video is so long and I feel like I'm
going to know people like you think the
videos mean why should you to be going
in such a different direction and it's
just so high speed and so intense and
like sometimes I kind of forget to take
a step back and I kind of watching
someone whoa what's happening you know
like I don't even know how really keeps
up with it anymore and literally sit in
front of a window right now with no
lighting zero which feels so good oh I
got like a mild burn on my back when we
were on vacation and Turk and holy crap
like it is still so itchy - whose phone
gold I'm going to go ahead and prime my
face you guys I feel like I have someone
to talk to you about I can't I don't
even know where to start because the
past couple of weeks actually the past
couple of months correction the past
year I've been the busiest most insane
of my entire life
like I don't even know how to keep up
with myself at this point
but I took my first ever real vacation
with my family to the Turks and Caicos
which is the most beautiful place I've
ever been in my entire life great
sentiments like that many like amazing
dream destination spots but still I
think that it was like just so amazing
and the people there on the island were
some of the sweetest people ever like it
was just the water was so clear and so
blue and it was so relaxing it was the
best five days of my life like I've
taken vacations before in the sense of
like I take it like three day girls trip
to Vegas like that's not like a vacation
you know I'm saying that you're in Vegas
and you're like partying and drinking
and staying up all night and hanging out
their girlfriends and like you come home
and you're exhausted and like you need
to get like a hydration IV but like this
was an actual vacation like it was
absolutely amazing so now there's two
topics that I wanted to touch on
especially because they're the two
topics that people are absolutely
about and one of them is someone's Kim
Kardashian and the other is me and Jon's
new house let's talk about the min of
Kim Kardashian first because I know that
there are so many questions and obtain
so many people are asking me like was
she nice in person how was she and as
you can see in the video yes like she
genuinely is so sweet and so down to
earth and so kind and like when I was
driving to the studio I was like very
very calm I kept saying like I'm nervous
that when I see her all the citizen was
going to come over me and I'm going to
get my food like starstruck because no
matter who it is it's like an a-list
celebrity or it's just someone that you
stand around reality TV show or a
youtuber when you meet them so I'm kind
of just kind of like oh is it so weird
if you just get like kind of like or
taken by like emotions at least I do I'm
a very emotional person but sometimes
you feel it's so weird you like oh my
god this is actually there right now it
was just weird to see someone on TV or
on youtube or on any screen and meet
them to realize that sometimes you don't
really know what to expect so I don't
expect out of it I feel super calm right
now but what is why I mean who wouldn't
I to start with fangirling and freaking
out like I know I don't trust myself she
was so sweet and my very first
impression of her is that she is so tiny
I swear to God I could put her in my
pocket
her waist and her legs are so tiny like
her legs are smaller than mine like her
thighs she's so tiny just so like
adorable
her skin beautiful in person absolutely
beautiful um yeah and she was just so
kind she's so sweet to me she's my mom
immediately we walked back into like the
little set room and she grabbed her
makeup wipes in started wiping off her
makeup and she's like talking to me and
she's like you know I don't I don't ever
do stuff like this like I have no idea
like what's about to go down like I'm
not a youtuber so on so forth and so
like I was kind of talking her through
all of it she was so nice like asking me
so many questions um kept telling me how
she was like just feeling a little
nervous I do this on camera because you
know she was just a normal girl and as
far as the actual filming part of the
actual video that you guys saw I
definitely learned a lot in that
experience
before we actually started filming the
woman behind the camera I don't know
like what her name would be like the
producer director I don't know there's a
bunch people there and they told me that
they needed me to carry the conversation
on there like Kim obviously has never
done it just before anything like this
like are you comfortable carrying the
conversation and making sure that like
things are flowing and I was like yeah
totally which I am comfortable with that
because obviously I still YouTube videos
but as you guys know you're like a
subscribers in my channel and don't do
any collab videos like I live in Florida
I don't live out in LA by everybody who
is always working on collapse I'm out
here by myself I don't really ever film
collab videos so till all so much
collapse Kim Kardashian and then be told
like oh yeah you need to take control in
mission what the conversation keeps
going I was like but I put that pressure
on me and I wish I didn't because it
made me definitely feel a little like
like nerve-wracking on camera and I wish
that I would just like screw it like
it's fine like let's carry the
conversation so therefore I thought that
I was like overly hyper and I felt like
I was like interrupting her when I saw
the footage and it really bothered me to
see me act like that I'm like really
Jack and like get it together you know
like just let her speak but I want to
hear what she has to say but I in the
moment just felt like okay keep the
carthesian going keep it something like
and I don't know I just
and also I was not the one who was in
charge of editing it like I did at the
video and have the raw footage myself
people there the studio and you want to
edit it and so they didn't put a lot of
things in the videos I wish they would
have because we had like two hours of
footage and there was so many things
that Kim said sort she told and
conversations that we had that I know
that my subscribers who have loved to
see so when they didn't put those out
kinda like man you know I'm like she
made a bunch of funny jokes I don't know
I'm just saying overall the experience
was incredible and getting to actually
meet her and see how chill and
down-to-earth she was incredible but I
wish that I was her not the pressure
myself and act a little bit different
the footage but you know what you live
you learn the only differences most
people don't have their learning
experience with Jim Crow next year but
she's still liking my pictures on
Instagram so I'm like maybe she doesn't
hate me I don't know because all these
comments were people telling me like oh
my god work interaction I would never
speak to Jacqueline again I was a really
bad bad so next topic let's talk about
my house because if you follow me on
snapchat or Instagram and then you may
not see that I announced last night that
me and John are officially homeowners
which is you guys every single time I'm
not kidding we've owned the house for
like eight and a half months but still
every sometime I talk about it I I start
to cry that I can't handle it it's just
so okay anyway so let's just let's talk
about this house what I'm literally
sweating like talking about this place
get so emotional so excited I can't
believe I'm so blessed I get to actually
be a homeowner if you guys have followed
me for a long time then you already know
that being a homeowner like me and John
being able to have like a big house
where my family and my friends I'm gonna
start crying John stop it's just it's
always been a dream of mine my dad like
when he left I for some reason felt like
this need to pick up that slack and yet
had been through therapy for this I know
I got daddy issues I know my flaws but
that's just always been one of my dreams
me and John have been on the hunt for
our perfect house for literally I'm not
kidding it's been over two years at this
point and when I say on the hunt I'm
talking on the actual hunt like we have
had realtor looking for us constantly
has gone through a couple of different
realtor because we just we couldn't find
anything I mean actively looking for the
past two years like me and my mom are
Saturdays would go out we would look at
six seven eight different homes in one
day like emails constantly coming in
constantly on realtor.com costly I'm
Zillow just constantly costly costly
trying to find a house because me and
John has never thought of this condo
we live it as our home ever it's never
felt like home to us like it feels if
we're renting a condo but me and John
have not wanted to settle on something
that isn't perfect and I know that
perfection doesn't actually exist but I
just knew that when we found our perfect
house we would walk in the front door
and we would know you know as we just
did this is it anyways John and I were
getting just like very frustrated with
the whole house-hunting thing and at one
point we threw our hands up and said
like you know what it's just not going
to happen right now it's not in God's
time like it is Allah is moving on we're
not buying the right house this sucks
but we are constantly praying like
before when Bethenny and John always
pray given a sign something like what do
we have to do live we need that we need
a home you know so then back in November
John actually had his had a seizure his
one and only seizure thank you God
just say now that had been eight months
since John had a seizure I can say like
wholeheartedly that it taught us so much
and we are actually both thankful for
what happened because of the fact that
it has changed us in ways that are still
embeddedness eight months later so we
are very grateful for what that
experience taught us you know it's a lot
of perspective but anyways after the
seizure happened we basically lost hope
you know I'm like what what is what is
this like what is God what is life what
is everything like we just went through
a moment not a long moment but a moment
of just like frustration and is pure
heartache and just like what's going to
happen next
like waiting for all these tests to come
back for several weeks waiting to see
what was wrong and just like it was just
scary and it was for crappy time so
about a week and a half after John's
seizure my sister she tells me like hey
Jacqueline this house just popped up
it's a new construction and I think we
should go look at it and I'm like no
Rachel at that point I was just like I
don't know what's going out of my life I
don't know if my husband is going to be
okay I don't I don't know I don't care
like I'm not in the mood God doesn't
even know that I'm alive right now I'm
not focused on me my anxiety is
miserable life is my depression is bad
like we're just not in two places and I
was like no I don't care my suit
basically dragged me out of the house
and like we're going to look at this
house and I really want you to see this
so John stayed back me my sister my mom
went and looked at the house and jealous
like you go look you go be my eyes you
we know what you think and no joke
except one slide to the front door of
this house and just yeah not sounds like
preachy but in that moment like I just
felt like God would like I got you I'm
kind of like literally do my brows to
the tearing it was just like the best
timing ever
john cedars put so much into perspective
for john i and then all of a sudden it's
like we were three boarded with this
beautiful home we could only dream up
and it just felt like okay now we're
ready now we're ready to move into this
house now we're ready to start this new
journey of our life like it's just been
amazing so when we found the house it
was still constructions like plaster on
the walls and stuff you guys have to
wood floor because never finishes
moldings the size of the moldings the
countertops is guest pick out and
raising in the house so it kind of felt
like we built it even though we didn't
build it if you know what I mean
but it feels like us and it is literally
perfect it is our dream home to my
niggas I'm talking I need to calm down
so the house just got done being fully
built just a couple weeks ago and we
just finally closed so we just got the
keys like a week and a half ago right
before we went to Turks and Caicos on
vacation but I can wait if I got homes
like tell you guys because I wanted to
go and relax and just celebrate just
life and my family on vacation and come
home and then deal with this so now John
I are going to be officially moving out
of the condo in 12 days from today
Hyundai we are counting down to calendar
each day I'm going to go in with some
creamy matte bronzer this is it look bag
has been doing recently I use a little
bit of foundation my G cream bronzer as
a highlighter I do a little powder on my
under eyes like in mascara cuz it's just
so easy in when I'm not talking your
ears off but I'm actually focusing I can

actually just got tweet right now it's a
nice for me to get ready with me and if
you guys have any questions for me and I
can answer them as I'm finishing getting
ready

babbling okay oh my god this guy in blue
again today is a crazy Becca asked what
was your favorite part of a vacation and
hands down my hair part no questions
asked was doing nothing it was amazing I
don't know how to do that like I
struggle with a lot of anxiety like I
know I've been very open about like my
struggles anxiety depression all the
jazz I have dealt with and been
diagnosed with in my life
but I actually still go to therapy twice
a week for my anxiety because it's just
an ongoing thing and I just kind of come
to terms like you know what it's
something that I deal with it doesn't
make me who I am
it's not the end of the world so what
it's a side effect of life it doesn't
matter you know and it is what is what
being able to actually truly relax while
on vacation was amazing like just being
there zero anxiety to doing nothing and
not doing guilty was just paradise is

hired and interior designer based in
Florida her name is Michelle Miller

so much
and you guys will actually be slightly
like Wow surprised by the route I'm
going as far as design in my house it's

done in the past but don't get me wrong
it is like blingy blingy blingy bling
bling bling you know I want it so glam
and but I'm bringing a lot of ducks into
my house it's a lot of blacks and a lot
of deep colors and a lot of deep pieces

crap it is like the best you guys know
that I am like so fighter died for the
original L'Oreal voluminous carbon black
but this is the only one I have been
using it since I tried it it is amazing
the brush looks a lot better than sex
mascara which I'm not a fan of the
better than sex mascara by Too Faced um
because just make my last very very
clumpy but this on the other hand it
doesn't pick up like as much so it gives
me like a lot of volume but it doesn't
make my lashes clumpy so I have been
obsessed with this another amazing one

should I do it what a lot of people
don't understand until you actually know
me is that I do not actually give a tiny
rats ass about the fame and the money
that YouTube rings I do not care and for
some reason people like to think that
like that's all I care about and it's
just so amazing but honestly you don't
know what it's actually like until
you're in someone's shoes and that's
just not my heart that's not my soul
