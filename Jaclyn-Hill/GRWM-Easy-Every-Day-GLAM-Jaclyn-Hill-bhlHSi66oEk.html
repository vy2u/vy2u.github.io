probably good morning for all of you
watching but it is definitely a good
morning for me the Sun actually just
rode like maybe 45 minutes ago so the
lighting is coming into my windows right
now so I thought that I would turn on my
camera and record a get ready with me
because today I'm going to put it
gardens with my family with Gardens is
an amusement park here in Tampa really
really popular I'm sure some of you have
heard about it up
I'm really tired my brain is totally off
right now I got literally woke up brush
my teeth took a shower and that's it
mouse in here I've been away from maybe
20 minutes my allergy built afraid this
time of year it's when I wake up in the
morning my eyes are red and small and I
put an eye drops up and my face are like
puffy like my entire face when I wake up
is so swollen my eyes are puffy my face
is puffy and might even my lips are
puffier like it's crazy in the morning
my lips are bigger and plumper and then
within an hour and I go down it's like
their regular size but I'm like so
school my first wake up from allergies
anyways for today's video it's not going
to be super duper exciting this is why I
see just my everyday look don't mind me
I'm going to spray this um this is
called the Rita hard on root concealer
touch-up spray I have my shade brown
black dark brown flash black and I
literally just spray this right here on
my hairline in the morning before I do
my makeup um cuz I do it afterwards it
turns into a total mess but I do not
like my hairline so the hair anagon gave
me so Rita has on gave me a product like
that yeah I don't think today is not
going to be a super duper exciting video
because as you can see I'm just sitting
here with a puffy face and a very deep
early morning board um I'm going to just
be doing my kind of everyday makeup
looks throwing together and they have
both that I do all the time when I'm
leaning in a house this is not like it
every day just like tend to moisturizer
and concealer well don't get me wrong
I'm going to do lashes I'm going to do
something glam but it's going to be the
easiest glam possible with the most
minimal steps possible to save time
because this is the look that I run to
on a weekly basis let's just change it
first I'm going to prime my face to see
LLC pearl radiance primer today even is
one of my faves I'm also going to go in
with the Smashbox photo finish primer
water ice be sculpting that's what this
stuff like I think I don't do to bottle
and I just didn't ever go back to the
Perth arena but Smashbox said if you
have top it was fun okay one more for
good health
Smashbox spent a PR package like a week
go within about a week ago we did ago
but it was like this big box feels like
all their primers and I was in there and
I was like oh my god
when we have is this stuff why I stopped
using the first place so I thought that
I would give it a world again and see if
I still like it
okay so for today I'm actually trying
the new holidays but the D or your skin
forever Foundation recently I've been
hearing so many incredible things about
the foundation and my friend has been
obsessed with it so much you know what I
need to try it so I went out and I
bought a couple of shades and I actually
put on yesterday for the first time and
work for maybe like ramen Oh 20 minutes
so I actually am really excited to try
this foundation again today for real and
like give it a fair chance because it
looks like it's going to be really
beautiful for the go ahead and throw
this on the face I'm going to use my Rao
synthetic kabuki brush this is the
morphe and 4 3 9 and buff it into the
skin it definitely it goes on like a
sheer to medium coverage which when I
was applying it yesterday I was like oh
god I got my because I'm definitely a
full coverage kind of whore
too early for for not the funcomfortable
chocolate gets covered i presenting that
it has a very very natural finish to it
not yui and it's not a chalkboard map
for sure i'm eating a little bit more on
a little bit more a smaller brush this
is the morphe e 8 just because there are
certain areas i want more coverage so
i'm going to go in with a more precise
brush and just get the covers I desire I
never film videos soon as I wake up in
the morning like it feels so different
but now that I've got my camera
equipment
with my pain why not I thought about it
last night forever tonight all the
sessions wake up before everybody else
and fill a video before we go out for
the day because typically I wouldn't
even put makeup on or something like
that like went to an amusement park like
those of you who meet me in person know
like when you meet me out persons there
is a 98% chance that I'm not gonna have
any makeup on or whatsoever that's just
how I do because for me
typically I'm either going to be full
beat or I'm going to look like I just
like a cast member of walking dead I'm
going to grab this heart-shaped tape in
the shade medium because I do have a
spray tan right now my friend Jackie
spray Musa my gosh I absolutely love
having a friend who knows how to spray
tan and she just comes over like she'll
just text and do it hey girl I'm a mile
away from your house wanna tan I'm like
yes please
I am so obsessed with this beauty sponge
it's the one I showed in my first
impressions video is the new one by
morphe that once I had pointed in one
side how this is shut neck I'm upset
like my other Beauty Blender I even know
where it is I don't even know I works I
try this one the other one is retired
okay honestly I'm shocked right now my
skin looks like a baby back like it
looks like it did what I was born where
are we we are doing color
tarus chocolate have your brains wake up
I make myself coffee before senior in
front of the camera nothing and when I
make myself coffee every single morning
I haven't an espresso machine and I make
myself decaf I like myself a decaf iced
vanilla latte every single morning I'm
up huh if you guys make your own coffee
at home I would really highly recommend
the Nordstrom coffee oh my gosh I'm
going in with the Giorgio Armani on
luminous book powder the only one that
matches me right now my spray tan
but you're some coffee and you can buy
online pretty sure if you own one or two
next to you trust me when I say it is
the best coffee in the world like it's
even better when you go to Nordstrom and
get it like every time I go shopping at
Nordstrom I have to have to have to go
and get a decaf iced latte because holy
guacamole like it
so good that I sip it and cherish every
single stick because I drink like a
gallon of it it's the best coffee ever
I'm freaking out right now my skin is
like like a baby's at people like a
baby's ass I'm going to go in with the
Alexis red and color pop highlighter and
wronger look like this I use it my first
impressions video and I quickly have
fallen in love with it
and I actually use this bronzer as a
shadow basically on the daily now
because I love the color of it it's such
a beautiful with norm undertone like
orange a base runner I know
orange is not like the colors you want
here when you think of Roger but having
that undertone and it really just give
you so much warmth to face kind of
summery glow so I have been using that
as I shy of the past week or two and I
loved it onto being natural daily basis
and then I'm using our 37 which is a
morphe brush where it's from the rose
gold collection this has been one of my
favorites the past couple of weeks just
from this initial color right here which
I'm not doing anything else
say like as you're going to see my
eyeshadow application is gonna be easy
peasy lemon squeezy
I'm just popping this in the crease area
and then just like basically whatever is
left over my brush is kind of blending
it everywhere because this doesn't need
to be perfect it can be a little messy
it doesn't matter like we're just
keeping this casual just an everyday
casual kind of like the little sexual
glam a matte Brown and I'm going to
going in with my Jaclyn hill morphe
palette look at how dingy this palette
looks there's lashes stuff all over it I
have been using and this bad boy right
here for oh my god this particular one I
would say five months I've been using
this so it is really normally it will be
coming soon you guys all in due time
but I'm going to be grabbing a tiny
brush and a matte Brown I'm going to be
going in with a pretty dark matte Brown
we get have you got my brush and all I'm
going to do is just flicker this on just
the outer part of my eye only on my
lashes just right there and then kind of
go back and forth and slightly blend it
upwards just for a little added
definition so the
don't look super duper naked this will
just give a real something-something
I'm going to go back in with that
bronzer that I use initially and I'm
just going to align that on my lower
lash line okay with that same dark brown
it's going to pop that right on the
lower lash area just moving on the outer
corner of the eye because on a
day-to-day basis I'm doing something
super smoky I really don't want to bring
a lot of depth anymore because it can
just make my eyes look kind of small and
B so I like to keep everything dark more
on the outer portion of the eye to look
more awake and fresh and then I'm just
going to blend a nap back and forth and
downward
all right I'm going to put some mascara
on my upper lashes I'm using the Loreal
voluminous carbon black because it is so
black and I love it when my favorite
mascara I had to put on literally a
bathrobe Oh old Oh Lord is having really
chilly weather right now and it's like
twister temperature it's currently 53
degrees which is freezing for us and my
health will not warm up my house is
currently 65 degrees so I'm really
really gold I am going to be applying
lashes today I'm going to be using the
sweater lash and the style intoxicating
because these are my personal favorites
like a glam situation I freaking love
displaylist
as well like I want something like boom
boom today so I'm going to go with
intoxicating lash while I'm leaving my
last glue to dry I'm just going to
highlight my banal ball really quickly I
can find a brush that's suitable for
those I'm going to go in with the Oprah
highlight in the shade Beverly Hills and
just mix the two last ones together this
one and this one need to be careful with
these because they are so ultra creamy
that if you like put just a little bit
too much pressure on it with your brush
it will destroy the highlight I saw that
Nikki is collaborating with Oprah's
coming up a highlight and I cannot wait
to see it because I really have been a
fan of this Beverly home won by Oprah so
I can't wait to see what she has done
like what is that that highlight is no
joke I'm going to start off by applying
this lash coming downwards everyone is
always saying how flying laughs are so
hard and it's really not you to come
downward set on top you can see it's not
secure at all then I will close my eyes
and I will just place it right there
don't use tweezers do as I say not as I
do
there's tons of last application tools
you can use that are much safer than
tweezers but I just do it stretch a
rebel
okay while I'm letting the lash glue get
tacky on the other lash I'm going to
apply some white eyeliner in my
waterline this is the Mac eyeful in the
shade fascinating
we put the mascara on my lower lashes
I'm using the Mac extended at play and
gigablack lash because it is my favorite
mascara for the lower lashes it just
gets every single lash so well okay so
now with the state I'm going to do it
with the same rocker that I use on my
eyes and I'm going to just grab a
bronzer brush this is the morphe R 2
which has been my obsession I love this
Roger so much you guys and it's so
inexpensive it's just so beautifully I
can use it what I'm really fair or I can
even do here how much I'm like I am
blending so hard on my shaping in my the
Meo that when I really yeah
no but seriously I can use it when I'm
really fair and then I have my free time
right now if I'm pretty much the darkest
that I get and I can use it at this
color as well which I love it I love
that I can use it when I'm super light
and when I'm super dark well not super
dark but you know when I've got my pan
my version of super dark I'm not kidding
you guys this brush is everything don't
sleep on it I'm so obsessed with this
brush it's one of my favorite bronzer
brush is like you know I'm still
committed to my contour bronzer brush
like come in it but for example like I
wash all my brushes what oh gosh it's
like a full two weeks and this is still
clean I haven't even used it that means
that on a day-to-day basis I am
genuinely reaching for this one over my
town for which is so weird
maybe just a fade I just love this I
love how it applied I love the shape I
love the bristle like I'm just obsessed
okay now that I did that my eyebrows
look crazy I'm going to just go ahead
and glue them into place with some clear
brow gel I'm going to be using the and
it's not the one I'm just coming through
them first and then get those brows
locked and loaded up my heart is racing
you can go ahead Busch Gardens today and
we're leaving in an hour and we know
that my friend is gonna try to pressure
me to go on ride roller coasters and
such a baby
but I used to love riding roller coaster
so much you guys oh my god I would do
anything it doesn't matter how high
minute matter how intense the drop was
or how many times you went upside down
like I was just like an adrenaline
junkie and I didn't love more culture I
would go over it over an over front row
and something happened when I was like I
don't know 19 20 21 like in that time
period where I just developed this fear
but it sucks they still want to do it so
bad I'm like okay I didn't it's like
I'll do certain rides like I can't do
the really big ones anymore because I
will go into a full-blown panic attack
but they might in joking when I go to
push Gardens today I'll take my little
backpack and my pack will be filled with
my essential oils because there's a good
chance that just looking at the ride
will literally give me like real anxiety
now I don't think I got a number looks
real anxiety like it freaks me out in
John he will do anything but he'll do
the biggest scariest roller coaster in
the entire world he said oh my god that
down there I'm going to go back in with
the same highlight that I use on my brow
bone I'm going to pop a little bit of it
in that inner corner because I can't
leave apps out of there for a highlight
I'm going to combine this and this this
is the Oprah blush palette I use in my
first impressions video and I have been
using it recently little while since
I've done like a baby doll pink cheek
that paint I'm really dying to try this
Tom Ford highlight right here and I know
that people are going to be pissy with
me because how expensive it's called the
sheer highlighting duo reflects guilt
but this swatch likes me on another
level and I'm dying to try it I just saw
it in the mail yesterday like I bought
it from Sephora I bought a couple of
things I'm super excited to try this to
the say hello to sexy like illuminating
fluid oh my god a swatch on my arm last
night
it looks gorgeous okay oh my god
can't forget the little melody no no
okay I was not expecting it to turn such
a highlighted situation but hi how are
you we have arrived
I'm going to just grab this lorac Pro
contour palette I'm going to go in with
this yellow highlight shade is a matte
powder can I take a little bit of it up
and put on my under eye my under eye
does look a little dull and her side and
I just want a little something under
there and trying to find on a brush
that's going to make me happy
for lips I'm going to go in with the
colour-pop ultra satin lip in the shade
likely once yesterday like 20 months and
I loved it
the color is so pretty
all right member setting spray I'm going
to be using be tatcha luminous dewy skin
mist they sent me in this bottle it's so
beautiful this is what the standard
packaging looks like and you can see it
at the very very end of line break down
there I've gone through so many bottles
you guys I can't I'm going to use this
to spray my face I'm going to avoid my
eye area because it does contain oil so
it will make your mascara transfer like
if you like open with your eyes really
wide or it look down it will make your
mascara transfer to your face and your
eye area so I'm going to cover up that
area and rip to my cheek let me make
sure that it sprays out really
okay alright you guys that complete it
is a video as you can see it's super
easy like yes it's will be yes it's full
and yet there's a lot of steps but it's
still like it's pretty easy to achieve
this here I'm saying
kind of like the lazy girls guide glam
oh did I just come up with the title
look about thing I did hmmm
yes that should be the name of my
channel even though I'm not lazy I have
no problem spending three hours being
safe but still I would like that name
this foundation literally it looks like
I don't have pores and I am fine with
that
alright I'm gonna stop talking I have to
go out the door in 45 minutes which is
just enough time to make myself some
coffee
shut up and put in my mouth and get
dressed and hit the road so thank you so
much for watching and he outed me this
morning I love you guys and I'll fuse
mmm bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
