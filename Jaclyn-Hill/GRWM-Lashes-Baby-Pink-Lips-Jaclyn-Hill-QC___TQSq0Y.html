doing a very quick get ready with me I
am genuinely getting ready I was
actually contemplating if I should even
film this or not because I have to get
ready really really fast these I have to
run to some meetings then I have a
dinner tonight so I have kind of like a
look in mind that I want to do
I um I snapped a makeup look that was
wearing a couple days ago and I wonder
something similar to it cuz so many of
you guys were asking me if I could do a
tutorial and it's honestly so simple it
was just a very dewy highlighted kind of
summery pale neutral look who's kind of
a long description for such a simple
look right anyways that isn't that my
go-to look recently I absolutely loved
it it's kind of like fading out the
summer for me because I know very soon
I'm gonna be jumping into the fall
trends and I'm gonna be like dark berry
lips and vampy intense eyes so I'm
really liking kind of pale pink nudish
looks right now so that's what I'm gonna
do today because it's so easy and it's
so quick um I wasn't wearing lashes a
few days ago on my snapchat I am going
to apply lashes today just for like an
extra what because I'm going to dinner
tonight if I see an intense
I apologize I am very tired and I've
been running on empty for the past
couple of days as you guys know I've
just been so busy out of town and stuff
like that and I'm not complaining very
blessed to live this life but it has
been draining and I actually attempted
the film the same video when I was
getting ready yesterday and the video
just turned out to be such a hot mess
because I've been dealing with migraines
race I don't ask like what thoughts okay
cuz I'm gonna go to the doctor tomorrow
and hopefully he's gonna find out what
is going on but in the meantime
definitely affecting my mood because I
mean migraines are no joke I have a lot
of sympathy for people who suffer with
migraines because this is the first time
I've experienced it and it is not easy
to go about your life so yes doctor
tomorrow that's gonna be good I'm gonna
walk you guys through the steps in this
video with me as I am getting ready but
if I happen to miss a product that I am
using or if I just get caught up in the
moment and I'm just talking talking
talking and I am not telling you what I
am using every product in this video use
will be listed down below in the
description box tape first things first
I'm going to prime it my face and I am
using if you make it forever step you
know what
I should be using something more
hydrating today no I'm going to no many
something smoothing the reason I say
that is because my skin has been so dry
recently it has taken a beating from all
the traveling so the past week has been
pretty much as me everyday trying to get
my skin back because it has been so dry
and so flaky and I've been breaking out
so much because of all the traveling I
took five flights I take five flights in
11 days so yeah my skin was not too
happy with me I'm just going to touch a
luminous dewy spring calm gone Java
that's expensive I'm gonna be using it
be cover FX natural finish oil-free
foundation but this is in the shade G 50
and I am NOT shade g50 I'm like shady 40
and I just ordered it from Sephora
yesterday so I'm waiting for to get here
I'm so in the meantime I'm just going to
mix a liar foundation with it it's going
to mix a little bit of the new Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD foundation just like a
pump this is like really light so it's
going to mix a pump just for the
purposes of lightening the shade
foundation this foundation is really
thick like really thick so if you're
looking for full coverage this
foundation will be bomb for you it does
have a dewy finish um I'm gonna go ahead
and add a Beauty oil in it as well just
because I really want to do the do today
I'm going to use the blissful body
Beauty oil this is the miracle Beauty
oil and serum I have not talked about
this on camera yeah I don't think that
this is ridiculous how amazing this
Beauty oil is me and my mom are both
obsessed so I'm just going to take a
pump of that any beauty oil or vitamin E
oil that you have anything like that
will work I'm going to put a few little
drops and then make a little cocktail on
the back of my hand
I could use a cocktail right now
Jacqueline it is 10:00 a.m. and get it
together oh so yummy in you only optimal
I was gonna dot that on my face I'm
gonna spray a little bit of fix+ on my
brush and of course i'm using the morphe
m4 3:9 and i am just going to buff this
into the skin I do not want like heavy
cake face today at the post other days
where I do want heavy cake
I want to apply this more on the light
sides I wanted to be very like minimal
and fresh and glowy gosh even with the
beauty oil even mixed with the makeup
firmer foundation this coverfx
foundation is no joke it is so thick I'm
going to be using the Real Techniques
version of the Beauty Blender what is
this called miracle complexion sponge I
just got this in the mail last night
I am ride-or-die for my beauty blunder
when it comes to my under-eye concealer
so this is so tiny cuz it's dry um but
I'm gonna try this one cuz I know that
tons of people love it and many
especially has been tiny that I really
need to try it so lost trying this is a
big deal okay you guys I really love
that you you better I am going to pack
this concealer on today
some days I'm going to move for less
concealer other days I'm in the mood for
more don't judge me
we went in with this concealer today yes
give it to me okay
now I'm going to use the Real Techniques
sponge and see what this is all about it
doesn't have as much squish as the
Beauty Blender I don't know how I get
about this fun you guys on the side
decide oh that's nice I like this side
because it can get right up under that
eye area like yes begone dark circles
well like that it's like so flat I just
packed it out but the pointed end is as
pointed as the Beauty Blender but I like
this this is nice
I'm just going to run this over my face
just to pick up any excess foundation so
we are not cakey I'm going to be using
this new palette that I was so excited
about I just got this in the mail
yesterday this is the NYX highlighting
contour palette and I honest-to-god
haven't heard pretty much anything about
it which makes me kind of nervous like
is it this is gonna be I have no idea
but we're gonna find out I'm gonna use
the lighter shades to set my under eye
area I get so nervous when I use new
products like this because I'm like if
it sucks then my makeup is gonna sell
day but we're going to give it a shot so
I'm going to mix the light shade in the
yellow shade together I'm going to
look at the light shade just a little
bit of yellow shade I love it this is
nice now I'm going to go in with the
eyes and I'm going to be using the
morphe 35o palette I'm sorry this is
sold out you guys but it's going to be
back very soon and I have had an insane
amount of requests for a tutorial on
this palette so I will be doing an
entire eye look using the morphe 35o
palette very soon and i will be the
first to let you know when this is back
in stock okay I promise second it comes
back I'll let you know and also all
social media platforms kind know so many
of you guys are dying to get this
because it is it's amazeballs there's
nothing else to say about it triggering
raised goals and I would use something
else but honestly this is what I have
been using almost every single day
recently so I'm just going to keep it
real with you and I'm going to use it
today I'm going to take this shadow all
the way over here on the right hand side
that's like my right you're like
whatever I'm gonna take that shot right
there and I'm going to just buff it into
my crease area I'm not going to do much
shadow today I'm going to keep
everything very light and well I'm going
to use two shades now I'm going to take
the morphe and 5:02 brush and I'm going
to take this pale orange shade right
here which I love the shade I'm probably
gonna hit pan on the shade quick because
I have been using it almost every day
I just love pale orange shades because I
just think they bring so much life to
the eyes because it just brings like
this warmth and this light to the eye
area
and then I'm going to grab award though
I'm going to grab my Mac Pro emphasize
powder which is usually the powder I
always use right here to set my under
sorry not flipping you off to set my
under eye concealer but I'm going to use
that as an eye shadow on the inner
corner of the eye
I started doing this when I was in New
York when I was in New York for my meet
and greet I pretty much forgot like all
of my eye shadows and I was like what am
I gonna do
and so I learned to use this setting
powder as an eye shadow and I have been
loving it ever since and using it as an
inner corner highlight like crazy now
I'm sorry I keep forgetting to talk I'm
just like trying to hurry and get my
makeup done so I can get out of here on
time because I am not late like I am NOT
one of those people who runs late if I'm
late
I start to panic and freak out I'm
always on time so even if it means I
show not looking good I'm gonna be on
time I'm so Monica like you know it I am
I am Monica Geller Monica get her now
I'm gonna move on to the eyebrows and I
actually I bought a new route hold on hi
oh I can't find it and I don't have time
to like look conduct I have so much
makeup in here right now it's so insane
but yeah I bought the new NYX brow
pencil and I really really want to try
it but I'll try it next time I do eye
makeup so for today I was gonna stick
with the same thing as always the
anastacio brow is I use the shade taupe
the big thick brow Tran just honestly is
not for me and sadly it took me a year
to have to realize this situation but
you know it's one of those things like
when trends are going on everyone feels
like they have to jump on board and be
like oh this is a trend so I have to do
it but sometimes we need to take a
moment to take a step back and look and
be like is this trend really right for
me you know I'm saying like whether it
comes to makeup or anything in life any
sort of trend because there's just
people out there setting these trends
you don't saying we don't have to follow
them but with this big thick brow trend
it looks so beautiful on so many people
and I felt like I had to have these big
thick luscious brows in order to like be
on trend and look the part but I
realized recently like they're just not
for me they make me personally look
masculine and mannish and that's not the
look I'm going for but for some reason
I've just been doing it for so long and
so I decided to thin out my brows a
little bit and stop filling them in so
intensely and go with a little bit more
of a natural looking brow because it's
just not for me
I wish I could pull off that thick brow
because I think it's so beautiful but
it's just one of those trends that
doesn't work for me and I'm okay with
that
I'm gonna highlight under my brow bone
and my favorite highlight ever for the
brow bone is Mac nylon it used to be Mac
shroom but times are changing people
tons of jaded Mac now is my absolute
favorite it is the frosty frosty is
highlight ever if you are trying to find
a highlight that is multi-purpose for
everything the brow bone inner corner
even the top of the cheeks Mac nylon
eyeshadow you can see how frosty is when
you apply it to the brow bone it's
intense so I'm just going to apply it at
the high point and then blend downward
and then that's it I'm not going to put
it all over the entire brow bones I
don't want it to be like a zebra stripe
of highlight I just want it to be a pop
at the very high point of the brow so
let me grab my bronzer oh wait my
brother's right here I need to get
together let me grab my bronzer brush
I'm going to be using the makeup forever
three five one bronzer this has been my
favorite brands for quite some time now
I overly use it it's my obsession I
guess every single day I would say it's
a rare occasion where I use anything
else because I just love it so much it
just blends it so easily and beautifully
on the skin like buttah I'm going to
concentrate this towards the back of the
face meaning I'm not going to put it in
the center of the face I'm going to
concentrate it all around the edges of
the base
now for blush I am going to be using the
morphe 9b palette which i've raved about
in the past and i'm what shape I want to
use I want to do is kind of pinkish not
I'm going to use this shade right here
kind of a corally pink I can never get
over how intensely pigment to this
palette is don't worry girl I'm going to
blend that out okay now I'm going to go
in with the Kevin of Kwan celestial
powder and the shade starlight which is
a really kind of light pinky highlight
shade but it's too pinky for me to use
as an actual highlight on the tops of my
cheekbones so what I'm going to do is
just brush it brush it over where's my
thyroid run I'm going to just brush this
over the apples of my cheeks just to
give a nice kind of like babydoll glow
right on the apples and so I'm just
going to dust that right there on the
apples of the cheek you can see the
highlight as opposed to this cheek I'm
going to coat my lashes with some
mascara first of all so I can pop on
some false leads
okay so I'm going to be using Lily
lashes in a style Miami I have been so
in love with Lily lashes recently it's
ridiculous the style Mykonos is my
absolute favorite style ever Mykonos
lashes and then house of lashes iconic
are my two favorite lashes at the moment
Mykonos is really like very intense and
definitely not the look I'm going for
today so I'm going to be using Miami
my mascara my lower lashes real quick
I'm going to highlight the tops of my
cheekbones and I'm going to be using
champagne pop of course and this is
actually really exciting because
champagne pop is going to be a part of
sephora's hot now products which starts
on August 27th which is basically this
video was going to go up and it's going
to be on their hot nail products lists
until September 30th so if you are still
trying to find champagne pop it is going
to be in your local Sephora on August
27th so yeah so crazy
I'm using the morphe m50 4 brush to
highlight which is just like a tiny
little tapered precision highlight brush
I'm going to just put it right here on
the tops of my cheeks
now for my lips I hate to do this to you
guys but I'm going to be using a color
that is not available yet it's a shade
that I am testing right now so I'm sorry
but I have to test it today because I
have to make a decision very soon mmm I
love me a baby pink what do you guys
think of that color be honest don't lie
me okay now I'm going to just set my
face using Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray are you guys that
completes this get ready with me video I
hope that you guys enjoy I honestly
needed to do this video to get my what
do you call it I was going to say get my
sea legs back but that does not apply in
the situation but just get my groove
back it's been so long since I've been
on camera especially with a nice camera
I finally got my camera and sitting here
in my normal background in my normal
routine talking to you guys I really
needed to get back to this cuz I've been
gone for so long and just so busy and
this is just my happy place I love doing
this and I'm genuinely happy to be
sitting here and not talking to you guys
even though I'm rushing and I have to go
out to a meeting so yeah thank you for
having me here honestly I don't care if
