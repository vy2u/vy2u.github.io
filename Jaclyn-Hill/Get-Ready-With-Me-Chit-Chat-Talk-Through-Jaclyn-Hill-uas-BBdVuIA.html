something that I've never really done
before I actually haven't done this
before but I need to get ready for the
day and I thought all my camera
equipment and lighting was set up so I
was like let's just sit here and get
ready today so I'm going to be filming
myself getting ready for the day and I
thought that I would include you so this
is not actually a makeup tutorial and
the look that I'm doing is like super
kind of simple everyday makeup look I
have in mind
so yeah a lot of you guys have asked me
recently for like laid-back kind of like
chill get ready with me videos because
all my tutorials are so like high-speed
so I figure this was a perfect
opportunity so grab your makeup brushes
get a cup of hot tea and let's get ready
together a couple hot tea sounds really
good I'm actually gonna go get one hold
on I'm back and can we talk about my mug
honestly I know you know how when you're
younger you play house as an adult I
play friends like I said on my couch and
I act like an essential part and I'm
like oh god there you silly bitch I'm
just saying friends is life goals
literal goals goals AF okay let's get
started what is this in my hair it's a
price tag I'm not for sale
smelly cat smelly cat what I feeding you
I'm gonna be starting with my eyes and
I'm gonna go in with the lorac Pro
palette and I'm going to use one I'm
gonna use this shake nectar right here
and don't mind my nails I'm getting them
done tomorrow I was actually supposed to
get them done today but I'm not gonna
have time I'm gonna go in with nectar on
this Sigma e-40 this is just a nice
pinky rose transition shade I've been
really into wearing different shades of
pink on my eyes recently like makeup
geek cupcake I have been obsessed with
that shade just because it's such a nice
kind of neutral tone baiji pink I just
think it's so pretty for spring and
summer I get asked all the time if I
have permanent eyeliner tattooed to my
bottom waterline and no I don't the
reason is sometimes you will see like a
lot of black down here is because the
day before I was wearing a smoky eye or
I was
wearing black liner on my inner
waterline and then at night I purposely
don't scrub my lower lashline too hard
to leave a little bit of that eyeliner
right there in my lashes and that way
the following day I don't have to do as
much work on my lower lashline if that
makes sense
tricky tricky I'm going to use Bobbi
Brown toast because this is like one of
my favorite all-time transition shades
it's like the color of skin with just a
little bit of warmth in it just gonna
kind of lightly brush this all over the
lid area I went to anthropology two days
ago and I found the cutest stuff I know
it's so random but I haven't been in
that store in so long and I have one
right next to me and I got this pillow
that I'm like in love with isn't this so
cute I'm trying to bring more gold into
my house because it's so much silver and
white and I want it to be silver white
and gold so I love this pillow it's like
Kate Spade because she's like all gold
polka dots but I absolutely love it and
then these scissors I know this is so
random but how cute are these scissors
like I die I'm going to use a Mac Pro
Longwear eyeshadow this is called
uninterrupted oh my god
if you've been around for like ever on
my channel back in the day I used to
talk about this all the time and it's
still one of my absolute favorite colors
ever I've always said it's like the
color of baby puke but like who doesn't
love the color of baby puke okay let's
get real
okay I'm going to apply eyeliner and I'm
using Maybelline gel liner and blackest
black of course what's new it is
physically impossible for me to talk
while I'm doing my eyeliner so now Rina
bollocks
I wasn't expecting my lawyer to be this
thick but it's happening so we're
rolling with it
okay so to clean up my eyeliner I'm
going to take a I makeup remover and
this is just from Sephora and then any
angled brush this is a Nastasia brow
brush technically what I'm going to do
is just take this brush and just wet in
the tip of it with a makeup remover and
then I'll just go and sharpen that line
and this will just erase any eyeliner so
that you can make both wings look
identical to each other if you've
already done your foundation and
concealer at this point then you can do
this exact same method instead of makeup
remover just put concealer on your brush
and then just go ahead and erase it that
way for lashes I'm going to use the new
of a lower style these are called its
shelf fluffy I love that oops
I forgot to promise scare out what was I
thinking Oh whatevs
it's happening life goes on oh these
lashes are so bored right now look at
man look at that lash honestly can I get
a yeah now we are going to move on to
the face so I'm going to prime my face
I'm going to use a makeup forever
step one radiance primer this is just so
lovely I'm gonna try a new foundation
today that I have not tried before and
I'm really excited about it I you saw
kathleenlights using this foundation a
while back and I found it on ASOS comm
online I know that's random but I was on
their website just like looking at
clothes and I was like why so I bought
it I don't even know how to pronounce
this foundation honestly bourgeois I'm
assuming bourgeois Paris healthy mix
serum foundation it says 16 hour gel
foundation radiance boosting even
revived complexion okay
is anyone else really excited for this
week's Keeping Up with the Kardashians
and let's just dip a question because I
am NOT a big Keeping Up with the
Kardashians person like I I don't keep
up I always have the e-channel on those
so they will play in the background but
like I'm not someone who watches it
every Sunday but I will be watching this
week's because in the preview for it
it's like all about Kylie Jenner's lips
and I'm really anxious to see if she's
going to like come out
and admit to having lip injections or
fat injected or whatever the heck is
happening in this region on her face
oh there's going to be like I overlined
my lips I'm just waiting I'm very
curious okay so I sprayed it fixed Plus
on my f80 kabuki brush from Sigma and I
was going to pick this up on the back of
my hand and let's see the dealio Oh
perfect match
yells oh yes even out that skin tone you
bit it out okay now I'm gonna go in with
Urban Decay Naked skin weightless
concealer my lover oh there's something
so magical about applying a concealer
and once you start blending it out and
you see that unevenness and those dark
circles disappear is there's something
so magical about that moment now I'm
going to set my under eye concealer eyes
always I want this under-eye area to be
bright today like I don't want any of
this like close in at so cloud like I
really want this to be bright
okay now I'm going to fill in my brows
I'm going to use the Anastacio brow is
in the shade taupe taupe is like
technically a color for blondes but it
is what I personally like for my brows
because it matches my natural brow color
perfectly so that way I don't have to
like go really intense and fill the
entire brow and I can just kind of go
like here and there and it just looks
natural with my brow hair
I am so excited for this weekend it's
Mother's Day weekend and I have a big
surprise planned for my mom and I
obviously can't say what it is because
my mom is one of those moms that watches
every single video that I upload so she
will see this but I am so excited I can
barely handle it I'll probably share
some of it with you guys on snapchat so
but you guys can experience it with us
but I've been planning this for a long
time and I can't wait I'm going to take
a little bit of Mac nylon just to
highlight my brow bone nylon is like my
favorite highlight of all time it is so
intense Mac nylon is really frosty and
really intense highlight but it's
beautiful if you use a little bit of it
and it's also gorgeous as a cheek
highlight so I'm thinking about possibly
doing a master bedroom tour because I
have so many requests for a house tour
and I just don't I don't know I just I
don't know how I feel about a house tour
it's just a lot showing your entire
personal space and I already put so much
of myself out there for the world to
judge and give me their opinions and I
just feel like my house is a very
special place to me like that's where I
go to rest and relax and rejuvenate and
I don't know if I'm comfortable like
walking through my entire house and
showing the entire world every single
little piece of my home um but I was
thinking that I could do a master
bedroom tour and show you like my
bedroom in my bathroom maybe as a warm
up and kind of see the response that I
get to that and go from there but let me
know how you feel about that about a
master bath master bedroom tour let me
know in the comments if that's something
that you would like to see or if you're
like screw the bedroom I want to see the
whole house because I just don't know if
I'll ever do the whole house honestly
this is a new makeup forever bronzer
this is called pro bronze fusion this is
in shade three five one I think and I'm
just going to use this big ol Sigma
brush this is not a Sigma brush this is
a Tom four brush wow it's time for brush
it's not necessary you do not need this
you
Sigma brush or a morphe brush no so
pretty love this bronzer I was going to
use this to warm up the whole face I'm
not contouring with it I'm just gonna
bronze with it this is so great
bathe thyself in bronze or I'll go in
with the Kat Von D shade light palette
listen guys I clearly had a very
hardcore love with this Center highlight
color like I want her just to make this
color and sell them in an individual
palette I want it so bad so anyways I'm
going to do is take this very light
vanilla shade right here on this brush
and then I will just take any brush it
doesn't really matter I'm choosing this
one but it doesn't matter what you use
I'll just take this and lightly put it
right there to sharpen up that area that
way that gives the face more definition
than just bronzing does because it will
kind of give you a little bit of a line
so it will look like a little bit of a
contour but just ever so slightly and
then blend that out and I'll just go in
this area and blend it out I have to
sneeze from that powder but my lashes
still on now for blush I'm going to use
this morphe blush palette this is 9b is
the name of this eye thing I'm going to
use this middle one right here you're
super pigmented so I really have to tap
off the excess on the brush I love it
like one tap you get so much bigger
so now for a glow I'm going to go on to
one of my favorite products right now
and this is a Kevin a Quan highlight
this is called the celestial powder in
the name starlight morphe M 501 brush I
use this brush for what I'm doing right
now and also to highlight the tops of my
cheeks this is like my favorite brush at
the moment so I'll just take that and
then tap off the excess and then put it
right on the center of the cheeks and
you can see oh that's glory like how can
you deny that how how they on the apple
of the cheek so beautiful I'm going to
take a tiny little precision brush and
go back in with more Mac nylon and just
pop that on the inner corner of my eye
for a little pop I'm going to make that
inner corner pretty bright today which I
don't usually do I'm usually very light
handed on this inner corner because I
just feel like it can look really
overdone with certain looks but this one
I feel like it needs it okay do not
sneeze Jacqueline do not sneeze I'm
going to line my lips with Mac
subculture lip liner I actually cannot
stay in the formulation of Mac regular
lip pencils I like their Pro Longwear
ones honestly it is so hard for me to
find a color that is a great just
neutral shade for any lipstick over top
and this is one of the only ones so it's
what I'm using
now I'm going to go over that with the
new gerard cosmetics lip gloss in the
shade Madison Avenue I just got this in
the mail about an hour ago so I really
want to try it cuz I have even swatched
it yet not quite sure when it comes out
but I will go ahead and put that
information down below it's such a
heredity color wow so pretty this is
such a pretty color I love that it's so
different than like what I normally wear
because I normally wear things that are
like so nude I love it this has like a
little bit of like a rosy brownish shade
in it but yet it's still nude this is so
pretty
YUM so here we have the final look very
bronzy very glowy which is exactly what
I was going for I love everything about
this look I love this look combination I
love this Kevyn Aucoin highlights I
could wear this look for like the next
month straight and you wouldn't hear me
complain alright you guys I hope you
enjoy this tutorial
get ready with me like hodge podge mess
of a video I don't even know what to
call this because at one point I was
like I'm just going to get ready on
camera and then I was like we're just
gonna make this a tutorial and then at
some points I was just like dead silent
so I don't know how this video is gonna
turn out but all I do know is that I
love this look and I hope that you guys
enjoy it yes it's nothing crazy and out
of the box and new and exciting but it
is just something that I could wear for
the next 30 days straight and not
complain like I love everything down to
the new lash style that I have on this
foundation Thank You Kathleen light to
the recommendation I love it
so far I love this Madison Avenue lip
gloss this is like one of my favorites
from Gerard so far so yeah I love this
look I hope that you guys enjoy it
super simple to achieve the only thing
that really requires the effort is the
winged liner button and that's super
easy so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this
hodgepodge of announced video I'm gonna
