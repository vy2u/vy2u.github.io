getting ready with me for a girls night
out I'm blinded by the light if you
can't tell yes I am still wearing
pajamas because who wears normal clothes
around the house I wasn't able to film
an intro today because I had to leave
soon as I got done doing my makeup so
anyways I am priming my eyes as always
this is an absolute must I'm using Mac
Pro Longwear concealer you use whatever
works for you but this is my absolute
favorite then I'm going to be going in
with my favorite eyeshadows of life
which are a makeup geek obviously going
in with Peach Smoothie as you can tell
this is very used very loved one of my
favorite colors ever I am using a e-40
from Sigma and I'm just going to dust
this all over that entire crease area
back and forth I have done this probably
5000 times here on my channel so I'm
sure you know the drill then I'm going
to go in with chickadee and that exact
same brush and just a tiny bit and
you're going to see I'm just going to
place it on the outer corner of that eye
and that upper crease and that's it done
boom just a tiny bit this color gives me
life I absolutely love it it can look
intimidating because it's very like
intense yellowy orange but it's gorgeous
then I'm going to go in with Coco bear
another favorite another cult classic
love it need it gotta have it if you
don't have it buy it now thank me later
moving on I am using an e 35 by Sigma
this is just like the 25 but just a
little bit longer and less dense and I'm
going to be applying that mainly on the
outer corner of the eye because I really
want to accentuate the outer corner of
the eye if you want to bring it in
that's totally up to you but I want it
to be the darkest on the outer corner
then I'm going to be going in with a Mac
pigment in the shade Heritage Rouge this
is such a gorgeous pigment it's this
beautiful purple color and if you wet it
with some eye drops or fix+
it completely changes color that was a
sneeze by the way I'm going to be using
a Mac 242 brush which is just a
completely flat brush which is my
favorite type of brush to apply a
pigment and I'm going to put that all
over the entire lid area all the way
from inner corner to outer corner and
then once we have that on the entire lid
I will of course go back and just blend
it out in the crease area I never walk
away just like that I always have to go
back and just blend it to make sure that
it meets perfectly with that crease
color and that lid color so there's no
harsh lines and everything is just very
smooth
and blown out I am going to just dampen
my brush with some mac fix+
again you can use some eye drops and it
will do the same thing for half the
price well less than half the price and
look at how it changes the color I love
this pigment for that reason because it
turns into like this amazing cranberry
pink color still beautiful for fall so
beautiful for fall wow I like stumble
over my words absolute gorgeous so I'm
going to let that dry just a tiny bit so
it's a little bit more tacky and not
soaking wet and then just kind of blend
out and manipulate that color all over
the lid to make it a little bit more
cranberry esque then I'm going to be
going in with another pigment yes I got
a little pigment happy recently at Mac
it is what it is
I also dampened this with some fix+ as
well and I'm just going to put it on the
inner corner of that eye and bring it
towards the center of the lid and up in
that inner crease I don't typically do
this but I just think it looks so
beautiful it gives the eye a little bit
more dimension and it just makes it look
more fun and that's what we're doing
tonight we're having fun so my eyes are
going to have fun too I am doing winged
eyeliner as normal except I'm going to
just bring out a little bit further than
I typically would typically I would
shorten my wing a little bit less than
this but tonight I really wanted to
extend that wing and just give it a
really sharp intense point as you can
see because I just think that it's
really fun and adds something to the
look I am a sucker for a colorful smoky
eye with an intense sharp long wing I
just think it's the epitome of glamorous
and girly and just fun I love it I'm
going in with velour lashes in the style
girl you crazy oh my god I love that
name you can see they are so fun they're
girly they're wispy and they're kind of
on the dramatic side I say kind of even
though for most people they'd be like oh
my god I'm going to be going in with
Giorgio Armani a luminous silk
foundation my absolute favorite I am
using shade 6.5 right now it doesn't
match my face but it matches my neck and
that's what matters to me I'm going in
with an M 439 foundation brush from
morphe I have been loving this recently
don't mind me there was something
happening on my computer and I kept
staring over at it that's why I'm
looking very distracted so blending this
all over the face and then I will fill
in my eyebrows i am using anastasia brow
wiz as always this is my favorite way my
favorite pencil my favorite ever
thing when it comes to eyebrows I have
been filling in my brows a little bit
different recently for those who have
noticed you're so observant and I am
thinking about doing an update brow
tutorial for you guys soon I'm going to
be highlighting my brow bone with the
shade nylon from Mac this has been my go
to highlight recently for my brow bone I
just think it's beautiful it is very
intense so it will last you pretty much
a lifetime it is a yellowy kind of
golden base so I just think it is so
gorgeous I love it it works for a brow
highlight and inner corner a cheekbone
everything beautifully I'm going to be
concealing conceal don't feel okay
honestly I thought wow I'm really going
light handed stay with my concealer and
then as I'm editing this I'm like oh my
god no I'm going to be blending that out
with a damp Beauty Blender and I am
using NARS radiant creamy concealer
which is one of my favorite concealers
ever that and Mac Pro Longwear they are
my go-to so I am doing AV motion with
that up towards the temple and then as
always I will set that with some
under-eye powder I am using a Nastasia
banana powder to set this under-eye
concealer for those of you who are
wondering what banana powder is it is
from her contour kit which I will put in
my description box down below with every
other product that I use in this video
after I have set that I will also put a
little bit of that on my chin and then a
tiny bit of it on my forehead just to
even out the highlight this is pretty
much a step I do no matter what look I'm
doing that way it kind of evens out and
it doesn't look like whoa intense
under-eye highlight and no other
highlight on the face I'm mixing cocoa
but bear and bitten both from makeup
geek absolutely gorgeous combination and
I am using an e 15 flat definer brush
from Sigma just to put that tightly on
that lower lash line all the way from
outer corner to inner corner I meet it
all the way up to my winged eyeliner on
the outer corner and then I bring it as
far and as you prefer I bring it pretty
much all the way into that inner
tear-duct though because I wanted this
to be kind of smoky and blown out and a
very round shape on the eyes with that
sharp liner sticking out on the outer
edge that's what I was going for then
I'm going to go in with amber lights
from Mac and I'm going to put this on my
lower waterline just with a tight little
precision brush because I didn't want my
waterline to be blank or white or black
and honest so you
I've never found an eyeliner for my
lower waterline that will stay put that
is a true absolutely gorgeous like gold
just a vibrant gold like this one if you
have a recommendation for me please let
me know because I absolutely love gold
on the waterline but I cannot find a
liner to do it for me taking that exact
same copper pigment I'm going to just
put that in the inner corner on the
bottom lashline as well to meet it with
the upper lid that way it kind of just
wraps around then I'm going to be going
in with my favorite part the glue I'm
using glitter liner from urban decay and
a shade Midnight Cowboy I like to use
glitter liner over loose glitter glitter
any day of the week because when you do
this it is not going to flake and fall
all over the face it's not going to get
messy on you and it stays put like glue
I wore this all night long and when I
got home I looked in the mirror and it
still literally looked the exact same so
I prefer using a glitter liner like this
as opposed to a loose for so many
reasons it's just so easy you really
can't go wrong now I'm going to bronze
the face of course today I am using it's
wait what am i using Smashbox suntan
matte bronzer this is one of my faves
and I am using a morphe mb5 brush to
bronze I've talked about this for the
past three or four videos absolutely
love this brush right now for bronzing
absolute incredible I will put my
discount code for morphe for you guys
down below if you want to save some cash
money if you feel like purchasing
anything from their website okay moving
on for blush I'm going to be using Mac
style this is a beautiful peachy orange
e blush with gold shimmer undertones in
it absolutely gorgeous
I wanted to pair it with this eye look
to kind of pull through that orange
color that I barely put in that upper
crease it's just very complimentary so
beautiful then I'm going to be
highlighting using a Laura Mercier
highlighter in the shade 0-1 again I'll
put it down below I'm going to be
highlighting pretty precisely with just
a small blending brush from morphe just
on the top of my cheekbones I'm not
going to be bringing it down too far
because we already have a lot going on
in the eyes and I didn't want the cheeks
to be overwhelming as well and I'm going
to put a little bit above that brow bone
this is a trick for those of you who
want to give a little bit more lift to
the brow just put a little bit of
highlight right above that brow bone and
that will kind of give you a little bit
more volume
I'm going to put a thin coat of mascara
on the lower lashes I am using Rimmel
accelerator this is from the drugstore
and is my favorite mascara for my lower
lashes I absolutely love it then I'm
going to be going in with NARS lipstick
in the shade Anna this is one of my
favorite lip colors ever right now I
wanted to do something other than the
typical nude with like a colorful smoky
type eye so I chose to pair this live
with it and I absolutely love it it is
so pretty so to top that off I am gonna
go in with a little bit of shimmer of
hope this is one of my favorite glosses
it is from girag cosmetics I just wanted
to make the lips a little bit glossy and
this will nude it out just a little bit
I didn't use tons of excited and give me
more of a glossy full lip effect ah love
that lip color so once we are done with
the face I will move on to my hair and I
am using a Bellamy 6 in-1 curler this is
the biggest barrel that it comes with I
will put the link down below for the 6
and 1 along with a hefty discount code
for you guys this is my favorite wand of
life I am telling you it holds the curl
no joke for three days I'm gonna go
ahead and change my clothes and I am a
good to go if you guys want to see my
full outfit I will link my blog post
down below for you without the details I
hope you guys enjoy I love you and I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
