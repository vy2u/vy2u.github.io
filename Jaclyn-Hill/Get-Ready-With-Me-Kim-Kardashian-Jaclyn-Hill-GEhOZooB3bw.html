for today's video I am doing a collab
video with this girl right here
miss Kim kardashian-west joining me on
my channel today this is not fair I got
sprayed last night by Jimmy Coco I have
my mommy and I still look better than me
okay i does it all
refusing her contour sticks which i
actually have not tried yet I'm really
excited I'm excited for you to try them
I told her I was like don't show me yet
I want to see it on camera get my real
natural first impressions we have my
palette here as well which excited to
use there's always head so I hope that
you guys enjoy this video and let's get
into it the first time I watched
anyone's tutorial or anyone's review
with yours
ever since I've watched anyone on my
collab with Kylie with the lip kit it's
so fun getting to know this whole world
how do you use this with Lee primer hmm
I don't really use primer Kim no this is
like it will make you like throughout
the day just look like so just glowy
throughout the entire day but keep your
makeup on and just like everlasting
doing this try hang it's really nice
massage it and like moisturizer it feels
go in your face though right yeah and it
doesn't steal I thought a primer would
feel a bit more like have like collagen
or something in it so it would leave a
film what's your favorite foundation I'm
telling them she's got George Romani
she's got luminous silk she got la
Prairie of course yes I'm using a little
bit of Chanel and a little bit of la
prairie foundation liquid done you need
to tell me something I actually like
wanted to ask you is how you got into
makeup in the first place like what age
you were like your first memory of just
like becoming a makeup lover I remember
always playing in my mom's makeup
Courtney and I just when we discovered
concealer we just like had concealer all
over our faces and looked so crazy I
mean we're really little so I'm really
I'm excited to see your concealing
situation I don't even know what
concealer color I use I use like this
little palette a dermablend palette and
I just kind of blend and mix
gosh you'd like the most smooth
under-eye okay that's very sweet
because I have filler okay so after I do
a really dry concealer I then use this
makeup from our I know that stuff are
you seeing that little a long time ago
so you do the dry like very pasty
concealer and then a creamy concealer
right our top yeah it's uh this is my
favorite Beauty Blender ever I mean it's
a beauty sponge it's not by Beauty
Blender it's by morphe but it is my
favorite one ever because it's a bigger
powder it's softer and it blends easier
and then this side is sharp so if I have
to get like right under there and if I
have to fake or if I have to bake my
contour it just it does it all it's my
favorite one
it's pretty white considering out tan I
am I really am you see how white mine is
right now can we please know what are we
gonna do because I'm not a professional
like Jacqueline I just wing it
I winged everything in life I am baking
a little bit okay so you're making me
forward you're doing cream contour okay
you were rocking my role right now can
we doing it backwards it's just how we
do it so I'm using I been eye fair look
at you
so Mario would die if he saw the
products that I had like he literally no
like no he does but there so our
old-school situation that he was
literally he can't believe that I use
and so I kind of keep the corner but I
kind of just blend like brush this off
just as I am going to do cream contour
so I don't want it to get all powdery
and you guys should know that whatever
she's doing take notes I'm going to
rewatch this footage later because
person in person looks amazing thank you
like on me zing when I do my contour I
always mix them you know you definitely
need oh yeah different shades finish
economy was like advice I'd bring it
down further on the darker side to pin
it up higher we usually use the medium
what I'm looking at exactly how you're
doing so I literally want to use it like
you use it but I can have like that Kim
experience oh yeah these are creamy on
application so I'm the dark I only
really use the lighter side just because
the darker side will be too dark for me
I'm literally like watching you I love
the little tip of your nose to do like a
dark tip of your nose
Riley often in this okay I like to
basically do like a three like this like
yes I saw you talk about that where was
oh you're just going to keep okay yes
pile-driving on so I'm going to do it
too I blend this in first before I put
the highlighter on someone else yeah
back to light
no because you want to start up later on
your nose especially if you've never
done it you have to start off lighter
and look either know it I'll might move
underneath them and it makes your nose
just look shorter I basically use the
little brush oh this brush is actually
like legit but I push it into my
hairline when I go around like this
brush is truly nice I think I could have
been even more generous with this
product it's such a natural product yeah
I know why you were like putting so much
on because it really is I'm taking that
honest this is really really really nice
like chili is so creamy I really wanted
to stick for easy application so I'm
using the matte highlighter okay I'm
just like literally following your steps
like a child just on my eyes so I
definitely wet the sponge and these
sponges are removable I like reading a
tiny Asia I really love it my every yeah
I didn't have this lemare bronzer no
okay guys so Jacqueline and I are going
to go to Twitter and answer your
questions while we're doing a fun
tutorial so write us questions on
Twitter I got my Kissin so quick what's
one beauty related thing that you have
done that she wish you never did mine
was my eyebrows hands down for sure I
had like sperm eyebrows for a minute and
it was not cute I have really thin
eyebrows too and it was it was I look
back and just a battery yeah I think I'm
just embarrassed that I would wear like
turquoise eyeshadow with like turquoise
clit like mix it all and match it was
like I'm wearing a hot pink shirt today
let me just like put some hockey shadow
real quick yes no I get that
what are your biggest goal for your
makeup brand to me I would think
everyone would think contours really
hard and really hard to do so I totally
also people like I'm not the best makeup
artist but it's fun for me and I could
figure it out and I've learned from the
best of people you know doing my makeup
so I just hope that it's a brand that
people find Yali user friendly really
easy and that everyone can do their
makeup and feel good about them and the
way you just like pull it out and do
everything you do like your face your
nose your eyes your lips you make need
and be like oh it's even easier than I
like play up in my head sometimes
because I'm like contour traitors too
much it's so intimidating and it doesn't
have to be it just opened up the palette
oh my gosh stop that's so crazy to see
that palettes like sitting here knowing
it's like a reality and like seeing you
actually hold it I want to know how you
use your palette so I can just copy you
because I my gosh I have so much do you
want to do like I like the same look we
can do it together yeah okay I'm gonna
do my shadow I'm literally gonna keep it
very basic like you have no idea I'm not
gonna use shimmers okay it's like this
literally in my crease back and forth to
the coffee this is a question I have for
you now even Twitter what made you
transition from going like so nighttime
smoky sexy Vava voom to now just like
this natural minimalistic that we've
been seeing recently I think it's
definitely a combination of being a mom
and you're not having as much time
because you just I don't have the time
to sit in the makeup chair for two two
and a half hours I really feel like I
changed my style but now I think I'm
slowly getting back to wanting to do
more yes I've been up a little bit I
mean I personally now I go into the two
darker colors under yes mm-hm tap off
the excess look at your little brushes
the sold great you do it in the crease
also get this second moving this down
place just say our plate and lower so
the exact same place and also like a lot
in here then what I do is I grab like I
need to find a brush just like a small
stiff brush and I put it right on my
lower lash line like this okay like
almost like eyeliner like really tight
your lashes are so long do you use like
a lash going pair out okay still I can
click it Armenian
are you kidding only my hair would grow
like that those are your natural lashes
you I mix everything I never use just
one color like I always go back and
forth that's why I creative palettes we
use several different shades do you
powder last where did you powder already
I powdered yeah I use a Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush powder my favorite how
you get bad in my eyes and I got it my
favorite under-eye powder it's the Kat
Von D shade and light palette and I use
are my eyes because it's so brightening
and I love it it's so smooth she's like
the creamiest powders ever what is a
nickname that you've been called since
you were younger do you have one people
don't really know this nickname but my
dad would always call me George so why
no one knows why my dad would always
laugh and I don't know why but that was
my nickname
jojje yeah there you go everyone knows
that my nickname was jackass was it
really yeah jackass Apple Jacks Cracker
Jack kinder mean it's prepared me for
YouTube in social media though totally
right you're wrapping it up and I'm
popping on my lash I mean I ought to do
is pop on my lash and then promise but
still okay so this is a good question
what made you one is almost video with
me I'm fascinated by how you have made
this whole career for yourself
just off of youtube and everyone
connecting with you and they're
connecting with you for a reason
and just there was I was sitting in
Mexico when I saw you open our lip kit
and when I was just in my room by myself
on my phone looking at Twitter and I
just saw your review and I could hardly
get service but yours loaded and so I
was riding like people get it and the
reaction like what's going on it was
like these few days of just being really
introduced to this world this world so I
just thought you know I wanted to do my
first one with you just because it was
like this moment when I was in a
different country and like I felt like I
connected to at home and what was going
on with my lips when I saw yours that's
not easy to me I mean it
like the fact that my first video would
create a tutorial of a look that you
wore like a Kim Kardashian inspired
