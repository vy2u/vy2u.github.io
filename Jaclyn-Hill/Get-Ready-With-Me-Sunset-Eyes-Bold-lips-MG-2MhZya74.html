Sifl like hello
how how how are you guys doing it has
been a minute since I have sat from this
camera it has been a crazy crazy week
oh my gosh but it's just getting crazier
so for today's video I'm going to be
doing a makeup tutorial for you guys
talk through get ready with me if I turn
to a chitchat video who knows
I saw this beautiful girl on the popular
page that what it's called I think it's
like the explore page now it'll always
he's a popular page to me i screenshot
in it because i was so inspired by this
picture her name is Amanda Selena and
when I saw this I was like oh yes
screenshot it just inspired me to play
with like golden highlights and purples
and oranges and corals and bronzy skin I
just love it she's so beautiful and this
image is naming it just so yummy and
luxurious so I'm going to kind of play
off of those colors today and just being
inspired by that so thank you to Amanda
Selena for inspiring it this look today
I'm gonna go ahead and just jump in and
stop rambling first things first I'm
gonna prime my skin do you guys like my
new background you know ya know I'm
using the Marc Jacobs is this the
undercover yes invisible undercover
perfecting coconut primer so bougie I
take a dribble of that and go ahead and
massage it in to my skin I love this
primer because it's so moisturizing
that's my favorite thing about it I mean
I don't really know if it makes your
foundation last all day long I've
mentioned that before about this primer
I just love that it just makes my skin
feel so moisturize and it gives my
foundation something to like hold on to
then what I'm going to do because
recently I have been battling some
texture and yes it has been a battle
tonight me against my texture I'm gonna
use it make it forever step 1 smoothing
a primer this is my favorite primer for
smoothing out the skin I know there are
like thousands of primers out there for
smoothing but this one is my favorite I
take it on my fingertips and I go
directly like in my problem areas which
is around my nose a lot of people have
large pores around their nose
is not just you it is most of the world
male and female this issue is always
problematic I'm going to bring it up on
my cheeks because that's where all my
issues are right now I don't know what
it is if it's my diet but my diet hasn't
changed I think it's stress though
because everyone's been telling me that
can be a really big cause of like
breakouts and bumps and texture and I
have been really crazy stressed the past
month or so so it could be that because
my guide is still the same Doritos and
doughnuts all day baby I don't mean that
couldn't be the cause of breakouts right
because I'm super healthy I'm gonna be
trying a bunch of new product I was a
boy but I'm gonna be trying some new
products today because I feel like I
always just get stuck in these ruts
right do the same stuff over over with
the same lashes and the exact same
channels and same everything so today
I'm going to be using new stuff and I
got this new our teeth brush sent to me
it's the Ely collection a mirror finish
palm brush so let you hold it in your
palm like these and you apply your
foundation and I have not used it yet so
we'll see how it goes for my foundation
I'm going to be using the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD stick foundation I'm going
to do a stripe on each cheek chin and
forehead and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to finally finally be using
the Loreal there's a L'Oreal valuable
Pro glow 24-hour wear foundation it's
going to go ahead and start buffing this
in oh my god this brush is so beast mode
my word like oh my god this is like so
big that's what she said and this brush
like just is so huge you can take your
entire face at one time I mean it
definitely applied my foundation very
evenly very smooth and natural looking
coverage that's for sure
but we don't like natural I want more I
honestly don't know if I love this brush
I definitely feel I can be my foundation
look matte which is kind of strange that
a brush can do that it definitely gets
the job done very very quick though but
it was a little a little uncomfortable
to hold in my hand
so that's my first impression of that I
do like it the regular artiste brushes
the ones that like toothbrushes better
than that one now for concealer I'm
going to be using the new tart shape
tape concealer and I'm going to be
mixing two shades I'm gonna be mixing
light and medium medium is just a little
romance too dark and light is just a
little bit too light this concealer is
very full coverage I have used it twice
this is my third time using it right now
I'm gonna also put a load down here just
for additional coverage in these areas I
always need it because these are the
areas that my foundation just likes to
disappear for absolutely no reason
throughout the day I don't like Oh
where'd you go I'm just grabbing a damp
Beauty sponge and pressing all of this
into the skin alright so now that I have
pounced all of that in you can see how
much more coverage it has given my
overall face because these are so full
coverage and very creamy but again they
don't really crease at all on me which
is awesome so this is my third time
using that concealer and it's already at
the top of my list which is like crazy
because I'm really hard to impress I
feel like I'm the pickiest on concealer
more than anything else in cosmetics
alright I'm going to pick up cream
bronzer this is the sole a tan Deschanel
my favorite cream bronzer of all time
and I'm going to take a Beauty Blender
and apply it with that and just
literally go right in there like this
and just pick it up and then begin to
pounce it on my skin kind of on the
whole outer part of my face just for an
overall bronzed look but I'm going to
avoid this area down here because that
will widen my face and not give me any
dimension and as you can see I am
pouncing the bronzer I'm not rubbing if
I were to go like this it would
basically just remove the foundation
remove the product and concealer so you
want to go up and down and pouncing
motions and the more you do this the
more it will kind of draw
into place and not move okay so now I'm
going to grab some translucent powder my
favorite one of all time is the RCM a no
color translucent powder because it is
not as drying as the others
I'm going to go back in with a blender
just so you know I have two of them so I
used a one for my bronzer and one for my
concealer and the one that I use for my
concealer I'm not going to dip that into
this powder and set my under eyes it is
still very damp it is the best trick in
the book I know I've talked about it so
many times but literally I will take my
very damp sponge and dip it directly in
there and then just start pressing it on
the under eye the first time I did this
I just felt so backward because we've
always been taught that like creams and
powders don't mix wetness and powder
doesn't mix so going with a damp Beauty
sponge to set my under eye with a powder
I was like oh like I just didn't trust
it I was so nervous but honestly it
gives the most just airbrushed flat
finish to the under eye when I say flat
I mean like not creepy and not like
drying and texture it just makes it look
flat and airbrush okay so now that I
have set my under eye on my t-zone I'm
now going to set kind of just like the
rest of my face but nothing moves as you
can tell us some of my favorite powders
it's almost gone this is the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk powder foundation
I'm not doing this for any additional
coverage I'm just doing this so that
everything stays in place and I don't
know why I don't like setting my entire
face with translucent powder I just like
setting those specific areas and in the
rest of it I just lightly dust it with
this powder and I will go over the
bronzer just a little bit not much but
just a little so kind of blend it in
with the rest of the face alright so now
we're going to move on to the eyes and
I'm going to be using the anastacio
modern renaissance palette I have not
even used this yet I'm not kidding I was
so excited about this I was posting
about on Twitter I was talking about on
snapchat haven't even used it yet you
guys that's what my life has come to
it's literally dirty
it looks like I've used it because I've
touched it so many times I'm just
watching times but I've never actually
used it on my eyes Oh sick and wrong
stick it wrong I'm going to first go in
with this burnt orange
right here and a natural hair fluffy
brush this is the morphe m4 for one and
two go ahead pick that up I'm going to
just put this in my crease because I
want to have like a really yes honey I
want to have a really warm I want my
eyes basically to look like a sunset I
want to have like a warm orange reddish
creamsicle looking crease with purple
smokey shadow going like up into the
warmth yes I have a vision I feel like I
don't do makeup as well when I do talk
throughs like I feel like I do a better
job when I just do them and I do
voiceovers because when I'm doing talk
throws I might focus on where I'm
staying I'm not as focused on what I'm
doing all right now I'm going to pick up
some raw Sienna that shade right next
that next to it very similar but just a
little bit more like a baby pukey
undertone which I am all about that life
now put that right over top I'm just
using this shade to kind of blend out
that burnt orange so that we have what
no harsh lines I'm going to go in with
real dar real gir realgar I can't
pronounce anything I'm going to take a
little bit of a smaller brush for a
little bit more precision and put that
again right over the same colors in the
crease bring it all the way into that
inner corner now I'm going to pick up a
small angled brush I showed you guys
this tip in my last video this is the
morphe 47 I'm going to take some
translucent powder right out of the cap
the same when I use on my under eye and
I'm going to just put this right here to
help clean up this shape that I want so
I don't have any eye shadow falling down
and making this messy and sloppy and
then in the end I'll have a too much
shadow all around my eye area and now
that I have that there I'm just going to
take the brush with a little bit of that
raw Sienna leftover on it just kind of
feather it out
you can literally like go over the
transit center and then just reapply it
and it'll work just the same okay now
I'm going to find a dark purple
not really a shade in the modern
Renaissance palette that I'm looking for
when you find a dark dark map her also
let me look for my palettes
alright this color is perfect I'm going
to go in with the natasha de Nonna
palette and I'm going to grab this dark
dark matte purple right here this is
exactly what I was looking for I'm
actually going to take this transit
powder and set my entire under eye and
just bake that right there very
intensely because I'm going to go in
with this dark matte shade and I don't
trust it probably gonna have major
fallout so I just want to make sure my
under eye is covered in case it does
have fallout I'm just grabbing a pencil
brush and just getting my brush real
nice and soaked but then making shirt
off the excess so that we don't have
tons of unnecessary fallout I'm going to
Pat this on gosh it's so hard to find a
pigmented purple it just applies evenly
purple and red shadows are the hardest
shadows to develop and I swear it is so
hard to find pigmented purple and like
this one is definitely one of the best
but even still it's not as pigmented as
the other shades in the palette once I
have that like kind of a thick line
right there it's going to take the brush
and just kind of like go over all of it
and just flicking motions to just blend
it out into those warm colors kind of
like an ombre effect because we don't
want any harsh distinction between the
purple and the warms we just want it to
fade up very gradually
I'm going to grab the violet Voss times
a lauralee palette is this not boss I'm
going to grab this ragamuffin shade
right here on a fluffy brush and just go
over this upper lid area because I just
want to keep that on the orgy side I
don't want my overall vibe to be purple
I want it to be like purple faded into
orange so I'll go ahead and run over
that a couple times do you see all that
purple fallout under there if we do not
bake my entire under eye would be
covered in purple eye shadow thank God
and then you can literally just wipe it
away
it's like magic all right I'm going to
fill in my brows really quick using the
anastacio brow definer and I will be
right back
alright rouser Donna they're definitely
little bit fuller than I wanted them to
be but it happens moving on I'm going to
highlight my brow bone I'm going to be
using the Oprah cosmetics highlighter in
the shade Beverly Hills it's super cool
it's like a wheel of highlight and you
can use like shades individually or you
can mix it all together and use it as
one when I highlight my cheeks I mix all
them together and highlight like I
showed on snapchat
but for my brow bone I'm gonna be using
one chip when you just went right here I
have hit pan as you can see because I
love it so much they are very pigmented
and very easy to apply so I'm just going
to hit me like look at a pigment it's no
joke I'm going to just hit my brow bone
with this nice and soft I don't want it
to be too heavy or like in-your-face but
just a nice soft highlighting the brow
bone
and it's the modern renaissance palette
again and I'm going to grab meaning do
eenie meenie miney moe catch a tiger by
its toe
now I'm going to grab the burnt orange
red shade realgar I think it's called is
really stuck with cosmetic names I swear
I'm going to just put that right over
top of it I'm going to grab that dark
purple shape and then etosha - no -
palate on a flat definer brush and just
put that really really tight to my lower
lashes on the outer corner especially
alright I'm going to pick up a white
eyeliner this is like literally would
not cream but white and this is
fascinating eye Kohl by Mac I'm going to
line my lower waterline with this I'm
going to grab the violet Voss Laura Lee
palette and I'm going to pick up the
shade hissy-fit right here which is just
a nice pretty gold on a small definer
brush I'm actually put that my lower
lash line towards the inner corner
because I just want like a little pop of
gold under here but I'm going to go back
with the Beverly Hills highlighter from
Oh frog I'm gonna pick up that exact
same shade that I using my brow bone I'm
going to just pop it right there on the
inner corner of the eye for that inner
corner highlight pigment alright so I'm
going to throw on some false lashes the
first I'm going to coat my lashes with
some mascara just a real quick alright
for this look I'm going to go in with
some Celaya lashes by flutter because I
feel like it's only appropriate teller
these are some of my favorite lashes
ever they are very dramatic so if you
love the drama then I would highly
recommend sailor lashes they are
beautiful and more than anything they're
most comfortable lashes I've ever worn
like I can wear these all day long like
12 plus hours and forget they're on I
don't feel like I get eager to rip them
off like I do with other lashes they're
just so comfortable okay while I'm
waiting for my lash glue to dry and get
tacky I'm going to bronze my face I'm
going to use Mac give me Sun even though
I already use the Chanel cream bronzer
I'm going to go over everything lightly
with this just for some additional
bronze enos because I definitely want to
have a overall glow
bronzy glow so I'm just going to go over
top of that this is not necessary though
the cream bronzer on its own is
definitely more than enough but you know
me got to be extra alright let's get
these Layla's on yes honey
alright so now I'm going to coat my
lower lashes with some mascara real
quick all right done with that I'm going
to grab some translucent powder and just
dust it under here to clean up this area
a little bit so that it doesn't look I
don't know sloppy I feel like sometimes
it just looks kind of messy down here
and I don't like that I'm going to grab
the benefit cheekathon palette so beast
mode and I'm going to be using coralista
right here alright so now for highlight
I'm going to grab some Prosecco pops I
definitely want like that golden
highlight as opposed to get more white
or silver or champagne I'm grabbing the
Becca cosmetics split panty cheering
Prosecco pop and amaretto hey-oh all
that texture right there not cute the
tip of my nose hello highlight I'm going
to be taking a NARS lip liner in the
shade Playa Dorado and I'm going to line
my entire lips with this it's like a
really intense orange shade
all right so just to make that smooth
since it is lipliner and it can kind of
chunk up easily I'm going to grab a
charlotte tilbury lipstick in the shade
hot Emily I believe it's called my
vision is not the best recently so I
can't really see everything perfectly
but I'm gonna just run over that whoa
all right you guys that is it for this
tutorial I hope that you enjoy I
apologize for my hair but honestly it's
at that point where I'm getting it done
in two days and it needs to cut so bad
that it doesn't matter what I do it just
looks like a dead animals hanging on my
head so I'm not even trying right now
like I'm over it until Tuesday okay
