be doing something totally different
I've never done anything like this
before this is definitely out of my
comfort zone um so this is going to be
like a story time video if you will
about my past a relationship the way
this video came about if you're
wondering like what is happening uh in
my Valentines Day makeup tutorial I
mentioned in the intro that my
ex-boyfriend of three years and never
bought me candy for Valentine's Day
because we were just always conveniently
on a break and then I said the things I
wish that I could say to my 16 year old
self and I was not expecting the insane
amount of requests that I got after
making that statement in that video from
you guys asking me to do a story time
video basically all about my old
relationship my ex my past what you call
it I even know my ex-boyfriend
um from before I met John and fell in
love with him and got married to him as
I mentioned snapchat a couple weeks ago
that was me filming this video and my
ex-boyfriends ex-girlfriend actually
reached out to me keep in mind like we
both dated the same guy and we actually
became friends through it because he was
just like such a jerk I felt like we
were like hey why didn't we put up with
this for so long let's be friends so she
was actually at my wedding when I
married John uh my relationship was in
no way traumatizing but when I look back
at it I'm just like what the hell was I
thinking and why did I stick around for
so long like what was my problem like
I'm a strong girl why did I put up with
that like it was terrible but it doesn't
matter how strong or weak you are you
can get caught up in a bad dysfunctional
relationship whether it's a husband a
boyfriend a girlfriend just a friend
friend a parent like it's easy to get
caught up in two dysfunctional
relationships when you don't really like
take a step back and say like whoa I
need to distance myself um so yeah
that's what today's video is going to be
all about I'm going to walk you guys
through my old relationship and
basically the dysfunction that came
along with it and in kind of say what I
wish that I would have done in the past
like what I could say to my
sixteen-year-old self that was in this
relationship and
tell you guys how I met John and fell in
love with him go grab yourself a glass
of wine pop some popcorn put some Milk
Duds in there yeah uh-huh
and let's get started you guys noticed
my forehead looks really weird right now
when I lift up my eyebrows you can see
it's like chunky I got Botox for the
first time three days ago I've been
wanting to do it for a long time not
like I've tweeted and I've snapped about
it like asking guys you guys questions
uh and I went and I asked her to do like
that tiny is it not possible because I
can't stand my forehead wrinkles uh
today is the fourth day and it's kicking
in and my forehead looks chunky and it's
freaking me out so I've been facetiming
all my friends who have Botox and I'm
like is this normal and some of my
friends are like oh it's totally normal
give it a couple more days and so my
other friends are like oh my god you're
gonna die I'm like so my forehead looks
kind of weird just thought I'd give you
guys a heads up if you like Botox is one
of those things that like so many people
get it done but no one actually like
talks about it it's like this big secret
that we don't want wrinkles and like I
don't get it if it goes completely
frozen in a couple of days I will be
pissed and I will never get it again
because I need to be able make facial
expressions or I feel like I'm just not
myself why am I talking about Botox
let's get into my dysfunctional
relationship let's just do this um I met
my ex-boyfriend when I was 14 years old
I was so freaking young like what no if
I had a daughter I make no bet you're
not dating you're 14 go color go find a
coloring book it was February of 2005 oh
my god how did I remember that um and my
friends were all having this bonfire in
my friend's backyard and so I went over
to the bonfire this Friday night there's
like a bunch of people it was like 10 12
people sitting around the bonfire
talking hanging out and he was seen
there next to me and he was like
definitely flirting with me it took me a
minute to realize but like he was just
going out of his way to do things for me
going out of his way to talk to me when
everyone else would be talking you kind
of lean over and be like so what was her
name again
oh this is your home school Oh
interesting he was just taking the time
to get to know me and ask me personal
questions and as women we freakin love
that like when a guy starts giving you
attention asking your questions you're
like oh my god he's talking to me like
your heart starts fluttering especially
with eye contact and like throughout the
night he kept making jokes and like when
you would make jokes you like look at me
and smile and I was like oh my god and
at the
the night she like winked at me and I
was like oh my god and it's like so
weird because like I'm just being honest
he really wasn't like attractive to me
at all like I'm not saying he's
unattractive like he could be attracted
to other people beauty is in the eye of
the beholder but he wasn't attractive to
me but like his personality was because
he was just so like sweet so when I went
home that night I didn't really think
anything of it I kind of just had the
butterfly feeling but whatever would
just like didn't think anything of it
then the next weekend came around and he
was around again hanging out the same
group of friends and all of a sudden
he's like popped up and I had never seen
him before but all of a sudden he
started hanging around all the time and
he same exact thing which is showing so
much interest in me all the time
so then finally after seeing him like
two or three times and just like talking
to him but that's all that ever happened
I text his best friend that was one of
my friends and I asked him I was like so
what's the deal with so it's so I can't
mention his name because that's just
like not cool um but I asked him like so
what's the deal was so-and-so you know
like what's going on they're like you
know I'm definitely getting vibes and
like I'm feeling some type of way
whatever and he came back to me and he's
like oh that's not even a thought he has
a girlfriend excuse me
okay that should have been my first clue
right there chocolate you're done
walk away that's something that I wish I
could tell myself like honey if you if a
guy is flirting with you and paying
extra attention to you and you find out
he has a girlfriend you're done for
multiple reasons because you don't want
to be that girl who ruins a relationship
that's a whole that's awful feeling
inside and not to mention if he's doing
that to her he's gonna do the same damn
thing to you like if he why are you
gonna start relationship with a man who
is like obviously willing to cheat on
his girlfriend because he's gonna do the
same thing to you when he gets bored a
year from now that was my first clue and
I did not see that clue so I was just
like oh my god he has a girlfriend like
my heart was like so broken like oh my
god what we've been flirting for three
weeks like get over a Jacqueline well
then like an hour later he texts me so
let's just call him mark okay because I
can't use his real name and you guys are
going to get confused but let's just
call my ex-boyfriend mark so mark text
me I can't
market that night in there so weird he
texts me and is like hey my friend told
me that you were texting him asking
questions about me with like a winky
face and I'm like no like no no you're
not going to start texting me at this
point we had been not been texting yet
we had only been seeing each other like
with mutual friends but I hadn't gone to
the point where we were talking the
phone and texting and stuff he's like
here's my a I am name because those are
the days of thing I am we're like you
had your buddy list and you got online
and you talk to you like that as a post
like texting and like social media now
and so he's like here's my a I am name
like why don't you hop on and like we'll
we'll talk about everything there so I'm
like okay so I got on I I started
talking to my a.m. and I start telling
him like you know this just I heard you
have a girlfriend like you know I feel
kind of weird and told me how his
relationship has been going on for two
years but it's coming to a brief halt
like it's done and she knows it's done
and it's over and like how you know he's
basically just cleaning up the mess
right now but they're broken up and I of
course like an idiot believed him
because he was just so sweet and like
genuine and kinda seen so he long story
short for the next year yes year played
with my emotions because he would not
actually commit to me in a relationship
again I would look back at myself and be
like Jacqueline if a guy is not going to
be willing to commit to you then that's
not the guy for you
like that's what I wish I could say to
myself it's just so frustrating so we
literally played this game of like cat
and mouse I want to say because
basically him and i's entire
relationship was just lies it was based
on lies and it just got bigger lies and
it was just the most controlling
manipulative thing i've ever witnessed
in my life all my 16th birthday was the
day that he finally asked me to be his
girlfriend and he shoved my house with
two dozen roses and balloons and freakin
teddy bears and a full-on performance
and was like will you officially be my
girlfriend and of course I'm like crying
about
it was that reward of like he's
committing to me like he loves me it was
that reward of after a year and it's
sick but that's basically how a
relationship was when I look back at it
I'm like it's sad I was like a dog like
doing tricks for treats like that's
basically what our relationship was and
it sucks because I have always been a
very very strong-willed bold person I
have no problem speaking my mind I have
no issues confrontation like that just
always been my personality but even
still I got sucked into this and if I
can get six ups up into this then anyone
can get sucked into this because I look
back and I'm like how how did this
happen to me but it just did it started
so sweet and kind and charming and there
was always I contact and he was
genuinely asking questions about me and
he would smile and he would make jokes
and then once I was in and once I loved
him and once I was like okay like I'm
giving you my all I'm giving you my
everything and I wasn't wrapped up in
him he just started pulling back when he
officially became my boyfriend I
officially became his girlfriend that's
when things got bad so I end up finding
out that him and his girlfriend didn't
actually break up until he and I have
been together for like six months of
course I had absolutely no idea I am
finding that out so when we became
official all of a sudden all these got
you things started happening I went out
of town to Chicago to visit my sister
which I did all the time and because at
that time my parents were kind of on the
rocks and so my I went to go see my
sister a lot so to kind of get away from
that at home dysfunction which also
leads back to why I think that I had so
much dysfunction and my relationship is
because I was seeing dysfunction
starting to happen to my parents
relationship but that's a whole nother
level but I would go to see my sister
for like a week or two at times in
Chicago just kind of get away from home
and like I would go up there in Chicago
and then I would find out through like
the game of telephone
people would end up telling me how like
oh yeah he took so-and-so up for ice
cream and it was a girl I'm like wait
why is my boyfriend taking a girl for
ice cream and then I call him upset and
I'd be like why did you take you know
Kara out for ice cream like that's not
that's not okay to just take this
beautiful girl out for ice cream and not
tell me and then he's just he would come
down on me and beat me up verbally about
it I mean like he wouldn't calm he
wouldn't be like you piece of he
wouldn't say stuff like that to me but
he would just like mind play the hell
out of me like manipulate me in ways I
didn't know I was being manipulated and
he who brings stuff up from the past of
things that I've done the things that I
never meant to be like manipulation or
hurtful in any way and try to twist
those against me to use them to make me
feel like a lesser person and he was so
controlling to the sense even down to
the fact like he wouldn't let me wear
white shorts because he said that my
butt was too round and when I was in
white shorts that it was gonna make
other guys look at me and it's not like
I was wearing like hoochie mama shorts
just white shorts he just wouldn't let
me wear white denim Hollister shorts
because he was like guys we're gonna
look at you so like I would get dressed
and then he okay well you can only wear
that around me we're gonna go hang out
people so you need to change your
clothes right now and you would make me
go change my clothes into different
shorts or put on a pair of jeans I
couldn't look a certain way in front of
other people like almost like I was his
property that well that's only for me
and it's like no bitch you don't owe me
like I'm Jacqueline like I'm not I'm not
labeled as your girlfriend I'm labeled
as Jacqueline my own person me and like
you need to either accept that you need
to accept me in white shorts or capri
pants or jeans or get the hell out of my
life she did so many things behind my
back like when I was younger all my
friends started drinking and smoking
weed and I was not interested in that
those things scared me I dealt with
anxiety and I didn't want to try those
things but I was so curious about them
like well what does it feel like when
you're drinking what does it feel like
when you get high like I would ask
questions and he would come down on me
so hard like he was my dad he would come
down on me and reprimand me of how like
oh if you ever had ones with alcohol
Jacqueline we would be done like that we
would break up like that I'd be done
with you like just and I'm not trying to
say that he should have been like yeah
girl go out and get wasted you're only
17 years old no but like it was just
always like he could never even let me
ask questions he could never even let me
like explore myself my mind my thoughts
without him coming down on me I would
have
and who just crush it and I have thought
and you crush it and it was just painful
it was awful and then I ended up finding
out that behind my back he was drinking
he was taking pills he was smoking weed
I had no idea I had no clue then one
time again when I was in Chicago staying
with my sister um his ex-girlfriend the
one that he dated for two years before
me she messaged me on Facebook and just
spilled the beans it was one of those
things where he had promised me that him
and his ex-girlfriend were dun-dun-dun
like he has not seen her he is not
spoken to her he deleted her number
she's moved on she has a new boyfriend
like he had made me all these promises
like you're the only girl for me I'm so
in love with you I'm gonna marry you
we're gonna have kids we're gonna have a
whole like he was like so committed to
me and made me feel like so safe you
know but then ii would do something to
upset him like wear white shorts to piss
him off all of a sudden it would be like
well i don't really know if we have a
future together basically his
ex-girlfriend messaged me on Facebook I
see her name and I'm like what the what
the hell cuz like I've never spoken to
her and like oh my god she sent me a
message oh my god oh my god and so I
opened up her message and she just like
goes into details of how she has taken
like taking him lunch to school several
times and she's hung out with him
several times and how I actually went to
his house last month and we sat outside
on the porch and we talked and we
listened to music
and we cried and then I went inside his
mom made us dinner and I'm just like
excuse me and like when I look back at
it now I'm like yeah Jacqueline of
course that happened he's an asshole you
know see that coming
wake up but like at the time I didn't
see it I was so blinded by love I was so
blinded by just him I never saw that
coming and it broke me her message was
sweet too that the thing she didn't come
at me in a rune asti way she basically
told me like what he did to me was so
wrong like he left me for you telling me
that he wasn't really with you but then
I found out that he was with you while
he was breaking up with me and she's
like and I just feel like we're both
victims of the situation she's a guy
so many things that he's done behind my
back in the past and she said I just
want you to know the truth like you know
I'm doing growing I'm doing some growing
up and I'm realizing like how awful he
really is and I just want you to know
the truth so that you can just be aware
of who you're dating she was very very
cool about it but the truth fricking
heart sometimes people like and I'll
never forget like I was just like I
start on my sister was like what's wrong
what's wrong is like my face was just
like white as a ghost just like the
sadness I'll never forget like me and
John talked about it and I'm like I
don't know if I'll ever feel that kind
of like emotional pain again
because like when you're in a
relationship that's that dysfunctional
and it's a relationship where you need
to get out of it for some reason you
have such a sick attachment that when
you find those types of things out it's
like when you find the truth it's
because I deep down inside somewhere in
your brain you know that those things
are happening you know that he's capable
of that but you don't actually
want to allow yourself to truly like
think it and your front brain it's like
in a subconscious and when you get
confirmation that those things are true
it's like your whole world just explodes
it's it's the worst feeling in the world
like my heart just sank and I collapsed
like I'm not kidding my tunnel vision
was so intense I don't know if I
actually passed out or if I just said
got so woozy that I collapsed but my
sister was a jackal oh my god what is
going on she picked me up and I was like
yeah like I was hyperventilating I was
like shaking running around the house
trying to got my phone I grabbed my
phone I called my boyfriend and I'm just
screaming and crying and he said what's
going on what's going on are you okay
are you okay calm down calm down are you
okay being all sweet and concern and
then I'm like yo and I start screaming
at him and then he just like oh he's not
going to have that because no woman will
ever stand up to him no no no he needed
to be the boss and the second thing he
knew I was upset with him oh
changed real quick I told him all about
her message and exactly what it said and
he had nothing to deny he had nothing to
deny but somehow he was so manipulating
me still manipulating me no I don't
remember exactly what his verbage was
but I just remember the emotions I
remember being on the phone sitting out
on their dry
of course just sitting there barefoot
and I remember just feeling like why am
I feeling like crap right now what did I
do wrong like all of a sudden I was
starting to wake up I was starting to
all of a sudden be like wait a second
how is he doing this how are you how are
you playing these games so I broke up
with him I was like I'm done with you
I broke up with him and I was done I was
never going back seriously that's at
least what I thought until I got back
home and he showed up with chocolates
and roses and told me how he loves me
and he can't live without me and I'm the
most amazing than ever happened to him
and then he would show up at my work and
he would bring me coffee and he'd bring
me doughnuts
and it was everyone around me was like
oh he's so sweet I was like okay I guess
we'll get back together he loves me why
Jacqueline why are you getting back
together with him again he doesn't love
you that's not love like that's just not
love it's ridiculous like I was his
property and he wanted to get me back
that's all it was I was his property
when he was being rude to me when he was
being mean to me when he was
manipulating me when he was putting me
down he was giving a silent treatment
when he wasn't answering my phone calls
when he wasn't calling me back when he
was ignoring me I would feel like okay
well I need to make this right like I
felt like the only thing the only task
in my life was to make him happy again
and to get him to reward me like a dog a
dog doing tricks for treats that was our
relationship that's not okay that's
that's sick that's not how it should be
like I'm not kidding three and a half
years of my life was dedicated to
someone else's happiness and I
completely let go of mine I didn't care
about my happiness I cared about his
this person that mistreated me who
mentally abused me I yeah that's what I
care about I didn't care about me and it
was so sick and twisted he broke up with
me all the time for like a couple of
days and times a couple of weeks and
then something terrible would happen
like I remember like a friend of a
friend died and we were broken up and
this is when we have been together for
two half years and I called him bawling
and I'm like oh my god so-and-so died
I'm freaking out and he literally was
like Jacqueline we're broken up you need
to go to somebody else for this and I
was like
okay are you kidding me like you're
pretty significant person in my life
we've been together for two and a half
years pretty much every day and now one
of our friends friend dies and you're
just literally gonna dick you need to go
to somebody else John I don't have it
figured out like 100% absolutely not
John I have real problems just like
everybody else
I'm always looking at my Instagram and
I'll think like how it looks to another
person's perspective and I'm like it
looks like we've got all our
figured out it looks like we're just
like so perfect all the time
that's not true those are photos like
that's not how it is like John and I
have our problems John I have had really
bad problems John I have been on the
edge of divorce you have worked and we
have fought for it and I will say the
past couple of years that have been
amazing they keep getting better and
better our relationship he's getting
stronger we as individuals keep getting
stronger this is the happiest we've ever
been
but it's we've been married for almost
seven years and it's taken a lot of
fight um and that's normal that's normal
to have issues that's normal to fight
with each other when you can't pay the
electric bill you know like it's it's
normal to get upset with each other but
what I went through for three-and-a-half
years
that's not normal that's not love that's
not okay and no one should accept that
it doesn't matter if you are a woman
with a man woman with a woman man with a
man I don't care if you're receiving
this from a woman in you're a man I
don't care how it goes that's not
acceptable being treated and being
feeling like you have to work your ass
off to make this person happy like they
should just be happy with you not every
second of every day but they should just
be happy with you as a person being next
to them that's how it should be I'm
gonna tell you how him and I officially
broke up to kind of wrap the story
together I got accepted into a college
in Sarasota and so did one of my really
good friends which was a blessing and we
moved there together into a dorm room
and my mom told me as I was leaving for
college she was like you know Jacqueline
it's not going to take long and you're
going to be breaking up with him and I
was like what stuff no I'm never gonna
break up with him like I'm gonna get
married to him I mom was like okay well
going off to college is going to change
things and you're gonna get to meet
other people and you're gonna see how
many awesome people are out there and I
don't think you're gonna be together
much longer and I was like you're so
mean like
I thought she was so mean for saying
that I'm like how could you well my mom
couldn't stand my boyfriend no one in my
family could none of them liked him and
they made it very clear to me hold on so
I went off to college and he came down a
couple of times and would see me like
for the day because it was only like 45
minutes away from where I lived at the
time he would come down and see me and
whatever and of course I feel like crap
about myself while I was there and he
digs already meeting guys I'm hanging
out with guys this is a coed dorm room
are you having guys in your room and I
think no I don't care what drove me
crazy is that I was fully committed to
him but because he never believed me and
he was always like oh I'm sure you're
flirting with guys I'm sure you're
hanging out with guys behind my back
that is the thing that made me want to
do that that was the thing that was like
well why don't I start flirting with
guys well why don't I start making guy
friends like if you're gonna sit here
and punish me for do it like for not
even doing anything wrong then why don't
I go do it you're on I'm saying like it
just made me feel that way inside
because it's like I tried so hard to be
good to him and a good girlfriend but
then he would still come down on me for
things I'd even do even though he was
doing all these things behind my back
so basically what happened is one day my
roommate and I we were studying our
asses off because we had this huge 3d 3d
project due the next morning and you
know those days where you're studying
for hours and hours and hours and your
brain just arts to Mel and you just get
to that point where you're like oh and
you get slap-happy and like everything
just becomes a joke to you and you're
exhausted that's what happened so it was
like 9 o'clock at night we have been
eating this jumbo bag of gummy bears all
day and we just had to be the funniest
thing to make a gummy bear music video
don't ask so we opened up our laptops
and we got from school and we turned on
like this really intense hardcore music
and we were like making the gummy bears
rock out it wasn't even funny but we
thought it was hilarious so I took the
video I sent it to my boyfriend I was
like look at how hilarious this is and
he was like that's what you're doing I
thought you were studying and I was like
well I've been studying all day but we
just did this it took five minutes we
thought it was funny you don't think
it's funny and he's like wow so you
can't even call your boyfriend but you
have time to make a gummy bear music
video that's really great Jacqueline and
for the first time I was just like I
don't care I don't care the gerb set I
don't care if you're trying to
manipulate me I just I don't care I can
do better than this
this isn't what I deserve this isn't my
life I'm working so hard I should be
able to take a 30-minute break if I want
to and play with gummy bears like I'm
getting straight A's I'm doing what I'm
here to do I don't care I'm like I was
just like I gotta go I just checked out
I don't know what it was that I finally
was just like I'm done he's like
something finally clicked and I was like
he doesn't love you he doesn't support
you this is awful this is fake this is
not real you've wasted three years of
your life way to go Jack
way to go she was the one for the first
time that freaked out for the first time
he was like why are you doing this why
are you doing this Jacqueline like he
never did that he was the one that
broken with me he was the one that put
us on breaks all the time like this was
the first time that he was just like he
couldn't handle it because he knew that
I was serious he knew that I was truly
done he knew that I was truly walking
away he called me every day probably 40
times a day for weeks to the point that
I took my phone and I threw it at a
broke a brick wall smash it into
hundreds of pieces and didn't have a
phones like a month and a half because I
literally would just like leave me alone
I don't care I'm done just didn't have a
phone I knew my dad wouldn't buy me a
new one I could have for one I didn't
care I just wanted to stop seeing his
damn name show up on my phone and I just
stopped
I checked out I was done and that's
truly how our relationship finally ended
and after we broke up I end up finding
out all these awful things about him all
these things he did behind my back that
none of my friends ever told me about
which I was so angry at them so many my
friends knew all these things they have
been keeping from me about things that
he was doing with other people other
girls and I I had no idea and I was so
mad at my friends like why did you tell
me they're like Jacqueline you were so
wrapped up in it you don't get it like
when it came to him you your brain was
shut off you didn't care so it was just
it was it was it was a wild ride and I I
have to say I do regret the entire
relationship but the same time I dealt
because it taught me so much because
about two months after him and I broke
up John came into my life John called me
one day literally this is how me and
John started dating John called me one
day while I'm still at college I'm like
what the hell is John Hill doing calling
me like
is so weird and I picked the foam and he
just straight up start confessing his
love to me he started telling me how
he's been in love with me ever since I
was 15 years old and he walked into my
house and I was wearing that red shirt
and those jean shorts I thought about
you every day every time I buy something
I think of you every time I post a
picture I hope that you see it every
time I hear a song I hope that one day
we'll listen to it together and I just
sat there like then after my
relationship that had just been in I was
kind of scared to jump in like full deep
but we were married within a year and
John was just the opposite in all the
best ways and he still is like John
actually genuinely cared about me John
will get upset with me when I did
something wrong and when there was a
reason to get upset with me and John I
would fight John I do fight John I fight
hard but we love harder that's what
we've always said that's what my sister
and I save our family to like my family
we fight like I have no problem fighting
with my sister we have no problem
cussing each other out I have no problem
me my brother will yell at each other
and tell each other off but it lasts for
several minutes and then we're done it's
over and we hug and then in 10 minutes
we're making jokes about it and we're
laughing and we move on that's how it is
and John I fight but not like that
there's never like mind manipulation
crazy long fighting it's like scarring
me as a person you know and John was my
breath of fresh air John loved the way I
dress John let me wear heels because my
ex-boyfriend to let me wear heels
because he was like no I'll your it
looks like you're looking for too much
attention when you wear high heels and
that's one of the reasons why I wear
high heels now because I couldn't wear
them for three and a half years because
he wouldn't let me and he made me feel
like I looked so stupid and when I
dressed up on prom and I came out of my
room cuz he asked me to prom and it was
like I felt like oh my god I'm going to
prom and when I came out of my room and
I was wearing like a dress and heels
I felt so insecure I walked out like and
he was like oh wow wow it was just like
I felt so weird because I knew that he
didn't like me when I dressed up he
didn't like me looking like that and
when I started dating John he explained
to me he's like Jaclyn it's because he's
so insecure he's the most insecure guy
in the entire world everyone's always
known it he's like he's so insecure that
he hates that you're confident he hates
it he wishes he had that confidence in
himself but he doesn't he
secur he has to bring you down he's to
make you feel like you can't look good
you can't wear what you want to do you
can do your makeup in your hair how you
want because he feels like crap he wants
you to feel like crap and then when I
felt like crap that's when he felt good
it was sick it was sick and it was
dysfunctional but I mean John embraced
all of it John knew that my ex-wife I
want to let me wear heels and so we had
only been dating for like three or four
months John went Nordstrom and bought me
a pair of heels we were walking one day
and I was like oh those are cute he
bought me a pair of heels behind my back
they're a pair of Michael Kors heels I
still have them because I just think
that it's like the sweetest thing
um and so he bought me those heels and
he's like I want you to wear these as
much as you possibly can I'm like oh my
god
so that's how my ex relationship went
down that's how it went from my ex to
John there was not a long period in
between I really had never been single
honestly since when I was 14 years old
and there really had a single moment I
was single for a couple of months and in
those couple of months I was just like a
good girl at school never had like crazy
single days but yeah so I forgot that
I'm even filming at this point honestly
because I just got like so into talking
about all of this so this video is
honestly I don't know how long we've
been tooling for but my battery's dying

an hour so I'm nervous this video is
