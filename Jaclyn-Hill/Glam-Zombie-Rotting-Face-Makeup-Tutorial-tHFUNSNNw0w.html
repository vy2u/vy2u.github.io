I'm home alone that background is
including me out
all righty-roo
let's do this so first and foremost I'm
going to be priming my eyes I personally
and using a concealer because it works
for me but whatever eye primer that you
love and trusts that's what you're going
to want to slap on those peepers and
then we can move on to shadow I'm going
to be using the Weiser zero one neutral
matte palette and I'm going to take this
creamy color right there this is the
second darkest shade in the palette next
to the lightest one and I'm going to
just begin to pack this on the lid
mainly focusing on the inner corner it's
a very natural shade as you can see it's
nothing dramatic whatsoever but that's
the point I wanted to keep this look
really kind of neutral and not
over-the-top when it came to the eyes
I'm gonna mix these two colors in the
outer corner using a morphe m43 3 brush
I'm going to blend this in the crease
area up toward the brow bone I'm going
to continue to go in with some other
colors from the palette mix it in
together kind of docketing this up
because I did want this to be an all
matte eye and I really wanted the liner
and the lashes to be the dramatic part
so I'm going to take these two shades
and mix these together as well whenever
I'm working with a palette I love to mix
colors together because I feel like I
have all these colors at right there
like for my use so I'm like why not mix
shades and see what we can come up with
so I always love to mix colors when I'm
working with pallets so I'm gonna darken
this up in the outer corner of the eye
but I'm still keeping it very neutral
because I really want the mouth to
clearly be the statement of this look so
now I'm going to go in with Maybelline
gel liner in blackest black and I'm
going to create a wing that can cut
people as you walk into the Halloween
party I want this wing to be very
dramatic very intense very straight I
really wanted it to be the main thing on
the eyes that just popped so as far as
the shadow you don't even need to use
shadow if you don't want it's not
necessary I felt like the most important
thing was the wing and the lashes in the
mouth that's what I was going for
speaking of lashes I'm going to be using
my favorite and these are the Lily
lashes in the style Mykonos and I
thought they were perfect because
they're very dramatic they're very
glamorous and I really wanted a glamour
eye with like a messed-up looking mouth
if you know what I'm saying so even
zombies or vampires or whatever we're
going for today even they have to rock
some good lashes right and a sharp wing
that's how I feel about the situation so
once we have on the lashes I am then
going to go in and start working on the
face and I'm going to use my cover
Foundation this is the shade g30 and
it's actually the paler shade that I own
it's still too dark for me right now
because I have absolutely no sunless
tanner on right now I scrubbed all the
off earlier in the day so I am pale so
I'm actually gonna bring this down and
like darken up my neck as well and I am
using the Tarte foundation brush it
doesn't have a name it literally just
says Tarte on it so I'm just calling the
Tarte foundation brush um you'll see in
a second all of a sudden poof the rest
of my body's a lil bit darker my hands
are still but white yeah that's just
what happened cuz it wasn't looking cute
but don't worry I get my spray tomorrow
and I'll be back in business so I'm
going to use concealer underneath the
eye area and then you can see I start to
put it on my Cupid's bow my chin I'm
like wait why am i doing that I'm gonna
cover that up with blood whatever let's
just throw some on the forehead it's
such a habit just to put it on my mouth
area that I was like this is a waste of
very nice concealer so I'm sorry about
that this is the Urban Decay weightless
full coverage concealer and I'm just
going to be buffing it out with a damp
Real Techniques Beauty sponge which is
my absolute favorite way to do my
concealer I have a Foundation and
concealer routine coming up soon so just
look out for that it's very in-depth and
now I am just setting the under eye area
with powder like normal you're gonna
want to do your whole entire face like
you normally do glam makeup but then
instead of applying lipstick you're
gonna just make it look like you just
got done eating someone's heart out so
let's move on now I'm going to be using
a contour color this is from Mac in the
shade shade stir absolutely love it and
I'm using this brush by morphe for the
first time to try contouring with it and
this is the m-52 3 brush and I really
really liked it so I'll continue using
it and let you guys know if it becomes a
fave of mine or not anyways so
contouring as normal on the cheekbones
and then around the forehead just to
warm ourselves up I didn't want to be a
pale nasty like zombie person I wanted
to have color in my skin I wanted to
have a sharp wing I wanted to have my
brows done you're I'm saying I wanted to
be like half glam but half like oh my
god what happened to your face
so now I'm going to be filling in my
brows using the Anastasia brow Wiz in
the shade chocolate I filled them in and
I go with the spoolie and I buff them
out for like a good 30 seconds and that
is how I have been doing my brows
recently for the lower lashes all I'm
going to do is give them a coat of
mascara I did not want to smoke out the
lower lash line because again I really
want to just that wing in the lashes to
be them
main point of this look and now I'm
going to be using the Becca champagne
glow holiday palette and I'm going to be
mixing champagne pop and pearl together
and highlighting the tops of our cheeks
honey
did you not think I was gonna highlight
of course I'm going to highlight it
doesn't matter if I'm a zombie if I got
done sucking someone's blood eating
someone's heart I don't care what's
going on
I will have my highlight popping just so
you know in the grave still popping so
now we're going to go in with liquid
latex we're going to get to the fun part
now okay I am using liquid latex by
graftobian and then I'm using cotton
balls these just so happen to be organic
cotton balls because apparently I got
fancy any sort of cotton will work any
liquid latex will work oh my god it
stinks this is my first time working
with FX makeup and I just want to say
thank you so much to my good friend Alex
faction for helping me with this because
this is not my forte and so I have to
give him a lot of credit for helping me
so after we lay down the liquid latex
we'll just take strings of this cotton
chunks of this cotton lay it on top of
the latex and then we're going to pack
more liquid latex on so we're literally
going to make a sandwich then I'm going
to take any tweezers and start pulling
this will not ruin your tweezers I use
like an old pair in case it ruined them
because I wasn't sure because it's my
first time ever doing this it didn't
ruin my tweezers so you'll be good with
that again we are going to lay down the
cotton and then put more liquid latex on
top so we are essentially making a
cotton sandwich with liquid latex you
want to have wet latex cotton more wet
latex and then we'll go in with tweezers
and begin to kind of pull it apart you
don't need to pull it apart I'm sure but
I wanted to do this to give it as much
texture to make it look as disgusting as
possible like your face has been like
decaying or rotting or I don't know you
know I just I've had this idea in mind
for the past two years know since last
year since last September and I don't
really know if it's a zombie if it's a
vampire I'm kind of confused I just
wanted it to be a disgusting mouth area
with a pretty eye so we are going to
just continue this process the entire
time and a circle around the entire
mouth up by the nose and just kind of
pick at it as you go like you'll get the
feeling it's funny because when I
started I was like this I'm not going to
be go to this I'm not gonna be I'll do
this but I got into it very quickly and
I was like okay I can do this and you'll
start to see like okay I want kind of a
stringier piece over here I want more of
a bald patch here and you'll start to
get the vibe as you go with it like
you're create
juices will start to flow you'll start
to have fun with this so just make sure
that you continuously are really making
sure that you have a ton of that liquid
wet latex on because that is really
going to be the thing that gives you
this intense nasty texture that just
makes your face look horrifying this is
just the funniest thing to me you guys
I'm sitting here telling you guys how to
look so disgusting when I'm normally so
the opposite so at this point we are
cutting things up here on our face I'm
pulling things off with tweezers I just
felt like it looked too smooth and I
wanted to look Messier and past year so
that's what I did now I'm going to go in
with my normal foundation that I just
got done using all over my face and I'm
going to begin just going over this with
a brush but make sure that you wait
until it's completely and totally dry
otherwise you will 100% ruin your brush
so once it's dry it'll take like five
minutes go over it and then I'm going to
go in with the makeup forever flash
palette palette doesn't say powder
makeup ever flash palette and I'm going
to use the bright red and the dark brown
and I'm going to mix those shades
together to get some bloody looking
color you do not have to buy this
palette just for this look because it's
very expensive I would suggest just
using some fake blood of some sort or
just get some cheap face paint or
something like that but I happen to have
this palette from a couple years ago so
that's what I'm going to be using so I'm
mixing those shades together I'm going
to be buffing this all around my entire
mouth area at this point I'm gonna be
going back and forth with a lot of
different things to really make my mouth
the desired look that I'm going for so
now I'm using a shadow blending brush
and I'm using a really really dark cool
tone brown to kind of add kind of like a
purplish bruise look to the mouth area
because I felt like red just wasn't
enough at all no matter how much red I
was putting on I was like I feel like
this is not going to give me the look
that I want so I really wanted to give
it more dimension and so it has more
depth to it and really looks more
realistic and just disgusting and so
that's why I'm adding in like this
really dark kind of purpley grayish
brown shade and I'm going to dust that
all around and as you can see it's
starting to look more bruised it's
starting to look a little bit more like
it's rotting like it's decaying and now
I'm going to go back in with more of
that red and brown face paint mix
together and I'm going to add that on
top normally I would never suggest to go
back and forth with creams and powders
but it look like this it's ideal because
you want it to get nasty looking so it's
perfect now I'm going to be using mehron
liquid blood and I'm using
the really dark blood is called dark
venomous I believe and using a sponge
I'm going to pack this all over the
mouth area I'm going to keep going back
and kind of tap this with a sponge all
around the mouth to make it look a
little bit more realistic and I'm gonna
blend it out a little bit I don't want
it just to be on the mouth I kind of
want it to be all around the face a
little bit so as its drying and spinning
a little tackier I'm kind of going to
stamp it around that whole entire mouth
area but I want it to be the darkest at
the lips that way it looks like I just
got done sucking someone's blood or
eating your man's card out I don't know
I don't know what's happening you guys
I'm just having fun with this so roll
with me I'm blending out that outer area
with a little bit more foundation on
this brush just because I felt like it
looked a little messy and I don't care
if I'm a zombie
I don't care what the situation is my
 needs to be blended and so does
yours so blend it out when in doubt
blend it out things will get better I
promise you so that is the end of this
look you guys I hope that you enjoy
thank you so much for watching I love
you and happy Halloween
