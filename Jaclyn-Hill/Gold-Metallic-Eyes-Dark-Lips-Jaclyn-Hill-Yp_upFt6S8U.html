to be doing a makeup tutorial on this
look right here I am so in love with
this look and so happy because you know
how sometimes you envisioned a look in
your mind and then you sit down and you
actually try to do it and you're like
where does not look the same like I
literally dream about makeup pretty
often and I'll wake up and like before
even doing my makeup I mean before I
wash my face I'll run to my vanity and
start doing my makeup like I dreamt it
and I'm like it's not the same it
doesn't look as pretty well this was the
total opposite like I saw this look in
my mind and then I sat down on camera
and did it today and I was like thank
god it's coming together so I absolutely
love the way this looks about a week ago
I was on snapchat wearing this look
combo right here I'm getting those like
screenshot images from snapchat several
times a day every day because people are
still asking about what combo was so I
figured I had to do a video with the sub
combination obviously people were liking
on snapchat I just didn't know what I
love to pair with it to make it worth it
for a tutorial you know
so last week I ordered from Sephora
every single one of the new Pat McGrath
eye pigments and I got them in the mail
on Saturday night and I just opened them
yesterday and the second I saw this
color I was like done done I use the
Kylie Burgundy palette in this look as
well I have to say I really like this
palette and the colors in it I don't
like the first one but that's just my
personal preference like that's not
because the color is like bad or
anything I just don't like it on my
skintone I think it's kind of dull on me
but all the other colors I really really
like and they have good color payoff
this eyelashes driving me CooCoo Magoo
but anyways yeah that's it I hope that
you guys enjoy it as a makeup tutorial
if you get inspired by this in any way
shape or form please make sure to tag me
recently I have been getting into bed at
night laying down and going through my
tag images
seeing everything that you're doing it
just inspires me so much I love it when
I see you guys get inspired from one of
my looks but then you like do it with
toy different colors and it doesn't even
look the same but it's still so cool
like I was one inspired you and then
your look is so different that you
inspire me back in return I don't know I
just like the circle of life I just
so anyways I love you guys thank you for
watching and I'll see you soon bye hey
guys just a quick disclaimer please
don't mind my voice and feeling a little
under the weather right now so I know
it's not the normal but I'm going to
start off with today's look by priming
my face and I'm using the girl on face
primer which has quickly become my
favorite one and then I'm going to
drench my face as you're going to see
I'm literally going to give myself a
shower and some mac fix+ just because I
was feeling really dry this day and I
did a mask before this and then I wanted
to just douse myself in fix+ that way my
foundation goes on really dewy and
creamy and it doesn't like stick to any
dry patches I'm going to be using the
cover FX natural finish oil-free
foundation it is a full coverage but it
is also very hydrating it has a natural
finish I think it has more of a dewy
finish personally on me which I love I
am going to be using my Beauty Blender
to apply this which is definitely kind
of different out of the normal for me I
used to love Beauty blenders I've kind
of gotten away from them as far as my
foundation application recently and I
will say I just think that I just don't
think it gives you a full coverage
finish which is what I'm going for and
on me personally I feel like it's a
little patchy
I just prefer a brush for some reason
but on my under-eye I live breathe die
and sneeze for a beauty blender like it
is my absolute number one way to blend
out my under-eye so I am using the Tarte
shape tape concealer which has quickly
become my favorite concealer of all time
if you guys haven't tried it yet I
strongly recommend it it is amazing full
coverage it sets itself you honestly
don't even need to use a powder if you
don't want to it's beautiful then I'm
going to go in with my RC ma no color
translucent powder i spilt it all over
my pads oh it was so sad but I am using
this just to strictly set the under-eye
and I am using a pouncing motion and not
swiping if you swipe it'll totally
defeat the purpose
so just pounce up and down and that's
what will set the concealer all day and
keep it matte then for the face I'm
going to use the Mac mineralize
skinfinish face powder I'm going to set
with a big huge mama powder brush and
then I'm going to go in with the kylie
burgandy face palette I'm going to use
that second color top and center it's a
very nice kind of warm medium tone matte
brown I'm going to pick up a blending
brush this is the morphe m41 one as
always it's always my first brush to go
in with
I'm going to begin to buff this in the
crease going back and forth in
windshield wiper motions I'm keeping it
just as pigmented in the inner corner as
I am in the outer corner once I have
less pigment on that brush and there's
barely any eye shadow left I will take
it and sweep it up towards the tail of
the brow just to really give that nice
and blended and faded out effect and
will also help us create kind of more of
a cat eye look which is the shape that I
typically go for even if I don't want it
to be dramatic I always want a very
subtle cat eye look it just makes your
eyes look very awake when they're kind
of like pulled upward and back towards
the temple I'm going to continue just to
put more of that medium brown shade on
from the Kylie palette until it's like
the color that I'm desiring then I'm
going to pick up the Pat McGrath pigment
in the shade bronze and it comes with
the mehron mixing liquid so I'm going to
dip my brush in that and go ahead and
apply all over the lid it literally
applies like water like when you've
never experienced anything like it goes
on literally like water and what I'm
going to do is I'm using a synthetic
brush this is the Mac 242 I'm going to
put that all over my entire lid and then
once it kind of dries a little bit I'm
taking it up into my crease and kind of
blending in with that matte brown color
now you'll see you later how I really
blended this out and made it work but at
this moment I'm just putting it all over
the lid and then once it dries a little
bit I'm going to take in that crease and
then kind of just go back and forth and
Winchell wiper motions I did pick up a
pencil brush to blend out just with a
totally blank pencil brush with nothing
on it and I was like ah it looks good
but it could look better I went in with
a second layer because as you can see
when you do a second layer it like pops
like crazy like one layer is beautiful
but to me a second layer is even better
so I wanted it to really have that
intense like show stop and pop and
effect then for the brows as always I'm
using the Anastasia brow definer I feel
like nothing will ever take me away from
this we are in a full committed
relationship I'm using the same shade
chocolate and then blending it out with
a spoolie got to go back in with that
exact same color and begin to put it on
my lower lash line and for this I am
using the m50 six this is by morphe I
use this brush a lot in this tutorial
I've been loving it recently and as
you'll see I'll use this brush to create
a really soft cat eye effect and you'll
see how easy is with this brush and I
don't know why I've never discovered
this before but it just makes it so
simple I barely have any products on my
brush and I'm just going to kind of wing
it out
towards the tail of my brow then as
you'll see I'll connect it towards my
upper eye shadow and its give me a
really really soft cat eye effect and I
just love it then this is just a tip if
you ever have your brows too dark and
you feel like it just needs to be
lightened up take some translucent
powder on a brush dust it over top grab
a brush or a spoolie and just kind of
run over it and blend it out and it will
just naturally lighten the color of your
brow if you go a little too ham like I
tend to do sometimes and I'm going to
pick up this color at the very bottom
left side of the palette wait is that
right bottom left huh if you're looking
at its bottom right I can't get it
together guys I am not feeling the best
my brain is not really working today but
with a definer brush I'm going to put
that right on the lash line just to give
it a look a little bit more pop then for
the inner corner highlight I'm going to
use mary-lou manizer by the balm this is
a Mac brush I love it and I don't know
the name of it but it's like the teensy
is little Mac brush of all time I'm
going to use that to pop it on the very
inner corner of my eye and then I'm
going to be using some mascara I don't
know what mascara this is actually it's
from Sephora and I was not a fan at all
it was very watery so anyways I'm gonna
go in with flutter lashes number 207
very flirty very fluffy very long
dramatic but not so over-the-top but
it's like oh damn girl calm down so I'm
going to go ahead and pop these on I am
using the House of lash lash glue I get
asked all the time what glue I use they
don't show at my videos the house of
lashes lash glue I think it's nine
dollars and it is my absolute favorite
of all time I mean they will not budge
with that glue it's like super glue but
don't get scared not actually super glue
I'm going to use Mac give me Sun bronzer
and this huge bronzer brush this is the
e2 bronzer brush by morphe my two
favorite bronzer brushes are this and a
Tom for bronzer brush but obviously
there is insane price difference so if
you're looking to save money I would
definitely try out the e2 by morphe
because it's my favorite next to the Tom
Ford I'm going to blend this all over my
entire face I always start on the
cheekbones and forehead but then I kind
of take the brush where there's really
not much products left on it and I kind
of go over everything on the outer
corner of my face avoiding the center
just to make sure that it's totally
blended and then I'm going to grab a
Beauty Blender with more of that RCM a
translucent powder I'm going to kind of
just lightly sculpt out I don't want
this to be too intense I don't want to
make this look like a straight
tor because it definitely has a more
terracotta warm almost oranjee undertone
so I don't want to do that I just
thought that it looked really messy down
there and was kind of making like the
lower half of my face look a little bit
bigger than it was so I'm going to go
ahead and clean up a little bit to give
myself a little bit of structure now for
blush I'm going to be using the Marc
Jacobs blush in the shade
5:02 it's a really pretty lip corley
pink shade i love the formula these
blushes they're so nice very creamy and
blendable then for my brows of course
I'm using the clear brow gel by
anastasiya I swear it's such a simple
thing but if I don't have clear brow gel
I feel like I can't leave the house it's
like the one of the most important
things to me in my makeup collection I'm
going to pick up the super shimmery kind
of golden bronze e shade in the Kiley
palette it reminds me a lot of amber
lights from Mac which is a pinch darker
and with a that same definer brush that
I use on the lower lash line earlier to
put that chocolaty Brown I'm going to
put an inner corner because I want to
kind of an all-over bronzy gold effect
I'm using Mac eye Kohl and the shade
fascinating to kind of open up the eye
I'm going to apply that on the waterline
then of course I'm going to just put
some mascara on my lower lashes of
course I feel like this just completes
any eye look and then I'm going to grab
some Mac amber lights because I just
felt like this I look really needed this
and the Kylie shade which is a little
too dark for what I needed so I'm going
to grab that same M 506 brush that I was
using earlier I'm going to just blend it
on the inner corner only and it made
such a difference it's exactly what this
look needed and I felt like okay finally
this look is complete it just blended
everything out since it is a similar
color as a Pat McGrath but just a little
bit lighter and a little less metallic
it just really made everything come
together and look really beautifully
blended blended I can't talk today I'm
sorry you guys I'm gonna go in with the
Tarte skin twinkle palette vol 2 my
goodness that sounds like it's a book
I'm going to be highlighting the tops of
my cheekbones my Cupid's bow basically
my whole face you know how I do but
after I applied this basically
everywhere I realized I thought it was a
little bit too of a white silvery
highlight for this look specifically I
was like I feel like it just stands out
too much and I don't want my highlight
to stand out too much do not crucify me
for saying that but I wanted my eyes to
be the star of the show and not
necessarily my cheek highlight so I kind
of rubbed it down my finger
and then went in with the anastacio glow
kit and picked up the shade white sand
and applied that over top I would use
champagne pot but I feel like I use it
all the time mama needs to take a break
people call me out for using champagne
Bop too much na so I'm going to just
apply that right over top and I felt
like it just made much much more sense
to the overall look it wasn't as white
it had more of a golden base and that's
what I really needed for the lips I'm
gonna go in with Kylie cosmetics vixen
liquid lipstick I will say if you're
going to wear this by itself without a
gloss or anything over top you're
definitely going to need the matching a
lip liner I wore it by itself a couple
weeks back and from personal experience
you have to apply the lip liner all over
the lip first if you want it to go on
smooth and not patchy and wear
beautifully since I'm going to go in
with a gloss over top I'm gonna put it
straight on the lips and then I'm going
to be applying Kylie cosmetics jolly lip
gloss no this is not sponsored no Kylie
did not hit your girl up and tell me or
asked me to do this believe it or not
she actually has no idea and I don't
think she even give us a tiny rat's ass
about me doing this right now but I
really love this lip combination I think
it's beautiful just a tip when you're
applying dark lip gloss just don't apply
it too close to the very very very edge
of your mouth otherwise it will start to
bleed throughout the day and get messy
last but not least I'm going to spritz
the face with some mac fix+ so that we
glow all day and you're good to go thank
you so much for watching you guys I hope
you love it and I hope you have a
wonderful holiday bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
