so the first thing I'm doing is putting
the eyeshadow vanilla on my brow bone
and it's a velvet so it's not going to
be too shimmery because we don't want a
lot of shimmery because in this look
we're going to have a lot of shimmer on
the lower lid so we want to take more
like a velvety matte shade up by the
brow I'm taking night divine and then
putting it all over my eyes and I'm
going to push up all the way into the
corner I'm not going to go above my
crease just stay down in there if you
want to go slightly above your crease in
the inner corner you can but I'm not
then I'm taking a clean brush even
though it doesn't look clean and I'm
sweeping it back and forth just so that
we don't have any really harsh jaggedy
outer edge lines and then I'm taking
soft brown on a really fluffy brush soft
Brown is a matte shade by Mac and I'm
fluffing it up and out towards the outer
corner of my eyebrow now I'm taking
saddle on a more dense brush this is the
217 brush by Mac and saddle is like a
really beautiful warm Brown and the
contrast of that cool tone silver and
this warm Brown is what really pulls
this look together and I'm just blending
that right above night divine I'm
bringing the two together a little bit
in the outer corner as I'm making like a
rounded shape I'm making this shape just
to compliment my eyes I wouldn't do the
same on everybody and then with that
clean brush I'm just gonna fan it up
towards the wing of my eyebrow and
towards the high point because you just
kind of want this to have an area effect
and we put the lashes on it'll really
compliment it you don't want it to be
sharp and now I am putting on black
eyeliner a pretty thick line when I'm
doing any type of smoky eye I normally
tend to make my eyeliner a little bit
thicker um but now I'm adding a pair of
red cherry false lashes there the number
43 and I'm just putting those super
tight against my lash line and then I'm
going to take the shade saddle that I
used in that
corner again I'm going to just dust that
underneath my eye on a flat shader brush
I don't want this to be like a tight
line thing I want this to be more
relaxed down there and fluffy and airy
so I use the bigger brush now here's the
best trick take mascara and put it on
your real lashes at the base of your
false ones do not drag it all the way up
and it'll make them look so fluffy and
it'll help tie your real ones and your
false ones together it's the best trick
and now I'm taking gel liner and I'm
tight lining it just right under there
because once again it'll help them look
more natural and thicker see how much
better they're looking already I'm
taking wedge which is another shade by
Mac and I'm just gonna like run it
against that saddle underneath my eye
because that's going to help blend it
out wedge is such an essential when it
comes to blending out that bottom lash
line I use it for every color even if
I'm working with purples and blues i use
wedge to blend it out it's gorgeous and
obviously this is self-explanatory I'm
just doing my mascara again umm now I'm
contouring with just a really light
light powder that I have it's a mineral
powder by Mac and I'm not gonna actually
bronze
I'm just contouring just a little bit
and I'm taking it all around my forehead
dragging it in downward motion please
don't stare at my hair oh my gosh um
bringing it down underneath my
cheekbones you know how it goes I'm just
blending it around then I'm taking
dainty which is a really baby pink shade
by Mac and I'm putting that on the
apples of my cheeks and dragging it up a
little bit um I loved putting pinks with
brown eyeshadow I think it's really
complimentary and then I'm taking a
highlighter which there are highlighters
everywhere in the world
um this specific one is just an
eyeshadow by Mac but I'm tapping that on
the high points of my cheeks and once
again it's not super shimmery because my
eyes are the main focus here I don't
want really shimmery cheeks or face at
this point I want it to be a little bit
more natural now I'm taking a boldly
bare lip liner by Mac and I'm lining my
lips I'd normally do a really nude lip
but I wasn't in the mood today so
I'm lining them and then I'm putting
blankety lipstick on top I'm just going
to dab it in rub my lips together and
then that look is complete and that's
basically it yeah if you want to add a
clear gloss you're more than welcome but
I didn't okay bye see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
