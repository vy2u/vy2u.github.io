want in December and you can't judge me
those are just my rules hey guys welcome
back to my channel for today's video I'm
excited like so excited I know I said
all the time but I am like ridiculously
excited because this video okay I'm
going to be bumping into these
constantly I can already foresee that
happening but I have seriously worked so
hard on this video it is not sponsored I
know that a lot of people are probably
too think because this is a holiday gift
guy that it's gonna be sponsored by a
brand or a blanket or even this
coca-cola right here but it's not
I wish coke hit me up I love you I've
been drinking this recently so I
went out and purchased every single item
that you're gonna see today that way it
was brand new and fresh out of the
packaging and you guys could really see
what it looks like when it comes and
know what you're gonna get if you choose
to purchase any of these things for a
friend or put on your Christmas list I
am so hot you guys I can't put my hair
please like I know I just started this
video literally 20 seconds ago but I am
like dying right now I'm so hot and
sweaty there is a lot of makeup in here
a lot of beauty products but there's
actually like not that much compared to
other stuff that I have like other gifts
so I wanted to incorporate everything
for everybody so there's some stuff in
here like the men in your life would
like there's some stuff in here like
younger girls look like your mom would
like that sort of thing so I
incorporated tons of different stuff so
I'm gonna stop babbling and let's get
into the video a little also type every
single thing out and put in the
description box for you guys down below
to make it easier for you to navigate I
know there's a ton of people out there
that literally have absolutely no idea
what to get like their sister-in-law you
know I started make this videos to give
you guys ideas you want to survey have
to purchase the things that I'm talking
about obviously but maybe it'll kind of
spark something up in your mind a little
bit ooh I kind of like that category you
know that's what I'm here for
let's just kick it off with the most
obvious thing that's gonna be in this
video who doesn't love a good candle
even John loves it when I like these
candles he's always complimenting how
good it smells always complimenting the
way it lights up the room like everyone
just loves a candle lit it's like you
don't know that you need it until you
have it lit and then you're like oh just
change the vibe and it just feels good
my two favorite holiday scents as of
right now what you have to say they've
never really changed they've in my
favorites like the past four years but
this one right here is twisted
peppermint and it's actually called let
it snow but no matter what they like me
the scent like it's twisted peppermint
and then this is my number one holiday
set of all time because it truly smells
just like that quintessential holiday
scent and it's called winter oh my god
every single time I like this I just
feel like yep it's Christmas bitches
when I light this candle I feel like I'm
just like in the cold forests just
surrounded by evergreens like that's
just how this is where this kale takes
me and these candles are $24 a piece but
let's get real no one ever pays full
price for these candles except I did but
I always find it for this video
but these candles are known for going on
sales constantly and especially this
time of year they go on a sale like
every single weekend pretty much where
you can do buy one get one
this right here is by the brand Voluspa
I think is Voluspa value Spa I don't
really know exactly how to pronounce it
but it looks like Voluspa so that's what
I'm gonna call it and it has four
different candles inside right here and
it is so beautiful like these candles
honestly like when you're done with them
I would just like scrape out the rest of
the wax and put like little photos in
there or like little like tea lights or
like the fake ones you can get like
pottery barn's they're like remote
control because these sparkles so much
when you like them so it's for a
different sense they are so strong and
fragrant so they are very pigmented
candle very pigments and cents you can
smoke them across the house this is a
great gift for someone who really really
loves like beautiful candles luxury
things and different sense because it is
a little bit pricier but you are getting
absolute incredible packaging not only
on the outside the box with the actual
candles inside as well this says retail
for 50 dollars which I know is kind of
expensive for 4 candles it's not kind of
it is expensive I'll just say it as it
is but when I pick this out I definitely
had in mind like a Secret Santa gift you
know like how it like people's jobs
they'll do it a 50 dollar Secret Santa I
personally would love to get something
like this from Secret Santa and it's
great because so many different people
would love it and those are really hard
to do like sometimes whenever I'm
involved in a Secret Santa I'm like well
what do I get like what is everyone
gonna like honey
the answer is candles everyone likes
candles I say my favorite holiday candle
for laughs because when I tell you guys
that this is the best holiday candle in
the entire world not only because of the
beautiful like balsam Christmas tree
and just Christmas spirit that it brings
to your house with its scent but it is
the most beautiful candle in the entire
world when it's lit it's like this
crackled mercury glass and when it is
lit it just glows all over your walls
and just I may actually turn off all the
lights right now so you can see how
freakin weird is this is just hold on
your panties okay okay so it's
definitely not coming off on camera at
all like it looks in person but you can
still see a little bit of what I am
talking about but I'm in person it is so
much prettier than what the camera is
showing so comes in the small size a
medium and then a large and I believe
the large has double the size of the
medium because it's like it's big and
the large is the prettiest one just
because it's got so much mercury glass
when you light that one next on the list
we have lush backbones because who
doesn't love to take a relaxing bath
make sure that before you buy this for
someone that they actually own a bathtub
because some people don't want bathtubs
I know some apartments that I lived in
I've never had bathtubs don't make them
feel worse about not having a bathtub
and buy them bath bombs just check in
and make sure all the different bath
bombs have different benefits in it and
if you go to lush and actually talk to
them their reps there are so
knowledgeable on the ingredients and
what these specific bath bombs do and
how they're supposed to make you feel
and how they are made and it's just such
a cool process a cool experience I just
love it like some of these bath bombs
are so moisturizing you get out and
don't even need to apply moisturizer or
body butter because you're just so
moisturize just from the bath bomb which
honestly pays for itself and these bath
bombs do range anywhere between seven
and nine dollars which I will say is
expensive for some that you're going to
use one time and be done but to give as
a Christmas present it is a much more
inexpensive gift to give this is also
great if you have any nieces or any kids
in your life or if you're like a
babysitter or a nanny and you want to
get something like a little girl or a
little boy my nieces and nephews can not
get enough of these I have a huge jar my
bathroom that's filled with them and
that is like their favorite thing to
pick out which bath bomb they're gonna
use when they take a bath at my house
and it's just it's so cute like kids
love it but everyone loves that well
it's not just kids you know and they
also have pre-made gift boxes at lush as
well which is super cool they have so
many different options they have all
different ones all exercise all
different price points and of course
once you start buying the bundles you do
save money overall because you're buying
more and you get it you get it but it's
a cool option if you
want to just get one if you want to get
like an actual Bible they have a ton
there right now for the holidays look at
my hair right now what is actually
happening back here I don't know if I
want this to stay up or if I want it to
fall I'm good I have a mullet I'm just
living my life I don't know what my hair
is doing it's not my problem okay so I
have been living in these pajamas
recently so comfortable and so cute and
they fit perfectly I personally I'm
wearing them right now just so you know
but I figured after this video I will
toss it on my sister and let her have it
cuz she doesn't have these yet and I'm
gonna tie your how incredible they are
but what I love about them is that the
ankle right here is open like it's not
like a cinched ankle I don't like a
cinch to ankle on my pajamas it makes me
feel like I can't breathe it's like
holding in like all like my leg heat I
don't know I like it to be open and airy
and the waistband is not like too tight
it's like a nice stretchy soft waistband
on it and then the actual shirt I'm not
wearing the matching shirt I'm wearing a
different shirt which is from the exact
same Department of Nordstrom but this
shirt is long sleeves it's got like a
little scoop neck it just fits perfectly
it's so comfortable it's not SuperDuper
hot it's not too thin it just like it's
the perfect pajama set honestly you guys
it's by making model I know I said
extremely passionate about a pajama set
right now and I'm getting so like hot
and bothered over like oh my god but
jealous but I'm not kidding when I tell
you that I think I'm just as passionate
about like cozy items as I am about like
fashion and like beautiful like designer
pieces like I love nothing more than
comfy robes comfy socks comfy pajamas
that's like just my safe place at the
end of the day I just wrapped me up and
just like blankets and candles and just
coziness and just leave me be they come
in many different colors and designs but
this is just my favorite because I love
gray and the red is super duper
Christmassy and of course it also comes
with a nice sleep mask as well and this
is $59 so it's definitely be more
expensive than like a pajama set at
Target obviously but honey it is worth
every penny it is so cozy and the way I
put these things in my mind I'm like as
long as I don't gain a lot of weight
this is gonna fit me for years you know
what I'm gonna have this and I'm gonna
wear every single like holiday season
for the next three years so I'm like
wait fine so these next pants right here
I had to mention these because this
is something that everybody will love
who doesn't love a pair of comfy pants
that are just perfection I have had
these pants for two years at this point
and I now have it in every single color
that has been sold in because I am that
obsess it is the perfect pair of just
like thin cozy around the house
drawstring baggy open leg they've got a
stretch to it which I love because like
when I sit down I bend my knees all the
time I don't want a pant that acts like
I just because it like doesn't stretch
these stretch out like Stretch Armstrong
these are usually $48 but they have been
on sale for the past couple of weeks for
$28 which is why I really wanted to
mention them because I think the sale is
gonna last a little bit longer and I got
these from Nordstrom's so if you want
like the best all year long stretchy
comfy pants that honestly make you feel
like you're naked look no further
DKNY they're right here you guys might
think I'm so silly for mentioning socks
in my video but honestly I do not care
socks are one of my favorite things ever
like even when it's the middle of summer
and it's 100 degrees and the humidity is
like 85% here in Florida I still wear
comfy socks around my house at night I
just love to have my feet feel like
wrapped up and cozy when these socks
right here are from Nordstrom and they
are called butter socks do I need to say
anymore that for some reason the gray
ones which I have tons of these gray
ones and I love them but for some reason
the black and the white ones are softer
than the gray one these are eight
dollars they're honestly the softest
socks I've ever experienced in my entire
life they come up the ankle just a
little bit they're not super long or too
annoying and they fit like a dream all
right so this is a high ticket item
alright if it's offensive but I had to
put it in here I have talked about this
for years a lot of you guys already know
what it is I love you guys have bought
it it was sold out for a while I see you
guys send me pictures of you wearing it
all the time it is by the brand barefoot
dreams if you do not know the brand
barefoot dreams girl get on it add
something to your list you cannot go
wrong whether it's their socks their
robes their blankets their pillows their
pants their stuff is so buttery and so
beautiful and so good and worth every
penny and it washes well it wears well
it holds its value it is bum so this
right here is the poncho by barefoot
dreams
it comes in this color and then a gray
color and it looks like this it has a
fringe at the bottom it literally just
slips over your body and it has a good
nice loose turtleneck it doesn't make
you feel claustrophobic it's not like a
tight like trial neck it's very loose
and like open and then it has the little
arm holes right here as well so it's
just a nice little cozy cape it's
basically like a glorified cuter Snuggie
honestly it is so cozy and so
comfortable at the end of the day when
you're like oh I'm so cold me you want
to be comfortable you rip off your bra
you put this on bitch this is everything
I know it's expensive but I had to
mention it because you guys it'll change
your life let's talk about robes real
quick because everybody loves a good
comfy row I keep saying everybody loves
bath bombs
everybody loves candles everybody loves
blankets and I really hope that
everybody does love these things cuz I
feel like everyone in my life loves
these things like even the men in my
life love all these things I'm talking
about but I could be wrong
there might be people out there who
don't like these things and if you're
that person you could just but you guys
know me if you watch my snapchat you see
me in robes it's probably 9 out of 10
times I am snapping even when I have on
like a full face of makeup and I'm like
out living my life and I'll come home
like an hour before I have to like run
back out I literally take off all my
clothes and put on a robe for just 45
minutes before I have to leave to get in
like anytime I'm home I'm in pajamas I
am NOT that girl who walks on my house
in jeans in full jewelry and bras like
what this is actually happen cuz not in
my home like it's like you come in like
give me a bra give me your shoes give me
your panties just kidding Oh bitch and
the fact that it has a hood like I'm
sorry you can't put me in this the
second I put this on I think a bad bitch
like do whatever you want to be my day
down it's not gonna work honestly so
soft it should be illegal like this is
one of the softest things that I truly
own this is $79 it is from Pottery Barn
I love these fat little wrists because I
like to cozy up with my robes and I lay
my head on it so when they have like
extra fabric at the wrists I don't know
I'm here I noticed these things I'm like
yay hello this next robe honest to God
makes me feel like a queen it has got
this faux fur collar and hood on it look
at this hood
that's a Blasi hood come on with the
little matching sleeves I will wake up
in the morning I'll be bossing people
around with no makeup frickin no bra no
panties just this robe just firing you
you're fired you're fired just feeling
like I'm somebody in this robe now that
one was 103 dollars so that one is more
expensive for obvious reasons because
you have all that faux fur on it but
honey next I have these slippers right
here they are super comfy they're a
great fit because they hold on to your
feet like nice and tight like your foot
isn't like flopping around it's lying
off your feet constantly all the time
they are like the Nordstrom brand sold
at Nordstrom so these are $25 which i
think is a great price for a nice pair
of slippers and the bottom are nice and
hard so like you know I try not to ever
wear my slippers outside on my driveway
I do take my dogs out in my backyard and
my slippers and I love these because
they're nice and hard and they're easy
just to wipe off you know they're not
like a cloth bottom which I personally
prefer when my slippers don't have a
cloth bottom if you want a more
expensive option that might hold up a
little bit longer these are my number
one most worn it's the person I actually
have a mug right now like I literally
live in these slippers but like I said
they are more expensive they are by the
brand ugh but can we talk about how
freaking cute these are like they're
grey suede and then on the inside it's
like this silver like metal foiled
material in there it looks so cool these
are 109 dollars so like I said pricier
so if you're just like girl bitch either
the affairs are first I would get these
for $25 because these are very nice but
these are just like oh the mack daddy of
zippers like these keep your feet so
warm and it honestly feel like you are
wearing shoes when you're in the house
like in the most comfy way possible
because the bottom is so six we give you
different options - drew price points
they never know I honestly saved the
best for last because this is the gift I
had in mind for like everybody
especially the men in your life I am
obsessed and everyone who enters my home
is obsessed everyone that I hand this to
immediately gets on their phone or as
one of these from Amazon because I'm
telling you it is absolutely incredible
so I know we have all seen back
massagers we've seen I want you to
extract the back of your chair that once
you use yourself or electronic
they suck right even some massage chairs
they suck this has saved my life so
dramatic right so dramatic they saved my
life but really you guys it's so
incredible I'm gonna put this on a
literally demonstrate it for you I don't
care how dorky I love because village a
girl needs a massage and really
self-explanatory you get the power
button and then it just starts massaging
you and the little massager balls inside
they heat up they just roll around and
massage your back you put your arms in
here like this it's super sexy super
stylin I would honestly go to the
grocery store like this no judgement
I think excuse me um where's your relish
aisle 4 great thank you you just move it
all around your body wherever you want
to put it and just get that massage
going it feels incredible and after I
worked out and my butt was so sore from
the gym I put this on my glutes and I
just pull it so hard and just let it
grind on my ass and it feels so good on
your sore muscles so especially with
like the heat of the balls this is on
Amazon right now for 50 dollars which I
honestly think is an absolute steal for
what it actually is and the fact that
you can just keep recharging it and
using it forever like yes please sign me
up so I personally think this is like
the best Universal gift in the entire
gift guide and I don't think anybody
would be disappointed to receive that
fits amazing I had to take a quick
little break oh my gosh this hair is
definitely trying to something I'm
really not proud of um but you know what
this is the real me and this is life and
I'm gonna keep going with it
okay so first day want to talk about in
the fashion portion of this our scarves
because scars are such a great present
to give to girls scarves to me are my
favorite accessory this time of year
once the weather starts getting cold I
love it you can take some basic outfit
and transform it with a scarf just like
a white v-neck some jeans a pair of
sneakers and a cute scarf and it's just
like it just completes the look they're
just so easy to wear I always treat
plaid and leopard as a neutral like you
can wear it with stripes you can wear
with color you can wear it with neutrals
you can wear with whatever you want it's
so hard every year to find the perfect
leopard scarf that truly is not like too
big of a print to smaller print to gray
to white to neutral to brown this is
just like perfect it's a great size we
can like plump it up and make it look
like really fat and do like an
off-the-shoulder type of moment or you
can like cozy it in put it already to
the jacket so it just comes out the
collar like it
a good leper in a separate scarf is $19
so the price is right this scarf right
here is so cool because this is
definitely thicker Cicilline for warmer
weather for sure this is not as thin as
that one but this is reversible with
like this
checkered print kind of like houndstooth
black and white on one side and then the
other side is red plaid which is so cool
because you can wear it or just the
plaid shows or you can turn around and
wear it like this or my favorite way
would be to wear it so as you can see
both sides so cute so cozy so comfy and
it's like nice and law for me I wear
this with a pair of leather leggings
it's like a black long stick t-shirt
underneath a pair of boots and this and
that would be my entire outfit like it's
just so easy to style scarves and just
make yourself look more put together you
actually are throw your hair up in a
messy bun put on some hoops and rule the
world next I have a pair of just diamond
stud earrings obviously they're not real
diamonds I'm not gonna whip out a pair
of real diamond earrings today only
$5,000
either keeping zirconia pnes in there
are $46 at Nordstrom and they honestly
look so beautiful that if someone was
wearing these I would think that they
were real they have great depth and
great clarity to them and they're just
the perfect little size and I personally
just love jewelry so much obviously I
love jewelry like it doesn't matter if
it's real if it's fake if it's
inexpensive it's no matter what the
price is I love jewelry I just think
that it just glammed up anything as you
can tell I'm definitely kind of girl
where I like a more basic outfit I like
to not have to worry about my hair
cheese clearly you can tell my hair is
literally like mom I just love little
studs and I think it's just like a nice
girly present you know it's a nice
little touch for 50 bucks and get
someone a really beautiful pair of just
Christie blingy looking earrings they
can have their ears all the time nice
think one like a girl has on no makeup
pajamas and has her hair pulled back and
has on like little pretty blingy stuff I
think it adds a little extra pop and it
just looks so pretty so this is the very
very now famous Amy choker by bubble bar
it is so beautiful and so blingy it is
$42 I believe the way it sits here on
your neck it's like this top part is a
choker and then the other two kind of
dangle down alike and that also my Laura
beauty box that I'm doing which is
available for you guys to purchase I'll
pull all that information down below for
you as well a bubble bar gift card does
come in that box so if you do want this
you could use that gift card to apply
towards there was a point there where I
thought like a lot of jewelry it kind of
fell off and I wasn't really having it I
wasn't really like anything and then
this came out and I was just like yes
bitch like they came back in action it's
such a pretty necklace and for $40 like
the price is right cuz this is a
necklace that like honestly I will wear
this for a very very long time to come
do you want to show you guys because
obviously they've never said this but
it's very obvious the bubble bar was
inspired by lawn and jewelry when creepy
not and a lot of jewelry is actually my
favorite jewelry designer in the entire
world I've gotten a chance to spend time
with her and she is just she's such a
cool woman and her stuff is sold it like
Neiman's Nordstrom Saks her pieces are
so ridiculously blingy you guys see me
wear this one all the time I'm gonna be
giving this away it's called the Blake
necklace and her jewelry is just like
exceptionally blingy like when it lays
on your chest it's just like literally
dances on your chest and the reason why
is because her jewelry is actually cut
with diamonds so bougie right so it's
like gold cut with diamonds and it just
makes it so like big pretty obviously
they were inspired
but it's nice though because it gives
people like a much much much cheaper
alternative because this is several
hundred dollars for the original one
right here but still if you're looking
to get someone like a beautiful
beautiful piece of jewelry that is just
like blingy as can be and you're wanting
to spend a lot of money on it for like a
special someone
I would definitely kin to Lana LA and a
because she is absolutely incredible I
actually could not make a video with a
fashion segment without mentioning one
of my favorite faux leather jackets of
all time and this is by the brand blank
and my CL if you can really see it well
on camera I had mentioned this jacket so
many times they have now made this I
think five years in a row they just keep
coming out with it and they might change
like one little thing each time but it's
pretty much the same jacket every year
it's so good it's like so edgy I love it
the zipper is like super dark it's like
a dark dark gunmetal like black zipper
so it's not like just gold or bright
silver because then if I'm wearing like
a leather jacket that has like gold on
the zipper I feel like it kind of
clashes with all of like my silver
accessories you know but this one sits
like a
black leather and then black on the
zipper it's like you can wear with any
color jewelry that you want and the way
it fits is so good like this lapel it
falls over here it's just like so edgy
but like glam the way this comes up and
fold like I'm obsessed and the fit is
great and then on the sides right here
the way kind of like comes out like a
little peplum when you zip it it gives
you like a really nice waist I mean
obviously I'm not gonna have a nice
waist right now in this poufy sweater
that I'm wearing but it's just so
flattering it's got a little bit of a
shoulder pad in there so it kind of
structures off your shoulders it's just
a good good jacket and the price is
hanging on me here right now it is $98
so just round out I'd say it's a hundred
dollars obviously it's a little more of
an expensive jacket you know it's gonna
be more pricey than something to get
like forever 21 or maybe hmm but this is
the type of jacket that I personally
have owned this jacket myself in my
closet and I still wear it and I've had
it for over four years I remember I
talked about this jacket and my vlogmas
I think four Christmases ago I think and
I bought it the year before that so
maybe five years I might have had it for
five years around there and this one I
just got and I got online because I'm
dying I purchased for myself so I don't
own this yet
he's a look at these sleeves you guys
you know that this jacket literally made
my heart drop I was so excited I didn't
try to on yet I'm so excited to this
jacket anytime blanket my see comes out
with a new jacket I get so excited and
this to me just like screams holiday
even though I will wear this all year
long I just love a sparkle I think I've
been a giant snowflake oh my god what
size is this this is a small and I could
honestly use an extra small in this this
one definitely runs a little bit big so
I'm glad I try to on for you guys cuz um
I mean it's an it's a really good fit
right now I feel like I'm gonna wear
like a sweater or something or any of it
but I could use it just a little bit
more fitted I just I love this style so
much and John loves it when I wear
jackets like this like come on this is
good this is good
I know those blank NYC jackets are not
wallet and budget friendly like not
just gonna be like walk out to the mall
today let me just spend $180 on a brand
new jacket poof no but like I really
wanted to recommend you guys jackets
that are gonna hold up and like stand
the test of time and you're gonna be
able to have four years going forward
and not just something that's gonna look
cute for the season and then you're
gonna have to get rid of it because it's
gonna start like bunching up and just
looking nasty like rippling like and to
me I have had actual experience so I can
put my mark of approval on blank NYC and
I think it's worth every penny
especially for a jacket that's gonna
keep you warm you're gonna be able have
four years and it's good quality okay so
now last but most Sweeting li not least
I have all of the beauty products first
things first I'm saying to get it out of
the way I think you guys all need this
this is the pad that I created with
morphe as you guys obviously know it has
my name right there this is the new and
improved packaging that they created a
for also specific Ulta for also stores
you can see right here it's like super
super glossy the whole thing is like
very shiny and on the back it has all of
the beautiful shades of the names 35
shades
mattes shimmers pops of colors and
neutrals all those beautiful Reds this
you need for the holidays and as long as
you're an alter you mind will just pop
over to the Becca section is grab a
champagne pop as well get those cheeks
popping okay even though they are
obviously mine I think these two
products are bomb products to give
friends for the holidays because
champagne pop is a universal highlight
shade and it is so beautiful even though
it's been out for so long and is still
so borders and I still wear it every
single week of my life I mix it with
every highlight that I ever put on and I
just love this formula this consistency
so much so I mean B there are good
products you guys I know she must plug
but I like them I might think a minute
to talk about color pop because I feel
that color pop is one of the best
inexpensive brands out there the price
point is absolutely incredible these
liquid lipsticks are only four dollars
and 20 cents for the girl out there who
loves makeup loves lipsticks color pop I
would say is the number one suggestion
that I have because they have such a
great range of everything like I was
just saying before make sure you guys
have used swatches of my favorite shades
for you first of all this is my number
one most worn colourpop lip color
hands-down
it is the Alexis red and color pop
collaboration it is one of their liquid
lips
it's in the shade little weapon it is
such a beautiful read but it's not like
a true Christmas read it's got like the
perfect like orange e pinky undertone in
it too it's so good anytime I wear this
I get asked constantly what I'm wearing
on my lips so good this is in the shade
magic wand this nude is such a good news
like it's not too white Pandu's and it's
not too Brown and then this I love this
shade this is in the shade trap which
this has a globe of a purple undertone
so pretty like this is like the perfect
Mavi lip color on someone who's really
fair like my skin tone right now this is
like this is the perfect bobby lip on me
right now
kathleenlights has a collaboration with
colour-pop she actually has several
different collabs like under their
umbrella of collapses several different
products and this is the shade point
zero and this is one of their liquid
lips and I absolutely love the shade if
you guys remember there was a minute
there where I was wearing this constant
Lee it's such a different color like
when I first put it on I was a girl but
I can pull this off and then I got
addicted it's like this beautiful brown
withing a little bit like what do you
have it on it's like almost a little bit
of a grey purple undertone but not too
much like where it's not like
unflattering that gets super flowering
so pretty
kathleen also has a gift set with color
pop as well and i believe this is 15
dollars for three different lippies so
this is kathleenlights trio right here
it's Aquarius Aquarius - and then the
Aquarius gloss right here these two
liquid lips are such good colors like
these are the kind of colors I can't
live without like if you don't have
these kind of colors like you need these
they're so good last but not least I
want to swap to the shade deeper because
beeper is such a popular color buy them
because it is like that perfect it's
kind of like a Kat Von D Lolita kind of
like bow-and-arrow shade right there
like that beautiful mauve like a little
bit of like that brownish kind of
reddish undertone in it it's so good I
sort of get color pops and love in this
video because it's such a great brand
for such an inexpensive price point but
you're getting such quality products and
it's like the perfect time of year you
know when you find that girl in your
life who just love
all things makeup you don't want to
break the bank color pop is a great
place to start
same thing with morphe of course I'm
gonna mention morphe especially this
palette right here because this palette
is limited edition and I asked Linda I'm
like wait is this for real limited
edition it's like I heard it was equated
this actually limited edition that she's
like yeah it's really limited edition
like once it's gone it's gone that we
are not reading and not learn more like
we are not going to or a more like once
it's done is done and I'll think so I
bought three for myself this is the
dream for a girl who loves eyeshadow
this is the dream palette and the best
part is it's $32 for all of this and you
guys it's quality eyeshadow it's not
like it's crap I shadow its bum and
they're full-sized normal eyeshadows and
in the center you have like these huge
mega shadows that are the size of like
makeup forever shadows like the pops of
color in this palette for some reason
really get me going let me show you like
can you see how creamy these swatches
are and how beautiful they go on like
look at this this is the eyeshadow path
I would recommend for the holidays if
you have anyone your life who loves
makeup $32 right here plus you can use a
discount code let's talk about a perfume
I'm absolutely in love with oh my god so
I have to say I definitely was like
excited to try Kim Kardashian's new
perfume but at the same time I was like
I don't know if I'm gonna like them
because I'm so crazy picky about sense
it's like ridiculous well she actually
sent this to me I did not purchase one
myself so this is a citrus one she came
out three different perfumes it was
gardenia citrus gardenia and gardenia
food I believe it was this scent like
I'm obsessed it's the only perfume I
have worn for the past like six days she
sent it to me
it's so good on Black Friday when she
restocked I got online and I bought her
other two cuz I'm so excited to try
those cuz I you never know I might get
them to be I hate them and give them
away or I might love them just as much
this is $60 for the bottle that I'm
holding right now and $35 for the
smaller bottle so it's not too crazy
expensive mattes not as expensive as you
know some designer perfumes but it's
just a great gift you know someone is
like super girly they love fragrance if
they love the Kardashians if they love
all that then this would be a great gift
for someone of course and it just smells
so dang good the only thing I will say
is I hate that the only way you can
store it is laying down inside like this
like it looks like a crystal which is
cool but like it's definitely like not a
room saver
I wish you could stand up oh she was
flat on the bottom you know that's the
only complaint that I have but that's
not a real complaint because the perfume
itself smells so good ok you guys my
obsession with this next product is so
beyond like it's gotten to the point
where I don't know if I can go to sleep
without it because I am so fully 100%
addicted and it is the sleepy body
lotion by lush you guys the scent it
says on the outside that is lavender
scented but I swear it smells like
lavender honey like it doesn't just know
like lavender
it smells like lavender honey like it
smells like there's equal parts of
lavender and equal parts of honey and
maybe like a splash of vanilla it is so
good and it's developed and designs like
put on your feet put on your body and
make you want to go to sleep with the
scent because of course lavender is a
very calming very sleepy time oil and
this I put it on every single night
before I go to bed I'll add on myself in
it if I take a nighttime shower or bath
I get out I lather myself from chin to
the tip of my toes and if I shower that
morning I don't shower before I go to
bed now let's put this on all over my
feet and I am obsessed I also wanted to
mention the Smashbox liquid lipsticks
just because these are some of the best
liquid lips in the game right now they
are so good I think not that me people
talked about them but they're like
ridiculously good like some of the best
out there I'm actually wearing one right
now I am wearing the shade bang-bang on
my lips currently it doesn't move like
it's perfect like and it doesn't give
you butthole lips immediately except
this is kind of running from me drinking
water I think other things like this are
so cute I was like stocking stuffers or
just putting am I gonna cute little
makeup bag and giving it to a friend
like some tinsel put in there like that
kind of stuff like I love that love
little gifts like that was like a couple
of different things in different places
I put into a cute bag like so that is it
you guys I really hope that you enjoyed
this video and you've got some good
ideas of course this video was not made
for you to be like oh my god I need a
specific thing but hopefully it like
opens up your mind to other ideas and
different options we can kind of run
from there and make it your own and just
have fun this Christmas buying things or
if you can't buy things guess what
that's ok I have had many many many
Christmases in my life where I put not
by anybody anything not my mom not my
dad don't let any of this bring you down
or feel sad on the holidays if you don't
have money to spend on others there
- phone on you because let's get real
that's not the season is about the
season is about something much more
important than anything that money can
buy and just always keep that in mind
the gift-giving is so much fun but
that's not what's really important and I
know I I get cheesy with you guys a lot
but it's the truth
