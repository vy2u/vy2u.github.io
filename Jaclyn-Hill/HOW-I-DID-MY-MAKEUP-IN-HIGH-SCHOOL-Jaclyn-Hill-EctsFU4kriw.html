exactly how I did my makeup in high
school for the past couple of days like
I went out and bought exact products I
used to use and I look through all these
old pictures to really make sure that
like I remembered everything perfectly
and it's accurate in an oh girl a buckle
up it's gonna be a bumpy ride
I'm actually really excited to do this
because I love laughing at myself if you
can't tell like my mom has always said
that if you can't laugh at yourself then
you're not living your life to the
fullest so a little background on high
school Jacqueline because you guys
obviously did not know me back then um I
was very loud and obnoxious and not like
so surprising right some things never
change I was technically homeschooled so
I didn't actually wear this makeup look
to high school because I go to high
school so I was home-schooled from the
age of from third grade all the way on I
actually started getting homeschooled
because I was very very badly bullied I
was beaten up pretty badly in public
school and my parents couldn't handle
all the bullying that was happening so
they pulled me out and start
homeschooling me and it worked out for
the best because my family ended up
doing a lot of traveling and I want to
have been able to go to school with all
the traveling that we did anyways I was
so bad at school like nothing made sense
to me I was never that kid that got a
gold star on the board I cried every day
because nothing made sense numbers were
so just like backward in my mind I would
learn something and be like yes I did it
the next morning I wake up and I would
forget it like it just sucks like I was
so bad at school and I had a dad who
always beat me down for being bad at
school like you've got to be smarter
you've got to be better at this and it
was very painful in that time I would
turn to makeup I would play with makeup
when I was 9 10 11 12 and all the way up
and it just made me feel normal and it
made me feel good about myself and it
made me feel like this is the thing that
I'm good at like it just made me feel
secure in myself so yeah so today's
video is going to be a walk down memory
lane of how I used to do my makeup oh my
god
it's so it's it's it's going to be a
 show you guys but you know what
it's gonna be fun just a quick
disclaimer this is basically going to
look like a mac cosmetics commercial
today
cuz I was going to go ahead and say it I
was a Mac whore
when I was in high school that's the
only makeup brand I even knew of like
there wasn't a Sephora near me we did
get a Sephora near me until I was like
18 years old I think um so when I was in
high school it was all about math like
everyone was like oh my god Mac like my
back foundation that's like I wanted to
grow up and be a Mac girl like that was
my goal I thought that they were like
the coolest girls ever like honestly so
I always had a full-time job sometimes I
had two jobs since I was home-schooled
like I worked constantly I worked at the
chick-fil-a drive-thru with the morning
shift yes hunty pouring that coffee at
6:00 a.m. I worked at a tanning bed for
like two years I got that job when I was
fifteen
um and I was so Orange because I tan all
the time so bad for your skin oh my gosh
so I tried to prom so I was Tanner last
night and make myself look his orders
possible about my hand so I wanted to
kind of like revisit the know I would
take 20% of my paycheck and put into
savings I would pay my cell phone bill
and then I would immediately go out and
buy makeup I would go to Mac and get a
lipstick get an eye shadow and get new
makeup that's why I sent my money on so
I'm gonna stop rambling and let's go
ahead and get started it's okay to zubi
wins like it's just feels so unnatural
so the first thing that I'm going to do
okay so the first thing that I'm going
to do is I'm going to take this shade
stick Mac doesn't actually make the
product I used to use I used to use a
shade stick in the shade Beijing I
believe it's called but this is a
prolong wear waterproof color stick but
it's basically the exact same thing it's
just like it replaced the shade stick
and it's basically just a stick that is
a primer so the first thing that I did
was I covered this all over my entire
lid area like all the way up into the
crease and I'll carve this out perfectly
and I always take you just a little bit
above the crease right there oh god this
is so bad
I already know like what this is gonna
look like and it's just not a good
situation you guys trying to match this
I tied it over there
your Heavenly Father please accompany me
to this difficult time so first thing
I'm gonna do first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm going to take Mac amber lights oh my
god I was obsessed I'm going to take a
flat synthetic brush I'm going to pack
this in on the inner corner of the eye
okay so next I'm going to take my
favorite Mac shadow ever and this is Mac
copper ring and I'm going to put this
right over the center of the lid like
right on top of amber lights I always
put this in the center of my lid because
I thought it was just like such a cool
pop of color and I love copper and I
always have I don't even want to tell
you what the next step is I just
oh my god okay so for the next step I'm
gonna go in with a matte black this is
Mac carbon I swear Mac Mac Mac I was so
obsessed just feels so wrong on every
single level
oh beast OBE said I'm going to do this
abort mission abort I thought this
looked good too I was like yeah bitch
this looks like Halloween all day every
day like I wore this on a Monday on a
Tuesday the funny part about all of this
is that like my friends thought this
looks good like my friends asked me to
do their makeup all the time and I was
like yeah girl I'll give you that copper
and black smokey eye now it is time for
eyeliner and back then I did not know
what a winged liner was that did not hit
until like 2010 so I went in with an eye
Kohl every day I used to do a big bold
line straight across so now I'm just
curling my lashes cuz back then I did
not wear false lashes it was all about
30 layers of mascara and curling my
lashes for 45 minutes the first time I
actually wore false lashes was on my
wedding day believe it or not and on my
wedding day I only had 20 minutes to do
my makeup
20 minutes if I had to read you my
wedding day now when I did my makeup
like I would give myself like an hour
and 45 minutes because I would be like
so nervous I'm like on my gonna has to
look perfect so I'm gonna go ahead and
put mascara on my lashes I loaded on the
mascara back then oh my gosh like I
would just put on mascara for hours so
now it is time for the lower lash line
and for the lower lash it used to be so
important to me that it was black as can
be I loved like that round really dark
kind of edgy like vampy blown out eye so
I'm going to line my entire honey I'm
going to line my entire waterline then I
would take a pencil brush and I would
blend that black kohl on a whole lower
lash line I'm going to grab a little bit
of the Mac copper ring and I would take
this and put this right under here right
on top of that just a little bit oh my
god okay so the eyes are now done don't
they look so good like hello so good so
now for the face I used to use the Mac
Studio Fix fluid foundation which I have
to say like I can't stand the
foundations like I really can't but I
love the smell but so much like this
weird thing every time I smell it just
takes me back to the best the best
memories in the best times I think where
that scent as a perfume I'm going to be
using the shade NC 30 today keep in mind
the back then I was the shade NC 42 42
because that's how tan I was on my
wedding day I was an NC 44 I'm going to
be using a paddle brush to apply this
because this was all the rage and this
was the only brush I use and I just me
and my friend who thought this brush was
just like so cool like we were like real
adults because we use this brush and
yeah I was going to go ahead and take it
on with absolutely no primer just going
for it now please keep in mind that back
then I did not use a darker shade like
right now I'm using a much darker shade
number 1 for the purpose of the video
and number 2 because
I sunless tan like I spray my body and
then I don't spray my face so I use a
foundation to match the color of my body
but back then my face was extremely tan
and I use the correct shade I didn't use
a darker one okay so that's done on the
most horrifying part of all is that I
did not wear concealer just Foundation
and I also didn't wear powder just
foundation but I did bronze not just any
bronzer but a bronzer with sparkle in it
all right here we go just directly in I
would put it all over my cheeks as blush
oh god oh god all right and now for lips
my favorite lipstick of all time when I
was in high school was Mac high tea I
was obsessed like obsessed alright so
let me just go ahead and throw on my
blonde wig to really take it back to the
good old days and I'll be right back yes
girl stop it right now
okay now we are really taking it back to
the high school days even though this
wig is not on point it needs a little
help
makes me miss being blonde honestly it's
sunny cos so many people like always say
to Jonna and me like it's so surprising
that we're together because like I'm so
girly and glam he's still like rocker
and covered in tattoos and he's a
drummer but maybe this will help you
guys understand a little bit more like
this is where like I originated and I
still feel like myself I know it sounds
weird but I still feel like myself when
I'm dressed like this like I used to
have a nose piercing and a lip piercing
and I went to every single like rock
band show there was I was like front row
like brand-new and take me back Sunday
and I was like I just can't believe I
didn't do my brows like what I did not
my brausen was crazy that my brows
actually looks so much better now back
then they were like little like what do
they call like little sperms they're
like like they were so skinny and they
were like a block in here that like it
was very very sad um but yeah I mean
it's crazy I didn't do blush I didn't do
concealer I didn't I did a highlight I'm
sorry I need a minute
anyways you guys I really hope that you
enjoy this video thank you so much for
watching and I love you and I will see
you in a couple of days mmm hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
