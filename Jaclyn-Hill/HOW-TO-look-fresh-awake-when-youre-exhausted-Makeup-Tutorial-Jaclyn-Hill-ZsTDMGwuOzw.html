I actually have no idea what I'm calling
this yet but basically I'm doing this
video because I woke up this morning
absolutely exhausted I got the worst
night's sleep last night because me my
best friend we're up until past 5:00 in
the morning watching the first season of
Gossip Girl this is my life so because
of that I was miserably exhausted all
day today running on a few hours of
sleep and just dragging my lifeless body
just miserable and so when it came time
to filming I was like no it's gonna be
so hard cuz it takes many hours to film
sometimes and I tweeted you guys about
how tired I was and someone's going to
be back telling me that I should do a
video of how to look more fresh and
awake when you're exhausted and I was
like yes I love it so I typically don't
just like randomly do a video like spur
the moment like this I usually like know
what I'm going to do like 24 hours in
advance but I figured why not so I've
set on front of the camera did my hair
did my makeup got dressed why didn't get
dressed on camera this isn't that kind
of video even if you don't want to do
this exact makeup look I will give you
tips that will work for everybody all
skin tones all eye colors all that jazz
that will guarantee you took more fresh
in the wake on a daily basis some of
these things are just common sense and
some are makeup artist tips and I will
list all of the tips that I have for you
guys down below I'll link in my
description bar that way in case I want
to tell you something that I didn't
mention in the video you can go ahead
and read that lit lips read that list
for yourself to look more fresh and
awake on a daily basis yeah so I hope
you guys enjoy this video thank you so
much for watching I love you guys and
I'll see you soon bye
so first step and looking good is
cleansing your skin you want to make
sure that you really rinse your face
well in the morning because when you're
tired your skin can get very dehydrated
and this will help with that
also turn your water on all cold when
you get towards the end and use cold
water on the face because that will
really help waking you up and it will
also help waken up the skin as well then
I'm going to moisturize my skin I cannot
emphasize enough how important it is to
moisturize your face it's going to help
your makeup lay so beautifully and it's
going to also hydrate the skin making it
plumper and more awake I also use an eye
cream day and night just make sure that
it's not too thick and creamy otherwise
it can interfere with your concealer
then I'm going to take some
freezing-cold spoons and put it on my
under-eye bags yes this works you pop
two spoons in the freezer you can leave
them in there for 10-15 minutes or you
can leave them in there overnight put
them on your under eye area and it will
seriously not only wake you up but truly
deep puff that under-eye area then I'm
going to go in with rotos eye drops
these are extremely cooling and chilling
they feel like you're in the Arctic and
these literally give your eyes a zing
and you feel completely awake then I'm
going to go in with the Evian mineral
water and just spray that on my face and
with these steps you are literally like
ready to conquer the day yep got to do
one more time
felt too good not to go on yep Bing Bing
Bing connect the dots so cute I am going
to be using bare minerals bare skin
foundation and I'm going to be applying
that with a makeup geek foundation brush
I'm using three to four drops for my
entire face I have never used a
foundation where so little go so far if
that makes sense this is kind of a dewy
foundation on me personally and on days
where you're tired you really want to
use a foundation that's hydrating it can
be as full coverage or sheers you want
but a hydrating foundation is really
going to help make you look fresh and
awake as opposed to a matte foundation
can sometimes make you look a little bit
older and then actually weigh down the
skin
I am so falling asleep right now not
even going to lie now I'm going to go in
under my eye area
and just correct and conceal it looks
like I'm applying a lot well that's
because I am applying a lot but this
concealer is on the sheer side so when I
blend it out it's not going to be as
intense but I am going to go over the
eyelid area and under-eye area using a
damp Beauty Blender because in real life
I truly am exhausted as I'm filming this
and so I'm taking all the steps that I
take when I am exhausted and using a
damp Beauty Blender really helps make
that under-eye area not look dry or
creepy like it can get when you're tired
now I'm going to highlight the face I
would typically use my Mac prep and
prime highlighter and light boost but
I'm currently out of that so instead I'm
trying out the YSL to chic la radiant
touch and I have to say it's really not
that big of a difference but I'm just
highlighting the points of my face I
want to bring light to and this is going
to help us look much more fresh and
again awake by highlighting I am
blending that out again with a damp
Beauty Blender because having it damp
and that water in that sponge is going
to help press and more moisture and
hydrate our skin and that is all we're
looking for when we're tired as
hydration hydration hydration then I'm
going to set my under eye concealer you
don't have to do this but it is a
personal must for me because my
concealer will move no matter what
concealer is if I do not set my under
eye area so I'm using the Anastasia
contour kit in the banana shade and I'm
also using emphasize by Mac Pro I will
link all of that good stuff down below
now I'm going to go in with the Bobbi
Brown eyeshadow in the shade
using a sigma fluffy brush I'm going to
take this all over in that crease area
using a shade like this is going to
bring dimension to the eye without being
too intense or overboard and it's going
to really help make you look more awake
and make those eyes look more open then
I'm going to jump in with a new Milani
eyeshadow in the shade below cappuccino
I'm going to use a smaller more dense
brush for this part and I'm going to
really focus this on that outer corner
putting that darker shade out there is
going to give me more depth again in
more dimension and bring more attention
to the eyes then I'm going to go in with
another Milani eyeshadow and Bella
champagne and I'm using my fingers
because I was just over brushes I was
exhausted and I was just not feeling it
so I'm using my fingers to apply the
shade all over the lid area and I'm also
going to jump in with L'Oreal iced
latté and just put a pop of that right
in that inner corner because it's super
super shimmery and this will really help
bring
tons of attention to that eye area and
really waking you up if you are more
mature and you don't want to use shimmer
I always suggest Mac mylar eyeshadow
it's beautiful then I'm going to fill in
my brows nothing special and comb them
out as always I'm going to go in with
Mac shroom eyes shadow because this is
my personal favorite highlight of all
time and I'm going to highlight that
brow bone area and then I'm also going
to highlight my inner corner you could
use the L'Oreal iced latté but for me
personally it's a little too chunky for
under brow and inner corner highlight I
like those highlights to be very fine
and shimmer and very glowy with no
chunkiness whatsoever then I'm going to
curl my lashes you can use whatever lash
curler you have but this is a very
important step in making yourself look
awake taking your lashes and bringing
them upward is going to make the eyes
appear larger and bigger
therefore more awake then I'm going to
coat the lashes with Maybelline pumped
up colossal I'm going to go with two
coats and I usually let the lashes dry
for about one minute in between coats
I'm clearly feeling more awake it's
working people then I'm going to go in
with Bella cafe this is another Milani
eyeshadow I got a little happy the
drugstore okay now is going to buff this
on the whole lower lashline area a lot
of times people get nervous to do this
but doing this will actually help you
look more awake
leaving that under-eye area blank can
actually do the reverse and make them
look more squinty therefore more tired
then I'm going to coat that inner
waterline with this NARS rue Bonaparte I
believe and it's a creamy white and it's
going to make the eyes open up even more
using a stock white can be a little too
much so I always love using a creamy one
then putting that mascara on the bottom
as you can see it just finishes off and
makes the eyes look much bigger then I'm
going to go in with Mac care blend
powder and the shade medium deep this is
technically a face powder talked about
tons of times before but it's one of my
favorite ways to bronze the skin of
all-time and I'm going to buff that out
with a big ol blending brush but first I
did do a little contour action with the
makeup geek contour brush I'm not sure
what it's called exactly but I will link
it down below then I'm going to go in
with the hourglass what is this ambient
lighting powder and luminous lights and
a tapered highlighting brush from Sigma
and I'm going to put that all over the
cheekbone area once I have on the cheek
area I'll also touch it on the chin
Cupid's bow the very top of the nose
very
very lightly you do not want to bring
too much attention in the center of the
forehead if you're not oily and then I'm
going to go in with a blush from Becca
and this is flower child it is such a
beautiful pink I really recommend using
a pink tone blush when you are feeling
tired because it'll make your cheeks
just glow and make you look more awake
and fresh as opposed to using just
bronzer or something more coral I am
going to go in with urban decay native
lipstick which is just a beautiful nude
baby pinkish and I'm going to go over it
with this girl lactic lip gloss that I
am obsessed with right now and yet I
don't know the name of the color so I
will link it down below but as you can
see it's gorgeous using a lip gloss when
you're trying to make yourself look more
fresh in a wig is very important because
it reflects the light off of the lips
and therefore makes you look a little
bit more feminine and awake I'm going to
just take a tiny little Sigma liner
brush and just barely coat that lash
line with some black gel liner I'm not
actually lining the eyes I'm just
putting some of this liner in those
lashes just again to bring a little bit
more dimension I'm going to set
everything with Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray this will help everything
look much more natural now I'm going to
quickly just do my hair there were so
many requests for a hair tutorial in my
last video so I figured that I would
just show you how I did it because it's
so stinkin simple my hair is naturally
straight but if I have any kinks from it
being up in a bun I'll just quickly
straighten it out I am using my Bellamy
hair straightener I will link it down
below then I'm just grabbing a section
of my hair and as you can see I'm not
doing the greatest at it kind of is
hurting me and then I'm just going to
grab the pieces around that entire face
area pull it back over top of the ears
this is really a moment where you can
decide how much you want personally in
my last video I didn't pull this much
back but today I switched it up a little
bit I was just feeling a little crazy
I'm going to clip half of it back just
to get it out of the way and then that
front half that I have right there all
I'm going to do is just lightly tease it
just to give this section a little bit
of body but I don't want it to be like
baboom I just want it to have a little
bit of body in the front of that head
that head and the front of that Fathead
in the front of my head and then I'm
just going to go ahead and twisty tie it
back like that then I will just tighten
it so that comes up a little bit higher
on the head
then I grab a random piece of hair from
right underneath of it and I wrap wrap
wrap that way you can't see that twisty
tie because sometimes that's just not a
cute look and this is an easier way to
make it look a little bit cuter without
having to try too hard I bobby pin that
baby down and we are good to go this
totally reminds me my like Flintstones
I call it my Flintstones hairdo but what
can you say I just threw on a more
colorful t-shirt because wearing color
and your wardrobe or your accessories in
any way is going to help you look a
little bit more fresh and awake it
brings attention to you in a positive
way it makes you look a little bit more
youthful and playful so I really hope
that you guys enjoy this tutorial thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
