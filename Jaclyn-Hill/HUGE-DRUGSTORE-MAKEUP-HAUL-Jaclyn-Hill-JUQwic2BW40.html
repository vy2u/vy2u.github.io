today's video because it is something I
have never done before on my channel
which is so weird right and kind of
unacceptable um but yeah first of all I
changed up my location I'm in the exact
same room as I have been for the past
six months but on my last video where I
had the purple paper backdrops I'm kind
of fighting purple paper um
so many people told me that they just
prefer my natural home in my background
and not a backdrop and I completely
agree it felt so weird to fill in that
video it just didn't feel like me and
just my surroundings and I was kind of
uncomfortable editing it it took me like
several days to edit it cuz I'm just
kind of like oh I just didn't feel right
so hopefully you guys enjoy a more real
background because this is my Beauty
room right now I'm just sitting in the
corner kind of weird the things that
youtubers do like why am I just sitting
in the corner and now with lights and
cameras facing me it's so weird anyways
for today's video I'm going to be doing
a drugstore makeup on so I'm excited to
be doing this I was actually snapping
about a week ago or so and I was just
talking about how I had just spent so
much money at the drugstore and I was so
excited I was gonna start doing some
first impressions of drugstore makeup
cuz I've had so many requests for drug
store looks recently anyways as I was
talking to guys on snapchat I had kind
of like a lightbulb moment and I was
like oh my gosh you know what I should
do is actually do a drugstore makeup
haul and then put my first impressions
using that makeup and when I said that
I'm not even joking I got so many snaps
from you guys that my snapchat literally
froze and shut down like literally shut
down and I couldn't get it to open back
up like five minutes my phone got really
hot which happens maybe every like six
months or so when you guys like get
really excited about something and the
snaps start flooding so hard so I was
like alright if that's not a sign I
don't know what is that's when you know
what's real I've got a Hema makeup haul
for you guys so I have a lot of products
the first box that I have is in Ulta
calm order that I plays just because
there's not almost like right next to me
it's like a 45-minute drive to the
closest Alta so I ordered a pretty large
order several hundred dollars worth from
Ulta calm and I have here in a box and
then I also went to just like my local
Walgreens or CVS right down the street
all right you guys gonna dive into this
box I'm gonna pull things out and just
talk about it as we go there might not
be any rhyme or reason but
hey it's makeup so we're gonna have a
good time all right all right okay so
one of the main things I was determined
to get was this positions formula butter
blush because I love the positions
formula butter bronzer so when I saw
these came out I saw on Instagram that
they had just launched and I was super
excited to try that maybe I should say
this for the first impressions video but
I don't really care I'm so naughty I
want to smell it now on camera because
the bronzer has the most amazing that
coconutty like paradise smell hold on
hold on I'm really excited yeah this
just smells like paradise like this I
want to take this brush just on a
tropical vacation and be like mmm that's
right mm-hmm okay so speaking of
luscious I got a couple of L flushes and
I got three me too I only got two yeah I
guess I only got two I have actually
tried the elf blushes and like the quad
there's like a palette that comes with
four blushes and I used to love that
quad actually I use it quite often so I
wanted to try their individual blushes
as well cuz I've never tried these my
favorite blushes from the drugstore
hands-down are the Knicks blushes I love
that said really small and square and
they are so pigmented they feel so
high-end not the packaging necessarily
but the actual product itself which
honestly guys that's a big thing at the
trip I'm like destroying this I'm
ripping it open but that's a big
difference between drugstore and more
like high-end products is the packaging
is usually a little bit cheaper and
typically at the boxes they come in as a
little bit cheaper and that's how they
are able to save their money and keep
the price so low put the formula on the
inside you never know sometimes it can
be made in the exact same labs as these
high-end bougie brands
you never know working behind the scenes
in some labs recently I have gotten to
find some stuff that I'm just like oh
yes okay that feels nice this one is in
the shade mellow mom that's really
pretty I really love the formula because
it just feels really creamy and it
honestly feels kind of like a hydrating
kind of like moisturizing feel which in
my opinion is usually the most beautiful
looking blushes and bronzers when they
feel really hydrating and really creamy
I was like there's a lot of water in it
and that's what this one feels like
right here and it's it's got like a
sheen to it but no no glitter not on the
face I like glitter on the eyes all day
our day for not
so I finally got this elf baked
highlighter I have been so excited to
try this it's always sold out at my
target so I just ordered it on Ulta calm
and I've heard so many good things about
this from you guys it is in the shade
movement pearls there's been a lot of
like reviews from people saying that the
first initial swatch is really bad and
you have to like get to the top layer
yeah because there's literally no swatch
like at all but I've seen a lot of
people say that you have to like dig
through I want to scrape this off but
I've heard that like if you get to the
top layer like if you scrape it off I've
heard that it's like beautiful
underneath I'm getting this one cheapo
in the back of my hand I'm really
excited to actually try this this will
probably be the highlight that I use in
my first impressions I got a couple of
highlighting products and I'm going to
wait I got the elf naked prism eyeshadow
palette so much yes
oh my god even when I was a little girl
I never have used these I always said
these things away I'd rather use my
fingers you guys this looks so pretty
okay I'm so excited to swatch hold on
hold on hold on please be please be good
please be good else please fun guys I'm
getting a little horny okay so some of
these are swatching better than others
but this is promising like these
swatches are looking pretty good they're
like very metallic they're not like a
shimmer or I don't know how to explain
it but they have like this really really
intense metallic almost like foiled but
they're like a sheer foil but like it's
got pigment in there oh my god I'm
really excited about this this would
honestly be really beautiful on the
cheeks
I bet because I actually have a sleek
palette that is in this exact same
packaging pretty much and very similar
and it's what I used to highlight today
and this reminds me a lot of it so I bet
that this would be a gorgeous cheek
highlight palette I mean I just like
doing I like using eyeshadows as
highlights and blushes and stuff like
that so I ordered several different
things from NYX and one of the things
that I'm most excited about for sure is
this eyeshadow palette and when it came
in the mail but I busted it open and
broke this blue shot
but just doing like a few little like
finger swatches these look really
promising like I'm really excited let me
do this blue one that actually broke hey
but I'm really really looking forward to
using these like they look so oh they're
really exciting me especially in that
top row oh girl you know that top row is
screaming at my name I got a little
Nick's flawless finish blending sponge
just because I'm always curious about
trying new Beauty sponges I've tried a
lot of them at this point now and my
favorite one is still by morphe their
newest one because of the shape I love
it so much but I'm always down to try
new sponges and I was oh it feels nice
and I like how it's flat on one side see
how one size rounded like the original
Beauty Blender and then this side is
straight that's what I love about the
morphe sponge is that it has one side is
completely straight because I love that
to really get like underneath your eye
on your face I like that flatness so
that is promising in the texture feels
really nice too honestly feels pretty
similar to the original Beauty Blender
so you see one of the things I am most
excited about is this NYX total control
drop foundation I got it in several
different shades because I cannot wait
to try this I just have a good feeling
about it and I took one out and I
dropped it on the back of my hand and it
looks like I mean I have it feeling I'm
gonna like it I just do and then NYX
actually sent me this package in the
mail which I was kind of freaking out
over because it's a collaboration
between NYX in Ferriss ollie
farce elite I don't know you guys I'm
not trying to be disrespectful
I don't know how to actually pronounce
it but I'm so excited because it's like
that little unicorn dropping thing that
everyone uses on Instagram you know and
like they like drop it all over their
face and blend in their foundation it's
cream sauce
so I want to use this in my next video
for sure when I drop this all over my
face like all the cute girls on
Instagram and then use the NYX total
cover foundation over top and see how it
goes and also can't like a little brush
too so I'm really excited about that so
now I definitely will have my shade
because they sent me this which is
awesome Thank You NYX and then I also
picked out one two three four shades
online because I didn't know what my
Shay was gonna be and if I end up loving
a foundation I always like to have
several shades just so I have my color
when I'm light when I'm dark when I'm
tan I can also use it to contour like
cream bronzer and all that jazz so I got
four shades there another foundation I
think I'm gonna love I don't know I've
had these Ives you know I had these good
vibes like these foundations and it is
the Milani conceal and perfect
two-in-one foundation and concealer I
honestly feel like someone has raved
about this I don't know who is on
YouTube somewhere maybe or I don't know
but I took a pump of this on the back of
my hand
and just the swatch I was like oh my god
it is so much coverage it's definitely a
little too dark for me right now but
just like a little pump it feels so
creamy you guys like this does not feel
like any drugstore foundation that I
have ever used this feels so high-end
and so luxurious and then another
foundation I'm excited about so this is
the Maybelline fit me foundation and is
the dewy plus smooth one so I'm excited
about this because it's a dewy
foundation from the fit me line which I
love fit me but I also get nervous about
trying three foundations especially now
I'm getting a little bit older I know
I'm not old
obviously I'm only 27 26 oh my god I'm
26 I'm turning 27 in July I need to go
together the older that I get like the
more skin issues I have it I'm not 18
anymore my skin is not perfect like a
baby's ass like I do have a little fine
lines and I do have little wrinkles I do
have a little bit of texture so using
like dewy foundations it's
hit or miss sometimes it's amazing and
sometimes I'm like I got the NYX HD
studio photogenic concealer I've heard
great things about this as well I
actually believe I own this but it's
really old I bought it a long time ago
so I started to get a new one cuz I
don't know if I ever even tried it I
think I bought it and then just put it
somewhere I forgot about it which I hate
it when I do that it really bothers me
but this is the concealer I'm most
excited to try I remember back in the
day like back in like the old days here
on YouTube back in olden days this is
the concealer that everyone raved about
I also got the NYX angel veil skin
perfecting primer this is oil free too
because I have heard so many people say
that this is the best drugstore primer
and I personally love the L'Oreal Lumi
primer I don't think of the L'Oreal Lumi
primer makes a foundation lasts longer
or anything like that or like makes your
pores look better but I just think that
it makes your foundation look very
beautiful and luminous and that's always
been like my main thing is I just want
my skin not to look dry and then I got
the NYX micro brow pencil just because
so many people have told me that this is
an amazing dupe for the Anastasia brow
Wiz which I used to be right or die for
the brow is before I got obsessed with
the brow definer so I want to try that
one I think I have tried it before in
the past and it did not work for me at
all and I had so many comments when
people saying I must have gotten a bad
one because they typically aren't like
that so it could've been like an old
dried out one that happened to the other
shelf for a long time I don't know but
we're gonna try it again you guys told
me on Twitter that the Rimmel lip
pencils are amazing so I just got two
colors oh yes these look so nice it's
not color right there that color is my
jam for sure this is in the shade
0 for 9 natural and then I also got 45
cafe nut we ate something Wow yeah these
are really really creamy oh my gosh I
put all of my oh my god Walgreens stuff
into a Amazon box because it was so much
I was like I can't keep this stuff in
bags anymore it's just
I already opened a couple things up in
here not too many but a couple things
just cuz I was excited I wanted to
swatch them and this is the Physicians
Formula bronze booster it says it's the
airbrushing bronzing veil deluxe edition
in the shade light to medium so I
thought this was gonna be lighter and
when I saw it in person it is too dark
for me but I will say the formula and
the color would look gorgeous on deeper
skin tones for all of the darker
complexion
ladies and gentlemen out there watching
this like that chocolate skin tone this
will look so beautiful like it really is
gorgeous I just won't work on me I did
pick up some lashes and these are the
ardell demi wispies lashes I've heard
everyone say that these are like the
best lashes from the drugstore so I
thought why not give them a shot they
look like they're really natural and you
know my bitch ass I typically don't do
the whole natural situation I've got
another highlighter this is like a
shimmer strip from the brand revolution
yes and it's called the shimmer brick a
radiant I think kathleenlights might
have talked about this I might be wrong
but I think she did and it swatches
really really beautifully the only like
yeah the highlighting power is really
gorgeous the only thing is I don't know
if this is gonna work for my skin tone
because the overall highlight seems like
it's gonna be maybe a little bit too
dark for me but the highlighting power
is beautiful so if you are more of like
a golden bronze color or have a deeper
skin tone I would definitely grab this
for a highlighter from the drugstore
because like I said the formula on the
swatch is gorgeous like really truly
gorgeous but I just think that it might
be a little too dark for my skin tone I
got the Maybelline strobing a liquid
these look amazing look at that right
there
it's like the metallic it's kind of like
um the custom cover FX drops that are
really metallic but this is just a
little bit more sheer doesn't have as
much of like a punch to it I got the
Maybelline master camo color correcting
kit which I was actually really excited
about because I have in color correcting
on and off recently my under eye area
especially when I'm fair just because I
can have like really intense dark
circles like the more fair that I get
like they peek through more so I was
excited to try
this is really really really really
creamy I prefer them to be a little bit
more on the dry side just because
they're gonna sit underneath the
concealer and foundation so when they're
so creamy they're gonna break up your
foundation um and a little bit more
pigmented these don't have too much
pigments my favorite are the Make Up For
Ever ones as far as like amazing color
correcting power they are the best in my
opinion I got another pair of ardell
lashes which I was I am the most excited
for these are the double up double
dummies and they look really really
sassy these are the ones I plan on using
it first because these look like they're
gonna be awesome I got the Maybelline
master fix setting perfecting loose
powder this is it's at sass sets
mattifies blurs and smooth so I'm really
excited try this to just look like it
trance as a powder to me so I thought
that when I did my first impressions if
I have to bake this is what I shall use
instead of my coverfx or my RC ma they
did not fill this up all the way okay so
I just realized a lot of the stuff that
I purchased at Ulta is in this box right
now that was supposed to just be my
Walgreens and CVS stuff but somehow it
got into here because I have some NYX in
here to have some elf in here like this
stuff was not at my CVS and Walgreens so
whatever it is what it is it's all a
drugstore you get to point I got the NYX
HD finishing powder in the shade banana
just cuz I was really excited to try a
banana car from the drugstore because
I've never tried that before
and I love a good banana powder it all
started with the Ben Nye banana powder
that was like my first obsession and
then it went from that to all different
ones so any banana powder I'm always
willing to try I got the elf
illuminating palette which I'm excited
to try this because I used to love their
blush palette that looked exactly like
this then I got this mad format
eyeshadow palette that is all brown
shades which is why I was so interested
in it sounds like yes give me that
neutral eyeshadow palette these swatches
do feel kind of creamy some of them are
more pigmented than others but they do
feel like they are creamy so therefore
they are promising and then this one is
the elf baked eyeshadow palette and it
is called California I want to open this
one
right now this palette looks flippin
gorgeous are you kidding me these colors
wait okay so this feels exactly like the
highlighter did so that tells me that I
probably have to scrape off the top
layer because the very top layer
literally has no swatch like the that's
like nothing right there do some
scraping and see if that makes it any
better this is the Maybelline master
prime face primer and it's supposed to
blur and illuminate and I was like ooh
it's like very rare that you hear primer
is gonna blur and illuminate typically
you hear blur and mattify cuz it's gonna
like really smooth you out and mattify
you down so blur illuminate I was like
okay then I got to face palette by
Maybelline this is the master contour
face contouring kit contour a blush and
a highlight the highlight doesn't look
like it's actually gonna highlight me
the way I wanted to but that contour
color looks really really promising so
I'm hoping that that would be a good
shade this on the other hand I'm so
excited for and this is the master blush
palette it says its color and
highlighting kits these blushes look
amazing and I cannot wait to use these
that highlight has some pigment in it I
also got the Loreal blush palette which
looks so dope it's got like a little
brush right here oh my god this brush is
so cute I can like be me me me me four
shades that look so beautiful so bright
and vivid let me do a swatch yes I've
got another Physicians Formula products
and this said that it is nude and is the
highlighting and contour palette which
I'll be really would not use this to
contour because it has three different
shades in it and all three shades are
very shimmery so I will use this only
specifically for highlighting just me
personally it looks like this it's like
a little door you think it's so cool
let's see Oh beast okay well for all the
fair girls out there honey I just found
your drugstore highlight here it is
Physicians Formula this is a wet and
wild eyes shadow palette in the shade
poster-child
I love house is a brow bone eyelid
crease definer
yes give it to me wow so cute but I
still love these colors I love these
bright colors it reminded me a little
bit of the poor girl there's so much
stuff here a little bit of the Knicks
one right here except the next one I'm
more excited about because the colors
are like way more like and vivid and
intense but yeah I wanted to try this
out - I got a Milani lipstick in the
shade match naked because I love little
Milani boilin I can't talk to Milani lip
six these Milani lip sticks used to have
a really weird scent and they don't
smell like that maybe I'll just like a
specific collection that had a weird
sense that I used to have but this
smells really good Milani lipsticks are
one of my favorites Milani and
Maybelline they're both really beautiful
from the drugstore and look at that
color that's so pretty and it's matte it
doesn't have any shimmer in it any
glitter whatsoever and it's nice and
pigments and then I got the Loreal
infallible it says it is new and it says
it's up to 16 hour where silky I pencil
in the shade true teal I just love this
color just popped out to me on the wall
when I was at the drugstore and I wanted
to see the pigmentation because I don't
know why I don't wear oh my god yes
speaking of teal I got a couple of them
got several actually I got four of them
and they are from the L'Oreal infallible
paints it says and they are eyeshadow so
this one right here is in the shade mint
detox and it has two different sides so
one side is literally like a paint that
looks intense like that right there like
so pigmented right and then the other
side over here is a metallic paint like
look and how cool that is
like isn't that awesome I kind of like
some champagne shades and like peachy
shades and orange e1 and then this mint
one which is mint one is just like so so
cool I got this mua makeup academy a lip
gloss it's called the luminizing lip
gloss in the shade
1:08 nude and i already tried it on and
I really liked it I only wore maybe 10
minutes around my house but you guys
this packaging is so heavy if you feel
so luxe and it's so big and thick that's
what she said and the color is gorgeous
and look at happy ones that is one swipe
I got the Loreal infallible eight hour
ProGlide I was really excited
shei because it reminded me so much of
the lancome mirrored nude the gloss I
was like raving about recently which is
obviously this is like a core of the
price where am i squatching at this
point this is a hot mess
um okay so it's definitely not as
metallic but it's a really beautiful to
like sheer gloss with like a little bit
of shimmer underneath of it which looks
really pretty and eight hour I'm like
damn that's a bold statement eight hour
wear and a gloss that's crazy I got this
Milani a more matte lip cream so kind of
like a liquid lipstick but a more cream
so creamy in the shade adorable and I
love this color look how pretty that is
I tried this on the other night as well
work first a few minutes around my house
but it looked really nice I'm really
excited about this I got another Milani
lipstick in the shade matte innocence
which this color looks so pretty
let me see yes I love that pinky nude
okay last but not least I got the
Maybelline master fix
