you're gonna win are seven of my
favorite Sigma brushes I'm going to show
you that I am NOT gonna take them out of
their plastic because these right here
are going to be going to one of the
winners so I gotta keep it sanitary
you're going to be getting in the f80
flat top kabuki brush which is what I
use for foundation everyday in my life
you're gonna be getting the f-86 tapered
kabuki brush this is not technically a
concealer brush but that's what I use it
for it you'll love it you're gonna be
getting the e-40 which is a blending
brush and then you're going to be
getting the e25 which is just a smaller
bending bending brush a blending brush
they are both absolutely amazing the e55
just to pack whatever color you want all
over your lips you're going to get that
pencil brush which is the e30 to blend
everything out and then you're going to
get into f70 which is technically a
concealer brush but I have to have this
to do my under brow highlight and my
inner corner highlight so that's what I
use in that baby for so seven of my
favorites these right here you can
pretty much do your entire face with
these seven brushes not pretty much you
can you can do your entire face with
these different brushes since we started
with the brushes I'm going to just
continue on with face products the first
thing is the set the SAP Smashbox Sun
Tan matte bronzer I had a really
difficult time picking out a bronzer
because I don't know what undertone and
what skin tones the winners are going to
have so because of that I
to get something that is very Universal
in Smashbox a suntan mat looks really
great on a very wide variety of skin
tones if you're very fair you're gonna
want to apply a very small amount and if
you're much more tan and this gets very
pigmented and very dark and it has a
neutral undertone it's not really laying
on the oranga terracotta side or the
right side it's pretty much in between
and is a matte bronzer so it's great for
contouring as well by the way any
swatches that you see me doing are from
my personal collection I am NOT going to
be opening or touching or swatching any
other products that are gonna be going
to my winners next I'm going to be
giving away Mac margin blush again I had
a very difficult time picking out a
blush I was all over the place I was
like maybe I should get this one from
Becca but I couldn't get any from Becca
because they're all sold out so I went
with Mac margin this is one of my
favorite blushes of all time it has a
beautiful shimmer in it it's a very
light shimmer and the thing I love about
this blush it's from very fair girls to
extremely dark girls you can all wear
this if you're really fair it's gonna be
more like a bronzy peachy color and if
you're super dark it's gonna look a
little bit more like a highlight almost
like an inner glow so it's beautiful on
everybody when I worked at Mac I sold
this blush all day every day it's so
gorgeous so margin by Mac then for the
highlighter I'm going to be giving away
mary lou manizer by the ball this is one
of my favorite highlighters ever don't
you say that because these are all like
my top favorite products so Mary they
were metal
mary lou manizer by the balm it's just
absolutely beautiful the reason I chose
this one is because it really is going
to look good on everybody no matter how
fair or tan this will it wore this on
you and it will last forever it is so
extremely pigmented that you only have
to use a tiny amount so you really get
in the bang for your buck out of this
product right here so mary lou manizer
by the balm then you are all the way to
get Urban Decay all nighter makeup
setting spray this is a setting spray
that is going to help your makeup last
much longer help with the longevity and
also help it set and look a little bit
more natural on the skin I got you the
one ounce bottle because I wanted to get
you the big size bottle of you know this
or the chill settings breaks I love them
both I could not get eight of them they
were
and my sores I couldn't get them online
it was very aggravating so I just got
you guys the one ounce bottle instead
because I thought I would rather get you
guys something
then nothing when it comes to a setting
spray so I got to the Urban Decay all
nighter and since it's one ounce you can
fly with it and travel with this so
that's convenient
get in there sorry who's ever box this
is I'm like being a little rough and
then sticking with the face you are also
going to be getting the purity a face
wash this is the one-step facial
cleanser and this is the three fluid
ounce so it's not like the big bottle
but it's also not like the big maybe one
that they have but this is just an
amazing base watch I've talked about it
so many times here on my channel I
absolutely love it it is so gentle and
it takes off every piece of makeup I've
never heard anybody tell me that they
don't like this or that like broke their
skin out or dried their skin out it's
great for all skin tones all skin all
skin tones all skin types clearly any
skin tone could use a face wash but it's
great then I got you guys both of the
glam glow face masks well they have more
than two but these are my favorites so I
got you guys the glam glow super mud
clearing treatment which is really great
for pulling out blackheads whiteheads
dirt bacteria all of that this is great
for people who have also issues with oil
and I also got to the thirsty mud which
is a very hydrating mask so I could not
decide between these because I'm like
well what if they're oily what if my
winners dry so I was like I'm getting
both
so I actually love both of these I love
using this one to really clean my skin
and the following day I'll go in with a
hydrating one oh they are a match made
in heaven
since I am more dry honestly the thirsty
mud is my favorite but everybody's
different I love them both so I hope you
guys love them too I'm sweating so much
whatever powering through you are of
course going to be getting my two lip
glosses that I created which are butter
cream and Rose Hill and then along with
these two you are also going to be
getting my other three favorite lip
glosses by lightning lightning which are
coral crazed new and pink tiara
honestly you guys with these five lip
glosses right here you really aren't
going to need any other color like these
are going to take care of you for a
while
and the
Cinci is so beautiful I'm telling you
whoever one of these you're gonna be in
the gloss heaven then you are also going
to be winning Mac angel lipstick just
because this is one of my favorite
lipsticks ever obviously it is so
beautiful it is a really nice creamy
pink and it's not too pink where some
people can't wear it
it's a pink that really everyone can
wear again when I worked at Mac this was
a lipstick that we just could not keep
on the shelves it sold like crazy I put
it on everybody it's just beautiful so
Mac angel
that's the lipstick that Kim Kardashian
used to wear all the time and people
would come in to Mac and be like where's
the component to lipstick and then
moving on to the eyes I got you five of
my favorite makeup geek eyeshadows which
I am extremely excited about this
because so many of you guys are always
talking about makeup geek and ask me
about makeup geek so I'm really excited
to be giving away make a pink eye
shadows I got you guys the shades creme
brulee mocha Coco bear frappe and shimma
shimma honestly these five are yeah
pretty much my top 5 favorites when it
comes to the neutral eyeshadows and I
wanted to give away something neutral
because since this is a giveaway again I
don't know who I'm going to be getting
to and I wanted to make sure that their
colors that everyone can use and they're
gonna look beautiful on so with these
five you can do a daytime look a
nighttime look smokey look a really
dramatic look a natural look you can do
it all with these five shadows so I am
excited about the makeup geek shadows
for sure then you are going to be
getting a my two favorite pairs of the
lower lashes if you watch my channel you
know that I use these all the time like
I need to bust out and do something else
other than these two lashes because
they're all I wear
they are the whiskey sweet nothings and
then the strike a pose there are my two
favorite lashes pretty much ever in the
lash world is it that day UPS UPS man is
stopping me these are my absolute
favorite lashes ever they are on the
pricey side but the great thing about
them is you can literally wear each pair
of lashes 20 to 25 times so you really
get your money's worth out of them
they're just absolutely beautiful
I wear them over and over and over and
over honest to god I wear
all the time but at the same time you're
gonna spend that kind of money you're
gonna wanna wear them all the time so
these are my absolute two favorites
they're beautiful and I'm telling you
you guys will love them so strike a pose
and whiskey sweet nothings and then to
accompany the lashes of course I'm going
to give away my favorite lash glue I
talked about this in my monthly
favorites last month this is my absolute
favorite lash glue ever once you use
this you'll never want to use any other
lash glue again it's also still user
friendly but the fact that the wand
pulls out and you can just swipe it on
as opposed to squeezing a bottle it's
just great it is amazing and it's
inexpensive which I don't know why I'm
talking about being inexpensive because
you guys are putting these things not
buying them and I'm going to be giving
away two mascaras my absolute favorite
at the moment which is the Maybelline
volume Express pumped up colossal
mascara I talked about this when Wonder
talked about this in my last favorites
video I think this is my favorite
mascara ever right now it beats any high
mascara I've ever used I absolutely love
it it makes my lashes so long so
voluminous but not clumpy or just like
disgusting I absolutely love this I was
thinking I was going to get you guys a
high end mascara but then I was like but
this is my favorite right now my there
is no high in mascara at this moment
that I like better than this so I
figured that I would just stay true to
me and do my favorite one and then I
just wanted to get you guys one more
mascara because I know it's so popular I
haven't tried it yet but it's L'Oreal
miss manga manga not really sure how it
will pronounced in this situation but
miss manga mascara I know that this is
very popular and very talked about right
now so I thought I would just throw it
in there for fun and then last but not
least you will be getting the Bellamy 6
in one hair curler I have talked about
this a lot recently it is my absolute
favorite heroin I've ever used in my
entire life I've used maybe I would say
five different brands mainly new me but
I've tried some of my friends hair wands
before and for me for some reason
Bellamy this wand is the only one that
truly just holds my curl for days so
right here you can
inside it comes with six different
styles of wands a lot of the times I
will use in nineteen millimeters and
when I use a 19 millimeter wanna I kid
you not my curl lasts until I wash my
hair so three days probably my curl will
last all I do is just curl it hairspray
it and it kind of fluff it up maybe that
comb through it and that's it my pro
will literally last for three days and
it's never been like that with any other
hair one before this one so it is my
absolute favorite I don't know what it
is about it I just love it so yeah the
Bellamy 601 curler let me just clear
discussion so I can put it here so you
guys can actually see like what it all
looks like together hmm so now you can
