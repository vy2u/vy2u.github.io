finally go to this box I've been trying
so hard not like touch everything and
play with it it's not what she says so
if you've been here with me on my
channel for over like a year and a half
and you would recognize this background
as I am something at my house today
which I absolutely love it has taken
some time to get all of the equipment
over here because I currently I want two
three four five six lights staring at me
right now and my camera and on my tripod
and my monitor and the cord so it's a
lot but I really want to start filming
at home again I love it like it just
feels so natural just sitting here and
I'm talking to you guys I just feel like
I need to literally sit back and just
chill and there's no rush and like I
don't know like I'm just in my and then
my natural habitat this is my juicy room
so for today's video I'm going to be
doing a Sephora haul because we are all
nosy and we just love to see what one
another is buying I mean come on like I
love a haul more than anything I just
feel like it's something is definitely
dying out on YouTube and like breaks my
heart because they used to be so popular
like everybody would go out and like go
shopping just that they can haul it up
on YouTube they're like so exciting like
I love it hauls and favorites are like
just to videos I'm so like dedicated to
like I watch everyone favorite since
everyone's whole but I don't care who
you are I'll watch it I'm interested I
have so many products that I have
purchased in two weeks you guys it's
honestly shameful literally can we just
take a look at the sauce please like
this right here this is what a serious
addiction looks like so just take a good
look kids soak it up alright if there
isn't a such thing as like makeup
rehabilitation center like I should
probably invest in that and get it
poppin because I feel like I'm at that
point in my life now where I just need
help I asked you that on Twitter if you
would like to see a Sephora haul when
all my orders came in and it was my most
favorite tweet of all time which shows
you guys need makeup
just as much as me so don't even try to
come to me in a comment section because
we are all guilty oh my gosh I am
definitely feeling a little sassy today
because it is just that time of the
month and I'm outside by it flippin this
is my right as a woman so you can
success it or you can leave okay okay so
like should I put this right here
literally 20 through as I go or that so
like lame if you feel like oh my god oh
no I can't I really can't this is not
it's not aesthetically pleasing like no
one wants to see a big brown cardboard
box just sitting there hold on what am I
going to put this on okay so first thing
is first is the Smashbox step-by-step
contour stick trio this is just a repeat
item for me I just want to get it again
because I use mine all the way down it's
very very bottom there like little tiny
chose not to say that we're on YouTube
whatever I've been there literally just
like jumbo crayons and formula is so
beautiful and it's the highlight Braun
in the contour I often don't use the
bronze shade I only use the contour and
a highlight and I think the contour
color is so beautiful it's such a good
neutral without looking just dirty and
muddy on my face because so many times
Congress do human dog that's coming from
my dog not my asshole just so you know
thank you very much
so next I think this is the first time
ever for me this is a Clinique skin care
products which honest to god I don't
think I've ever used clinic skincare and
my entire life so this is the Moisture
Surge extended search relief gel cream
look that is the name and on the very
front it says hydration so I'm like yeah
and the reason I bought this is because
I was watching on rest nap chat somebody
to say I have such like there's
something so satisfying about watching
people do makeup on snapchat it's a
second anything it's like makeup related
on snapchat I'm just like so horny for
it with that too much it's out there now
so there's no going back
so more other stories I saw armor also
known as on reavie of social media
applying them on
snapchat and of course her foundation
just glided on perfectly I swear to God
like if she even real because I've met
her in person
and it's the same situation like in
personal space are you kidding
like she literally looks like a
mannequin just perfect
so of course you don't mean I'm like
yeah I by the clinic Moisture Surge the
nice kitchen was checked like her
I bought it milks makeup blur stick
singing that everybody has been talking
about recently because I am I'm a sucker
and a really really interested if this
actually work I've seen a lot of
positive reviews I honestly haven't seen
any major reviews I've seen somebody do
to people just saying like oh it's not
as amazing as I thought it would be but
it still just blur my skin and I see
other people who are like oh so it says
this is going to minimize the appearance
of pores and fine lines and create a
smooth matte finish - I'm not down for
the matte finish I did not do that
before I'm still going to try it anyways
and all that everything that I can to
make it glowy and dewy it says that you
can use it alone for an invisible
foundation or under your makeup as a
primer okay I'm Athena just has a ton of
silicone I'll go with the silicone free
okay I mean yeah on the back of my hand
I can definitely see like what it's
talking about like it definitely is
blurring and mattifying it out look I
can definitely that difference but let's
see how it actually will come a face
boom we'll find out later
I thought dick bangle tomforde
bronzing powder because it just looks
really really intriguing to me - so
accessible awesome packaging all right
hi sometimes I hate touching like really
expensive things the first time just
like oh what is this about
whoo it looked really pretty it's got a
little bit of some shimmer in it but
nothing like too intense like perfect
for the summer it's a little bit of like
really finely milled gold flecks of
shimmer I really like that color there's
a really beautiful neutral not to read
or to like oranjee terra cotta
excited honestly for the price I don't
help any browsing powder because it was
it just being honest but I'm a suck-up
I got sucked it then I got the Marc
Jacobs Omega bronzer which is Nietzsche
is very big like this and I actually
have owned this before in the past and
I've used it one time and I didn't like
it and I gave it away to a friend but
then Manny was telling me how much he
loved it so I'm like wait a second we
need to try to fit in he said is one of
his favorite bloggers so I'm like oh I
need to try that out one more time so a
budget I bought it because I'm like
maybe I just didn't get it the right
shot maybe with my foundation maybe my
power I don't know
the color is honestly really really
pretty like it's a really really nice
little bit red little bit orange so
basically a perfect neutral shade and
it's completely 100% map which I love so
I'm going to try this again to see if I
love it because it is really expensive
but you do definitely get a generous
amount of product that can be smooth at
the size of my head I went crazy with
foundations because of the fact that I
have been way more fair recently and I
haven't been getting spray cans in often
and just kind of embracing the more pale
skin if you will I do not have any
foundations that match me currently like
I only have my hourglass vanish sticks
those are honestly the only ones that
Makani are these right there that I have
in my top door this is where I sit and
do many every single day um so I needed
to stock up on foundations and get them
in my shade so I got a bunch of coverfx
foundations of course because you guys I
have to say cover effects I think if I
had to pick my two favorite brand from
Sephora of all time Isaac I can trust
every single product it's cover FX and
makeup forever like those two brands are
just so amazing and so substantial like
I swear like I've never let down by them
and even when I am it's not a big
letdown it's just like as amazing as I
wanted it to be you know one day I
didn't love them
so cover up I got the natural finish
oil-free foundation because this is one
of my favorite foundations and I got it
in two different colors or my pea laughs
so where's about the foundation is the
fact that it is full ad coverage and I
absolutely love the finish so much
because
natural with a glow like it's not super
dewy and it's not matte this is the most
beautiful like satiny finish it is
gorgeous
I love it for my dear foundations ever
so I got that into a new shade and then
I also picked up the cover FX total
coverage cream foundation
holy moly there is a huge shade range in
these like all different undertones
neutral warm cool and like a each
category there's like 10 or 15 shades I
was so impressed of course
like cover FX come through they're
always incredible so I got a couple
different shades in this one as well
I've never used this before but I'm
really excited to I also saw Rose using
this on her snapchat as well and I was
like I also got the giorgio armani
illuminant silk compact this is just the
on the powder foundation for the face
dub for the face shot when are you
joking me I need to open it up though
because you guys know that looks like
but I got in shade number two which is
their lightest shade and I'm shocked
I'll bet you I don't have anything
lighter like what your number one like I
needed number one I got another one of
the Josie Maran iris the argon oil
foundation because again is where my
hair foundation so I didn't have it in
my current state I only had it in like
my summer spray tan color so I got in
shade g15 cosmic so I have it tried to
see I don't know if it's going to be my
color but I'm usually pretty good shade
masking myself online but I love this
and I miss using it with my fair skin so
I got it in my shade I picked up cause
my voice sorry I'm having like major
allergy briefly and I've been changing a
lot coughing a lot like my voice is
coming and going severe it's just come
here for me I got three of the Anastasio
brow defiers in the shade chocolate
because I'm committed I actually have
two in my drawer in that drawer over
there right now as well so I now have 5
on backup because these aren't going
anywhere anytime soon and running out of
your brow pencil like in mid brow and
then not having a backup is literally
like for a makeup girl the end of your
life I saw the Rita Kazan I love
they write Rita has on New York these
are route concealer type of sprays if it
is for temporary gray coverage I got it
in the shade dark brown flash black and
light Browns I don't only know which
what I'm going to be because my hair is
really dark brown right now but this is
really exciting me because recently I
haven't done like in a lot of my
hairline I did it today but like I have
so much breakage especially over on the
right side of my head it looks like I'm
balding almost so I like take eyeshadow
fill it in which I don't know why didn't
do it today because normally my hair
lines up with shadow but I thought this
might be interesting to try because it's
like a spray let's see how it works so I
kind of have this like vision of me like
spraying it and like it's going all over
my face just destroying everything
so Whoopie I bought the way dry shampoo
foam and I actually didn't know that
like way was going to send it to me so I
got it in the mail
maybe like six days ago by I purchased
this beforehand and I actually loved it
so I'm going to keep this one as a
backup
it's crazy like I was so intrigued my
first row this all this week a dry
shampoo foam because it doesn't matter
if I'm running or dark hair like anytime
I spray dry shampoo there's always a
residue like even if I like you know
work it and you can still feel like
slightly lightens up the color of your
hair and it just drives me crazy I'm
like no I want like that richness to
stay like my color to stay true when I
use dry shampoo of course this is like
microscope problems I'm like I want to
have dirty hair but I went to look Bob
like really just one goes together you
can't have it all what I love about this
is it gives you so much volume and
sensitive foam it doesn't stain your
hair doesn't make it powdery and white
and need to tap on it so it's really
really good I used it pretty much every
day of the past days I'm going why I got
two brushes from coverup X because I was
just intrigued by them this one actually
reminds me my I think oh this one
actually reminds me of a similar shape
to one by morphe but I wanted to give it
a try because I don't really use brushes
from any other brand now other than
morphe and some Sigma brushes and I do
have some Max course I'm lying I do have
like I need some more cheese brushes so
if I'm the most part like I just use
morphine for everything because I just
really do love them but I figured I
would try to step outside the box and
try something new and see if there
really is a big difference because if
there's a few different I'll be honest
with you like my contour bronzer brush
like oh my god it cost so much money but
like I would spend three times the
amount of money because it's like no one
can actually replicate that brush it is
the best you know what I'm saying like
there's no morphe brush it is like that
town for brush like it just hasn't been
done they have brushes that are close
and comparable but never the exact same
we know I'll be honest about that so one
side this one for contouring what to
even call the cream foundation brush
which I would not use for cream
foundation but I will try it for contour
because I make my own rules
and I also got the cover FX powder brush
as well oh yes this seems nice mmm-hmm
so the next product I actually purchase
it from Nordstrom because before I
didn't have it and I got it because
Jeffrey star was raving about it I'm
pretty sure what's his favorite video
because I watched everybody's favorite
video like I'm addicted and you say that
this is like the best primer ever you
only have to tell me one does there's a
perfect primer out there I'm very easy
sell when it comes to primer who the
hell am I kidding I'm an easy sell when
it comes to all cosmetics clearly
anyways I got Norton comm saw the price
sainted John had to revive me from the
dead and I decided to purchase this 20
minutes later as I was thinking about
how oh this is literally like half of
what my rent used to be no big deal so
basically all I'm saying is that this
doesn't minimize my for smash my waist
get me pregnant and raise my kids I'm
not keeping it and honestly if I owned
that big it's one spoon ounce and
there's a little bitch is $200 I put
with one drop on back in my hand one I
was so scared and also every stomp it's
probably worth like $15 for god sakes so
I put like one little dot in the back of
my hand and I will say I will say that
the texture felt really really really
good like smooth but like sticky and
kind of like
geli at the same time which is what I
will be more when it comes to a primer
like I love that life's craziness
because it's really going to like
superglue like hold my makeup in place
and usually also gives me a nice kind of
dewy complexion so we shall see but I'm
going to be honest I think I'm going to
be even more angry if I do love this
because that means I'm going to be
committed to a primer that's $200 and
that's on accessible I don't know why I
bought this entire place I don't know
when your ball with you how oh okay you
gotta get a topic I need to go over to
my sister's house I have Bible study in
one hour I didn't think I could best
painter laugh I'm going to let you know
is still them out there because a about
these things in the box
I got a bite you a stick which is the
unused Busha lipstick I love that name I
always think of sex in the city and this
isn't a shave meringue which is such a
pretty it's just such a beautiful like
everyday kind of rosy nude so pretty I
love Kevin up lon like just have enough
on like pin I've to be honest though as
far as we cosmetic cosmetic line I'm
actually not stand of everything but I'm
always willing to try because some
products that he does have like when
they're good they're freaking grapes you
know so I'm always interested in it is
cool it's like a pump it comes up like
this like you press on it oh oh it's
really like smoothing out my skin your
eye will see it but it feels really good
and it's like really smoothing on my
skin okay
okay guy doesn't come through so I got a
couple of the Marc Jacobs linmark liquid
lip creams I got them into two lightest
shades because I wanted to try off with
the news first because this is how I
always am I like to try my news before I
try anything bold and vibrant in any
sort of lip color whatsoever so I got
the shade a fawn over me and it's yours
to try so let's watch yours to try it
first so this definitely had like an
orange e undertone and this next one is
fawn over me and this has more of a pink
undertone which this is the one that
would be way more flattering on my skin
right
now it looks like that so these are
called liquid lip cream I'm assuming
that they're not going to drive folding
back I'm assuming it they're going to
have some sort of creamy consistency to
them oh my gosh this is beautiful
looking okay so this is a Tarte
Amazonian clay 12-hour highlighter in a
shade sparkler highlight and it looks
like this like I know if you can see
that I'm scared to swatch it because I
really wanted to be freaking amazing
because I've never heard anyone talk
about this before and I just saw it
online I'm just obsessed Tyler's
obviously and they're highlighting
palates are so beautiful but there's
some shades are highlighting palette
that are a total missed so I really want
this to be Bob okay okay okay
feels a little gritty on my finger okay
the swatch is promising but Lou can you
see that I hope the camera is picking it
up so this is that I'm going to be a
highlighter on my skin because I am too
fair for this right now but in the
summer when I have a spray tan this will
definitely be a highlighter oh my gosh
this is really pretty
I got be a cosmetic by I under eye
illumination today full coverage
anti-aging waterproof concealer so I was
like oh my god those are like a lot of
planes the only I don't like is the
packaging and looks like just like a
little like squirt bottle but this is
ideal for working makeup artist like
back in the day when I was a working
freelance makeup artist I loved any sort
of concealer that came like this because
it's just so sanitary for clients
meeseeks consistency though oh my god
this stuff is thick whoa okay I'm not
kidding for trying this I'm scared that
it's going to be a really creepy mask
because of the fact that it is so sick
but we'll find out I got to the
bareMinerals buttercream lip glosses
because I had haranguing of Malfi but I
saw them on Sephora and I was like like
I definitely always down try a new lip
glosses
I love lip gloss so much for my coffee
I love anything for the lips and I got
two new shades beautiful
the first one is sugar okay
this formula seems promising well I
don't know as I go back and forth it got
a little shrieky but it's got like a
really nice shine to it oh my god this
color though oh this identity groovy oh
my gosh this color that is so gray put
this one right here because I want to
try that soon as I see document I got
the lightest shade in the makeup forever
liquid lip these are called the artist
liquid matte and I actually they sent me
I don't know if it's the whole
collection but they actually sent me
like several shades in PR which is so
nice of them any time they get forever
come see anything I would know by going
ah this formula you guys I already tried
one of them on it they sent me and wore
around my house like two or three hours
and the formula of these are amazing
like they're so thin but so opaque and
so comfortable like I am so excited to
explore the line and like actually place
all the colors but just just got them
this one is in the shade 101 which is
like a really really pretty like rosy
nude shade so I am so excited about this
also the new MacBook with the six you
guys are amazing like when they first
came out I hated them but I'll be honest
I didn't talk about them didn't like
them but I did not at all like I was
shocked by actually how bad they were
but now like they I guess they
reformulated then they had to us because
I just got a PR package last week with
like 10 new shades and they're amazing
like the formula is beautiful now I only
try the three nude shades they sent me
but all three of them the formula was
ball so I was really excited about these
new liquid lips they're so nice okay you
guys the thing I am hand down the most
excited for like so excited for because
I've been seeing everybody talk about
these the past couple of weeks and I
have to feel like salivating over them
and I actually played my first order for
three of these like a week and a half
ago and they came in and I felt so in
love that I bought the rest because I
would buy do I need them all they're so
beautiful so these are the Sela
magnificent metals glitter and glow
liquid eyeshadows such a long name I'm
going to collect all been for you me and
my friend Jackie were playing around
from the other night when we were just
like you know messing around we have any
makeup on we're putting them on our eyes
like seeing how they blend it out and
seeing how they worked with like other
creams and other shadows and so far I
just like how I was testing them like
they seem amazing so I'm so excited
about these because they are like
straight-up metallic you see them go hot
bother over here at like work oh my gosh
just looking at them I'm like Hello you
are so beautiful as they look like this
they're like small and compact which I
love and then where I think the
packaging is awesome
let me just watch the first one for you
this is in the shade smoky storm I'm
going to try to swatch it you can see it
on camera
Oh beautiful so you can see with one
swatch oh my good gorgeous and the
camera isn't even picking up how
actually glittery it in person is
ridiculously beautiful next one is key
in karma and I was so excited about this
one because I love their shade can so I
thought maybe it would be similar and
it's not really that similar but still
is beautiful it's like got like a very
champagne peachy undertone oh my gosh
you guys jeez they're telling me this
one is gold got it
so just like straight gold this one I
don't know why it's not applying the
same as the others it could just be mine
yeah the gold one isn't like blending
out on my hand as nicely as the others
you can see it right there it's
definitely more like a green yellow
based gold you know not like a warm goal
but more like a yellowy greenish gold
I think it's 90 my favorite is a
smoldering satin this is the one that I
was playing with the other night oh my
god that's the watch though like how
easily it just like bled right look at
this color not color payoff
oh my god this one is diamond dust which
is gorgeous
it's like a silver with little flecks of
like different shades in it as well not
like all the colors of rainbows is very
subtly and Sully very so yes gets the
other night and then last one is molten
midnight and this one is the black one
oh my god
so while I was in this feel affection
Anza for comment also picked up another
reluctant eyeshadow because it's such a
staple in any collection it's so
beautiful it can be used in eye shadow
or a highlight in my opinion it's just
such a pretty all over very frothy that
is the worst watch I've ever done in my
entire life let me just handle myself
except a pretty frosty
kind of just vanilla champagne glow just
so great for all over the lids no matter
if you're going to something selfie
earth and the natural it's just it's
gorgeous lasts are not least in the box
I bought five I don't know how many they
actually have I bought five I'll be new
makeup forever
star lips powders because I just I know
makeup forever and I know I'm gonna love
them so I wasn't going to start off with
one something I know if I thought with
one I'm going to want all of them and
they're going to be sold out because
people probably gonna find out they're
amazing these make it revered always
amazing so I got all five shades it's my
first time watching any of them yes
upset just instant love did you see that
that is what it's like to fall in love
first night in case you didn't believe
in love I've just demonstrated it
gorgeous okay I need to clear my hand
but I can get some swatches popping up
in this bitch my lips are getting kind
of crusty foreheads o'clock oh my god oh

saw any favorite applause this is that
bareMinerals groovy oh my god the way it
applied in the color does these make up

number 12

intense purple like oh my god I'm like

Matt Matt ish it's got a little bit of a
sheen to the purpley blue you guys I am
feeling so excited about all these new
products like I cannot wait to like get
everything out and organize it and start
like putting it on my dresser like
that's the best part the last measure
though is the box I got just make it
forever star lick liquid which is like a
liquid highlight oh my gosh it looks so
beautiful
online oh my phone is ringing and I
don't even care
sorry whoever you are I'm in it right
now but this is just a liquid highlight
which honestly I am NOT a huge and
liquid highlight because you have to put
liquid highlights like over just bare
foundation and I always have to set that
area with a powder so I'm not crazy
about liquid highlights
but it's makeup forever and I will try
anything make it forever I'm dedicated
