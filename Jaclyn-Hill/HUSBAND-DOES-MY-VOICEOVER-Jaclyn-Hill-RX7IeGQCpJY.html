Jaclyn's hubby damn that highlight is on
fleek mm anyway we're gonna dive right
into this flame makeup look Jack on the
 Owen I mean she is bringing the
heat in this one I mean you have to
admit please subscribe you haven't
already
haze mmm all right first things first
this is what we need to get this flames
look going you need some concealer is I
think that's what it is all right so
first thing you rub it on your cheeks so
are some chapstick on lips might get a
little chapped from this just a poor
warning then we get this spray this is
what actually keeps the makeup like
stuck on there so you just spray spray
and there you go mm second step is some
more concealer it's in a black bottle
this time go ahead and rub it on the
cheeks smear it in with that gold brush
go ahead and try and blend that in as
best as possible
smear it up okay now you got a square
with both cheeks left and right I know
it's more appealing people usually say
blend but I personally like to say smear
just got more of a ring to it just
little bit more feminine my opinion no
way so yeah go ahead and smear the top
forehead okay go ahead and smear the
stache basically with this stuff it's
pretty much the more the better so don't
be afraid to take it on there okay apply
it under the eyes heavily both eyes
right and left cover up any you know
dark circles chin the nose the forehead
then you get this pink ball sponge thing
I've seen Jacqueline use a lot like to
call to telly tubby ball so go ahead and
grab the telly tubby ball and dab it in
under the eyes she's gotten really fast
at that that's awesome good for her Wow
yeah she's gotten crazy fast okay so you
keep doing that kind of rub it in your
eyes there you go this right here I have
a lot of experience with I've actually
used I believe this is a contour marker
or pencil I've actually used it a lot
when I'm like
coming up with a tattoo idea I'll like
draw it on with that it's really hard to
get off you Jacqueline always laughs
when she sees me using it I'm weird so
go ahead and rub it in give it a nice
shadowy look then you draw five lines on
your forehead on each side and a line in
the middle then you schmear it in very
fast I'm not gonna lie the dogs have
interrupted me at least five times and I
just started so I don't know how she
does this they're making this card
anyway then you get a pencil preferably
something that matches your skin color
skin tone you make a joker looking scar
II smile from your lip to your ear
colored it and grab the telly tubby ball
bounty bounty telly tubby there you go
rub it smear it get under your earring
there you go
I'm not going it looks like it feels
really good I have to go grab that telly
tubby ball and rub my ear with it okay
grab a eyebrow liner and thicken and
darken those brows from what I've
learned from Jacqueline it is the
thicker the brows the better your 20/20
I guarantee people are going to have
straight unibrow and people can watch
like being like get a bow on stink and
you'll be like damn straight you know
brows have been grown for at least 10
years bitches okay now you're going to
grab the huge brush the bomb brush and
bat bat bat pop pop pop pop pop pop pop
pop on the forehead stop okay go ahead
right above the cheekbones the forehead
then you grab another big-ass brush and
you brush it up brush that hair out of
the way
brush your cheek instead of brushing
your teeth just brush your cheeks that's
all you need
did you brush your teeth sweetie now it
breasts my cheeks that works you can go
to school with bad breath and cheeks on
fleek thanks Danny also I'm not sure if
this microphone is picking up Jacqueline
and her friend out there but they are
going berserk
basically screaming row row row your
boat gently down the stream
okay back to the look so she's grabbed
another brush and she's rubbing up above
the eye actually on the eyelid in the
crease of the eye below the brow you
grab this other one and you basically
blend it up
actually no schmear it up smear the
other side smear Lord then you got to
pucker your eyes really wide and look up
to the sky and blend right in your eye
crack I think now would be a good time
if I try out my Peter Griffin voice for
all you guys and you could let me know
if it's legit or not I mean I personally
think it's pretty good but it may suck
so let's go for it
all right ding fries are done go ahead
and go and give me a beer
gee dad you're one smart fella and your
flats melamed perfect let's go home I
think that's all I'll give you for that
one okay
back to the look go ahead and speed it
up again up on the lid looks like she's
applying some kind of brown eyeshadow
actually that eye shadow this is pretty
exciting
that's actually the Jacqueline Hill
morphe palette so you saw it here first
giving you the sneak peek oh my god talk
about an epic sneak peak I mean John
Hill is just bringing you with the
exclusive alright continue with lightly
dabbling up above the below the brow
actually now we're going right below the
lid nice steep in that crack that's what
she said okay blend blend blend
now she's got some mascara she's putting
on her lashes very sexy boo very sexy
I actually i likey I likey okay now
she's got some tweezers she's thrown on
some big bushy lashes give it that
little extra flakiness talk about fleek
bloomed fleek fumes man it's hard to
talk I don't know how she does this all
right throw the second ones on there
she's super deep in that corner with a
highlight you could just drench yourself
with highlight at this point and people
just be like hey late on freaking fake
and you'll be like ah I took a
bath in this oh my god cold AF
skulls a ass per my goals I like golf as
you can see the look is coming together
and damn she looks good she looked good
for real oh all right now she is
blending the cheeks if I know anything
about the art of makeup it is literally
blend in to your fingers bleed for real
another very important lesson taught by
Jacqueline Jacqueline was actually the
person who taught me how to
when I was a teenager so she's helped me
a lot
without Jacqueline Eide crashing cars
with uneven unblended makeup okay now to
the liner of the lips go ahead and line
the outline of your lip make that lip
look nice and full
Jacqueline's got some bomb-ass lips and
this is crazy
another epic exclusive from John Hill
Jacqueline is using a nude color nude is
the best
speaking of nude I would like her to
give me some nudes for my wife why not
all sexter it's a brand-new lipstick
coming out with her new makeup line oh
my god
you heard it here first John Hill giving
you the exclusive the epic sneak peak
okay so you keep smearing that up on
your upper lip you gotta rub the cheeks
keep on oh my god wow that fart really
created a lot of fleek fumes whoo that's
a nice highlight there I'm excuse me
miss cackling how much highlighted you
can accuse go a shitload all right so
keep blending the highlight one thing
I've learned about her is every day is
the full face highlighter challenge I'm
Jack what's one more question
um harder mine and Frankie just farted
and it is it is pungent Wow
give me a second okay that almost gave
me another seizure all right now she is
rubbing her forehead spraying it with
these baby wipes
I think that's preventing it from
getting a hair ID it's pretty smart now
she's trying to get out of her eye okay
you could see it's all up in the air
bomb selfie time but all jokes aside
guys I rarely get a chance to talk to
her followers and my subscribers but I
just want you guys to know I am so proud
of my wife for how far she's come her
