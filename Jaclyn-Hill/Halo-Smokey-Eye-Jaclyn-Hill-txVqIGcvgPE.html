hey guys today's video is going to be a
makeup tutorial on this look right now
definitely this look right here it's
funny because I really had to step
outside of my comfort zone to create
this look I had to push myself because
this is not a look that would typically
do on myself not to mention this lip
color I've owned it for months and I
think it's such a pretty color to look
at but I'm like no thank you not for me
I forced myself to put it on and I'm
like okay now I don't want to take it
off and isn't that like how it works
they stay like begins at the end of your
comfort zone you know now without that
applied to make up until today so
today's makeup look is going to be
created with the Anastacio self-made
palette such a good palette you guys I
know there was a ton of hype about it
when it first came out and I'm kind of
late to jump on the bandwagon I just
feel like those shadows are getting
better and better I don't know what it
is but I feel like every palette that
comes out every shower that comes out
they definitely are getting creamier and
more blendable and more pigmented and I
just I really love them so this pink
champagne color is my most favorite
color in this palette I absolutely love
it that's what's on the center of my eye
right there this deep purple this hot
chocolate so good hot chocolate is such
a good dark brown it reminds me of fudge
which is one of their like permanent
single shadows so yeah I'm gonna stop
babbling today's look is actually kind
of a Nastasia look I didn't think about
that but I'm using her liquid lip and
her eye shadow so that was totally
accidental
but yeah I love you guys I hope you
enjoyed this video and if you want to
see how to get this look then just keep
watching hey guys so for today's look we
are going to be starting with the skin
and I am using the Smashbox primer water
I just love how moisturizing and
refreshing this primer water feels and
once it's completely dry we're going to
go in with the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
foundation stick and the way I'm going
to be applying this as I'm going to make
a stripe across my chin to stripes on my
cheeks and then I'm going to grab my
foundation brush and blend this out I
have been going back and forth and
having a total love-hate relationship
with this like artiste brush that legit
looks like a hairbrush or tooth brush
whichever um at first I hated it I was
like this is terrible who would ever use
this now it's growing on me and I've
been using it constantly it's the only
brush that I took with me when I went
out of town and it's really been growing
on me so I will go more in depth about
this brush soon but that is what I'm
using to apply my foundation it really
makes a little bit go such a long way
like it really just spreads it around
the face and into the face
as opposed to soaking up extra product
like most brushes will just naturally do
so now I'm going to be doing my
concealer and I'm going to use they make
a forever ultra HD concealer this is not
sponsored by make up forever don't get
it twisted honey I'm just a fan so I'm
going to be blending this out with a wet
Beauty Blender I like to make sure I get
my blender really wet and then wring it
out so that it's like very moisturizing
and it really soaks up a generous amount
of product so you don't get cake faced
easily now we have to set this concealer
like my good friend I told her how much
I love this concealer and she's like
good crease it was like crazy on me and
I'm like are you setting it no okay
that's why and then she said it and now
she's like oh my god I love it so you
really if you're not someone who sets
your under-eye you're probably not gonna
like this concealer because it does get
very Creasy but when you set it it
doesn't crease and it's so high coverage
and it stays hydrating which is what I
love about it so now I'm going to be
setting the whole face just lightly
tapping some of the Mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade medium all over
the face a tip about these powders is
they do oxidize a little bit so go on
shade lighter because an hour later they
will be darker than when you first
applied so going in with the anastasia
palette i am going to be using sherbet I
know some people pronounce it sherbert
some apply it sherbet
I say sherbet whatever tomato tomahto
right so using a long haired fluffy
blending brush I'm going to put that in
the entire crease area I start in the
lower crease and then I'm going to bring
it up a little bit I'm going to go all
the way from the outer corner to the
inner corner of the eye I really want
this to be nice and blown out and smoky
evenly from the inner to the outer of
the entire eye so it's going to wrap
that around constantly I'm putting in
fast for motion because honey you're
going to be blending for a minutes then
I'm going to grab hot chocolate which is
this really nice kind of cozy warm brown
shade and a smaller blending brush it's
basically the same shape but it's just a
little bit tighter I'm going to use that
to place that on the outer corner of my
eye and as you can see I'm trying to
keep it nice and low and put it directly
in that crease but I'm not going to
bring it above the crease when you're
going in with dark colors like this I
know initially can be kind of scary like
oh my gosh I'm going to put the super
dark color on my eye the trick is to
keep it nice and low and as you can see
as the product is wearing off my brush I
then begin to go back and forth and
windshield wiper motions and I take it a
little higher a little bit at a time and
then I go in with a clean brush and I go
over it to make sure we don't have any
harsh lines so again
just make sure that you stay low beneath
the crease of the eye and if you don't
have a crease in your eye you can create
one just stay nice and low and tight and
then go up a little bit higher a little
bit higher at a time and then blend it
out with a nice clean brush so that you
don't have any harsh lines it's just
like the easiest way to apply a dark
color without getting overboard and
looking like you've been beaten up you
know you can easily look like you've
been like in a fight and that's not a
good look so just keep it low and you'll
be good to go oh my god I rhyme stop so
I'm going to grab any pencil brush this
is like a super old grungy pencil brush
I've had for like five years but any
pencil brush will do it just shows that
you don't have to have like the most
expensive brushes to make things work
right so I'm just packing that same hot
chocolate color and the entire inner
corner of the eye making sure we're
covering all that ground we want it to
be just as dark as the outer corner and
now I'm going to grab buttery buttery is
like a really nice soft kind of vanilla
shade it doesn't have much spar it
doesn't have like any shimmer it's like
a nice kind of semi matte and just
taking a fluffy brush I'm going to put
that on the brow bone just to kind of
help blend out any harsh lines and use
that as a nice soft highlight now going
in with pink champagne which is
definitely the star of the show and this
eye look it's so beautiful and it's so
pigmented you can use a wet brush like
you can spray it with some fix+ or put
some eyedrops on your brush or you can
go in dry I am getting my brush is like
a tiny bit wet I lightly spray like a
little bit of mist a fix+ on it just so
that it has that really intense metallic
sheen and it goes on super easy and it
doesn't have fallout if you're working
with a shadow that has a ton of fallout
get your brush damp and then go in it'll
make it way more heavy duty and a
metallic and it will also make it so you
don't have fallout all over your face so
once we put this on the entire center of
the eye you want to cover like the whole
ground this is really going to give you
like that wide-eyed round-eyed doe-eyed
effect we are going to take a little bit
more of that hot chocolate and just go
over the edges so that it's not harsh
because you don't like an intense harsh
edge I will say I wish I took a little
bit more time to blend out my right eye
because you can see that line right
there it's a little too harsh for me but
that's okay
we can move on I should have gone back
in with the pencil brush one more time
to blend it out but I didn't so we can
move past that right right okay so now
for liner I'm using the Maybelline black
gel liner and just any small angle brush
and all I'm going to do is just lightly
line my lashline I'm not going to doing
liner today I'm not going to do a bold
intense liner because I don't want to
take away from the eye look and also if
we did a wing
would really create a Cateye and I want
this to be more of a round doe-eyed
effect instead so we're taking all the
steps to keep it a nice round eye to
look for lashes I'm going to be going in
with the Vegas nay lashes in Grand
glamour oh these lashes are so beautiful
and you can find them at the drugstore
they're available at Ulta they are so
grand there is the perfect name grand
glamour
they are so beautiful I will say they
were initially a little uncomfortable
but I got over it real quick like they
adjusted quickly and they were totally
fine
they are Vava voom they are so beautiful
they take any eye look and really bring
it to life as you can see so now for the
brows I'm just doing as normal filling
them in with the Anastasia brow Wiz but
you guys her new brow pencil I can't
even talk about it actually I will be
talking about it very soon I'm
absolutely in love but this was before I
discovered this was before okay I didn't
know any better okay so please forgive
me but I am using the brow Wiz in the
shade
chocolate and now speaking of chocolate
we're going to go back in with hot
chocolate we're going to line at the
lower lash line today I'm going to bring
that color all the way in to the very
very inner tear-duct of my eye I
normally don't do that in the lower lash
line I kind of fade it out and I let the
inner corner of my eye be nice and like
bright but today I'm going to bring it
all the way in that way it kind of meets
the upper lid color and is really a halo
smoky eye then I'm going to take
metallic plum and I was not meaning to
flip you guys off I'm so sorry you know
I love you and just taking that same any
pencil brush will do I'm going to just
blend out the entire lower lash line
with metallic plum even though I send
the metallic plum it's not like a super
metallic it's got a sheen in it but it's
not frosty so that's what I use to blend
that out then I'm going to take a nice
creamy white eyeliner and put it on my
lower lash line to again make the eyes
look more open and round and doe-eyed
because that is what we're really going
for with this halo smoky eye today you
can of course do a cat eye you can do
black in the inner rim it's going to
look gorgeous but I really wanted to
create a look for those of you who want
your eyes look very open and awake and
alive then I'm going to be using just a
little dab of Mac nylon on the really
inner corner almost like on the bridge
of the nose just so that we can bring
even more attention to this look then
for lower lashes I am using the Mac
extended play mascara it's my favorite
lower lash mascara of all time and then
contouring I'm going to be using Mac
shade stir now this exact one that I'm
holding in the compact came out in a
limited edition collection but shades
star is still available in their Pro
line so you can get on mac cosmetics
comm and in their pro stores and
basically it's just a little it's like a
magnetic one that you just pop into like
a Z palette and it's the exact same
product so anyways I am just softly
contouring my face sculpting on my
cheekbones bronzing the forehead you
know how we do making sure there's no
harsh lines and then we are going to
create a very harsh line using the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and a really
sharp brush and I'm going to just sculpt
this out cover the entire lower half of
the face and I will immediately go in
and blend out like literally let it sit
for 30 seconds and then I just blend out
so that it's still soft and it just
makes everything look nice and
airbrushed and that contour will not
move for days honey then for blush I'm
using Mac warm sole such a classic blush
this you see my favorite blush by Mac
when I worked there one of my favorites
I can't commit to just one but it's just
a beautiful color it took a nice peachy
warm bronzy shade with a little bit of
shimmer just looks so natural it's a
great blush that works for every look
pretty much then I'm going to be using
the Anastasia glow kit and I'm using the
shade bubbly and I'm going to just be
lightly highlighting the tops of the
cheekbones these kits are super cool the
fact that they have four different
shades and they came out with two kits I
think it's really awesome it's a great
idea you know I'm obsessed with
highlighting so I love these kits and
then for lips I am using Anastasia sepia
liquid lipstick this is a color that I
would never think to put on myself but I
was like you know what let's have some
fun it goes with the eye look it gives
me like a kind of dark and edgy vibe
which i think is really cool so I
encourage you to step outside of your
comfort zone too because you never know
what you'll end up liking because I love
this now so to just set everything I'm
going to use makeup forever a mist and
fix setting spray and we are good to go
so I hope it's you enjoy this look you
guys make sure you send me pictures if
you recreate it I love you and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
