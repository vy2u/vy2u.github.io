sit here and just try to power through
the storm that is happening outside I
don't even know why Florida's referred
to as the Sunshine State because I feel
like it rains 90% of the time like
everyone comes here to vacation thinking
they're gonna like lay on the beach with
the beautiful weather and the sunshine
go to California that's what you want
because in Florida you'll probably end
up sitting in a hotel room for the
entire week while it's just torrential
downpour do you hear this alright it's
much more quiet now thank God because it
was getting really really crazy out
there
so for today's video I am of course
going to be doing a step-by-step makeup
tutorial on this look that you see but I
Tia I was so totally inspired by this
photo the a subscriber tweeted to me
weeks and weeks ago and look at this
girl's makeup
let me zoom into her first of all her
bone structure on point just got
something out there but this makeup I
died for it so I was totally inspired by
this I did make it much more dramatic
and a little bit extra but you know me
and I should probably do around heal and
it looks like it is by crystal clear
makeup as you can see right there I know
that looks like this can be somewhat
intimidating especially because you have
a glitter liner so it's like oh right
not only do I have to do a regular
winged liner but I also to do a glitter
liner like it seems like a lot of work
it seems like something that you could
easily mess up on and I get that but
don't be afraid to try you never know
what you're gonna be good at until you
try it and maybe you'll put it on and
you'll hate it but maybe you'll
absolutely love it so don't be afraid to
try new things you know so I always say
the beauty about makeup is if you don't
like it hey at least you tried it out
and you can wash your face and it's done
it never happened
so anyways thank you so much for
watching this video you guys if you
liked it make sure to subscribe to my
channel if you want to see more give it
a thumbs up you know I appreciate it I
love you guys so much and I'll see you
soon bye hello everybody so for today's
a look I'm gonna start with my eyes
because things can tend to get messy
when you work with a lot of shadow
especially dark shadows so I want to
make sure I can clean it up and not ruin
my foundation that's why I start with my
eyes first I'm going in with makeup geek
bake sale and a small natural hair
blending brush this is the morphe m44
one and as you can see I'm taking this
color all the way to the inner corner of
my eye and winchell wiper motions all
the way to the outer corner
then I'm going to grab some good old
makeup geek creme brulée it's been a
minute since I've touched this eyeshadow
using that exact same brush I'm going to
blend that right over top of it I'm
going to take this a little bit higher
up towards the brow just so that it's
nice and smooth and nothing is harsh now
I'm going to be grabbing the masquerade
palette by Julia's place I was really
looking forward to playing with this
because hello look at all these
beautiful colors so I'm going to pick up
this kind of medium to dark matte brown
shade it's super pretty I will say right
off the bat you guys there definitely is
some inconsistency in this palette
because some shadows are bomb and then
others definitely lack blend ability and
pigmentation this color though it's
beautiful so I'm going to be packing on
the outer corner and bringing it all the
way to the inner corner just like I did
with the other two shades just this time
I'm packing on a little bit more of a
generous amount and I'm going to keep it
lower on my actual lid and I don't
really want to go any higher than the
crease of my eye make sure you're evenly
packing at the same amount of products
on the inner corner as you are the outer
then I'm going to grab another Julia's
place palette this is the Nubian too I'm
going to grab that cool tone brown and
now you're going to see I'm definitely
having difficulty with this I was hoping
that it would show up really cool and
really intense and deep and as you can
see I really wasn't getting much product
put on my eye
I was trying though I was going to make
it work
it works if you work it right so I kept
going back and packing more and more on
but what I ended up doing was I actually
ended up grabbing some Anastacio Beverly
Hills fudge I shadow which is kind of a
warmer brown but it's very deep which is
this one right here that you see on the
screen I'm gonna go over everything
because it just looked a little patchy
it wasn't blending right and I honestly
sat there with that color for like five
minutes trying to make it work and I was
like girl I am done battling these harsh
lines okay let me go ahead and grab
another shadow and blend it out so that
is what I did I'm literally just taking
a smaller more dense blending brush that
I used in the beginning and I'm going
over everything and back and forth and
windshield wiper motions and then I will
take a clean brush I just kind of go
over the whole thing very gently as you
can see to make sure that dark brown is
blended in with that lighter brown now
I'm going to go in with the Natasha de
Nonna palette and I'm going to use the
shade 0 for M chromatic you can buy
these palettes or you can buy them
individually
cool I'm going to spritz my brush with a
little bit of mac fix+ and then very
very lightly and slowly I'm going to
begin to pack this color on just the
center of my lid now you're going to see
me struggle in this video but I actually
kind of liked it I thought I'm not going
to edit out the struggle because I want
you guys to see certain things that
you'll come across when doing makeup and
not to get frustrated and ways to work
out of it so I packed that color on my
lid and then I went back with a Nastasia
fudge and all of a sudden I'm like as
I'm packing this on I'm like it is just
it's not giving it to me the way I want
it i sat here for so long trying to
blend out that silver and make it look
really beautiful I ended up kind of
covering it up as you can see me doing
right here because I'm like why aren't
the edges blending out so I ended up
taking that exact color with the exact
brush and mac fix+ and putting that
silver all over my entire lid and I did
my left eye with this different
technique and it was so much better like
just covering my entire lid with this
and then going in and putting that dark
brown on the inner and outer corner it
was so much easier it was so fast it
took like 60 seconds and the outcome was
better for some reason this has never
happened to me before normally like I do
this halo technique and it's easy but
for some reason today my shadow was
trying me and it happened it's like
somedays wing liner is super easy the
other day it's so crooked it's like you
just want to wash her face and scream
and throw something across the room and
today was one of those days my shadows
did not want to blend so that's a little
tip that I kind of learned along the way
and it helps so much so now moving on to
liner I'm gonna give myself a nice wing
you can do as thick and as long as you
want to go oh honey if that's not what
she said I don't even know what she said
but one thing that I love about this
look doing the glitter liner is if you
struggle with having a straight line
it's actually kind of awesome because if
your line is wavy it's okay because you
can go in and cover up a glitter liner
so now I'm going to go in one of my
favorite glitters ever this is by lick
cosmetics and I'm going to use the lit
glitter glue which you need if you are
someone who works with glitter a lot I
can't stress enough how amazing this
glitter glue is it truly is the best and
ask for the liner
I literally just dip my brush into it
pick up a little bit of the glitter and
it just makes it so slippery and it just
glides on so easy and it's nice and full
pigment glitter and as you can see right
here this is honestly easier than the
black
gel liner itself it is so simple but I
will say the reason why is because the
brush you have to have the perfect brush
that's not too fat not too thin and
comfortable in your hand this is the
morphe m25 0-1 and it's my favorite one
if you need to touch up your liner a
little bit if glitter has fallen down
you can totally go back and make it
blacker and touch it up so everything is
nice and straight and symmetrical now
I'm going to be applying false lashes
and I'm going to be going in with the
blinking Butte Samantha lash oh my god
my babies I swear if I could birth a
lash it would be these like they are
going to be I think in my top three for
like the rest of history they're just
beautiful I'm going to be priming my
skin with LC pearl irradiance primer it
is amazing for those of you who have dry
skin are looking for a radiance moisture
hydration it's such a nice primer then
Pro Foundation I'm going to be using the
hourglass vanish stick foundation this
is a medium to full coverage definitely
more on the full coverage side I
absolutely love it as you can see I
literally look draw on my skin I paint
it on and then I buff it out with the
morphe m43 9 buffer brush which is a
synthetic brush I always recommend a
synthetic brush to blend out your
foundation no matter what brand is buy I
think it gives the most beautiful finish
overall then for concealer I'm going to
be going in with the Tarte shape tape
don't worry I'm not using a shade of
that light I'm oh honey maybe a year ago
but not Nomo I do go over it with a
different darker shade because they're
currently out of stock of my actual
shade so I mix like a really really
light one and like a more tan one to get
my perfect color right and now until it
comes back in stock I'm waiting I'm
stocking you all too I am ready for my
shade I'm going to blend that completely
out with a damp Beauty sponge do you see
how full coverage that concealer is like
it doesn't play games
it does not play games so now at that
exact same damp sponge I'm going to grab
the RCM a no color transfer scent powder
I put it into like an old Sephora
packaging because I cannot stand the
packaging that it comes in and it just
makes it so much easier so I emptied out
an old container and just put it right
in there I'm going to set my entire face
with this damp sponge and that powder
including my under-eye I've been doing
this recently and I just love the
outcome it makes my whole face
bulletproof
I just think that it looks so flawless
I'm going to fill my brows really quick
and then we're going to jump to the
under-eye area I'm going to go with the
exact same shadows that I use on my top
lid and we're going to begin to just run
everything all the way from inner corner
to outer corner I do suggest when you're
doing a smoky eye don't bring your color
all the way into the inner tear-duct
otherwise it can begin to like a black
eye so make sure that you kind of stop
right when the lashes stop that's where
your color should stop on the inner
corner of the eye so after I apply it
with a pencil brush I'll go on the
blending brush with a little bit more
that color just to really blend out kind
of buff it down so it's nice and smoky
with no harsh lines how many times a day
do I say no sure harsh lines
honestly like I need to get like a
quarter jar where I put a quarter in
every single time I say no harsh lines
so I just use a little bit of gel liner
on my lower waterline and I'm gonna go
back in with that dark brown and just
blend that out so it's nice and smooth
and black with no harsh lines touching
another corner just applying a little
bit of mascara on my lower lashes of
course and then I'm going to move on to
the face I'm going to contour using
benefit hoola bronzer and I'm using this
brush that I have been love being
recently for contour I feel like I'm
finally getting my contour game back on
point I kind of lost it there for a
minute it's okay
it's okay cuz Mama's back I'm using the
m5 3-0 brush to apply this and it's kind
of scratchy which turned me off at first
because I was like this is not gonna
apply it very well and I kind of was
like a little pooter about it like I
don't like this now I'm obsessed now
I've used a couple of times I love it I
live for it I die for it and then I'm
going to sculpt out that contour by
going in with that same damp sponge and
that same exact transition powder I'm
just going to sculpt it out and then
immediately just grab a brush and wipe
it away you can leave it there if you
want for a few minutes or all day
whatever you choose no judgement but
especially use a damp sponge it's like
an instant effect and I just wipe it
right off and we're good to go
and then I'm going to grab the morphe
9-n blush palette I'm going to take this
matte kind of rosy topi shade and I'm
going to use that exact same brush I use
to apply my contour so I have two of
them I use one for blush one for contour
and I'm going to use that same brush I'm
going to put this on the apple of my
cheeks and blend up towards the temple
area now for highlight my favorite combo
recently champagne pop I heard
some lame girl she created it I don't
want to talk about her right now and I'm
going to mix it with mary lou manizer by
the balm I mean come on look at that
I'm sorry there's no denying there is no
denying that highlight it is so pretty
so I'm going to put that at the top of
my cheekbones I'm going to put a little
bit on my chin a little bit my Cupid's
bow and then the tip of my nose it's
kind of how I've been highlighting
recently and I really really like it
kind of brings an overall highlighted
effect to the entire face now for lips
I'm going to start off by going in with
color pop and Kathleen lights point zero
liquid lipstick I love this color so
much I talked about my favorites video I
talked about a lot of products in this
video my favorites but I just love this
lip color so much I think it's really
different and really really beautiful
but I wanted something a little bit
different for this look like I felt like
it wasn't popping enough so I grabbed
jeffree star cosmetics posh spice and
layered it and then I thought it was
perfect because it kind of has like a
grayish undertone to it so it really
pulled like the cool tone and the silver
is all together and I feel like it
really completed the look I've been
mixing liquid lip colors recently and
loving it like custom creating your own
anyways you guys that's it for this look
I hope you love it thank you so much for
watching I'll see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
