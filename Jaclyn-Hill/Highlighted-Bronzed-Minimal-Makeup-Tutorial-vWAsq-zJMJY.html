been since I filmed who does that mean
oh not believed and you know it's
serious when you clap - every syllable
I have not filmed a video in weeks
I think it's been three weeks instead of
actually sat down and filmed a video
which is basically a record the last
couple videos that you saw were
pre-recorded before I left to LA and got
my lips done I have talked a lot about
lip filler on my snapchat if you don't
follow me there I did get them done um I
don't know how I feel about it right now
they're a little crooked like this side
comes down a little bit more than this
side I don't know there's like bumps in
them but they're temporary they say that
my lips will be back to completely
normal within about two months from now
so I don't know how I feel about them
honestly I wanted them done forever so I
was SuperDuper excited and it's not
exactly what I wanted like I just wanted
like a little bit of plump like like
right in the center I don't know I don't
know I don't know can we talk about
these sunglasses for one quick second
these are the sunglasses that desi
Perkins teamed up with key to create wow
these are like my new obsession do you
see my mess when you look around so you
can see my mess look at my - hold on
uh-oh Oh yep look at all that look at
that I know and that's actually clean -
that the sad part these sunglasses have
been going everywhere with me I like
these more than any designer sunglasses
that I have at the moment these are my
current favorite go-to sunglasses I love
the color I've seen they're like the
dopest sunglasses right now
congratulations - desi these are badass
so if I haven't mentioned so already
today's video is going to be my kind of
like go to look that been wearing
recently very bronzy like minimal makeup
perfect for the summer it's all about
the skin and the lashes we're gonna let
the skin breathe today we're gonna let
it peek through I think there is nothing
prettier in the summertime when you let
go to the beach or the pool you get like
that little bit of sunkissed glow you
have on some lashes and like clear
glossy glossy lips and fresh skin and
lashes I just think it's so
so feminine so I'm gonna start off with
the naked skin weightless concealer by
Urban Decay one of my absolute favorites
I just got some new concealers sent in
the mail I'm super excited to try but
I'm gonna do a first impressions video
later so I'm holding off to try those
this is in the shade medium light
neutral I do not want to do a shade
that's much lighter than my skin I don't
want like a really highlighted under-eye
because I want the skin to look much
more natural today and something else
I'm gonna do different is I'm not going
to conceal my upper lid I'm only gonna
conceal the under-eye I want to leave my
lid completely blank and the reason why
is because it'll look more natural it'll
look like you're not wearing makeup as
much I'm just blending this out with a
damp Beauty sponge I love using a Beauty
Blender or any sort of damp sponge for
this because I just think that it makes
concealer concealer look so natural okay
I'm gonna take a lighter concealer now
and this is just the same shade light
warm so it's a warmer shade in a lighter
tone I'm going to put a stripe here and
write down my nose I'm gonna put one
there and then I'm going to go back to
the original color which is medium light
neutral and I'm going to just put it
there there there and I always like to
conceal my top lip because I feel like I
have discoloration there sometimes I
feel like it can look a little bit like
I have a mustache um even though it's
not hair it's just like discoloration on
my skin which is a really common thing
so if you feel like you have a mustache
from discoloration don't feel like
you're a freak it happens to a lot of us
and as you see I am bouncing up and down
my Beauty Blender you really don't of
course you can do it every you want it's
makeup if someone tries to tell you that
there's rules don't listen to them do
what you want but why is that creasing
there no no no bitch no bitch I would
suggest not to wipe when you're using
like a damp sponge or Beauty Blender
bouncing up and down will press it into
the skin make it look much more natural
you won't get streak marks and if you
wipe it cann kind of steal the products
off your face
so bouncing up and down will help
everything look more natural okay so
next I'm gonna go in with a product that
is my absolute summer can't live without
staple you guys know that I've been
using
it's for three summers straight like I
absolutely love it and it is the sole a
tenday chanel yes it is expensive and
it's by Sheneneh but you guys seriously
it is like one of the prettiest cream
bronzers that I've ever used just so
blendable I love the color alright so I
was going to grab any synthetic brush
whatever you're comfortable with it
doesn't matter sometimes I use this one
this is technically like the foundation
brush that I used by morphe this is the
m49 this one right here is the morphe 44
anything you can use an angled one there
used to be one by sigma that i loved i
feel like it was called like the e36
listen no f 36f 60-63 any synthetic
brush will do I just do not recommend
using a natural hair bristle you're
gonna want to use something synthetic
it's something kind of bouncy and puffy
so that you can apply the cream bronzer
evenly and make it look kind of natural
kind of natural I'm going to take the
m-43 9 and I'm going to just swirl it
around in my bronzer like this and I'm
gonna start blending it on to my face
why do I have like a line a son tanner
I'm just gonna start blending it right
here on the cheek bone area I'm gonna
bring this in more so than I would with
a normal browser when I'm doing like a
typical makeup look I wouldn't want to
bronze like this area really but today
I'm gonna kind of bronze the entire
cheek area so it kind of looks like a
sun-kissed glow as opposed to a contour
I'm gonna start right here and whenever
I apply cream bronzers I like to work in
circular motions at first but then I do
kind of like to do this motion that you
see me doing right now where it's like
I'm kind of patting and dragging at the
same time because if you keep doing
circular motions I feel like you never
actually get the product to sit where
you want it to sit but I actually like
doing this motion when I apply it
because it actually puts it where I want
it to be we're gonna go up on the
hairline right in here a lot of people
are always asking about my baby hairs
yes honey mama chopped them off one
night when she had a half a bottle of
wine I don't know what I was thinking
but I thought it was such a good idea I
was like oh my god
I'm gonna shave my baby hair it's like
oh I have never done this before I woke
up the next morning and I was like
that just going to put this all around
the entire hairline by the temples I'm
going to connect it down here I
typically would not bronze this entire
area but to for today's look again we
want to have an all-over sunkissed look
I love the feeling of putting on cream
bronzer I don't know why it's like so
satisfying just to watch your skin get
like dewy amber on tea at the same time
like yes god I'm now going to move on to
my brows and I want my brows to look on
more of the natural side today to
complement the overall makeup look I
don't want when you look at me to be
like oh my god we're out I want them to
look too masculine or too bold so I'm
going to be filling them in with the
Anasazi eyebrow definer and what I do is
I cone them upward and I start just in
the center of my brow I do not touch the
inner part of my brow because then it
can get a little too harsh so using very
small flicking motions almost mimicking
hair then at the top I'm going to brush
the hairs downward I'm going to fill
this area in so that we can get a
defined arch come out here on the tail I
don't want myth until 2:00 sharp
otherwise it'll look too fake and then
with the spoolie I'm gonna go over all
of it so that nothing is harsh okay
brows done alright so now we get to move
on to the fun part I talked about these
on snapchat the other day and so many
people were tweeting me about them
because oh do you guys I've never seen
anything like these before my life
they're so freaking cool and these are
the new cover FX custom enhancer drops
aka the most beaming metallized
highlights you've ever seen in your life
this is the say shade celestial and then
this is the shade sunlight so celestial
is like literally like liquid liquid let
me show you this liquid metal look at
that just one swipe you kidding me and
then sunlight is exactly how it sounds
it's such like a pretty thick of
champagne II bronze gold so really want
to mix them in with my foundation and
see how they look I'm sure I'll look
like straight-up Tin Man and I will be
completely fine with that um but for
today we are going to put them on our
cheekbone so I'm going to mix equal
parts of both of them
I have that right there on the back of
my hand like a little liquid metallized
cocktail if you will I'm going to go
ahead and grab a damp sponge and apply
this to my cheekbones you can use
whatever you want you can use a
synthetic brush a small brush and do it
with that but I'm just comfortable with
a damp sponge when applying liquid
highlights I just think that it looks
really pretty so I'm gonna start with a
little bit because you can always build
you don't want to go in with too much
right away I'm going to just start on
the top of my cheekbone and make sure
that you do this before you put any
powder on your face so if you wanted to
set your bronzer or set your under-eye
you're going to want to do this step
first before you go in with any sort of
powder
oh bitch oh yes honey yes yes yes I'm
kind of ongoing not all the way under
the eye but I'm kind of going under the
eye because I want this to be like an
all-over kind of like beachy summery
dewy highlight if you know what I mean
so I'm not targeting it just the top of
the cheekbone it's okay if it kind of
goes in this area I'm also going to take
a little bit of that and put it on my
chin if your oily you probably wouldn't
want to do this if you get an oily chin
but since I'm dry and my chin never
produces oil I'm going to put some there
because I want an overall glow to my
entire face okay so now I'm going to set
my under eye area where we put concealer
the reason why I do this is because I
personally think that it helps my
concealer look better and more
airbrushed underneath the eye area I
also think that it helps my pores look
smaller when I set my under eye area and
it also prevents it from creasing
throughout the day especially like a
really hot summer day which is what I've
been wearing this look for our hot
summer days so my favorite thing to use
is the RC I'm a no color transfer sent
out err and he tries to loosen powder
that you have will totally work for this
method that I'm about to do okay
someone's going to take the tip of my
damp Beauty sponge yes you want it to
still be damp because this method just
makes the under eyes look so pretty I
think in my opinion I'm going to take
that and directly start pressing it in
to the under eye area make sure that you
only do this when you are completely
done with all of your liquid products if
you want to apply any more liquid
products to the skin then you would want
to hold off on this this needs to be
your last step I apply it down the side
of my nose and kind of like right here
in the center because
this is where like my largest pores are
this is where most people's artist pores
are right there so I'm going to just
kind of apply it right there towards the
center of the cheek and then I'm going
to put it on the under eye area and just
tappy tappy tappy so now I'm going to
grab a little bit of Prosecco pop from
my face palette right here just because
I think that this look looks really
really pretty with a little bit of gold
and a highlight on top you can totally
leave it like this and walk away and
you're good to go but if you put a
highlight over top of these enhancer
drops you aren't going to blow this is
the morphe m3 ten gosh I'm using a lot
of morphe brushes recently and I'm going
to begin to dust this right over top of
that highlight just a little bit I'm not
going to put a ton on I just want to
bring a little bit of that golden glow
not to mention any time to set a cream
with a powder it's gonna make it last
longer so by setting a liquid highlight
or a cream highlight with a powder
highlight not always it going to give
you more but intense glow but it's also
going to make it less and stay beaming
throughout the day okay so now we are
going to move on trying to readjust
myself to lashes you do not have to wear
lashes you can go just like this and
it's gonna look really summery and glowy
but I want to put on lashes just because
this is the way that I've been wearing
it recently and these are my go-to like
favourite lashes when it comes to like
something that I want to stand out for
the same time still look wispy and
flirty and fluffy these are the velour
lashes in the style what is this fluff
and edgy these are sold at Sephora these
are a part of their silk line they're
100% real silk and they're just some
burnt thing okay I'm going to use the
house of lashes original lash glue this
is the clear ones in my favorite lash
glue ever it is like gorilla glue for
your lashes I'm just gonna put a little
strip right on the lash band you not
have to use a lot a little bit will do
the job it does not need to be clumpy or
anything I'm going to put on some
mascara just a thin coat of mascara on
my lashes all right so now for lashes I
applied one of them obviously but I'm
going to walk you through how I do this
I and the first thing that I always do
is I look down into my mirror that's
like the most important thing that I can
tell you is don't have your mirror eye
level but have it below you and angled
upwards we're going to come down from
the top using our fingers and I always
focus on the outer edge I don't really
care
if the inner corner or the middle of the
lashes get contact with the skin all I
worry about is right there on the outer
edge see how that has contact right here
I press that up against the lashes and
now I'm going to grab tweezers do not
grab tweezers use a lash tool or you or
use your fingers I only use tweezers
because with these stupid nails I can't
really get in there and do it but for
the first several years I was applying
lashes I was only using my fingertips
but now I'm comfortable enough that I
have this and if I damage my eye that's
on me because I'm a stupid ass but use
use the lash applicator or use your
fingers okay don't use tweezers so I'm
going to just go ahead and get this
really close to the lash line right
there okay I'm still looking down at
myself in the mirror and now I'm going
to get the middle and the very front of
the lash and get that nice and tight on
there now I'm going to go ahead and coat
my bottom lashes with mascara you do not
have to you can totally just do top
lashes I think it looks very fresh and
feminine but I'm gonna do bottom lashes
because it just really opens up my eyes
and I have long bottom lashes and I said
they look kind of weird sometimes when I
dump a mascara on them I'm using the Mac
extended play mascara it's one of my
favorites for the lower lashes along
with a Kevin Kwan mascara just because
the wands are so tiny I feel like I can
get every single eyelash and I can
really get them to cooperate with me the
way I want them to so now for lips I
want to just do like a normal nude lip
I'll be honest though I think that nude
lips look very very very weird now that
I have lip filler um I just think it
makes them look really bumpy and just
strange but I'll do it anyway so you
guys can see it and have a good laugh
for yourselves gonna use the lipstick
she and this is buy a house of dolls and
love love this color it's such a girl
get ready get ready
you're gonna look at my lips if you like
it I don't know like there's just
something about the nude that just looks
weird you can see this big bump right
here this still isn't going away I'm
dancing a little bit of Marc Jacobs
French tickler which is just like a
really pretty kind of peachy has a
little bit of glitter in it but not like
chunky glitter like a really pretty soft
shimmer what am I trying to top all
doing this
so then just to complete this overall
look in the summertime especially if I'm
wearing any sort of top that like shows
my shoulders my template on anything
like that I always like to kind of touch
base on those areas as well so I'm going
to be going in with this Tom Ford Soleil
belong shimmering body oil everybody has
been telling me how beautiful it is
people have been tweeting me about it
I've seen tons of people Instagram it
and post on snapchat my friends its told
me how much they love it so it smells
incredible
it's like a perfume scent that has a
shimmering body oil it's very like very
mature kind of like a I like to use word
musky because for some reason musky
makes me think of mothballs on a wire
it's like a musky kind of mature sexy
date night scent um yeah it smells
really good though so you can use any
body oil or bronzey oil for this
literally for one tenth of the price you
do not need this girl but I'm gonna use
it since I have it so I'm gonna spray it
like on my god smells so good I'm just
gonna blend it in with a brush just
because I don't want to get my hands
covered in glitter that's the only
reason why but you can choose your hands
but I don't want to have to go wash my
hands off as I'm filming so I'm just
using this instead it's just gonna give
you like a really really beautiful
sunkissed glow and what I love about
this is the way it looks when you are
outside cuz you look just so like
hydrated and dewy like stop it right now
do you not die for that look I'm feeling
a little extra just gonna go for it okay
last but not least I'm gonna take a
little bit more Prosecco pump and on any
brush it doesn't matter and I'm just
gonna load that up and I'm going to hit
the high points so I'm gonna put some
yes-yes-yes-yes trying to make sure that
my shoulders in a viewfinder so that we
can all catch this glow yes oh lord
thank you for Prosecco I'm gonna
awkwardly do this with the same hello
thank is the persistence how many my
shelter here can you imagine having like
a shoulder highlighter on staff goals
literally you guys I don't think you
understand how dysfunctional I am with
my left hand look at this this is like
pathetic
and while I'm at it I'm going to take a
little bit and put it right there on my
collar bones alright you guys so that
completes this video I really hope that
you enjoy as you saw this look is so
extremely easy I cannot stress to you
enough how easy it is this has been my
go-to for the past like 10 days or so
and it's gonna be my go-to for the
entire summer I just love it it's
literally like a ten to fifteen minute
makeup look and if you're applying
lashes and you feel like you're not good
at it yet just keep in mind that
practice makes perfect I get it like
lashes are so hot right now but don't
feel like you need lashes in order to
like be trendy in order to get the look
you don't you only need to put mascara
on for this look if you don't want to
just let it be about your skin and your
glossy lips if you want to just do
mascara curl your lashes that's fine too
just embrace it but if you want to do
the extra step and apply lashes don't
get frustrated if you don't get it the
first time when I ever start applying
lashes it was all mess oh god it took me
so long to finally get it down and even
once I got it down I still felt like oh
this one's poking me in the eye oh this
one's popping off and it was like such
such a such a hot mess but after years
and years of practice I finally got it
down and you will too if you want to do
it if you want to get down the Lapp
location you can do it I promise
so practice makes perfect keep that in
mind so thank you so much for watching I
hope you enjoy this look I love you guys
and I'll see you soon bye I can't even
like do the kissy face properly with
these damn lips I'm like and I look at
myself in the viewfinder oh my god who
elf is that like it just looks so like
whoa like this no makeup makeup look is
gonna require 1268 projects oh and
seventeen layers of concealer layers and
it's not going to like chunk up a ball
off or anything chunk up or ball off
interesting choice of words chuckling
okay wait where's my gods you can't
escape the Biot here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
