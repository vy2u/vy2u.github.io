this festive holiday makeup tutorial for
you I've seen so many of you guys asking
me for just like a classic Christmas
look with red glossy lips so I figured I
would kind of start off like my holiday
and New Year's Eve
looks by doing that classic red glossy
lip glitter on the cheeks and black
winged liner so I wear this look every
single Christmas time I absolutely love
it it just screams holidays to me so I
figured I would go ahead and share it
with you guys acting in this video I do
show you how you can replace the red lip
with a pink lip and still make it look
festive because pink lips are definitely
not just for spring and summer they're
totally festive for winter time and
totally work but a lot of people think
that it's only like a summery thing so
yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed the
video I love you so much and Happy
Holidays hi
first thing I'm going to do is take
makeup geek creme brulée you guys have
seen me use this a million times but I
loved it so much so why not make it a
million and one using a fluffy blending
brush I am just going to put this on the
outer corner of my eyes my eyes are
already primed that's definitely
necessary before you put any shadow on
then I'm going to go in and take makeup
geek beaches and cream I think this is
very important it's not necessary but
this is really what's going to give you
that flawless perfectly airbrushed
blended out look is taking a shade that
is basically your skin tone and using
that to really blend out everything then
I'm going in with the shade of vanilla
again this is by makeup geek another
great shade is grain by Mac it's
basically this exact same color but it
has a little bit of Sheen to it whatever
you choose you want it to be pretty much
like your skin tone maybe a shade or two
lighter and not have too much shimmer in
it we want the shadow to be pretty
neutral and then we're going to go in
with another makeup geek and this is
called frappe you guys are the ones who
told me that I needed this shadow you
couldn't believe that I didn't have it
in my collection so I got it on your
recommendation and you're not going to
be surprised to hear that
well I'm obsessed with it it's
absolutely gorgeous it's the perfect
amount of warm shades where it's so
universal and I really think that pretty
much everybody can wear this color so
I'm just putting that pretty densely
again in the outer corner and just
blending it out with everything else
then I'm using Maybelline eye studio gel
liner in the shade blackest black I'm
using an angle eyeliner brush any
eyeliner brush you're comfortable with
is perfectly fine and I'm going to trace
out the shape of my eyeliner I showed
you how I did this in my last tutorial
as well it I just love it so much it's
so easy for me it's literally like
coloring in a coloring book and just
tracing and following the lines now once
you have it filled and you can just
perfect your wing however you prefer it
and then with the power of editing
bada-bing done so I just put on a coat
of Rimmel mascara from the drugstore and
I'm going to pop on the lower lashes
over top of that I'm not sure exactly
which style this is but I will put that
in the bottom bar along with everything
else
then I'm going to put on my foundation
today I am using giorgio armani luminous
silk foundation even though it's called
them in a silk it's not super super
luminous and because I am still dealing
with my allergic reaction
especially in the right side of my face
I still have tons of texture so I wanted
to use something that wasn't super super
dewy to bring even more attraction to
that area then I'm going to use my
concealer which is my mac cosmetics Pro
Longwear concealer and shade nw20 and
I'm going to keep this only under my eye
area
I'm not going to highlight any other
places on my face because again I don't
want to highlight that breakout that I
have going on right now from that
product that I use if you guys don't
watch my vlog then you know what I'm
talking about but I had an allergic
reaction to a self-tanner that I use on
my face then I'm going to go in with Mac
Pro to different highlighting powders
one and emphasized and one and
accentuate and with a sigma tapered
highlighting brush I'm just going to set
my under eye concealer so it doesn't
move and bada-bing brows are done then
I'm going to go in with Mac shroom
eyeshadow favorite eyeshadow all-time
for highlighting it seriously works on
pretty much every skin tone it's just
perfect and I am using a sigma concealer
brush to highlight don't ask I've been
using it for like a month and a half now
to highlight and I love it then I'm
using Makeup Forever bronzer and number
20 and I'm also using the NARS contour
brush I did do an entire video about
contouring using this brush I loved it
so much but today I'm going to not
really contour but more just bronze I
want this to be a very soft contour
since we already had the black winged
liner the glittery cheeks the red lips
we do not need a harsh contour we want
it to be more soft a little bit more
natural-looking some going in with a big
buffer brush and I'm just blending all
of that out so that there is not any
harsh line because that can just make it
way too dramatic so as you can see it's
starting to look a little bit more
softer airbrush a little bit more
natural then we're going to go in with
the Tarte Amazonian clay holiday palette
using that Center color right there it's
this really pretty matte apricot shade
and we're just going to blend that all
over the cheeks this is the MAC
Cosmetics 129 short handle blush brush
I've used for years I don't know why but
if it's not broken don't fix it then I
am going to go in again with the makeup
geek frappe eyeshadow using a small flat
definer brush starting on the outer
corner of the lower lash line and
blending it inward you can make this as
dark as you want you can line your
waterline you can do whatever you please
I personally don't want my under eye
area to be
tense so I'm just using that shadow and
then blending it out with creme brulee I
want it to be a little bit more natural
under there I want the main focus to
definitely be the eyeliner on the eyes
and then the lips and highlighted cheek
so just blend that out buff buff buff
don't get frustrated keep buffing then
I'm going to coat my lower lashes with
Rimmel lash accelerator just so that
they're not leaving hanging there all by
themselves now I'm going to go in with
Laura Mercier highlighter and 0/1 and
with a little precise brush this is the
tapered highlighting brush from Sigma
I'm just going to place this all over
the top of my cheekbones exactly where I
want that base of highlight to be then
the fun part comes I am going to be
using a loose glitter by Mac and this is
from the Wonder Woman collection they
still have it it's a Mac Pro item it's
online or on ProSource I will list it
below in the description bar then using
a fluffy brush I'm going to just place
this on top of that Laura Mercier
highlighter and a little bit more of a
precise area I don't drag this
everywhere I want it to sit in a very
specific spot on the very high point of
my cheeks you can wet your brush with
water or eye drops or mac fix+ or Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray if you
want it to be even more intense I want
it to be a little bit softer but I will
set my entire face with Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray just because
doing this will make sure that glitter
doesn't fall down on your face
throughout the night and just completely
disappear it will really keep it in its
place now I am applying a revlon
colorburst lip balm and this is in the
shade Zoe
Nicole Guerrero actually gave me this
lip product and thank you so much
because I am so in love with it so as
you can see a pink lip can still totally
look festive it's just not as rich so we
can go with a red lip this is again a
Revlon lip balm this is a lacquer one so
it has more of a shine and a gloss to it
I love these products you don't need to
use a lip liner with the way that these
are shaped they're so easy to apply
it's the perfect warm red for this time
of year and it really will agree on
everyone so I really hope you enjoyed
this video you guys I love you so much
