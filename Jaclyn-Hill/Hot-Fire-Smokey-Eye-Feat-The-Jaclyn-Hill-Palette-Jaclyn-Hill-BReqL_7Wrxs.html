nigga tutorial with this balance so I
asked you guys on snapchat what look you

mind this being one of them and the
other one being kind of like my
signature smokey eye if you will the
same look that I was wearing in my like

just so happy to finally be filming this
I know that you guys have seen about 500

if you enjoy it please give the video a
thumbs up please subscribe to my channel
you know how much I appreciate it
leave your requests for a look that you
like to see it down below and I will see
you in my next video I hope you enjoy
alright so I already have on my base
like my foundation my concealer and my
powder and I have on my brows so I look
a little weird right now I know but
it'll all come together in the end I
promise you see those swatches of my
palette
alright I'm gonna start off with MFE oh
it is the fourth shade in the palette
and this is a mask kind of medium tone
warm Brown I created a shade
specifically for the transition color
which is what I'm doing right now might
want to make sure I'm in focus you guys
are my gonna see me looking over this
way a lot to make sure that I stay in
focus throughout the video so taking a
fluffy brush I'm just gonna start off
right here in the upper crease which is
the transition area oh my gosh I can't
believe I'm actually using this is crazy
let's do surreal okay I'm gonna make
this deafen the most pigmented on the
outer part of the eye
but as I blend that out I'm going to
begin to bring it to the inner corner as
well but I'm gonna keep it pretty low I
don't want it to come too high up in
here by my brow I'm gonna keep it nice
and low in this area just but it doesn't
get sloppy and then once we're over here
in the outer corner again I will just
have to bring it up a little bit towards
the brow now I basically have nothing
left on my brush we're just blending it
out if you need you can talk to me I'm
filming
a tutorial so I'm talking to the camera
but it's like you can talk to me this is
the first time I'm using my palette on
camera babe awesome this is crazy I'm
freaking out like I'm really so give you
right now like I can't believe that I'm
actually using my palette on camera this
is crazy
so see makes you look really crooked so
wear your retainer alright next I'm
going to go in with the shade butter
which is the second color and the second
row sorry I'm not mean to flip you
because I saw okay now that's just the
finger that popped up I'm gonna go in
with a little bit more of a denser brush
this is the m-44 line of by morphe I'm
gonna pick a little bit of that up and
just go right over that area the reason
I chose this color butter as opposed to
the other ones is because this one does
have a lot more like an orange II really
really warm tone to it and I don't want
it to be as much Brown as I want it to
be a very kind of Orange II and very
warm for this look so putting this a
little bit deeper down into that outer
corner keeping it right there in my
crease and if you don't have a really
defined crease that's okay you can just
carve it out and you can create your own
crease with the shadow that's what's the
beauty of makeup honestly you can create
you increase creature of a different no
it was a different face shaped creator
whatever the hell you want with makeup
you can create a different light if you
really need to and then just like the
first color I'm going to just lightly
bring it in to the inner corner of my
eye and whenever I do this I raise my
eyebrow just because I feel like when my
eyes are done like this I have more skin
7 down in that area and when I raise my
eyebrow up I can get really nice and
precise in there and make it look way
more blended so I raise my eyebrow up
and I get really tight in that inner
corner then I'm gonna pick up the shade
Q key which is right here the center of
the palette I still can't believe that I
actually named the shape Yuki and I'm
just gonna run that over everything that
I
because this really warm my caramel
brown is just really gonna warm this up
and also deepen it and I'm just keeping
it nice and low in this transition area
of course I never start anything off
high if you've noticed I always keep
everything very low initially and then I
blend upward once the product is down
I'm gonna take some translucent powder
on a small angled brush right now and I
am just going to use this to carve out
where I want my shadow to stop so that
nothing gets messy I do this all the
time almost any time I ever do my
foundation first and then my eyes I
always do this technique just because it
keeps it so clean I actually do
recommend doing your eyes first though
it can just be a little more
time-consuming if you do your eyes
person and go with your foundation I
think doing a foundation first is much
faster but if I have like a really nice
event or if I'm doing something where I
want to look like extra certain that I'm
focused doing so I want to look like
extra like just perfect then I will do
my eyes first on my foundation second
because it just makes your foundation
look its absolute best and then I was
going to lightly put some of this trans
as a powder here so that if we have any
fall out when we're packing on these
colors it just catches it this step is
not necessary to create this eye look
but it's just what I recommend it's what
I always recommend no matter what shadow
is you're working with it's just a
technique I'm using for a very long time
but I think it just makes everything
look so much more flawless and put
together in the end and I'm gonna go in
with a shade Roxanne which is one of my
favorite colors in the palette it isn't
as beautiful just like kind of deep very
matte brick red and picking up an m57 3
it's like a little bit more taper but
it's still a very long and a great
blending brush I'm gonna go ahead and
just start popping this right there in
that crease area so because of this
color
the same thing just gonna bring this
into my inner corner keeping it really
low and nice and deep okay now I'm gonna
go in with the shade hunts which is such
a beautiful just like rich intense like
a deep orange it is so creamy and so
pigmented a tiny bit goes such a long
way and now with hunts I'm just gonna go
over pretty much everything in the upper
crease area just to really make it a lot
more orange as opposed to like brick
like I want it to have the depth of that
dark color but not now I want to go in
on the whole edge you just basically
make it look more like fire
I'm gonna pick up a little bit of
creamsicle right here which is another
matte shade so far I have used only
mattes this entire tutorial and I'm
gonna take barely any of that on my
brush and just go over the edges again
just right there at that point where
everything is coming to an end just to
make sure do we have what no harsh lines
I brought this look up really high I
didn't intend to bring this up like all
the way to my brow basically but
whatever we are does gonna work okay now
I'm gonna go in with Roxanne which is
this really dark kind of like brick
rusty copper shade and it is a shimmer
I'm gonna pick this up on a mac 242
brush right here and I'm also going to
wet my brush with fix+ you don't have to
do this but I let my brushes fix+ before
I go in with any sure that's how it's
been for the past I would say two years
at this point I don't even bother going
with the shimmer without it because I
like my shimmers to really pop and be
extra so if you want them to be way more
metallic then I would wet your brush
with anything you can use fix+ any
setting spray that you have you can use
typically they'll all work you can also
use eye drops you can't use water water
won't work as well for some reason but
just wetting your brush with any spray
that you do have will do the job
and I'm just gonna pack this color on
all over the entire lid area it
basically already looks like the colors
that we already have going on on the eye
but this is just shimmery okay now I'm
going to pick up a little bit of
firework and queen and I'm gonna mix
both of these together like a little dab
with this one first and then I'll take a
little bit of Queen on my brush because
I don't have to be super gold but I also
don't want to go in with a got straight
copper either I just want to make you
know that's why I put so many heat
shades like this in the palette so as
you can mix them up and have fun with
them I'm gonna damp my brush again with
some fix+
I'm gonna pop that right here in the
center of my lid oh my god
and I am using a very small amount of
product when doing all of this by the
way you guys like very very small amount
because I I don't know I don't mind like
to be to it and your face I want the
entire eye overall just like this really
beautiful warm blown out smoke I don't
want the lid to be like the thing that
stands out the most you know I want it
all to come together okay I was gonna
wipe away now any of that Transat outer
that is still under there I'm gonna move
on to the lower lash line now but I will
probably most definitely actually come
back up and do a little bit more work on
the upper lid but right now I just want
to kind of move to the bottom and kind
of get this shape going picking up a
pencil brush I'm gonna grab the shade of
pukey I just kind of connect what I did
on the upper lid to the lower lashline
so as you can see like I have that like
wing right there I'm just gonna go ahead
and connect that with the shadow and
just bring that down
then I'm gonna grab some mocha which is
this matte dark kind of fudgy Brown down
there on the second-to-last row on a
definer brush I'm just gonna put that
directly on my lower lash line I'm gonna
pick up a little bit of roxanne and
hunts just a pinch of each just the week
tool bit on my pencil brush and i'm
gonna go on this entire lower lashes
blend all that out oh yes honey
give me a that blown out smoky warm oh
my gosh I love it all right I'm going to
go back and with a little bit more of
translucent powder just to make sure
that this is nice and crisp and tight in
there I'm gonna do a little bit more
work on my upper lid and I just don't
want anything to get messy so I'm just
gonna take all the steps of precaution
I'm just gonna go back in with Roxanne
and hunts on a blending brush and I'm
just going to package a little bit more
intense right out here in the outer
corner
you know for highlighting my brow bone
I'm gonna go in with the first shade in
the palette which is in light I am so
freakin obsessed with this color for
having my brow bone in the inner corner
the pigmentation and the formula and the
way it swatches is just absolute
perfection if you ask me for a highlight
it is just like so creamy and so satin
in the tiniest bit like I barely even
touch my skin and it's just so smooth
and beautiful
alright I'm gonna take the same shade
and I'm gonna pop that on the inner
corner of the eye
I cannot go a day without inner corner
highlight or you could even hey love it
so much I'm mixing a little bit of the
second color and the palate which is the
shade beam has a little bit of a more
yellow undertone we're gonna mix that
for that inner corner alright for lashes
I'm gonna go in with flutter lash
intoxicating these are some of my
favorite lashes ever they are so long
and fluffy and flirty and sexy and just
everything I ever wanted to lash
intoxicating is it okay lashes are on
what a difference they make let me tell
you now I'm gonna put a little bit of
black liquid liner in my lower waterline
just to really like deepen and intensify
this look what you do not have to do at
all you just do mascara of course and be
good to go but I want to really make
this look extra oh let's know let me
take a little bit of the Maybelline
blackest black gel liner on just a
little teeny tiny eyeliner brush I'm
just going to line the inner rim of my
eye with this you can just use an eye
cool that will work just as well but
this is what I have been doing it in the
past six months or so and I just love it
it's just so quick and easy and it does
not move all day all right I'm just
gonna put some mascara on my lower
lashes of course to finish off the eye
look and eyes are complete I figured I
would just finish the rest of my face on
camera and so I'm just like cutting it
at the eyes just so you can see the
completed look I'm gonna go in with some
bronzer by colour-pop this is the
highlight bronzer duo in the shade topaz
I'm gonna be using a more feet are too
as my bronzer brush one of my favorites
tap off the excess and just go in in
bronze away dolly I love this bronzer
because it has such a warm undertone and
when you're doing really warm shadows on
your eyes like I did today a bronzer
with this undertone is really
complementary then I'm gonna take
another color pop highlighting blush duo
I don't know what this one is called
honestly I'm gonna grab some this way
put this on that brush I am so dumb that
is not whatever there's no turning back
now it is what it is I just want to do a
nice like Capri a warm peachy blush to
really compliment this look and make it
very monochromatic this is like
seriously my favorite part I'm doing my
face is setting my brows with clear brow
gel such a simple and fast easy thing
but I swear like if I leave the house
without clear brow gel it's just it's a
bad day I just got this highlighter in
the mail it's from the jeffree star
cosmetics summer collection this pink
chrome packaging is so dope in this
color is just like the craziest most
just like amazing intriguing color to me
it's called a summer snow cone it has
such like a vibrant yellow e undertone
and I really think that it'll complement
this warm I look so I want to try it out
I love how different this is it's like
there's nothing like that I just
realized that the brush that I used to
apply this highlight has brown on it
this is the brush that I use to fill in
my hairline yesterday and that's why
this highlight looks dingy and green um
let me think
okay
okay after five minutes trying to buff
that off my face using multiple
different things and reapplying my
bronzer and my blush I feel like I
pretty much got rid of the brown it's
not perfect definitely I can see some
patches right here they're driving me a
little crazy but that's okay we're gonna
go back in with my regular brush that I
found my goodness it should have done
that in the first place just try that
again shall we
okay I know it's a cool color I love it
alright for the other high points of my
face I'm gonna be using some champagne
pop just because I think that that one
will look a little too yellow we like on
my nose and my Cupid's bow so I'm gonna
take some champagne pop and use that on
the other areas
all right for my lips I'm going to go in
with my favorite lipliner recently which
is the Charlotte Tilbury iconic nude lip
cheats such a beautiful color I'm gonna
go ahead and just line up my lips and
completely fill them in
like how pretty is that color just on
its own it's such a gorgeous lip liner
now I'm gonna pick up some blush nude by
Tom Ford which is one my favorite new
lipsticks ever I'm just going to go
ahead and put that right over top of it
then over top of that I'm gonna go in
with the Dior lip Maximizer and lip
gloss in the shade
0:01 this has been like my favorite
favorite gloss recently it just makes
your lips look so just like wet and
pouty so I take it and I run it over
like that and then I do not put it back
in the tube with like the messiness on
it I wipe it on a paper towel to get
like the color off of it otherwise the
lip gloss is gonna turn the color of
your lipstick and that kind of grosses
me out so I just go over it and then I
wipe it off and then I put it back on
the tube I've been wearing this lip
combination like crazy recently and any
time I have it on on snapchat or in my
last video I get so many questions about
what it is so I figured I would do it
for you guys today it is a very
expensive lip combination I will give it
to you but it's beautiful I've been
loving it okay last but not least a
let's set this with some setting spray
I'm gonna use I don't know why I always
shake but you know it doesn't need to be
shooken shaken sugar shaked this is the
more you prep in set it has been my
favorite to makeup setting spray
recently oh my gosh since I have done
this I have not used any other makeup
