to be doing a very in-depth talks or
tutorial on how to apply contour blush
highlight and baking yo face basically
all the steps to achieve that flawless
face that we all see all over Instagram
and all the celebrity makeup artists are
doing on all the celebrities I'm going
to take you through every single step
I'm gonna give you the do's and the
don'ts the wise and the why nots so
let's get started and I'm going to zoom
you in a little bit so that you can see
the fist okay alright so at this point I
have primed my skin and I have on a
sheer to medium coverage foundation
right now you can put on any foundation
it does not matter whatever you love it
can be sheer it can be full coverage it
can be mass it can be dewy
whatever foundation you love just slap
it on your skin and then we can move on
so I am going to apply concealer on
camera because that is part of this
entire process and the reason being is
because depending the technique that you
want to use to do your makeup that day
you are going to want to change the
color of your concealer so for instance
if I'm just going to put on some mascara
a sheer foundation and some concealer
I'm going to use a concealer that's only
one shade lighter than my foundation or
maybe even the same shade as my
foundation on a day like today when we
are going to do full beit's and we're
going to do every single step the whole
jazz routine a full face glam look I'm
going to go a couple shades on with my
concealer maybe in between two to four
shades lighter and the reason being is
as you will see throughout this video my
concealer color is going to change and
you're going to be happy that you have
on a lighter concealer because the end
look is going to be very structured and
defined and that's what this entire
thing is all about to be like that
flawless face so I'm going to grab the
Urban Decay Naked skin weightless
concealer this is my absolute favorite
concealer and that is because it doesn't
crease I need the eyes especially with
the way that I'm going to set it and
because the fact that it's very
hydrating and I am definitely dry in
this area so I want a more hydrating
concealer if you are more oily and you
have a really big issue with step
creasing I would also recommend the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer it was one of my
writer dies for years it's just a little
bit too dry on me I've noticed so I'm
going to be using a shade light warm and
I am going to just use this stick and
apply a line under here aligned on the
side of the nose and a line here
I'm gonna do the same over here yes
honey we are gonna look cute during this
process I'm also going to apply a cross
on the chin a line right here
right there and right down the center of
the nose all right so I'm just going to
pick up a damp sponge and I'm going to
begin to blend this out I personally
love love blending out my concealer with
a damp sponge and it's also going to
come in handy when it comes time to bake
the face I personally think that a damp
sponge whether it's a Beauty Blender or
like a different brand I think a damp
sponge blend out concealer better than
anything else in my opinion like the
past year and a half I've been so loyal
to using a damp Beauty Blender because I
just think it looks so flawless
underneath the eyes and what I love so
much about using a damp sponge to apply
the concealer is that you're pressing
into the skin as opposed to when you're
using a brush you're like dragging like
this and not only is it like more gentle
on the under eye area but I love that
it's pressing the concealer into the
skin not to mention the moisture will
pick up any excess concealer that you
have so if you applied way too much and
you were way too generous your Beauty
Blender will pick up the excess so that
it doesn't get cakey on your under eye
okay and then of course we're just going
to blend everything else out as well
adding the highlight to the center of
the face it's just going to make
everything look more natural I always
have to put it in quotations because
let's get real there's nothing natural
about this look but in the end of all of
this it is going to look so much more
put together and natural esque as
opposed to just having a highlight here
and then nothing in the center of the
face you want to bring the center of the
face and the under eye together so that
everything kind of matches and looks in
sync and this nsync such a good band now
we have applied the concealer on the
under eye area in the center of the face
I'm going to grab my translucent powder
and this is the RCM a no color
translucent powder i absolutely love
this powder it's my favorite because i
am dry if you are oily I would really
recommend the Laura Mercier translucent
powder it is absolutely amazing I use it
for so long until I discovered this one
and this one is just so much better on
dry skin so I'm going to put some this
powder into the cap right here so I can
just work with it straight out of the
just make a total mess no big deal now
I'm going to do is going to take that
same damp Beauty Blender that we use for
the under-eye and I'm going to dip it
into this cap directly into that
translucent powder this scared the crap
out of me the first time that I did it
I'm not going to lie because you're
always taught you can't mix water with
powder you can't mix liquids and powders
like they need to be done separately you
know and so taking a damp Beauty Blender
and dipping into powder I'm like don't
put that up my face like it's like
terrifying but I promise you this works
if you want to set that under-eye
concealer like nobody's business try
this trick it will change your life
there are different options for you if
you do not want to use the damp Beauty
Blender and translucent powder a method
you could do something like this and use
just like an under-eye powder to set it
you could use something like the Mac Pro
emphasized which comes in a bunch of
different shades for the under eye area
depending on your skin tone and that's
on mac cosmetics calm and then this
right here is the Anastasia banana
powder I love using these two together
and separately for my under eyes but for
the purpose of today's video I'm going
to show you this method because this in
my personal opinion will make that
under-eye stay in place all day long it
doesn't matter what you're doing your
under-eye area is not going to move so
I'm going to go ahead take the stand
Beauty Blender grab a little bit more
because I've been shaking it around and
what I'm going to do is just tap it
directly on the under-eye area and I
love this powder so much because the
Laura Mercier translucent powder like
not to sound like a hater or anything on
me because I have dry under eyes it just
makes that under I feel like so creepy
when I smile I'm like ah I feel like I
could like having trouble smiling
because it makes that under-eye area so
dry whereas the RCM a no color powder
that I'm using right now
doesn't do that it does not feel dry on
the skin you're not going to want to
wipe because then you'll make a mess of
your makeup just press directly into the
skin the entire time you want to look up
and really make sure that you're getting
on the under-eye because that's where we
all crease and just press press press
dab dab dab bring it right there on the
side of the nose down and there you go
you do not need to bring this down all
the way to here sorry I keep looking in
my viewfinder to see my face I'm just
trying to
some focus but you do not need to bring
the translucent powder all the way down
here because this isn't highlighting or
anything you've already done that the
concealer this is just simply setting
where you would typically crease so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
lightly set my entire face with a face
powder you do not have to do this if
you're crazy dry or if you haven't found
a power of the to love or if you just
like going and directly with powders
over top of your cream foundation I did
that for years and years and years but
I'm just going to set my face really
quickly so that you guys can get the
entire like full demo for those of you
who do set your face I am using the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk powder
foundation I absolutely love this stuff
like more than life I just discovered it
recently and it hadn't become like an
absolute staple at my collection I also
love the Mac mineralized skinfinish
pressed powder so beautiful that one is
way more affordable if you're looking
for something that's a little bit easier
on your wallet now have foundation
concealer we have our under eye area set
and we have our face set so everything
is good to go right so now at this point
this is when we're going to begin
actually the baking the contouring the
highlighting and all that jazz so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
pick up a ridiculous amount of
translucent powder and I'm going to
really get on that Beauty Blender and
I'm going to literally go directly and
under my eyes and just stamp and you
want it to be as thick as possible and I
will explain why I look like a
psychopath right now
so I'm sure some of you right now we're
thinking okay what is the difference
between setting your under eye area and
baking your under eye area and I will
tell you the difference is when you set
your under eye area that's all you're
doing you're just setting your under eye
and you're moving along with your day
when you bake your under eye area you
are making that bitch bulletproof that
is the difference
drag queens have been using this
technique for ever we basically glamour
makeup takes everything from the drag
world you want to know how to do good
makeup go interview a queen because
seriously that's where all of this stuff
comes from his drag queens get on stage
they perform they're under hot lights
they're dancing yeah they are working
and they need their makeup to stay in
place they need their makeup to not move
they need to be perfect through sweat
through dancing through the hot lights
through everything and so they came up
with this technique a long long long
time ago and we stole it from them
something that I thought was so freaking
cool when I heard this fact and I have
to share it with you is the reason that
it is called baking or cooking in the
first place is because when you apply a
ton of translucent powder to the skin
that area of the face basically can't
breathe and what ends up happening is
your body temperature which is typically
around ninety eight point six degrees
give or take comes through and gets
trapped between the face and the
Transit's mpow durand it literally cooks
the concealer cooks the foundation cooks
the makeup and becomes bulletproof it is
the coolest thing in the world when you
think about like that you are literally
cooking your face at 98.6 degrees turn
that up and on 98.6 and let's get cookin
you want to bake any other areas of the
face you can go ahead and do so I
personally like to just do the under eye
area when I do this method because I
don't want to make the other areas of my
face - Matt and I really don't have an
issue with other areas moving or not
looking really nice but a lot of people
like to bake the chin as well because of
the fact that your chin can really tend
to kind of break up and the reason being
is because a lot of times you'll rest
your hand on your chin you'll be like
this you'll do this you'll hug people
and your makeup will just come up on
your chin so if you want to make your
chin that is a very common thing to do
Dan girl I'm looking so cute right now
all right so now that our face is
cooking we are going to move on to
contour and honestly contouring can be
very overwhelming because there's so
many products out there there's so many
brushes out there there's many different
opinions out there some people say that
if you're going to contour you acts
you have to use a contouring powder that
is a cool tone I'm gonna argue with that
I do not think that a contour powder
needs to be a cool tone actually I know
that doesn't have to be because there
are some people out there that if they
put on a cool tone powder on their face
it's gonna look even outside playing in
the dirt that's just how it happened you
me look muddy and gray and it doesn't
work some people need a more neutral
colors some people need a warmer color
it just depends on your skin tone I will
say that overall I think that benefit
hoola bronzer is a really beautiful
color for contour it's a nice neutral it
doesn't have too much red or too much
grey in it and it really does help
create and eyeshadow on a lot of
different skin tones it's a really nice
color my perfect color personally is Mac
shape ster I just recently found this
like in the last year maybe like six to
seven months or so if you feel like you
haven't found the perfect shade yet like
it's all good some people use bronzers
some people use face powder some people
use colors they're specifically made for
contour fine works for you and that's
what you need that's it just one good
contour color and you're good to go and
then as far as brushes there are so many
so I will just tell you my top two phase
first off is this one right here this is
the morphe m-52 3 i love it because it's
longest bristles around the center and
it has the shorter bristles on the side
so it gives you a nice line while still
blending it out makes it nice and smooth
and the other one is the NARS eita brush
I've been talking about that brush for
years even though I don't use it that
often
every time I pick it up I'm like why do
I use this anymore it is so amazing it's
so easy to secrete eight that nice line
that sharp line cuz I'm going to just
grab the shade Sur powder by Mac and I'm
going to put it on both sides of the
brush the reason why I put it on both
sides not just one side is because when
I blend out I'm going to want it to be
on both sides to help me get that
perfect smooth blending a flawless
finish so the past couple of months I
have changed up the way I've done my
contour and I've had so many people tell
me that I've lost weight in my face and
I'm like no I haven't the scale would
not agree with you but I think it is
truly the way that I've been contouring
because I used to contour in the top of
my ear down towards the core of my mouth
stop right at the edge of my eye and I
would kind of round out a little bit
like to give that round cheek look which
I still do go from the top of my ear and
I still do stop at the corner of my eye
but now I just make that line very harsh
and I
don't like using the word harsh because
no one wants a harsh line on their face
but it's the truth instead of rounding
it now I have it way more angle and I
scotch and I make it much more cut as
opposed to rounded out like I used to so
I'm going to grab my brush I'm going to
start right here at the corner of my ear
and having face powder right here in the
area where you're going to contour is
going to really really really help in
the blending and smoothing out process
and making it look more natural so I'm
going to start right here at the corner
of the ear and I'm going to begin just
to work downward and as you can see I do
not have a ton of my brush because I
rather have too little than too much and
so in the past I would have gone more
like this down this way like that but
now I'm going to go more up and down
like this if you can see that right
there same thing over here I'm just
going down at an angle and if you're
rubbing off that translucent powder and
that's fine don't worry about it you can
go ahead and rub it off you can do the
transfers in powder after contour or
before contour there's no rules and
makeup whatsoever and like I said before
if there were I would break them anyway
but you can do your baking in the
beginning or at the end you can do
whenever you want
alright so now I'm going to go up on the
forehead and the reason that you want to
contour your forehead do not my my baby
hairs going in I don't want to talk
about it no really I don't want to talk
about it um but the reason why you
contour your forehead is because now if
you have added the shadow down here and
made this slim in and you've added depth
to the face now it's like oh hello
forehead like so in your face so all
you're gonna do is go to the hairline
right over on the edges and you're just
going to slim this out if you have a
tiny forehead like an O head then you do
not need to worry about contouring your
forehead at all you can completely leave
it alone
unless you feel personally like it looks
a little blank it looks a little blah it
looks like people are gonna stare my
forehead then you can contour it if you
ever feel like you're doing your contour
and it's just not blending properly
something you can do is go back with
like your powder brush and your face
powder and just get a little bit on that
brush not much because you don't want
coverage it'll just help blend
everything out and kind of going back
over that and
gain your face powder and the contour
powder together will make things look a
lot more flawless and more natural its
contour line right here that's kind of
sloppy and kind of unblended and needs a
little bit of help which I'm going to be
honest I just like slapped it on my face
because I knew I was going to be baking
it and cleaning it up I'm going to grab
a define brush you can also just use a
makeup wedge like from the drugstore you
can get like a pack for like 2 bucks and
just use any wedge that you have I'm
just going to use this brush right here
this is a morphe m/45 9 is a brand new
one I love this brush if you watch my
videos you know I use this brush in
every single video to do this exact
thing I'm doing right now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go right beneath
that contour so that contour is right
here and it's going to go downward and
what I'm going to do is stamp it out
like that so that I am just helping make
that line sharper so that it looks like
a shadow under there
if you wanted you could just grab a
brush right now and just wipe it away
and you will see a very noticeable
difference immediately and it will clean
up that contour but if you want to let
it bake so that it doesn't move and if
you're going to be out all day and you
want that contour to stay in place for
hours and hours then let that powder sit
on the skin for 5 10 even 15 minutes and
it will make it so that is it all day
long all right so now at this point I'm
going to wipe away my under eye area
this bacod if you will and you will see
that everything underneath the eye is
going to look very flawless very
airbrushed very matte you can use a big
brush to wipe this away you can use a
small brush to wipe it away whatever you
prefer I am just kind of wiping away
some of the contour that I got right
here and blending it out because I don't
really want contour on my temples
because if you have contour on your
temples will kind of bring in your face
and if you want to have a more higher
cheekbone and kind of looking your face
is kind of wider and brought back up
here then you wouldn't want any contour
right here on the temple area alright so
now we are going to apply blush and for
today's video I'm going to be using the
face palette that I created with Becca
cosmetics this is the champagne
collection based Alice I'm so excited I
feel so cheesy I haven't opened this up
on camera yet ain't she Purdy to apply
blush I'm going to be using my personal
favorite blush brush of all time and
this is the like I don't have the
numbers of anything memorize the e for
it's basically worn off on mine I
absolutely love this guys so much it is
a synthetic brush which I love is I
personally don't love using a goat hair
for my blush I feel like it doesn't
apply it the way I want it to I love
using a synthetic hair whatever you have
though works for you whatever blush
brush you love that's what you should be
using now for blush I'm going to apply
it on the apple of my cheek but I'm not
going to apply it too close to my nose
because now that's going to bring us in
word and that's going to give us a round
face and we want to keep this like
sculpted face right so basically I'm
going to do is you can smile and you do
not want to apply the blush right here
in the side of the face because you
might look a little bit like a clown so
what you're going to do was instead of
putting it right here
you're going to put it right here I
always angle my brush to the side like
this and I
to sweep my blush backward and upward so
I don't want to put it down into my
contour I kind of just bring it like
this up toward the temple but I'm not
going to go all the way to the temple
you know what I mean
I always initially go in with very very
soft sweeping motions just to get the
product on really lightly and evenly and
then I will swirl it around make sure
that it's blended and nice and smooth ok
so now we're going to move on to
highlighting which load is a whole video
in itself if you ask me there are
different techniques in highlighting you
can do an all-over highlight that's all
over the entire cheek area you can do a
more specific highlight that's just on
the center of the cheek or just back
here in the high point of the cheekbone
you can highlight your cheeks and then
apply blush doing that will make it look
a little bit more subtle a little bit
more like it's kind of a glow from
within if you will or you can do it the
way I am and do contour blush and then
highlight on top you can use a smaller
brush and make it more just in one area
or you use a larger brush and make it
more of an all-over glow it's totally up
to you but you can kind of play around
and see what you love on your face shape
and your skin type well I'm going to be
mixing champagne pop and Prosecco pop
together champagne pop is more of a
peachy light glow and Prosecco pop is a
true golden glow so I'm going to mix
those two together and the way I've been
highlighting recently is I've actually
been concentrating my highlight on the
center of my cheeks because I think that
it looks the prettiest when I smile as
opposed to back here when I have too
much highlight on the tops of my
cheekbones I feel like when I smile it
creates like this weird like indention
thing from straight on only lets go from
the side so I've been highlighting the
center of my cheeks the most so I'm just
gonna take it and just sweep it as I'm
smiling right on the apple of my cheek
you can see right there and then once I
have it on the Apple the cheek I will
just lightly go back over top of my
blush
all right so now if you want to
highlight the center of your nose you
can I never highlight my nose I guess
I'll open I'm video I don't like my nose
so I don't like bringing attention to it
but if you want to put a little dink you
totally can
not for me but it looks good on a lot of
people you can also highlight the chin
if you want this is something that not a
lot of people are going to want to do
only if you are dry and you feel like
your skin looks extremely dehydrated you
want to highlight your chin a little bit
the top of the Cupid's bow right here is
a great place to highlight I look great
it's to highlight um recently I've
actually been highlighting my lips if
I'm wearing a matte lipstick I will take
my highlight and just run it right over
the center of the lips okay my lips are
chapped as hell right now so that's not
a good look
hold on hello IRA do that coming in 2017
okay that's better you can even
highlight the forehead if you want right
above the brow is a great place it will
give a lift to the brow without looking
too noticeable right there
a nice little shine I like doing this in
the summer because I think it looks
really like you know summertime so now
I'm just going to wipe away down here
obviously we are not going to leave the
house looking like that so that you can
see the way the contour looks now that
that has been wiped off you can see it's
nice and sharp but it's not so harsh
that it looks ridiculous this powder
doesn't make it go away to the point
that you're like oh my god like when you
grab a piece of paper use that to
contour with yes all right you guys that
