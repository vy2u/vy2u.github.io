talking about contouring this is a very
requested video and I'm very excited to
do it I talked about this brush I used
it in a like you know a month and a half
ago or so in a video and I got so many
requests to talk about it more in depth
and I'm very excited too because I must
say right off the bat this brush has
changed my life when it comes to
contouring and sculpting out anyone's
face
it makes it so easy I mean a monkey
could contour with this brush so go NARS
you guys did an amazing brush awesome
job okay so this right here is the NARS
I don't know how to pronounce it it's
ITA so I don't know if it's Itza or ayto
but the NARS ITA brush is the name of
this bad boy it is small and it is oh so
powerful so I'm just going to
demonstrate of how I personally contour
so right now I have my makeup done with
nothing on the face so I don't have the
highlight I don't have the contour or
the blush or any of that I just have
powder set right here in this area just
to set the nose and t-zone because that
always just falls apart on me so that's
all I really have going on along with
foundation on the face so I'm just going
to show you step by step how I contour
so today I'm going to be using the
benefit hoola bronzer I figured I am
sorry this pinky is going to be all up
in the camera the entire time it's so
awkward so try to use my left hand as
much as possible this is the benefit
hoola bronzer this is a really beautiful
Universal bronzer I think that basically
anybody can use this shade it's not too
orange and it's not too Brown it looks
like that inside I always used to go
look at it and be like that's way too
light it's not going to be a bronzer for
me and I used to be an NC 40 and Mac
Foundation which is like a golden all of
the medium dark tone and it's it's very
tan and I would look at this and dig
that's not going to work as a bronzer on
me and then I saw someone else on
YouTube say the same thing and then how
they got it and it worked and I was like
maybe I should just try it and I don't
remember who that person was but then
when I purchased it and brought it home
it did this color is awesome so then I'm
going to take this brush I'm going to
just dip it in here like this and just
do a few swirls that's all I do so I
have this much on my brush I'm not going
to leave it like that so I'm going to
just tap off the excess so just a little
bit felt
in that process okay all right so I'm
going to be using the viewfinder I don't
have a mirror right now I only have the
camera with the viewfinder flipped
around so that's why I'm using the
contour so wish me luck because if you
find there's like this bit all right so
what a rule of thumb always is to start
from grab this to start from the top of
your ear down to the corner of your
mouth that's usually the rule so right
there you can see if I create a shadow
there that's going to make this area pop
out and this is the area that we want to
bring attention to so right there is
where you're going to want to start if
you bring it down too low then you're
going to make your cheekbones look saggy
so make sure you get up pretty high but
you never ever want to go higher than
the top of your ear and you want to make
sure that you're not doing this either
you don't want to make the line up there
otherwise you're going to have too much
space here and your face is going to
look out of proportion portion yeah okay
so make sure yourself in the ear and
make sure you angle it towards the
corner of that mouth all right so I'm
going to start with this brush right
here and I'm just going to touch that
area now with this brush what I do this
is very awkward with my pinky what I do
is I start here and then I just kind of
wiggle right in there I'm not going to
go any further than that so now you can
see that line that I have I do not bring
it down all the way because if I bring
it down into this area and when I'm
looking ahead on at someone it's gonna
look to sculpt it now if you're doing
drag queen makeup that is something
you're going to want to do you're going
to want to contour all the way to the
mouth but when you're doing everyday
beauty glamour HGTV ready makeup
anything like that you know brides
you're not going to want your contour to
come all the way to your mouth unless
you really want a dramatic contour now
we can bring it there lightly but not
yet so just make sure you do that on
both sides so again just a couple of
rubs in that bronzer and then you want
the excess off sorry my voice is still
coming in and out from being sick so you
can see on that brush there is not that
much powder on there it's very light so
we're going to do the same thing with
this side right here starting from the
top of that ear and just bringing it
towards the lip area but not all the way
so you can see how intense that line is
we want that line to be intense though
now without grabbing any other powder so
there's nothing on here no bronzer left
over we're just going to take this and
we're going to just go up and down so
before we went side to side and now
we're going to go up and down and this
is going to blend this contour out now
you don't want this to be huge
windshield wiper motions you don't want
to be going like this right now because
it's going to pretty much defeat the
purpose sorry I have like a hair you
need like a microscopic little hair
that's just tickling your face so you
just want to kind of wiggle it around
just to blend that out gently and at
this point if you want to bring it down
closer to the mouth area that's when you
can do this I would not recommend
initially going in and going like this
and bringing a line down it's going to
be too much in my experience so at this
point not you don't have that much now
you can bring it down and I prefer
instead of doing an extreme straight
line I prefer to slightly round it by
going kind of down and up and curving
the cheek that way you look like you
have that cheek right here is really
popping so you have that curved look
where it's swooping around it's more
natural so I'm just going to smooth that
area and there and move it around and at
this point I don't have anything
additional on my brush so I'm just kind
of messing with stuff so you can see
right there how different that is as
opposed to that line how we blended that
out and that looks so much more natural
so then again we just wiggle so all you
do is put it on in an intense line and
then wiggle it up and down
and then I begin to swoop again I make
that motion going up down and up just
swooping it in to that area and of
course you know you'll hear the classic
make the fishy base and contour what you
can do but I've noticed that when you do
that all it really does is suck in this
area which is not where I want to
concentrate my contour I want to
concentrate it back here and when you
doesn't really do much other than pop
that cheekbone out and suck this area in
so it's not it's never really helped me
I've never asked a client to make the
fishy face before I just asked them to
relax and if their cheekbones are
extremely hidden or they pretty much
don't have any then I will just line it
up and make the line where I know it's
supposed to go the fishy face has never
really helped me out in my experience so
there you have that and then what I will
do is take a little bit more
I never contour my face in just that
area and walk away you always want to
take it somewhere else so I'm holding it
sideways again like this and I'm going
to hit right here here is your temple I
would say go right above it in the
hairline because if you're going to do
this area and in the temples you that's
not enough you have to get up here
so I always suggest doing this area
bringing it down you would like your
highlight to be above the brow swoops
down and here in this area so you would
want that bronzer that darker contour to
be under that highlight and above that
highlight to cover it so that your face
looks like a heart and your eyebrow
should be the arches of the heart so if
you imagine it like this everything
inside of that heart should be a light
color everything outside of that heart
could be a dark color that doesn't
necessarily mean that everything in that
area should be dark but that's just kind
of a rule of thumb is use the brows and
everything inside needs to stay light
going down to the corner of the lips you
want to use the eyebrows as the arc
going down right in here this should
remain light and then everything around
it you can contour for now this is very
easy and basic
so we'll do the same thing right here
we'll just drag that along like so and
then I'm going to leave the center of my
forehead light because I personally like
it looking like so I don't like to drag
it down on my forehead I think it can
make you look a little muddy and dirty
like you just kind of threw bronzer on
and it can be overwhelming so I like to
just contour this area right here under
the cheekbone and then of course you can
take your brush pull your hairline back
and then just lightly with nothing
additional on it right now this is just
the brush with anything that could be
left over sweep it in here so that you
don't have any like stark white areas in
between the bronze are here and here
just kind of slide it along just like
that and if you want you can take a
lighter powder at this point and then
you can lighten this area in this area
and that will make your contour even
more intense I'm going to use Mac's
margin because it's just sitting in
front of me so why not I'm going to take
that just put that on the cheeks trying
to see what I'm doing I'm using the
viewfinder I'm gonna take Sigma's f-35
tapered highlighting brush and I'm going
to take the Stila duo hot cheek
highlighter right here
and I'm just going to lightly highlight
the cheekbones oh the contour actually
looks good I was scared that in person
it wouldn't look good because I was
using the viewfinder but it actually
looks nice sweet can take the highlight
and drag it in other areas where we
typically highlight and there you go
alright and of course if you want to
make it more dramatic you can go back
you can deepen it up if you want to make
it more intense than this and this is
not enough for you what you want to do
is dip it back in there and then just
accentuate it right here you just want
to go like this and like this and then
walk away just to give that one extra
line just to give a little pop and then
that will give just a little bit more
dimension in there that is more extreme
that's something that I would definitely
stay away from during the daytime unless
you really want
outlook that's definitely evening time I
look to make that way more intense and
dramatic so you can see literally that
brush makes contouring so easy it is
insane anyone can contour with this
brush all you have to do is just wiggle
it back and forth it's awesome
I will also list the products that I'm
wearing on my face because I know you
guys always have a lot of questions
about stuff so yeah thank you so much
for watching I hope you learned
something and I will see you soon na bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
