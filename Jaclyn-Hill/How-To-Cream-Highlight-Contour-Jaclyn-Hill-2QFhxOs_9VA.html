a cream highlighting and contouring
video if you're wondering the difference
between highlighting and contouring with
creams and liquids as opposed to powders
basically it's just going to give you a
more natural finish I know that seems
crazy since you're sculpting out your
face with super light and dark shades
but it is going to give you more of a
natural settled and look very airbrushed
HD camera ready you see all the
celebrity makeup artists doing this
right now in Hollywood just because it
makes you look just like over the top
beautiful and glamorous everything is
blended as opposed to when you work with
powders sometimes you can get a little
bit choppy it can look a little cakey on
dry skin it can look too glittery and it
might break up a little bit using
liquids and creams as long as you're
applying them correctly is going to
beautiful on everybody so let's just get
started I'm going to put my hair on top
of my head so that it's not in your way
really quick and yes I did diet darker
thanks for noticing it's still red but
it's darker so that's so cute
so this outlet is ugly I'm sorry just
don't look at it so there are a couple
of different ways to do highlighting and
contour with cream products you can do
before your foundation or after I
believe that doing it after your
foundation is the easiest way so that's
what I'm going to show you I already
have applied my hourglass veil liquid
foundation this is the illuminating one
it's very new I think this is my second
or third time using it so far I do like
it and I use my Sigma f80 brush just to
stipple this all over my face so that's
all I have I don't have any concealer
under my eyes all I have is a foundation
stipple on when you're applying your
foundation before you highlight and
contour with cream products make sure
you do not put a heavy amount on I
literally use one full pump and I just
stippled all around my face and that's
enough because you're going to be
putting more products on so you don't
need to do a full coverage amount of
foundation on the face just make sure
you do not apply a powder foundation
because powders can never go before
liquids you have to make sure powder is
the last thing to ever touch your face
if you put a powder first than a liquid
it's going to break up like crazy so
just keep that in mind first products
I'm going to use is this Mac prep and
prime highlighter and show you light
boost this is the yellowy green shade
there are two others bright forecasts
and radiant rose radiant rose is a more
pink color and bright forecast is more a
peach shade for much darker complexions
the reason I'm using light boost which
is more yellowy green is because of my
skin tone I have a
a bit of yellow in it so if I were to
put pink on it would make me look very
washed out and zombie ish now I do use
the pink tone under my eyes because if
you're using yellow on the face and
Foundation's and highlighters you do
want to use the opposite shade under the
eyes typically unless you are an
exception that way it just looks more
natural and balanced out I'm literally
just going to go to town and show you
how to do this I'm going to twist up so
that song comes out and I'm going to
start right here at the bottom and I'm
going to draw a line for my earlobe
pretty much up to my lip area then I'm
going to just put a line right here my
chin and then we want to emphasize the
Cupid's bow so I go in the center up to
the nose and then slightly up there this
will make your top lip look fuller and
I'm going to go around here there's a
lot of times we get shadows in areas
like this in redness so I'm just going
to go in and fill that in and I'm also
going to bring it down here so that this
area doesn't sink away I know I look
crazy
and then we're just going to do like a
little flower in the center of the
forehead and just kind of spiral this
outward and then we're going to touch
right on the top of that brow if you
highlight above here it's a really easy
trick to make that brow look even higher
and more arched if you don't have time
to sculpt out brows or highlight under
your brows you can just put some
highlighter up here like this and it
will immediately bring that brow higher
and right here I just put this on and I
almost draw football laces just to
finish that off and then I take my f80
and I just go ahead and blend this all
in and you can move in any motions you
want circular motions dragging motions
whatever you're comfortable with
when we get up in here make sure you're
working outward from your nose area so
make sure you're blending down and
you're dragging this all along that top
area of the lip because if you notice a
lot of times throughout the day
foundation can cake up on your top lip
area and almost make it look like you
have a semi mustache if that makes sense
in putting that lightness up there we'll
make sure that you don't get like any
dark pigmentation or foundation
gathering up it'll keep it light work
upward and outward letting all this
together then I'm going to go in with
bare mineral
stroke of light this is in shade
aluminous - it is made for highlighting
so it is nice and sheer it's beautiful
it has a little bit of luminosity in it
and I start in the corner of my eye and
I bring it down to the corner of my nose
and then we're going to get thinner like
Stairsteps and we're going to take it
back towards the temple right in that
area so I bring it down towards the nose
and then Sara steps back towards the
temple again then I'm going to take a
sigma tapered kabuki brush this is the
f-86 and I'm going to just blend this
out going downward and then pulling it
backward again just in small strokes now
I'm going to go in with my actual
concealer and since I've already done so
much highlighting I don't have to use
too much of it so I'm using the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer and I am using shade
nw20 and then with my ring finger I'm
just going to take a little bit of it
and I'm going to tap in a corner and
then below it and then on the side just
three dots on each eye and then blend
this out and once again make sure you
blend this all the way back past that
brow and all the way in to the nose area
when you are blending concealer and
right underneath your eye and those fine
lines where concealer always wants to
settle in crease make sure that you
don't just blend in one motion if you're
consistently blending outward like this
your concealer is going to want to set
outward like that so make sure you go
inward and then outward inward and then
outward and that will make it so that
your concealer doesn't just sit there in
your lines
also make sure you tap a lot if you
swipe you're going to just drag it
around and once again it's going to not
only pull at your eye area but it's
going to want to settle in there so make
sure that you tap backward and forward
backward and forward I then take
whatever is left over and I bring it in
towards this area just to meet that
highlighting that we did before right
there I bring it up on the bridge of the
nose and drag it in there so that we
don't have any darkness in this inner
corner so I'm going to be using a Bobbi
Brown Foundation stick to contour with
you can use whatever you have a
drugstore found
that's like four or five shades darker
than you will work just fine but this is
what I've got in my mom's house and it's
new so I want to try it so let's hope
for the best it's in shade caramel it is
about four to five shades darker than my
skin tone so we will see how this works
I'm going to use a sigma ankle kabuki
brush and f80 is the number of it and
I'm going to just make sure that
whatever product you do pick up you get
on the tip of the brush especially and
it really doesn't matter how much you
get because it's going to be harsh no
matter what and you're going to blend it
out so just get it on the tip of that
brush you can see it in there it's
really dark and then I'm going to start
right in that contour line I do have a
contouring video that's like really
in-depth all with powder products I will
link that below but I'm just going to
kind of do this so I'm just going to
push this right in that contour line and
oh this is nice it's actually like not
coming off super super harsh love and
I'm going to just work in this area like
that now you can see that that's
obviously very harsh but I'm going to do
the same thing over here and push it in
that area and you want to push upward
when working with cream products because
you don't want it to drag down unless
you intentionally want to bring it
downward you want everything to be up
and perky so I'm going to do same thing
up here on the forehead I'm going to
just push this color and there and then
over here this is just going to bring in
these areas and make the face look like
it has more shape and definition and I'm
going to touch a little bit right on the
hairline the temples just for more
warmth and get all in my hair yay and
I'm going to take just a little bit
right here on the bottom of my jawline
just to blend everything together I'm
just going to take a paper towel and I'm
just literally wiping off like this so
that there's not tons of that cream
product still on it and then I'm going
to go back and I'm going to work in
circular motions over here you want to
blend the sides down more than the
center if you have a large forehead and
you want to make it look smaller you can
bring this down pretty harshly to make
your forehead look smaller if you don't
have that issue and you
simply want to contour I like to leave
this area kind of blank right in here
and that will look more natural going to
take this Sigma all-over blend brush in
a 37 this is in their perfect blend kit
and I'm going to take more of this right
here and what I'm going to do is just
really sculpt this out with a harsh line
going from the top of the ear right down
like that and it is going to be a pretty
small line but I want it to be more
harsh just so that we can get a little
bit more intense contour once again
wiping at that brush off so you don't
have tons of cream on it I'm just going
to start flicking it upward and back and
forth bringing it forward and up
and then I'm just going to go over it so
that there's no harsh lines and we don't
have like that crazy line anymore you
can see the difference between this side
and how its blended in this side and how
it's much more choppy so that's what
this brush is for so just use that angle
to bring it down try not to go any
higher than like up here you want to
keep it in this lower cheekbone area and
just blend that around so last thing I
do in that step is I just go back with
the f80 that I originally applied
foundation and blend it in my highlight
and I go from the corner of my lip and
then I drag it back to the ear just to
clean up if at all that contour was
being blended downward because I don't
want this area to have contour on it
because that will sculpt out the cheeks
the most so just from the corner of the
lip in a sweeping motion just drag it
back you can even go back with the
highlighter a second time if you want
just in like these areas just to make
sure that you didn't get any of that
liquid bronzer down there because you
don't want this area to be dark at all
or that can happen opposite effects and
make your face look larger so you want
to make sure that this area right here
is nice and light I'm going to take a
tiny bit more of that contour and I'm
going to just bring it underneath my lip
area and I'm going to create a shadow
and lightly buff it downward right there
just being very light handed with this
and if you go like this you'll be able
to see it but if you just have your lips
normally like this
this is a trick to make your bottom lip
look much fuller just like putting the
lightness on the top of your lip will
make your top lip look fuller so
lightness on top darkness on bottom and
if you line your lips and put on
lipstick it will work and you will have
much fuller looking lips now that we are
completely done applying cream products
to the face now is the time to use any
setting or finishing powder of your
choice I always recommend using a powder
to set that under eye concealer though
so that nothing creases or moves or
settles it'll also help keep any
eyeshadow that you choose to apply under
your eye area in place and not settle in
the creamy concealer that we applied so
we are all done now I just went in and
finished the rest of my makeup just
using some I shot
a mascara on the lower lash line I set
my concealer with a little bit of powder
and I use Mac margin blush on my cheeks
so I really hope you guys enjoy this
