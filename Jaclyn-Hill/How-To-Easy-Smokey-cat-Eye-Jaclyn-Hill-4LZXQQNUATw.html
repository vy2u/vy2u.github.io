today was that pretty good I'm kind of
impressed I know it was very strained
right now that is because I just have on
a full face of foundation bronzer and
brows and then gloss and I used powder
to set my face like the power to alter
my eyelashes my eyelashes look Lana I
know I look very strange but that's okay
because for today's video I'm going to
be showing you basically how to achieve
like the easiest smokey eye ever you
have to use the exact same products as
me but this only requires basically two
brushes and one eyeshadow palette it is
so easy and a technique itself is super
easy if you follow along like I swear
you can do this going to zoom you in
nice and tight nice and right and tight
okay we're going to get a pop in I felt
like the beginning of a plural for today
then look I'm going to be using the
morphe 25/8 palette looks alike indeed
to the in focus the focus of these herbs
comes with a bunch of shimmer and mask
for today's look I'm gonna be using it
as you Matt Browns and the matte black
then the two brushes that I'm going to
mainly be using on my lid are my ride or
died recently this one right here I have
been using for years and years and this
is the more p.m. 4-3-3 you have the Mac
217 it's like basically the same thing
and then this one right here is the
morphe 5:06 I have recently fallen in
love with I mentioned it in a tutorial a
couple videos ago and I have not put it
down since like it is just the best
brush for like precision living you'll
see you'll see as I do this video that
is a zoom like that is those using my
smile line Hey okay so I'm going to
start off with the end four three three
by Morpheus is the fluffy and natural
hair so this is going to apply whatever
product you pick up any much more sheer
wash effect if you go in with a
synthetic hair which looks like this
which will be black physically that's
going to apply more generous amount of
product so that's how we're going to
start off with a natural hair synthetic
brush because it's going to apply the
least amount of product and I'm going to
start off by going into my crease area
so I'm going to pick up I know this is
crazy if I usually pick up all three of
you shade so didn't really matter just
pick one pick the Adhan
you can go with all three but these
three mil shades right here like my
favorites because they're very similar
we add
at the same time so I've got to take my
brushes now and I almost all of them but
any like medium tone and neutral brown
will do the trick for this look so I'm
going to take that initially place my
brush right on the outer corner of the
eye right here and I'm going to just
begin to put that in the crease area for
this book we're going to kind of create
like a cat eye essentially so I don't
want to put a ton of products on the
inner corner of the eye I'm going to
leave that pretty nude and bowling I
want basically everything to be on the
outer corner we're starting here as you
can see I'm not starting as high as
normal normally I start like all up in
here my crease and I start like a longer
hair brush not today I'm going to keep
it nice and low because I don't want
this I look to go up too high like
towards the brow when I keep it kind of
down here a little bit and then I just
always make sure that everything is
blended every step of the way before I
move on to another color or another
brush is make sure that everything is
smooth because actually you really
achieve a flawless looking eye is just
to blend every single step as you go
alright so now I'm going to do is I'm
going to grab some translucent powder
and this is the RCM a no color
translucent powder even though I keep it
in a Sephora package and then I'm going
to pick up this brush you guys I cannot
live without this brush and it's again
from morphe and if the e47 looks alike
as this oh my gosh what I do is I take
this I stamp it into my translucent
powder any translucent powder will do
tap off the excess and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create the shape that
I want to have on my eyeshadow if you
want to have a really intense like cut a
shadow you can do that you can make
whatever shape you want I'm going to
start trying to make sure I'm in camera
I'm going to start right here at the
corner and I'm going to just stamp it
right back like that and it's just a
small observation as you can see I did
not take that kind of the powder and
touch it all the way like to my actual
lower lash lines you see that how it's
not actually touching right here in this
session the reason that I need that
blank is because at one point after we
get done with the upper lid I'm going to
take this brush I'm going to go down in
this area and I don't want that
transmissive powder to get in the way so
it's not actually touching my actual
what I live
lashline if that makes sense this trick
is just something that I came up with
and created one day when I was doing my
makeup because I loved that like kind of
that like smoked out cat eye but I know
my strengths and I know my weaknesses
it's just something I cannot achieve on
my own so I just created this technique
to make it easier for myself and I'm
telling you it is like smokey cat eye
for dummies all right so I'm going to
pick up this brown right here on that
small precision brush now and I'm going
to begin to take this right along I'm so
crookedly the camera needs like come
over to me that's better so I'm going to
take this and begin to create eight like
that dark brown smokiness and I want to
keep this like a low down at the lash
line and then slowly bringing it upward
I'm actually going to take some
translucent powder really click on
complete Wonder and I'm just going to
put this underneath here just in case I
get really messy with my eye shadow and
how like a ton of Fallout I can just
sweep it away in one quick swoop and it
will be totally gone alright so you're
just sticking right there on that
lashline and we're going to get that
lash line nice and dark just on the
outer corners going back and forth back
and forth as you can see and then I'm
going to just slowly kind of flick it
out towards that transit set powder that
I have there just working in nice and
slow motions you can see I'm slightly
creating a little line nothing intense
or scary I'm going to go back in with
the original brush and I'm going to just
go right over top of that there's
nothing on that brush right now at all
totally naked I'm just going over all
that I'm going to pick up a little bit
more of the original color that I went
in with in the lower crease I'm just
going to use that to the right or top of
the situation now I'm going to repeat
the same steps on the other eye apply
blend repeat so the trick when you begin
to like swoop out this dark shadow it's
not have too much on your brush like you
don't want to go in and touch the
product and have fresh shadow on there
and then start scooping out because it
we'll get messy very very quickly
because you'll have too much product you
want to go in which is a little bit of
product on that rush and begin to sweep
that work again I'm going to grab this
brush go over the entire sting to blend
it out as you can see I'm leaving it in
a corner like literally blank completely
blank but I love the way it looks
without putting like a matte shadow or
anything because it just gives it like a
sultry kind of sexy natural looking you
know what I mean when I say naturally
obviously the smoky eye doesn't look
like a raw bed but it just gives it more
like a runway smokey eye and ever notice
how when you look at like models and
magazines involved that their smokey
eyes are rarely perfect but they kind of
have like a grungy more just like thrown
on look that's kind of the but I'm going
for with this makeup look ok so now
we're going to go in with the black
right here with matte black at the very
bottom the venom focus there we go that
matte black right there on the exact
same small synthetic brush that we've
been working with the entire time and
I'm going to just put it right here in
the outer corner only I am NOT going to
bring this in relief are not going to
bring it up too high so I keep this nice
and low because the Saline is actually
gonna open up our eyes believe it or not
because when you do a smoky eye
sometimes you can get like that close
eye of X but when you put black on the
outer lash line on the upper and lower
lash it's going to give you that more
like open all into factor that makes
sense I'm going to take your eyes from
this like this so let's make that outer
part like full pop open and then just
really lightly as course answers
basically no product left on that brush
flick it out just like that
okay so now I have the black on there
I'm going to go over again with the
exact same original brush blend
everything out there's nothing on this
brush again it still is totally bare
just going over everything and what I
love about the smoky eye is even though
we have all of the edges blended there
so think about that looks slightly and
messy and I just like it because it just
gives like a sexy sultry vibe oh the
magic of translucent powder hi now you
can see after I wiped away at that
transition powder my lower lashline do
you see how I have some darkness down
there that is because when I originally
went in with this brush I didn't put it
on the actual lower lash line like I was
saying earlier I put it right underneath
and stamped up because now I have this
like natural connect it happens right
there between the lower and the upper
I'm going to go in and define that even
more the non magic best neighbor has
been working with the whole time I just
kind of wiped it off a little bit on a
paper towel I'm going to be honest I use
my sweat pants but it's always fine and
I'm going to grab any of these products
are any of these shadows right here in
the center and I'm going to begin to
blend those out on the lower lash line
so I'm going to start on the outer
corner because that's where I want the
most emphasis to be on the lower lash
line
and I'm going to just connect the lower
lash line to the upper as you can see it
basically already is uses how I apply
the transit sent out or in the first
place I'm just going to begin to cut
next time next connect that even more
and then whatever is left on the brush
I'll just kind of lightly bring it into
the inner corner but not too much
because I want that inner corner I'd be
pretty blank now something I will do if
I want this to be really structured I'll
kind of just go ham in here and then
I'll go back with this brush a second
time I don't always do this but
sometimes I will to just really clean
all of that up and make it look super
duper connected this is not necessary
but if you just want to be like a crazy
perfectionist which I usually am I will
do this and then I'm going to go in with
a more be gel liner I swear to God to do
is not sponsored by morphe at this
moment I'm just not really like I think
that every single product that I use
so far has been from more people that's
not true my transition powder but Google
one lifted their gel liner and shade the
latest is their black one it's very very
black and very very creamy so I'm gonna
take that on a small liner brush and I'm
going to apply it on my inner waterline
you can use just a regular cool liner
that's what I've always throw in the
past but recently I've just done this I
don't know why it just seems to be
really really fast and really really
black and it doesn't fade so I'm taking
that same brush as a liner leftover on
it and I'm going to just kind of on the
outer corner of the lower lash line only
I'm going to kind of smudge it down it's
a little bit kind of like pressing it
down into that lash line because I want
it to be like way darker and blacker on
the outer part of the eye minute grab is
like a definer brush like this it's the
morphe 4 3 2 oh my god like I don't have
any other brand here I have a sigma one
this is the easiest teen it's the same
one but that's my concealer brush I use
for my brows I'm going to go a little
bit more of that black and I am going to
just only on the outer portion of the
eye I am NOT going to drag it in far the
center of my eye I'm just keeping it all
right there on the outer portion I'm
going to just shimmy that brushes back
and forth just to darken and smoke out
them black I'm going to that same thing
on the upper lash line as well as right
here on the outer edge I'm just going to
take that brush and just really get that
outer corner nice and black just because
ok let's just remove any extra princesa
powder that we have I'm going to be
using the l'oreal voluminous carbon
black mascara my men will just stab
myself in the eye and I'm going to do
just one thin coat I am going to be
applying a false eyelashes it is not
necessary but it's a look you can just
go ahead give your lashes a curl and
apply a coat of mascara and that was
definitely suffice but you know me I'm
going to be applying any intoxicating
lashes by flutter looks like this right
here about the other one in my hand
right now they are just so what's
dramatic while be like with the fluffy
sexy kind of spiky I just I love this so
I cut mean lashes way more on the end
and I normally want to go typically
leads in the longer
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
put it more on the outer part of my eye
so that it really helped emphasize I
just kind of cat I draw it we have going
on on the outer quarter
now it's going to fly some mascara to my
lower lashes really quick and I'm going
to use the Marc Jacobs Omega lash so
that completes and this'll look I just
went in and added some highlight cool
it's got to be champagne popping I just
love it it looks so much there's
something about it because of the fact
that it's not just like so seamless that
that makes sense and like there's no
brow bone highlight it just it gives
kind of a natural more like exotic kind
of sexy vibe I hope that I didn't
overwhelm you guys in the tutorial
explaining everything because I wanted
to really break it down and give you
every single little detail for those of
you following along
so hopefully that wasn't overwhelming
but honestly I have been doing smokey
eyes at least attempting to do smokey
eyes for over ten years now and this is
the easiest smokey eye that I've ever
come across
there's just foolproof is so easy to do
there's never been a time that I've
applied it and been like oh crap it
looks terrible when you start over like
it's just it's easy once you get the
hang of it so buff out that translucent
powder go ahead and give a shot let me
know if you guys like the techniques
because I am obsessed with it I use it
constantly now to clean up my smoky eyes
and just even like not even my Sofia if
I just clean up my regular eye shadow
