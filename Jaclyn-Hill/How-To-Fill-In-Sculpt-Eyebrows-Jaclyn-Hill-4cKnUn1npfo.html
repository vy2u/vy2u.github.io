showing you how I fill in my eyebrows
which is why they are not filled in
right now I am rocking the own natural
look yeah so natural I will of course be
giving you tips and tricks to use along
the way so I really hope you enjoy let's
get started so the first thing I use is
the Anastasia brow Wiz it's just a brow
pencil it looks like this it has two
sides one has a spoolie brush to comb
through the brows and then one has the
actual pencil
I love these pencils because as you can
see they are so thin on the top so you
can really get precise when you are
applying it but at the same time it's
not breakable it's nice and tough and
dense so you're not like doing this and
it doesn't just like crumble off like
some other brow pencils do first thing I
do is I take the spoolie and I just run
it through my brow just to shape it how
I'm going to want it shaped so you don't
want to like run it downward like this
when you're shaping it you want to make
sure that you have it in the position
that you're going to want to follow
along I always suggest starting at the
tail of the brow not the inner corner
because then sometimes you can look a
little too harsh you can get too much
product in here so I always start out
here in this area so I'm just going to
lay my pencil down right here and I'm
just going to begin and I'm going it to
just drag this out right there because
my brow tends to flip up right here at
the end it tends to kind of do that
so I mark out where I want it to lay and
then that's what the brow gel is for
when I use that at the end it will just
keep that flat to my face and then I'm
going to just sculpt this whole area out
at first all I'm going to do is just
stay at the bottom of the brow I'm not
actually technically filling in yet I'm
just staying along the bottom portion
right here now once I get to this area
right here I'm actually going to stop
filling in I'm not going to put any
product whatsoever in this entire area
right here for a natural brow I stopped
right here and I use more of a heavy
hand out here and more of a lighter hand
in this area so this is like super super
light and then this I get much more
dense and darker so then in this area I
will begin to just fill this area in so
now you're going to just create that
arch by slowly but densely going over
this
area I personally never want my natural
hairs peeking out and over my brow
pencil so I like to go all the way in
this area and fill this whole situation
in then just spool it out when you're
using the spoolie make sure that you're
not like taking it and running it across
your forehead because it will take that
product and just drag it across your
face so now you can see I saw this pact
right here so I'm just going to lightly
fill this area in as well and I'm going
super light since I'm getting more
towards the inner brow the more you are
in this area the darker you can be the
more in this area I like to go lighter
just because it'll give you a softer
more natural look and you won't look as
mean or harsh so now that I have filled
in this whole area of my brow I'm then
going to take my sleet and just go in
this area lightly you don't want to go
below the natural hair or above just in
that area and just kind of spread it
around and it will spread it even if you
feel like it's not I promise it will
spread that pencil around now I'm going
to do the exact same steps to the other
brow but just remember your brows are
sisters but they are not twins it is
basically impossible to get any two
brows to look the exact same so follow
the same steps but don't get frustrated
they're not identical you can blend that
out and shape them how you meet to this
brow right here is much thinner in this
area then this brow is so I typically
have to drag my pencil down a little bit
more in this area then I do over here
this one I follow my natural hair this
one I kind of fake it and I drag it down
just a tiny bit below right in that area
and literally just doing that step makes
a difference if I don't do that when I
get done doing my brows it really does
look like botch Botox and as you can see
this brows a little bit sharper then
this one is more round so I will be
conscious of that and just kind of put a
little bit more product there just to
slightly around that area out to help it
match up a little bit with this one then
I will go in and fill in the area and
the tail and then sometimes to make this
part easier carving out the top you can
take your brows and slightly push them
down
just to see where that hair growth is
and if you see where that hair growth is
you can kind of line that up perfectly
and go right over the root of the hair
so this is how I would wear my brow on a
day-to-day basis where you know I'm not
doing anything really over-the-top no
super smoky eye
nothing really dramatic all I do is
literally just fill in the outer tail
with the Anastasia brow Wiz in the shade
soft brown and then blend it all
together with a spoolie and that's it
but I am going to now show you how to
step it up and really carve them out and
make it even more dramatic so now I am
going to go in with another Anastasia
brow Wiz and this is in the shade ash
blonde so this is a couple shades
lighter I'm going to use this to fill in
the inner corner of my brow now and this
is going to give it kind of an ombre
effect but it'll make it look really
natural and it's really easy so this I
will bring all the way to that inner
hair and just drag it straight back to
meet up with that soft Brown you really
want to make sure that you carve out
this bottom area right and here the
entire time you want this to be the
sharpest area of the brow the very
bottom of it to make it look the most
defined once I have a lightly just made
a line in the bottom of the brow then I
will slowly and so lightly just flick it
upward not all the way upward to the top
of my brow just a tiny tiny bit I'm
barely putting any pressure if you can
see not much product is being placed on
the skin so now that I have that I will
go back with soft brown and I will begin
to fill this part and even more
dramatically and now I'm going to press
down a little bit harder on this side of
my brows go straight up naturally this
side they go in naturally so I do take
my pencil and I do make a line that goes
right here past my brow just to make
that look more like this one and then I
will sculpt that out in a minute and
I'll show you how I make that look more
natural
so now that we have filled in our entire
browse the inner corner with ash blonde
and then the outer corner with soft
brown and pretty much we're going super
light handed with ash blonde right here
and then we meet ash blonde and soft
brown right here in the center and then
we continue to go light handed with soft
brown and then we go much more
heavy-handed out here to make it the
darkest so you want it to be light
medium dark on the brow that is what's
going to look the most natural so now
I'm going to take any concealer I'm
taking the mac prolongwear concealer
this is shade nw20 you do want this
shade to be a little bit lighter than
your skin and I'm going to take the flat
definer brush by Sigma this is the e15
it has the gold ferrule on it because it
is from the Extravaganza collection so
with a little bit on the back of my hand
I am just going to rub that on the brush
on both sides and then with the excess
just kind of wipe that off we don't want
it to have tons of products like right
there is good so then I'm literally just
going to sculpt out my brow you won't
think this is going to make a huge
difference but it really really will so
starting in the inner corner with this
brush I'm just going to press it right
underneath my natural hairs and drag it
with whatever is left over on my brush I
just kind of lightly shimmy downward to
blend that into the eyeshadow area that
way you don't have a super super harsh
line right there in the inner corner
then we're going to do the exact same
thing on top so we're going to hold the
brush above our eye and we're going to
just from right here I do not press it
up against the brow like I do on the
bottom half I'm going to just slowly
bring it down towards that brow and then
what is left on your brush is what
you'll use to sculpt this area out so
then with the product on there I'm just
going to lightly drag it along right
above that brow get it as close as
possible this is really great for if you
make any mistakes on your brows you go
up to high it with that pencil you can
literally go in and just erase it if you
want to really sculpt the tail of your
brow out you can you can get in there
really precisely and drag it along I
usually do my brows right after my
foundation before I do any of my powders
or any of my blushes or contour that way
I can be a little bit more messy with
this but since I have powder products on
my cheeks right now it's going to tend
to look a little yucky so I'm trying to
be really careful so I'm just going to
grab it right there under the natural
hair and right here
I don't go up underneath my natural
hairs like I do on this one because this
brow has more of a gradual slant
naturally this one kind of like goes up
or naturally so because of that I make a
straight line as an illusion and leave a
very small area in here without the
concealer just to make it look a little
bit more even I'm going to start right
here on this outer tail and sculpt this
out
once again though you just want to run
this right above the hair like that and
just make that line and I'm bringing it
down a little bit more I'm erasing a
little bit of what I did because I'm
seeing that I didn't want it as high up
so do you see now how this one is
rounded and this one is more angular it
always always happens to me so I have to
go in and round this one out this brow
just wants to be sharper and harsher
than that one for some reason this is my
easy brow this one I have more
difficulties with it I will go in
underneath and just kind of around it in
this area and bring a little bit more
product down I'm using soft Brown around
it in this area and there it already
looks much rounder and I'll just go in
that rounding circular motion and so you
can see in this area that is a total a
lie
there is no hair right in here I just
filled that in just to make it look more
like this one but you really can't tell
with the techniques that we're using so
then just to finish everything I do go
in with the anastacio clear brow gel
this is the best brow gel I've ever used
in my entire life it's seriously like
glue I start on the outer corner because
when you put it on it really really
works and it does not let your brows
move and it dries almost like a
crustiness which I like because my brows
won't go anywhere so I always start on
the outer tail it doesn't really matter
if the outer tail is crusty at all and
then I get it directly on that area so
that those hairs don't flop around or
flick up or anything and then whatever
is left over I go in the inner corner
and I just flatten that area out and I
actually like the way the brow gel makes
my brow look you can see this one has
more movement in it where this one looks
more like it's just been done almost
like it's just powdery but this one
there's much more movement and it's like
you can see the individual hairs and I
think that looks much better with the
brow gel in it on days where I'm barely
wearing any makeup whatsoever and I'm
literally throwing on some quick mascara
running out the door I will
use a clear brow gel on just my regular
brows because even just doing that is
better than nothing and it will spruce
you up a little bit so now we are
completely done filling in our brows now
is the time to go around and tween any
additional hairs that you have in these
areas since the brows are completely
filled in the way you desire them any
hairs that you see are obviously going
to be unwanted hairs that is how I keep
my brows maintained every single time I
fill in my brows I grab one or two
little stray hairs and just tweeze them
away that way I never really have to
have like this big day where I sit down
I'm like oh my gosh my brows are a
disaster
I do take care of them myself I don't
get them threaded or wax I just filled
them in like this and then I go through
and I just tweeze unwanted hairs um two
years ago my brows were a disaster they
were a hot mess oh my gosh I had like 15
hairs on my brows and I just used to
make this exact shape and then tweeze
around it and then wash it all off and I
know that sounds kind of crazy but
that's how I got them to grow into the
shape is just one day at a time so I
really hope you guys enjoy this video
hopefully you learn a little something I
will have all of the information for
every products I use and everything
happening on my face and my hair in the
description bar down below so I love you
and I'll talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
