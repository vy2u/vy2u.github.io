right now with my like full-on curly sue
fluffy frizzy hair and a sweatshirt with
hoops but I'm actually running out the
door and I have to get going right now
there wasn't gonna be late but I wanted
to sit down and film this video for you
guys first because I I filmed the video
a week and a half ago when I sat down to
actually edit it yesterday and upload
over half of the footage was completely
and totally blurry so this time I was
staring at my monitor oh my god my hair
is so frizzy today oh stay on my monitor
obsessively the entire time just like
making sure so that that doesn't happen
again
oh yeah so for today's video I'm gonna
be showing you this does my go to glam
when you wanna fool people that you took
a lot of time on your makeup I got some
tips and tricks for y'all today and I
can do this in 20 minutes and the reason
why I know that is because I have timed
myself now I did not time myself today I
didn't start my stopwatch on my phone or
anything because obviously I'm like
talking as I'm going so it's not gonna
be like the same genuine thing where I
just sit down by myself and do my makeup
without any distractions I hope you guys
enjoy this video if you do make sure to
subscribe and give it a thumbs up I love
you and I hope you enjoy and reality
sinks in hello so the first thing I'm
gonna do is something I've never done on
camera before but this is just a little
tip I've actually talked about this so
you know how when you look at me right
now I have absolutely no makeup not a
stitch and my eye just kind of looks
lost
and I definitely some liner I definitely
some mascara I need something to bring
my eyes back to life because right now I
think I just look like but I'm not gonna
have time for liner today because I'm
gonna be getting ready very quickly so
what I will do is in the morning before
I wash my face I know this is crazy I'm
gonna show you guys right here because
if I forget to do it in the morning I
can do it now and it works just the same
but it's easiest if you do this in the
morning when you know that you have to
get ready quick that day you do before
you wash your face okay so I was gonna
take a regular cold liner and I'm going
to just salah polly line and kind of
tight line my eyes like it can be a
sloppy as you want just get this in
there like so and then I'm doing the
same thing to my lower lash line as well
just getting right in there and tight
lining it very sloppy I cannot believe
that I used to literally wear eyeliner
like this like not this sloppy but I
would literally just line my eyes and
I'll tell you 13 years old just like the
same be like I'm good to go
I'm gonna grab a makeup removing wipe
right here or you can use some eye cream
on a q-tip and I'm literally just going
to wipe that away gently of course we're
not gonna be red with our eye area but
I'm gonna wipe that off and what's gonna
be left over is just the tight line and
then it's gonna bring more attention to
our eyes so see what it looks like when
it's wiped away it's much more normal
than this situation okay so there is the
lazy girl hack to getting really really
fast eyeliner it kind of looks like when
you wear a really really dark smoky eye
and then you wash your face you go to
bed you had that leftover residue and
you don't clean it up in the next
morning you wake up and it looks
something like this
that's kind of the situation now
obviously this is not makeup artistry
this is a literally just a lazy girl
hack that's all it is
I would recommend going and actually
taking the time to tightline your eyes
but if you don't have the time on a day
like today where I'm rushing this is a
second option okay I'm gonna go ahead
and prime my face so we can actually get
started I'm gonna go in with my go-to
foundations as I always do starting off
at the hourglass vanish the stick
foundation I'm going to make a couple
lines on my face and then I'm gonna grab
my Dior forever foundation and do a
pinch of that as well I'm gonna be going
in with a full coverage foundation today
now obviously you can do whatever your
favorite foundation is if you prefer
more sheer coverage of people for it
into more per four if you prefer
attention oyster Iser whatever you're
comfortable with obviously the less
product you use the faster it's going to
take you to get ready but I am a full
coverage girl and especially right now
my skin is not happy with me it is that
time of the month and on top of that I
have been going through a lot of stuff
in my personal life recently and very
stressed out so my skin is red and
blotchy and I'm definitely breaking out
so I'm gonna stick to my full coverage
your teen so I put a couple pumps I
don't know why eyes like with a sign a
couple pumps a couple pumps Oh doer
forever on the back of my hand right
here and I'm gonna go in with a damp
beauty sponge and just begin to buff
this all together and press it into the
skin as a my normal foundation routine
right now we're just sticking to
everything normally
I am going to attempt to try not to
cover up my eyebrows too much with
foundation typically I'm just like very
unaware of my eyebrow and I just slap
foundation all over the place
but to make today faster and easier I'm
going to try to avoid my eyebrows that
way I don't have to fill them in as much
and it just saves time I'm gonna take my
concealer I'm gonna put it underneath my
eyes as always and just kind of wrap it
around my nose to cover up any redness
dark circles and discoloration nice
knowing your dark circles I'm gonna take
that concealer and lightly put it over
my eyelid I'm not gonna put too much
concealer on my eyelid because I want
you to still slightly be able to see in
the veins in my eyes which sounds kind
of gross right but that is the thing
that will give away like a full mask of
makeup obviously it's obvious that I
have a lot of makeup on but still if you
can let like some of the natural colors
of your eyelid come out it will make it
look like you are not wearing as much
makeup in a cake face as you really are
okay so now I'm gonna go in with powders
anytime I do a full coverage foundation
I absolutely have to use powders because
it really is the thing that's gonna make
everything like very smooth even and
flawless looking I never end my face
with just creams because I feel like it
really kind of like gets cakey or
throughout the day so we're really light
wash of powder is definitely gonna make
everything just like ah in my opinion so
I'm gonna grab the Kat Von D shade +
light contour palette I'm gonna take
that first lightest shade right there
and I'm also going to be mixing that
because I am so fair right now with the
Mac Pro emphasized shaping powder which
you can get at MAC Cosmetics calm or Mac
Pro stores I'm gonna mix those two
together on my damn Beauty sponge I was
gonna like tap it in there and then do
the same thing and tap it into the
emphasized and then I was going to tap
that right underneath of my eye and I'm
not using too much of it because I do
not want this to get like cakey looking
it's better to not put enough powder and
have to go in and apply more later than
to initially go in with too much and
then now you got cake face and you got
to figure out how to fix that I'm going
to also lightly tap that on the lid as
well okay so now for the rest of the
face I'm gonna go in with my Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush powder and I'm also
gonna go in with the Lancome absolute
powder and just like I did on
oh just like it did on the under eye I'm
going to mix these two powders together
and set my face I think it's time to get
a new powder it's approaching that point
and then I'm just going to really
lightly press both of these powders
together into the skin
okay so now for the brows I'm going to
keep it very simple I'm gonna do today
is fill in what I am naturally missing
hairs I'm not gonna try to reshape my
brows give myself a whole new look I'm
just gonna go in in the areas where it
actually needs the color I always hit
the arch and the tail just slightly that
way we have a little bit more definition
on here just cuz I don't like the way
the tail of my brow looks without
nothing okay so not to warm up the face
I'm going to be going in with a bronzer
I'm not gonna be contouring because
nobody got time for that today so I'm
gonna go in with them make up forever
profusion bronzer I'm using the shade
10m because I'm really fair right now so
this is a really light shade and I'm
gonna be using the morphe M 500 to
bronze today and the reason why is
because it is such a long hair and it's
gonna make it look really natural as a
posts like a really intense like thick
layer of bronzer I just want to kind of
warm up the face and give a little
definition without going ham sandwich in
this bitch okay so now for blush I'm
gonna grab Mac Melba this is one of my
oldest most favoritest blushes yes as in
favoritest it is truly like the perfect
amount of peachy and pink I'm obsessed
with the shade I'm gonna be applying my
blush today with a fan brush which I
know is kind of weird but I actually
learned this tip from Nicole who was
known as lipstick NIC I actually had the
pleasure being her model when she did
her master class here in Orlando Florida
I had to think I was like where was she
in Orlando Florida I was her model that
day and I learned a few things as she
was talking and teaching the class I was
like yes and she applied my blush with
this brush right here so any fan brush
I'm sure will do but this is the morphe
m3 ten in case you're curious and she
was saying threes and wise because she
thinks it just applies it's so natural
and beautifully and it's hard to go
overboard and I was kind of like oh and
then I went home
trying to myself and now for the past
week it's the only way that I've been
applying my blush because it just looks
so beautiful and I would highly
recommend lipstick next class by the way
it was really awesome so just like
quaint everyone gets to ask questions
and you learn a lot I'm gonna add just a
little bit of that makeup for ever
bronzer to the sides of my nose I'm not
gonna really be able to contour much
Shea because this is a quick makeup look
I don't have time to do
that if I gotta get out the door but I
am it's gonna add a little bit of warmth
just to bring some of that color to the
center of the face a little
something-something I'm gonna take that
same bronzer I'm gonna put it right
there in the crease of my eye and that's
actually the only thing I'm gonna put on
my lid today no shadow I'm just gonna
bring in that natural color it's all
over the rest of the face just to kind
of tie everything together as a whole
now this part is totally optional
I wear this look all the time like this
with mascara and a lip and that's it
but I am gonna throw on some false
lashes today this is a very very quick
step for me personally but I know it
does take everybody a while to get the
hang of it so if you are in the phase
where you are not comfortable just
throwing on eyelashes and it takes you
you know a while then skip this because
it's not necessary I'm gonna be going in
with my newest pair of favorite lashes
and they are by velour and they are in
the style here to slay which is so cute
and they actually wrote me a letter and
said that they created these for me
because they see my lash style and they
wanted to create something that I would
love which is so cool and they sent me a
huge box of all of them and I was like
God like that's so crazy like you know
how when you find a perfect pair of
lashes that you love and you're like
they created these for me that's how I
feel about these cuz I love them so much
but they actually did read me wow my
other lash has the glue on it drying I'm
going to put some clear brow gel on
because I cannot leave the house without
clear brow gel I know it's too minor
thing but it's so important to me I am
also going to just slightly remove with
a damp q-tip that liner on the inner
waterline that way the liner is only
tight lined and I'll make my eyes look
bigger as opposed to closing them
you got a multitask if you're trying to
get ready quick that's the thing that I
have learned as your lash glue is dry
and you can do your brows you can do
your liner you can do something else you
can always find something else to do
while you're waiting on your lash glue
put that on a t-shirt mmm okay so now
I'm gonna put some mascara on my lower
lip and now that I messily have mascara
all over my bottom lashes I'm going to
actually do my top lashes as well
but the trick is to keep the mascara
only at the root in the base of the
false lashes just so you are coating
your natural and kind of marrying the
natural to the false lashes and what I
love about this pair of lashes is
whenever I get to the outer corner I
always put some mascara on the outer
corner of these because it just makes
them look so just like I don't even know
like wispy you just kind of frisky and
I'm all about it I'm just gonna pop a
little bit of highlight on the inner
corner of my eye I'm gonna go in with my
palette and use the first shade which is
in light right here I know Georgie
so for today's highlight I'm gonna be
trying the Anastasia and uh Maurizio
highlight which I am super super excited
to try because I got this in the mail a
couple days ago and I haven't even I
haven't done anything I haven't swatched
it nothing some really insane in it it
legit looks like a wet glistening
highlight wave like it's so pretty oh
yes I wonder if this is gonna be too
golden for my skin tone right now cuz I
am fair you guys like I am white right
now like very pale I'm gonna highlight
with a brush first and then I'm gonna
going to use my Beauty sponge because
that is my favorite way to highlight
recently I just want to see like the
first initial swatch and see if it's
gonna be the right color for my skin oh
yeah this will definitely work oh and of
course I have texture right here right
now wearing it to highlight thank you
I'm gonna take my Beauty sponge now and
we're gonna just dab that in there I'm
gonna highlight this way well this is so
pretty
ahh that is gorgeous so last but not
least is the lip color and I'm gonna go
in with a bold lip today I'm gonna be
using more feed liquid lipstick in the
shade hotshot this is one of my go-to
bold the colors if not my number one
favorite and then I'm just going to of
course set my face so that is it you
guys to glam to give a damn but done
quickly but as you guys could see this
really was an easy tutorial the only
thing that might require skill in this
is applying the false lashes but again
you do not need false lashes to achieve
this look I already this look personally
probably two times a week and I don't
put false lashes on you guys seen you on
snapchat a lot and I'm wearing this with
no lashes because it's really not
required but of course if you're skilled
at if you're quick at it and if you just
wanna take it up a notch lashes are
always going to do that for you keep in
mind when I am getting ready and I don't
have a lot of time is lipstick lashes
and highlight I feel like those three
key components you can turn your face
around turn your day around turn your
life around even if you just spot
conceal your face and just still do
lashes highlight and lipstick you're
good to go
or just highlight and lipstick
put on some big sunglasses you're good
to go like those three things are the
main things to me other than evening out
my skin and my foundation of my powder
those three things are the most
important to me I hope that you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching I love you and I'll see my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
