I have made a video and I am so sorry if
you don't know I have posted a couple
things on my Instagram if you don't
follow me on Instagram um I am working
in MAC Cosmetics again and I just
started about two weeks ago so that is
why I have not been up on my video
making recently because I have been
working a lot and normally I work all
day long and when I get home
the Sun is barely peeking out or it's 10
o'clock at night pitch black or whatever
it may be
it has just been really hard to try to
find time to film a video I'm still
sticking with the videos I promise today
is gonna be a highlighting contouring
video but before I start showing you how
i have it in contour myself and my
clients i jus just want to mention a
couple of things first of all the video
that I made that I ended up deleting um
that was Tom talking about me closing
down my channel that is no more I am NOT
closing down this channel this channel
is staying where it is that is not
happening so you don't have to worry
about going and subscribing anywhere
else oh it's a false alarm and I'm very
sorry for the inconvenience for those of
you who did follow me over there and
subscribe thank you so much I love you I
know you've got my back but we can just
stay here and keep simple down um okay
so I watched the video let's get started
and talk about highlighting and
contouring so highlighting we are going
to make something pop out towards you by
contouring we're going to suck something
back away from you that's it very simple
so first of all and in the contour is
where I'm there start you need to make
sure that you have a contour color that
is good for your skin normally one
three are going to work for you and
they're all by Mac obviously there's
many other ones in the world I know NYX
has some really good bronzers and
they're really cheap but one of these
three normally work when people come
into the store unless you are extremely
fair and I can show you a fourth one um
for contouring though the mineralized
skinfinish is on my absolute favorite by
Mac to contour with because they are
mineral and they are so smooth and
they're they're just great they just
apply like butter I think I say the word
butter and every single tutorial okay
the first one is max give me Sun and it
is like it orange you see that right
there by the way ladies when you see
that little ring right there that means
that you've hit pan that as hard as a
rock
so a lot of people will come in and be
like my bronzer dried up it's not
working anymore they make it the same
color as this because it's baked but
yeah that that is pan so my bronzer is
only like right here on the edges but
give me Sun that is a great color for
like my area of skin tone in between the
NC 30 and NC 40 that's a really nice one
give me Sun then this one is dark this
is just a powder for the face the
mineralized skinfinish powder in the
shade dark that is what a lot of women
come in and they're like I don't know a
bronzer or what color to use for my
contour area and they get overwhelmed by
all the shades of bronzers and I
understand so I'll just ask them you
know what's your favorite powder that
you use and then we'll go to that powder
and we'll find it in like two or three
shades darker and there's your contour
color so yes
dark and give me Sun are going awesome
and then that bronze matte bronze is an
awesome it's just matte and it's a
bronzer and this one has more red in it
where these have more orangey yellow
tones in it so just depending what what
you feel okay I prefer the orangey tones
and now no one wants their bronzers to
be orange but the red ones can look
muddy on my skin also you can just get
medium dark which is just lighter than
the dark it's two shades lighter I
believe medium dark medium deep no
there's yes two shades lighter and again
if you're really fair that color would
suit you it's just the power
it's not technically bronze so now you
can use whatever brush you want um a lot
of brushes that I use or discontinued
now a lot of people like the 109 because
you can really carve out your face I
don't like this this I don't think that
it blends really smoothly and I hate how
much the 109 sheds by Mac um so I don't
really like that brush I do like the 139
in the 116 I think this is really nice
for contouring but this has highlighter
shade on it so I'm not going to dip in
my bronzer so I am going to use the
Sigma angled kabuki brush which is like
my absolute favorite for contouring it's
amazing so I'm gonna take I'll take dark
normally I would take give me Sun I'm
going to take darks I want you guys to
really see what I'm doing and I'll do it
a little bit more dramatic so you
understand the drill so in contouring
and highlighting and blush you always
want to start with contour you want to
work from the bottom and then build
whatever you want from there so first of
all I'm gonna take my brush and I'm just
going to go in there and I'm gonna get a
pretty generous amount but I am NOT
gonna go in with all of this on my brush
so you can see it's really on there but
then after that I'm gonna just tap it so
there's not tons of it left on there
because I don't want it to be super
thick I want to go in and build it up oh
my gosh this is itching me okay
so rule of thumb is the first place that
you touch your brush on your face is
going to be the darkest area so if you
want your contour to be the darkest
right here you're going to start there
and go up which I don't I want it to be
darkest back here because that's going
to give us the most shadowing so I'm
going to start back here now here is the
tip to go from the top of your ear to
the corner of your mouth if you have
like a huge round face or you know
overweight or you can't find your
cheekbones you're just one of those
people who barely have cheekbones which
I don't think I have great cheekbones at
all a lot of people tell me I do but I
think it's just my makeup but you can
see my face right now without makeup and
I don't think I have great cheekbones um
no but anyways this works for everybody
no matter what your face shape is top of
the ear to the corner of the mouth you
do not want to take your bronzer all the
way to the corner of your mouth you want
to stop right about the arch of your
eyebrow
out from there so start at the top of
your ear like this and you want to keep
it underneath that cheekbone okay so you
see that line starting top of the ear
and you just bring it down I'm going to
stop it right about there and the arch
of my eyebrow okay now I have like that
leftover pox on there I'm gonna just
wipe a little bit of a way like on the
back of my hand
a paper towel napkin whatever so now we
have that line you can leave it like
that if you're going for like a really
dramatic look and then go on with blush
and other stuff I mean that's like Kim
Kardashian but I take it you don't want
to necessarily blend it upward or
downward you just want to kind of rub it
in circular motions until the brush
picks up some more products because you
don't want this to go up too high or too
low as it's going to defeat the purpose
so now that there's barely anything left
on my brush I'm bringing it forward to
the core in my mouth just to give it
like air way to blend out
since there's barely anything on my
brush I can move up and around but you
never want to move down and sometimes
when I get done contouring people even
go on with their foundation brush and I
will go away this and sculpt owl their
contour so that it's not falling down
because it falls down you to be the
purpose and now you can see how much
just doing that one simple step is
sculpting out this side of my face and
giving this dimension in nothing over
here yeah take that brush I'm going to
dip it again this time just like twice
and then I'm going to take that and I'm
going to just go right up here on the
side of my forehead right by my hairline
you can bring this to the center of your
forehead right here I don't normally do
that I normally just keep it right here
I like to keep this area light for the
most part you can go in there and put a
little bit right in the hairline if you
want especially if you have a big area
right there but more than anything I
just put it right there on the hairline
okay so now you can see this side of my
face compared to this side of my face
like sculpt it out and you can see my
cheekbones makes my eyebrows look more
arched and higher and then this side
it's just like way more dull yes yes yes
got it okay so let's just do the other
side really quickly just grab it in top
of the ear go down
well like I said take it from the corner
top of the ear down and then stop right
in that area because once you get to
that area you don't want to take it too
far to the mouth and then after wiping
off your brush go back
just stamp it out
the fishy face will definitely help
now like I was hanging out before you
don't want to blend your bronzer like up
or down but if you have to go one or the
other my hair is insane you're gonna
want to blend it up because you can
blend it into your blush when you put
that on so you definitely don't want to
blend it down so then I'll go back with
this
sculpt that out okay for head like
sculpting the face is so super easy I
mean unless you're doing it really
intensely um I have gotten so many
requests for Kim Kardashian highlighting
contouring video that I do think I'm
gonna do that next um just because
people are so interested in seeing how
she does it because she really goes out
there um so if you guys still really
want to see a Kim Kardashian
highlighting contouring video with a lot
of products and crazy highlighting
contour I let me know I will do it okay
that is done nice and easy right so next
we are going to go in with our blush my
favorite blush by Mac of all time is
peaches which looks like this it is just
a peachy color and it looks good on
pretty much everybody
unless hmm there's just some people
doesn't look good on but for the most
part it's gorgeous it's just it goes on
such a light wash and it is just
beautiful tone if you guys want me to do
a favorite blushes video I can do that
for you so just let me know as of today
I am just going to use peaches
Ashley what's happening so I'm just
going to dip my brush in there and I've
got a good amount of products on there
okay and this is a 1:29 short handle I
believe yeah the 1:29 short handle um I
think these are still sold in Mac stores
not Mac counters but they should still
be a Mac source I don't know why I have
the short handle one I just do I think I
got it for free um okay so with blush oh
this is the part that like I honestly am
the most excited for so I'm a blush
freak um with blush depending where you
put your blush it's going to give you a
different look but the most flattering
way to apply blush is on the side of the
cheeks now once again wherever you touch
your brush in the first place that is
where it's going to be the most intense
so when I go in I do not hold my brush
like this in front of my face and go
like that because you're gonna have like
a blob right here and that's not cute it
rounds out the face and we just sculpted
it so we don't want it to look round so
what I do is I start right here on the
side in this area so right like below
the arch of my eyebrow I start right
there
and I just go upward now as you can see
I like grab the brush underneath my
contour and I kind of blend those two
together okay so you can see that gives
my face even more duck as opposed to
this side it really brings your face
alive so I mean I personally think that
the face is more important than the eyes
because it really really lightens you up
um so same thing I always make like a
fishy base of some sort some people
smile to see it
I don't like smiling I don't ask my
clients to smile I just when I start in
that same place every time
and I just drag it up as you can tell I
like to dab even with my contour I don't
like to really do this a lot because I
just think that when you do this it
presses the pigments into the skin as
opposed to just dragging it around it's
kind of just like a turkey like I don't
know I just always like to press because
I think that it looks much more natural
so depending how pigmented you want your
blush you just go over this I do not
like to bring it in too far to the nose
I like to leave this area right here
blank so that there's no anything there
except just foundation I don't like my
blush to be there then what I do is I
take a brush like this Mac does not sell
anymore because they're annoying
um but Sigma does and I take a
highlighting powder of any sort I'm
going to take this one which is max I
think it's a light sweep like sweep and
then that accentuate down there um Ben
Nye banana powder then nice cameo power
looks like this they're all great mac
mineralize skinfinish in light great any
power you have in a light shade it'll
work I'm taking this because not only is
it a powder it's made for highlighting
so you can see it has like a sheen in it
I'm wondering if you can see that Sheen
has in the camera
can you see that it's got a little bit
of a glow but it's not like oh god she's
not Sparkle on her face it just has some
light in it so I take my brush and I
swirl it around and then I tap a bunch
of time so there's not tons of pigment
on there cuz I never 1 times a pigment
because I want to build and I start in
the corner of my eye and I dab straight
down in a v-shape up and I bring this
all the way back to my temples in that
area that we want to highlight and I use
this to set my concealer um I do not let
people leave the store without having
their concealer set I think that it is
extremely important because even if the
concealer promise is not to crease it is
a liquid and it is going to settle into
fine lines where I think that powder
does not as much so if you can tell this
area looks much more smooth and also
doing this last helps to blend my blush
into my highlights so that there's no
like sharp lines and over here it's not
a sharp line but you can see it over
here it really blends all of that
together
okay okay so I'm going to do the other
eye again I just messily put that in
there tap off the excess and then I
start in the inner corner I go down I go
up back to the temple
and I just cover this whole area I want
the main highlight with this powder to
be right here under my eye area right
there where I'm touching and just
blending out that blush so I'm going to
use Mac's soft and gentle and I'm going
to take a synthetic brush I think that
it applies it a lot more smoothly than a
goat hairbrush so I have that on there I
tap it off we're going to highlight in
this area right here underneath the arch
of the eyebrow if you want to bring in a
little bit more you can bring up right
in here where naturally you're usually a
little bit wider in that area so I am
going to take that brush and I'm going
to start off by dabbing just going to do
with everything else and I'm going to
bring it up around my eyebrow right up
here and then come back down then after
that I'm going to just literally I
barely touch it I just like one dab and
then I still tap because it is heavy and
then I swipe because when you swipe with
this it's going to get all of those
little sparkly pigments even on the skin
so that you don't have like chunks or
anything it'll just even it out you
don't want to bring this down too far
when you're highlighting because you do
have the bronzer the blush and the
highlight and you don't want to mix this
all together with the highlight because
you're going to have a mess so now you
can see the different colors and the
different textures I have a matte
contour I have a matte blush but then I
have that really shimmery highlight and
I drag it down just a tiny bit onto my
blush just to give my blush a little bit
of Sheen to it so you can see the
difference between that side and that
side that side has a little bit of a
highlight from what I put on as my eye
but it's not like that side that has
that really intense glow so I'll do it
here and I bring it up on top if you're
not wearing eye makeup and you haven't
done your mascara or anything yet you
can just take this and go like this over
top of your eyes it's what we used to do
and that will highlight this area in
this area at the same time and if you
want your head to be intent more intense
like I said you can obviously go ahead
and do more sometimes I'll get to word
and I'll be like oh I want to add some
gold in there so I'll take one like this
that has more gold tone and I'll just
dab just one dab right there in the
corner
I might off my brush just and give it
more of a gold chin and then and after
all of that I recommend that you set
your makeup by either spraying it was
something like fixed plus or max mineral
charged water or yeah girl or I use
Mario Badescu facial spray um whatever
you want I just recommend you use
something I literally just
drench my face in it then I have to put
my eyes forward because my lashes on my
bottom if they touch like that wet skin
it'll get black mascara everywhere so it
has like put my head forward but all its
gonna do is make like the powder
pigments mixed in with the foundation
it'll make everything look much more
natural um I spray one of these on my
face throughout the day and it really
does refresh my makeup and looks me
makes me look much more dewy and alive
and if you use any powder on your face
at all I really do recommend this so
yeah after that you are completely done
I hope you guys enjoyed this video let
me know if you do want to see the Kim
Kardashian highlighting in contour which
is much more intense and expensive um
yeah just let me know um I will see you
guys soon love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
