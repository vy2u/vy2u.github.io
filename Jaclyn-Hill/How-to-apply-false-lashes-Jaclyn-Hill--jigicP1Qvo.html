an in-depth tutorial showing you how to
apply false lashes I know that when you
first try to apply false lashes on
yourself it's typically a very
aggravating and irritating experience so
I'm going to share with you a lot of
tips and tricks that I have learned and
picked up along the way and hopefully
it'll make your experience of applying
false lashes much easier and more
comfortable false lashes are basically
gonna take any look and just bump it up
to the next level it's like the dot at
the end of the sentence so it'll take
any pretty everyday look and just make
it glamorous and just over-the-top
beautiful more like something that you
would see in a magazine or on a
celebrity on the red carpet so I am
going to be using my absolute favorite
brand of lashes today in this video and
if you watched my channel you know
what's coming it's the velour lashes
they are 100% mink fur there is no
animal cruelty in the process of making
these or whatsoever you can read about
that on their website I will sit down
below I have been using these
religiously by the past six months to
eight months maybe I've been using it
strike a pose which is the name of the
lashes and I've only gone through two
pairs in six months two pairs and I you
literally apply false lashes a couple
times a week so they literally left
forever they say it can be worn up to
twenty-five times I would say more like
thirty to thirty five times as long as
you're taking care of them oh my gosh
that is beautiful since they are make
fur they look like feathers on your eyes
they just look so natural it's insane
they're just gorgeous uh so anyways I do
a discount code for you it is Jacqueline
velour 15 if you're interested in trying
some for yourself today is the perfect
day because they actually released three
new styles this morning so my discount
code will be lasting until October 31st
so if you want to advantage of it you've
got ten days baby ten days so first
thing that you want to make sure of is
that you have a mirror in front of you I
just have like one of these swivel
Mina's where one side is magnified and
one side is not I would definitely
recommend going to the magnified side
now the most important thing is that you
are looking down into your mirror you do
not want to be looking like this
that's gonna be super aggravating when
you're trying to apply false lashes you
want it to be I would say about right
here and then turn it upwards that way
you're at that really uncomfortable
awkward upshot and golden to yourself
that is how you should be looking in
your mirror when applying false lashes
okay so I lowered my camera down a
little bit
I know this is not the most flattering
angle but this is not about me right now
and this is about learning how to apply
false lashes so when you get a box of
false lashes you're obviously gonna have
to in there and the way they're place is
exactly how they're gonna go on your eye
so this is gonna go in this eye and this
is gonna go on this side just like so
you don't want to turn it around in the
music wait which one which one because a
lot of times false lashes it's kind of
difficult to tell which is the inner
corner and which is the outer corner so
I always just go like this hold up to
your face
this one this this one that die when
taking them out of the package you can
sometimes rip false lashes just because
you're still eager to grab them and pull
them out that never has happened to me
the lower lashes before but since
cheaper lashes that can tend to happen
so I just always use tweezers to get
them out just to ensure that I'm not
gonna rip them at all and I do start
with the outer edge when I take them out
and then you just pull like that and
it'll just come right out on your
tweezers so first thing you want to do
is measure to your eye shape and see if
it is going to be too long and if it
needs any trimming so as you can see
this is a much too long for my eye that
is not cute you want to make sure that
the lash ends right in this area before
you get to the end of your eyeball as
you can see this makes me look tired
when you look at me this eye looks much
more sleepy and worn out than this eye
does you do not want a lash that extends
past your liner or past your eye it's
just not a good look so you're going to
want to trim it you always want to trim
from the outer corner never from the
inner corner if you trim from the inner
corner what's gonna happen is these
shorter ones right here are gonna be
taken off and you're gonna be left with
the longer ones then you're gonna have
that lash we're in the inner corner you
don't have a gradual increase in the
length instead it's just gonna start off
long and get longer and it's just not
gonna look natural so just always trim
from the outer corner so since it was a
really too long for me I'm going to just
go in and cut off that area this is very
awkward to do while holding it up on
camera and a lot of times I'll have to
go back and trim it two or three times
just because I rather not trim enough
and have to go back and now see I could
leave it like that
definitely but me personally I like to
take off a tiny bit more because I don't
like the lashes to go too far in my
inner corner otherwise it can kind of
to stab you throughout the day okay so
that is perfect first thing you're gonna
want to do is apply mascara I do not
apply a really thick coat of mascara
when I am working with velour lashes
because they are so beautiful that I
don't want to take away anything from
them so just apply the thinnest layer of
mascara possible I also do not curl my
lashes because if I curl them then it is
much more complicated to get the lashes
on around that intense curl and get it
in there
it's just a hassle I prefer just to let
these lashes do as they please they're
so beautiful and so natural I just try
to keep everything else very toned down
so I'm just going to be using this
Rimmel lash accelerator mascara
it's just drugstore mascara you
obviously don't need to be using like a
YSL mascara for this it's not gonna
really be showing up so I'm just gonna
coat my lashes with a thin coat of
mascara but you do want to make sure
that you get pretty much every lash
because these lashes are so black if you
leave your lashes with no mascara on it
you will be able to see the
disconnection between the black fake
lashes and then your lashes so make sure
that you try to get all of the hairs
lovely are you kidding me once you file
your mascara wait just like a minute or
two for it to dry just to avoid any
messes that could happen getting mascara
all over your hands or getting it all
over the false lashes and ruining the
false lashes just wait it'll make it
much easier I'm gonna be using the duo
eyelash adhesive this is probably the
most popular lash glue in the cosmetic
industry you can find it pretty much
anywhere CVS Walgreens Target Walmart
even sold at the MAC counter and Mac
stores it is the waterproof one the
difference is the non waterproof one has
the blue on the packaging as opposed to
the pink and the non waterproof dries
clear it is a white when it comes out I
don't think it dries clear I honestly
think it drives more of a beige not to
mention it's not waterproof um this one
I just I think it lasts so much longer
it stays on better and if for some
reason you feel like tearing up or
crying during the day for no reason your
eyelash will pop off on you like minded
at the altar on my wedding day look good
times so the way I apply my lash glue is
I just take it straight from here
there's many different ways you can
apply it
a tip you can apply on a tray with your
hands I think this is the easiest way I
just squeeze it I get a little bit of it
to come out at the top like that and
then I just take it and I run it along
the top of the lashes you do not need
tons
yes little bubbles will come out you're
fine it's no problem you just get a
little thin line like that make sure
that there's not any big spaces or gaps
that's all you need you don't need to go
overboard with tons of lash glue that's
more than enough right there if you put
this directly on your eye right now it
is gonna be a disaster I think that's
the number one problem and the stake
that we make when we first try to apply
our lashes we're like oh my god there's
blue on it hurry apply it and it's like
slipping and sliding around you're
getting lash glue all over your
eyeshadow it's just it's a hot mess so
just sit here and let this dry for at
least thirty to forty seconds do not
worry the longer you let it dry and get
tacky the easier that it's going to be
to apply on your lip on your eyes hips
up so it's been probably a minute at
this point so I'm going to apply them
now so once again the mirrors angled up
at me slightly like the camera let me
I'm gonna zoom in a little bit for you
so what we're gonna do is with our hands
we're going to take it and we're just
going to drop it right there on the eye
it is not on at all the outer corner is
not on nothing is on it's just sitting
there
so with tweezers I'm now gonna grab the
false lash as you can see and I'm going
to pinpoint it right there on the bottom
let go there we go so just push it in
there like that now you can see the
inner corner is not on that's just
flopping around we're gonna do the same
thing we're gonna take that and just
push it then to assure that I have them
on as low as possible because you don't
want your lashes to be up in the middle
of your eyelid or super high it's not
gonna look natural so I just kind of
gently squeeze just to make sure that
they are as close together as possible
and making them look as natural as
possible you can see how much more awake
and alive this aisle
as opposed to this one with absolutely
no lashes it makes such a difference and
as you can see these lashes are just in
sane have you ever seen lashes this
pretty before they're seriously so
fluffy it's over donkey dog alright so
same thing after about 40 seconds I am
just going to drop that there and then
I'm going to take this inner corner and
pop it on I do the inner corner on my
left eye first just because I'm
right-handed and it makes it easier and
I do the outer corner on this side just
it really doesn't make a difference
which corner you do first then taking
the outer corner doing the same thing
and pushing it down there we go
just because I'm a perfectionist I'm
going to take some of makeup geeks gel
liner this is immortal it's a black
black gel liner and I just go over that
base try not to get it on the lashes
themselves because that definitely can
dull down the life of the lashes and
make them not last as long um that's why
we avoid putting mascara or eyeliner on
them because it will definitely cut down
the life of the lashes you want to try
to keep them as clean and away from any
other makeup products as possible
to keep them looking the best for as
long as possible so now we have the
completed look I really hope that you
