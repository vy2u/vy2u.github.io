doing an eyeliner video for you this is
a video that is not to citing for me but
I've gotten so many requests from you
guys to do it I feel like I just need to
do it to get it out of the way and when
you guys asks for an eyeliner ask for an
eyeliner video I'm assuming you're
meaning the way I apply my eyeliner
basically all my videos so I am NOT
going to talk your ear off about it I am
just going to get started um first thing
is I have absolutely no makeup on my
face whatsoever right now so take a good
look ladies because this is reality this
is just the way I personally apply
eyeliner everybody has their own ways
everybody has their own techniques but
this is how I do it so I'm going to
share with you so first of all I use a
Mac 208 brush it looks like this and
that black in there brushes like two
years old that black is just it's there
permanently it's never going to leave
it's just stuck in there nice and good I
know a lot of people say these brushes
fall apart really easily and they have
to be replaced a lot which can be true
but I take little scissors like this
when I get like flyaways and I go in
there and I cut like that
and I cut little pieces off can you see
it so like
I cut like that
I've only had to do that a couple of
times with this brush but like otherwise
this front area right here can get
really frayed okay it's totally Zune
folks ami
this right here can get super frayed and
like stick out and make it so that when
you're putting your eyeliner on it's not
precise because it's like all over the
place not cute so anyways this is the
brush I use Mac's 208 it's a good brush
I have actually no complaints about it
whatsoever so then next I use Maybelline
eye studio gel liner and it is in black
blackest black I used to use this by Mac
which looks the exact same that's Mac
and that's Maybelline but look
Maybelline is blacker can you see that
oh I see it oh yeah Mac looks like
almost grey next how freaking black
Maybelline is I mean that's just like a
black of this where Mac almost looks
gray next to it that's Mac and that's
Maybelline
that's insane I've never held those next
to each other before I'm telling you
this name billion gives Mac a run for
their money with Mac and the black track
I would apply it and I have to go back
later and do it again because it just
wouldn't look as black within like two
hours I'm big ok my eyeliner looks gray
but this I put it on and it does not
move and it is pitch black all day long
okay so I am going to get into this I'm
going to take the eyeliner and this is
how I dip it in there I hold it like
this I take my brush my go like this
get it all nice and covered and then I
go on the edges am I going this and the
reason I do this is because I want the
brush to look like that and it's just
like perfect as can be covered in that
liquid liner and it doesn't it's not
afraid it's not Gumpy gooey whatever
okay so now I'm going to take it and
this is the one beauty thing I do it
wrong and I can totally admit it to you
guys I pull on my eyelid I pull it taut
I don't do it when I'm doing my
eyeshadow or anything else but when I am
doing my eyeliner I take my eye on my
finger I put it right here and I tug at
it a little bit like that and I know it
is such a bad habit and I hate myself
for it I can do eyeliner without it but
it's just like the moment I get right
there I'm just like oh I cannot help but
I have to touch my eyes when I'm doing
this okay
so I always personally start in wait
what do I start I start on the outer
corner I start right here the first
thing I do is I put my brush down and I
just start moving it around so that I
get it on like so and then I took my
brush the opposite way so we were just
like this and now I'm going to go like
this with the point in the inner corner
and I start going like this
okay so there's just like the outer edge
of it so now at this point because I
just did that layer there's still
products on my brush but it's not as
much as I want and it's not as black as
I want so again I just dab at one side
and then go like that so that's still on
there okay so now is when I grab my eye
because my eyelashes get in my way
that's the issue is like I touch here
and my eyelashes get up there and get
those little dots like did you see what
I just created those tiny little dots up
there whatever it's annoying
okay so I put my ID on and then I'm
going to touch that point in my most
inner corner
so in the air corner I want it to be
rounded right here in this area I don't
want it to be flat I wanted to have a
round shape but I want to continue the
roundness up and thicker to the outer
part of my eye this is basically going
to work for all eye shapes now if you
have Katy Perry eyes where you're really
round eyed when I am doing makeup on
girls with eyes like that or guys with
eyes like that I just do one band just
straight across kind of like this
nothing thicker nothing thinner it's
just like a rainbow because that looks
really good on perfectly round eyes
I have almond shaped eyes so that is not
what I want to do I don't want to do an
all-around round effect on my eyes so
I'm going to show you again I go in the
inner corner
okay so I don't really do a wing so I'm
going to show you how I do my wing but
see right there it needs to be built up
more because if you can see it goes
round and then it's kind of like table
tops out I know you see what I'm talking
about so I don't want that tabletop
there so I'm going to just
so you can see I'm beginning to fix it
and I'll talk to this
now I go and do my wing so that anything
happening on the eye can be perfected
later after I do the wing so with not
tons of product on my brush and you want
to make sure that the brush is nice and
tight
I don't know you want to make sure the
brush is very pointed at this point and
now the trick to doing winged eyeliner
I'm going to zoom you in just like a
little bit more even closer
hey okay so as you can see my lower lash
line right there it has an angle to it
and you follow that up right there to
the corner like this so if I look down
you can see even more like that that is
going to be your perfect angle for a
wing okay right like that
if you take it up like this it's going
to be too elevated if you take it
straight out it's probably so flattering
on your eye unless you have a lot of
cool I shout out going on around it
where you know it's up here and it's
down here and you want to even it out
with the line in between that's cool but
for just an everyday winged cat eye look
you're going to want to follow the
natural shape of your eye so take your
brush um a lot of people say that it
helps if your elbow is stabilized on
something like a desk or a table I don't
really care if my amah stabilized or not
a lot of people feel more comfortable
whatever makes you know you happy but so
you're going to put your brush right
there at this angle with the point
facing down some people enjoyed this I
like to go like this it doesn't matter
and you're just gonna flick it right
there
okay now see that's not perfect but it
doesn't matter because it's in that
vicinity now I turn around like this
okay so there is your perfect line so
that right there
see that it follows right along with my
bottom lash line right up there so now
that we have that just take that and
just flatten it out I like to start
right here I don't like to go all the
way to the back of the wing
and then I like to bring it upward so
with my wing I like to take it and kind
of swoop this way to continue that
roundness that we have on the top of the
eye I don't want to just lay this and
then straight down I kind of want to
round it up and across my eye so now
that we have that around this I'm going
to fill in that empty space right there
like that
and there is your range liner it's so
simple you can even take that brush if
you want to make that point you just a
little bit more precise and just touch
it like that
