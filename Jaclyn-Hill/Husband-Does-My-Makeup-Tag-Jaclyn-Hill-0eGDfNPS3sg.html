to be doing the husband times goodbye
today we are going to be doing the
husband does my makeup job I'm not gonna
say today we're here I'm so fancy you
already know
you have a hater on your bottom lip that
is so long that it's curled cut it I'm
not gonna cut it me always want to be
this oh that's gonna hurt oh I got it
hey guys today we were going to be doing
the now that it was so excited to
finally be filming this video because as
you guys know I've been talking about
this video now for like what feels like
months and it has been so difficult to
coordinate our schedule
my husband John here he is a drummer and
he just recently joined a new band and
so he has been crazy busy with that so
it has been like impossible to even
spend a whole day together let alone
find the time sit down oh we haven't
seen each other oh and actually lately
I'm I'm always busy he's always busy it
kind of sucks but it's schedule so I get
home really late and she's done for the
night and yeah you get it's great it's
crying this is actually John's first
time ever being on camera with me other
than maybe just like popping in real
quick just like to give me a kiss
goodbye as he leaving
but his first official video here on
YouTube so show him some love be nice
alright if he is gonna actually try
gonna try to be I'm gonna try to do the
best job they told me I like don't try
it
don't try to be stupid I know I'm gonna
try to do really good but make mama
proud
but there's I'm just going to say
there's a good chance that it's going to
look like a clown so let's get started I
have laid out like a huge amount of
makeup right here like three different
eyeshadow palettes highlight contour
blushes many different lips colors like
everything that way he has his pick I've
given him all the brushes he needs but
I'm not gonna give him any guidance any
step of the way I'm not gonna help him
because I pretty sure that's how this
works right like I'd be cheating
you can't help so yeah we'll see how he
does so the only problem is I just don't
know what any of this is I know what to
do like the steps I just don't know
which is which
so yeah he picked up like a super frosty
highlighter earlier he's like this is
face powder right and I was like I dream
together stay together what's true
cheers Cheers
I'm looking at this like from your
perspective like I'm trying to imagine
all these things I got here like wrong
things like drum cheese and stands and
I'm just like I could never I don't know
how you just tell me which to go first
which goes first
I mean let's start with the face I know
that's the okay the foundation that's
kind of dark to be foundational I think
so I'm just gonna I'm gonna keep going
something that looks better
I thought I told you that I'm gonna do
good I'm just gonna brew in your face
all right okay watch this just make up
this is bad before foundation oh yeah
you spray you prime your prime it okay
so that's what you're gonna do you're to
spray that I remember I know
so now right now right now I'm gonna be
spraying this photo finish primer water
amaze love it and that's gonna go ahead
and go ahead pray on her face do you all
right see that can you do that it keeps
the makeup on the face but that's what
holds the makeup yeah I went jogging on
point but yes okay I'm telling what the
foundation is because you just don't
know what the foundation is I know what
to do not really but I think I know what
to do I know the steps
cuz I studied her video but I just I
just need to know which ones wish okay
okay so what how you gonna do this you
know you do you do it over love it
you're my makeup artists you got this
boot I believe in you you do that right
totally
that's not one very pretty fish shape
space thanks babe
why are your hands so excatly callus oh
because of the drums who's that my girls
there's some rough
we have brushes yes doesn't use a brush
for that I've always seen you go like
that like that I feel like I've seen you
like when you start you're like and you
started like that and you're like no no
you've done that before that's why yeah
what timer that's with this primer I
always start with this primer and I go
like this oh this is what you start with
yeah now it is the highlight we're gonna
contour I feel like this brush you have
black on it before I probably did oh no
using Mac Pro emphasize mm-hmm oh yeah I
should probably show you guys yeah
that's what he's using now to highlight
okay so you've done foundation so far
foundation and what do you plan on doing
next I'm planning on contouring okay
just tell me in please just like come on
Oh concealer yes thank you
now I'm gonna do great oh I know that
the whole brush thing here why is this
on it you're so cute
look how cute you are even you'll still
be cute after I do this I'm sure you'll
be very cute only thing I'm confused
about is this naked skin concealer
it's got like a thing like it looks like
you should be putting on your lips or
like your eye lashes so I'm like I
supposed to put that on your face okay
make it work okay just do you I'm ready
I've never been more ready in my entire
life are you really contemplated are you
shaking hopeful notice of my other girl
atashi that's not cheating okay
splat me with some concealer babe
it's another point this perfectly I
already did the foundation what brush
are you using the morphe palette brush
palette it doesn't say anything about
like I'd be a better makeup artist if I
was standing I'm sure that's the problem
cover up that redness now I'm going to
shade with the darkness the dark one
contour
yeah the contour here's the fou faced
looks like Foo Fighters like that looks
like their logo
okay so two-faced which I am now going
to refer to as foo face for the red face
forever hopefully that's not a match
okay I'm ready very steady hand okay go
like this with your cheeks there you go
oh I think that's that goes the white
part but okay blending is key so trace
blend it out and then press we're toast
no way look at me oh my god look like
the Joker has a fricken smile up okay
I'll fix this I'll cover it up you know
cover it up with what I'm gonna
highlight while using Mac Pro emphasize
well I'm just gonna highlight underneath
to show this shape of the lemon the
cheekbone yes are you kidding
yes you were really watching my contour
video are you being sarcastic no I'm
serious the fact that you he's baking
right now that's what he's trying to do
all babies first baby you're serious
because of the fact that you know to put
some light under the console to carve it
out enough to put light everywhere
there's not dark blendin king I mean
honestly it feels like my contour is on
fleek does it it does wanna see you you
look great this is apparently the most
important part okay still doesn't have
to do a start
with the naked skin so we did Foundation
and then we did powder and now we're
putting concealer over that right okay
and we're gonna get the eyebrows on
fleek okay I am so lost do mean to tell
you what you use in the eyebrows yeah
just tell me but there's nothing on it
what do you mean don't you put black on
it you know Oh Oh perfect okay this is
the brow is break that brow is and I
break you
these are so good
such cute eyebrows so basically your
you've already shaping your eyebrows yes
the brows have been shaped so you just
want to really darken those in because
they're already on fleek okay we're good
to know they look good I would like to
do something like this oh my gosh I'm
doing a makeup tutorial with blues next
no way we are so on the same page we're
also meant to be it's like a Z Gallerie
when I want to get the same umbrella
that you already bought em I feel paper
towels you see the mermaid mermaid by
makeup geek makeup geek I'm gonna be
doing mermaid why am I not surprised
that you want to do color this is gonna
be the bottom it's gonna blend up to
that and then up to that okay man with
the plan do wait I'm gonna do your wing
all right
close your eyes blend it yes all right I
got the wing started like this brush a
little thick did the tad oh it's so red
isn't it I'm serious I love that color
oh my god was I hurt no what I'm just
imagining what's happening okay so
that's how I normally look what I do my
makeup
no you look way hotter when you do your
makeup oh hi what up look up oh my god I
promise he's gonna give me a wing like I
always do or do something different it
might okay I'm gonna do a wing tell them
what brush you're using for the liner
using the mac 242 japan brush
good to know that Mac brushes are made
in Japan some yeah the Mac - 42 - 42
this kind of ties it all together
seriously did you give me my way mm-hmm
yeah here what time why are we might be
just a blender better than you thought
it would be no I thought I'd do way
better really yeah kill it
Oh are we blending again got a blender I
knew you would use that color he's now
using rule by Mac cuz his favorite color
is orange I knew that he would use this
you're totally giving me inspiration
with these blues and these goals these
oranges I'm about miss life so they can
see how you're apply this mascara oh my
god oh my god look up am i looking up
okay a whole new color that we have not
used together just to cover up the black
I'm obviously going to do these right
now yep time for lashes you put the glue
on the lash
give me nice alright I'm just gonna go
ahead and do the lips you're not gonna
do blush or highlight oh of course
sorry blush what do you guys think oh
it's definitely the first one I feel
like so I'm gonna get a big old this is
like her biggest brush she's got this
little cup and I saw this one I was like
that's the one because it's so pieced
and I just want this to be very big I
don't like the mild I don't want to
pound it on so let me use something like
that what's your motto blend until your
fingers bleed or something blend until
your hands and your eyes hurt that's
right that's my philosophy that's a good
one blend until your fingers bleed I
like yours better this is a it's the
mary lou AKA lou manizer by the balm to
make it look and the cheekbones yep yeah
if I'm saying the bottom of the
cheekbones no baby it's okay no we were
watching the video and I was like you
always gonna highlight the top so your
cheekbones as though it's important
remember mhm
that's right yeah you want to do the
orange I think so so you're gonna use
the Nastasia Beverly Hills persimmon
okay let me just explain to you guys I
love jacqueline and like a bright orange
red or like really red lip I like very
like dramatic lip on her I'll bet his
favorite any time I wear about like even
like a dark brown lip even black like
dark blue dark green
he likes bold lips I just ruined them
yeah keep going we're with it you know
what I should have done I should have
done like a rule like that make a peach
something a little like a nude yeah like
a new I should go nude you should have
gone so bold on your first attempt okay
wash up and do a new please the mirror
is behind that light Oh
tonight I want to see okay like in this
viewfinder I can only see like some blue
of my eyes and like orangie on my lips
but I can't like I thought that
everything besides the lips was really
good okay okay this is honestly not that
bad like it could get worse I I'm
actually impressed by the fact that you
did that liner with the mac 242 brush
like this could be way worse okay
you made my lips look like shaky no
YouTube makeup King I think you actually
did a really good job on my first time
for well I don't think there's gonna be
a second time oh my god oh my god
anyways I hope that you guys enjoy this
if you do make sure you give it a thumbs
up and if you want to see John more

you and thank you for watching and with
