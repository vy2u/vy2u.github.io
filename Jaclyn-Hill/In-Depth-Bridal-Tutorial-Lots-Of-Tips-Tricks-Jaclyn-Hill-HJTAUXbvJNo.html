such an exciting video this is the most
requested video here on my channel of
all time and as you can tell by the
title it is a bridal makeup tutorial I
am so excited to be doing this johnny's
wedding anniversary is next month next
month yeah and it's our five-year
wedding anniversary and I was thinking
about it and then I was like why did a
bridal makeup tutorial yet oh my gosh so
I was very excited to put this look
together for you guys I have done so
many brides makeup in the past six years
I cannot even tell you and it's funny
because almost every single bride asks
for the exact same thing no matter how
dark how light they are in skin tone no
matter what color of their eyes
everyone asks for the same thing
everyone wants to look like they're
glowing from within everyone once they
look like themselves but just better and
everyone wants neutral colors on their
eyes but yet a little smokey but not too
smoky because we're not clubbing we're
gonna be a bride today so no matter how
many brides I have done it feels like I
do the exact same look on everybody but
it looks different on everybody because
we all have different faces and
different face shapes and different eye
colors and bone structure but it
literally is the same look because
everybody wants the same look so I
basically compiled all the bride's I've
done put it into one look and this is my
version of a timeless beautiful Bridal
look that you will never be embarrassed
by that you can show your grandchildren
years and years from now and you're
still gonna think that you looked
beautiful so I really hope that you guys
enjoy this look I enjoyed making it for
you I love this look I think it's
beautiful let me know how you guys feel
about it of course I always love hearing
what you guys have to say thank you so
much for watching and congratulations to
those that are getting married I love
you and I'll talk to you soon bye hey
guys so first thing is first you want to
start off with a completely bare face of
course and cleanse skin I always
recommend to do your makeup within 30
minutes of cleansing and moisturizing
because if you do it immediately after
you cleanse and moisturize
sometimes the foundation and the makeup
can kind of slip and slide because your
skin still hasn't absorb the moisturizer
if you wait too long sometimes the
makeup content not Laye is nice and not
last as long because your skin isn't
freshly clean so I usually like to do my
makeup about 30 minutes after I cleanse
and moisturize because I think that we
get the best results doing it that way I
am wearing hair extensions by the way
dog I clip in hair extensions any time
just want to go like that extra mile for
the glamour effect here exceptions to me
are kind of like false lashes because
it's like it can be good but then once
you clip in hair extensions it's like
that extra ah I wore hair extensions on
my wedding day but they weren't good
quality hair extensions and let me tell
you there is a difference oh my gosh my
hair extensions literally lasted the
night of my wedding and they were done
that was it poof gone destroyed these
are my absolute favorite they are the
Lily hair from Bellamy I'll link them
down below if you guys are looking for
really good quality durable hair
extensions they're awesome so you can
either start with your foundation or you
can start with your eyes I always start
with my eyes when I want to look my
absolute best or anytime that I am doing
a makeup application on a client because
if you start with your eyes then if you
have any fallout if you have your thumb
pressed up against your face while
you're doing something on your eye or
your eyeshadow you're not going to
destroy your foundation or your
concealer or your powder or whatever it
is you choose to put on the skin so I
start with the eyes that way if you get
fallout or anything else you can wipe it
away and then you can go and do your
foundation and concealer so on and so
forth it just ensures that your eyes and
your face are both going to look perfect
as opposed to doing foundation first and
then I sometimes it can get a little
messy so with that being said I'm going
to start off with eyes now I'm going to
prime my eyes this is the one thing that
you have to do I will tell you what you
can skip and what you can't this is a
stuff that you can not skip so I am
going to use Mac Pro Longwear concealer
in the shade NW 20 which is about the
same color as my lid area you always
want to match this area or go one shade
lighter you never want concealer darker
than your eyelid to prime the eyes for
shadow because that can make you look
very tired and bring this area down so
anything that's the same color or
lighter when this concealer came out I
was working at Mac at the time so I went
to the training seminar for this
concealer and they were talking about
how this concealer has a technology
built into it to prime the eyes along
with concealing which is amazing because
you get to basically kill two birds with
one stone I hate that expression but you
do because you get to cover up any
redness and veins in the eyelids and you
get to prime for eyeshadow so it's like
double si double instead of killing two
birds with one stone like who kills
birds with stones I'm going to be using
a lot of makeup geek eyeshadows because
there are some of the best eyeshadows
ever not
mentioned they are an amazing price they
are drugstore price eye shadows for a
mac quality shadow some of them even
better than mac so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm gonna take Peach
Smoothie by makeup geek which looks like
this I'm going to take a sigma e40 and
I'm going to just dust this all in this
crease area I'm gonna zoom you in a
little bit you're probably like what are
you doing you want to go in with a very
sheer amount at first and then build now
I pretty much have nothing left on this
brush whatsoever I'm just taking the
product that's already on there and just
kind of moving it around in circular
motions I go from inner to outer outer
to inner just in circular motions and I
move that and buff it upward to really
make it look perfect
I'm literally just buffing blend until
your eyes and your hands hurt that's my
philosophy so you can see it's just a
light peachy shade and honestly when
we're done with this look you're really
not gonna see that but it's gonna help
big-time along the way as we're blending
things out so NARMS gonna take a little
bit of creme Brule again this is by
makeup geek because what we want to do
is start off with a super light color
and then go a little bit darker a little
bit darker and a little bit darker doing
that is gonna give your eyes dimension
and give them a lot of life and make
them look very beautiful and blended so
taking creme brulee on an e25 I'm gonna
make sure that I get that all the way
down in that outer eye socket right here
and then just kind of sweeping that
around and then as there's nothing left
on my brush really I'm gonna blend that
upward towards the brow and a peach
smoothie with this eye look I am NOT
taking these colors all the way to the
inner corner I am stopping about right
here because I do not want this to be a
really hooded effect I want it to kind
of be a really soft cat eye and then
something I always do is just go back
with that original brush with no product
on it and then just sweep it in that
entire upper crease area because
blending is the most important part of
doing it your eye shadow so now I'm
going to go in with an even darker shade
so this right here is frappe frappe I
don't know now I'm gonna put this in
that low crease
and now again with pretty much no
product left I'm just going to buff
upward the reason we want to leave this
inner corner a little bit more blank as
opposed to the outer corner is because
in pictures especially it will really
open up the eyes if you have a very far
set eyes and you have a lot of room in
between your eyes then you would want to
take this and more to bring the eyes
closer in photos but if you have normal
set eyes a closed set eyes you want to
leave this inner corner you don't want
to put any darkness in there because
it'll really make you look very awake
and fresh in pictures I'm going to go in
with grain which is this color right
here it has a slight slight shimmer in
it but it's really nothing overboard I
don't want to use something really
really crazy like this one right here
that's shimma shimma by makeup geek it's
so beautiful
but for Bridal I don't want to do
something that intense for the average
bride so I'm going to use grain right
here and I'm also going to mix a little
bit of Naked Lunch with it once I have
grain laid down so see now right now I'm
going to take this area of my skin and
just lightly pull it and lay this down
like that if I was wearing Foundation
and concealer right now this would
totally mess up my concealer that's why
I do the eyes at first for moments like
this
now I'm gonna take a little bit of Naked
Lunch by Mac which is kind of like a
light pink baiji with a little shimmer
in it and it's gonna tap that on the
very inner corner this step is not
necessary I'm just doing this again for
a little extra pop now that we have the
grain in the Naked Lunch Jean I'm gonna
go in with makeup geek Barcelona Beach
and this is a really beautiful cool tone
gorgeous kind of gray Brown so I'm gonna
take that on any blending brush and I'm
just going to push it in this area and
this is going to help blend in this
color that we've put all over the lid
into these colors in our crease and it's
also going to add a little bit more
coolness in depth
and then of course I was going to run
over that really quickly with that
original brush that we went in and just
buff it out with no product on the brush
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to take a black eye Kohl I am using
smolder by Mac you can use whatever you
want there's great ones at the drugstore
you can use the L'Oreal one that's an
awesome
ichael and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to smudge this on my upper lash
line I am NOT going to be precise and
try to make this look pretty in any way
I'm just gonna get it as close and tight
as possible to that lash line and just
push it in there for what we're gonna do
next in that inner corner I'm barely
gonna touch it I'm just going to barely
flick it so that it's not too thick or
dense I'm going to like zoom you really
far in so that you can see that it's
actually messy and I'm not lying to you
at all it's messy but it doesn't matter
because we are going to blend that out
now and then what I'm going to do to
what I'm gonna do is take mac cosmetics
and bark this eye shadow is a staple for
everybody especially if you are a bride
I don't know if I've ever done a bride's
makeup without using embark it is just
such a perfect matte deep deep dark
brown and it's not super warm and it's
not super cool it's just it's a perfect
dark brown so I'm going to take embark
on this flat definer brush and I'm going
to do is I'm going to start in the inner
corner and I'm just going to start
buffing this liner out using a shadow
like embark will make sure that as we
are buffing and blending this liner out
but it's not going to be too harsh into
black this will make it a lot softer and
a lot prettier and then on that outer
corner I'm just kind of flicking it
upward so I want that embark and that
liner to blend in with that outer corner
crease color see I'm getting all sorts
of stuff underneath my eye area and this
is why we do eyes first so it's gonna
keep flicking that color upward so want
to be nice and gradual and then get
thicker and thicker and then just almost
we want that liner to just kind of
disappear in the outer corner we wanted
to go from a liner to just shadow just
like oh yes you
yes
so taking a sigma small angle e65 brush
I'm going to use this small angle brush
to just apply a little bit of this gel
liner and I'm going to apply it super
close to the lash line I'm not gonna do
any wing on myself even though I love a
winged eyeliner since we are doing a
really timeless beautiful Bridal look
I'm not going to do a wing today so I'm
going to push this super close to that
lash line and then just stop at the very
edge
now I'm going to be applying false
lashes I am going to be using the brand
velour lashes in the style strike a pose
these are one of my favorite lashes ever
if you are a bride I highly recommend
using mink lashes they are there's
nothing like them they're absolutely
beautiful any time I ever applied mink
lashes on any bride or anybody for that
fact they would always be shocked by how
just beautiful and glamorous and fluffy
it just takes your look to another level
of glamorous it's kind of like
extensions in your hair it just makes
everything better it's same with mean
clashes or any lashes for that matter
individual lashes are another great way
for a bride to go but it's very
time-consuming if you have 15-20 minutes
to sit there and every little individual
lash it's gonna look absolutely gorgeous
but if you just want to get the job done
quick I would go with mean clashes I
will link all of my favorite lashes down
below on my favorite like mink lash
companies and favorite styles and stuff
like that because there's a lot and I
have quite a few favorites when you're
working with me glasses you never want
to do mascara after the lashes are on
because it will ruin them and if it
doesn't ruin them immediately it will
cut down the longevity of the lashes
life I use tweezers to apply my lashes
you can do it however you please this is
what is just easy peasy for me
so this is the difference one eyewitness
and one eye without lashes so now we are
going to move on to foundation
foundation is always a really big deal
to every bride of course because you
want your skin to look flawless but you
don't want to look overdone or caked up
whatsoever on your wedding day or any
other day for that matter I always
suggest picking out your foundation at
least a few weeks before your wedding
wearing it a couple days trying it out
making sure that your skin really reacts
well to it when picking out a foundation
you want to find one that is made for
your skin type so if your oily you're
gonna want to try something like Estee
Lauder Double Wear your dry you're gonna
want to try something like giorgio
armani luminous silk or L'Oreal True
Match Lumi something that is made for
your skin type and then along with that
you also want to avoid that flash
photography making your face look stark
white so what you want to do is find in
foundation that has a low SPF or a no
SPF in it something that no higher than
SPF 10 anything less than that you will
be good and it will not give you that
flash back and photography which no one
likes so the first thing I'm gonna do is
prime my face I personally do not prime
my face on a day-to-day basis but for a
special occasion like this I will just
because I'm normal and a little dry my
foundation doesn't move but for those of
you who have an issue with that you
might want to try a long wearing primer
this one is Tarte clean slate flawless
and this is the 12 hour brightening
primer so this is supposed to last for
12 hours so it will help with the
longevity of the foundation what you
always want on a day like your wedding
day okay so now I am gonna go in with my
tried-and-true foundation and this is my
George George
Giorgio Armani a luminous silk
foundation this is my absolute favorite
foundation ever it does not have an SPF
in it which I love my skin reacts well
to it it stays on for so long but that
is just me another foundation that I
absolutely love if I really want it to
last a long time is Make Up For Ever HD
foundation these are just my two
personal favorites when it comes to my
skin looking really flawless and lasting
a long time and not wanting any SPF
whatsoever make it forever is gonna make
me more matte wear Giorgio Armani is
gonna look much more like my skin and on
the dewy side and and then what I'm
going to do is just take my finger and
put like one dot here one dot here and
one dot here I am NOT going to take more
than that and put it all over the face
because when you do that sometimes you
can overdo it and not realize oh I put
too many dots on my face and then you
have too much product and that's when
you start to get cake face
so I only do three dots I do not do more
than that I'm just going to begin
pressing this into the skin at first I'm
gonna have pretty much no coverage but
that's okay because it's better to start
with barely anything and then build up
then I have too much and not know how to
get rid of it
this foundation is clearly darker than
my face but it is the perfect match to
my neck and the rest of my body and so I
always match people's necks and their
arms as opposed to their faces because
if I were to match my face I would have
like a butt white face and then like a
semi tan body and that is not okay so I
did two pumps and that covered my whole
face including blending it down in this
area you do not want a line of
demarcation right here on the jaw so
make sure that you always blend in this
area to really get it down sometimes on
some Brides I'll even take it and put a
little bit on their ear just because
they're eat sometimes your ears can be a
different color than your face depending
if your hair is down when you're outside
I'm going to take Mac Pro Longwear
concealer in the shade NW 20 and NW 25
I'm gonna mix those two together to get
my perfect shade of concealer this is a
very full coverage concealer so I'm only
gonna do one pump each and that is going
to be more than enough for both under
eye areas the only complaint I've ever
heard about this concealer is that
sometimes it can be very drying on the
under eye area and because of that it
can kind of settle and get kind of
creepy so if you have that issue
applying a eye cream underneath the eye
area 15 minutes before you apply this
concealer can really help with that
would you take it from that inner corner
I'm going to bring it downward along the
side of my nose I'm gonna tap it up
towards my temple when I'm blend it out
with a sigma f80 6 brush and I'm going
to press that I really do not do any
sweeping because that is going to just
pull that product off of my skin I'm
gonna just press the entire time and I
always make sure that I get that inner
corner really well because if you don't
get that inner corner sometimes it can
look a little unblended and then just
blend that out I've mentioned this
before and I will mention it again this
f-86 brush is so amazing for concealer
and like I say all the time it's
technically out a concealer brush so on
the website you're not going to find it
under concealer brushes but it is what I
use for concealer and it is absolutely
amazing because it's so big and because
it's synthetic it just makes it so that
your under eye area cannot look cakey it
picks up any extra product that you've
laid on the skin and it just blends
everything out so beautifully and since
it's so big it makes the job so quick
you're not sitting there with this tiny
little brush like
like no it's very quick and easy so I'm
going to take my Anastasia contour kit
I'm gonna use that yellow banana shade
right there in the center and I'm also
going to just barely mix it with a
little bit of the Mac Mac Pro emphasized
right there these can be purchased
online on mac cosmetics calm and at pro
stores now I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows at this part I'm gonna just go
through really quickly on camera just
because however you want to fill in your
eyebrows is totally up to you as far as
the shape and everything I am gonna use
the Anastasi of Beverly Hills brow is I
use a shade ash blonde and caramel I use
ash blonde on the inner corner and then
I use caramel on the outer corner I will
list my eyebrow video down below it's
kind of long but girl I tell you
everything you would ever want to know
about my brows the trick to not making
your brows look too Bowl is not to fill
it in too much on the upper part of the
brow you can really fill it in on the
lower part to give it that dimension but
once you get up here you don't want to
press very hard if you go really light
up here that will make it look much more
natural as opposed to really like sculpt
it out okay so that's all I'm gonna do
to that brow and I will just show you
how it looks so that you can see it so
it is definitely more filled in than
this one but at the same time it's not
overdone so I will just comb that out a
little bit so now I'm gonna do is take
another flat definer brush this is a
different one that I was using before
and that concealer that's left over on
my hand from when I was doing my under
eyes I'm gonna just take a little bit on
that concealer brush and only on the
bottom part of my brow I'm going to just
line that because this will kind of
sharpen that under area up I'm not gonna
do it on top because that's when you
start looking really defined this won't
really look like I define the brow but
it will bring more attention to the eye
area and make it look a little bit more
awake and since I have shadow on I just
lightly buff that down like that I
highlight the brow bone just to pull
that whole look together and I'm going
to be using the shade mylar since this
is a bridal look typically I'll use
something like Mac shroom but today I'm
going to use mylar because this is going
to look really beautiful but much more
natural almost like a glow from within
as opposed to a shimmer I pretty much
bring it all the way in but in that
inner corner I'm really really light
handed
and then out here I will just buff it
around I always turn my brush sideways
and blend it into that shadow that I
have in that area
honestly the brow highlight just ties
everything together I always love doing
a brow highlight on anybody I've never
skipped a brow highlight on someone I
don't think just because it really ties
everything together it makes it look so
glamorous and really it makes you look
much more awake like you have more space
between the lid and the brow so now I'm
gonna finish off my eyes by doing the
lower lash line and I'm going to take
embark again on this flat definer brush
I'm gonna press it as closely as I can
to that lower lash line you can take
this as close to the inner corner as you
want I would recommend stopping right
when you get to this tear duct area
though because if you take it all the
way in you're then gonna look very smoky
and a lot of brides don't want to look
overly smoky so I stopped right when I
get to the end of where the lashes grow
okay I'm going to take creme Brule to
blend this lower lash line out
something that I have noticed with
clients so many people are scared to
blend out that lower lashline so many
people are afraid that it's gonna make
them look like they have raccoon eyes or
it's gonna make them look like they're
really tired or sleepy from my
experience that is a very rare find
blending out this little lashline
actually will open up the eyes and make
them look a little bit bigger and
rounder especially in photos it's going
to really help emphasize your eye and
make them stand and just make sure it's
seamless it's gonna take any blending
brush that doesn't have any product on
it and I'm just going to go in this
entire lower lashline area and then up
around the edge and just make sure this
is all blended one coat of mascara on
the bottom lashes and I'm using a Rimmel
lash accelerator I'm gonna do one thin
coat because I want my bottom lashes to
match my top ones and look nice and
fluffy I don't gonna be like thick or
clumpy this is gonna be really hard to
film so I probably won't be able to do
it mm-hmm
now I'm gonna move on to my face and I'm
going to be contouring i contour every
single bride because contouring will
just look beautiful in pictures and it
will really pull everything together and
again make you look very glamorous I am
going to be using a Bobbi Brown bronzing
powder in the shade golden light and I'm
also going to be using makeup geek what
is this this is the rounded blush brush
but this is my contour brush I
absolutely love it the NARS eita brush
is a great brush as well but this one is
awesome it's my newfound love I'm just
gonna take a little bit on the brush and
then cap off the excess so I'm gonna
start at the top of my ear and move
towards the corner of my mouth but I'm
not gonna come all the way to my mouth
I'm gonna stop about right here because
that's what will look the most
flattering on most people I want this
contour to be the darkest on the very
edge of my face so I really emphasize
right here as I'm working with the brush
and I only start moving forward once a
lot of the product has already been
distributed on my face
I always always take that contour on
everybody and I also just put it right
up here on the hairline I will blend
that out don't worry I'm not done with
it and I just press it right into this
hairline and then once I have that I
blend this out this is just going to
even everything out so now that we have
done our contour start my nose itches
we're going to go in with blush I am
going to be using the Mac Pro Longwear
blush and the shade rosy outlook there
Pro Longwear blushes are really great
they're supposed to last for 12 hours
so if you issues with your blushes
leaving you I would recommend to try the
Pro Longwear blushes from Mac okay so
now for my favorite part of the entire
look we are going to highlight and I'm
going to be using a new highlighting
powder that I have been waiting to show
you guys on camera for this exact look
because it is just so perfect for any
bride it is so beautiful and this is the
ambient lighting powder in the shade
luminous light this is by hourglass oh
my gosh this is the prettiest highlight
ever it should honestly just be called
Bridal because this is the perfect
highlight for a bride it is absolutely
gorgeous it looks like you are glowing
from within like you are beaming it
doesn't look like shimmer on your cheeks
I'm gonna take this and put it on the
top of the cheekbones oh it's so
beautiful it's just so soft and romantic
I really hope that the camera is picking
up how gorgeous that is because in
person it is to die for
I'm going to also take that and just put
a little bit on my chin area because it
is such a soft highlight it's really not
intense this is a highlight that you can
put on other areas of your face and I
just gonna make you look like you're
glowing but it's not gonna be that wou
highlight I am NOT going to put any
highlight on my nose because for a bride
who's gonna have pictures taken all the
time throughout the night putting any
sort of highlight on that nose can
really bring too much attention to that
nose and in photos you don't want that
much attention brought into the nose you
want it brought to the other areas of
the face I'm gonna set my brows with
anastacio brow gel this is a clear brow
gel just so that your brows do not move
at all this brow gel is amazing I used
to always be like oh my gosh please who
would buy like a high-end brow gel
that's ridiculous just use a Maybelline
once you use this brow gel you'll see
why they charge so much for it because
literally it's like super glue your
brows do not move it's amazing so to
finish off this look I'm going to do my
lips and I'm gonna do something with a
little bit of color in it I love new
lips but on your wedding day
it's really nice to have a little bit of
color on the lips just because it's
gonna look beautiful in photos and just
pull the whole lip together look
together I mean I'm gonna go in with
Urban Decay 24/7 glide on pencil in the
shade naked I don't know if these are
technically supposed to be long wearing
but they are on me they kind of feel
like glue they like adhere to the lips
and they don't move I'm gonna just line
my lips I'm not gonna over draw them
whatsoever I'm telling you now because
once I'm lining them I'm talking we'll
talk to you
okay so now I'm gonna go in with mac
prolongwear lip cream in the shade over
time this really does last a long time
on the lips and it's a really really
beautiful pink so I'm going to put a
little bit of it over top now I'm going
to take a pro long wear lip gloss by Mac
this is in the shade infinitely likable
and I'm going to just top off on the
lips with this
to finish it off I'm just gonna quickly
set my makeup by using a setting spray
I'm gonna use the Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray you can use
whichever one you want there's tons of
them out there but right now this is my
personal favorite all right you guys
that completes this makeup look I really
hope that you guys enjoy and for those
of you who are getting married
congratulations and best wishes to you I
hope that your wedding day is the most
magical thing you've ever dreamt of and
even more importantly I hope that your
marriage is the most magical thing that
you've ever dreamt of so congratulations
and good luck and make sure that you eat
a piece of cake for me because I did not
even get a piece of cake at my own
wedding
love you guys bye well that's a reaction
you look so pretty
Jordan wants to rip off my veil so good
I'm trying personally when I am doing
the foundation first a wedding day just
because you want to look perfect duh as
you can see it's really so as you can
see it
you can see just what african-themed am
said walking around is that a piece of
food in my lashes honestly make up and
put it into one there are fireworks
going off outside really okay
