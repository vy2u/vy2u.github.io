updated current foundation routine I am
filming in a different setup today so
basically I just turned my camera and
all of my equipment around so what you
would normally look at as my background
I'm now sitting at that desk facing my
window and I did this because last night
I was looking about if I'm asleep
thinking about how I offend my film my
foundation tutorial tomorrow and I was
like I wish I could do it in a way we're
like they could see the natural daylight
to actually like see my skin in the full
HD I don't know what I was thinking am I
crazy like wanting people to look at my
skin bare and full HD but whatever um so
I thought you know what I'm gonna turn
everything around so now I have my
camera my lights sitting like in front
of the window but what you are seeing
about 70% of it is natural daylight like
I have natural daylight right here and I
have two studio lights here on the side
to kind of give a little because when I
just use the natural daylight it was bad
like the side of my face was really dark
because the lights coming whatever I'm
not gonna bore you but that is why I
changed it up and I thought right I like
it when I can change up background some
kind of time and give you kind of
something else to look at because the
same thing can tend to get boring after
oh I don't know 75 videos so that right
there is a walk-in closet and in that
right there is the bathroom I'm just
telling you that because sometimes when
I watch videos I and there's like doors
in the background I'm so curious if
what's behind those doors I'm like so
scared that one's gonna like open up and
who's going to pop out at me not to
freak you out but that is a bathroom and
that is a closet I know I'm weird but
just so you know anyways the point of
this video I'm going to be doing an
updated current foundation routine the
reason I wanted to do this video for you
guys is because my foundation routine
has definitely changed a lot from what
it has been in the past and recently I
have been using a few different
techniques and I've gotten a lot of
requests for a full dedicated video on
my foundation routine so I want to go
ahead and do that for you I would really
highly recommend everything I'm going to
show you guys in this video this
technique this process to two different
people and that is either someone who is
dry skin and looking for more hydration
moisture in your daily lives and second
of all someone who is more normal dried
a combination and looking for a dewy -
glowy healthy natural looking finish as
opposed to a full matte finish or a
powdery finish this one is going to be a
more of a hydrating glow finish but at
the same time you are not going to be
looking boylee with this technique
you're just going to be looking glowy
we're not gonna go so overboard that
you're like oh my god she has been
sweating her ass off all day long I need
to take a shower we're not gonna look
oily
we're gonna look healthy so the first
step that I'm gonna do is prime my skin
I will say this is something that I used
to not believe in and I just became a
believer in primers throughout the past
year to year and a half I would say I
had never tried a primer that I actually
truly saw a difference on my skin so I
just thought like it's just a hoax like
it's not really working but you know
it's cool if you wanna spend your money
on it but recently I feel like they have
really stepped up the entire primer game
and now I have found some that truly I
see a difference on my skin and mainly
these two are my ride-or-die favorites
and this one right here is the Make Up
For Ever step one a radiant primer they
have an entire line that's amazing they
have a mattifying 100 will keep you
matte and then they have a hydrating one
they have a smoothing one this smoothie
one I absolutely love and then this one
over here this is the Becca backlight
priming filter I talked about this in my
recent favorite video so beautiful it
has a very intense luminosity in it so
if you're dry you're really looking for
a glows as gorgeous I wear this even
when I'm not wearing makeup just because
it looks so beautiful and angelic like
very Victoria's Secret model on the face
I'm going to be using the makeup forever
radiant one today just because I go back
and forth between these two because I
really do love them both and I just feel
like this one really does help prolong
my foundation and everything holds up
better and looks more natural throughout
the day as it wears and by the way make
sure when you are applying your primer
that your hands are clean it seems so
simple but for instance I wash my face
this morning that I ran 5000 errands and
I'm doing my foundation and I washed my
hands straight before I sat down to film
if you don't that's just gonna spread
bacteria very
ugly and then you can be breaking out
and have no idea why and it can be
something as simple as washing your
hands before you apply your primer I'm
actually going to apply a little bit of
the makeup forever smoothing primer as
well as it's totally unnecessary do not
need to use two primers in order to go
in with foundation but because I can
just behind me and it's when it comes to
makeup like that I'm gonna do it so I'm
gonna take a little bit of that
smoothing primer I just put it right
here because this is my problem area um
like I'll break out and sometimes get
some texture in here and I went this
morning and my skin was just not happy I
don't know what happened but I woke up
this morning my sinuses are all i
congested I have a bad headache and I
have some texture right here so I'm like
what's going on like what happened in my
sleep so apparently I had a rough night
so I'm gonna put that right here in the
center my face and then we're all good
to go in with foundation okay so for the
actual foundations I'm going to be using
today I have been using these and
non-stop recently and they are the
coverfx natural finish oil-free
foundation I do have two colors because
like I said I'm high maintenance when it
comes to makeup um no shame this is G 30
and this is G 50 so I could just buy G
40 and call it a day but G 50 is my tan
color after I have self tan G 30 is my
like oh my god
you're but white and you need to get a
tan shade so I always mix different
parts of these so today it's kind of
like 75% of G 30 and doin a Viper's edge
of G 50 because I'm pretty pale so I'm
going to take G 30 on the back of my
hand and I'm going to just squeeze it
out like that and then I'm going to take
G 50 which is the darker shade and do a
little bit less like I'm at right next
to it now I'm going to take a Beauty oil
and I'm using the blissful body miracle
Beauty oil and serum whatever Beauty oil
you have will work but this is my
absolute favorite and I'm literally
going to take one drop no joke
one drop because anymore that is gonna
be too much so just like oh one drop
that's it it will make the biggest
difference in your foundation like oh my
gosh you have no idea so now I'm going
to mix that up on the back of my hand
and
the little foundation beauty oil
cocktail if you will and now I'm going
to take whatever is on my finger and dab
it on my face
it's out of here so we can blend onto
the neck as well now a lot of times you
guys have seen me in my videos spritz
fix+
on the brush before I go in and I blend
it out when you're using a beauty oil
and your foundation or any sort of oil
you do not want to spray fix+ or any
sort of hydrating water onto your brush
to blend it out because water and oil do
not mix together you see it like in
salad dressing and you shake it up
immediately separates so what's going to
happen on your face if you use something
like fix+ on your brush and try to blend
it out your foundation will literally be
separating as you're blending it and
that's not a good look
so I'm going to be taking it the Tarte
foundation brush I don't need this
doesn't have a name it's just this Tarte
on it um I'm actually in love with the
morphe 5 and 5 3 9 brush it's called
where are you right here more feet 4 3 9
brush I have just been using this one
recently because the fact that I just
wanted to switch it up a little bit I
hadn't tried this one before and I
really really do love it but honestly if
I had to recommend one over the other I
would recommend the morphe one because
it is so amazing it's so inexpensive it
offers full coverage and it's easy to
apply the difference between this one is
it's much bigger so it covers a lot more
ground than this one it applies your
foundation a little bit more sheer but I
will say this one is actually kind of
rough on my skin as opposed to this one
which is a lot softer on the skin but I
really love them both but for like the
past two weeks I've been using yeah two
weeks right we can have I've been using
the Tarte one so that is what I'm gonna
be using today so I'm just going to go
in and begin to blend this out and
you're going to see this is not the
color of my face which is okay and that
is the way that it's supposed to be
because if you look at my neck and if
you look at my face they are like if you
look at my forehead now you look at my
neck there are two different colors so I
do not want my face foundation to be a
different color than my neck so I'm
intentionally darkening it so that it
matches my body seriously it's so thick
even with this oil it is still like like
I really make sure I blend it out and
pick up any excess cuz it is thick all
right now cover the forehead whoa look
so yellow on my white ass
I'm going to pull this mirror closer
sorry you're going to be able to see it
in the camera
you don't mind I need to see what I'm
doing a little bit better okay so now
for concealer I'm going to be using the
Urban Decay Naked weightless complete
coverage concealer this is my favorite
concealer at the moment I think it's my
favorite concealer but I've ever used I
don't even like seeing myself using
anything else I would say invent
something better so I feel like this is
just so amazing it's full coverage and
hydrating which you just don't find the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer was full
coverage but it was so drying and like a
glue and a paste this one it's just
beautiful
so I'm going to put this on the sides of
my nose bring it down here and I'm going
to swoop it towards the temple and then
I'm going to bring it down along the
side like this and then I'm going to
pull it around a nose and put it right
here on the Cupid's bow the reason I put
concealer on my Cupid's bow is because
we're some reason my foundation always
leaves my Cupid's bow I don't know why
but that's just a personal thing then
right here that is just going to help to
brighten that area and around the nose I
do that because we as women are it's
just hormones we usually get right
around here throughout the day if you'll
notice your foundation your powder
content to wear off and you can get red
right there so that's why I put the
concealer right there now I'm going to
using the Real Techniques Beauty sponge
to blend this out this is very similar
to a Beauty Blender but it's like half
the price and I think I like it even
better because it has the flat side to
it like this and you can really get up
in that eye area and blend things out
which I love I always bring my concealer
on my eyelids if I
they're like I make up already because
this is how I personally prime my eyes
I've always had my eyes using concealer
and then studying it with powder that's
just my favorite way more than using any
primer for the eyes so that's just how I
personally like to do it okay so now
that we have gone over all this many
times to make sure that it's like dry
and we've picked up the excess because
if you just tap in tap in then walk away
it'll still be kind of wet conceal
settle in fine lines so if you take the
time take the extra 30 seconds to really
continue tapping as its drying you'll
make sure that as it's drying your
sponge will pick up the excess product
so that you do not have all that
creasing happening on the under eye area
and cakiness building up so now we are
going to set everything and I'll show
you the way I've been setting things
recently that I have been loving where
is my no dome and I'm going to be using
those not right I'm going to be using
the Kat Von D shade light face palette
which looks like this this is my second
palette because I went to the first one
and I completely use every single dot of
this one I hit pan on this one and I hit
pan on this one so like it's time for
the second palette so I've recently
bought another one because these
highlighting powders are amazing so I'm
going to be using that middle yellow
shade right there and then mixing it
with that paler shade and I'm using the
morphe m4 3/8 brush which is extremely
it's the exact same thing as the Sigma
tapered highlighting brush the f-35 so
if you have either one of them they are
the exact same thing and I was going to
hit that right there and tap off the
excess and I'm going to set the
under-eye area and I always start
directly under tap this way and then tap
back in make sure if you are not rubbing
yet you can rub in a smooth motion but
not yet first you need to just set by
tapping and pouncing up and down so
start going out and back in I'm going to
bring that down in this area and put it
on the apples of cheeks I like to bring
this all over this entire area I like to
bring it all the way up to the temple
then all the way down to the corner
no so I want this entire ground right
here to be covered and set in this so
that nothing in that area moves I'm
going to take that same powder now and
I'm going to hit it on the chin because
we do not want an oily chin no matter
how doing we want our foundation to be
an oily chin it does not look good it's
one thing to have your cheeks glowing
it's another thing when like your nose
and your chin looks oily it no longer it
looks pretty and intentional it looks
like oh she needs to touch up and now
I'm going to just tap out my forehead
one more time because I have the
Brinkley's forehead in the entire world
I've had quite a few doctors and
estheticians tell me to get Botox in my
forehead for preventative reasons
because I make so many facial
expressions that my forehead has so many
premature wrinkles it is what it is I
make a lot of expressions because of
that I've tapped out the forehead area a
lot because my foundation will crease
big-time and take that same powder that
we're still on and lightly apply some
powder right there very lightly I'm not
going to put a lot of here because this
is my problem area and it will easily
crease so it's one of those things it's
like if you put just the right amount
it'll look good if you go a step too far
on you apply too much it will look bad
or I'm going to just take a little bit
on the nose very small amount because I
just don't want it to eat shiny and then
last but not least I'm just going to hit
the eyes make sure that these are these
make sure that these things are
completely covered I just don't want to
leave my lids with no powder because
again putting some powder over the lids
will make it easier for your eyeshadow
to blend and everything look even the
only areas that I didn't set was the
upper lip the bottom half of the face
and this part of the forehead everything
else I set with the highlighting powders
from the Kat Von D shade light palette
now if you have a face powder that you
love and you trust you can use that face
powder for everything I just did I
personally don't like using the face
part of those steps because I like the
fact that these bring a little bit more
light to the face after all is said and
done and I've gone and I've bronzed or
contour and blush or whatever it may be
I just feel like it gives more dimension
to the face having that area that just a
little bit lighter
than the rest of the skin I don't want
my entire face be one dimension in one
color I wanted to have different shades
different dimensions that's what's
really going to make your face look very
natural and give it a pump and just make
it look very glamorous and take your
face to the next step you know I'm
saying so you can use this method or you
can just use a regular face powder and
just put that all over your face and
that will do the exact same job it just
won't give you the three-dimensional
effect that a highlighting powder will
keep in mind these highlighting powers
have absolutely no shimmer in them
whatsoever so if you are going to be
using a highlight powder to set the
under eye area or the forehead the nose
the chin you are going to want it to be
a complete math highlighting powder so
now the next step that I'm going to do
is I'm going to set the lower half of my
face and I know that that seems so
random that I would set this part with a
highlighting powder an ominous at the
lower half of the different powder but
the reason why I do this is because
recently I have realized that my
foundation down here wears off
throughout the day because I'm like
leaning on my hand and for some reason I
hug people for some reason the lower
half of my face is just what gets
touched the most and the foundation does
kind of break up and come off so I'm
going to be using the Laura Mercier
translucent powder which I raved about
this powder is so awesome you can't see
it it's completely see-through it's
translucent and i'm using the morphe and
5 to 8 brush i believe this is from a
new collection of theirs pretty sure
it's a new collection and then i'm going
to power and then i'm going to just set
the lower half of my face and the reason
I am doing this before I go in with
bronzer or blush or anything else is
because if you have powder on powder
blends easier over powder than it does
over cream so when I apply my bronzer
next it's going to apply a lot smoother
than it would if I just went straight
over my foundation with my bronzer since
I'm putting a layer of powder in between
the bronzer and the foundation the
bronzer is going to go on much smoother
and easier this brush would actually be
really nice for contouring Oh kind of
like that idea
okay moving on so now I'm going to be
bronzing even though I know that
technically need to be involved in this
video because it's just my foundation
routine by still like I'm so flat and
one-dimensional that I need to add some
bronzer so I'm going to be using my
favorite one this is my favorite for
months now this is a makeup forever
three five one bronzer and I'm going to
be using this is the map one three five
brush I just showed this in my haul and
I have not used it yet so I'm going to
be using it right now for the first time
and I hope that I love it as much as I
think I'm going to and as much as I
loved the old one I'm so excited use
this brush that's just how I remembered
yeah
okay see right here I didn't set this
area with the translucent powder and so
the bronzer is going on a little bit
choppy and that's what happened this is
something that I have noticed so I'm
going to take a little bit of that
transfer scent powder just a tiny amount
and I'm going to just put it right there
on the sides of my forehead and then go
over with bronzer and it will go on so
much smoother ah yes much better
my hair could not could not look worse
there's nothing that I could do at this
point to make it worse honestly like
it's at its ultimate ugly capacity
okay let's throw in a little bit of
blush okay what is happening this is
turning it's like a full entire tutorial
I know that's gonna be my foundation
routine I need some blush though I look
so bad okay I'm going to be using the
Tarte look at how bad up this palette is
like this so cool I love it tarts
holiday blush palettes he doesn't make
everyone so far all right this is called
the bling it on palette the Amazonian
clay blush palette it looks like this oh
so pretty I'm going to mix these two
pinks I think I haven't done a pink
cheek in a while so I'm gonna mix doll
face and smashing this is my first time
using this palette so oh yes nice and
pigmented yes no one on my palette is so
nice oh and I'm using the morphe e-4
brush to apply this in case I don't tell
you but you should know by now because
oh my gosh I use this brush way too much
it's my favorite okay why do my cheeks
look like Bozo the Clown pink on camera
and I realize they look like just a hint
of blush just a hint and on camera it's
like in the mirror it's like okay I
don't know what's going on there now
since I've done like my blush and my
bronzer I said I need to add some
highlight really quickly because let's
get real like I can't leave that I can't
do anything about highlights so I'm
going to tie the tops of my cheekbones
really quickly and I'm going to be using
the Becca champagne glow palette that
comes out this what does it come out of
my gosh Satan comes out on the 27th of
October it looks like this inside it has
blush copper champagne pop and pearl
which are all three of them too in
addition I'm going to be mixing
champagne pop and pearl together to
create a much lighter version of
champagne pop I'm going to apply that
just on the tops of the cheekbones I
love pearls so much I want them to make
it permanent it's so gorgeous
now we are going to set everything I'm
going to be using the Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray exact rabies in
amount of it and sometimes I will go
back in with a second layer of that
spray just depending how powdery I feel
the point of a makeup spray is that it
will really help the powder that you put
on the skin not look as powdery and kind
of combine the foundation and the powers
together so that everything lays it
looks a little bit more natural as
opposed to looking like layers of things
sitting on your skin if you're really
looking for a dewy effect I would do the
mac fix+ and if you're looking for
something this very Jimmy the ultimate
doofus is the tatcha luminous dewy skin
this and look that's hello I am that's
how much I love this product I love it I
will actually spread a little bit at the
tachi one more just provided alright you
guys so that completes my current
foundation routine for the fall / winter
months even though I would totally do
this in the summer time because I'm just
dry like that and so I will totally add
oil to my foundation year round but my
favorite thing about adding the oil to
my foundation is the fact that if you
just add the oil into a already dewy
foundation your going to look oily
throughout the day that's just fat you
might like that
that's totally personal preference but
we went in and we covered up all of the
foundation and the oil with a powder so
even though we have that oily creamy
base we covered it up with a matte
finish so it's like matte powder with
oily base underneath and when those two
collide it just makes a really pretty
kind of flawless natural looking
foundation so I absolutely love this
technique I will be using this
throughout the entire winter I'm sure
for the rest of my life so I hope that
you guys enjoy this as well and if you
are oily do not be afraid to try this I
know so many people are so scared when
you're oily you don't have oil on your
skin but remember the oil combat oils so
if your skin is excessively oily you may
want to try using an oil at night before
you go to bed or maybe a touch in your
foundation because it could mean that
your body actually knew
more oil and that is why it's over
producing it so don't be afraid to give
it a shot someday you know don't try it
before prom or your wedding day on a
special occasion but you know just like
a Tuesday give it a shot and see how it
works so I hope that you guys enjoy this
I'm going to stop talking now I know
this has been such a long video I'm
sorry you guys I hope that you enjoy
thank you so much for watching I love
you and I'll see you soon
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
