even know how to film an intro anymore I
forgot how to do it well I can't get my
words out hey guys welcome back to my
channel I think I could throw up right
now
I could like easily throw up oh thank
god just a burp oh those are risky ones
let's jump into like the actual
situation ahh humming I like so Gideon
nervous
so Murphy and I both posted our like
little teaser video clip today on
Instagram and there's been so many
comments of people being like another
collaboration with morphe what's this
one gonna be you already had your
Jacqueline Hill palette
well you're onto something so a year ago
morphe and i released this palette right
here called the Jaclyn hill palette and
as you guys know because I made it very
clear because it was such a long process
this took us a little over two years to
develop and I told you guys several
times when talking about this palette
that while we were creating and
developing those shadows I actually came
up with about around give or take a
hundred different shades for this
palette and because it is only a
thirty-five color palette and we knew
from the very beginning that we were
gonna keep it 35 colors I had to narrow
that down to this right here so the
collection I am now launching with
morphe one year later are all of the
other shadows that were kept in the Volt
so after we launched my palette and we
saw what a success it was I was like oh
my god I wish they could have seen all
the other shades I have because they're
so beautiful and narrowing it down was
so difficult for me because I had so
many amazing shades and Linda was like
let's release those too so we kind of
like sat around like tinker with that
idea for like a month we're like should
we really submit individual pans should
we release the Jaclyn hill palette again
and make it like magnetic and then you
can like pop them in and out and change
them out like we didn't know we like
went back and forth with all these ideas
talking about it every day
and finally we landed on this so after
we came up with this idea I jumped on a
plane and flew to LA spent a couple of
days in the morphe office and we pulled
all of the shades that I created and
formulated for the Jaclyn hill palette
that didn't actually get put into the
palette and I sat there and I said this
one this one this one this one this one
this one and we put it together in two
different color categories we broke it
down there were a few others
didn't make it and then there were a few
shades I also add it I was like okay
this color story is almost perfect but
it's missing this one color it's missing
this one finish so we would add it in so
you know what I'm saying like we
compiled everything together and then
made it even better that way like it
makes sense and it's a great story and
they are great palettes so this right
here is 40 additional eyeshadows is the
same formulation press the same way same
pigmentation as the Jacqueline Hill
palette which we all know and hopefully
we all love it's just so exciting
because as you guys know my formula is
not the same as the morphe standard
eyeshadow formula linda was so kind to
allow me to develop my own formula with
them and have it pressed in my own
unique way so that it goes on completely
differently than their other eyeshadows
so it's super exciting that these are
the exact same formula as this palette
that I tear so if you like this palette
it's the same thing just different
colors so when I first started posting
some videos of the swatches of these
shades on my arm there were some people
saying oh that looks just like the
Jaclyn hill palette it's the exact same
thing why should doing the exact same
thing well it's not the exact same thing
I promise you but there are going to be
similar shades like there is a palette
here there's all warm tones and there's
also a row in my palette that's warm
tones like an extension it's like the
hot older sister to my palette if you
will like it complements my palette this
right here is the packaging you see the
all white shiny box it says more feet
I'm Jacqueline Hill and then on the back
there is this big picture of me looks
like I'm screaming at you to go use my
discount code honestly like it should
just have like a bubble it says use
Kojak attack and all caps Linda actually
surprised me with this photo on the box
I had no idea that there was even gonna
be a picture of me in the box and this
showed up to my house and I was like
what the and she was like it's my
favorite picture of you it was okay
great well that's all Linda but I like
it okay so let's jump into the inside of
the box you can see so this is the
actual vault collection that you have
right here it comes in a sift cardboard
and then it has like a little thing that
you pull and it pulls out the four
pallets like these and then the thing
that I was really excited that we came
up with when we were dealing with like
the creative aspect is every single
pallet has a name along with a theme and
the actual pallet name has the color
that like is associated to the colors in
the palette so
is the green one this is like the yellow
one this is the purple and then this is
the red so if you have this laying out
on your dresser you're not gonna be it
having to go through each one like Oh
which one do I need on the front of the
pallets you see there's like that little
like metallic explosion there's also
that same color story in there so you
can see like green dots yellow dots
purple dots and red dots like confetti
so you never have to like feel like Oh
which one is it like you notice by
looking at it so a really exciting thing
for me is on the inside of the palette
we have a mirror when we launched my
original palette that was one of the
biggest pieces of feedback that we got
and biggest complaints where people wish
there was a mirror in the palette but we
couldn't have done that we wanted to
even when it was repackaged we were like
oh we wanted a mirror we tried to we got
some samples it was not gonna work
because of the price to put like a big
mirror not palette it was we would have
to jack up the price I didn't want to do
that
linen wouldn't do that so just then it
happened where would these we were able
to keep the price low it is a smaller
mirror and a smaller palette with ten
shadows same formulation again as the
original Jaclyn hill palette with a
mirror and this is 15 dollars which I
have to say I am so damn proud of this
in that price point I can't even begin
to tell you how excited this makes me
and I have personally had the Volk
collection in my hands for several
months I've traveled with it several
times and I freaking love the fact that
it has a mirror like when everyone was
asking for a mirror and my palette I was
like why like it's so big but I wouldn't
want a mirror like that like I don't
really get it but with these I'm like oh
bitch I get it now so this powder right
here that I just showed you guys this is
called ringing the alarm and this is our
all warm tone money this palette makes
me feel some type of way and then all
the names are actually great there on
the front because again you guys wanted
names on the original Jaclyn hill
palette and we were not able to do that
with this collection we were able to
take all your feedback and actually
implement it so it's very exciting I'm
just excited I'm such a good place okay
I've it into place so this is our purple
themed palette right here this color
rockstar in the center obsessed and this
one right here this was a
little biatch but it is one of my
absolute favorite shades of all time I'm
not just saying in my collection I'm
saying all time it is such a beautiful
satin with metallic glitter in it it's
just like it's perfect and then the
third palette is what I refer to as the
yellow palette so you'll see like in the
marketing campaign there's like a purple
theme a red theme a yellow theme and
like a greenish blue theme and that goes
off of every single palette so this one
right here I chose to make it the yellow
theme because when I look at this I just
think of like the outdoors like there's
something about me think of like
sunshine and grass and just like beachy
and summery like I love these colors
this shade coin right here is another
one of my favorites in the entire
collection it's so much how I can so
foiled and just like such a pop in this
army green down here and then last but
not least this is Linda's favorite
palette I keep going back and forth like
one month I'm like this is my favorite
and that's one of my favorite but this
is a good-ass palette so this is dark
magic and this definitely has just like
that's sexual just like late night date
night vibe like I'm in it in power cut
right here this metallic silver is so
beautiful like in these three shades
right here of this bottom row like these
blues and that green like so this black
right here you guys no joke probably the
best black eyeshadow I've ever used in
my entire life when we got that down I
wanted to cry I was like we're done I
would pay probably $30 just for that one
I shut it right there because it is the
perfect black if you ask me I honestly
like I don't even want to like overhyped
this collection up like I want this
video to be so short and sweet even
though it's probably gonna be 45 minutes
long cuz I don't want to sit here and be
like it's so amazing it's so creamy it's
so buttery it's so pigmented it could be
yours right now for $49 it's like I
don't want to do that because it's just
so good it's like once you get it once
you go swatch it once you have it for
yourself like the proof is in the
pudding
that's all I'm saying but use my code I
will hype that up code Jack Attack all
caps
I haven't promoted that in a while I
actually was thinking about it a couple
weeks ago and I was like how they have
even mentioned my code on social media
and like at least six months I might be
wrong if I'm wrong you can check me but
seriously though my code Jack Attack
and all caps will save you an additional
10% on this entire collection whether
you purchase it individual or as the
vault collection that code will save you
10% on anything more fee so more food
calm and any more feast or you can use
that code and store the cash register
just say I want to use code Jack Attack
and they will go ahead and type it in
and you will save 10% on everything in
the more feed store all right let's jump
into the swatches watches okay because I
feel like I have anything else to say so
let's start off by swatching reading the
alarm okay first shape we have is lolly
oh I forgot how good my formula was for
a minute Oh hate that max never swatch
as good as shimmers I hate it like it
does not matter what brand is a never
song is good they can't they don't have
as much oil in them but still it's
annoying that guy want a map to swatch
just like that the next sheet is this
gorgeous like tangerine matte orange
it's just so good
next we have on camera which is ah this
gorgeous gold I'm wearing this on my
eyes right now sorry sometimes I like go
back and forth back and forth I know a
lot you guys like it wanted to do that
one swatch but I think it looks prettier
when it's like dragged out like this
so you can like see what it looks like
when you're actually people ending it on
the eye now we have the shade boom which
is a copper oh this is a metallic shim
this is good now we have the shade alert
I'm obsessed with the shade this is a
matte orange like a true like pumpkin
orange Oh mommy now we have the shade
bomb-ass which is a shimmer and this is
like a metallic pink cranberry right
there as you can see then with the
shades siren and this shade is like
really special to me that sounds so
silly but it is like special to me
because of the fact that it's not a full
matte and it's not a full shimmer it's a
beautiful set and it has little little
flecks of shimmer in it so it makes it
like really creamy and like easy to
apply it applies differently than any of
the other shadows in this palette and
it's just such a pretty like purpley
burgundy shade next we have the
most-used I shadow in the entire
collection for me personally and this is
the shade mugshot it is the most
beautiful just like poopie pukey yellow
undertone Brown you
ever seen then we have the shade framed
which was a little beeyotch to get this
formulation because the fact that
purples are so hard to develop this was
not an easy one for us at all but we
finally got it down and let me tell you
what I swatch us and compared it to
every single purple that I had in my
eyeshadow collection and I ordered other
purples I didn't own from other brands
that I was like let's see I was so
scared that it wasn't gonna be good
enough i swatched it and I was like okay
and then last but most certainly not
least in this palette we have the shade
of secret which is like a beautiful
fudgy chocolaty matte brown and that
looks like that honey that pigment
honestly that could get me off so
there's the full ring the alarm palette
for you okay so now let's swatch armed
and gorgeous so the first shade VIP is a
white ass white like shimmer white so
you can use this as an inner corner
highlight you can use this as a
cheekbone highlight you can use this all
over the lid very frosty very metallic
and very white next we have the shade
access which is like an amazing creamy
matte mustard yellow now we had the
shade guilt-trip which is like a muted
more pale gold as opposed to on-camera
from the ring the alarm palette looks
like a BAM and your face gold that I'm
wearing on my eyes this one is a little
bit more pale and subtle it honestly
just looks like pure sunshine one of my
favorite colors right here which is
called coin and this one is like such an
awesome metallic like greeny yellow look
at it like uh then we have the shade
agent which is like this muted kind of
like orange caramel shade and this is a
matte as well Oh every single shade that
I swatch them I come himself SACEM so
obsessed but like I am like I love all
of these so much like my little babies
now we have the matte army green which
is in the shade top secrets looks like
nice and I tear let me blend out for you
I was trying to you like one swatch I
just don't like it you guys I like it
when it's like nice and smooth now with
the shades smooth criminal' which is a
super super super warm
like orangie reddish matte brown looks
like that then we have the shade secret
which is another orange it's just a
completely different tone than access
and agent secret is definitely way more
vibrant as you can see right there and
we kind of blend it out for you it's
like in your face BAM Orange
then we have the shade prowl which is a
cool tone matte Brown because I know
that people need their cool tone mattes
so I give you a cool tone brown and then
the last shade in this palette is
classified which is very very metallic
this is more like a foiled shadow I
would definitely recommend going in with
some fixed plus or something sticky when
you're applying this otherwise it's not
gonna live its best life on your Liddy's
it's very very glittery and shimmery but
it's beautiful when it's wet so there is
the full arm and gorgeous palette for
you okay now let's move on to bowling
boss which is the purple palettes first
shade that we have is bling bling this
is like a lilac kind of shimmery pinky
purple taupe it's just one of those good
colors every collection and every
palette basically needs cuz it's so
flattering and Sony different skin tones
then we have the shade hush hush this
was actually difficult for me to put in
here which is why it didn't make it into
the first palette that we did because it
is a matte cool tone taupey purple I
know that people love this color but
it's not a color I personally wear very
often but it is a great color for your
transition area when you are doing that
a purple or a pinky look so I was like I
have to incorporate it my sister loves
these colors and she was a you don't put
that damn color in this palette so if
you guys end up loving this color thank
my sister next we have the shade Jen
which is this bright ass metallic purple
which I I love this because I love a
good pop of color especially the lower
lash it's so creamy this one just like
came out like a dream we had the shade
pizazz which is a pinky kind of purple
cranberry so pretty we have the shade
mystic which is a cool tone deep brown
with purple undertones in it so creamy
like oh love we have the shade sparks
which as you can tell by the name this
is a matte red it's got
a little bit like a cranberry undertone
in it like it's not red red I'm not
gonna go too in depth and board you guys
with why it's so difficult to do a red
red it's very complex but this one right
here was like the creamiest and most
vibrant red that we could get and love
it now we have the shade glitz and glam
which is a really really pretty kind of
like it's hard to explain it's like a
golden beige with taupe in it and it has
like little flecks of glitter it's so
pretty and this is more of a neutral
shimmer as opposed to the other ones I
have a lot of warm shores in this
palette this is definitely more of a
neutral add the shade Rockstar which is
a matte beautiful purple like this
purple is everything to me like this is
so gorgeous then we the shape ballsy
which is a cool tone lilac purple with
gold undertones
it is so freakin beautiful I cannot even
begin and then last but bitch not least
is the shade buried treasure buried
treasure is one of the coolest shades to
me in the world
first of all just touching it it's like
it just doesn't even feel like a shadow
like a normal eye shell I don't explain
it feels like you're touching like silk
you'll see once you have it like it's
it's like touching silk I don't even see
that swatch of my finger just the way it
looks it's got so much shimmer in it but
like the shimmer doesn't fall out the
shimmer was pressed in with the black
pigments so it's got this purple pink
glistening glitter shimmer along with
this like pigmented black like it is
just so unique and so beautiful so that
right there is all ten shades from bling
boss can you guys see that bury treasure
color up close and see what I'm talking
about like all that sparkle in there
like all right last palette in the
collection is dark magic this palette is
so beautiful and I think it is so unique
and just versatile like I love this
palette so the first chance gonna let
you know what basically doesn't show up
on my skin tone so just be aware like to
me this first shade poof is basically
what I use all
before I go in with an eye shadow look
it's not gonna show up on me I'll show
you like you can barely even see it it's
like just a little a little bit of a
peach undertone on it you can kind of
see who we swatched on other skin tones
where you actually can see and I promise
the pigmentation is good it's a good
shade it just like doesn't show up on my
skintone at all it's a way to close
again this is one of my favorite colors
in the entire collection this is in the
shade power cut it is such a beautiful
foiled very metallic silver and it's a
neutral silver so like it's not super
warm or super cool it's just perfect
then we have this shade which is a matte
cool tone Brown I made this for the
transition area of the eye then we have
the shade trickery which is such a
beautiful shimmery green this green to
me is just so different than any other
green I have seen that rhymed like it
just doesn't have any undertones and
anything that doesn't have gold in it
doesn't have blue in it it's just such a
true beautiful metallic green I love
this color
then we the shade divergent which is
like a genuine shimmer Toby Brown so
pretty now we have potion which is a
matte army green and you guys know I am
into this color they made this shade
busted which is a matte deep blue I
think the shade is so unique it's so
different and I'm gonna be honest I hate
the way these swatch this is the thing
that no one ever talks about and it
makes me crazy like I watch people
myself included squash things on camera
and you're like oh it's so beautiful but
the swatches don't look that good you're
just kind of like my problem is it's
beautiful like it makes you
uncomfortable like I'm telling you these
swatches drive me a little crazy because
they're not the same as when you
actually apply them to the eye and
that's what makes me crazy about
squatches like I want to see it actually
apply it on the lid because that's what
matters the end the day I'm nots
watching the show my arm I'm wearing it
but I was a psychopath about this blue
right here I actually worked very hard
on this in the past year because it just
wasn't right and then I ordered tons of
Blues from tons of different brands
there were all mattes and I compared it
and this was the best one that I swatch
so I was like okay we're in a good place
moving on now we're the shade inside job
which is a matte very dark kind of like
turi green but it's got like a hint of
blue in it but not too much blue it's
more green than blue but it's very
different then we have mojo which is a
matte very very dark cool tone brown and
this one is really really creamy like
the way it applies it's just beautiful
and then last and the entire collection
is what I personally think is the best
black I've ever used in my life is in
the shade temptress what makes this so
unique is it has a little bit of sparkle
in it but like it's not the kind of
sparkle like glitter it's not gonna have
fallout but it's just such a small
amount that you'll never actually see on
the eye but it makes it easier to blend
and we were able to put more oil in this
one so it is like jet jet black this to
me is like the color of like ink it's so
beautiful and there we have dark magic
so that's it you guys like I don't know
how to outro this video just like I
didn't know how to intro this video but
I am just so excited I'm so grateful and
