didn't have time to fill a video in the
next few days but it just so happens
that my husband woke up sick this
morning so I've been hanging around the
house all day long playing doctor and I
have some time I figured why not film a
video really quick even there's no such
thing as filming a video really quick in
my mind I'm like it's gonna be fast and
then for I was like oh my god
anyways so I figured I'll go ahead and
do my January favorites I will be doing
makeup tutorials later this week but for
now this is easy so I figured why not do
it um good news is my lighting is
getting better we're working our way
there we're working bad news is I don't
have time to do my hair so can you just
love me through it okay so let's just
get started I feel like I have like half
makeup and half skincare step done a lot
of skincare shopping the past month and
a half so I'm going to just start off
with makeup the first thing I really
hope that this isn't sold out everywhere
but I have to talk about it because I've
loved it all month long and is from the
magnetic nude collection that MAC
Cosmetics came out with in the beginning
of January and this is an extra
dimension skin finish in the shade
magnetic appeal it is this gorgeous
gorgeous rose gold with a little bit of
copper in it and this is made to go on
the cheekbones over the blush or use as
a blush as a highlight it is so
beautiful it is so warm it's so
complimentary to so many different skin
tones it's just gorgeous and I love that
it's not just like a straight gold but
it's got like some copper and some rose
in there as well it is so pretty I've
been putting it on like every single day
over whatever blush I choose to wear
which is what I did today
I wear a matte blush and then I'll just
lightly sweep this over top I know this
is sold out online and I have no idea
about all of your starting cars and
stores but if you had the chance to get
magnetic appeal Oh gorgeous couple of
weeks ago I went to Target and I got a
little drugstore makeup crazy-long their
purchase a few things and one of the
things that I've been loving is the
Maybelline Line stiletto and this is the
ultimate precision liquid liner and I
love how small it is and it's just so
easy to maneuver I like how its got like
a short but yet like thick stubby handle
and then it's right there some miners
will like come all the way out to here
and it's like a so awkward this is so so
easy to use and I don't use liquid liner
on a day-to-day basis if you watch my
videos you know that I use a gel with a
precision little small angle brush but I
use liquid liner just to go over my
eyeliner like before I leave the house
or after I wear my makeup for a period
of time just because if you're working
with pigments or glitters we're sick any
thick shadow it can tend to fall down on
your black liner and I'm so picky about
my liner being perfect that I will run
over it super quick quick with a liquid
instead of like the whole process again
just to ensure that it's black and
straight I don't have powder or pigment
like hanging out all over it that's just
me I'm so picky I'm so crazy no big deal
a couple other products that I got at
the drugstore I have been obsessed with
all month long are these Maybelline lip
colors they are called the elixir color
sensational collection I actually love
them I think I have one or two more but
these three are the ones that I have
been obsessing over the most they are in
the shade nude illusion pedal pusher and
captivating carnation absolutely love
them I have on pedal pusher right now on
top of hope I don't know like 1600
things I just love these they don't
really even feel like an actual lip
gloss they feel more like a lip butter
they're so creamy they go on so smooth
they got this nice little short handle
to apply what I just absolutely love
these they have great pigmentation this
nude one nude illusion is so pretty you
know I love my news they're just they're
so creamy I mean you could put this on
with no makeup on and it would still
just feel like you're wearing like a lip
butter they don't feel sticky at all I
just these are some of my favorite lip
products like of all time at the moment
it'll change this month see what other
lip products by Maybelline this month
they came out with this nude collection
I don't even know what the name of this
new collection was but it was like 10 or
15 all different shades of nude for all
different skin tones I actually love
them I think
are just four of them and these are just
two that I have right here but I've been
using them a lot so I have to say the
one downside to these is they don't have
tons of staying power but they are so
pretty which is not a big deal to me
that they don't have staying power as
long as they go on nice and smooth and
they don't break up on your lips and
start looking like chunky throughout the
day that's all that really matters to me
so that one I just showed you is nude
lust and then this one is blushing beige
and I love the packaging I love that
it's in this new little capsule and
they're just such pretty colors and
they're gorgeous news so I am super
super excited about these I don't know
how this question is going to be out for
and I don't even know the name of the
collection but as always all the
information I'm talking about right now
I will list everything down below my
description bar laughs lip products I
quickly mention this in my IMATS haul
video is the dose of color lip gloss in
the shade I'm dressed stop what you're
doing and go buy this lip gloss it is so
beautiful and when I first saw it I was
like oh that's gonna be too dark on me I
don't know why like in person it looked
a little too Brown because I am pretty
fair right now especially for the color
that I usually am um no it's perfect
it's absolutely gorgeous if you guys
haven't tried dose of color I highly
highly suggest that you do they're so
pigmented I literally just like the
tiniest swatch I'll show you like so
pigmented and I don't really feel like a
gloss it's very hard to explain the
texture but it almost feels more like a
mousse in a bottle or like a stain not a
glossy glossy it doesn't look like shiny
when you're wearing it but yet it does
have shine does that make sense no not
whatsoever
this product I absolutely love but at
the same time I'm kind of like about at
the same time I don't know if that makes
sense but it is the NARS Pro Prime
instant line and pore Perfector it's so
tiny and cute I love it so it just rolls
up like this almost like a concealer
stick and all you do is just rub it
around
the areas of like pore perfecting and
lime filling so just those problematic
areas
one has it in between the eyebrows right
here with the smile lines and then where
you have your largest of course which is
usually your t-zone area absolutely love
this it works your foundation goes on
over top of it beautifully it sticks to
it doesn't slide off like a lot of times
it does sometimes products like this it
is great the one downside for me
personally is that it keeps me matte all
day long but I am a dry person but I
still have a little bit of natural oil
this there's no oil coming through so
for you Olli monsters you will actually
love this product because oil is not
going to break through this thing that
is why I am so mad today I don't know if
you can tell a difference on camera as
you can in person but I am extremely mad
say because I did use this before but it
works so well for filling in lines and
covering up pores it makes you look so
like airbrush even when you try on the
back of your hand you'll see your lines
just disappear it it's a great product
but once again keeps you super matte
okay I have three products mentioned by
anastasiya of rolling hills and the
first one is the Oh contour kits oh my
gosh seriously when I saw that this was
coming out I was just like took my idea
I just right out of my mind I've always
felt like there needs to be an amazing
contour and highlighting kit out there
on the market and I've never ever found
one that is just on point that has it
all and this one pretty much has that it
looks like this you've got six little
baby colors in here I love them the
three bottom are contour shades and a
three top are highlight shape absolutely
gorgeous so right here you have a good
pinky beige color for highlighting this
is a yellowy base or why not yellowy
it's yellow and then this right here is
a little bit of shimmer it's like a
vanilla base shade this shimmer is very
fine it is not a chunky glitter or
highlight whatsoever and you can see how
it looks it's a little more powdery as
opposed to shimmery oh I don't even know
if you can see
the light but it's not like an intense
shimmer at all it's very very natural
highlights so for somebody who does a
lot like an intense highlight for
someone who's maybe a little bit more
mature we would love this kit by
lighting um it's got three four contour
shades that are great for all different
skin tones for me I am this darker
caramel one right here all the way to
the left well yeah
love to left me right here nothing of
course you have these other two shades
you they're going to be great for other
people with other skin tones like
someone was a little bit more pink in
their skin tone and someone who is a
little bit dark II darker with a little
bit more like ash and their skin it's
universal it's great and I I love it I
am using this today for all of my
contour and highlighting along with
blush this is the dip brow pomade by
anastasia and this product came out like
i don't know two three months ago
something like that not that long ago
it's fairly new and it looks like this
it almost looks like an eyeliner but it
is the hardest texture to explain like a
pomade it is so awesome i have not heard
that many reviews on it so i just tried
out for myself i am using the shape burn
this is what eight i use to fill my
brows today but i also use a couple of
other things because I was like
experimenting as I was doing my makeup
so they might look a little janky but
that's okay um I absolutely love this
it's so easy to use it is like a makeup
artists dream it's so easy to blend so
creamy it's like almost Lucy I've used
that word twice now in this video it
just it's a great great product for
everyday makeup wares I don't know if
this is something that you would love I
do know from a makeup artist standpoint
I absolutely adore it it is so easy it
comes time in half filling in my brows
it was just like shhh wink I absolutely
loved it so dip brow pomade and I am
using the shade Auburn but that's going
to change because my hair is going to
change last products by Anastacio this
is the tinted brow gel in the shade
brunette so I don't know if you guys are
familiar with tinted brow gels but
they're really great especially for
people who don't know how to fill their
eyebrows you can get into brow gel and
just do nothing but just comb this
through your brow like a mascara wand
and just make sure that you don't push
hard because if you push hard and
touches your skin a lot it can look
really unnatural but if you lightly
graze your brows it looks
nice coat and it'll just make it look
supernatural a little bit thicker more
full so so pretty so after I do my brows
I will go in and just lightly slip this
through and it'll just make it look more
natural a bit more dimension and so
they're not so flat so I've really been
liking this into brow gel before I go on
to my skincare products I'm going to
quickly break it up by mentioning this
perfume that I've been in love with and
it is the original Chloe perfume I did
get it in the rollerball just because
I've so many bottles of perfume and I'm
like I get sick of them and just like
stopped using them before I even finish
the bottle and I don't touch them for
six months so I figured why not do a
rollerball and take it with me
everywhere so I just I just discovered
the scent I absolutely love it and it's
fresh it's timeless and I personally
like very clean fresh scents that smell
almost like you just did laundry um it's
not like spring I don't like anything
like musky and really warm I like things
very clean and crisp
so I'm always nervous telling you guys
not sense that I wear cuz I'm like
they're gonna go smell it and be like oh
my god she stinks so bad okay another
total Rando and I think I have mentioned
this guy before but this is the healthy
deodorant by law
vanilla laboratories you can get this at
Sephora and it is an all-natural
deodorant in the scent is lemon vanilla
oh for those of you who have a hard time
finding Dorota to like like I do I am so
picky when we were in LA I forgot this
and I use my sister's deodorant which
was just like secret or something like
those popular brands and I had to
immediately wash it off because I cannot
stand the scent of like baby powder
deodorant it grosses me out but this one
smells like perfume and I loved these
next two products I was literally
counting down the days until they
released they did release on two
separate days but I was so excited to
get both of them and I have literally
been waiting to talk to you guys about
all month long I was thinking about
incorporating them in at my skincare
favorites of 2013 but I was like that's
not fair because I only owned them for a
week but I am officially obsessed and
now I can scream it on the rooftops the
first one is the glam glow thirsty
hydrating treatment if you guys okay my
hair is a little please like honestly
like that's the real issue I'm sure you
guys know who glam glow is I've talked
about my little Q times here on my
channel and they are known for their mud
masks which are really known for
clarifying the skin going and deep
penetrating and pulling stuff out to the
surface and really helping with acne and
oils and stuff like that this is
basically the opposite but in a good way
instead of going in deep and pulling
stuff out this is going to go in deep
and hydrate it's going to give you such
a beautiful glow radiant skin it
literally just feels like butter but an
amazing non clogging your pores kind of
way it is such an amazing mask it looks
like this it is it smells amazing
there's nothing bad to say about this
product I have used it all month long
ever since the day it came out literally
I absolutely love this it is going to do
everything that you want a mouse to do
even oily people will like this mask
it's awesome and I will say so the first
time I use this earlier that day I use
this is like so messed up I was
squeezing it so hard earlier that day I
used the million dollar tan Cabana face
extreme which is a sunless tanner made
for your face and then when I went to
Sephora and bought this it came home
that night wash my face apply this and
the next morning I woke up my husband
literally leaned over to me and was like
your skin looks so beautiful and I'm
like okay like what a random compliment
to get from your husband like what I
jumped out of bed and ran to the mirror
I was like oh my gosh and I'm telling
you it the mixture of using a sunless
tanner product on your face with this
glam glow thirsty my mask was just like
end-all-be-all
perfection I'm not joking I've never
seen my skin look so beautiful in my
life so now I'm obsessed with using this
is it during the day and I'm using this
at night because it's like you get that
sunny like sunkissed glow plus the
hydration it's perfect absolutely
beautiful so they're like my match made
in heaven right now
yeah I love it go buy the masks you will
thank me and you won't regret it
these second products that I have been
obsessing over all month long is the
Josie Maran milk intensive hydrating
treatment oh my gosh obsessed so I
ordered this online because it was
available at my Sephora for like five
days until after it release don't ask
I'm literally that crazy I was so
excited to try this you guys know I
actually love her products more than
anything in the world so this is
basically purified water plus her
original argan oil mixed together I know
that sounds a little crazy but that's
what it is and it is this beautiful
milky consistency it's got this little
dropper just like her original oils and
when I first saw it I thought okay so
it's a hydrating treatment I'm going to
have to use it at night time so I
originally start using at night time
along with my beauty oils and loved it
but then I start realizing that I could
use it during the day as well now on
days I'm not wearing makeup I like to
use a very very light moisturizer
because not only am i dry I'm extremely
sensitive so I wear anything thick
during the day without applying makeup
it clogs my pores don't ask why
it just happens I break out my skin
doesn't like it so I started using this
on days when I am applying makeup and it
works beautifully as base absol
beautiful e so this is going to
penetrate once again very deeply improve
radiance glow it also helps with
firmness of the skin it's just an
all-around amazing product I'm super
sensitive it hasn't irritated me at all
absolute love it morning and night this
in the thirsty mud obsessed and
especially this time of year it's the
perfect time to get products like this
because we're in those cold chilly dry
months okay I'm done I love these
products I also mention these in my
Sephora haul on towards the beginning of
the month and it is the Paracon MD blue
Plaza this is an everyday basically
chemical peel without any chemicals in
it it is amazing like oh my gosh my skin
has never in my life felt so soft it's a
freaky how soft it makes your skin feel
it is amazing and it truly helps with
brightness and radiance norsu bleah so
I'm going to put that down
not rambling again the next one is again
I mentioned this in my whole the
Perricone MD deep moisture therapy Oh
amazing once again I do not like to use
thick moisturizers during the day and
this one definitely looks thick it it
looks thick and I'm like digging in the
exact same area like scooping up anyway
it does not feel thick when you rub it
on your skin it feels super thick and
then it just evaporates it is so amazing
I wear these both with and without
makeup on top I actually love them so
for you dry skin to combination skin
people out there this is worth the
investment
I'm truly seeing a difference in my skin
and I can't say anything but good things
about it last two products this right
here is brand new and I'll use it twice
and this is the happy hippie shower gel
by lush absolutely love this I was in
there talking about how much I love
fresh scents and the girl was like have
you tried this and I was like no and she
was like you need it and I was like yes
it's it's just like it just smells like
nothing but citrus is so amazing smell
like citrus oranges and lemons is what
it smells like it is absolutely amazing
whenever I shower and I use it I'm just
like it is so refreshing so I've been
loving that happy hippie happy hippie I
just want to talk about it cuz it's such
a happy hippie last but not least is
again by lush the caramel cream hand and
body lotion this takes the cake for
lotions in winter 2014 I am so picky
about body butters and body lotions and
this one is the best I absolutely love
it it has almond oil and cocoa butter in
it and it smells amazing again it's like
fresh and not too warm but not too cool
and scent it's perfect and you can see
I've been I've been getting my use out
of it I absolutely love it but I've been
using it every single night after I
shower it's so creamy it feels more like
a butter than a lotion to me but it
absorbs fast so you don't feel greasy
which is obviously important to us so
yes okay that is it for my January
favorites I really hope that you guys
enjoy I'm still
working on the iPhone here I'm still
working on the background in here but my
lighting is starting to get better right
