my January favorites and this is the
most random favorites video I've ever
done hands down since I've started
YouTube I have everything for you guys
today I have makeup I have skincare I
have hair products I have food I have
everything so this is going to be
extremely random but I was out of town
for two weeks this month so I definitely
didn't feel like it wasn't my normal
life my normal routine so I feel like
that's why my favorites are kind of all
over the place you know what I am okay
I'm gonna try to get through this
send me quickly because it is so hot in
here my a/c is still not fixed a guy was
supposed to come fix it today but he
just didn't show up and I have a feeling
it's because of Gasparilla if you guys
aren't familiar Gasparilla is a huge
parade that takes place in Tampa Florida
and it happens once a year and today was
the day parade so basically pirates
invade Bayshore and they come in on a
pirate ship and cannons go off and it's
like 50,000 drunk people just add a
parade
catching beads and you know me I'm
avoiding all of it like the hermit that
I am and I'm like I'm gonna fail okay so
yeah let's jump into the video it's
boiling hot in here it's 81 degrees in
here currently and I just turned on the
light so it's gonna be like 85 in here
in no time so I'm gonna be really hot
but that's okay I always get like the
sweat stash when I sweat I get like
sweaty on my upper lip so guilt okay
let's not talk you can just jump into
the video I'm going to start off with
primers because I have two phase timers
I want to talk about and the first one
is the Marc Jacobs primer and this one
is technically called the invisible
undercover perfecting coconut face
primer I think I gotta take a deep
breath after saying that it's a long
name but the thing that I love about
this primer is the way it feels when it
goes on it's got a nice thin milky
moisturizing consistency and I am dry
skin so I don't know if someone who's
oily would like this primer because I
don't know if it really helps with the
longevity of your makeup I just know
that when I apply it to my skin it just
feels like a moisturizer and when I
apply my foundation to my skin it just
feels
everything is just so moisturizing just
blending beautifully that's what I love
about it because I'm always looking for
moisture and hydration that's why I love
this primer but I'm not going to sit
here and say that the smooth out my
pores or like it fills in my fine lines
wrinkled like it doesn't do any of that
it just moisturizes my skin and that's
why I love it
Marc Jacobs sent this out to a ton of
people on their PR list so thank you so
much Marc Jacobs I honestly don't know
if I will be repurchasing it or not but
for the past couple weeks I've been
absolutely loving it next I can't
believe I'm talking about this because
it's such a crazy product but I
absolutely love it and this is the Nivea
men aftershave balm and I got mine in
the sensitive one now I have to give all
the credit to nikkietutorials her name
is ni k kie tutorial she's bummed she's
talented she is definitely the reason
that this is so big on social media
right now I don't even know how she
discovered this but I do know that she's
the one that brought attention to this
on YouTube I would like to know the
story though of how she discovered this
because I'm sure it's gotta be pretty
interesting um anyway the reason why
this works so well like she says is
because it has a high amount of glycerin
in it and glycerin is basically the
superglue in the cosmetic industry
that's why mac fix+
is such a great thing to spray onto your
brush to wet it to apply eyeshadow
because it has glycerin so it kind of
acts like glue and adheres to the skin
you're I'm saying so now that you guys
know that you'll always be looking for
glycerin because that's what we do we're
always looking for glycerin like this is
going to stick so think of it as the
superglue of cosmetics so this really I
love this and what I love about it is
when you apply it to the skin it's nice
and just like gentle and feels kind of
like a serum and then it gets tacky ER
and tackier it starts to feel sticky and
that's when you apply your foundation
and it really feels like your foundation
is going like with glue but it doesn't
feel like it's clogging your pores it
doesn't feel like it's too much like
it's too thick and like your skin can't
breathe it's great and it's so
inexpensive it's a men's product and
what I love this is a glass bottle like
it's so high-quality and what's funny is
if a high-end brand created this primer
and a glass bottle it'd be 50 bucks but
because it's a men's aftershave balm
it's at the drugstore and it's so
reasonably priced which is awesome and
it really is so good um some of my
friends have used
now because nikkietutorials has blown
those products up and they're oily and
they love it I'm dry I love it so it
seems pretty Universal to me so if
you're looking for a good first primer I
would try this very quickly I had a
terrible reaction to Nivea when I was
younger I broke out in a rash all over
my body from it so I was very scared to
try this so I started off with sensitive
and I tested a spot of it on my neck and
I was good to go and I was like dumped
it on my whole face so once I knew that
I wasn't gonna be like breaking out from
it but that's why I got the sensitive
because I've had a really bad experience
with Nivea when I was like 13 14 years
old a young teen okay moving on I feel
like this kind of goes along with
primers and moisturizing so this is the
makeup forever setting spray called mist
infix as you can see I'm almost halfway
gone I use this for about five weeks I
would say and the funny thing is I used
to have this in my freelance kit years
ago when I used it on almost everyone
everyone who had dried to normal skin
and then I haven't had a different
settings ready for the oily clients but
I never used it on myself until recently
and I have fallen in love with it I am
definitely going to be repurchasing this
I love it so much and what it says on
the bottle is that it is a makeup
setting spray that is going to make your
makeup last longer and it's going to
moisturize so this works the same way to
any other makeup setting spray would
when you're completely done spritz your
entire face don't move I always tell
everyone not to move because if you
smile at you talk if you make facial
expressions the wetness of the Mist is
going to make everything go into your
fine lines and wrinkles if you move your
face so just sit still don't move
look straight forward so your mascara
doesn't get on it look straight forward
fan yourself off and then when you're
dry you're good to go it's basically
just going to make all your powders mix
in with your foundation and just make
everything look a little bit more
natural which is what we're going for
right that's why I always use a setting
spray this is definitely the standout
product for me of the month I have two
products today that are like the
standout products and this is the first
one right here and this is the new
Anastasia Beverly Hills brow definer oh
my god you guys I could get really
dramatic really quick right now over my
love for this new brow pencil I am
absolutely obsessed you know if you've
been around my channel that I have been
and a loyal committed long-term
relationship with the broadway's and the
fact that I have completely replaced
that like this says something so they
send this to me in the mail I'm like
okay let's see what it's about I was
kind of nervous because the fact that
it's so thick I was like oh that's what
I'm going to be too harsh on my my Finn
brows so I tried one night got in the
mirror did one brow even do the other
one and I was like my brow is see you
later
the second I use this I have not touched
the brow is once this is so easy to use
because of the fact that it's thicker
it's bigger it's got an angle to it it
goes on just so smooth you can use it
like this and draw it like that or you
can do it sideways and create bolder
thicker lines it is just such a
beautiful product I cannot get over it
like I always have an issue with this
brow right here because I'm missing hair
in the center so I need to straighten it
out like this one but with the brow is
it was always a little too harsh and I
was constantly having to spool spools
Pope's like blend it out but this is
just so easy it she says done I mean I
swear to god it used to take me about
three minutes each brow now 60 seconds
each brow it just cuts the time down I
think it makes it look smoother and more
natural I am hardcore buyer guy of the
new brow definer good job anastacio she
continues to prove why she is the brow
queen that is for sure
speaking of anastasiya this is a total
Rando that I'm going to talk about but
it's one of those things that everyone
needs man woman I don't care who you are
everyone needs a good pair of tweezers
and I feel like it's something that I've
never talked about and it's so important
to find a good pair that is like your
pair of tweezers and this is definitely
my pair of tweezers I've owned these now
for three years and I realize I didn't
realize how important they weren't I
went to LA and I misplaced them for a
week and I was without them and I had to
use my mom's tweezers and I had to use
my friend's tweezers and it wasn't until
I got home that I found these in my
suitcase and I was like thank God I
didn't realize how much I loved these
and how much I needed them so these are
by anastasiya again her logo is pretty
much worn off because I've used it so
many times and they've just been my
babies I also have them in pink as well
I'll find the exact ones and link them
down below for you
the only tweezers that she sells I just
love them they get every single little
tiny baby hair I also use these to apply
my lashes they're nice and sharp they
have a nice intense tightness on the
more they really grab the hair just pull
it out at the root but the same time
they're not so sharp that you're like
scared to use them like there's some
tweezers that are so sharp that I'm like
I'm gonna poke my eye on I'm not using
those they're like razor blades on the
end I used to always use the tweezer man
tweezers my entire life because that's
what my mom and my sister used and then
once I discover these I've never gone
back because these are just the absolute
best Weezer's ever so if you're in the
market for balm tweezers look no further
okay so I have two brushes and I have
just fallen in love with and the number
one I can't believe I'm talking about
this is a fan brush and this is by
morphe and it is the m3 one zero I have
used every fan brush there's like hairs
everywhere I have used every fan brush I
feel like in the existence of brushes
that's dramatic but that's the way I
feel I'm use big ones I knew small ones
on these mediums I've used them all and
I feel like I have never ever fallen in
love with one I use it one time and I'm
I know and I move on to another brush I
have been hardcore in love with the
morphe M 501 this is not technically a
highlight brush but that's just what
I've used it for for the past year and I
love it don't get me wrong I still love
it but it's always nice to find
something new and it's always exciting
to find something new what I love about
the stand brush is when you apply it it
just applies the highlight all over the
cheek in such an easy effortless way
where it's like you use the side not the
top because you're going to get a zebra
stripe if you go like this but when you
go like this and you just apply it like
this it just like fans it out so evenly
and so beautiful this has been the only
brush I've used to highlight for about
the past two weeks I would say two and a
half three doesn't really matter I love
the friggin brush that's what matters it
is extremely expensive because it is
morphe it is the m3
one zero so if you're looking for a
highlight brush this is amazing and if
you want to save even more money you
know I always have a discount code if
you're in the
to save a couple extra pennies I got you
another brush that I can't believe I'm
talking about like I really can't
believe this is actually in a favorites
video right now because I thought I was
gonna hate this forever and this is the
artiste oval-8 brush they have all
different numbers and this is number
eight and I actually show this in and
make up all a few months back and I've
gotten tons of tweets and comments
asking how I feel about it and for the
most part I've responded to a lot of you
guys saying I don't like it I don't like
it it's not what I was hoping it would
be I still like it
well I powered through I did more
research on it I kept trying cuz I want
to like it cuz it's so different it's so
cool I want to enjoy it and not just
think of it as a big weird-looking
hairbrush or a toothbrush or some swords
and the only brush that I took with me
while I was in LA for twelve days and I
used it every day that I was there and I
just absolutely loved it now and the way
I use it is I take my foundation and I
put on the back of my hand and with my
finger I put it directly on the face and
then I blend out the reason that is this
shape in the whole thing the idea behind
this brush right here is it's not going
to steal your foundation so it's going
to make your foundation go a lot further
with a lot less product so let's say if
you usually use three to four pumps of
foundation with this you're going to use
one to two pumps of foundation it is
just so different so innovative I really
really love it so instead of sealing the
product it presses it into the skin and
blends it on to the actual face so I
have been loving this brush so much it
is an expensive little bugger I'm not
gonna lie and it's funny because the
whole thing is like buy the expensive
brush and then you can save money on
your foundation and it's like I don't
know if that evens out but I really
really love this so you guys won't be
seeing me use it more and more I'm sure
that runt steps
so speaking of brushes I have a brush
cleaner next that I have been loving and
I'm so excited to discover this because
I feel like I found a dupe I think I
never find dupes for things right and
I'm losing my voice that's not cute but
anyways I have loved the Beauty Blender
cleaner for such a long time it's like a
small white thin take off the top and
you swirl your brush in there and clean
it and that is pretty pricy for what
you're getting but it is anime
using cleaner I use it to clean my
beauty blender I use it to clean my
brushes I also take my brushes to the
sink and deep clean them this is just
like day to day when I want to clean
something real quick and I only have
like four brushes this is what I use so
I have discovered this and it's the
boulevard mineral cosmetics and it's
called the brush shampoo and conditioner
and it really does shampoo and condition
your brushes and they have all different
scents this is lavender because lavender
is my favorite I have used this specific
one I have two different scents I've
used that one as well
I've use the lavender one I would say
eight to ten times maybe and it looks
untouched you can see some makeup over
here like in the edge but it looks
untouched like it really goes such a
long way and it's so inexpensive you can
get this at morphe brushes like you can
get their store I think you can get it
online um but they like full of our
cosmetics is also sold on other online
websites I'll find it down below and
link it for you but anyway so what you
do is you just go to the sink wet your
brush swirl it around in here it's going
to get nice and sudsy and like shampoo
would just rinse it in your hand boom
done lay it on a paper towel it's just
super super simple and your brushes feel
nice and clean and conditioned as well
so I've really been loving this again
brush shampoo and conditioner by a
boulevard cosmetics so to super random
products and the first one is a protein
bar and this is called perfect bar you
can find this at Whole Foods there's
like a refrigerator section like in like
some iowa love some sort i don't know
but this is in there these need to be
refrigerated and you can take them out
and eat them
but for the most part they need to stay
in the refrigerator so i discovered this
because while I was in Los Angeles I
went to this Eastern medicine doctor
that my friend goes to and they do
essential oil stuff and they do
acupuncture and like chiropractic work
like all natural healing for the body
the mind body soul they help with like
anxiety all that kind of stuff so
anyways while I was there I was getting
acupuncture name on my first time which
was so weird I've never had acupuncture
and I hate needles so like oh she was
putting in my legs I'm just like and
she's asking me how I felt I was like
I'm good I'm a little dizzy but like I
you know is that normal and she was like
when was last time you had protein and I
was like um what I mean I had a doughnut
for breakfast and like
decaf coffee for lunch uh like I was not
taking care of myself that day at all so
she was like oh my god girl so she ran
to her purse she brought me back the
perfect bar oh my god so I ate the
entire thing I devoured it and I was so
full I didn't eating for the rest of the
night it was like six o'clock and it
filled me up for the whole night she was
telling me how this is such a clean
green natural bar how is it the best one
she's found on the market my mom she was
reading the ingredients she was like oh
my god so she took pictures of it
immediately the next morning we woke up
we went to Whole Foods we bought tons of
them and I'm obsessed now so I've been
eating one like every day they are
expensive for a bar they're like $2.99
which I like but honestly like it fills
me up like a meal and it's just so good
all different flavors they're so good I
think I've tried all of them at this
point the fruit acai one is so yummy
there's a fruit nut one there's a peanut
butter one has like a peanut butter
sandwich so good but anyways yeah if
you're interested if you're trying to
find like a good protein bar I would
definitely try this out the almond
butter one I think is the most filling
it says it's gluten free 13 grams of
protein non-gmo twenty-plus superfoods
so sounds pretty bomb another food item
that you guys are probably gonna laugh
at me because oh my gosh of any of my
friends are watching us right now
they're gonna bid because I do not cook
in any way but oh my gosh I have to talk
about this because I have been in love
ever since um December like 27th to be
exact it's a really long story but
basically my mom is obsessed with these
seasonings then my good friend Jackie
she loves to cook so she used my mom
seasonings one time at her house she
fell in love then she told my friend
Micah about them Micah fell in love and
then Christmas came around and I wanted
to get a present for my friend Mike
because he loves to cook
so I bought him this along with some
kitchen stuff and he fell in love with
them and so everyone is like you have to
try it so I finally got the garlic
lovers one and this is by the brand
flavor god I don't know anything about
cooking but all like the chefs in my
life they all tell me that these are the
best seasonings ever so if you love
cooking and you can check that flavor
god I would and know this is not
sponsored forever God does not know who
I am I know I've seen them sponsor if
you keep on this again before I'm not
one of them I promise
um so the way I use this is I actually
put it on me and John's Pizza
it is so good you guys gonna laugh at me
but it's so friggin good I'm such a
pizza lover like you don't know I've
been a pizza lovers is a little girl who
is it every time I travel I have to eat
the pizza of that city in that town but
that's how I judge if I'm going to come
back like let me try your pizza and then
we'll talk like I could never move
somewhere where there's not good pizza
available so I put this on my pizza and
it just amplified everything it just
tastes so freakin good just sitting here
I can smell it and it's like making me
salivate inside it's just so yummy
there's so many different flavors my
flavor God but the garlic lovers is the
one that I am like committed to it's so
yummy so yeah I know that's random but
just that I would thrown out there okay
we have two more products and the first
one is a hair product I feel like I
never talked about hair products and I
should because I am so picky because I
hate my hair so the hair pack works for
me it's like because like I said I hate
my hair and this is my Bumble and Bumble
it's called the BB thickening dry spun
finish spray and it says on the bottle
dry spray creates instant fullness and
holds airy texture the way I use this is
I curl my hair and then once my curls
have set and they're like nice and
cooled down I take this product and I
grab my hair and I just spray like this
and I just separate my hair and I spray
it just creates instant fullness and
volume I can't feel the product in my
hair which is super cool like it doesn't
feel sticky it doesn't feel tacky I
don't feel anything it just makes it
messy and full which I love I've
actually been using this for over a year
and I'm just never talked about it but I
repurchase this many many many times and
I love it okay so the last part that I
have is a curling wand which is very
surprising to my own self because I have
been dedicated to bellamy curling wands
for ever went forever like I use nume
curling wands and then I used Bellamy
curling wands and that's just the way
it's always been
my friend was telling me though that I
need to start trying more curling wands
because she was like Jacqueline there's
other brands out there that sell bomb
styling tools that you're not using and
I'm like that's true so maybe that's why
I hate my hair so much maybe I need to
try more styling tools so I jumped
online I was 4.com of course and I saw
great reviews for this one it's called
the sultry eye
that's just the brand sul tra who sex to
me Oh Jackie is crazy anyways so this
just has one barrel it doesn't have any
other sizes just this one you can't
adjust the temperature so I was like
this seems kind of weird it seems super
basic honey don't be fooled this is not
a basic it heats up like this and it
curls your hair like this and your hair
holds the curl like this like it is
amazing so it gives just like really
beachy semi tight but not too tight
curls it's a great great size I love
this because of how fast it curls your
hair like I'm not kidding I pull my hair
wrap hold and then I let go and duh like
I'm not kidding it's like two or three
seconds each hair strand which is insane
and that's why I love this so much so
I'm not saying anything bad about
Bellamy like I'm still gonna use Bellamy
because they have the bigger barrel that
I love for like the looser like more
daytime chic professional is um but I
really really love this like really
quick messy wavy hair it's just amazing
so again it's my soldier I'll find it
for you guys and they get down below I
got my own Sephora calm I'm sure you can
find it in many other places so yeah
that kind of leases do do you guys I
think I went to that pretty quickly a
Milken Wars thank you for watching and
we'll be back with a makeup haul from LA
