my my Brayton literally just stopped
today I'm going to be doing my July
favorites Wow
I'm always kind of happy and sad to see
July go because fourth of July is one of
my favorite holidays and it's also the
anniversary to my husband and i's
engagement and then my birthday is July
20th so it's usually a good month
because of those two days but at the
same time some are so miserably hot here
in Florida that like every month closer
to fall on my go thank god yes we're
moving forward to some coolness because
it's so miserably hot right now like I'm
literally like sweat is dripping down my
chest I'm talking and weighs me on so
the first thing I'm going to talk about
our two eyeshadows that I did use in my
most recent tutorial and these are from
the new Milani collection at least I
think they're new they're newer and I
believe it's called the Bella line
because every single eyeshadow has the
word Bella in front of it so right here
is Bella cafe and Bella cappuccino I did
go through these in my latest tutorial I
don't know if I just said that or not
I'm literally feeling so all over the
place I'm about to have a heat stroke
these are both a satin matte which i
think is a great way to describe them
because they're not a total matte they
do have a slight bit of like glow and
Sheen but yet there is no shimmer or
glitter I also own Bella champagne I use
that in my latest tutorial but I do not
like that one as much as I like the
satin mattes because I just feel like
it's a little chunky and it just wasn't
the greatest thing I've tried where
these I really do like them it's pretty
much impossible to find a good brown
eyeshadow from the drugstore that you
can use as a transition color in your
crease it's something that the drugstore
really needs and Milani did a good job
with these because even though they're
not extremely pigmented when you're
looking for a color for that crease area
you really don't need it to be very
pigmented these are very smooth and
creamy how they apply so I really like
them so this one is Bella cappuccino and
this one is Bella cafe cafe is more of
like a caramel and cappuccino is a
little bit more red tones in it
there are tons there they probably have
like 30 different colors but I just
picked up three just for starters
so Bella cappuccino and Bella cafe I
have to mention this lipstick since I
purchased it because of you guys you
seriously feel me away
- well over the past month to two months
I would say I've gotten so many comments
from you guys telling you to go try -
why a cell number ten and oh my gosh is
like my new obsession I have owned it
since late June and it's almost half
gone already it is so gorgeous and this
is from the Rouge poor couture
collection it's in the square packaging
where typically you see like the round
little packaging that gets a little bit
more pressed but this is absolutely
amazing it is so creamy it goes on so
amazing so pigmented it is just a
beautiful new this will have gone so
many skin tones because it's not like a
powdered sugar nude but it's not a brown
nude it's just absolutely beautiful I've
been wearing it non-stop Mondays where I
wear barely any makeup or you know when
I'm doing a smoky eye I have just been
loving this so thank you to you guys
recommending this to me I freaking love
it
I'm obsessed as my new favorite nude so
thank you for that expensive addiction
this next lipstick right here I have
seriously been trying to get my hands on
for over a month and I randomly found it
when I was at a CVS almost 30 miles away
from home next to my friend's house and
it was the last one in stock and I was
like yes and it is the L'Oreal Jennifer
L'Oreal L'Oreal Jennifer's nude JLo
teamed up with L'Oreal to create this
lipstick and a few other celebrities but
I didn't care about them I just wanted
this one because it was the prettiest
and I freaking love Jennifer Lopez I
have ever since I was a wee little tot I
just love her so this first of all the
packaging I have to say I love I think
it's so much sleeker than the typical
L'Oreal packaging I love that matte
black and gold I love black googled
anything the color itself is so so
pretty oh and now that I'm putting on my
hand
hello it is so similar to the YSL ten
Wow so this is the Jennifer Lopez nude
right here and it has a little bit more
like a loft tone in it but I'm going to
be honest like hello for the price
difference this is the YSL ten and this
is the Jennifer Lopez I'm going to be
real with you right now like get it
together that's pretty similar I did
mention this in my Bridal tutorial and
also my latest tutorial but I have to
take them
to talk about this this is the hourglass
hourglass L glance this is the hourglass
ambient lighting powder in the shade
luminous light let me just say after
that if you're getting married
this is amazeballs for any bride it is
so beautiful
just honestly I use this term all the
time but it truly doesn't make you look
like you're glowing from within I've
never used any highlighter like this one
before it looks so natural and so
beautiful and just you can wear this
without any makeup and just dust it on
your cheeks with your fingertips and
it's going to just give you such a
beautiful dewy glow I will say this is
such an ideal highlighting powder for
someone who's oily and does not want
tons of extra shimmer that's going to
bring even more attention to the oil the
excess oil they don't like this will be
a great highlighting powder for you
because it is not overboard it's not too
much it's just so beautiful I'm hoping
that the camera is picking this up right
here but it is just so beautiful and
natural and it just looks like skin it
doesn't look like a highlighting powder
it's just absolutely gorgeous I would
also recommend the minutes light for
someone who's more much inin m'c in it
for someone who is more mature on skin
and doesn't want to emphasize any
imperfections or fine lines but you
still want to highlight this would be
beautiful on you okay so this guy's
products I have to talk about it because
I'm using an all month but I don't know
if it's a favor or not let me just let
me just get into it so you understand
I'm saying this is a bare minerals bare
skin here brightening serum foundation
tons of you have asked me for a review
or a demo on this but at this moment I
honestly don't want to say I'm
mentioning this in my favorites video
because so many people have asked my
thoughts on it I will be honest I love
this foundation I love it literally
three drops will cover my entire face it
goes so far I love the finish that it
gives it's a very natural finish but it
still gives me a slight glow I
definitely that someone who is normal
too maybe combination could wear this if
your oily this may not be your best
friend I'm just going to be real I think
this is completely breaking me out I had
to change anything in my skincare
routine or face routine at all the past
four weeks my skin was freaking out like
last month in the month before that I
finally got under control and figured
out what works for me and now I have
been using this this
a month and I wore three days in a row
and all of a sudden I woke up yesterday
with bumps like everywhere and just
blemishes so I'm gonna be real I love
the way this applies I love the way it
looks it is absolutely beautiful I truly
think that it looks like my skin even
after I've had it on for six or seven
hours I'll go in the bathroom and be
shocked because I'm like wow this
seriously just looks like a version of
my skin just better but I off something
that's breaking me out so maybe she
because my skin is ultra sensitive right
now
I don't know but let me know if any of
you have experienced the breaking out
issues with the bare skin foundation I
know that some people tell me that
there's very good and very bad reviews
and mine is right in between I'm going
to give it a break like a week let this
clear up try it again and see if it
comes back and then I'll definitely know
but at this moment I really like it but
I think it might be the cause of
situations that my makeup is hiding this
next product I just have to talk about
because I want everybody to know that
NARS has reformulated their lip glosses
and they are so much better the old lip
glosses do not hold a candle to these
this right here is the shade Turkish
delight and that is one of my fake note
it is my favorite lip gloss by NARS so
all the colors are still the exact same
they just be formulated them and
repackage them to make them look a
little bit better that repulsive smell
that NARS lip glosses have no longer do
they smell like that they are pretty
much scentless yeah they pretty much
have no scent whatsoever
they're a little bit creamier where
before NARS lip glosses have a kind of
like a watery base and after an hour
they just kind of like evaporated and
left your lips where now they're a
little bit creamier and a little bit
more pigmented out if you can see that
on the back of my hand that is Turkish
Delight it's a beautiful baby pink gloss
it looks good on so many people Kim
Kardashian used to wear this all the
time when she first started getting big
and blowing up and so she made that
gloss really popular but if any of you
do not like the smell of formula of NARS
lip glosses go out and try the new
formulation because it is so much better
speaking of lip glosses I have
loving these from the company a girl
lactic I got these I think at the end of
June and pretty much all month long I
have been in love with these sweet
shades and they are Bella just nude and
baby doll baby doll is the color that I
was using in my most recent tutorial I
wasn't sure the name at the time but it
is baby doll right here we have Bella
baby doll and then just new Bella and
baby doll both have a little bit of
sparkle in it but not too much Sparkle
were too glittery just enough so it
looks really shiny and glistening on the
lips and then just nude is literally
just nude there's no spark while there's
no glitter it's just a new gloss it's
absolutely beautiful
and they also smell really good they're
highly pigmented and they're very creamy
so I really really love these girl
active lip glosses I hadn't ever heard
of them up until up until last month but
they're really awesome and I know they
have tons of shade so I'll link them
down below for you guys to check them
out for yourself I just absolutely love
them
there we go now you can really see them
see what did I tell you
gorgina I have to mention these
eyeshadows because I have been wearing
them all month long they are both from
makeup geek I did show them in my
favorite makeup geek eyeshadow video
that I will link below this one right
here is cupcake and then this one is
bitten I have been loving a cupcake how
I wear this is I put it in my crease
area along with the typical grounds that
I use and it just makes the eye look so
much more summery and since it's more of
a Mavi pink and not a baby pink what it
actually does is if you have a slight
tan it will actually make the skin
appear Tanner I know that sounds kind of
weird but it will sense it's just a
beautiful ma be pink and since it's
naked peak it's so pigmented and so
beautiful and then this right here is
bitten which I am just obsessed obsessed
obsessed obsessed with it is so pretty
I've never seen any color by anybody
like this and I'm wearing it all along I
do have this on my eyes today on the
lower lash line and I have basically
been wearing it in a way where I already
place it with brown typically where I
would put any Browns out I put bit in
there instead it's just such a warm wine
purpley just a amazing warm reddish it's
just everything the end gives me life so
but in a cupcake
I've been wearing them together I'm
wearing separate I just love them I've
pretty much been wearing one of them
every single day the whole month of July
and I'm gonna lie another I love its
mask when I quickly talk about a jewelry
brand that I have recently fallen in
love with I've gotten so many questions
recently about the necklaces and
earrings and bracelets that I've been
wearing and most of it is Finn from the
brand and bauble bar I don't know if I'm
pronouncing that right I could totally
be butchering this but Nordstrom started
carrying this brand a couple months ago
as soon as I got the email notification
I was in love all their stuff is just so
different and edgy and things that I
really haven't seen that's been done
before what I'm wearing right now this
is bauble bar this is bubble bar I have
worn this I've over worn this the past
two months I've worn it way too much if
you ever see me wearing like ear cuffs
or like mix matching earrings or
anything edgy or just cool it's probably
going to be from bauble bar I just
absolutely love them I have been
purchasing so much jewelry from in the
past couple of months I will link it
down below I'll link their website and
the pieces on Nordstrom because they
both have some different things so I'll
link that all for you down below if
you're interested but I have to spend in
love they're just so cool and different
I need a minute I'm so sweaty I did not
actually taken the time to talk to you
guys about this curling one yet even
though I sprinkled it here and there how
much I love it but it's like 5 10
seconds at a time but I just wanted to
actually talk about this to you guys
because seriously if you are in the mock
mock if you in the market if you're in
the market for a curling wand
this is the best curling wand I've ever
used it is the Bellamy six and one and
what I mean by six by six by one six and
one is that this top right here this
pops off and it comes with six different
barrels and six different sizes so you
can get huge voluminous ways Victoria
Secret waves tight Shirley Temple weighs
six different sizes that you can get
with this one only give this back on
we're going to do the reel this is the
hottest curling wand I've ever used and
it holds the curl for so long my hair is
just naturally straight as hay and never
wants to hold a curl if I curl my hair
no matter how tight typically the next
morning
and it's like just straight and stuck to
my head this is the only one I have ever
used where my hair literally holds a
curl for three days straight until I
wash it I absolutely love it when I
shower I blow dry my hair and then I
will immediately curl it and I'm good in
the next three days my hair might not be
perfect but it'll still have that really
nice weight effect to it so I just love
this Bellamy six in one it's awesome I
recommend it to anybody it is kind of
expensive but do not buy it without a
coupon code I will put my coupon code
for you guys down below because it saves
it over $100 on it so make sure you use
a coupon code if you're going to buy
that one because let's just get real why
would it you speaking of hair this is
the bamboo 48 hour sustainable volume
spray I absolutely love this as you can
tell it's down to here I've owned it for
a month and a half and it's almost gone
so in damp air I just spray this all
over my entire head of hair and probably
do like 10 to 15 sprays because I overdo
everything in life it actually gives my
hair volume which is a big deal because
my hair naturally again strays Hey and
what's the leaf flat to my head this
actually gives me volume and I
absolutely love it last but not least
this is the Mirai skin smoothing polish
this is just an exfoliating scrub that
you can use after washing your face and
it's really smooth and it's not really
harsh so if you're sensitive like me
this will work great for you I
absolutely love it and what I like about
it so much is that after I'm done I
honestly feel like it tightens my pores
and that's like no joke and then after I
had used it a few times I saw on here
that it says that it helps relieve
congested pores and then on the back it
says that it helps tighten pores and
with oil production and I was like that
explains on my pores feel so much
tighter after I use this so someone with
oil can also benefit from this I really
love it again it's not really harsh and
abrasive it's a really nice smooth
exfoliator which is nice for someone
with sensitive skin so that is it for my
July favorites work and as always make
sure that you leave me your favorites
for the month of July in the comment
section down below that is honestly my
favorite part about filming these videos
