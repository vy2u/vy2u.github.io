beauty favorites I'm sitting in front of
my couch again not because this is like
my new place that I plan on something
but because my camera is still not here
i order this camera now I believe it was
nine days ago and to make a very long
story short ups completely messed up
with the delivery of this camera i payed
to overnight it and they ended up
holding it at the shipping facility for
me to come pick it up because apparently
I requested to pick it up even though I
didn't request to pick it up and then
instead of trying to redeliver it they
sent it back to the sender so my camera
is now currently headed back to New York
City to the B&amp;amp;H photo headquarters so
because of that I still don't have a
camera to use other than my small lo
blogging camera so this is the only
place that really works with my vlogging
camera in my house I try putting it on
my tripod where I normally sit in front
of my desk and it just was not working
the angle was terrible because of the
way this camera is so yeah I'm gonna
shut up about that story now I'm sure
you weren't interested to begin with so
anyways I apologize if the lighting is a
little wonky or if the angle is a little
off this is what we're working with
though so I figure better a kind of
misplaced video than no video at all
right right so before jumping into my
favourites eyes want to quickly say
thank you so much for the outpour of
love that I received on my last video
which was my New York City vlog I was
not expecting that whatsoever thank you
so much it just goes to show even more
you know how incredibly blessed I am to
have you guys just so many beautiful
people following me and I just continue
to be blessed by you every day so thank
you so much I wasn't joking in that vlog
I just feel like that meetup really did
change me for the better I know that
might sound cheesy but I don't really
care I just feel like the past few days
I've just been on cloud nine and I just
feel like I
I just feel amazing because of you guys
like you guys have just inspired me so
much you just inspired me just to look
at the good and just keep moving forward
and you guys filled up my love tank so I
am very thankful for that
so the first favourites of my video
since I'm sitting here drinking it to
begin with is the drink that I always
talk about from Starbucks the reason I'm
going to mention is to you guys is
because I
I'm not joking I probably get two to
three hundred tweets every single day
asking a specific name of this drink
that I'm always raving about if you
follow me on snapchat I talked about
this way too often but it's so freaking
good
so anyways this is the Starbucks passion
iced tea lemonade sweetened with a pump
of raspberry so this is a grande sized
so when I get in grande I get one pump
of raspberry if I get it in venti I'll
get two or three pumps of raspberry so
it is a passion fruit iced tea lemonade
with a pump a raspberry and sweetened if
you don't get it sweetened then it's
like kind of bitter but some people like
that but I get my sweetened so that is
the drink from Starbucks so I cannot get
enough of it is so freaking good so this
is a glam glow flash mud mask and this
is the most recent member of the glam
glow family I personally think that lamb
glow is the best brand when it comes to
face masks they are my absolute favorite
masks in the world the white jar the
blue jar the green jar and the orange
jar like I use all of them on a monthly
basis this one which is the flash mud
and then the hydrating one that's in the
blue jar if you are dry those two masks
they are literally life-changing they
help my skin so much I go back and forth
between this and the blue one back and
forth on a weekly basis I use this and
the blue one both one time a week and I
just they're a match made in heaven
sometimes I'll do this one and I'll do
the blue one immediately afterwards in
the same night and my skin just feels so
incredible so anyways this one right
here the new flash mud one it says it is
going to brighten improve radiance
luminosity even tone and correct
basically what I like about this mask is
it is the most amazing exfoliator in the
world so when it goes on its just kind
of like a super grainy it feels like
there's sand in it like a thin white
grainy mask let it set my skin for ten
minutes
and then when you wash it off it is so
incredibly exfoliating it feels
incredible now this is a map that will
probably leave your skin red unless
you're not sensitive at all but I have
very sensitive skin so my face always
looks like I just got beaten up
afterwards it's like beet red for like
30 minutes but I love it because it is
like one of the only things I feel like
Trulli removes every single piece of
dead skin like when i went to new york
my skin was so freakin dry and it just
happens every single time I fly I'm dry
as it is and going up into the air just
makes my skin that much worse and I had
like literal pieces of dead skin like
sitting on my nose and I was exfoliating
and I was exfoliating when I was there
when I came back but it was still dry
and could feel like the tightness on my
face
so yesterday I use this mask and it is
the only thing that completely got rid
of my dryness I use this mask I went in
with my normal moisturizer and my skin
is back to normal it just looks so
luminous afterwards and so glowy it just
really removes all of the dead skin and
no I am NOT sponsored by glam glow I
just love their products that much so
this is the glam glow flash mud mask if
you have dry skin if you need to remove
if you want luminosity or radiance you
will love that mask why I'm so obsessed
with me boy I wanna know I should talk
about lip products next right I mean it
wouldn't be a Jaclyn hill favorites
video if I didn't talk about my lip
products the first one I want to talk
about is super random because I don't
even know like what this is or where
this came from
I honestly think that somebody handed
this to me in a goodie bag at IMATS last
year in January 2014 I have the
slightest memory of someone giving this
to me this is a lipstick by appeal
cosmetics and it's in the shade mock-up
and you guys you know what there's
probably honest-to-god nothing so
special about this lipstick other than
the fact that I just love nude lipsticks
and I swear to God I can have 30
different new lipsticks from thirty
different brands and I'm gonna be like
they are all so different and you can
swatch them and there's literally no
difference whatsoever but in my mind I'm
like I need every single one of them in
my life so this is just a really
beautiful new lipstick and I have been
loving it recently it's just fair
it's honestly just a very pigmented very
creamy opaque nude pinkish lipstick I
love it so much it's like a mix between
Mac blankety and Mac Kreme Kup like if
those two had a baby that would be this
lipstick right here I don't even know
where to find this lipstick online
honestly I have no idea but it again is
by appeal cosmetics in the shade mock up
I have a millennium of his brand
whatsoever like I've never talked about
something in a favorites video that I've
just been so like about in my life but I
have been using this new lipstick
constantly like the past six weeks and I
figured you know what if I've been using
it I should talk about it so this next
favorite that I have been obsessed with
for the past I would say six weeks is a
why sell lipstick and it's the color
that I'm wearing on my lips right now I
have been wearing this like crazy in the
summertime I just love coral peach lips
I think it looks so beautiful on pale
skin on tan skin my favorite is a blonde
that wears coral lips I don't know why I
think coral lips are so flattering on
blonde hair I think it just looks
gorgeous like a match made in heaven
but anyways this is why I sell lipstick
and the number 13 very pigmented creamy
coral peachy lip color I think it is
gorgeous
I have looked everywhere for a shade
that is comparable to this and just as
beautiful as this and not thirty dollars
and I can't find one if you guys have an
amazing recommendation for a creamy
opaque coral lipstick you let me know
because I am all about corals and
peaches I just think they are so
gorgeous so again this is why I sell
number 13 you can see what it looks like
on my lips up close this angle is so
awkward I look like such like a peanut
head but still you can see the color
it's a very very pretty shade I think
it's beautiful
so in my Sephora haul a couple weeks ago
I told you guys I would let you know how
I feel about the new Marc Jacobs lip
glosses and let me just say I feel very
passionately about them these are
absolutely gorgeous I have been loving
these glosses so I did get them in two
shades of course they are both news I
got them in sugar sugar and I got them
in moon glow moon glow I'll start with
that one first it is a very pale color I
can't wear this by itself because it's
just too pale of a gloss um but I will
wear this over top of a lip stick and
you can see it right there
look at the shine you guys know that I
have been talking
so much recently about glosses being
glossy if you like so many glosses that
are coming out recently are so thick and
so cake that when you apply them they
look and feel more like a lipstick and I
miss a glossy gloss I've been saying
this for a couple of months now
like those Kris Jenner lips I swear to
God the woman has the glossiest lips in
the entire world like I want to meet
kris Jenner's makeup artist Vig what's
the gloss like I need that blast in my
life um
Urban Decay used to have a gloss that
was like the most amazing wet looking
lip gloss in the world but it has
continued it so this one right here is
called sugar sugar which is a little bit
of a warmer nude with a little bit more
pigment so it's not as pale as Moonglow
sugar sugar I have been wearing this one
out I've been wearing this constantly I
just love them they're moisturizing on
the lips they're just very soft and
they're very glossy so I've really
really been like you need some our
Jacobs lip glosses another gloss which
is an oldie but a mother truck and
goodie if you guys have been around on
my channel for a long time then you will
recognize this bad boy right here this
is the buxom lip polish in the shade
White Russian I swear to God I keep
going back to this I keep repurchasing
this gloss so good I also love the shade
Samantha which is a nude color but it
has a little bit of gold reflex in it so
beautiful especially for the summertime
but this one is white Russian and the
only reason I'm talking about this
specific shade is because it's what was
closest to me but I'm just talking about
the formulation in general I feel like
buxom lip polish they are definitely the
award winning glossy gloss like your
lips just look wet when I did my Sephora
meet-and-greet there was someone working
there at the Sephora Union Square which
by the way Sephora Union Square has such
an amazing team there were so many cool
people that work there I just loved them
but there was a girl that had the
glossiest lips and I was like what are
you wearing and she was like oh it's
buxom I was like of course it is so
buxom lip polish I feel like they
definitely take the cake for like my
favorite glosses right now I will say
that they have a very intense minty feel
to them so if you're in a cold climate
as weird as it is it will make you
freezing cold I have worn this in the
winter months before up in Chicago and I
regretted it it's like when you're in
the freezing cold you put in like a
really
like spearmint gum you're like oh it's
so freezing that's how this is but if
you are in warm climates in the summer
and you put this on your lips
honest to god it will make you feel
cooler if you're all like a hot summer
day
so like wearing this to the pool to the
beach if you're going to like a concert
you'll appreciate it's very minty next I
have a blending brush by morphe and this
is the m4 for one honestly you guys I
have been so in love with this brush
recently I didn't know that they made
this brush I had no idea
um I am like pretty set in my ways when
it comes to eyeshadow brushes especially
blending brushes like I use my e25 from
Sigma my e-40 like they're going out of
style like I'm obsessed with them so the
fact that another blending brush has fit
into my like necessary blending
collection it's a big deal I use this in
a sigma e40 to do my eyes today and that
was it like I just love this so much
it's just so fluffy it's a tiny bit
longer than the Sigma e25 which I never
knew how much I would love that it's
just so fluffy and easy but yet it's
dense enough to get precision I love it
if you're in the market for a good and
expensive blending brush look no further
the M 441 by morphe I am an affiliate
with them so you can use my code Jack
Attack and all caps and that will get
you 10% off if you're in the mood to
save a little money this is the Kat Von
D shade light eye palette it took me a
minute to jump on this bandwagon I
really don't know why I can be stubborn
when it comes to palettes I don't know
why I had this like towards palettes I
don't know what palettes ever did to me
and why I hold a grudge but for some
reason I'm just kind of like when it
comes to palettes I don't know why I
need to get over that but if you notice
I don't use many palettes in my
tutorials I just use my single
eyeshadows I'm like I know it works for
me and I don't need palettes but this
has kind of broken me out of that I
really really like this palette I hate
it when it's dirty though constant
blowing it so constantly blowing it
you're done I mean if that's not what
she said that I don't even know what she
said that's how much she said that
that's what she said so this is an all
matte palette which is just freaking
glorious and there are tons of warm
shades but there's also cool shades in
here as well which I love it's just such
an easy palette to do so many different
colors
I've been very intimate I shadow
recently I went through a stage where I
needed my shimmer I need my glaring my
Sparkle all day every day but recently
as you can tell I have been really
feeling matte shadows I just love it so
these are really high quality shadows
you guys like I really don't have
anything bad to say about them other
than they can be a little dusty in the
sense that when you go to put a brush in
one I'll just show you guys right here
so you know what I'm talking about
like when you go to put a brush in one
do you see how much product comes out of
it and like how much goes on the brush
that's what I mean by dusty is I feel
like with a really really good quality
eyeshadow like a makeup geek shadow when
I go like this with my brush not that
much shadow and product falls out
because it's creamy and it's pigmented
so just a little bit goes a long way and
it really grabs onto the bristles of the
brush um that's the only thing which is
not that big of a deal it just might
mean that you might need to just go back
in with like a second layer as opposed
to just one but these are blendable and
I really like them I think they're great
shadows I think this is a really nice
palette and you have these three colors
up here and this is such an amazing
transition color right here by the way
you guys if you're going for a cool tone
i anytime i have worn a cool tone look
recently this is the shadow that i will
use because i just think it's such a
great perfect transition shade and then
this peachy shade right here don't get
me started freaking love it so that is
the Kat Von D shade light eye palette I
really do enjoy this this is the
hourglass ambient lighting palette again
another palette look at me go um I don't
know if this is actually still available
of Sephora but if it's not it's not that
big of a deal except I even specifically
talking about the palette I'm talking
about the colors in the palette you guys
know how much I love my hourglass
luminous light um
highlighter which is not in this palette
it's sold individually so let me just
tell you what happened I reached down
for my luminous light one day and it was
gone gone I don't know where that little
bit trying off to but it's it's gone
like it is it's nowhere to be found I
have dug through my entire makeup
collection and it's gone so some little
gremlin crept into my house and stole my
luminous night and then took off because
it's gone and I really want to
repurchase it but I'm just like so in
the meantime I have been using this bad
boy because I got this for Christmas or
some family
um but anyways so I've been using this
recently and what I have been loving
about this is I have been as you know
very into glowy dewy skin do you feel me
and so recently what I have been doing
when I set my under eye concealer and I
always go in with like the Anastacio
banana powder and like the Mac
emphasized and I lightly dust that on
very lightly like I have not been
packing it on recently like I used to
I'm just kind of like very lightly
dusting it on and then what I'll do is I
will take these shades any of them I'll
take this one I'll take this one I'll
take this one I'll combine them all
whatever I'll just take any of these
shades and I will then lightly swoop
these underneath that eye area as well I
don't know if you can tell in the camera
but I am very dry as I said five
thousand times and so my under eye area
can look dry and look kind of creepy
sometimes and kind of like aged me in a
way and I hate it so when I have been
using these just to lightly sweep over
that area it just gives my under eye
area just life back to it and it just
makes it look more youthful and glowy
and especially in person I don't know if
the camera is picking it up very well as
I'm looking I can't really see that area
but in person it just makes my face
looks so much more youthful and alive so
that's why I've been using these four
again I don't know if this palette was
limited or not I am Not sure but if it's
not it's not a big deal any of these
hourglass highlighters will do the trick
these are the ambient lighting powders
it just so happened that I lost my
luminous light so I have used a the
palette but I thought that would let you
guys know if you guys are dry and you
want to try that it really has been
working wonders now if you overdo it it
will work against you you don't want to
pack these on your under eye area just
like a couple of very light sweeps will
just bring a lot more light and
attention to that area so I have this
all under like my entire eye area but
then just the top of my cheekbones I
have on champagne pop so you can see
like champagne pop right here but all
everything else is this palette and I
have on a matte blush in a matte bronzer
so you can see like all of this that's
this palette right here okay moving on
another palette look at me go what I'm
over here saying oh I never use Alex and
I have a third powers I'm so proud of my
I bought this palette because an old
friend that used to work at Mac with me
Adrienne she told me that I needed to
try these because she said that they are
hands down the best shadow she's ever
used in her life so like damn girl okay
calm down I'll try it so this is by the
brand vies art vis arts it's vis e art
vies art I don't know whatever so this
is the palette zero one neutral matte I
think they have two or three palettes
they are online only I believe they said
at least that's what I said when I
bought mine a few weeks ago and you know
me of course I bought the palette that
had mostly warm shades and I have been
loving this palette recently this is
what I'm wearing on my entire eyes today
I am wearing this color and these two
colors in the crease and I am wearing
this on the lower lash line and I
blended it out with this and this shade
right here I just think these are
beautiful this little like reddish color
right here is gorge they are very
pigmented they're very blendable this
was a pricey palette I don't remember
exactly how much I spent on it so I'm
not gonna lie about like for other
things that day comes but it was it was
pricey but if you are trying to find a
great neutral palette that is nice and
small and condensed and amazing quality
this right here like these are amazing
you know me though you guys I honestly
I'm not going to tell you you need this
in your life I'm just sharing this is
one of my favorites of the month but
honestly these are totally duplicated
with makeup geek shadows and I think
makeup geek shadows are just as good I
personally think makeup shadows are the
best shadows in the game that's just my
humble opinion but this is amazing so if
you guys are looking for a really great
palette right here I have to talk about
these candles so I mention he's on
snapchat a couple weeks ago so this is
by the brand
Tyler candle company and my good friend
Linda is the one that introduced me to
these she came over to my house and she
was like girl you are obsessed with
candles and I was like I know like I
have a different candle in every room at
all times so she was like you need to
get on Tyler candle company and get
yourself some candles they're incredible
so Tyler candle company does not have an
official website I don't think I have to
order from like this random website I'll
try to find it and link it down below
these candles are 20 hours a piece but
they are so amazing so my favorite one
hands down is the one I am burning back
here and it's called warm sugar cookie
you guys never in my life have I smelt a
candle like this it is so freakin good
so I live in a
no and like I have two stories until you
get down to my front door and every
single time someone opens at my front
door they're like oh my god it smells
good in here and I'm like oh like it is
so potent like it's one of those candles
it has two weeks and you can light it
for only no joke ten to twenty minutes
and blow out and your house is going to
smell like that candle for the next five
to six hours it is so strong and they're
just so amazing okay so to finish off my
favorites I have two perfumes I want to
mention and they're both very similar to
one another actually the first one is
the Miss Dior this is just the original
Monsieur I believe I am a huge do your
fan of like your perfumes Dior like Miss
sherry is that what it's called my Dior
blooming bouquet blooming bouquet I've
gone through like three bottles of it I
love those perfumes but this one I
recently picked up I would say two maybe
three months ago and I have to spend in
love with it and John loves it too it's
definitely an evening scent it's a scent
that I feel like I spray on when I've
want to feel like sexy and sexual like
when we're going out on a date this is
the scent that I will spray it's just so
like romantic and I love it and it's
weird if I feel like I'm growing up
because never in my life would I ever
have thought that I would like a
fragrance like this because it just
seems so like mature you know what I'm
saying but like I don't know I've just
been loving this I wish that could
describe it to you guys and let you
smell it that's what I hate about
talking about perfumes over the Internet
the next one I cannot believe that I am
matching this perfume right now because
this is just the weirdest moment for me
because my sister used to wear this
perfume so much for like five years this
is my sister's signature scent so any
time I would smell us all I would think
about was Rachael and I couldn't get out
of my head
but she has not worn it out for a long
time not to mention we don't live in the
same state anymore
so I no longer smell it and think of her
but it's just weird it's like if this is
just so my sister sent but anyways I
have fallen in love with it and it is
the Coco Mademoiselle coke it's by
Chanel
so it's Coco Chanel Mademoiselle perfume
it is just such a it's what I'm wearing
right now it is such a warm again
sexy nighttime scent it just smells like
your old woman like you know what I'm
saying it's not a little girl perfume it
just smells like
that's a woman these super fumes
definitely have a similar vibe I don't
think that you need both of them by any
means I think that you could just do one
or the other I think this one is a tiny
bit sweeter and this one is like a
little bit more deep if you know what I
mean they're both so good though I go
back and forth like crazy they have been
my two favorite perfumes recently so
yeah I thought I'd share them with you
all right so those are all my favorites
for the month of July I hope that you
guys enjoy this video hopefully you had
a great month of July it was such a
crazy month for me but so much fun it
was my birthday month I had friends and
family into town I had the best
meet-and-greet of my life so it was a
very fun successful month if you asked
me so fingers crossed for August this
month is gonna be absolutely insanity
but I'm gonna get through it I'm gonna
power through so thank you so much for
watching as always leave me your
favorites in the comments section down
below so I can check out what it is that
you guys have been loving and see if
there's anything that I need to add to
my collection as if I need more makeup
right thank you so much for watching I
love you guys and I'll see you soon bye

savor it but I can't I GAD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
