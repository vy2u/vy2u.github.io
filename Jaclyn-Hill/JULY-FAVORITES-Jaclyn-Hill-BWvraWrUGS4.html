hat right at home camera I know it's a
little weird but I was going to be
honest with you I could not do the top
of my hair today because I broke my hand
so because I broke my hand I could not
get the top of my hair done I was
straightening the rest of my hair and
because straightening didn't hurt his
back is curling it and it just started
hurting so bad that I was like I can't
do it and instead of coming on camera
with my hair all messed up and it hurts
put my hair up in a bun and my it just
sucks having your right hand broken just
sucks everything hurts so I just thought
okay I'm gonna just put the pain aside
and just put on a hat and you guys will
love me for me I know a lot of you are
going to be asking me how I broke my
hand because we're all Curious George's
so I was hanging out my husband messing
around showed him how hard I could punch
punch the headboard of my bed which is
like a squishy tufted headboard punched
it really hard way too hard and cracked
a bone down my hand so the doctor told
me that's going to take four or six
weeks to heal and I have to keep it
wrapped up I'm not supposed to use it
for anything but it is what it is so
let's get started first thing I want to
talk about is the urban decay chill
makeup setting spray I love this setting
spray because it is cooling and
hydrating so when you spray on in the
warm months it really gives you your
skin this awesome refreshed feeling
where it's just like oh I absolutely
love it I wish I could spray it on all
day long but that would cost a lot of
money um it really does work though it's
not like something like mac fix+ wear
that one just gives your skin like a
dewy look and doesn't really set the
makeup this honestly sets it and keeps
it on and makes it continue to look the
same and fresh for hours so love love
love Urban Decay
makeup setting spray and then the Josie
Maran bare naked wipes this is something
that took me a long time to buy because
I think it was $15 for this pack and
normally I use I think their ponds I
think the ones I use our ponds they're
like in a lavender and white packaging
from the drugstore and it's like the
nighttime something but I believe it's
ponds um I love those now it was hard
for me to buy this because it was $15
but I find
did it oh my hand I finally did it
though and I will say that I really
really love them because of the way they
leave my skin feeling you can really
feel the good ingredients and then as
opposed to most makeup wipes your skin
just feels so taken care of and
nourished and silky and smooth but the
downside is they do not remove all of
your makeup you really have to scrub
your face with these wipes to get
everything to be removed which I don't
like doing because you're being really
rough on your skin
okay sticking with josie maran i'm going
to talk about one more products this is
the 100% pure argan oil with radiance
totally random by the way I keep my
things in boxes and their packaging for
as long as possible I know I can't be
the only one that does this but it just
feels so new then I'm like oh I pull it
out and I use it then I put it right
back in because I just I love new
packaging and I just love the way it
looks I'll be careful if you guys know
that you have a sensitivity to lavender
you're not going to like this because it
does have lavender and honey scent in it
and lavender can be an irritant but it's
the exact same thing as the original
argan oil but it has a shimmer in it and
it's not like a tacky shimmer but it
makes your skin just look very refreshed
and dewy I would say so when you put it
on it looks like this I don't know if
you can see it but we'll rub it in see
with the camera will pick up and okay so
you can see that and I love this because
for during the day I will take this now
I am very dry so if you guys are oily at
all and it's summertime you're going to
be like girl you are crazy but I am dry
as a bone
even in the middle of summer so I will
take it and put it on my cheeks out put
it everywhere
other than my t-zone because if I do put
an oil like that on my t-zone
then my makeup is just going to slide
right off that area I'll take a little
bit of it and put it on my cheeks and
I'll go with my foundation and it'll
just give such a beautiful dewy glow
it's my foundation which I love because
I'm
once again so right okay let's talk
about lips got a bunch of random lip
products here and I just absolutely
adore so this right here person to talk
about Lime Crime this is the line prime
Velveteen this is a red lip gloss but it
dries to a matte finish I'm sure you
guys have heard about it here on YouTube
before it is so beautiful it is such a
gorgeous perfect matte retro red so you
can see how pigmented it is and it
drives to a complete and total matte
shade so gorgeous so all you to do is
line your lips with a red lip liner and
then go in and put this on over top it
is amazing like the truest red of all
time I love love this okay and then
another line kind the product that I
love is this lipstick right here I lose
my lap using my last video it's called
Coquette so first of all I just want to
say like shout out to Lime Crime for
their packaging it is the cutest
packaging of all time with the little
unicorn on it I I love it just for the
packaging and this right here is such a
gorgeous nude it reminds me of like
creme Cup and shy girl by Mac mixed
together it's so pretty it's like the
most beautiful pinky beige color it's
not as a nude that is not too nude like
anyone can pretty much wear this nude
it's not like myth or creme de nude
which are all MAC lipsticks I'm
referring to right now if such a
beautiful nude I absolutely love it
looks gorgeous on so many different skin
colors amazing next totally random this
is from bareMinerals I went into the
bareMinerals store because I was just
walking around and bored and my mom was
like I haven't looked into bare minerals
in years so he walked in
I saw this lipstick and was like mine so
this is called mock wait moxie marvelous
Moxie is the name of the lipstick and
this is called speak your mind so the
packaging is interesting it just looks
like this and you take this little
silver thing and pull it wait what do
you do yeah you push it up they pull out
so everything down and that unlocks it
this my niece was playing with it and
like chipped off the top gotta love her
and this right here reminds me a lot of
cream Cup with just a little bit more
pigment and as you can tell I love my
news I always have it always will I
don't like my lipsticks to neut I always
want some color on the lips I don't like
that white washed out look on me
personally but I absolutely love this
color both of these they're so so pretty
alright next oh my gosh okay so I'm
going to talk about the lipstick that
I'm wearing right now it is the new
lipstick by Urban Decay it is called
anarchy these lipsticks are absolutely
amazing I don't have to swatch it for
you guys obviously it's on my lips but
oh my gosh
I walk into Sephora a couple days ago
and saw these new lipsticks and lip
liners out and was local yep just like
that these I picked up these two because
I love this color right here I think it
is so pretty it is very different I
honestly don't think well I'm sure I do
own something similar to it to it but I
don't own anything when I looked at it
that I was like oh I have that so I had
to get this color because I loved it so
much and then once again I also got
another nude which you guys are probably
thinking you don't need any more of
these exact same colors get a life but I
really do I love them and I love all the
different consistencies and I just love
testing out lipsticks
lipsticks are one of my favorite
favorite beauty products so I did a
ginormous swatch for you guys right
there it is so pretty once again I think
this is such a universal shade you can
put on a really pink lip gloss with this
and really amp it up you can mix it red
with it you can put a more new gloss on
top of it and make it way more nude I
just love these colors I love that has a
little bit of gloss in it it's
moisturizing and it stains your lips
like when I take this off tonight my
lips will still be this color until
tomorrow morning no joke these are
amazing lipsticks lipsticks Urban Decay
did a great job
love you guys okay next we're going to
talk about a sigma brush I mentioned
this before in my videos I can't get
enough of this brush right now you guys
I have switched out this brush for my
mac 242 brush which I've always talked
about being like my holy girl I shadow
brush this one has replaced it I when I
first got this I never really thought I
would love it I just kind of thought
like oh okay but sorry I'm not getting
so close together I just love this so
much I use it every single day to pack
on that color on the lid so like all
that shimmery color on my lid right now
is what I use this brush for this is the
e55 eyes shading brush by Sigma and
actually this is the perfect time for me
to be talking to you guys about this
because Sigma is offering a 20% discount
code until Monday I don't know if it
ends on Sunday night or if it ends on
Monday night I think it ends on Monday
night but I will have the information
for that the discount code below and a
link for you guys so 20% off another
thing we have is a Nastasia brow pencil
and soft brown this is the brow Wiz I
don't know if I have talked about this
before I actually love it it has two
ends it's great it has a spoolie on one
end where you can comb through your
brows to prepare them or blend them out
I love love how much of a fine point
this brow is has it is such a fine point
V it it's not very breakable it's never
broken on me before
unlike Mac's brow pencils like the
lingering and the spite they break so
easy if you accidentally twist it up to
there it's going to break on you this
one will not it is not weak it goes on
like butter I love it so much soft brown
is such a universe
gorgeous gorgeous shade I have it in my
kit I use soft brown on pretty much
everyone loved this brow pencil so
awesome alright quickly I just want to
say to you I use this in my last video
this is the makeup geek afterglow
pigments if you want to see what it
looks like you can go to that video I
will link it below because this stuff
will get all over me next thing you know
and it's gonna be a hot but it is
absolutely gorgeous gorgeous pigment I
use it literally all the time to the
point that I'm like okay Jacqueline
you've got to start using other products
because the last two weeks I had
probably no joke use it five five to
seven times I'm wearing it today so I
cannot get enough of it I think it sold
out right now because I was freaking out
about it in my last video I will put the
link below again though it's called
afterglow so gorgeous love this is by
kevin a quan totally random I've seen it
for a very long time at Nordstrom never
purchased it because like $30 and I was
just like oh but it is beautiful I was
reading a blog a couple of months ago
and the kardashians makeup artist was
saying that this is the only highlighter
that he ever uses on Khloe Kardashian
because she is so oily and this is the
only highlighter it doesn't emphasize
her oil and doesn't make it look worse
and it's not too yellow and it's not too
silver it's just perfect so when I saw
that I was immediately drawn like oh
okay I need this for my clients um and I
just absolutely love it you can see
right here I hope the camera is picking
it up it's right here on my hand maybe I
should put a tiny bit more but it is
just an absolutely gorgeous gorgeous
highlighter like he said it's not too
yellow not too gold
not too silver it's not pink it is
perfect absolutely gorgeous it is so
fine
there's no glitter there's no chunky
sparkles in it it just goes on so smooth
it goes on like whipped cream just like
ah so fluffy so light
go Kevin upline okay a couple more
things I want to talk about the L'Oreal
voluminous full definition I have used
this mascara and a lot of my videos
recently you guys are always asking what
it is
I always list it down below oh my gosh
you guys I have invested in so many
high-end mascaras just to find out that
this is my favorite mascara in the world
and it's like six bucks so this is what
the wand looks like right here it is so
basic let me tell you I have extremely
skinny lashes I got them from my mom my
mom my cousins my aunts we all have
these skinny lashes they're all a longer
side but they're just so skinny and
it'll click spider legs everything makes
them look like spider legs this is the
only mascara actually I've ever used in
my life that I can just pile on the
coats and it just makes them thick and
not clumpy and just it makes it so
voluminous it is ridiculous this is like
my dream mascara it is so amazing I wish
I invented it
go L'Oreal and you I love you for a
reason such amazing mascara I have to
give a shout out to my favorite perfumes
of the month I actually got this one for
my birthday it's old school I have this
back in the day when I was like 17 years
old but I still love it this is the DKNY
be Delicious intense I just love it so
much I think it's such a fruity summery
smell oh if you guys like really fruit
not really fruity I shouldn't say but
like clean fresh kind of like dolce
gabbana like blue scents just things
that smell not florally and not super
sweet but just clean I'll just like
clean summer day I love it so much I
love that smell so I always want my
house to smell like I always want
everything to smell just clean and fresh
but not like laundry you know what I
mean okay and then one more
I showed this in a video a couple videos
ago this is called falling in love by
philosophy and this is the summer love
edition so it's the
our love is unforgettable so good this
one is much more on the sweet side much
more this one reminds me more of
something like um Taylor Swift's perfume
or Nicki Minaj's perfume but classier
than that I don't know if that makes
sense
but it doesn't smell um it doesn't smell
like a little girl doesn't smell like
cheap gosh I'm making everything I'm
just making them sound bad but this I'm
really bad at describing it
I can leave notes down at the bottom bar
if you want me to it is so good it's
like clean and fresh but floral and
sweet it's everything I love it but
whenever I wear people are always
complimenting me does they need me
curling wand I love all nume curling
wands I think they're absolutely
phenomenal this one in particular is
awesome this is the 19 millimeter wand
right here it gives such great tight
Beach curls but not too tight it's so
amazing because it literally holds the
curl for three days when I curl my hair
with this I don't do anything other than
just kind of move it around with my
fingers for the next two or three days
it holds the curl for so long it looks
so beachy and so just carefree and it's
got so much volume in it I love love
love this um any video that you see any
pictures you see of me in the last month
or so with my hair curled it is from
this wand I get a lot of questions about
it so the same one I used and I get
ready with me video to add some texture
in my hair before I put my hair in a fun
um I still do have my discount code for
this it is magic new me I will put it in
the description bar below and you can
use that to get 110 dollars off of the
price not to mention it's on sale right
now so you can get $110 off the sale
price which is crazy a face mask from
lush this is called ot fix I don't know
I'm not sure but it's oatmeal this is a
brand new one I just got yesterday
because I use the other one up this one
needs to be used by August 12 so I've
got to get on it I absolutely love this
it's for dry skin it seriously just
hydrates and just replenishes the skin I
apply it probably I would say two times
a week for just three weeks and then
it's gone I put a generous amount on
because you do have to use it up within
a month well I don't have a month I have
so I put a generous amount on I leave it
on for about 15 minutes wash off my face
my face just feel so nourished and
healthy and glowing and hydrated
it's amazing one more thing I just
wanted to run here for Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
wait not that Bath &amp;amp; Beyond Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works up they are doing there - 422
candle till right now that they do all
the time um they are really seeing like
a preview of their false sense right now
and then they have like a goodie bag if
you spend like 50 bucks or something you
can qualify this for this big bag of
stuff for $20 um so yeah I just thought
I'd let you guys know because anytime
any of these candles come out I always
grab the 2 for 22 deal and stock up on
at least two to four because they're so
awesome
I have lakeside and summertime s'mores
here they're so yummy love them so much
