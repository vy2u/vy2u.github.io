June beauty favorites and I'm so happy
to be filming this because I missed last
month's video and it was totally
unintentional that I missed last month's
favorites but honestly time has been
going so ridiculously fast recently that
it was just like the month was just like
I missed my window of opportunity to
film my favorites video I cannot believe
that it's July it's July 1st right now I
cannot believe this this is my birthday
month my birthday is on July 20th and I
feel like I just celebrated my 24th
birthday like two months ago and I'm
like wait turned 25 already like what is
happening it's just it's insane how fast
this past year has gone it's like the
fastest year of my whole life time flies
when you're having fun right so because
I missed last month's favorites video
that basically means I have two months
of products backed up here in front of
me I have a lot to talk about and a
short amount of time so go pour yourself
a glass of wine oh my god that rod so
many ropes snaps her neck but seriously
grab yourself a little snack because
this is gonna be a long video there's
gonna be a good one
Lego so this is definitely my number one
favorite of the whole month and I also
think my number one favorite of the year
you know what possibly this is the most
favorite thing in my life so far this is
the highlighter that I collaborated with
Becca cosmetics to create and it is
called champagne pop oh my god you guys
just saying those words it's so surreal
holy the holy moly I really don't know
who I am what I've done - like deserve
this it's just it just seems like too
much it's just crazy so first thing is
first huh I'm going to throw up
this is what the outer packaging looks
like right here it is a kind of coppery
gold shade and then it has like little
water droplets on the actual packaging
which is supposed to go along with the
theme of champagne because it is named
champagne pop so that's why those water
droplets are there and then on the
packaging it says Becca and then it has
my signature underneath and yeah I just
like literally signed a piece of paper
and then I expand to out of the box and
I was like I don't have a pretty
signature but it's there then on the
back I have like a little statement
about the product a photo of yours truly
Rouge comes with the photo axe
look like like I would be a better
representation of me but sometimes you
gotta play glamorous so as far as the
actual highlighter goes it comes in the
exact same packaging is all other Becca
highlights and it is also the same
formulation is all other Becca
highlights I only created the color and
the concept behind champagne pop not the
actual formulation it's staying true to
the Becca formula that we all know and
love but this is a limited edition
product even though it is in the same
packaging as always so when you open it
up there just a plastic protector right
here with Becca's logo and then my
signature and then here the edge hey
babe took my badge of armor hi lovely
Hey so I'm wearing champagne pop today
obviously and this has honestly been the
highlight that I've been wearing for the
past four months straight unless it's
been a tutorial where I haven't been
able to use this because it can't talk
about it yet this is all I have been
wearing for the past four months because
I received the original one four months
ago but just had to wait and wait and
wait to talk about it so yeah I am in
love with this to say the least
I am rain matte blush and a matte
bronzer and I have this on a cheeks the
inner corner of the eye and the brow
bone so you can see the shade right
there to my vision behind champagne pop
was to create a color that's going to
give a very wide range of skin tones the
ability to achieve a summertime very
golden glow without being too Brown too
muddy to bronze because I didn't want
someone who's very fair to BL I wish
that would look good on me but it
doesn't cuz it's too beige and it looks
dirty on my face my sister really her
skin tone was what I kept in mind
because my sister has the hardest time
finding a highlight that actually shows
up or actually looks pretty on her
because her skin is truly the shade of
milk she's so fair and so when this
color looked beautiful on her
I was like done nailed it I will go
ahead and link my sister's blogpost she
did a review on this and she just posted
it this morning and she shows swatches
of champagne pop along with Becca opal
and Becca moonstone so I know a lot of
you guys are asking what this looks like
in comparison so I'll link that down
below and if I
any other blog post with swatches I will
link those as well for you guys so you
can see what this looks like compared to
the other shades in case you already own
those I will definitely tell you that
champagne pop has much more of a pale
golden shade compared to opal is more at
a beige and move so it is more of a
white vanilla so this is definitely more
of a golden color oh my baby excited I
hope you guys enjoy it even if you don't
I'm just so excited in the fact that I
collaborate with Becca cosmetics I can't
even deal with this I wish you guys
could have been there so bad at our
initial meeting last year I just wish
you guys could have I could have had a
camera or you kind of could just be
there with me the things that Becca were
saying about my subscribers and just
like the family that I have built here
on YouTube in the relationship it's just
so kind and so sweet and they're just
really good people and it's been an
amazing experience and thank you so much
to you guys I just I love you so much so
thank you for your encouragement and
this is happening because of you so yeah
I love you and thank you so let's move
on to surreal and you take a deep breath
before I can move on this next product I
am so excited to talk about because I
raved about it in the past few videos
but I haven't actually gone in depth
about it and this is the LC micro silk
foundation Lilith who is also known as
makeup by Lilly on Instagram and I will
link her down below for you guys she is
the creator and the owner of this brand
which is just I personally feel like
this foundation is it the best
foundation I've ever used for all of
humanity and I know that sounds so silly
but what I mean by that is if I was
still freelancing and I was still doing
Brides every single weekend I would have
this foundation and every single color
in my kit and call it a day it is so
beautiful it is a natural matte finish
it does not sell on fine lines and
wrinkles amazing it doesn't crease I
live in the humidity of Florida it is
like nasty swampland out here and at the
end of the day my foundation is always
melted it's always just kind of sitting
on my skin like take me off I'm done
this foundation doesn't look like that
this foundation honest to God looks just
as beautiful eight hours in as it did
when I first put it on I don't know if
it's technically long wearing but it's
long wearing on me it is just beautiful
because I am dry
we'll use like mac fix+ or some
Centreville some sort of like dewy skin
spray to kind of make this a little bit
more luminous because I like my
foundation to have a little bit of a
glow but that's what makes it sound a
shion's so great is if you are more oily
this foundation will be great for you if
your normal would be great for you and
if you're dry I'll be great for you you
can make this work no matter what your
needs are it's just beautiful and the
most exciting part is that Lillet saw me
raving about this foundation in my last
video and she emailed me and she wants
to offer my subscribers a discount code
for the whole month of July which is
ridiculously generous you guys because
like I said she's doing this on her own
this is her new company this is an
amazing product she doesn't need to
offer discount code but she is she is
just so sweet and she was just so kind
and so thankful that I liked her
foundation that she wanted to offer you
guys a discount code so I will link that
down below for you guys it'll last for
the month of July so 30 days for you
guys make sure that if you use it you
give her a thank you because it's just
so sweet of her so again I will link
that all down below her Instagram the
product and the discount code along with
everything else you need to know I
actually had one more foundation to talk
about not as much to say about this as I
did about the LC um but this was
actually purchased because of
kathleenlights I saw her using it in a
video and I was like okay that looks
amazing even though she makes everything
look amazing I'm still gonna buy it this
is by the brand bourgeois and I actually
found this on ASOS calm I know that's so
random but that's where I found it and I
just guess my color online and I guess I
got lucky and I was right so I in the
shade 55 beige and it's like the perfect
shade for me umm this is called the
healthy mix serum foundation it is a gel
foundation and it says it's a 16 hour
radiance boosting foundation it's a
pretty basic foundation in the sense
that if you are dry you're going to love
it it does last a long time on the skin
and it feels like a moisturizer it's
very dewy it's very luminous it
definitely gives a radiant glow but it
is not shiny or sparkly or glittery over
the top it's just beautiful so if you're
dry or normal and looking for that
radiance I highly recommend this it is
like my favorites
radiant foundation right now like as
opposed to giorgio armani luminous silk
which you know is like my mabini
bourgeois
gorgeous I said to quickly mention the
mac fix+ they came out with a few
limited edition sense this month they
came out with a cucumber a rose a
lavender a coconut and there's someone
else like there was another one that
can't remember and I only own the
coconut for now but I am going to go
purchase the cucumber because that just
sounds amazing and refreshing but I have
been loving this it's just a simple idea
but it's just brilliant because for a
product you use all the time it just
makes it so refreshing and it makes it
like an experience and you girls are
always looking for experiences right and
that's what this is it's the same fix
plus as why did I squeeze the spray come
back to Bob Bob it's the same fix plus
as always it just has the scent in it I
was nervous that it was going to break
me out because sometimes things that are
scented can make my skin sensitive
because I am so ridiculously sensitive
it's insane I love this though it smells
like coconut it smells like you're just
on the beach and every time you spray
your face you're just like yes you feel
special so I have been loving this this
month this is the tatcha luminous dewy
skin mist and I did talk about this in
my last video and I mentioned on
snapchat but again I will admit I'm
guilty I purchased this only because Kim
Kardashian uses it and I was like mmhmm
not even thinking about it just purchase
yeah mine it is expensive but worth
every penny I've never used a product
like this in my life it is so
moisturizing it makes your skin so
luminous and so DUII
I will spray this on my face with no
makeup no foundation whatsoever and my
skin just looks gorgeous like and it's
all because of this if I self tan the
night before the next day I won't wear
makeup and I will just spritz this and I
truly feel like I'm just glowing and you
can't believe how many people haven't
made comments to me in public even my
own family members asking me did you
change your skincare routine what did
you do why just skin looks so beautiful
today I'm like oh my god it's the skin
earnest so if you are dry or normal and
you're looking for a glow and you're
looking for luminosity it's this right
here the only negative about this
product is I did spray it on my face
after I had completed my entire full
face of makeup and my mascara on the top
did transfer to that hood area of my lid
up there and because it does have that
luminous dewy property it's going to
contain
ille nut oils obviously what's making it
transfer and spread so now I spray this
in the beginning of my makeup or I spray
it before I apply mascara wait a minute
and then go in that was just my
experience though you may not not have
that issue but I did so that's how I've
been using it and it works perfect for
me I showed this in my Sephora haul and
I have fallen in love with it this past
weekend so this is a terracotta spray by
Guerlain this is a bronzing powder mist
with sunscreen of an SPF 10 so when I
went away this weekend um I went up to
the U P in Michigan on a family reunion
I literally brought the tiniest bag of
makeup you've ever seen because like who
needs makeup up there in the woods you
know I'm saying I literally brought like
mascara this like lip gloss and
foundation that's all I brought it was
ridiculous and I felt like such a dude
so I had the shade 0-2 medium and the
way I was using this on my trip was
actually with no foundation whatsoever I
would take the top child luminous dewy
skin and I would just give it a little
spritz just to make my skin look
slightly alive because up there it is so
freakin dry my skin looked like a zombie
it was just crepey and dead and lifeless
and then I would take this and I would
spray it onto this angled morphe brush
this is the e4 which I use for blush but
I was also using it for this bronzer
when I was up there so I would spritz it
on this brush and then I would just take
it and put it on the cheeks the forehead
the chin and just lightly bronze my face
and I was done and when I would put this
on my sister we always been oh my gosh
Jaclyn you just look alive I would come
downstairs with just this and mascara
and she did it's amazing what the
smallest makeup can do and it just makes
you look fresh and bronzy in such a
natural way so that's why I love this
because you can use it without makeup so
if you're someone who wants the bare
minimum I totally get it especially in
the summertime this is a great product
because you can just spritz it on your
brush on bare skin and it blends
beautifully a lot of bronzers you need
to have a base of foundation or powder
for it to really blend nicely this
doesn't need it it can go on bare skin
and it just blends so flawless and
smoothly so that is the terra cotta
spray by Guerlain girl in Guerlain girl
in Guerlain house of lashes iconic
lashes oh my gosh you guys know that I
have been in love with these recently
you have no idea these are my favorite
lashes right now I know that I am super
late on the bandwagon
the second that I pull
they're on Instagram how much I love
these lashes so many people were
commenting like really Jacqueline you're
just not falling in love with these like
welcome to the show
this has been happening for a while but
I just absolutely love these I have
quite a few photos on Instagram of me
wearing them I've used them in a few
tutorials I swear I can't get sick of
them I wear them with liner without
liner I just I love them they just make
your eyes look so open and just big
they're bold in all the right ways
they're spiky and they're fluffy
I just I love them House of lashes
iconic lashes
I am so overjoyed that Mac finally did
this and they created a lipstick in the
shade
whirl is one of their most popular lip
liners he'll it's a matte topee brown
lipstick I believe it is going to be
limited edition Mountain when we pull
them but I am worn this three times this
month and I just love it I wore this in
a snapchat about two weeks ago and I was
flooded with questions of what lip color
I was wearing and I was respond to them
on Twitter and Instagram telling you
that it was whirl by Mac but if you were
one of the people who were wondering
that's exactly what I was wearing I've
worn this three times this month and I
just love it it's just such a great kind
of dark brown e mauve shade it's whirl
its world lip liner but in a lipstick
it's kylie jenner's color you know what
I'm saying this is the color that she
wears all the time that people love so
much right here I've been loving it I am
so happy to be talking about these next
products this is a new line called hot
Huff's house of dolls I'm sorry it's not
house but it's H aus so Hoff's of dolls
and this line was created by a fellow
youtuber her name is Natalie and I am so
happy for her because I have been
watching Natalie's videos since before I
even turned on a camera and even thought
about creating my own videos which is
crazy and I remember I sent her like a
private message before I ever even got
on YouTube and just told her that her
highlight was beautiful and she
responded to me and was like oh thanks
so much we talked about how we both
worked at Mac and she was just so kind
and I'll never forget that and so I've
been subscribed to her ever since and I
followed her ever since because she's
just such a doll and now she their own
lipstick line you guys
all Haas of dolls and I am so excited
and I just want to show my support to
this she only has four lipsticks so far
but they are four beautiful lipsticks
and she did do this all on her own she
says that she has no investors that she
didn't have anyone controlling her this
is all her and her dream which is just
so amazing I know how hard it is to do
this oh my gosh so I am so happy for her
and so just so proud like she did this
is just amazing so the packaging is
adorable like it stands like this I'm
like it's little gold pedestal stumpy
and then it comes out like this this is
my favorite shade this is what I'm
wearing on my lips right now and this is
called she beautiful nude lipstick it's
just so pigmented it has such an awesome
smell it smells like an old school like
Mary Kay lipstick and I'm saying that
because I love that scent so much it
just smells good
very pigmented very moisturizing they're
just beautiful beautiful colors and then
this one is called cake Killa
love this shade it's like a bright coral
kind of fuchsia it's just sexy it is
gorgeous especially for a summer so so
happy for Natalie I will link awesome
dolls and I will link her Instagram down
below and her youtube so you guys can
check her out and her promotion and
marketing for this stuff as well so yeah
you go Natalie I'm so so happy for you
so Matt came out with a new eyeshadow
formula and the second I saw them I was
like mm-hmm
and my friend who still works at Mac she
texts me and she told me that I needed
all of them and I was like done trust
you these are they new dazzle shadows so
they're kind of similar like the matte
pressed pigment in the sense that
they're just extremely glittery but
what's really cool about these is
they're kind of 3-dimensional in the
sense that they have two shades in one
so like the one that I am wearing on my
lid right now recently I have been like
obsessed with turquoise and blues and
greens as eyeshadow it's like my new
thing right now so it's happening
I am wearing try me on and the one that
I am wearing is like a turquoise and a
yellow combined so like when you're
looking at it close up you can see the
flecks of yellow and turquoise it's just
so beautiful a beautiful concept
beautiful colors and
my other two favorites are let's roll
which is like a cranberry orange e pinky
shade again they have different colors
it's like see how it goes from like
orange to cranberry so cool and then
this one is called I like to watch and
it's kind of a weird name at that look I
have this one goes from like a lime
yellowy green to like a kind of burgundy
ish purpley color they're so cool they
do have tons of Fallout when you're
applying them though to be honest so I
would recommend applying them before you
apply your foundation or using a glitter
glue so that they don't fall over your
cheeks when you're working with them but
they are so gorgeous I own almost all of
them because they're just they're so
cool I don't know if these are
limited-edition or not though I do even
look I'm not as and I'm not as in tune
with Mac as I used to be since I used to
work there I used to like you know know
everything about them I don't as much
anymore I wish I did but I will list all
that information down there in the
description I am so late talking about
these I feel like every one of their
mother has talked about these recently
except me but at least I'm talking about
them now
these are d more feet elite brushes and
I'm sure that some of you are probably
like oh here we go again
but the reason that you're hearing so
many people talk about these brushes is
because they are seriously ridiculously
amazing I want them to come out with
like tons of other styles in this same
collection because they are honestly
some of the best brushes I've ever used
in my life and these are my favorites
from the collection I'm holding right
here in my hand
so this angled one which I technically
call a contour brush this is what I've
been using as a blush brush this is the
e for you guys best blush brush I've
ever used in my life just saying best
brush ever like I've never used a blush
brush that works better than that one
but I will also use this for bronzer as
well so you can use it for whatever you
want but blush it's like amazing just a
gigantic brush I will use this for
bronzer if you are a powder girl this
will be perfect is that power that whole
face like you do I have doing things big
done it so
gigantic I'll use this for bronzer and
then I'll also use it down here to kind
of blend everything together it's just a
massive brush that is so nice and dense
but still fluffy and blendable at the
same time and this is the e one and then
these three eye brushes I just can't
live without now that I had them in my
life this is the e 22 the blending brush
this is what I use today for my entire
crease I've been using it like crazy
this pencil brush right here this is the
e 18 I've been using this underneath my
eye as my go-to pencil brush in this
little tiny baby right here this is the
e 36 and I have been using this for
inner corner highlight done done and
done and I have heard a few people
recently making accusations and just
kind of like speculating that I'm only
talking about morphe because I want to
make money and I just want to shut that
down right now and remind you guys I am
never going to talk about any brand or
any product ever ever in my life
that I do not absolutely love people can
offer me $100,000 and I'm going to say
absolutely not if I do not 100% believe
in a product I was raised in the way
lying is just the worst thing that you
can do I was very very badly disciplined
for lying when I was a little girl and I
learned my lesson real quick I will
never lie to you guys
my relationship with my subscribers is
the most important thing to me more than
Fame more than money more than anything
in the world I don't care about those
things as much as I care about having an
honest relationship with my subscribers
and I hope that that comes through and
shows in my videos and just please keep
in mind that every single brand I am an
affiliate with every single brand I have
like a code with or a relationship with
it's because I discovered their products
and then they discovered me more if you
did not know who I was until I was
writing about their products and then
they reached out to me and said hey we
want to make you an affiliate and give
you a discount code for your subscribers
done just keep that in mind I will never
sell out for money I'm never going to
lie to you these videos are always 100%
honesty so just keep that in mind so
these brushes are incredible some of the
best that I have ever used and I'm just
being honest so last but certainly not
least now that we've been sitting here
for 45 minutes is the Laura Mercier
translucent powder I just discovered
this may be four to five weeks in
and I have been absolutely in love with
it this is very popular in the beauty
community right now everybody is using
this powder to bake or cook their face
I'm sure you guys have seen this method
it started in the drag world it has now
transferred over to the beauty world and
it's just a way of making your makeup
sit and stay and last longer and be
sweat proof and basically bulletproof
it's your bit your armor on your face is
what baking and cooking basically means
um I have been loving this for many many
reasons the way it makes your makeup
stay and not move I use this to clean up
my contour so if I grab like a big old
powder brush and go in I will then take
the translucent powder and just kind of
go along the bottom of my cheeks go
along the top of my cheekbones just kind
of clean up any messy bronzer or contour
and it's just absolutely beautiful it's
the only transition powder that I've
ever actually liked because all their
transits a powder is leave like a white
cast or they just feel so strange and on
the skin and they make my face look kind
of creepy but this one is not the
typical translucent powder and it
actually has a little bit of color in it
just a little bit it's like a little bit
of a vanilla base to it it's gorgeous
I've had I recommended it to tons of
like personal family and friends and
they all loved it it's just great so
that is the Laura Mercier translucent
powder all right you guys so that
completes this video I am so sorry if it
was seriously 45 minutes long this took
me forever to film but honestly though
I've learned my lesson
bad Jacqueline I'm never skipping a
month again this is what happens when I
skip a month I have to pile everything
together but I hope that you guys
enjoyed it and as always leave me your
