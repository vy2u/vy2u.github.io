to be doing at my June beauty favorites
I have so much to talk about like this
much like my desk is filled but like
this entire section with products to
talk about so this is gonna be a long
one so strap in grab yourself get
yourself a whole meal okay because at
this point it's probably gonna be like
45 minutes long I have been fighting a
cold the past couple of days something
my eye so if my voice sounds kind of
nasally I'm trying to get over it my
head is like it's the headache and like
the sinuses that just won't let go and
like looking at these lights right now I
feel like I'm just like oh my head so if
I seem like I'm like talking me and I'm
like how masses because of my head cold
so anyway let's just stop babbling we
got a lot of ground to cover so let's
just jump in alright so the first thing
I want to talk about is a collaboration
with a fellow youtuber that I am
absolutely in love with look how dirty
this case is so these are the key which
I've called them quai for like ever but
recently found out they're called key
these are the key sunglasses in
collaboration with Miss desi Perkins and
I showed these in one of my previous
videos mine are getting him trying so
hard not to get them like scratched up
or anything because I know that they're
like sold out costly so might know him
as well as like in pairs so I am
absolutely in love with these I showed
them in a recent video I'm gonna try to
look this way that way like I don't
blind you with the lights but are these
not like the coolest gold aviators
they're so flat they're so over sized
like I am so in love with them and
they're a very reasonable price I just
think they're like some of the dopest
sunglasses ever honestly like I'm a
sunglass junkie I love sunglasses and
recently these have been my go-to for
the entire month over any other pair
that I have I have been grabbing these
they're so beautiful and does he
announced on her snapchat that her and
ki are actually going to be extending
the collaboration and coming out with
these in another color and I immediately
what I saw that I text her and I guess
the color and she was like you got it
right and I was like yes girl so I
wait for her new color coming out I
think it's in August um but these are
called the hi keys I of course will find
them and link them down below for you
guys but they're just like I love these
sunglasses so much let's talk about lips
because I've been having some like major
love affair with some lip products this
past month the first one is very
expensive and I'm sure that there's a
million dupes out there for this because
honestly like what lipstick is really
truly worth this price but in my mind I
can justify any makeup product it
doesn't matter what it is this is a Tom
Ford lipstick in the shade
nude I've talked about this before in a
video and I swear you guys and this is
my all-time favorite nude color now I
like a pinky nude a lot of people like
more brown nude and I know like that
Mavi nude is really like on trend
recently but I just I can't help but
just love this pinky pale nude I just
think it's so flattering on my skintone
personally these lipsticks are so opaque
they're so creamy there's they are a
beautiful formula are they worth $50
Brava Lena but again I will doesn't buy
anything I ran out of my original one
like probably six to eight months ago
and I repurchase it earlier this month
and like I can't put it down
it is like my go-to lipstick so if
you're in the mood for you know selling
your soul for a lipstick I would suggest
the blush new by Tom Ford next is a
gloss I've been in love with now this
one is mini because Anastacio sent this
out in a PR package but I'm assuming
that they have it in full size I don't
think this was like a limited edition
thing um I think they have it in full
size but this has been my favorite gloss
for the month of June and this is in
shade toffee I've mentioned a million
times that I love the anastacio glosses
and they're more of like a really really
opaque more like thick full coverage
gloss like this right here and they
smell oh this smells like marshmallow
fluff like just that marshmallow cupcake
II like it just smells so good ever
since of my apply apps like I can't jump
on board Foley was like these brown nude
shades I just don't feel like I think
they make me look kind of like sick
almost at times but this one I just
absolutely love for some reason I think
it's so beautiful so again that is Tuffy
Tuffy not coffee
but toffee lip gloss by Anastacio last
lip product I have been loving this
month is a
lipstick and this is by a lip land and
Umrah also notice I'm breezy on social
media she collaborated with them to
create a couple of shade that they she
created three new shades with them and
this is the shade spotlight you guys I
was being honest the first time that
they came out with like their three
shades they were just kind of like
balling up on my lips and not really
working and I already really don't love
liquid lipsticks so like it takes a very
special one for me to really enjoy it
but she says they changed the formula on
these because they were hearing people's
reviews and what they had to say and you
guys this is bomb now I have not worn
the other two but I'm assuming that
they're the same formula this is so nice
like just first of all look at this
shade look at how pretty this shade is
it's such a beautiful pale pinky nude
and I absolutely love the way this wears
I'll wear it by itself I'll put it on
and I'll put a gloss over top of it it
lasts for so long it doesn't dry out my
lips it has like a nice kind of creamy
texture it's easy to remove it doesn't
stick on your lips like cement which for
the entire day it's really really
beautiful it's one of my favorite lip
products right now I love it so
congratulations to AMA for a beautiful
collection that's for sure okay so I
have been loving this face powder like
you have no idea and I'm really shocked
because okay so let me just talk to you
about it so it's by Lancome and first of
all I don't think I've ever used a
Lancome product in my life as far as
like I like tried them like my mom's
products but I've never like gotten
committed to like a Lancome do you see
Lancome or like Lancome or used to work
it on the Mac counter at Nordstrom and
the girls who worked at Lancome called
that Lancome so if you're going to be
like Lancome mmm anyway this is called
the absolute powder I don't even know
how to pronounce this whatsoever
anyways it's the radiant smoothing
powder and you guys this is absolutely
gorgeous so this is in the shade
made absolute golden now here's the
thing that's kind of strange
they have a line of these and they have
like I don't know maybe let's say like
six colors I'm not really sure um but
they have several colors but this is the
only one as far as like my knowledge
that actually hasn't this luminosity in
it so it's not a highlighting powder but
it has like this really beautiful
luminous glow in it now the other
setting powders are like a dewy natural
finish they're really beautiful on the
skin but this is the only one that
actually has a luminosity in it and it
has like a pink undertone in it let me
try to swatch up a generous amount for
you to see it can you see it right here
so it just looks kind of pinky on the
skin when you apply it generously and it
has like a really really very very
finely milled like shimmer in it but it
doesn't look glittery or sparkly it just
has this really beautiful luminosity to
it so the way I have been using this is
I've been using it on my entire face to
set my foundation this past month and I
have been absolutely in love with it now
I will say if I'm really fair and I
don't have a spray tan whatsoever which
right now I'm at like a medium color
where I'm not my fairest but I got a
spray tan like a week ago
um when I did use this today and it was
fine but if I'm very fair I can't use
this product because it will make my
face look too pink if you have pink
undertones it'll work for you no matter
what like my sister could probably use
this because even though she's fair she
has very pink undertones
um but you have to have some color on
your skin is what I'm saying or have
pink undertones if you're really fair
and your yellow undertone then this
product wouldn't work for you but I want
them to come out with this at all
different shades because it is so
gorgeous especially if you're dry and
you're looking for a powder it's just
going to give you luminosity like I
don't know if you can really see on
camera but like my skin like just has a
glow to it but it's not a shimmer or a
sparkle I'm absolutely in love with it
I've been using the Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation recently and I've been
setting it with this and I cannot even
begin to tell you how many people have
been asking me what foundation I'm
wearing and what I'm using for my skin
recently and I'm like oh my god it's
this josie maran foundation and this
Lancome powder that i'm using like these
two are like a match made in heaven I
can't I've never had this many
compliments on my foundation and my skin
in my life like everywhere I go I'm like
oh my god I'm telling everybody I'm like
literally writing it down for people I'm
like Lancome
absolute powder josie maran like it's
viewed its beautiful i absolutely love
it like i'm writer guy for this right
now and i have been applying that with
this new brush by Morpheus so morphe
basically is they discontinued their
entire elite collection which almost
like what because their elite collection
is so beautiful like it's my favorite
collection they have but they're
bringing it back like bigger and better
and they redesign their brushes and
they're improving everything and they
sent out on the new line to everyone
this month like everyone on the PR list
and i have been using this brush which
is the new morphe e for one and i have
been using this to apply this all over
my face and i'm absolutely in love with
it this is my favorite all of our face
powder brush that i've ever used
you guys know i kind of jump around to
everything I'm like oh I'm just using
this brush today you're the nut brush
I've never been committed to like a face
powder brush but this has my heart and
these are launching on the 15th I think
right I've looked at already four start
filming yes they're launching on the
15th for those of you who are interested
in the new elite collection speaking of
the brushes I don't know why like when I
got the brushes in the mail the first
thing I did was go to like the big ones
for some reason but this one okay so you
know how I'm always talking about the
tongue for bronzer brush I'm always like
it's so good but like it's so
ridiculously expensive but I've never
found a brush to replace it like ever
like it just stands on its own it's so
frustrating it's like a hundred and
twenty dollars or something for a brush
but it's so nice well this is the first
brush I've ever actually used that has
taken the place of my Tom floor brush so
I got these in the mail at two weeks ago
and I have not used the tongue for brush
since this has been the only one I'm
using and this is the e too and I
absolutely love it for bronzer I love
the size of it now this of course if
your contouring not going to work but
just bronzing I love the size of it to
bronze my face it's so easy these are so
soft like at first I felt them off these
are so soft that they're not going to
work because sometimes brushes can be
too soft and not apply powder the way
you want them to and I was kind of like
oh these are gonna be too soft I don't
know if I'm gonna like these well I was
completely wrong they're the perfect
amount of softness and they apply powder
Beauty photo Beauty bug I talked about
this lotion probably like two years ago
I used to be obsessed with this and I'm
another one by lush but this is called
sympathy for the skin and I absolutely
love you want to know how much I love it
so much I love it it's dung I personally
and like a body moisturizer obsess like
I'll obsessed like body butters lotions
moisturizer I'm obsessed with
moisturizing I have not taken a shower
without moisturizing my body afterwards
probably since I was like 12
like I moisturize every single time I
get out of the shower if I don't I will
feel like my skin just feels so
disgusting and like alligator skin like
is gonna peel off um and I have
absolutely been loving this I went to
this entire tub and like two and a half
weeks I mean John used it too it smells
so good it's like a neutral set it's not
too strong it's not nauseating it smells
kind of like almond butter in a way it's
just so moisturizing and it's not too
moisturizing where it's like sticky or
like yucky on your skin it's really
really beautiful and of course it's lush
so it's mom
like it's good for your skin it's
handmade it's amazing I'm pretty sure
you guys knew that I was going to talk
about these right these are the cover FX
custom enhancer drops is out there
called yes every single time I'm like
boy what am I going good I have three
shades right here um I own celestial
which is the lightest most like tinman
metallic one that I have moonlight which
is like the middle guy that's like a
really beautiful kind of champagne color
and then the last one is sunlight which
is the more bronze your color I love
these so much so I haven't using these
every single day that I do my makeup and
the way I use them I mix them in with
the Josie Maran vibrancy foundation and
then I set my face with the Lancome
powder um I just absolutely love it I
was nervous at first when I mixed it in
there was going to be too glittery
because these are like legit I'm gonna
swatch the middle one for you this is
the shade of sunlight literally the
tiniest dot you've ever seen and look at
how intense like it looks like metal it
looks like liquid metal so I was kind of
nervous like okay when I mix it in with
my foundation am I going to look like
the Tin Man like rough to see you The
Wizard The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
actually it looks beautiful it's radiant
it's glowing but it's not too much
whatsoever and I make I do like one drop
into my foundation and I will just
decide which one I want to do depending
on like where my skin tone is asin's I
do spray tan so if I'm fair I will mix
in the lightest one celestial and if I'm
more medium I will do moonlight which
I think is my overall favorite one did I
say sunlight earlier okay moonlight is
the middle one and it's like my overall
favorite one because I feel like it's
just the prettiest it's right in the
middle it's not too dark it's not too
pale this is the one I use the majority
of the time and then the darker one
which is sunlight is like a really
really beautiful golden color that I
will use if I just got a spray tan and
this one ah they're all so pretty though
so cool you find products that are so
different you know like everyone's doing
the highlighting game right now like
everybody so for cover FX just to come
and like drop a bomb on the highlighting
game and just bring something so new and
inventive it's just like so sexual I
love it sexual okay so now I have a
morphe abhilasha palette I was talking
about this on snapchat because I saw
that they posted it on their Instagram
and I was like oh my heart I can't take
it this is the nine and and you guys
know if you've been around here on my
channel that their original blush
palette which one I got what's even
called to the 9b I think might beat in
that I don't know but I was like is
obsessed with that like I hit pan on one
of the colors completely and I got
another one and I start like I've been
obsessed so when I saw that this was
coming out I was so excited and this one
is all like peachy pinky corals fully
colors I haven't used are these two
right here because they're darker and
they're more like fall shades but I've
used every other color multiple times
I'm wearing this color mixed with this
one these two right here today on my
cheeks I just absolutely love it that I
swear to god you guys like they're just
so pigmented and creamy like just not
even a generous swatch just like a
normal swatch look at how beautiful that
blush color is and this one right here
is shimmery and I was kind of nervous to
try this one just because I don't know
when you're using like in expensive
brands sometimes shimmery colors can be
kind of chalky you're kind of chunky no
absolutely beautiful like they're all so
gorgeous and I got to say recently I've
seen a lot of comments for people like
talking bad about morphe saying things
like oh you only talk about morphe
because they're paying you I want to say
that that's not true I know that tons of
you watching right now know that I'm not
a sellout but I was going to say it for
like the newcomers and for those of you
all the way in the back
I don't talk about things I don't
genuinely love from the bottom of my
heart I'm you can ask anybody that has
ever emailed me and been like hey will
you talk about this for money and I'm
like no like I do not talk about things
for money whatsoever
i've been talking about morphe since
before they ever knew me they found out
about me because I was writing about
their products they reached out to me
and said hey do you want a discount code
do an affiliation I said heck yes your
products or mom I don't talk about
things unless I genuinely like them
that's just the way it works morphe i
think they are great products for what
they are like for the price that they're
giving it to you
i love it I'm gonna stand by it that's
that I had to throw that out there
because I I can't stand it when my
integrity is being questioned you know
so when I tell you that a morphe prophet
is amazing I'm like putting my name on
it I'm saying this is amazing if you buy
it I'm 99.9% sure you're gonna like it I
don't talk about things for money next
another expansive item this is the Tama
voor de Soleil belong shimmering body
oil and I use this in my I think it's
called bronzed and glowing makeup
tutorial I never remember what my stuff
is called um I absolutely love this and
the one the main reason I love so much
is because the smell oh it's so look I
never thought in a million years I would
like these scents and I feel like it's
the official sign that I'm maturing I'm
growing up and becoming a woman because
my mom used to wear sets like this and
my grandma my grandma used to wear
scents like this look I'm a grandma I
was younger I would always be egg oh
that's no sound brows you snuck it on
Lady and I always wore Soph the smelt
like a bubble gum and candy and like and
now I'm liking these scents you know
it's a very sexy date night set and John
loves it when I wear it you guys wanna
see what it looks like in action you can
see my on bronze and glowing tutorial
it's like two videos back and I use this
all over like my entire decollete
shoulder area and it is just it's so
pretty
so with all like the tank tops that I've
been wearing and summer and all like the
off the shoulder and the cold shoulder
tops I've been using this and I just
love it it smells good
it stayed on like the scent stays on you
since you're spraying it all over your
body
it's
it just gives this beautiful shimmery
glow to your skin it's just like two and
one it's absolutely gorgeous I've been
loving it so I fell in love with a new
makeup remover which I am like so
excited about I don't know why this has
been like the thing I've been most
excited to talk about in this video for
some reason because I love discovering
new makeup removers because I am so
stinkin picky like I need my makeup
remover to the bomb I don't want to
leave an oily residue and it cannot burn
my eyes look that's just standard it is
the makeup remover called a bio derma it
says it is sensible h2o makeup removing
solution for sensitive skin cleanses and
soothe non rinse paraben free and
hypoallergenic it's bomb let me tell you
a little story about this they actually
set me like a PR package with Bioderma
maybe a year and a half ago or so and I
was super excited trikes like I said I'm
always excited trying to make up
removers but it somehow got put into my
donation pile and it got donated and I
was like wait where that where that box
go with the Bioderma that I wanted to
try and my mom was like oh that got
taken to the shelter and I was like oh
okay so I mean whatever I went to a good
place
but still I never got to try it when
they sent it to me so I needed a makeup
remover when I was in LA and I was
hanging out mani a man you was tiny how
Bioderma is so bomb I was like okay I'm
gonna buy it so I got on beauty leash
calm and I bought the big one and I
bought like a little mini bottle just in
case like I loved it and I wanted a
little mini one umm and I'm in love with
this and I love that I had this thing
where you learn adjust pump pump pump
and it comes out so I have it sitting on
my makeup vanity and I just walk up a
lick and just like take is amazing I
wish right now that I was like ready to
take off my makeup come show you it
takes off makeup so well let me show you
the back man so I just literally like
pump like this dodge Aplin um and then
look like you can just take it right off
the back of your hand sorry I even show
you what I'm doing like it literally
just takes everything off so easily
don't I got one HSN I'm like that was a
liquid is this amazing
for $19.99 I will say has a weird taste
like when I take off like my lipstick
has a weird taste but I don't care I
don't care if it tastes a little strange
because it's not like I'm gonna be
drinking this stuff or anything but I
just love it and what I've been using it
with I can't believe that I even want to
talk about this right now oh my god this
is like the most shameful moment of my
entire life okay so I like to refer to
this as boozy cotton because that's
exactly what it is these are facial
cotton pads by the brand shisei dough
and another story that goes along with
this I used to work at on the Mac
counter at Nordstrom when I worked for
Mac I worked at many different locations
and then my very last location was the
Nordstrom counter I'm an International
Plaza in Tampa and when I worked there I
used to see people come in and buy the
copy's cotton pads and girls I work with
would buy it then I would always like
laugh at it a big girl that's because
you haven't tried them and I'm like oh
really like you got to go buy your
bougie con you can't just go to CVS and
Walgreens and get like normal cotton
rounds and we would always laugh about
and they'd be like you've talked about
it because you haven't tried it and I'm
like I never will the day that I spend
the extra money on cotton pads like
that's the day that I'm gonna be like so
my sister had these and I was like
really
you fallin into this whole like it's
just a no cotton pad and she's like
Jacqueline and unique shiny so I tried
them and I was like sold they are
honestly so nice they're these squares
that look like this they're very thick
they don't fall apart or like get
stringy like some cotton rounds can they
just feel so nice and soft and luxurious
on your face and they're square so
they're like you have more to work with
I just love them honestly it is worth
every penny if you ask me I absolutely
love them and that's what I use with the
biodome I use both sides of it
and I just love it I do it's like hard
to explain those things words like I
can't tell you guys how good it is
you suck try them for yourself and then
you'll be like okay yep she was right is
mom a new face product skincare partner
she said I have been oh my god obsessed
with is by Sanitas for those of you who
are asking I did mention it one of my
recent videos I'm still using the exact
same skincare routine that I made like
the video however long ago was eight
months ago maybe I'm sluicing the exact
exact same routine a new products I
think by then I'm not totally sure but
this is the lemon cream scrub and isn't
foliate er and it takes a lot to express
he's a lot to impress me not express me
with an exfoliator some very picky with
exfoliator because I do have sensitive
skin but I'm dry skin at the same time
so I need something that's going to
exfoliate and get all the dead skin off
without being too rough so I need
something that's not Miele but not too
rough because it can't make me sensitive
but it's got it rid of the dead skin so
my skin is very picky and this is
absolutely amazing it smells literally
like a lemon pound cake
is lemon cream scrub but it's not too
creamy it's got tons of beads in it you
can really feel it exfoliating because
I've used like cream scrubs before and
they're too creamy mic this isn't doing
anything this is not insulating my face
this is just creamy with a couple of
little beads in it this one actually
exfoliates its balm it's been my go-to
exfoliator for the month and I have been
loving it okay so last product I have is
a perfume which I am so happy about
because it's the little things in life
I've been trying to find a new fragrance
for months because I just feel like
everything I've used I've used for so
long I was looking for something new and
fresh and I'm definitely someone that
like ah they always say this scent is
like the biggest thing to hold on to a
memory so I've talked about how like
Marc Jacobs Daisy I try not to wear it
very often because it's what I wore on
my wedding day and every time I smell it
it still takes me back to my wedding day
it makes me think of like me and John
wearing leather jackets on cold nights
like I don't know it takes me back and
so I like to I like to hold memories
with scents and I feel like I've been
using the same fragrances for so long
now that I'm like I'm ready for
something new I'm ready for a new scent
a new time of life so anyways I finally
found one I'm absolutely in love with
and fragrance is such a personal thing
um this is by vulgar vulgari I think
that's how you pronounce I have such a
hard time pronouncing this brand oh you
guys are I'm talking about I'll put it
down below whatever um but my phone is
not working right now I'm trying to get
on to the Nordstrom and Sephora app try
and find exactly what this is called but
I'll link it down below I believe it's
called the crystal so fresh it just
smells so like oh my god it's so bomb
it's not floral II but it's not vanilla
