can finally use my pepper spray because
it's gonna be good I mean don't get me
wrong I've definitely been attempted
before like when I'm in line try and get
a piece of pizza and there's a good
drunk girl in front of me like oh my god
I'm just uh I'm like I have pepper spray
pepper spray so let's just get started I
mean I try to make this snappy so that I
don't or anybody and that I mean hello
who's ever bored Wow I'm going to start
off with my skincare products and then
move into my beauty products I do have a
lot of Mac products this month which I
mean that's not all Mac I definitely
have like a variety that's a lie I don't
have all Mac know that I'm looking at it
no it's like just as much math as other
stuff so let's just start so my number
one thing that oh my god is my
Clarisonic it's the Mia 2 and I am
absolutely obsessed with it like I don't
have anything bad to say about this
thing other than the fact that it did
kind of break me out but that's good
that's okay because it was just purging
my skin and bringing everything to the
surface but I'm obsessed with this it's
got like a little can you hear it oh
it's so amazing it's got two speeds and
one is just for deeper exfoliation it's
just it's awesome I love it so much it's
just a tool to clean your skin with if
you guys like a full review on it or
anything or you want me to demonstrate
how I use it I would be more than happy
to do that for you because this thing
has seriously changed my skin's life I
can't believe how clean it gets my skin
it doesn't irritate my skin it's just
it's amazing I have been using it with
my purity face wash which is again
another favorite this month because I
can't live without it and it is like a
true testimony as to how much my skin
needs this face wash I ran out of it I
use the whole bottle and I didn't have
it for three days three nights' three
days only three and in those three days
my skin got so dry so irritated so
Raschi like I was getting bumps all over
the place I was getting like dry patches
and I was using like an old face wash
that I used to use by dr. gross and what
an awful name I went out one night and I
picked up another bottle of the space
wash and within 24 hours my skin was
back to normal
I love it oh my gosh first skincare is
my Mario Badescu cucumber cleanse
loschen this is a brand-new bottle so
it's only been used a couple of times
but I love this stuff so much it is for
combination oily skin and I am dry so I
only use it in night time but I like
using something that is for combination
oily skin because all my other products
are extremely rich and moisturizing and
so I do want to use something I feel
like just really deep cleans and just
like gets me squeaky clean and then I
can go in with like my richer more lush
products but I just love this stuff this
is my second bottle now that I've gone
through it lasts forever I love it i
when I put it on my face just feels so
clean and it's just like oh I when I
don't use it I'll get like little tiny
bumps I've found that what I'm using
right now my skin is like literally
addicted to it and when I stop using it
my skin goes through withdrawals my last
skincare product yes last week hair
products is the Josie Maran 100% argan
oil I cannot bring myself to buy like
the bigger bottle it's $40 I don't know
why I continuously buy this little baby
bottle I'm obsessed with it
this can be used for anything on your
body your cuticles your hair dry skin
anywhere I cream because it's 100%
organic argan oil it's just it's amazing
it's straight oil and I use this every
single night along with my really thick
night cream and I just I love it I rub
it all over my neck and it's just it's
so awesome even on days off when I'm not
working I will use it as just my daytime
moisturizer because my skin just loves
it so much so awesome awesome product
next on my list is actually accessory
pieces I know I did that last time but
like this necklace that I'm wearing
right here it's a sideways cross I have
like a little baby sideways cross that
I've had for years and years I would say
like three or four years it's like a
little tiny one um but this except this
necklace hello get it together
sideways cross necklace and then like
these bracelets right here like this
skull bracelet that I'm wearing right
here it's really cute it has like um you
pull CF semi breaks it's on you came in
sooner I'm talking about I'm sorry I'm
like a bracelet junkie but it has like
these little strings and you pull it
tight to tighten it and then this skull
bracelet right here I and he has like
hearts for eyes I
not tweeted come on posted a picture on
Instagram of these and then the love
bracelet right here
it's like blingy these were all I got
them on dazzle Meow's calm I believe and
I am like obsessed with this company you
guys like seriously
they have like sets of arm candy for
like 25 30 35 dollars like full sets and
then they have like individual bracelets
like all their individual bracelets like
not one bracelet is more than ten
dollars they're so cheap and I just
think it's awesome because like these
Alex and Auntie bracelets that I'm
wearing right here that like everybody
is obsessed with right now they're like
25 to 35 dollars a piece and it's like
I'm so happy that I found a website that
I can just go crazy on and buy like a
full set of bracelets and not spend more
than 25 30 bucks like it's awesome so
I'll put that link down below cuz I
think it's really cool um number one not
number one but like first I'm gonna
mention is the new Mac press pigments
they're so awesome they're literally
press glitter I own six colors but I'll
just show you like what they look like I
use the brown one this one right here
deeply dashing in my brown glittery eye
makeup tutorial I don't know where it's
called it's like glittery smokey eye I
don't know but they're just straight
there straight glitter my favorite one
that I own is spotlit and then my other
one is blonde streak but the blonde
streak I don't have in front of me I
love spotlit because it's got like a
coppery tone to it but you can see like
how it's just like straight glitter if
you get it wet it looks more I don't
know how to put it it looks more just
shiny but if you use it dry it's it's
straight glitter there is the silver one
that one is angelic and they come in all
different ranges of colors like there's
a black one Silver's Browns oranges
blues purples Pink's there's amazing I
put I want to put them on everything
everyday and when I'm like running out
the door really quickly and I'm doing
like a ten minute makeup look I'll take
it with the tip of my finger and just
rub it on my eye cuz you don't get as
much fall out like that and put on
mascara and I'm like ah okay so next is
this mascara that I've been using
I'm obsessed it's the Maybelline illegal
length it has fiber extensions in it I
have been using this from my bottom lash
line mostly my lashes down low are
pretty long if you guys have seen any of
my tutorials you've seen that they're
pretty long
it doesn't chunk up it really separates
and it puts like the perfect coats on
your lashes you can see how long the
individual bristles are and they're
separated already when I put it on it's
just like just I'm done like it's just
so easy I love it cuz a lot of mascaras
will clump up my bottom lashes and make
them like stick together and I'm like oh
I want them to be separated and like
doing their thing not having like a
chunky party so what do I want to say
next next well I'll do my blushes first
of all I have rediscovered this one
right here it is Mac Melba this is one
of my blush palettes make my pinky rosy
ones it is like a perfect pink rose
peach shade it's like a it's a mixture
of all the worlds and it's a matte which
I love because you can add your
highlight on top of it it's absolutely
gorgeous I just love it it looks good
with all different eye colors it looks
go with all different skin tones and it
looks good with all different eyes
shadow looks because it's kind of hard
when you do like a certain type of eye
on someone where you're like okay now
what blush do I put with this like this
blush just goes with everything it's
it's beautiful okay if you guys watch my
channel frequently you will know what
I'm gonna say next because I have talked
about this so much the last month but it
is alpine bronze from Mac it came out
and a praised Sheik can you see how
gorgeous that is like the glimmer in it
I'm wearing it right now on my cheeks
umm make you some kind of money in this
light that's okay
but it is so pretty
it's a mineralized blush it is limited
edition which really drives me crazy
because it is my favorite blush that
I've ever used
in my entire life hands down it knocks
any blush out of the park it's such a
perfect bronze shade it's
orange it's not red it's just like a
bronzy shimmery shade it is gorgeous I
know that my location is sold out of it
I know that nordstrom.com was sold out
of it but you can try MAC Cosmetics calm
you can try Dillard's you can try Macy's
you can try your local counters a lot of
people will ship them to you worse comes
to worse you can try Amazon I'm just I'm
obsessed with this blush it is my
favorite blush I've ever used in my life
I can guarantee you that I'm gonna use
up this entire thing like I'm I'm
obsessed and that blush over top of
Melba I got even better okay so next is
the foundation I mentioned this last
month I'm gonna mention again it's the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi oh my gosh I'm
in shape w5 I just love this stuff it
reminds me a lot of Laura Mercier
moisture supreme foundation the
consistency and the color they're both
very similar I've been going back and
forth between these two and sometimes I
mix them together they both have like a
watery consistency they're not thick
they're not really creamy they're not
jelly they're not moosie like they both
have like when you squirt them out it's
like a true like squirt like it's not
it's not like I'm like he doesn't belong
out it's not chunky like they're just
amazing you know I don't know what
either of them market these as I would
say they're both to a shared a medium
coverage but they're both buildable like
if you're breaking out or apneic you
could definitely build these but I just
love them I have been applying them with
my Beauty Blender which is my next this
is my dirty Beauty Blender and now it
has glitter all over it
awesome if you don't know anything about
the Beauty blenders which I'm sure you
do if you are here on YouTube it all oh
you just get them wet I like hold it
underneath of my faucet and I just like
squeeze like five or six times and then
it gets bigger and bigger and I just
like wrap it in a paper towel and
squeeze out the excess water so that
it's damp and actually wet and I just go
with my foundation and I apply it all
over my face and then I use the tip for
my concealer and I love it it makes it
look so natural it sheers it out it
makes it impossible to apply too much or
make yourself look cakey because of the
moisture in it it really opens up the
pores and let's grab on your foundation
you guys are gonna hate me because I'm
going to tell you about a freaking
amazing product that
expensive it is from a Chanel and I am
NOT oh hi camera and I am NOT a Chanel
person like when it comes to spending
money on makeup I'm not I don't know
like these Saint Laurent Chanel Dior
dolce gabbana
Armani they just never like called me
you know what I love it I think they're
amazing I love the packaging great
products but I just feel like especially
at my age it's not something that I need
to spend money on I thought Hannah
should be spending money on and I can
find things exactly like you for a
cheaper price
except this it is a cream bronzer I
don't know how to say that first word
call me a moron I don't care so low tan
de Chanel so well I don't know I could
just ask the girls that work there and I
don't but it isn't the most amazing
bronzer ever it's like super creamy but
thin but when you apply it like it's not
orange it's not red that's what I'm
saying about everything it's not orange
it's not red it's just gorgeous
oh my god I could not get enough of it
it is it dries to a powdery finish so
like even though it's creamy when it
dries it doesn't look creamy the reason
I love it so much is a because of the
color B because of the blending I've
been using it to blend with my Sigma f80
to brush which is an angled
little fat kabuki brush and I've been
using that to apply after my foundation
and it just goes in like butter like
it's easier to apply them powder it's
just like oh my god there it is and it's
blending out gorgeous and it's perfect
and it has no shimmer and it's just it's
amazing I love it he benefit hoola
bronzer I was really hesitant to try
this because I kept going into Sephora
I'm looking at it and it looks really
really light but I kept seeing these
girls wearing it who are the same shape
Foundation as me and Mac and maybe even
like a little bit darker than me and I
was like that that's lo why does it look
so light in the pan well it's not light
to my surprise it's perfect it's like
it's it's perfect it's like I don't even
know how to explain it but I'm gonna I'm
gonna try it okay this is like the
tiniest little swatch but that's it
right there
umm I don't know how to explain this
color because it's not
like a true brown but it's not orange
and it's not pink and honestly in the
pan my god was on me there was a bug on
me oh my god in the pan it almost looks
muddy it looks like it's not gonna go on
really well but it does it's gorgeous
and I've been using this Sedona lace
brush it's the 367 I had a lot of people
asking me about what this was in my last
video it's a big pink brush and I just
love it cuz I just like put this thing
in there and I just go to town on my
face and I don't you really use this
color to contour I just use it to add
some dimension and bronze um okay my
last two products are lip products and
this first one you guys are probably
gonna be like really why are you showing
us that dingy thing but this is max
cream cup and this is what happens when
you leave your lipstick in the Florida
heat in the car to get destroyed and
it's still usable so that's that it's
right there it is just like a true baby
pink there's no purple tones in it it's
not white it's just a true paint and
then last but not least is max pro long
wear lip gloss and forever rose I know
that I've mentioned this before I'm
obsessed with the prolong your lip
glosses they have the exact same little
stick that looks like a penis from I
think it's Revlon that makes these as
well yeah but the pro longwear
consistency is just amazing it really
does last a long time it stays on your
lips forever and it stays moisturizing
it doesn't dry you out and I just love
this rose color it's not like really
bright or overpowering and again not too
pink not to Beach not too rose right in
between I feel like that's what I've
been saying this entire video it's like
everything's perfect it's not too pink
it's not okay we're done so anyways
those were all of my favorites for the
month of January these are all things I
have had since December because I did
not do a lot of shopping in January
actually I did no shopping in January
because hello it's January I am still
paying my dues to December so I hope you
enjoy and I will talk to you later bye
