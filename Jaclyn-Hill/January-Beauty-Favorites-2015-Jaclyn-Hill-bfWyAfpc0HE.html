January of favorites which is so
exciting because it's the first
favorites video 2015 and I loved filming
favorites videos and I loved even more
so uploading favorites videos because I
love love love hearing what your
favorites are I love interacting with
you guys on favorites videos they're
just one of my favorite videos I am so
happy to be back here on camera as I
told you guys in my last video the past
couple of weeks have to spend absolute
madness but in the best way possible I
mean it's been business and pleasure but
it just been like so exhausting but yes
so worth it I've been running on pure
adrenaline like I've had bags underneath
my eyes so intensely for the past couple
of weeks but it's been such a blessing
I had a patrick Star mani makeup artist
here from YouTube I'm sure you guys have
heard of both of them um both come down
from California along with Jenn from
Gerard cosmetics Marlena from makeup
geek and linda from morphe brushes and
then my good friend nina and my mom we
were all together for the past couple of
days hanging out in florida they came
from California to hang out with me and
spent a few days with me which was so
amazing and it was so exhausting because
it's such a big group of people and we
all have very vivacious personality so
we're always screaming over one another
pretty much like family right like
that's at least how my family is so it's
like the normal but when they left I was
like I can't speak meaty my voice so it
was so much fun it was a great time and
then I just had a lot going on business
so it's been very fun and productive but
it's time to get back to work it was so
funny the very last night before they
had to go to the airport they had to
leave at 6 a.m. so we were trying to
like keep our eyes peeled open and spend
the last couple of hours with each other
we didn't want to go to sleep and I was
like is anybody else kind of excited to
get back home and get back to filming
and they were like yes totally
so even though it was so much fun it's
always good to get back from a life and
get back into the swing of things you
know I'm saying so thought I would just
update you on my life for the past
couple of days Clint Ovid mi a I have a
very long list of videos I'm hoping to
get to in the next two weeks I want to
film as much as I possibly can I'm super
excited about some looks coming up in
some very highly requested videos so
yeah hopefully I month of February will
be short but very sweet so let's jump
into this
so my first favorites of the month I
know that I have mentioned these make
upbeat foil actually I was before but I
have to mention a specific one because
oh my god this shadow I've already made
a dent in it which is a little tense
because I've only had like a little over
a month this is the shade grandstand I
am wearing this all over my lid right
now you can see like that kind of oily
wet looking situation on my lid
that's what this bad boy is right here
it actually took me like a couple of
weeks to try this shadow when I first
got it because it looked like more of a
kind of taupey brown shade but when I
finally actually swatch it and used it
on my lid first of all I look at how
pigmented this is it's like this
gorgeous beautiful bronze more champagne
I thought it was going to come off much
darker and taupey ER and smokier okay
right but this is very beautiful and
subtle in a sense you know what I'm
saying like you can see on my eyes right
now it does not look really smoky or
over the top it's just actually
beautiful I love love love the shade and
I've also been using this one a lot and
this is in the spotlight okay in the
spotlight and I will take this and put
it like right in the center of the lid
sometimes for an extra pump so this one
is much lighter in shade this is more of
like a peachy shimmery champagne but
they are both so gorgeous I have just
been in love with them to the point that
I've been using grandstand I'm not
kidding every single day like I've worn
it every day for the past week and a
half it's all I want to use it's my
favorite color at the moment and I know
what summer comes around I'm going to be
even more obsessed with it because it's
just like that perfect eye shadow they
just put all over the lid and go during
the summertime it's just beautiful let
me zoom you in so you can see what this
looks like up close on my eyes so you
can get a better feel for the way it
looks on I'm gonna go look at that color
isn't that so beautiful I think it's
absolutely gorgeous it's like a bronzy
color but yes so wearable and it still
has like that champagne beautiful glow I
just I absolutely love it so sticking
with eyeshadow as I have talked about
these next and these are such a cool
just like brand new inventive concept
that I think is so awesome so these are
the melt cosmetics stackable eyeshadows
so they look like this they're magnetic
you can stack them together
and they just chill like that which i
think is so like awesome for traveling
these are mighty expensive when I got
online to purchase them I was like low
but you know that still didn't got me
hello addiction is real so my favorite
is unseen so this is called unseen the
dark matter stack so what you get is
first you have a mirror and your first
eyeshadow so this is a black eyeshadow
then you have like this really beautiful
transition color it's like a nice very
warmish creamy color then you have the
reason I bought the staff in the first
place which is the most beautiful deep
cranberry red shade oh and then last but
not least you have this really great
warm brown so you can take them apart
you can stack them together and whatever
order you want it's just a really really
cool concept of the mirror right there
that just closes it off so I really like
these this is the step enigma and this
one same thing with the mirror on the
front and then you have like this
gorgeous kind of cool blueish grey which
when I first got this back I was like
ill and never going to use that that was
like Jacqueline you check yourself
before you wreck yourself you made a
promise that you're gonna wear more cool
toned this year so I did use this and I
actually really liked it the way that
this beautiful purple II kind of
iridescent shade then a peachy shade
like a peachy gold and then again the
other reason why I bought this set as
well this is what I'm all about in life
and I love that because Pantone named
the color of the year as this gorgeous
red I love it like so many companies are
coming out with it and like I'm supposed
to be wearing more cool tones this is
the Kat Von D what is this called shade
light palette I just want to call it her
contour palette but this is the Kat Von
D shade light palette and I'll be honest
I was not planning on purchasing this
and then it showed up in my p.o box
so apparently Sephora sent this to me
and I was not expecting to buy this I
didn't think I needed it I wasn't
planning on it but when it came to my
peel box of course I'm going to use it
um yeah I got obsessed real quick so
they also sent me the brush which I'm so
thankful for because I love this brush
and like I don't I'm not one of those
people to try different brushes from
different companies especially a company
who's not know
Rush's you know like I'm usually using
Sigma or morphe like a company who knows
what's going down with brushes but this
is such a great brush for highlighting
and contouring I love this brush so this
palette first of all I love it because
it's so sturdy and I always love Kat Von
D packaging because it just like so her
and so edgy and my husband has always
like loved kavadi because she's like so
into tattoos this is what it looks like
right here it is so great I was blown
away by what good quality this was like
blown away honestly because I've never
been extremely impressed by Kat Von D
products so this I'm very much am so
you've three contour colors three
highlight colors four highlight you got
like a vanilla shade you have a
beautiful I just love this yellow shade
right here this yellow shade is so
pigmented and just adds so much you're
not going to see that on my pale hand
add so much brightness I am wearing this
yellow shade right now like under my eye
area and that's all I use to set my
concealer today and the UPC will be
great
for someone who is much darker than me
and still wanting like that really
beautiful highlight effect then we have
three contour shades down here I'm using
this middle one which is the lightest
one what I love about these is they are
like a neutral gray but they do not come
off muddy which is so hard to find they
blend out so beautifully like I honestly
have not one bad thing to say about this
everything is so pigmented in here and
just creamy and not overly powdery and
what I love about these is they're not
too pigmented because sometimes when you
try to contour it can be too much and
then hard to blend out these like you
can really pack it and keep going to
really build up the shade you're looking
for so absolutely love is Kat Von D
shade light again I want to call her
contour palette and this brush is just
great I absolutely love this brush right
here just for doing a nice light contour
and I'll take this end and I'll sharpen
out the contour and then set my under
eye concealer love like this right here
good little situation this perfume has
been my love hook for the past two
months I've already gone through quite a
bit of it and honestly I have no idea
what it's called so hold on one second
let me
oh it's like is see see it's like I
think it's like see Miyake or something
like that
hold on is see see oh here we go
it's see me Aki I think Oh la Delisi for
al I cannot do that ok so this is the SE
Miyake I believe ok so this is the Issey
Miyake perfume I saw this everywhere for
the past couple of months like I'm
talking everywhere I go I see this like
I saw and Macy's I saw at Sephora I saw
in Norco I don't know if it's new I
don't know what's happening with it but
I finally just decided to purchase at
about two months ago and this is pretty
much been the only perfume that did
sprang for the past two months what I
love about it is my other favorite
perfume blue table Madonna which is a
misty or booing bouquet these two
complement each other so much and I love
mixing perfumes because sometimes I'll
spray them for the daytime and then when
it gets nighttime and I still need to go
somewhere I'll spray a different one
these two really complement each other
so I'm just saying right in fact but
it's good so this is it see me Auggie I
believe it's the floral one you know all
this it down below everything else I
talk about but if you like something
that smells fresh and floral e but not
too over-the-top it's just so oh it's
just so light and not too much it just
smells so fresh clean girly feminine so
it's so good but the one thing I'll say
is after I had for a couple of weeks the
cap like broke I'm not going to do it
I'm not gonna do it when I like push
down it like goes and sprays out all
over my hands and my hands are covered
in perfume so I'm like wiping that on my
body so I really should get another one
but I'm like I paid good money for this
I want to replace it but it's good I
love it next this is like everything to
me I'm so excited about this product
this is the Smashbox photo finish primer
water I use this in one of my most
recent videos and everyone was like what
is happening you know like wow I
absolutely love this situation so since
its silicone free alcohol-free and oil
free and then on the back it says this
water is infused with electrolytes to
help prime by missing to create our
shears canvas for makeup hydrate skin
for hours and revitalize
complexion to boost radiance so this is
definitely something for those of you
who are looking for a little bit of
hydration maybe your super oily and you
don't want to really over moisturize you
could spray something like this before I
have already gone through this in like
two weeks like that top of the bottle
I've used this every single time I've
done my makeup it has not broken me out
and has not made me sensitive it has not
taught my poor guy has not caused resin
redness which usually everything does
because I'm more sensitive to like
absolutely anything like the other night
mani let me use Hayes like first day
beauty moisturizer and I woke up with
this humongous zip right here on my face
and like first day beauty is so gentle
but like my skin is so ridiculously
sensitive and picky so when something
doesn't cause any reaction I'm like yeah
set the caper so that is the Smashbox
photo-finish priming water I just loved
it - Shh and then go in with your
foundation it's a really great situation
and I personally feel like it makes my
foundation look much more natural much
more healthy and glowy I just think that
it's open it's an amazing idea and like
I hope that more brands kind of pick up
this idea and come out with it cuz I'd
be exciting this is the lipstick in the
shade with which I this is such an old
lipstick is has been around forever I
used to wear this when I was a teenager
when I was like 16 years old and I was
like oh yeah I want those new lips but
this I have like rebelled in love with
the past couple of months in this past
month I've been wearing it constant I'm
going to give you a little swatch so you
can see it right there it is a very very
nude shade with a little bit of a pink
undertone in it I will wear this and
output whatever gloss I want to do
overtop I really love using Mac myth and
then topping it off with a gloss similar
to like my butter cream gloss by draw
cosmetics something just kind of pinky
over top because I think it's a
beautiful nude shade I love this because
it's super pigmented and like I said
before I personally need pigmented
lipsticks when it comes to news I cannot
do a sheer nude because my lip color
naturally is so red that I need a new
that's going to really cover up my
natural lip color so that's why I love
that shade because it's really pigmented
this is a draw a cosmetic lip gloss and
I don't know if I've actually even
talked about this in a favorites video I
might have but I just don't remember
this isn't a shade shimmer of hope and I
have used this all month long it's like
the only gloss I have been using
I have on my lips right now at this
moment it is just like my favorite new
color and ver like I reach for this
I mean it's so pigmented I reach for
this constantly but look at how gorgeous
that shade is like it's just so
beautiful and it's just like a nice
pinky nude with a little bit of peach in
it it's just the best like it's my
favorite nude lip gloss I think of all
time honestly I have to mention it you
know I'm sure I've mentioned it before
just because I've been using it all
month long pretty much every single day
I put this on it's the only one I've had
in my purse all months so that shimmer
of hope I do have discount codes of
course I have some really awesome
discount codes from Gerard cosmetics
right now so if you think about buying
anything I'll put all my codes down
below for you guys is this the last
thing I have oh my god this is the last
thing I have these are lip products from
where DS called these are called the
lippie stix so cute from colour-pop
cosmetics I have been using these a lot
this month and I've had them whoop oh
sorry about that
I've had them for a while but I just
started using in this past month and
I'll show you a few different colors
because I have I have a few of them but
I want to get some more so I got online
solid there's a few colors I don't have
that I really want I am wearing the
shade bound today on my lips with
shimmer of hope gloss over top but I
will say right now these are super
pigmented and what I love about them is
they have tons of gloss in them so they
don't go on Matt they go on with a kind
of glossy effect but they're so
pigmented which is amazing because
they're like glossy pigmented and
moisturizing like yes they're so good I
will say though it took me a minute to
get over the smell they do have a very
peculiar smell I cannot put my finger on
it reminds me something in my childhood
and I don't know what it is but at first
I was like oh my god I don't I can deal
with this and at first I would smell it
on my lips just like it's just different
but after a couple of times I've worn it
I'm completely over it I don't even
notice it now when I apply it but I love
these and they are very inexpensive
which is
so this is a shape easy right here and
this is the shade bound right here they
are just so convicted in this color I
love this is the shade of Cheers
and this is a matte formula this I want
to watch I want you to watch me swatch
this because I love this color so much
look it would a gorgeous berry shade
that is Oh like it's not purple and it's
not red it's like the most beautiful
berry oh my gosh this is just gorgeous
like I'm telling you this color is like
this isn't shade Cheers and it's crazy
cuz I've been looking for a color
similar to this for so long and I was
like I was going to create this color
myself okay it's so gorgeous so cheers
and just like so beautiful so that
completes this favorites video I really
hope that you guys are enjoy and as

worry I will be doing looks with the
Jaclyn hill favorites palette by morphe
very soon I know that you guys have been
asking for asking for I see the comments
it's coming I just kind of wanted to
back it off a little bit because there's
been a lot happening people being kind
of upset they were able to get the
palette the first time around and I
didn't want to put in anyone's face and
upset them anymore so out of
consideration for the thousands of
people that have been wanting to get it
I just kind of wanted to have respect
for those I just kind of wait a little
bit but the palette will be coming back

filming some tutorials and very soon
