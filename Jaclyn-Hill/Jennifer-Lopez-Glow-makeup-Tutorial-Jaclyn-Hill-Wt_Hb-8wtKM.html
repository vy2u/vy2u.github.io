makeup tutorial is going to be on this
picture of Jennifer Lopez it is inspired
by her picture it is not the exact
makeup products I mean I have no idea
what she used on her skin whatsoever I'm
just looking at it and I'm going from
what I see um it is concentrated on the
skin and not the eyes I think that's a
first for me here the eyes are very
neutral as you can see actually I have
absolutely nothing on on the under eye I
don't have mascara eyeshadow nothing I
left it completely blank because that's
what she did so it's different but it's
very fresh as you can see right now it
probably looks like I barely have any
makeup on but there are a lot of steps
in this and I am going to show you the
additional steps of things that
celebrity makeup artists do so that you
have the options um I've never done a
video just on skin before so this is
really exciting for me because I'm very
obsessed with skin and neutral
highlights and natural low lights and
yeah so I'm excited um so yeah I hope
you enjoy and let me know what you think
leave comments below
okay so first thing I'm doing is
moisturizing my skin sorry that's my
husband in the background anyways after
I moisturize my skin I'm going to put on
some eye cream I personally do this
every single day before my makeup but
I'm showing these additional steps
because Jennifer Lopez takes amazingly
good care of her skin and it's important
to do these things before we use the
foundations that we're going to go in
with so now I'm just putting on any
concealer you have it does not matter if
you're very oily you have oily eyelids
you're going to want to use a primer but
I'm just using my select cover-up
concealer by Mac and I'm using the exact
same shades I use under my eyes I'm just
dabbing it on both eyes and I'm using
this as a primer I'm doing this because
it gives me more coverage and I want my
whole skin to be flawless now I'm using
vanilla this is an eyeshadow by Mac and
I'm using a big brush I'm going to put
it underneath my eyebrow area and I'm
doing that cuz I want that area up there
to stay light now I'm going in with
Mac's naked pigment this is just a
powder form of an eyeshadow if you've
never used a pigment before and you're
not familiar with it you can take that
same brush or any brush and just dab it
all over my lid area from inner corner
to outer corner and as you can see it is
truly what it's called
it is a naked pigment and you can barely
see it so you can just throw it on all
over the place and it gives you just a
nice shimmery glow now I'm showing you
these two blushes this is peaches and
soft Meowth and then that is quark
eyeshadow I'm just showing you those
because these are going to be what I'm
using on my eyelids right now I'm
putting in Cork in the crease and then
after I put cork in there I'm going to
go in with both peaches and the soft
knee out and I'm going to just dust it
all over my crease now you're probably
thinking why are you using blushes but I
personally like using blushes when it
comes to doing a really neutral eye
because it looks very natural because
they're made for the skin in the cheek
area the formulation is just much more
neutral and kind of like see-through in
a way and that's just how I feel I think
it looks very natural and pretty so that
is why I'm using these blushes now I'm
going to go in with the same gel
eyeliner as always she has a gel
eyeliner on in the photo that I'm basing
this off of with a little wing on the
outer corner now the eyeliner is on the
thin side so I'm not going to make
anything too thick or crazy I'm just
keeping it nice and thin
with just a little bit of point on the
edge um hers is definitely an elevated
cat eye so I'm just doing the same thing
as her I have to be honest this whole
makeup look was definitely different for
me because I'm noir that I'm used to
normally doing like thicker eyeliner you
know with more of like smokey eyes and
something a little bit more dramatic so
this was a little on my comfort zone but
I do want to show you guys it because
it's definitely different than my other
videos and I want you to see different
options anyway so I just threw on some
Demi wispy and now I'm highlighting
under my brow while I'm waiting for the
other lash glue to dry and these are
really neutral eye lashes I use these as
opposed to my red cherries because
they're shorter and more natural-looking
and hers are definitely natural so now I
am going in Mac's skin base this is a
primer for the face and I waited a
little bit for my moisturizer to dry but
now that it's dried and soaked in I'm
going to just rub this all over my face
before I go in with my foundations now
I'm going to give you guys some options
first off this is Mac face and body
foundation it's very popular with a
celebrity makeup artists it's basically
all water with a sheer tint and it's
very moisturizing so it's going to give
you a really dewy finish now this is Mac
Studio sculpt and Studio moisture tint
Studio sculpt is a gel foundation it's
going to be a medium coverage and the
studio moisture tint is just a sheer
tint now this is Laura Mercier
moisturizing supreme foundation it's a
medium coverage
gorgeous gorgeous finish and then next
to it is the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer which again is just going to
be a nice tint with a little glow you
can add mac's fix+ or charge water to
any foundation and it's going to sheer
it out and make it dewy
I personally am using mineralized
skinfinish for this look it's a sheer
foundation but it has a satin finish so
it gives you a really pretty glow but
it's buildable so if you feel like you
have things to cover you can go ahead
and put some concealer on it and then
build on top of it but I'm just going to
do a sheer coverage for this because I
want to do what JLo does and JLo is very
into minerals she basically uses all
minerals including on her eyes and she's
really into like healthy skin and taking
really good care of herself
not so much but I have this mineral
foundation and I am a really big fan of
it so that's what I'm using I'm putting
a sheer coverage all over my face
blended down on the neckline and you
know you guys know what's going on here
I don't need to explain myself for this
but yeah it looks really yellow on here
I don't know why and I also look really
pale which is completely unnecessary
because I've actually been in the Sun a
lot lately and I've gotten like three
shades darker and my foundation so kind
of hurts my feelings anyways this is
select cover-up and I'm going to take
nw20 and NW 25 and mix them together and
then I'm going to put them under my eye
in this triangle upside down triangle
the shape whatever and I'm going to take
it up towards my temples and then once I
have it on there I'm just blending out
at the bottom with my brush and then
once I tap that out I am going to go
with my finger and I'm going to blend
out with that because I think that your
finger is the prettiest way to blend out
your concealer even when I'm working on
clients I wish I could get my fingers on
them but I can't for sanitary reasons
because your finger can blend like no
brush or sponge ever can it's amazing
and even though I'm doing it the wrong
way
use your fingers from the outer corner
and tap in it'll help prevent from
creasing so that's just a little tip for
you and if you can see I like took my
concealer brush and I go up on the side
of my eye by my eyebrow that also helps
the highlighting process so if you take
your brush and you tap up in there in
your inner corner that will naturally
once again give you really pretty glow
around the eyes now I'm going to take
this prep and prime highlighter and it
is in the shade radiant rose this is
like a twist up pen it's really fun so
you get to like draw all over your face
so I'm just going to put this in outer
corner of my eye and slant it upward and
that angle you can see what I'm doing
and then I'm just using that same brush
or you can use your fingers it doesn't
matter and I'm just going to sweep it
down just to give that natural highlight
now once again I'm using products like
this as opposed to shimmery highlights
because it's not going to make that much
of a noticeable difference but it's
going to give you a really natural glow
so as opposed to being like wow that
smoky eye is hot it's going to be like
your skin is really pretty or you have
great cheekbones this is just really
going to emphasize the natural
highlights and lowlights of your face
make you look sculpted now I'm just
using a shot of music how many buddy I'm
sorry um but I'm just gonna take a
mascara and just buy my natural lashes
to my false ones and as you can see I'm
not going all the way up on my fake
lashes I'm just staying at the bottom
because I don't want to coat it on the
false lashes otherwise they will look
really fake and cheap so now I'm taking
mineralize skinfinish and this is in the
shade light I'm using this synthetic
paddle brush so it's fake hair and I'm
using that because the fake hair is
going to put more of this on my skin and
help press it in so I'm pressing in this
light powder and all the areas I just
put on my concealer as you can see I'm
trying to mainly press and not swipe
because with this brush you want to
press press press and push those
minerals into your skin and not just
swipe it across your face otherwise it's
not really going to go into your skin
it's just going to lay flat on your
cheeks and that's not going to be so
cute now just taking any highlighter you
have and I'm dabbing it in that inner
corner really precisely just to give a
nice glow in that inner corner right
there now I'm going to take some OA silk
because I was looking and I was like
this isn't enough JLo having more of a
warm glow and I'm just dusting that in
my outer corners just really quickly
nothing fabulous and just dab dab dab
just to make it a little bit warmer
because I wasn't satisfied now I'm going
to take Mac's
strobe liquid this is such a cool
product
it's a lotion like a moisturizer for
your face I take it on a brush and I put
it on top of my foundation now you
cannot do this with the strobe cream you
can only do it with the strobe liquid
there are two different products and
they look the exact same by Mac
basically but one can go on top of
foundation and one can't I'm using this
because it's not sparkly and it's not
glittery and because the lotion it soaks
in and it makes your highlight look so
natural these are just more tricks the
celebrities use to get that natural glow
as opposed to like glittery highlights
like soft and gentle albatross now I'm
going to take matte bronze I want to use
a matte bronzer on purpose because she
doesn't have any shimmer oh and there I
am hey okay I thought that was really
funny I'm sorry
a little notches okay and now I'm going
to take that bronzer and I'm going to
just emphasize my cheekbones by going in
that motion swiping it back and forth
back and forth right underneath of my
cheekbones and then after that I'm going
to bring it up on the temples of my face
and at the top of my forehead on both
sides I'm not going to go too much on
the center of the forehead because she
doesn't have that much bronze in that
area she has it very sculpted on the
sides of her face so just staying in
that area and concentrating mainly there
don't bring it down too far you want to
leave the forehead light now I'm going
in with something special cream blush
cream blushes are amazing and I'm just
gonna take this little brush and just
dab dab dab and I'm just gonna Pat it on
my cheeks and I dab and then I rub and
then I dab and then I rub and I dab and
I rub I don't like to go in and
immediately just swipe it because it is
a cream so it is easy to put a little
bit too much but Mac has this
formulation they redid their cream
blushes about a year and a half ago and
they are amazing they last all day you
don't have to set them with a powder
they stay so well and they give such a
like a natural glow not like greasy glow
like some do it's like a natural glow
okay
I'm going back with that same vanilla
shade as before and I'm going to put
this on the top of my lip on my Cupid's
bow and then I'm going to take that same
blush that dark one and I'm going to put
it under my lips this is going to help
emphasize my lips and J Lo's makeup
artist does this to her and now I'm just
going on clear brow gel and setting my
brows I didn't do my eyebrows according
to hers but hers look really thick and
fluffy so I'm in love and that's the
look that I normally go for in the first
place okay
I'm digging in my bag and I found Nick's
mega shine lip gloss in la la I'm going
to give my lips a coat of this and then
when I'm done with that I'm going to go
in with Revlon's soft nude and I'm
putting that on top I like the way it
looks better when I do the gloss first
and then this otherwise I get too much
nude and she didn't have a super new
mouth I'm going to mix that together my
perfect look after that you're done so
have a good day girls and thanks so much
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
