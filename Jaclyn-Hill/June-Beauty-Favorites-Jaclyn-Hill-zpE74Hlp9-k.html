my June favorites I can't believe that
we are a leaving June I'm just shocked
by that the fact that we're entering
July already is crazy to me
July and August are always the busiest
months for me and my family because just
so much goes on so many birthdays so
many anniversaries I just cannot believe
the were entering July already and my
birthday is coming up in just a couple
of weeks it's just I don't know where
time is going nowadays it's crazy I just
want to say before jumping into my
favorites and I just seem kind of like
foggy I just haven't been feeling the
best these couple of days I don't know
what's going on but my throat is just
sore and my nose is kind of stuffed up
and my head has been pounding so I'm not
like sick but I have like my sickness is
like teasing me I'm like a touch of a
cold but it's not enough to like keep me
down so anyways I'm just doing a little
foggy and not really clear right now so
if I'm kind of like that's why if you
liked this video should be called my
favorite lip products for the month of
June because seriously half of the
things I'm about to talk about our lip
products so I'm going to start with
those to get out of the way to move on
to everything else so the first two lip
products we're going to talk about are
new from buxom and they are called the
true nude lip foundation I have the
shade buff and the shade nude they came
out with like probably 5 or 6 different
colors from light to dark so that all
different skin tones can find the
perfect nude for them and I like that it
says true nude lip foundation because I
was so intrigued by it and it really
when it goes on completely mutes out the
color of your lip almost like it what if
you're putting a foundation or concealer
over your lip these products are also
great for putting it on and then
applying a lip gloss or even a lipstick
over top if you just want to completely
wipe out the color of your lips and
start with a fresh blank base and not
have your natural lip color interfere
with the shade that you want to apply if
that makes sense so I'll show you what
they look like so this right here is
buff this is the lightest one and then
this right here is nude so you can see
that buff is super light and a little
bit of a pinky undertone and then nude
is a little bit more on the brown side I
can wear them both if I want a shade
darker though it would start to look
Brown on me
no longer new so these right here are
the two palest one so if you're around
my skintone one of these would be a
gorgeous new I have been wearing these
all month especially the lightest one
the buck one I pretty much put it on
every single day under whatever lip
gloss or lipstick I'm going to wear next
I have a bite Beauty product and this is
the high pigment pencil in the shade
Madeira I believe we pronounce it I
absolutely love bite Beauty I've talked
about by Beauty I think in like the past
three favorites videos probably but
they're actually I think my number one
company for lip products in general I
just actually love them this color right
here is such a gorgeous nude and this
would be a beautiful color on almost
everyone it is so creamy the best thing
about this is it almost feels like a lip
crayon with the lip gloss mixed together
it is so gorgeous but it's not so creamy
to the point that it bleeds because
sometimes you can just get a lip color
that's so intensely creamy and pigmented
it'll just kind of like run down your
lips this stays in place is such a
gorgeous neutral has a little bit of
paint peach and a little bit of pink so
it's just beautiful I have been wearing
this non-stop for the past three weeks I
have another bite beauty product and I
was not expecting to love this as much
as I have and what is this called this
is the lip liner in the shade nutmeg so
this is a really interesting lip liner
it is angled so different than a typical
lip liner it has an actual angle to it
it's not just a flat pencil that you can
sharpen so at first I was kind of like
okay this is interesting once you get
used to it it really is nice because it
has that angle so you can really carve
out the lip as long as you just keep
turning it around and it makes it really
easy to sculpt out that Cupid's bow area
with that little angle in it so I
actually have quickly learned to love
the angle in this at first I was like
this is kind of weird but I love it now
so you can see right here I really pack
that on by the way it doesn't have to be
that bold but I just like on my hand you
can see right there it is a really nice
neutral color I will say for the Kylie
Jenner lip craze right now this is a
beautiful lip liner along with Mac world
but this has more pigment than Mac world
and I personally think it's easier to
apply so if you wear this all by itself
it's like a perfect replica
Jenner lip that people are just going
prank right over right now I have
another lip product I seriously feel
like this is the month of like pinks and
neutrals like packing have so many
neutral lip products for you guys but
seriously like these have been my babies
all month long I've been so excited to
talk oh there's a go okay I've been so
excited to talk about all these lip
products to you guys because I have just
been loving them okay anyways I have
never tried this company before for lip
products at his BH Cosmetics and it is
the cream Lux lipstick in a shade
forever nude I actually discovered this
because of my niece who is just turned
eight years old because they came over
this last weekend and I was babysitting
them and I had just gotten some BH
Cosmetics stuff in the mail so I opened
up the box and we're all looking at it
and we're all playing with the makeup
together and then my niece I turn around
she was wearing this new lipstick and I
was like Talia what lipstick is that
where'd you get that from and she was
like oh is this one right here and I've
been wearing it for the past three days
straight now so this is called forever
nude I don't actually have to swatch
this because I am wearing it on my lips
right now so you can see what it looks
like I do have a lip gloss over top of
it but I just wanted to share this with
you guys because it is a gorgeous nude
it is so creamy I'm shocked by how
creamy and pigmented it is and it is an
amazing price so I'll link it down below
so you guys can find these cosmetics I
don't know where all they're sold
because like I said I'm not a BH
Cosmetics expert this is my first time
trying them but I will find exactly
where they're sold and I'll link it down
below my description bar now for the lip
gloss I'm wearing over forever nude
lipstick it is buttercream and this is
by Gerard cosmetics I did create this
lip gloss myself I did quickly mention
it in the end of my no makeup makeup
tutorial and for the amazing feedback
that I've gotten from you guys thank you
so so much for all the pictures and the
tweets and the comments just I
appreciate it so much you guys are
loving this applause as much as I am so
I have to say this is my number one
favorite this month um yeah I'm a little
biased because I created this color but
I just think it's absolutely beautiful
even if I didn't create this it would
definitely be my monthly favorites it is
just such a beautiful baby pink you can
see I'm wearing
here my hands and I also have on my lips
over top of the forever noon so you can
see how it can look very different
depending on one lipstick you have
underneath of it if you wear a nude
under it it can really look more neutral
and wear a pink under it it'll
definitely make it look more of the baby
pink so it's gorgeous it's gonna
honest-to-god line going on pretty much
everybody
I was so picky about it just being
perfect and I think it's perfect I just
absolutely love it so again thank you
for you guys for all your support it's
just it's been awesome
also I typically do a 25% off discount
code for anything like drug cosmetics
lip glosses and all that but for the
next seven days we're going to have a
limited 30% off discount code site-wide
so anything you want to try lip gloss
lip gloss bundles BB cream whatever it
may be you can use a 30% off discount
code for the next 7 days only I'll link
in my description bar down below and
butter cream is sold individually and
it's also sold in bundles and one of the
bundles is my favorite you can pick out
the lip glosses that it comes with for a
discounted price plus you can use a 30%
discount code so you guys get what I
mean and if you don't I will link
everything in the description bar down
below to make it much more organized
because God knows I'm not organized
today I have to talk about the nudie or
fluid sticks because they're so amazing
this is a product is yes it's expensive
it's Dior the packaging like look how
beautiful that packaging is it is so
pretty I love it it just looks so
glamorous and feels so glamorous okay
anyways moving on this is such a
gorgeous lip color not only is the color
amazing the actual formula is ridiculous
this is the shade kiss me I believe yes
three eight nine kiss me and the way it
applies it's called a fluid lipstick and
it's just very difficult to UM describe
to you because it goes on feeling like a
watery consistency of a thin gloss and
then all of a sudden it starts to feel
like kind of tacky on your lips but not
in a sticky way in a good way
not like a matte lip gloss way in a good
way and it doesn't say it's long wearing
I don't think but on me it's long
it has this tackiness where almost feels
like glue on my lips and this color
doesn't leave for hours so these in
general the fluid lipsticks by dior are
absolute beautiful I of course got the
pinky neutral one and the shake kissed
me because I'm a pinky neutral kind of
girl I have another OCC lip product to
talk about
I have literally mentioned OCC lip tars
anything for the past three or maybe
even four favorites straight but this is
a lip tar stained gloss when I put when
I pick this up and saw like once it's in
the shade men her mean her men her men
are men I have no idea what this shade
is called I will put it in my
description bar down below but it's so
cool because it's a lip gloss so
typically these tars are a very like
long wearing they kind of suck to your
lips and there's amazing but this is a
gloss and you're navigable you'll see it
because it's literally so nude sorry to
scare you I'm so up in your grill it's
so new that you literally came and see
it but it is not clear it is nude so let
me try to fix my camera settings maybe
you can see it now like you can't even
see it
anyways it is not clear it is a nude but
I love it because any lip color that you
put on the trim like oh this is a little
too pink or oh this is a little too
Brown or whatever it may be you can take
this gloss and just rub it over that lip
color and it just going to tone it down
a bit and mute it out a little bit and
just make it nice and shiny and these I
cannot get enough of OCC lip tars these
smell is just so pepperminty and so
amazing they're one of my favorite lip
products ever so OCC lip tar and men her
meaner I don't know again I'll listen
town below I just picked it up with my
toes with alright we're done with the
lip products next so NARS came out with
a new eyeshadow formula and let me just
say off the bat they are so amazing no
one is going to get these eyeshadows and
not like them I can't see how they are
just so absolutely okay I'm back it was
mr. ups with
a little baggage so anyways nerds came
out with these new eyeshadows they are
called the dual intensity eye shadow I
think they came out with ten different
shades I have my two favorites though
and they are both a bronzy taupe shade
because I just love bronzy topes all
year round but especially in the
summertime so this one right here is
Himalaya and this one is do me I don't
know how to pronounce it di o and E but
they are both absolutely gorgeous the
Oni is more of a pewter e more silver
where Himalaya is most a beautiful topi
bronze they are so gorgeous they're very
similar in shape but so different so
that is literally just one swatch like
on the back of my hand this one right
here is Hema Leia and this one right
here is de so I don't know the camera is
picking it up at Himalaya is more of a
bronze where gionee is more of a warm
silver they are just so gorgeous this is
an eyeshadow you can just put on the lid
blend it out with any Brown and it's
just going to be amazing they're so
beautiful they look so high-fashion they
almost look like you have like liquid
silver on your eyelids they're just
gorgeous they're very different than
anything I've seen before except they do
slightly remind me of here we go it
reminds me of math extra dimension eye
shadow which were limited edition this
isn't a shade sweet heat I remember I
wore this eyeshadow in a video in
January and I have never had so many of
you guys ask me what I shadow is wearing
on my lid and just the way the color
payoff comes in the extra dimension
eyeshadows it reminds me a lot of the
new NARS eyeshadows so go NARS for
coming out these and making them
permanent they are fabulous this is
totally random but let's talk about
deodorant I'd mentioned this before but
we're coming into the summer months so I
want to mention again this still has the
plastic on it because I had to order a
bunch of them in the mail because my
local Sephora does not sell them anymore
but it is the healthy deodorant and I
get it in the scent fresh vanilla lemon
it is literally I'm not gonna say
deodorant snob well I am this is
literally the only deodorant that I will
ever use because I personally cannot
stand the smell deodorant I think I've
tried every single one of them and I
just think it's disgusting you get out
of the shower you put on your lotion you
spray your perfume and then you probably
deal with it smells like baby powder and
it's
oh it kills my vibe so this just smells
so heavenly it smells so fresh it smells
like a perfume that I want to wear so it
is the healthy deodorant and fresh
vanilla lemon it may not work for you
but it works for me I love it or
vindicate all nighter makeup setting
spray I am a huge kind of the chill
makeup setting spray I have for over a
year but now the all-nighter I'm not
going to say it's taking its place I
will say this one makes my makeup last
longer than the chill one does the chill
one I feel like really more than
anything refreshes me and makes my
makeup look a little bit more natural if
it looks a little powdery or just a
little cakey or I've just been outside
and it's just not looking so good the
chill one I feel like really blends it
together and makes it look very useful
and dewy and so I know that oily people
might not be a huge fan of the urban
decay gel makeup setting spray but since
I am more on the dry normal side I love
it the all-nighter does not make me look
dewy it literally just prolongs my
makeup so for someone who maybe
combination oily this would be a great
setting spray because it really does
make a difference for me my mom she
loves it as well too and obviously she's
much more mature and she says that it
reacts great with her skin she loves it
and she feels like it literally doubles
the wear of her makeup as well so so I
give you my momma's opinion too I need a
breath I think I'm gonna look next we
have Maybelline pumped up colossal
volume express mascara I did show this
in my Ulta haul and I have been
absolutely loving it the wand looks like
this is just amazing it lengthens and
volumizes my lashes a few times this
month I have done my makeup and not worn
any false lashes I've just curled and
done two coats of this and I have been
so so satisfied with it I have to say it
is my favorite mascara right now
including high end so it is the
Maybelline pumped up colossal but I have
not tried the Miss Magne Magne Magne
whatever I just got it haven't tried it
yet I know that that's very popular as
well so if you watch my channel then you
guys are probably waiting for this
product to come on because let's get
real it is the new glam glow power mud
dual cleanse treatment masque ha
my father glam globe could do no more
they come out with this bad boy it is
such a great mask
honestly like I was content I didn't
need this in my life because I had the
hydrating mask I had mud mask I was good
this one it's it's amazing like they
truly brought something else out that
it's just as great as the other masks
I'm just so impressed by glam glow
I love glam glow my skin loves glam glow
I just I love this mask so what this is
is it goes on like a mud and after you
leave it on for 10 minutes and you wash
it off it turns into an oil it is made
to pull out makeup and dirt from your
pores and seriously this works
it feels so refreshing so cleansing and
if you guys really want to know a lot
about it just type it out on Google and
look it up because honestly I could make
an entire video on a glam glow mask
there's so much to talk about I'm not
going to talk about it for the next 10
minutes but it is a great mask your skin
really does feel and see a difference
and this might sound weird but to me it
almost does the same thing that a
Clarisonic would do I know it sounds
strange but it feels like it's just
going in deep and truly cleansing my
skin um there's been a couple nights
I've used this what I haven't used my
Clarisonic and after I'm done with my
whole skincare routine my skin still
feels the same and looks better from the
nights that I do use my Clarisonic which
sounds strange but it really does the
clean I just absolutely love this I do
have a discount code for glam glow which
is very exciting because literally I get
tweeted tweet it tweet Twitter somebody
tweets me literally every single day
telling me that they want to try a glam
glow mask but they don't want to spend
the money and I get asked literally
every day if I have a discount code a
promo code if I have heard one or two
let you guys know if I see any codes
coming around so I am very excited for
those of you who are always asking about
discount codes and glam glow so that you
guys can finally get a chance to try so
I will put the discount code down below
in my description bar along with links
and if it doesn't apply to anything I
will also give you guys a heads up
everything will be my description bars
always and very detailed down there for
those of you who don't know I lay it all
out very simple I just have to quickly
mention I did do an entire video about
makeup geek blushes I'll list it down
below if you guys want to see it but
I just have to say these are all monthly
favorite in general but I will say the
one I've used more than anything wait
what am i doing why was i grabbing
infatuation is spelled out right here it
is a warm pink I do have it on my cheeks
right now along with what I'm going to
talk about next and this is just my
absolute favorite in the palette I think
for summertime it is so boardís it's
not coral it's not peach it's not hot
pink it's not baby pink and it's just a
beautiful mid-tone warm pink it is so
gorgeous I love this it pretty much goes
with every single makeup look that I
wear so this is spellbound by makeup
geek last but not least ah this is a
Bobby Brown shimmer brick I literally
have a sick obsession can we say
obsession with the Bobby Brown shimmer
bricks and obsession clad throw out
there if you're new to my channel bitch
has an obsession with shimmer Brooks
this is the shimmer brick in the shade
beige I got this at the very very end of
last month so I could not talk about on
my monthly favorites last month because
I think I bought it the day before I
uploaded my video and then Amanda and
saying if you don't know who she is here
on YouTube go check her out she's
adorable a man that NSYNC talked about
this in her favorite so I text her and I
was like is it that amazing and she was
like yes you're gonna be obsessed and
Amanda you were right this is amazing
this is half this is one of my favorite
highlighter it is the only highlighter
along with the Becca opal I have used
all month along I have it on my cheeks
right now it is just let me see if I can
show this to you up close because I I'm
really getting into this you guys need
to see this it's really not like a
yellow base highlight or a silver base
highlight it's just so neutral and
perfect it has every component in there
has the bras it has the white gold it
has a little bit of like a cool tone
silvery gold it's just on the cheeks it
is ridiculously beautiful I've literally
been wearing it all month long alright

strong fear this videos gonna be 2530
