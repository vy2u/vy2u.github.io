today's video I'm going to be doing a
review slash swatches demo and kind of a
first impression s on the new Kylie
cosmetics and Kim a Kardashian West's
collection hey my the only one that
still does culture Kim Kardashian like
just saying ah a second ago Kim
Kardashian west it sounds so weird to me
because the first time I've ever
actually called for that I still just
call her the old Kim gay first house
where it's a damn Manor is some respect
at some point in life is that referring
to were asking crashing West because
that is your last name now where iPhones
collection I pretty much died aside I
was so excited because Kim Kardashian is
so iconic when it comes to makeup I mean
when I worked at Mac several years back
I'm not joking when I see that every
single client and customer came in there
with a photo of Kim Kardashian either in
their purse or on their phone because
she was such an inspiration we actually
had a Kim Kardashian lookbook at the max
counter and we would open up her clients
with like 10 different Kim Kardashian
looks because she was so popular and
just so bangin at that moment as far as
her makeup and just doing things like
people really had it seemed dumb before
and her and her makeup artist have just
teamed up to do so many incredible
things and just brought make it to a
different level and I truly and very
inspired by everything Kim Kardashian
and Mario and Joyce have all done
together because I just think that she
has really done a lot a lot for the
makeup industry say what you will about
Kim
I know they're a very controversial
family I understand I don't agree with
already maybe one life but that doesn't
matter of talking about makeup today
circular say that I did receive this
collection from Kylie cosmetics which is
why I have it several days before it's
actually launched I am on the PR list as
where they thank you so much to Kylie
and her team of course for putting me on
that list and to being on that list I
really appreciate it I'm always so
grateful to be receiving free makeup but
that in no way is going to shape or move
my opinion about this question
whatsoever I will be very honest and
very upfront or something I don't like I
will be my opinion to you guys of course
which is my opinion
you guys might feel differently about
certain things where I want to put that
out there it's way more important to me
that you guys like me rather than kind
of you
liking me because the work that will
happen if I say that I know why
something they'll take me off the PR
list because they decide they don't like
me anymore and that's fine that's not
the other world I can continue to
purchase Kylie cosmetics if I'm
interested in something but I'm going to
be upfront with you guys before anything
else the question comes in this box
right here obvious and I'm holding it
it's really six cardboard packaging I
love all of the muted tones of pink is
all matte which is really cool and
different and it also came with this
little butter right here in the pr
package I received and said hey guys I
hope you love the cake aw Kylie collab
I'm so excited to try my four phase
mousse have a surprise coming soon xoxo
can kardashian-west so of course the
world like what the prize so the reason
I was so ridiculously excited when I
fell question is because it is four
different shades of nude lip colors
which is just like are you joking me
like I can't even begin to tell you how
much that excited me it's right here the
exact or if they came in when I received
the package and it starts off with the
shade Kimberly Kim keke and Kimmy I
present to like Kim is very know for her
nude lip which is what makes me love her
makeup so much all the time and she
really got to express herself in this
collection to come out with all four
different shades of nude and that is
probably why she ting them all different
nicknames for herself I am wearing can
really on my list right now the only two
that I actually tried on is Kimberly and
Kiki so I'm looking at the names and
what cheating right now but I do not
have these things memorizing so along
with dropping for brand new shades they
also launched these in a brand new
formula as well which I was really
excited about we've I've never heard of
a cream liquid lipstick or a creme
liquid suspicious depending on who's you
want to be with your wording I was
really excited to try this now I have to
say for some reason my mind saw okay
cream liquid lip it's going to be a
creamy yet long wearing lipstick right
like that's what my mind immediately
thought because I still had just been
kind of taught like liquid lipsticks are
dry they're very long wear and they're
very matte you know at all those with
abscissa they're out there you know like
Kathy Jeffrey's our Morphy and I thought
be alike they all are the same types of
feeling and we're not these so don't buy
you thinking they're going to be like a
liquid lipstick and they actually are
more like a lipstick that are liquid and
creamy does that make sense they are not
going to be masked they're not going to
be long wearing I mean they are kind of
matte but not matte like an actual like
long lasting liquid lips are a very
creamy and it will come with a whip
souffle feeling they're definitely one
sheer size the texture actually reminds
me of a whipped cream cheese if you ever
had whipped cream cheese but still
Adelphia cream cheese if you put on a
bagel that's actually kind of how I got
a bagel sounds so good right now
let me shrink about this got this you do
not even big ol I'm on a diet right now
hey people I never thought it literally
remind me I like that whipped cream
cheese it's a little bit creamier so
they are not at all going to be what we
have seen before in the past as far as a
liquid lipstick goes they are a
completely and new formula I put that
out there for you guys right now because
you're expecting like I was expecting to
receive a matte liquid lipsticks creamy
but not you're going to get and if that
is what you're expecting you're going to
hate this collection so just be aware
that that is not what it is and then we
can move forward to swatches so there it
is on for you if you can see they
actually look like on the lips themself
and not just swatch on the back of the
hand I know I prefer that when I'm
watching a video and this is Kimberly
which is the one that I'm actually
currently wearing but I've had it on now
for about 45 minutes so I'm going to go
over top of it you can see what it
actually looks like after 45 minutes
wear which is right now and then this is
what it looks like when you apply it
brand new and it's fresh
so this is a shade once it is freshly
applied which is absolutely beautiful
and I cannot say enough good things
about this color it's just like my
perfect nude I love it so much as you
guys did see it does wear off because
like I better at four I applied this I
had a tight about 45 minutes before so
you can see the difference in the color
and definitely did say it was it
completely gone but it did say it in
that 45 minute period which is fine
because nowhere on the box does it claim
to be a long ring looks sick whatsoever
bonds between an out there for you guys
in case you're hoping these are long
wearing they're definitely not and then
when it comes time to remove them this
is just a totally clean paper towel or
something on it
they have come right off just like a
regular lipstick would it's not
difficult whatsoever okay so next I'm
going to go with the shade kin which is
do more peachy one oh my god I know I
said the first one with my favorite but
that my if you guys I had a try on the
second one yet this is gorgeous it is
such a perfect shade of peachy nude like
I love that it's not coral I love it
it's not orange I love it's not like a
brown hair car like it is that perfect
peachy nude this is just gorgeous okay
next we have the shade Kiki
what the hell this is the perfect shade
of baby
nudey pink this is perfect like this is
a wearable nudie feels like I'm weird
about like really pink undertones
because isolate a lot of times he'll be
like a purpley lilac undertone and nudes
this is just like a true baby pink
undertone it's very wearable very
flattering this is a gorgeous shape okay
last but not least we have the shade
Kimmy
so this color for some reason before we
feed it I just saw online I thought it
was going to be way more Brown it is not
brown whatsoever it is like a almost
curly rosy peachy neutral it is so
pretty this collection is just like the
shades in here are ridiculously gorgeous
alright so after my overall opinion on
this collection I would say the first
thing that comes to my own hands down is
that the shades in this collection are
absolute perfection if I were to give
the shade in this collection a grade it
would be an A+ they are just incredible
and now of course that's going to be a
matter of opinion depending on your skin
tone but for my skin tone I think they
are absolute perfection the factory has
a true news a pinky news a peachy nude
any more rosy nude it just it's perfect
and nothing is going to be unflattering
on any skin tones in here because
there's nothing that's like or you know
we're like super Brown or anything
that's going to watch anybody outlets
are all just beautiful beautiful shades
they did an incredible job on the shade
range for the formula I personally am
NOT the biggest fan of this new creme
liquid lipsticks formula I have to say
the reason why actually is where the
balance is because these shapes are so
good that would prefer them to be in a
gloss because I love but highly blotted
they're one of my favorite walkins ever
actually I even put them in my best of
beauty video for last year because I
think they are one of the most standout
losses I was before these colors to be
in her gloss or to be in matte liquid
lips actually just because this new
cream formula it does lead the lips very
quickly which is the exacting complaint
that I have about these YSL lipsticks
that I love so much like I say I love
them but it's the same issue with you
lipsticks like I love the colors it's
super super creamy super comfortable on
the lips but they stayed so quickly and
that's the exact same complaint if you
will out have about this new formula but
on the other side of that I will say
that this new cream formula for some
reason it doesn't make my lips almost
look more flawless if you will I'm
trying to find the word to you but they
definitely have a more like plush kind
of like
vibe everything which looks very like
smooth over almost like it's been like
Photoshop a little bit for my lips just
look nice and like oh and I do love the
Scheinman to give it's like a nice
amount of shine it's not crazy shiny and
it's also not like a satin matte so I do
love that I just wish that it was more
long-lasting personally but there is no
negative in this formula that's my
opinion I'm saying it's not like it's
like breaking up or cracking off or
running or like super drying or Giron
sanders50 that there's nothing wrong
with it
I would just prefer it was something
that lasted longer because these colors
are so good and whatever they do have in
store for everyone because you
substituted a surprise coming soon I'm
really looking forward to it because I
hope that this is just the beginning I
hope they come out with a couple more
things in this collection that would be
super super exciting because I feel like
I like Kim Kardashian we're spirit
animals when it comes to makeup which I
love all her neutrals I love her Duty
skin I just love everything that she
does with makeup I have to say I
actually meant that old Kim Kardashian
with that intense bold smoky eye and
those new lips and that dewy skin like
gorgeous already guys so that a wrap on
this video I think I hope that I helped
you in some way with this new Kim kW and
Kylie cosmetics collection let me know
if you guys have any comments questions
concerns maybe you're offended by my
highlight you can leave all that in the
comment section and down below I will be
down there talking you guys of course
soon as I upload this video you're one
more thing before I go
I've actually been done filming for
about 15 minutes at this point when I
turn off the camera I thought I wonder
what it would be like if I applied a
regular a long wearing this lipstick and
then this over top because if you know
me I applied glosses over top of my lip
of the fix all the times been love how
it's like a long wearing gloss if you
apply a gloss over top of a long wearing
that list anyways so I just went in I
applied a regular long lasting with look
at synthesis of the Lord liquid miss by
Jeffrey star and I apply the shade
Kimberly overtop of it and I would
wearing for about 10 minutes now and I'm
obsessed it just makes it like a creamy
version of a long wearing with limits
and I love the way the formula looks
it's not settling in my line it's not
cracking it feels nice and creamy but
just to block it until 50 does it feel
so now basically I'm going to have a
creamy long-wearing with with lips by
mixing those two together so I can
promise you that I will definitely be
wearing this collection over top of long
wearing liquid lipsticks because back
before Malaysian that I was prefer so
it's all about playing with makeup and
mixing things together and mixing things
up to decide what it is that you want
out of your cosmetics and I dress up all
the time so yeah I'm very excited about
this now because I love the way it feels
on my lips okay
I've been talking out for real I love
you guys thank you for watching and I'll
see you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
