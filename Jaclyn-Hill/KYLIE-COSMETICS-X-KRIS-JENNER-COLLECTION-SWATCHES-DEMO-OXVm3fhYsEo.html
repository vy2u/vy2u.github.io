entire intro my video looking like this
totally forgot I've actually had
nightmares before that I leave the house
with my bakes so on I know this is like
literally first world makeup problems
but true story I am so excited for
today's video for many reasons number
one I have a brand new filming setup
that I have worked so hard on it and
been building for the past couple of
weeks I have a new camera I have me
lighting I have new backdrops a new
microphone that's hanging above my head
like oh my gosh how's my audio now I'm
gonna be honest this first video we
might have some trials and errors
because this is an entirely new setup so
bear with me but I am so excited and
hopefully you can see the difference in
the quality and I'm really I'm really
excited about this so it's like my dream
setup so hopefully you guys love it
there's anything that you think needs
changes or improvements please let me
know that comments down below so I can
make the quality of the absolute busts
and I feel like this button down here
you can't see it cuz it's not on camera
but there's a button right but crack and
I think any second says good go boom and
burst open I'm gonna make there a little
engorged right now long gorge it's that
time a month and the second reason I am
so excited for today's video is
obviously as you can see by the title I
am reviewing the new Kylie cosmetics and
kris jenner collection today I don't
know what it is you guys I had not been
this excited for a collection in such a
long time
actually I'm like I dunno what it is
it's Kris Jenner I freaking love Kris
Jenner I know there's so many opinions
out there on the internet about Kris
Jenner and how people don't like her for
whatever reasons it may be but you know
what that's someone's mama that you're
talking about so zip it and please don't
say anything nasty about her or the
Kardashians here my channel in the day
it doesn't really matter what we think
about them they still pop and they still
doing their thing and I'm really excited
for this collection I just thought the
way that Kylie like announced it like on
her Instagram live and snapchat was so
cute like I just love Kris I think she's
so funny and I really do think she's
down to earth even though like she's so
over the top and like bad and bougie
like she just seems like a cool like a
cool mom like if I saw her pick curse
it's whenever I watched her show like
religiously and whenever the girls would
be like nasty to her like they would
always kind of like make fun of her like
kinda like poke at her and play games
with her
I mean to her I always believed her like
I would get so defensive for Chris
because I just think this she's I think
she's awesome
anyways thank you so much to Kylie and
her PR team for sending me this of
course it's always a blessing and always
exciting and I actually woke up and saw
Kylie's Instagram and I was like oh my
gosh she's collaborated with Chris like
I was so excited I was talking with her
on the phone I was like Kylie cosmetics
clapping with Christian heiress is so
cool like how dope is that like to
collaborate with your mom like that's
just freakin awesome you know and then I
walk downstairs dingdong and the package
showed up and I was like it was just one
of those surreal moments rolls like Who
am I I'm gonna stop rambling and get
into what the video is actually about so
we have the PR package right here I
think the marketing behind this is so
cute like Chris
Excel Kylie's name she did like the
whole sorry my phone is on she's like
the whole Kylie cosmetics hack on
Instagram and then her signature right
here and you guys when I open this up I
got a little horny a little bit because
I am obsessed beyond obsessed with
black-and-white anything so this
collection the collection I would
purchase just solely for the packaging
because I think it is so cute and so on
brand and I just I give this packaging a
10 out of 10 and a blue spruce so this
collection includes
a lip liner a matching lipstick a lip
collection which is eight different
shades and they are mini bottles and I
believe it includes mattes Velvets and
glosses then we have a highlighting
palette right here and then an eyeshadow
palette up here I want to start off by
swatching the highlighter palette
because this is the thing that I'm most
excited for the packaging is so cute
so the actual palette itself says you're
doing amazing sweetie I was so excited
when I saw this because if you guys
don't watch the show Kris Jenner had a
moment where Kim Kardashian was posing
basically nude and she was standing
behind the camera with her cell phone
taking pictures like squatted down and
she's like you're doing amazing sweetie
and it just went viral it turns this
meme and it's it's something that me and
my friends say to each other all the
time now so I absolutely love that it
says this and it's also in black glitter
that says that on the palette as well
and then when you open it up oh okay so
I thought it was an all highlighter
palette I was wrong so we have two
highlights up here a shimmery blush or
this could be a highlight on some skin
tones but more like a shimmery blush and
then a map
oh I'm very very excited about this
blush right here it's a really beautiful
color so let me go ahead and so watch
these for you guys I'm gonna do it on my
arm on my very very pale arm okay I
would talk about it so there you can see
all four swatches we have three shimmers
and one that I will say the highlighters
they feel like the same consistency as
her typical highlight formula not her
wet set formula which is very very
different formulations I'm gonna use to
make it like to wipe that off to my arm
by the way you guys these Neutrogena or
do these called the night call me makeup
remover cleansing towelettes best makeup
wipes I've ever used in my entire life
like that's all it takes
gone so as far as the actual eyeshadow
colors in this palette obviously this is
just my opinion because there's no such
thing is like an ugly eyeshadow palette
everyone has their own range of shades
that they want for their skin tone and
their everyday and their nighttime look
but for me personally this is not my
type of palette ease or not my colors so
this is not something that I would
purchase for myself I don't know I'm not
trying to say I don't like it there's
something about that I'm not obsessed
with alright first shade is I love
myself which is a matte vanilla it's
like a bisque second shade is gorgeous
it's not super frosty it's more like a
satin third shade is it's an emergency
fourth is very nice swatch is a little
patchy fifth shade is haters whoo that
one is not coming off nice that
definitely is gonna need like some fix+
or glycerin to make that stick to the
lid next shade is vodka tonic this one
ooh that feels really smooth that's like
butter
next is payback's a bitch whoa it's got
some nice pigment for a matte impressed
okay the next one is called impressed
I'm gonna go on top cause I'm running
out of room the next shade is 10%
that's pigmented as hell I'm watching
you
next is talent yes Kris Jenner and then
last but not least does it come in black
that's a pretty decent Blackie
my main concern is that there's 12
shadows and there's only four mats and
one of them is a black so we have three
neutral mats and honestly we have like a
bisque and then we have a black and then
we have two mats in between and that's
it so I have 12 colors when I saw this I
was like this is a lot of shimmer and a
lot of frost and I definitely prefer a
palette that has like ten mattes and
like four shimmers you know I'm saying
like the opposite that's kind of like my
hesitation but we're still gonna try it
out and see if I can come up with a look
that I enjoy and again this makeup I'm
telling you that's just one wipe and
look how much I took off okay so now
let's swatch the lip liner and there we
go the lipstick and then the actual
lipstick packaging has middle metallic
fingers all over it Kris Jenner
definitely doesn't give a that's
for sure about what people think or say
about her okay so here we have the
lipstick oh my god you guys see that or
do that again and I'm like barely
touching it let me do it again and like
really try to barely give any pressure
wow you guys I am Michael literally just
like barely dragging it like a look at
that that's very impressive I'm probably
gonna love that and then for the actual
lip pencil whoops mine came like smush
eed on the top let's see yes
vetti creamy and it's the exact same
color which is awesome how it's so true
to shake sometimes people will say it's
matching and it's really not that's
awesome okay and then last but not least
the adorable lip collection
momager so cute okay so first shade is a
velvet and it's called that's wild
which Kylie's Velvets are one of the
most beautiful lip formulas they're so
comfortable they feel very cushiony on
the lip next we have the shade boss
which is a repeat that Kylie actually
already has in her collection maybe it
was a limited edition I'm actually not
quite sure I didn't keep up with that
but the shade boss is beautiful I've
worn it several times and that is a
matte liquid lipstick the next one is
the shade middle finger which is this
beautiful hot Orange and this is a
velvet shade so again just like the
first one same formula next we have the
shade over whelmed which is again a
velvet and ooh that color is really
different it's like a Mavi burgundy and
it's nice and deep we have the shade too
which is another velvet that's a nice oh
my gosh my mom would love that
take a nice rosy pinky shade we have the
shade this is everything and this is a
gloss very peachy next is driving me
crazy which is another gloss that's more
my speed it's definitely a baby pink and
these are really sheer I don't know if
it's because um like their minis like
maybe the wand is skinnier but typically
Kylie's gloss to have way more pigment
than this this is the last and final
color it is a gloss in the shade really
actually it's like really with a
question mark and this is beautiful I
love that nude okay so now that we have
swatch everything on the arm now I'm
going to try everything on my face which
is the true tests okay I'm gonna start
off with the shade I love myself and I'm
just gonna tap a brush in there and go
over my entire lid area basically just
to flatten everything out and create a
nice base for the eye shadow look so now
I'm gonna go in with the shade it's an
emergency right here which is the Mac
cool tone brown but i'ms going to dust
that in the upper crease of the eye you
guys have no idea how much it pains me
to go in with cool tone Browns other
than cheaters and liars go Browns let me
show you guys what my palette looks like
after applying that you can see all the
kickback right there from that shadow so
it is a lot I will say it's more than I
am typically used to in a palette of the
shades
I'm sorry shadows I use on a day-to-day
basis so just so you're aware that is
how its performing now I'm gonna go in
with the shade payback's a bitch the
names are so cute sorry in focus thank
you no we're gonna take that and put
that right there in the crease and this
is going on very rosy like rosy pinky oh
you guys I'm gonna be honest
these mats I'm not living my best life
can you guys see how this is blending on
my eye I don't if you can see can you
see isn't gonna focus on you close this
is a new camera and it was really
expensive
give me my money's worth okay so if you
can see on camera
I have blended this to the best of my
capability over here and you can see
it's just like kind of patchy and just
Ashley like it's not wanting to live it
the best life on my eyelid and I don't
know why cuz I prepped my eyelid I use
eye cream every day my eyelids aren't
dry right now but you can see that's the
that's the current situation okay so I
have been blending both of those masks
for at least I would say five six
minutes at this point just trying to
make the best of it I'm gonna be honest
they're very dusty they're very ashy
they're not going to stick to my lid and
it has taken a lot of effort to get it
to this place which makes me really sad
I mean not really sad there's actually
sad things happening in the country and
this is not one of them but I am
definitely a little disappointed in the
matte shadows in this palette um let's
move on and try a shimmer though I know
you guys are gonna want to see me use it
dry first before I get it wet okay okay
I'm gonna go in with the shade a vodka
tonic right here which is a really
beautiful like champagne satiny shade
I'm gonna go on with that dry it first
even though I never use shadows dry I'm
gonna do it just for the purpose of this
video you guys are gonna want to see it
so here it is totally dry okay I mean
I'm gonna be honest I hate it I always
do I never liked shadows dry there's
Fela all over my face it doesn't go on
just no I'm not in it no hold on mister
I'm gonna spritz my brush with some fix+
kind of rhymes not really a little bit
and then we're gonna go back mm that's
right now
it is going on beautifully so let's try
the other lid and this time I'm gonna
use my finger to apply it which I've
been doing a lot recently oh yeah that
looks really beautiful it's still not as
pretty as it is with the fix plus stuff
alright so now I'm gonna grab a little
mini blending brush right here I'm gonna
go in with the shade 10% which is this
purpley it has a little bit of a sparkle
in it but overall it is a matte you
might want to refer to as a satin no by
the way oh my God look at how much
product comes up though in it dust
either way I'm used to from Kylie
so I'm gonna just dab that on the outer
corner of the eye okay I don't know
y'all you can see the fallout situation
right now I don't need to explain myself
still gonna try something else I'm gonna
go in with the shade impressed right
here which is sorry we're not in focus
which is a shimmer okay I'm gonna be
honest you guys this palette is a really
big disappointment for me and I think
I'm in a confessional booth and I'm
saying what the I love typically Kylie
cosmetics shadow palettes like the blue
honey palette I love that palette you
guys know if you watch my channel I
basically never talk about about
products if there's a product that I
even have a feeling that I'm not gonna
really love I won't even someone video
on it because I'm like I want to say I
just don't like talking bad about things
that people have worked really hard on
but I'm just saying in general you guys
this is not a product that I would
release myself I would definitely be
like no it needs to go back to the lab
we need to work a little bit harder on
this okay so now I have on lashes liner
on my inner rim and mascara on my lower
lash line so the look looks look looks
the look is a very different now and I
obviously like it much more because
obviously lashes in liner and mascara
makes everything better okay I want to
try out her lipstick and the shade give
me a kiss just because I'm super curious
if I'm going to like the shade or not
I know Kylie's lip liners they're good
they're nice they're creamy I don't want
to waste my time using it because I'm
gonna wipe this right off and then I'm
gonna try one of her lipsticks instead
so let's just go in with this oh that's
good oh yeah mm-hmm
this is balm okay the lipstick formula
is beautiful the color is really pretty
it's not really me my mother would love
this color I'm not saying it's a mature
color I'm just saying that going over
this color I'm like this is my mom my
mom loves these kind of colors I would
love to go in with a red shade right now
from the collection just because I
really love that first shade that's wild
which is a veld it and I know that I
would love it on the lips because I know
Kylie's
and I love her velvet liquid lips I love
her liquid lipstick her mattes I love
her glosses like when it comes to her
lip formula I love them like I argue
with some of my friends cuz a lot of my
friends think that her liquid lips like
her mattes are too dry I disagree I
think they're beautiful as long as your
lips are exfoliated as long as they're
not super dry going into it I love her
liquid lips I love all of her lip
products so I already know that I'm
gonna like this entire liquid lipstick
velvet lipstick and gloss collection
that Kris came out with I'm gonna go in
with a shade too blessed and this is a
velvet does a really really beautiful
color and honestly I am NOT the kind of
girl who likes shades of pink like this
and if I'm gonna wear a pink I want it
to be they're like a really soft nude
baby pink or I want it to be like bright
and neon and obnoxious like a raspberry
I never do like these mid-tone Pink's
but this is a really really beautiful
shade and again this velvet formula is
so beautiful so let me show you what it
looks like when I kiss the back of my
hand after it's been on for maybe like
three minutes I'm gonna sit here and
wait and let it like dry out and it
kissed my hand so you can see okay so
it's been maybe like two minutes and
I'll show you mmm it's there damn and
it's on my teeth that's actually more
than I thought it was gonna be to be
honest hold on let me try again
no like I got first layer off damn okay
wow I didn't think that it came off that
much I really didn't but yeah it
definitely comes off a lot like a normal
lipstick but on the lips it doesn't feel
like that on the lips it feels like it
feels more like a matte lip but just
like super cushiony and just like
moisturizing and good it's still yummy
on the lips
okay so last but not least we are going
to try the pressed powder highlighting
and blush palette amazing I'm gonna go
in with the only matte shade in the
palette which is your sister's going to
jail this is really pretty terracotta
peachy shade which is right up my alley
doesn't really match my makeup look at
all but that's okay this just for the
video
okay hold on I didn't show up so let me
try different brush
I
okay so I literally do not see the blush
like I'm mine and kidding I do not see
at all it might be because you should
see it a little bit on my skintone like
it literally horn like if I like get in
there it's on my brush if I go okay now
I see it a little bit that's a lot of
blush to have to use to get a little bit
more than anything I just kind of drying
out my cheeks it's not really doing
anything okay let's try the highlight
let's go in with the first shade it's
snowing pussywillows and get that on my
brush that I always used to highlight
and put that right there oh that's
beautiful
we got a winner
aisle 7 winner winner chicken dinner I'm
just highlighting everything because now
that I found something that I really
love in the collection I'm like let's go
I'm gonna be honest these highlights are
not as smooth is what I am used to from
Kylee typically her highlighters are
smoother than this so this is a little
bit different for me it's not as smooth
as normal okay you guys so now that we
have tried every single thing in this
entire collection I have to say that my
overall review is not positive which is
the first time this has ever happened to
me on camera so I don't know the kind of
feedback that I'm gonna receive from
this and I actually right now feel like
a little uncomfortable and a little
nervous and insecure about this because
typically even when something isn't a
100% it's still like an 80% for me
you know and like I always find things
about it that I love in this collection
there are things I do love I think the
packaging is incredible which I know
some people do not agree with paying for
packaging paying for packaging sorry I'm
stuttering I personally am someone who I
know the kind of effort and money that
goes into creating packaging and the
design behind it so I appreciate
packaging big time the packaging in the
marketing on this is so cute and I also
love the fact that it is Kylie
this young girl who star this brand is
her mom and her manager and it's coming
out on Mother's Day I think it's a
really cute idea and the packaging is
adorable the lip collection is awesome
and I already know I love Kylie's
Velvets I love her mattes
I love her glosses so the like eight
mini bundle is super cute and I give
that an A+ and then of course the
lipstick the color is really beautiful
not my jam but still in general
beautiful and the formula is gorgeous
the highlighter palette is the thing
that I was so excited for because I
still love the packaging I love the
shades look so beautiful the blush
really really let me down I mean like I
was like scrubbing this and I literally
got zero pay off and asked for the
highlights again I was just disappointed
I love the highlighters like the
individual Kylie cosmetics highlighters
so I was expecting to be like that but
these honestly if you can see on camera
they're just kind of like especially and
I smile like is making my cheeks look
kind of chunky like like very texturized
and it's not like a smooth highlighter
and then the eyeshadow palette I have to
say like overall just the colors in
general are not my color scheme so for
me personally that's me being biased now
if this wasn't all warm red and orange
palette I would probably give it like a
B+
because I've been okay yeah they're ashy
the pigment wasn't freaking bomb but
still like the colors are amazing but
because I don't even like the color
scheme for me personally I would give
this palette a D to be honest oh my god
I still love and respect the hell out of
Kris Jenner she's a boss bitch I just
think that they should have spends a
little bit more time on this collection
maybe and if you enjoy this honest
review please let me know give this
video a thumbs up or leave me a comment
down below obviously I'm not trying to
like spread hate whatsoever that's not
my vibe I do not have time for that
especially what's going on in my life
right now I don't have time for hate and
negativity so that's what I'm kind of
like wait no I wanted this to be
exciting and amazing but it is what it
is that's life so yeah I hope that you
guys did enjoy this video make sure to
