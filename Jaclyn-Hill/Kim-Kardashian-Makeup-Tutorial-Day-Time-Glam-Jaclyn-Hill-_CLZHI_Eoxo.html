and then just a blown-out warm brown
okay seriously t-mobile needs to stop
texting me I don't care at tutorial ah
hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
a Kim Kardashian inspired makeup
tutorial this is the same look that I
was wearing in my may favorites and I
got so many requests from you guys
asking me to make this into a tutorial
for you and then a couple days after
that I was cleaning my house with the
each handle on in the background and
there was the Kardashians was playing
and it was like an old season when I say
old it was like a month and a half ago
honestly I can't keep up there's a new
season every week anyways it was her
makeup was so similar to I had done for
the May favorites and I figured that I
would just kind of put those two videos
in one that way I am fulfilling both
requests that I get all the time so I
really hope you enjoy this look it's
very and right now
with that light color all over the lid
that's very glossy and shimmery and
those blown out warm Browns it's daytime
and nighttime appropriate so I hope you
enjoy it and I will see you guys soon
bye
first I'm going to take the shade Peach
Smoothie this is by makeup geek I
already have my eyes primed and I'm just
going to take this on a big fat fluffy
brush and just buff this into my crease
area I'm doing this in the upper crease
because you always need a transition
shade no matter what tone it is you need
something so that everything is seamless
and there's no harsh lines then I'm
going to take creme Brule again this is
by makeup geek and I'm going to put this
in the lower crease this time and then
once I have it buff down that lower
crease I'll kind of just bring it up and
out along with that Peach Smoothie but
for the most part you want to get this
on that deep low crease on the outer
corner of your eye and then I'm going to
take the bombs mineralize eyeshadow and
work is over rated I love the name of
this and I'm going to tap some into the
cap and then whatever is on that lid I'm
going to take a brush and just rub it in
there to grab the product the brush that
I'm using is by Sigma and this has taken
the place of my Mac 242 brush
I discovered it like two weeks ago and I
just love how much it presses on
pigments it's so dense that I barely get
any fallout which is amazing so I'm
starting on the inner corner of my eye
with the main product and then whatever
I have left over I'm going to buff it
out now this I am putting all over the
lid even up into that crease area where
we have that color as you can see I'm
bringing it all the way up I want that
whole lid to have this color but I want
it to be the brightest in the inner
corner then I'm going to take that
middle shade Coco bear this is such a
beautiful warm dark brown and I'm going
to take any pencil brush I think this
one is from Sedona lace any pencil brush
will do and I'm going to just trace out
my crease this isn't going to be a cut
crease look but I want the main color to
be right there in that area as opposed
to smoking it in throughout the eyelid
and then you can take a brush with a
tiny bit of that Coco bear on it or you
could use the Peach Smoothie or the
creme brulee or you could have the brush
blank it's really not going to make that
big of a difference and I'm going to
just blend that out and I'm going to
lightly bring it down but ever so softly
because I still want this pigment to
shine through all over the lid so just
be really gentle with this then I'm
going to go back with that same brush
from before with no additional product
and just buff over it so that there's
once again no harsh lines then I'm going
to take mac's fix+
and I have a little bit more of this
mineralized eyeshadow on my brush and
I'm going to just give it two sprays you
can see the second time I kind of back
up that way it's not soaking wet and I'm
going to just tap over a second time and
this is going to give it a really shiny
dewy wet look so that it just stands out
even more in the center of the lid I'm
going to use Maybelline eye studio but I
wanted to show you guys this makeup geek
um what's it called eyeliner even though
it's upside down it is amazing I
actually don't remember which one I use
so I'm really sorry it might be the
makeup geek but it is one of the best
eyeliners it is black as coal it is
absolutely amazing and literally it
stays on so intensely that it's hard to
get off then I'm going to use Mac
mineralized foundation and Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation I could
not make up my mind so I just used both
just to get what I wanted I wanted
something nice and dewy and fresh
because as you know I'm dry so I'm just
going to buff this all on the face and I
know it's a lot darker than my skin but
it matches my chest so that's why I
chose this shade then I'm going to use
Mac's prep and prime and radiant rose
which is the pink shade and I'm going to
do a lot of highlighting Kim Kardashian
is known for highlighting we all know
this she over highlights and sanely so
I'm just going to do all the steps you
know right in the center of the forehead
and then bring it down the nose a tiny
bit I personally like to bring it down
the nose a lot because I don't like
bringing a lot of attention to the
center of my face and then I'm going to
take Mac Pro Longwear concealer and nw20
which once again is about two shades
lighter than I am and then I'm going to
take a wet Beauty Blender and just buff
this out I know it's going to look
really really light but these are the
steps that can Kardashian take so I'm
doing the same thing so that you can get
an idea for what her makeup artist does
on her and just make sure that you blend
this all over the place you're not going
to leave too much of the face with just
the foundation for the most part you're
going to blend this all over in the
center of the face to just give that
really highlighted fresh glow to the
center of the face but the outer corners
of your face all around the side by your
hairline you don't want to get any of
the highlight there that needs to remain
the color of your foundation bringing it
down where I'm buffing it out right now
is just going to dramatic drum I can't
speak
it's going to make your contour more
dramatic you can see my little pimple hi
so just buff that all around and then
I'm going to go in with mylar which is a
matte shadow and this is a satin shadow
so it's not frosty but it's not matte
it's beautiful just any clean brush and
I'm just going to buff that in the inner
corner of my eye just to make everything
a little bit more seamless and just to
bring more attention to that eye it's
just more of a highlight and it's not
dramatic and I'm going to take shroom
you know this is my favorite highlight
of all time and I'm going to buff this
underneath of my eyebrow and I'm just
going to make sure that there's no harsh
lines left in this you don't want this
to be super harsh or like a hard white
line so make sure you buff it out and
I'm going to take Mac mineralize
skinfinish in the shade medium plus and
any big brush that you have I have a
real technique brush techniques brush
anyways and you can see the powder
flying all over the place and I'm just
going to buff this all around my t-zone
area because even though I don't get
oily my foundation will break up in this
heat and humidity and then I'm going to
take the same highlighter that I use all
the time it's Mac Pro but you can still
get online even if you do not have a pro
card or a pro member and it's called
emphasize and I'm just going to push
this all over my eye area very lightly
just to set that concealer I'm not
packing it on otherwise it'll be really
really white and then I'm just going to
comb through my brows using any that you
have and I'm using the Anastasia brow
Wiz I'm using shades soft Brown I have
to warn you I had an issue with my brows
while I was doing this one right here my
right brow was not working out I've been
battling them recently and trying to
grow them out so it's been a little bit
of a mess but I always make the outer
tail a lot darker than the inner corners
to make it look more natural and then
I'm going to use the Anastasia brow gel
and this is just clear and this is just
going to make it so that my brows don't
go anywhere
I love this brow gel it's the best one
I've ever used it's amazing and then you
can take any brown now I'm going to go
back with that same color that I use
before my crease the creme brulee and
I'm going to just buff that all under
that area with a pencil brush and then
after that I'm going to go back with
Coco bear and put that under there as
well and then once again you have to go
back with your pencil brush and just
buff buff buff don't be afraid to
color underneath your eye just make sure
that you blend it out and really take
your time because otherwise you're just
going to have a jagged e line and that's
not going to look really pretty and
smoky so then I'm going to go back with
shroom a second time on my inner corner
just to kind of bring this out once
again it's going to make the eyes pop
it's going to make you look more angelic
and more fresh and doe-eyed and so I'm
just bringing that around I don't bring
it too far in on that lower lash line
otherwise I think it can look a little
bit frosty and messy then I'm going to
get my lashes a coat of any mascara that
you have I use black because I'm now
going to go in with black lashes these
are the velour lashes and strike a pose
I talk about these in my last video my
velour lash giveaway I also have a
coupon code for you guys so if you're
interested in that I'll put all the
information down below but these are
absolutely amazing they're so fluffy
they look so natural when they're on
they're easy to apply they've got a
thick black band they're amazing so I
thought they're very appropriate then
I'm going to use Maybelline illegal
length mascara and just coat the bottom
lashes if you don't have long bottom
lashes don't worry about this but I have
to worry about it because my lashes look
like they're covered in powder when I
don't do this and I'm going to use Bobby
Brown bronzer and this is in golden
light I believe and then the magic NARS
brush I still intend on doing a video on
this brush for you guys because I see
you guys have highly requested it and
I'm going to use this to contour so now
I did all that highlighting around this
my contour is going to be much easier to
do with all of that highlight underneath
because it's going to stand out so much
so you barely have to put any effort
into your contour and you'll be
completely done so I just do the my
cheekbones and then right around my
hairline on my forehead and that's it
and then I'm going to go back with the
balm this is mary loumanizer beautiful
highlighter and any big Brush this is
the fan brush by Sigma they sent it to
me and I was freaking out I feel like a
princess because it's like 18 karat gold
and oh my gosh I came and talked about
it and then I'm going to go in with this
peachy blush Kim Kardashian always wears
peachy corley colors this is honey
jasmine it's from the all about orange
collection that just came out at Mac I
got it just about five or six days ago
and I'm just going to blend this in with
my bronzer but put it
lightly above and buff it back make sure
you start on the apples of your cheeks
and then with a no additional product
above backward then I'm going to take
the Kardashian chroma joystick this is
an own natural and I'm going to coat my
lips with this and that wasn't enough
for me though it's a very pretty color
it's very nude but I wanted a little bit
more so I got into my lip bag Oh too
much and my god I got the makeup geek
lipstick and innocent and I put a coat
of this overtop it's a beautiful peachy
but pinky natural everyday shade and
then I got NARS Chelsea girls and I put
that over top for some gloss because
those girls always have glossy lips and
Kim Kardashian has worn this a few times
before so I think it's appropriate
anyways after that you're completely
done I hope you feel even more beautiful
than Kim Kardashian and have a wonderful
day
ma bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
