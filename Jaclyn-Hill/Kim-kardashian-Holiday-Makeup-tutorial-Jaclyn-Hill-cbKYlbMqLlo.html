inspired by Kim Kardashian he's going to
be on the cover of Glamour and it's like
a New Year's Eve festive fun girly like
sleepover inspired and I saw the promo
shots for it and I was like oh my gosh
yes don't think that like I'm trying to
say I look like her anything I know I
get it
I'm not cube if you're not so annoyed
did you haven't turn out this video
already keep watching okay so I have
already done my foundation and my
concealer and my eye primer I'm sorry my
eyes are still bloodshot I'm absolutely
exhausted um first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to take a highlight color
underneath my brow because Kim is always
beautifully highlighted any color would
work like right here any color from this
entire palette would work I'm going to
be taking dazzle light right there it
doesn't really matter river matches with
your skin tone anything light and I'm
going to take that and I'm going to hit
it underneath my brow up on this high
point and I know my brows are hideous
right now okay just push that around I
don't take it all the way in under here
because once you get the eyeshadow on
you're gonna realize that you don't
really want too much highlight there if
you decide otherwise you can go back and
do that later otherwise just hit it
there stiff brush anything you have it
doesn't matter if it's synthetic natural
whatever I'm just taking one like this
this is Mac and I'm going to dip it in a
pigment called vanilla and just looks
like that
it's a pigment I literally use this
segment probably I'm not even
exaggerating like 70 times in my life
and look at how it is still to the very
top I've never ran out of these in my
life never even close
so anyways I'm taking this color because
it is going to give you more of like a
cool glow and not as warm you could do
this with a gold but Kim's look she has
cool and warm tones
you know cool lips and then she's got a
warm tone in the crease so we're going
to put a cool tone here just to kind of
even everything out as you can see I'm
not going all the way over to this
crease right here and I'm not going all
the way into this crease right here I'm
just going to put the most generous
amount right here in the center of my
eye like right there on top I'm just
pushing that on there now any light
shade like this is going to work
anything with a little bit of shimmer in
it I mean you can use most neutral color
you have and this look is still going to
pretty much look the same you're just
going to see this when you look down and
close your eyes now for the rest of the
eye I'm going to be using two colors of
brown I'm going to be using texture
which has a little bit of shimmer in it
not much it's like this one right here
and when it's on the lids you're not
going to really see any shimmer payoff
whatsoever and then I'm going to be
taking soft brown soft Brown is more of
a neutral tone where texture is much
more warm um this look will really look
good on everybody pale skin I mean I'm
pretty fair - dark skin light eyes brown
eyes especially with this texture shade
if you have green eyes blue eyes this
will really make them pop so I'm going
to take the shade texture and I'm just
going to go in right here my crease and
I'm not going to go above my crease I'm
going to stay right here and like the
depths of it
staying low looks like that I mean at
first it's not going to be so cute but
we'll get there I'm going to place that
there I'm going to take it up and over
top of that vanilla pigment that we put
on over to this side and when we're done
with this step so now the pigment really
won't be very vibrant whatsoever it'll
just be a little touch a little
something in the center of the eyes and
do the same thing to the other side okay
now that we have that in there it should
look something like this you know it's
not like precise or anything just thrown
in there and now I'm going to take that
other color soft Brown again looks like
this just any neutral light brown this
is an amazing Brown for blending
anything it doesn't matter what colors
you're working with this is gonna look
okay so I'm just going to take that
let's do the side I'm going to take that
and go over top of that shade we put
down and above now I'm using a fluffier
brush this time that's longer and not as
dense because you don't have to be
precise with it whatsoever you can just
work everywhere I'm going to go down on
the lid over top of that vanilla just to
blend it all together like that and
honestly all haveno is going to do is
just give a little highlight in the
center of the lid with just a tiny bit
of shimmer and that's it
I'm just working over that then the next
step is going to be eyeliner and Kim has
a very dramatic wing in this look and so
we're just going to put your eyeliner on
like normal and then give it a real
intense lift up and out what I do is I
take my brush and I kind of go under
this area and then I swoop up and out
and that will line up with the line of
your eye from the corner of your eye to
your eyebrow so I just grab it like so
and there's the start of it okay and
that's how your eyeliner should look and
I understand that when you first start
doing winged eyeliner it is not easy it
honestly took me years to get this down
I mean I started doing this when I was
like 16 and I don't think I got it up
until like a year ago so don't get
frustrated just keep practicing buy a
cheap eyeliner and just work at it see
what you can do okay so basically I
didn't push record and I'm not happy but
like an idiot
I took max mulder pencil and I lined the
inner rim of my eye all down at the
bottom and then on top only in the outer
corner right here I don't go all the way
in because if you stay right here on the
outer corner it will give a super super
jet black on the outside and it'll help
that winged effect okay so now I'm going
to take a step tone brush where are you
stiff down brush I have officially let's
do okay like this one I'm going to dip
it in a texture that shade that we had
and our crease up in here and I'm going
to take that right underneath the
waterline in the outer corner right here
and I'm just going to lightly dust that
across the whole lid I'm sorry not lid
bottom part of my eye and it's gonna
drag some of that smolder down which is
good we want that alright now I'm gonna
go in I'm gonna add false lashes and I
will be right back so now I have my
lashes on which as you can tell really
adds fullness and fluffiness to this
look um so I'm going to just put on a
coat of mascara on my bottom lashes
because Kim likes the dramatic bottom
lashes which I do as well because it
definitely opens them up makes your eyes
appear much bigger
I don't just sit up here clumpy or too
thick I just want them really light okay
so now I'm going to zoom out so that you
can see everything else dipping it into
this white eyeshadow from Sir Kelly
doesn't matter what shadow it is I'm
going to take it and I'm going to just
dab it right on the tops of my
cheekbones um this is something that she
does almost with every look I've ever
seen
she always has a highlight here and you
can put it directly under that eye and
that wing right above there bring up
right above your eyebrow give that some
highlight flip it down the center of
your nose and then even take it and put
it right on your Cupid's bow because
when we put on that pink lip it'll
really make it pop okay I'm going to use
Pinchot peach by Mac um it doesn't
matter you could use any three of these
anything you have it doesn't matter I'm
gonna use this
you don't want to bring it too far up
you don't want to like put a blob right
there you're gonna have more like a doll
look you kind of want to swoop under the
cheekbones like in there just lightly
air it out okay now moving on to the
lips I'm going to take candy yum-yum
which was a limited edition color by Mac
I'm going to take a dazzle glass which
is from Mac as always it's called
steppin out and I'm going to put that
all over the lips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
