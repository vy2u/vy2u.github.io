doing this bronze look inspired by
Kourtney Kardashian for some reason I
tend to be more drawn to Kourtney's
makeup than Kim's love them or hate them
they're beautiful
undeniably and their makeup artists are
fabulous Kourtney always has that little
something that just makes me like love
her I don't know what it is she's just
her makeup is just gorgeous
okay the lighting has changed big done
the highlight is just always very gold
she has a lot of shimmer going on where
Kim can be more matte some of the times
so she's been doing basically all her
makeup artists I should say has been
doing basically the same thing recently
for the last couple of months and I have
a feeling that they're kind of playing
up that pregnancy glow because they keep
using that these really beautiful gold
glowing colors on her cheeks in her eyes
and sometimes she just wears false
lashes but no eyeliner other times she
does really thick band um I did the
thick band just for the purpose of the
video and also on follow me on Instagram
because I'm like not into that whole
social network thing I'm new here on
YouTube so I'm not gonna make like a
facebook page for my soul food or
anything um I don't have like a daily
vlog the only thing you can follow me on
is Instagram I know some of you have and
been awesome but that's where I post a
lot of makeup related beauty stuff and
if you want to leave requests to see
some videos please please do in the
comments below or on Instagram whatever
you want it'd be awesome oh and please
subscribe
love you bite okay I'm going in with
soft brown this is a matte shade and I
am tossing it in my crease with a big
fluffy brush and you do not have to be
precise with this we're going to swap in
inner corner and the outer corner just
all around to help blend the shades
we're going to put on next going in with
Mac's pigments in the shade can you
going in with a goat hair flat shader
brush I'm using this brush because I
want to pack it on smoothly and I don't
want to get too much on there now if you
want it to be thicker and heavier on the
lid you can use a synthetic fiber brush
but I just want this to be really dewy
and glowy I'm taking it all the way up
to the crease back and forth again you
do not have to be really precise with
this because we're
go with a different shape next that is
going to help blend it out this is the
shade saddle you see me use before and
I'm going in with a fluffy blending
brush and I'm going to put that in my
crease and directly in that crease right
there just going back and forth back and
forth and windshield wiper motions
always just getting deep in there and
then once we do that step we're gonna go
back with a clean brush the one we did
before just pick that back up and go
over it again and go back and forth and
swirl it around to help blend it out so
that there's no harsh lines the
kardashians always have really blended
out eyes shadow now I'm gonna put on my
eyeliner I'm not going to talk too much
about this I see that you guys have
requested um a lot of you have requested
for an eyeliner video so I've seen your
requests I hear you I will make one soon
as for right now I'm just throwing on
some black gel liner this is by the
Maybelline eye studio I believe it's
called I'm doing a thin little wing
nothing dramatic Courtney doesn't
usually do any dramatic wings for her
normal daytime look next I am using
dazzle light which is an eye shadow and
it's a gold shimmer because we want to
stay with the golds in this look and I'm
gonna pop that right underneath my
eyebrow okay this Sigma brush is amazing
it is this angled kabuki I'm obsessed
with it for foundation now I'm using Mac
Studio sculpt and their mineralized
satin finish and I'm gonna blend them
together because one is medium coverage
when a sheer coverage so together and
makes the perfect medium sheer coverage
and I sort of let you guys know that I
am using um an MC 30 in my foundation if
you know what that means a Mac term so
it's neutral cool thirty and it looks so
yellow on the camera for some reason and
it does not look like this in person I
promise you it is pretty true to my skin
tone in person I have asked my mom I
have asked my friends my family and
everyone is like no your foundation does
not look that yellow in person I don't
know what's wrong with my camera it
picks up the tones and exaggerate sit so
I'm sorry okay moving on to eyebrows I
am going to just butt brush it out to
the spool and I'm going in with Mac's
eyeshadow in the color cork
and I'm just gonna bring this shade all
through my eyebrows and in the inner
corner I like to be very light handed
and more heavy-handed on the outer wing
the outer wing should be a little bit
darker than the inner way and look at
that difference between my right and my
left eyebrow that is ridiculous love it
okay and I should make a video on this
and itself honestly because kind of hard
to describe this and very quickly and
there's so many eyebrow tricks that
there are but just make sure you like
have it on your inner corner and then
brush through it that really helps make
it look too natural then I'm going in
with select cover-ups and nw20
and this is obviously lighter than my
skin tone um my mom hates this method
but I might and this is very very
Kourtney Kardashian she would actually
wear a shady even a little bit lighter
than this um but this is fine for the
time being using my fingers it's going
to blend from the outer corner in to
help from creasing I put it on with a
brush jut that way my fingers don't
steal all the product but then I go in
and I warm up my fingers I rub them back
and forth like you see right there and
then I go in and I tap tap-tap you don't
want to wipe because you'll wipe it away
and your fingers will steal all the
products you want to tap constantly to
be blending it in at all times and then
after that I'm taking um either a
translucent powder or a light shade of
powder whatever you want and just
dabbing under my eyes I do this to
prevent my concealer from creasing under
my eye area because mine crease is
really easily especially in these hot
months and the humidity forget about it
okay now I'm taking saddle the same
color I use in my outer corner and I'm
going to dust that underneath my bottom
waterline you can be very free handed
and sloppy with this just go back and
forth make sure you get to the very
outer corner all the way into the inner
corner because her under eye area is
always really blown out it's never
precise and it's never a tight line so
just go ahead and throw it in there then
I'm using wedge which is the most
amazing color to blend any shade under
your eye area and I'm using the stiffer
brush and as you can see I'm just going
back and forth back and forth back and
forth I'm not doing anything special
everybody is afraid of this step for
some reason but
don't fear it just go for it okay now
that I have that done I'm gonna go with
an highlight color of my inner tear duct
and make sure you do this step before
the glitter liner it's so important that
way this highlight will peak out from
that glitter if you do this afterwards
it can be kind of a mess so I'm going in
with just this gold glitter from Sephora
urban decay is my personal favorite
because it doesn't burn your eyes it's
kind of burns but it's okay and as you
can see I'm getting this brush in the
very inner corner of my eye and just
bringing it out like a quarter of the
way maybe it's honey bit more you don't
want to bring it half way otherwise it
can look really off-balance you might as
well just go all the way then I'm going
in with red cherry lashes these are
number 43 and I'm just gonna pop these
on and I have to admit I got a little
bored waiting for my second lash glue to
dry so I went in with this bright yellow
and I just tossed it up there really
quick just to kind of bring a little bit
more yellowy gold to this look I got
bored whatever it happens now I'm going
in with my second eyelash and I'm using
my tweezers to do so I like using
tweezers because it gives it a lot
closer to your lash line so the glue
doesn't get all over your lashes and I'm
just throwing on some mascara to tie the
natural lashes and the fake ones
together and then I'm using Mac's give
me Sun bronzer with this elf powder
brush I just got it and I'm still not
sure how I like it for three dollars
it's a good brush but I'm still trying
to give it a shot because it's not
amazing and I was hoping that it would
be now I'm going in with copper tone and
this is a blush by Mac and I'm just
gonna put it on my cheeks and blend it
and with the bronzer that I just put on
this is a really beautiful coppery shade
and I think it complements the eyes
really well especially with those yellow
tones that we have in there then I'm
going in with a lighter powder and I'm
going to bring it under my eyes and down
and blend it into my blush a little bit
this is a trick that the Kardashians use
to help blend their highlight and their
blush together without having any harsh
lines
now I'm highlighting my cheekbones the
bridge of my nose and my Cupid's bow
with NARS albatross Kourtney Kardashian
uses this highlighter quite often and
it's a gold highlighter so it's really
beautiful especially for the summertime
now just draw on any nude lip color that
you have I'm using this ole
limited-edition one and then I'm going
over it with NARS Turkish Delight lip
gloss which is another one that the
Kardashians are fans of and after that
you are done so thanks so much for
watching and have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
