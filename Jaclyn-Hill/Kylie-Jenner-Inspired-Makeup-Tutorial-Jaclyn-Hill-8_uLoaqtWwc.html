a Kylie Jenner inspired makeup tutorial
when I did my reona inspired makeup look
a while back I asked you guys what
celebrity would like to see next and
hands-down Kylie Jenner took the cake
the reason it's taking me so long to get
around to filming this tutorial is
because for the last couple of months I
have actually been formulating a
lipstick inspired by Kylie Jenner her
lip color is just like crazy in the
makeup world and the beauty industry
people are just loving that lip color
and going bonkers over and so many
people have been asking me what the
combination I think it is what color I
think it is and I thought to myself you
know what I'm never gonna figure this
out
so let's create one so it's exactly what
I did I teamed up with Drori cosmetics
and we created a Kylie Jenner inspired
lip color I did the entire process
I was so picky about the formulation I
was so picky about the color that's why
it took me such a long time I am so so
happy to introduce this color to you
guys it is called 1995 and it is the
shade that I was wearing in my Instagram
post with my sister in California last
week and I'm so excited to finally have
this launched because it's been a long
time coming so it is going live on
Gerard cosmetics website right now at
this video is going up so I will link it
down below for you guys to go check out
if you guys don't know who Kylie Jenner
is or if you don't like her that's fine
no big deal this makeup look is so gonna
look gorgeous on everybody I don't think
I've ever done to make a book so
Universal on my channel before and this
one is when I saw so many requests to do
a makeup look inspired by her I
literally went to Instagram and stopped
this girl like I'll boom screenshot of
probably 30 pictures so it basically
took all these pictures like a true
stalker compiled them into one makeup
look that I came up with right here that
I believe is going to be extremely
Universal no matter what skin tone no
matter what I color you can rock this
look it is completely matte from
beginning to end there's no shimmer on
this look whatsoever and I personally
love shimmer I love to look dewy so the
fact that I like this everybody's gonna
like this because I never want to look
matte and I'm shocked by how much I love
it I keep looking in the mirror I'm like
I didn't love this it takes me back to
the 90s and I love the 90s that's why I
named this lipstick 1995 because I just
love the 90s I love the nineties style
nineties grunge and I'm he's music I
just love it hope you guys enjoy this
lipstick that I created thanks so much
for watching this video and if you want
to see how to get this kylie jenner
inspired makeup look then just keep
watching bye guys a fella I'm going to
be using that : more concealer to prime
my eyes in the shade nw20 I'm gonna go
in with makeup geek purely naked looks
like this has just a little bit of
shimmer in it not too much though where
it's not going to get in the way we're
blending it in our crease it's a very
youthful neutral brown color I'm just
going to take out on a big foot fluffy
brush this is a e-40 from Sigma I'm just
going to dust that in my crease area
I'm also than is you knew it because
let's get real I know you want to see
this bad boy up close yeah I am
initially when I pick up that pigment
starting on the outer edge so that that
is the most intense and then once
there's not much process on the brush
I'll bring an inward since this color is
light I'm just going to blend it upward
towards that brow area but I do not have
very much I have my brush right now I'm
just blending so we don't have any harsh
lines I'm going to go in with a morphe
eyeshadow in the shade
- it looks like this it is not a really
warm or really cool eyeshadow it's right
in between so it's a nice neutral shade
and I love the tone of it is it's got
some depth so we're going to take that
on a smaller more precise blending brush
and we're going to put that in the full
crease area and yes these are morphe I
shadows the ones I was talking about my
last video they're only two dollars a
pop yes please so I'm going to start in
this outer corner and I'm just going to
push it in that area and I'm going to
bring it around all the way about right
here I'm not gonna bring it all the way
in but I'm going to bring it about right
there and then just blend it back and
forth on the actual lip because at this
point I'm only working in the crease on
the actual lid you can really just kind
of bring this down however you want but
I don't want the lid to be as dark as
the crease
area I want the main product to be right
here in this section and then in a
little bit can come down this lid area
that's fine okay now I'm just going to
take a clean brush this is an e 25 from
Sigma and then just with absolutely no
products on it go over that entire
crease area because we need to blend so
now I'm going to go in and do my
eyeliner and I'm going to use Maybelline
eye studio gel liner in the shade
blackest black I'm going to use an e 65
right by mu by Sigma this is my favorite
eyeliner brush it's just a perfect
little angle it's nice and petite so
what Kylee typically does with her
eyeliner is she does a little wing and
then she keeps it nice and bold on that
outer corner and then trimmed it down
really quickly and it ends right in this
area where the eyelashes start to thin
out so I'm going to show you exactly how
to do that and what you're going to
start with is the inner corner you're
just going to trace it right along the
eyelashes and I pretty much can't talk
while I'm doing this because I'm talking
my eye is moving it has to be really
precise so I'll zoom even I'll show you
okay so as you can see I have literally
just like dabbed right at the lash line
and all I have created is just the
thinnest line ever on my lash line and
you honestly can't really tell that huge
of a difference from the side to that
eye but that's what we're going to start
off with and now we're going to create
the wing and once we follow it and we
connect it to this little line that we
have it'll come together beauty let's
hope and I do have an eyeliner video
that's kind of old so I'm going to walk
you through this right now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to follow the
bottom lash line of my eye up to towards
the corner of my eyebrow right like this
and that is going to be the exact line
I'm going to draw for my little wing I'm
doing
just like that so that line literally
goes from bottom lash line towards the
brow that's exactly how you follow that
and then if you do that on both eyes
your wings will always be even so now
I'm going to go ahead and connect the
dots
I'm going to be using the last of the
Rimmel lash accelerator this is one my
favorite drugstore mascaras and I really
really like it to coat my lashes before
I go in with false lashes just because I
think it makes them nice and long and
separated and your lashes don't get in
the way of your falsies sometimes if you
use mean it's too volumizing on your
lashes they can be too chunky and they
can really stand out laying against your
false lashes so whether you cannot
decide which lashes I want to wear these
are both from house of lashes this one
is called bambi and these are called
siren and i love them both and i do not
know which one I want to do I'm kind of
leaning towards dandy okay so I have
decided on Bambi oh my gosh these are so
much fun all I'm doing now is going back
with the same gel liner that I use in
the first place I'm just going over the
band of that lashes to cover it up
I never like to see the band of my false
lashes even though it's obvious these
are false I don't make them look even
more false than they need to look in the
first place if you notice a so now I'm
going to move on to my skin
Kylie usually seems to have great
natural looking skin even though it's
obvious that she's wearing foundation
she's just not taking it on as she
typically is all matte that's something
that I've noticed about her look is it
is very rare that she does any sort of
highlight the only highlight she will do
was like an under-eye highlight with her
concealer but it's still matte so I
wanted to do a foundation that is not
what to be dewy whatsoever or give me a
glow and make it forever as that
foundation for me if your oily makeup
forever is gonna probably make you a
little dewy but since I'm already so dry
this is not going to make me look dewy
whatsoever I'm going to look completely
matte in this foundation mostly this
color still works good I'm really going
to spread this all over my face so that
it's not too heavy so now that I've got
a light application of a foundation you
can totally still see my skin I don't
know if you can see in the camera but I
can still see my little freckles and my
blemishes so now I'm going to go in with
NARS radiant creamy concealer and I'm
using the shade custard and I was going
to apply this under my eye area I am
going in with a damp
whether it's going to make it even more
sheer
okay I'm going to just set that
under-eye concealer I'm going to be
using the anastacio banana shade from
her contour palette and I'm also been
using Mac emphasized as always I'm going
to mix those together but for this look
I'm mainly using the Anastacio banana
shade and I'm just going to set this
entire under-eye area
okay so mom's going to go ahead and fill
in my brows like normal I am NOT line
anyway I'm going to try to replicate or
duplicate kylie jenner's eyebrows these
we have completely different brows and
I'm not going to go down that road so
I'm going to fill them in like I
normally would one brow gel wanted to go
okay so now I'm gonna take a shade mylar
by Mac it looks like this right here
it's just a really really light shade
that has a pearlescent to it it's not
shimmer and it's not sparkle but it just
has a nice bling to it it just kind of
reflects the light it's hard to explain
it's a beautiful color very very neutral
basic I'm going to use this to highlight
underneath the brow bone because
whatever she is using up there is
extremely natural it pretty much looks
like she is nothing but I can see
there's a little something I'm going to
use that same mylar just to touch on
that inner corner for a really natural
inner corner highlight I'm going to take
just a touch of black I'm using makeup
geek corrupt and I'm using again the e15
a flat definer brush by Sigma I'm just
going to take this on that outer corner
right here and match it up to that
winged liner that we did earlier and
just press it into that lash line only
in the outer corner like that I'm going
to go back with the morphe eyeshadow in
the shade Sahara area I'm just going to
buff that back and forth
all I'm going to be doing is just
bronzing my face because she really
doesn't do much blush her face is left
very natural just a little bit of color
just touching the skin so I'm going to
be using Gerlach tech matte bronzer in
the shade Cabo sorry I'm blinding you I
have never used this bronzer before so
this is going to be my first we'll see
how it goes oh my god this bronzer is
for China
oh and the brush that I am using to
apply this is by Tom Ford I I can't talk
about it don't don't ask ok it just
looked so beautiful and was way too
expensive and I bought it anyways now
I'm in love it was an impulse purchase
and I'm not sorry so last but not least
we get to move on to the famous Kylie
Jenner a lip color and like I mentioned
the beginning of the video I did create
a lipstick inspired by the Kylie Jenner
lip color I am very proud of this lip
color it has taken a while because I was
so ultra picky I kept getting it and
sending it back I'm like nope too
pigmented - Brown - pink - mom - Rosie -
purple I'm going to put it on right now
for you guys without any lip liner if
you do choose to use the planner I would
suggest using Macworld lip pencil which
I've heard and read that that is the lip
liner that her makeup artist does use on
Kylie and world is going to go perfect
with this I made it so that it has like
the world color is in this lipstick so I
actually love this I'll show you exactly
how it looks my lips are super dry right
now - let me moisturize my lips really
quick and then I'll apply this for you
so there you have it that is 1995 and
1995 only on my lips right now with no
lipliner I just love this color so much
seriously I'm not just saying that
because I created it I love this color I
will list link down below it is going
live on drug cosmetics website today so
I will go ahead I will put the link down
below for you guys you want to go check
out 1995 I will also put a discount code
down there for you guys as well you will
get 25% off I believe my discount code
is just Jacqueline but I'll put it down
below and that will save you a decent
amount of money I mean unless you want
to pay full price that's up to you and I
leave you with just one last tip if you
want to make your lips look a little bit
fuller take just a bronzer I'm going to
use the bronze that I use or a dark
eyeshadow something that's Matt doesn't
have any shimmer on a blending brush and
then just lightly put it right
underneath that bottom lip just ever so
slightly and that bring it down a little
bit now that we don't have much on our
rock brush and that creates a natural
shadow making it look like that bottom
lip is kind of folding over and makes
that bottom lip look plumper so this is
a look very up close I will be honest
with you I was not expecting to actually
like this look on me as much as I do I
really hope that you guys enjoy this
