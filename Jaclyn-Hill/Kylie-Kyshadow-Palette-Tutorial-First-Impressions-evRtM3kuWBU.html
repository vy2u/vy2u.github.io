the most random video that I have found
in a really long time I'm going to be
doing a first impressions video on the
new Kylie cosmetics Kaito ah catch that
one
very clever huh because shadow bronze
eyeshadow palette this is so random and
unexpected I was not planning on doing
this I've actually had such a busy day
and it is currently eight almost eight
thirty eight twenty eight right now and
I decided to take a quick body shower
and run over here and film this video
for you guys because I received this
package in the mail today this was sent
to me from Kylie cosmetics just so you
guys know I received this package in the
mail and I jumped on snapchat and just
showed you guys some like finger
swatches and showed you the packaging
and the palette and all that jazz and I
asked you guys if you would like to see
me use this in a video or do a first
impressions and I'm not kidding I have
so many snaps requesting it that my snap
literally froze and shut down I went to
Twitter and I swear the tweets were
coming in so fast I could barely read
them just from people asking to do a
first impression and I'm gonna say thank
you because I mentioned recently I just
being in kind of a rut I haven't been
feeling inspired but I am taking action
to make changes in areas so that I can
help get myself out of that but honestly
you guys just seeing you so excited over
an eyeshadow palette has really just
made me so happy and you guys can just
kind of like reel it my excitement right
now for makeup and that's why I'm here
right now I am just like so happy to be
doing this right now I'm so appreciative
and thankful for you guys and your
excitement for makeup in general so I'm
just happy to be here the first thing I
want to say about this though is the
same thing that I saw on snapchat and on
Twitter a couple of nights ago is the
packaging itself slays my soul like when
I saw Kylie's snapchat of this I didn't
even care what was inside this box when
I saw this element ah oh god can you
imagine if I open it up and I'm all
shattered I would die I just think it is
so cool and different and can we talk
about this like can we talk about this
this comes whenever you order the
palette this comes in there with a
little note on the back and I like I
can't so this is what the palette itself
looks like right here you can kind of
get idea for the size it's like very
small and compact its cardboard very
extremely light
wait and on the back it has the shades
right there it has her signature I think
this is like the coolest concept right
here it's like so simple but yet it's
like very modern and edgy come on this
is like of course we all saw this we
were all like yes perfect I have
swatched this one this one this one this
one these matte shades right here on my
hand I showed you guys on snapchat I
will say the swatches are very very
promising but again that's just a finger
swatch so we will see how it actually
goes on the eyes I'm going to be
completely and totally honest in this
video I have absolutely no reason to lie
to you guys I never have and I never
will the data I start lying to you guys
for any reason is the day that my mom
will bet me over her knee and spank me
and shut my channel down I'll be totally
honest with you guys about this as I
always have been as I was honest about
her liquid lipsticks when I first came
out so I just got to put that disclaimer
out there no one is paying me I did
receive these this palette for free from
Kylie cosmetics and just got in today I
am doing this video by request and
that's all I have to say let's get
started I don't have already mentioned
but I do have my entire face of
foundation concealer and powder so my
base is already completely done so we're
going to go ahead and jump right into
the eyes and the first color I'm going
to pick up is this one right here a warm
medium matte brown I would compare this
to something along the lines of like Mac
saddle I'm going to pick up on a fluffy
natural hair brush it's not a supplies
guys I'm like anxious and excited to see
how these apply I'm going to just go
ahead and put this right in the crease
oh my gosh so far so good you guys I'm
liking what I am sharing and assume even
more so you can really see what I'm
doing it oh don't be scared now that I
have less product on the brush I'm going
to bring it all the way in to the inner
corner because I am going to cover my
entire lid with product today so I'll
just lightly feather it in there
applying just like any other shadow that
I like applies like it's applying
similar to makeup geek shadow it's
applying similar to Mac shadow which I
have to say on a different note I feel
like Mac shadows
kind of gone down recently like is that
just me because I've started using more
and more brands like my standards have
gotten higher but I feel like Mac
shadows used to be better
especially the shimmers I don't know why
but anyways not important okay so now
I'm going to pick up this shade right
above it which is idiot definitely a
little bit more of a cool tone has a
little bit more of a gray undertone in
it I'm going to be using the exact same
brush and this is the morphe m4 41 by
the way I'm going to go right over top
of that now just a little bit higher up
in the crease but right on top of it
this color is applying it beautifully I
mean since the first one applied
beautifully I'm sure all the mats will
but you never know because sometimes in
some palettes there's a lot of
inconsistency like one matte would be
gorgeous and then that's one right next
to it won't like blend you know I'm
saying alright now I'm gonna pick up the
middle shade oh it is so pretty and that
isn't a shade citrine sigh Trier to try
and like strong Cytron so trying oh god
I'm such an idiot going to take like a
less amount of it and I'm just basically
going to like take my brush and then go
like this and just like dab a little bit
oven it down a little bit in it just
that I have like a little amount in the
product then tip of my brush and then
I'm going to very lightly with a more
light hand go over that whole area just
to give it that warmth and brightness
then an orange shadow does oh yes Kylie
honey I'm a little impressed not gonna
lie
I'm gonna pick up a smaller blending
brush it basically looks the exact same
but just a little bit smaller and this
is the morphe m4 33 and i'm going to go
back in with that original color right
here with and I'm just going to put a
little bit on the brush and I'm now just
going to press this kind of on my lid
just like a light sweep just take at
that color because I want this to
basically be a matte look honestly you
guys these shadows are blending so well
I mean you can see it on camera you know
like you can't fake it you can see how
well they're blending they're not choppy
they're not streaky they're not patchy
I'm really impressed right now now I'm
going to grab this shadow all the way
down here and this is op Sedin
okay how come all these names are things
that I have no idea how to pronounce
like I need to go back to school and
this is a really pretty like medium tone
very warm rich reddish brown it reminds
me of like a Mac Swiss chocolate so this
one as I swirl my brush in this one it
did have more pickup than the others
right here but I will say I know just
from other stuff that I'm working on
that Reds are typically like that if you
ever swatch a shadow that has a lot of
red pigment in it and it kicks up a ton
of shadow it's really really tricky to
develop red undertone um I've shadows so
it does have a lot of kick back compared
to the other ones I'm going to go ahead
and put this out here and this has a
nice pigment too I'm going to pick up a
little bit more because I don't want
fallout yeah this has a really nice
pigment for a reddish shadow cuz again
it's really hard to get good
pigmentation when you're working with
red shades I know a lot of times in
palettes I'll be so excited about the
red color I like the cranberry color and
then when you actually go to use it it
is like absolutely no pigment in it it's
just very tricky to develop red I will
say this one is not applying as easily
as the others the others were so um like
worryfree and so easy this one I'm
having to kind of press it in a little
bit more but again that's probably
because of the red it has a little bit
more fallout but still
this is nothing that I would like
complain about this is just very
standard to me you know this is the same
as any other eyeshadow brand so now for
this part I am going to just bake my
under-eye really quick cause I'm going
to go in with the darker shades and I
just don't want like any of it to fall
out like the dark brown the black to
fall out and like mess up my foundation
so I'm going to grab some translucent
powder and a damp Beauty sponge if you
do your foundation first and then you
want to go in with dark eyeshadows and
you're scared that you're going to get
all over your face this is just a way to
make sure that you do not ruin your
concealer and foundation because you can
just sweep all the products away and
you're good to go I mean you look a
little bit like a freak while you're
doing it but whatever alright so now I'm
going to grab the middle shadow on the
bottom and this is in the shade Bronzite
and this again is matte so far we've
only worked with the matte shades and
what brush I want to use for this I'm
going to sit with the same exact brush
that I've been using and I'm going to
pack this on ooh this is nice pigment
I'm going to pack this on using just a
tiny bit right on the lash line area and
then just ever so slightly put it any
outer corner of my eye I don't want this
to be too intense so I'm going to keep
it kind of light for this part you're
not I'm going to do I shouldn't take
like just a small angle brush like this
one right here I'm going to dip in a
translucent powder and I'm going to
carve out I don't know if you guys have
ever seen me do this before but this is
a great trick if you want like a slanted
katish type eye but you don't want to
use tape or you have on foundation
already I'm just going to stamp it on
there just like this and then it will
make it so that we wipe it away you have
just like any media cat eye
I'm going to go back and I'm going to
grab a little bit of these two shades
and mix them together just a little bit
of that warm brown and that forms a tiny
amount on my brush not too much I'm
going to blend out this harsh line
right here on the edge just with tiny
little wiggling motions now as you can
see I'm slightly
um getting rid of my translucent powder
that's okay you have to worry about that
you can go back in and grab a little bit
more of it and just put it right over
top of that line and let it sit and it
will just continue to erase anything
that you bring down there all right now
I'm going to grab a pencil brush and a
pencil brush will do and then I'm going
to go in with the black shade right here
and this one looks like it's going to be
super black I'm going to take this and
I'm going to run it right along my lash
line
I am just dipping my brush like one dab
into the black because I don't want to
get tons and tons of fallout so when I
pick up the black I'm literally going
like Boop like one thing and then
tapping off the excess you can see the
pigment that it gives okay so at this
point I have used almost all the matte
shades except I have not used this one
just because I personally and not I like
matte white vanilla cream kind of girl I
know that tons of people are which is
why everyone was in their palettes I'm
not um for the purpose of this video I'm
going to go in with a shimmer color but
typically I would just leave it like
this and put on some lashes and mascara
and couldn't my brows and all that jazz
but I'm going to use one of the shimmer
so we can see how they apply and I don't
know what I want I'm going to do this
one it picks up nicely like I when I'm
grabbing it with my brush like it seems
to pick up nice it doesn't have like it
doesn't get chunky or anything so it's
going to go ahead and apply it right in
here in the inner corner okay so I'm not
getting much of anything on my eyes but
I actually thought about this when I was
applying the matte shadow beforehand
because most of the time when you apply
a matte shadow before a shimmer shadow
you don't get any color payoff and I
thought about that as I was applying the
matte shadow like if this was on just
regular bare skin I wonder if it'd be
different so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to like prime backup my hand
really quick and I'm going to apply it
to my hand to see if it applies better
because it might be because of the fact
that I just put a matte shadow down and
then shimmers don't work I'm going to
apply the exact same shadow that I just
tried to apply on my legs I feel like I
didn't give it like a fair chance I
don't want to say that it's terrible
before I try this so this is tigereye
again the same one that I used on my
eyelid I'm going to pick up the same
amount on my brush right there and let's
see if we apply it like this okay see
now look
now we're getting pigment like it's
supposed to have let me grab the other
eyeshadow wipe off my brush I'm going to
grab the other shimmer and try okay see
so they are showing up on my hand with a
brush
perfectly fine so I'm going to just say
that the reason that is not showing up
on my lid is because the fact that I use
a matte shadow first I'm going to go
back over with just a little bit more
black eyeshadow because I just want this
look to be smoky you know I figure for
doing a first impression videos of
eyeshadow like we get to do something
dark and smoky and really see what these
shadows can do right alright I'm just
grabbing a brush and wiping away my
under-eye area to get rid of all that
bacod and now you can see what that
transit powder did for my eyes how it
made it like a nice slant right there
see how it just cleans it up and gives
you a cat eye it's a really nice tip you
can see it right there I'm just going to
make this a little bit sharper size
looked over in that mirror and I was
like wait a second this looked a little
unblended if you ask me okay I'm going
to grab the middle shade right here in
the very top it's another shimmer and it
is in the shade quartz I'm going to
attempt to highlight my brow bone with
this I don't know it's gonna be too dark
so let's try this one I don't know we'll
find out oh ya know it works okay cool
it's working
I'm going over it with Jasper which is
the light creamy matte shade I'm going
to pop on a new pair of lashes I had not
tried yet and they are fluff and dolled
up so by velour lashes oh my god dolled
up I used to wear those back in the day
but these are like the new silk version
of them all right so now I have my
lashes on and I'm so mad at myself when
I was applying mascara I got it right
here like a huge glob and then I had
trying to get rid of it and I smudged my
eyeshadow and on my eyeshadow it looks
like it's all like unblended smear this
is my actual nightmare alright I'm going
to grab a pencil brush this is like an
old pencil brush from Sedona lace from
like years ago and I'm going to grab
this shade right here the warm kind of
caramel brown shade I'm going to just
put that right on my lower lash line
now I'm going to take this reddish a
brown shade in the far corner and I'm
going to put that right over top my the
only person that doesn't really look at
themselves like when they do this like
they just feel for it and just look
around the room I'm going to pick up a
small to finer brush like this right
here and I'm going to dip it into the
black I'm going to put that just on the
outer corner of my lower lash line I'm
trying so hard not to make my face where
I'm like always do when I apply shadow
on my lower lashline almost made it see
that I stopped myself it's not myself
real quick I'm going to apply some Mac
coast outreach eye pencil in my
waterline because I think my waterline
looks a little bare
all right so I just threw on some makeup
obviously to finish off my look but I
figured you guys don't want to see that
because this video is about this bad boy
right here right so I will say it might
overall take away from this palette is
that if you are looking for everyday
neutral basic palette it just applies
easily you're not looking for anything
that's too metallic you're not looking
for anything that's too difficult or too
bright or intense this would be the
palette for you it is a great everyday
like girl-next-door palette I will say
for me personally I wish that these
shimmers had more of a pop more like a
metallic nough stew it but that's
because I am secretly a drag queen in
science I always apply my shimmers with
mac fix+
or unless they're like a really intense
already metallic like foiled shadow I'll
if I go with a shimmer I wanted to be
shimmer like I don't want a subtle
shimmer
I want like glitter you know um but
someone like my sister who just loves
like that everyday look like she would
love these shimmers because they have a
nice color payoff but they're just very
subtle when I tried to apply it over my
matte eyeshadow and did not work but
honestly I was student for even trying
to do that the first place I know better
than that
but when I primed my hand and put it on
my hand with the brush they were
beautiful
so I honestly don't think that that's
kind of how she intended it because of
the fact that there are so many more
Mac's there's only two shimmers in the
nine color palette so I've done that she
didn't want these to be very vibrant and
intense obviously because she made them
a little bit more subtle as opposed like
a really intense like metallic creamy
shimmery eyeshadow you know overall I
would give this palette an a for sure I
would give the packaging an eight plus
this is sick nasty I love this packaging
so much if I was Kylie I would blow this
image up like gigantic like the size of
a wall and like put it above my couch or
my bed or something cuz I think it is
just so cool anyways I'm gonna stop
rambling thank you so much for watching
this video you guys I really hope that
you enjoy I love you thank you so much
for requesting this and I will see you
my next video mmm bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
