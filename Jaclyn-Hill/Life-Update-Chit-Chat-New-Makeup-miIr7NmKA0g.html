even know what the hell I'm doing I'm
gonna be honest I know one thing I made
myself a cocktail for this one I have
been really wanting to get this oh I
can't look at it without getting excited
like I look at it a viewfinder oh my god
it's just everything I dreamed up um can
we please take a moment for the fact
that I have an actual champagne bottle
covering glitter this is champagne
poppet but this is actual champagne
goals I will never open this ever and if
someone ever came into my home on my
turf and open this model they would get
shaked
so yeah I just wanted to get here on
camera and talk to you guys um I had so
many people tell me recently you know
like friends and some family members
tell me like just get on camera do a
makeup tutorial just get back to life
it's fine you don't owe anyone an
explanation you need to explain to
anybody what happened sorry my traffic's
my hair this is it's very hard to get
used to these extensions I swear I feel
like the majority of people in my life
they don't really get the connection
that I have with you guys and how I feel
towards you my mom gets it my mom
absolutely gets it she's been with me
since the beginning my mom is my
ride-or-die homie um but other than that
not a lot of people my life really
understand other than my mom and John
what YouTube is to me and what you guys
are to me I love you so much and I'm so
thankful for you and you have absolutely
no idea how grateful and appreciative
John and I are for all of the well
wishes and the prayers and the positive
comments and vibes just the wonderful
things you guys have set on social media
to the outpour of love I never in a
million years expected that and I'm so
ridiculously freakin thankful for you
guys which is why I'm here on camera
talking to you guys kind of want to talk
to you but what's been going on in our
lives
so it's been crazy um I'm kind of like
prolonging what I want to talk about I'm
kind of just like dancing on the subject
limp it's like another sip because I I
really don't want to have to go into
detail I'm not going to go into a bunch
of detail but I am going to talk to you
guys about with my boy Alex I know
there's so many of you out there that
are wondering what the hell is going on
at me and John's lives and I know a lot
of you know I
and so I was going to go ahead and cut
to the chase three weeks ago from today
it was a Sunday morning and my husband
John had a seizure we were laying in bed
and we had plans that day for my family
and my nieces like to come over and go
swimming at our pool and so he was kind
of like laying there talking about that
sky shooting the breeze like what you do
on a Sunday morning as husband a wife
right so it's kind of laying in bed
talking he'd been away for many five to
ten minutes and all of a sudden he
started making a very strange noise and
I thought that he was cold we set the
air very cold at night we like to sleep
in the freezing cold because we like to
buckle up and cuddle up in the covers
and sleep like buried in our blankets I
know a lot of people relate to that but
we make it cold so I recently like we
keep getting lower and lower lower when
we got married we set at like 71 then it
was except me then it was 69 in Java
like when I was like shut up and put at
68 and now we're like 65 it's ridiculous
but it's like a glue status in our house
but in the morning I wake up and a
little bit because I'm a hot sleeper I
wake up and I'm like it feels so good
and John always wakes up freezing so he
started making this noise where he was a
good like making the cup like a
shivering noise and I thought that he
was just complained he was cold and I
was it are you cold and all of a sudden
I was like what are you doing and he was
just seizing he was just full-on uh was
just he was convulsing he was having a
full-on seizure and I had absolutely no
idea what was going on I was in no way
prepared obviously for that moment I've
never seen a seizure in my life I've
been fortunate enough to never witness
that like anywhere from someone I know
or a stranger I've never seen a seizure
i called 9-1-1
immediately i'm on the phone screaming i
didn't remember what i say i literally
just like given my address and i threw
the phone across the room cuz I was just
like panicked and they called me back
like immediately obviously they had my
number like for my calm I hung up on
them I was so panicked and they call me
back and they're like you know I'm high
this is you know 911 one take a deep
breath I need you to put your hand on
his chest I need you to tell me every
time he breathes in so I started like
telling him like he's breathing in now
he's breathing in now they're like
alright he's breathing to stabilize the
parents are going to be there within
four minutes all sigh thank God and so
the paramedics showed up he had stopped
when John came to because
to know this but you know the past three
weeks I've learned a lot of uh seizures
and when you when you have a seizure you
black out so he was just gone like he
had no idea what happened and like all
of a sudden he that came to and he was
just like whoa what happened my
breathing which is really weird right
and I was like what I've never felt my
heart
do this in my life my heart was probably
at 200 beats per minute like I was just
flipping out all the cool I said he's
like dipole asleep and like I wish that
I could have kept calm for him but that
like no that was not gonna happen in
that moment and the thing that was worse
like the worst part about all of it for
me was the look in his eyes because as
he was seizing his eyes were open like
they see it some people's eyes are shut
some people's eyes are open his eyes
were completely open and just staring at
the ceiling and he just had so much fear
in his eyes and like it didn't look like
my husband it just looked like something
had taken over his body and it wasn't
him and John is not a fearful person at
all like I have fears like I'm afraid to
fly I'm afraid to get too deep into the
ocean he doesn't have fears really and
so just to see that look in his eyes of
just fear made me feel so much sadness
for him and it was just that's the thing
that's like the most traumatic for me is
the look in his eyes I had to see like
that's been the hardest thing for me to
overcome I just felt so sad for him and
like oh I just I really thought that he
was gonna die and I know two people out
there who like your loved ones have
seizures you have seizures you were
probably thinking like girl you're fine
like it happens but for the person
watching their loved one have a seizure
for the first time it is absolutely
traumatizing and I don't think anyone
can discredit that it was just it was
horrifying he had a cat scan while he
was there in the hospital and the doctor
came in and said the cat scan was
spotless I broke down I cried like a
baby John was so relieved I kept telling
John like no matter what happens like
we're going to get through this it does
not matter what they find and anything
like life is gonna go on and we're gonna
get through this like I was trying so
hard to be strong but deep inside I was
just like a scared little girl who just
wanted her mommy um at this
wait he had he went to a specialist he
had an MRI and eg and a cutie eg a
couple of different things several
different things and everything has come
back totally normal totally spotless so
thankful like you have no idea so
thankful people have seizures all the
time apparently that they have no reason
for them like the doctors have
absolutely no idea they're like oh it
could be the caffeine it could be
dehydration it could be this it could be
that we have no idea so at this point
it's kind of a waiting game there's
people out there who have had a seizure
and then they have they don't have
another one for a year and then they
have another one a year later and they
have another one a year for that and
there's absolutely no reason why there's
always a possibility that could happen
again and it could change our lives and
Rock our worlds forever if that does
happen it happens like we'll get through
it but this whole thing has completely
and totally put things into perspective
for the both of us after that happened
we just decided to take a step back from
social media and is really embrace each
other and our loved ones because you
know it was it was a wake-up call to say
the absolute least like I remember I was
in the hospital and we had been there at
this point for like eight or nine hours
and I got on my phone and I was like at
this point John wasn't even in the room
they were doing testings on him and I
was talking my mom my sister and so on
so forth I was taking them awhile and I
opened up my phone and I opened up my
Instagram and the first thing I saw was
some shitty comment from someone just
about just something random and stupid I
don't remember just something about me
and probably being fake or money-hungry
or whatever maybe just something and
when I saw it I was like I cannot
believe that I had even allowed these
types of comments to affect me in any
way
I am so pathetic like I just in that
moment felt like I cannot believe what a
little bitch I have been and ever since
then I have had a completely different
look at what people have to say about me
who don't personally know me when I say
know me like know me because I'm
definitely someone who when you need me
the first time you're going to get like
the outer shell you know I'm a cancer
and we're the crab so when you mean
you're going to get my hard outer shell
but inside I'm very soft crab meat and
you know if you don't truly know me for
who I am
you don't know my heart and soul then I
really do not give a damn what you have
to say about me and that is something
that I feel like I have gotten back I
just feel like I have to tell you guys
as my subscriber that I am truly from
the depths of my soul embarrassed and
sorry for ever just letting the hate get
me down change who I am change the way I
may act at times like it is so
embarrassing the girl who first decided
to turn on the camera and start youtube
videos in the first place is not the
same girl I have been the past couple of
months maybe the past a year or two I
have a loud negative people to get into
my soul and get into my mind and get to
my heart and get into my life and change
me in ways and that is only my fault
that is not to the negative people's
fault I take full responsibility for
that
I just feel like I've lost myself at
times on camera and on social media and
I get so caught up and the things people
say about me and it hurts me so much
because I'm so obsessive people knowing
that I'm not all these horrible things
and I'm not a liar and I've never lied
and I'm was like if only they knew the
truth the past couple weeks my mindset
has just completely flip-flopped and I
haven't cared what negative people have
to say but at the same time when I see
people being nasty to me on social media
I have no problem standing up for myself
because that's the thing is that's the
Jaclyn that I've always been my whole
life
if someone mouths off to me or my
friends or my family like I'm gonna
stand up for myself I have the right I
don't want to be nasty I'm not a nasty
person but like I can always defend
myself at the same time like I am so
sorry and saddened and the fact that
I've ever like people get into my head
because everything that has happened the
past couple weeks has just put all that
into perspective the fact that my
husband is alive right now and my family
is alive my niece is my nephews they're
all healthy like I'm so blessed beyond
reason I am choosing happiness I am
saying yes to my happiness and to my
freedom and to my
freedom and I'm gonna be me and if that
means me doing 17 more smokey eyes
back-to-back-to-back then that's what
I'm gonna do because I don't actually
care about views and pleasing the
negative nancies I care about makeup and
living life and having fun and enjoying
my passion and being free and young and
spending time off my family and my
friends and making you guys laugh and
smile and making you feel a piece of
just happiness and freedom like that's
what I care about and that's what I'm
gonna get back to out with the old in
with the new and that's why I wanted to
dye my hair and change my hair because I
just felt like every day for John
seizure-like I couldn't control what was
going on I couldn't control was
happening but those change like our
entire life that was to change in us and
in our world in inner I know a future
does everything had changed and I was
sick of looking myself in the mirror I
thought look just like so cheap I was
like I'm done with this look I kept my
hair dresser and I was like help a
sister out
can we go dark we go long like let's get
a pop in it so yes this is not clipping
expansions I'm gonna move the
conversation along this is not clipping
extensions these are actually taping
extensions like sent you right up you'll
see it because my hair so dark but
they're like big fat extensions and
they're taped right at the root of the
hair my natural hair is so really right
now you guys so this video is prolly 45
minutes this point but I do just want to
really quickly show you this because
honestly I was so excited oh my god you
probably expected this from me honestly
but this is the mariah carey matte
collection i'm sorry i have to i have to
fold this song really quick just bear
with me alright
you don't understand when I was like 13
years old I was so since the song I sing
it have every title I sing boy busted I
say this at my recitals get ready
Mariah have to bring it home even know
this that's like my favorite Harry song
of all time now let's get real my
favorite current day Mariah song so
obsessed and no it's not because I think
the world that's guys with me so this
collection now that they are all into
like sending out PR stuff what they
never they never have been in the past
but like the past three or four months
all of a sudden Mack has just been like
sending like everything and I'm like
over art I'm like wait a second
my gratis wasn't this good like this is
freaking bomb did you give this to your
employees dumb
cuz like oh my god this is amazing it
came in as a beautiful package when I
opened it up I was like hi there she is
just there there there she is there she
is just she's just she's right there and
can we just take a moment to look at
this presentation and I'm gonna be
honest when it came it looked much
prettier but immediately pulled
everything out I was shoving up my
buttholes I was so excited there's two
actual pallets can we talk about the
glitter around the edges of this
eyeshadow palette what yes Mac come
through but look at these gems like the
whole box is put all of these gems like
I just want to put my entire body in
this I can I do like a full size pool of
these gem so I can just be like into
news you know interviews this right here
I like crap my pants I'm gonna be honest
I mean I wasn't gonna be honest and
actually crap my pants
just so you know those are you take
these literal I was it actually like
crapping myself but almost
this is highlighter right here called my
Mimi my Mimi in case you didn't catch
that and it's an extra dimension
skinfinish was my which is my action cut
junkie so fat which is my actual
favorite formula in matte highlights
it's so beautiful and look at her face
just casual okay let me just throw my
face on a highlighter now for my skin
tone I could not use as a highlight
because it definitely like when it would
reflect it would look like muddy as you
can see right there but I can put this
on the apples of my cheeks and it can
get that beautiful golden glow if you
are more chocolaty in skin tone girl
don't sleep on this beautiful blush this
is called sweet sweet fantasy I'm sorry
you guys my hands it's a it's a spray
tan gone bad what's new let's get real
but it's a really pretty kind of like
rosy peddling pink a match I love these
I really like matte blushes more than
anything and then they gave us some with
our good ol little liquid liner as
always I think this comes in every
collection but it's cute because in like
a gold packaging with her little
signature on it you guys but lipstick
first of all the colors bomb but the
packaging though like what is this hi
how are you like what is this like pure
glitter this is the frosty one which
amok in a line doesn't excite me that
much this is in the shade all I want but
this one is in the shade Mik izl oh my
god
all her lipsticks have a butterfly and
great on them so gorgeous so mariah and
then her signature is right there so
pretty and then the last lipstick is
this one right here which is a really
really pale nude which I of course I'm
absolutely obsessed with and this is in
the shade bit of bubbly so pretty like
this is the prettiest clutch my Mac has
ever done they did a body powder with a
little poof go that's not amazing it's
called touch my body a loose powder this
reminds me of the powders the Victoria's
Secret used to sell do you remember
those with the huge poof's oh my god bro
I was obsessed every single day I don't
throw these walk the bathroom like 11
years old wash my face and grab that
goofin big literally like full body
highlighter challenge and then for the
lip glosses there are three gorgeous
shades there's like a really really
light pink vanilla shade and there's
Anna medium peachy pink shade
and there's a go darker golden amber
Sheen which i think is so awesome
because it's gonna fit three different
skin tones from light medium and dark
which is really smart so Mariah and her
team added a bob job and they came out
with lashes as well which I just I love
the packaging the fact that it has her
signature me just say though I'm going
to be honest even though I love Mariah
Carey I love her music I always have I
can't help it every time I think of
Mariah Carey I think of Eminem and the
fact that she does Tim and I'm like
because at the end the day she might be
queen but Eminem is my mother King I
just want to share that with you because
I think that's amazing and I never want
to like Bradley look at what I got in PR
but like I remember when I was like
being a mountain girl for all those
years we did not get gratis like that
that is some bougie over-the-top she
isn't it that I am a very thankful for
um but yeah that's it I also got this
awesome Kylee package which I was really
excited about as well for the holidays
right here I thought this was really
cool like this stocking I mean I'm not
gonna hang this up just being real
marketing is I'm going to give to
someone who actually really appreciate
it um but this whole thing it has like
diamonds in it or something I don't know
something very extra like that but
amazing and is ours I think that well I
think that Kylie cosmetics in general
has gotten so much more luxe recently
the formulas have gotten so good I mean
I really genuinely love the eyeshadows
and then matte lips I've been really
liking them some of her darker colors um
can definitely be kind of patchy I've
noticed they're not all consistent but
in general like she has stepped up and I
have big mentor from the beginning you
guys follow me on snapchat and if you
remember when her line first launched I
told you I did not like her liquid lips
but I said like you know I still stand
by it most people when they launch a
brand they spend a couple thousand
dollars and they launch a brand and they
hope for the best in their initial order
as you know five hundred units of each
thing in their initial Pio and Kylie
Jenner probably ordered five hundred
thousand of each color and it's sold
out in minutes and the whole world is
breathing down her neck and is like and
she even have time she didn't have room
for improvement it's like the whole
world was waiting like on their
computers ten minutes before it would
live and now most people have to deal
with that kind of pressure so I feel
like everyone deserves that period to
kind of get their together and I
feel like Kylie cosmetics has got it
together and I feel like the proxy come
out are really nice that her cream
shadows are nice her liner is nice like
her gel liner I really like it her
eyeshadows are nice her matte lipsticks
have improved big-time like I really I
really do like the brand and I love the
packaging so I think I've come a really
long way but yeah anyways this video is
all over the place I know you guys I
know anyways I hope that you guys maybe
enjoyed hanging out with me a little bit

enjoyed sitting here talking to you
