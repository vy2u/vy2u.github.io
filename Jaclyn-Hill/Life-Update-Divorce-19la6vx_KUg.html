even say for an intro in this video like
this is definitely a video that I never
thought that I would actually be filming
when I thought about the possibility of
having to film a video like this one day
it would make me sick to my stomach and
now I'm sitting here life is crazy
that's all I can say I don't even know
where to start I don't even know the
point of this right now
honest to god I feel so out of my
comfort zone I feel so vulnerable I feel
so insecure huh and I apologize that
there's a thunderstorm outside so you're
probably hearing the thunder and my dogs
are barking at it because my dogs are
super intelligent and they run around
the house trying to chase the Thunder
and barking at it sorry I had to make a
joke otherwise I was gonna cry the whole
time and that can't happen I just know
that in my heart I have to make this I I
have to give this to you guys and I know
that I have to close this chapter on my
life and in order to move forward this
video is just necessary and I don't feel
like I or John Oh any explanation to
anybody at all I'm not about to drag our
dirty laundry out on social media on
YouTube whatsoever so I don't feel as
though we owe any explanation as to
what's going on and why things are
happening but at the same time I do owe
my subscribers who have loved me and
supported me an explanation as to why I
have been so absent for so long because
in reality I have slacked on YouTube for
a good year at this point and so if you
guys have not seen John and i's
Instagram or my Twitter we did announce
that we are divorcing I know that there
are so many people out there who are
wondering why this is happening what the
hell is going on there's so many sweet
people that are so heartbroken the
amount of emails I have gotten and
comments I mean there's like over 40,000
comments on that photo that I posted and
all of them for the most part are just
kind supportive broken hearted comments
and it just makes me so sad like I had
to stop looking at them because it was
just like
breaking my heart because I just know I
know what you guys saw John and I ass
and that kills me
because you never know ever and I've
always been the first one to say this
you never know what's going on behind
the camera whether it's a relationship
or it's just someone battling day-to-day
stuff you know we're like anxiety or
depression that whatever it may be like
people are good at putting on a happy
face for an hour and ha and then turn
off the camera and John and I were the
masters at that you know he was at the
end of the day John and I loved each
other very much I mean like I I love
John so much I was so in love with him I
still love him I've cared for him so who
deeply like oh my god I would have got
hit by a bus for John and I will care
for him and I will love him for the rest
of my life and I can only speak on my
behalf because John is not here to talk
for himself I know it sounds weird but
like truly we still talk I still love
him we actually still joke around John
and I have great humor John and I make
great friends like John and I can sit
down together even going through a
divorce and laugh and make jokes about
it and like be silly like as a friend
like we work so well but as husband and
wife and as partners in life it's just
it's not there it does not work John and
I have never made good husband and wife
we've never made good partners we've
always made good friends and like we've
always been good like buddies you know
like and it sucks and after almost nine
years of marriage it just got to a point
where it's like we had to finally like
face the music and look at what this was
and actually address it head-on and be
like this it can't go on you know it
just it can't and there's so many people
out there you know who have left
comments and tweeted me being like you
know kids you just give it one more shot
can't you make your marriage work have
you tried everything I mean like do you
guys think that me and John just decided
like two months ago like oh let's get a
divorce that sounds like the perfect
thing to do right now like John I have
had problems our entire marriage and we
have been very upfront about
but we have always always worked at
overcoming them we've always worked at
being bigger than our problems and
loving each other harder than our
problems and I just got to a point where
it was exhausting and it's like I was
like bled dry and it's like there
there's nothing left to give because
it's just like we're going through
couples counseling and just so much
therapy and like just trying so hard to
make the other person happy and we're
just fighting all the time and I'm just
resulting in just anger and bitterness
and it was just getting ugly and it's
like it's like one of those questions
where it's like at what point do you
have to give up your happiness for
somebody else's I believe that no one
should have to do that unless that's for
your child unless you're giving up your
happiness for the love of your child you
shouldn't have to do that for your
husband you should have to do that for
your wife you know you shouldn't have to
let yourself go you shouldn't have to
change who you are to make somebody else
happy it's not fair and all I want is
for John to find an incredible woman one
day who's gonna love him and treat him
so well and just give him the world ah
that woman isn't me then it sucks to
admit that and it's been really hard and
humbling but I believe everything
happens for a reason and even if I don't
know that reason I have learned so many
lessons through this process oh god I
don't want my tears to drip hold on uh I
know that so many people out there are
speculating like what really happened
what's the juicy gossip what did John do
what did Jaclyn do and it's like someone
tweeted me and said I need to know the
truth of what's going on between
Jacqueline and John so I can decide
whose side that I'm on I'm like what the
hell like is this real life like we're
we're choosing sides and divorce like
when I see people announce on social
media they're the divorce scene that
ever comes to my head like Oh whose side
am I on what did they do like no like
sometimes it just doesn't work sometimes
no matter how much you love somebody it
doesn't work it sucks but like I
remember when I was young people always
say oh you're getting married because
you're young in the love
well love doesn't pay the bills sweetie
and I was like
screw you you have no idea you've
obviously never been in love like me but
at 27 years old and after eight and a
half years of marriage I can say I
actually understand what they're saying
like it doesn't matter how much you love
someone like you have to be good
partners in life you have to make good
teammates you have to be able to
communicate properly you have to be able
to meet in the middle you have to be
able to compromise and have
understanding towards one another I will
always love John it will always care for
him I hope that he is always a part of
my family I hope that he is always an
uncle to my nieces and my nephew uh I
said to say overall that um number one I
am sorry for my absence I am sorry for
slacking so much on YouTube for the past
year give or take it has been a hard
year to say the least there has been so
much going on I mean not only did John
and I move into this house together
we've had so many issues and we've been
going to couples counseling and therapy
and trying so much and just like things
just were just getting worse and worse
and uglier and uglier trying to get on
camera and like show a happy face even
just like blending out my eye shadow it
was hard to do I just felt like I swear
to like word vomit big Oh John and I are
unhappy this sucks
like these pictures that we're posting
like we look so happy but it's not real
like we're actually fighting or
miserable we're trying so hard to make
this work but it sucks and like we're
miserable like I wanted to be able to
say those things but I couldn't I just
felt like like just disgusted with
myself and it's just oh I don't know
like I just I did not want to let you
guys down I know it sounds so stupid but
it's like this is my marriage and my
life and my happiness and I deserve my
happiness and John deserves his
happiness but I I carry a lot of guilt I
wanted to be able to give you guys
something to believe in forever I know
it sounds so stupid but you guys
encouraged me to stick out my marriage
for as long as I possibly could because
I just wanted to be that for you
I wanted to be that positive role model
as a marriage cuz I honestly don't have
a marriage that I look up to that I'm
like wow that's what I want to be like
my parents are divorced you know I don't
know a marriage it's been together for a
really really long time who's been due
Helen back you know and still kicking it
so I wanted to be that so bad and I'm
sorry that me and John couldn't be that
for you but out of my love for John out
of my love for myself I had to let him
go and I actually am right now very
happy with this decision I know that's
probably hard for you guys to hear but I
have been mourning the loss of this
marriage for so long I have been so
heartbroken I have cried myself to sleep
so many nights I mean over the holidays
I was just every single night going to
bed by myself just bawling my eyes out
it was terrible and no one knew you know
I'm like throwing a holiday party with
my friends and family and putting on
like the best face that I possibly can
just like please please like let this
work
by the way I am NOT asking anybody to
feel bad for me I'm just trying to tell
you guys where I'm at I actually don't
want anybody to feel bad for me I don't
want anyone to be like oh that's so sad
because this is just real life it
happens breakups happen divorce happens
it sucks but going through it it's
harder than like what you actually
imagine you know which is it's been
really hard but I'm a big girl John is a
big boy I will be fine he'll be fine and
I'm finally at that point right now
we're like I I see the light at the end
of the tunnel on him and even though
I've always know that this is what's
best right now I'm starting to finally
feel like yeah this is what's best I
just keep telling myself sometimes the
hardest decisions are the best ones
sometimes you just got to grab your lady
balls and do what needs to be done you
know love yourself enough to be happy
even though it sucks
for a while it sucks ass even though I
have been so emotional filming this
video this has been so hard knowing that
so many people are gonna watch this so
many strangers and knowing that so many
sweet kind people who just love and
support me and have supported our
marriage are gonna watch this and be sad
and all those thousands of comments I've
seen online it just break my heart like
it makes me so emotional but I don't
want you guys to think that I'm not
gonna be okay I don't want you guys I
think that this is gonna break me
because I can get through anything
and I'm not saying that to be cocky I'm
saying that because I believe in myself
and I want you guys to believe in
yourself and I want you to know that the
most important thing at the end of the
day is the love that you have for
yourself because if you don't love
yourself you can't love anybody else and
it doesn't matter how cheesy that sounds
you have to love yourself enough to
allow yourself to be happy and sometimes
you have to let people go no matter how
much you love them or no matter how much
you're just like addicted to that or how
comfortable they are you know it's like
sometimes you have to love yourself
enough to let that go even if it means
you cry yourself to sleep for six months
or a year like it sucks but I am getting
to a place where I am feeling confident
and I am feeling better and things are
going to be okay I will forever love
John he is gonna be one of the top most
important people in my heart hopefully
forever I love him so much and I care
for him so deeply and I just want
nothing but happiness
that's all I have to say I just want to
end this on a more positive note because
I don't want you guys to leave this
video thinking like oh my gosh he's so
broken and this is so terrible because I
was broken but that's why I didn't make
this video six months ago I wanted to
wait until I was at a better part of my
life where I was at a better point in
this situation you know where I could
actually be strong for you guys I'm so
grateful for you guys and thank you
thank you even when you didn't know what
was going on in my life for still
supporting me you've no idea how many
comments I got and how many tweets I got
from people just saying like I don't
know what's going on your life
Jacqueline but you've been absent so
much recently you haven't put on
snapchat as much you haven't been on
social media as much you've barely been
filming and I just want to send my love
and support and tell you that you're
amazing and I miss you and you have no
idea I would read those comments and
just get so emotional come like oh my
god like you guys have no idea how many
screenshots I have in my phone I'm just
support him kind comments and tweets
because it's just like I needed that so
bad and you had no idea that I actually
needed it you had no idea the impact
that your kind words had on me so thank
you for being there for me even when you
didn't even know what was going on
it means the world so yeah alright
that's it you guys I have nothing else
to say I
Wow I will probably be deleting this
video after a period of times because I
don't want this to sit on the internet
forever and just like bake and sit there
and I don't want this to define me I
want this to define John and that's it
all right uh I love you guys and thank
you and I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
