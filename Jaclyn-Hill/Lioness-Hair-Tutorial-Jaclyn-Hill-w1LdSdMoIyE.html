lot of noise but I love this hairstyle
I've been wearing it constantly recently
so yeah I hope you guys enjoy and I will
see you soon
bye hey guys so today I'm going to be
doing a tutorial with the new new me
pentacle deep waver wand flume
that is a mouthful I don't know if
that's actually like how it's all phrase
together but that's basically what it is
is it's a deep waver so I'm going to be
doing this tutorial for this because I
have never gotten so many compliments
and questions on how I style my hair
recently in my life and I have a
discount code so I figured it was a
perfect time to do a video because if
you guys really like the way it looks
and you think you're interested in it
then you can get it for a great price
right now
so let's just get started okay so first
thing I'm going to do is just take out
my bun I've had this in since last night
I slept on it so my hair is gonna be a
little crazy but that's okay
that's why I love this wand so much
because no matter how your hair looks
it's gonna just make it work it doesn't
matter if it's kinky or frizzy or curly
or straight
it'll just pick it up and do it needs to
do oh oh my god my ends are so split all
I'm doing is just brushing out my hair
so that there's no knots and so that I
don't have to go through and brush out
every little strand as I go that way
it's just over and done with I take my
hair and section them off
using Clips like this you can find it at
the drugstore you can find like a four
pack of them for super cheap and I just
take a section of my hair so I usually
go right here by my ear area and then
straight back like this then I'll pull
it up and away from that so that I just
have this bottom portion right here just
a thin layer of hair and then I will
take this and just twist it around
doesn't have to be cute and click this
to my head now we have this hair right
here and then that's where I start I
always start at the bottom and work my
way up to the top okay so I have this
one done right here and then of all I'll
do is take another piece of hair you
don't want to go too thick or too thin
this is about the perfect size you don't
need to go anything like tiny that's
dramatic so I would say what I'm
spreading it out it's about the same
length as my fingers just like that you
get too much you'll know because the way
won't kind of trade is deep so you're
just going to clamp as close to the root
as you want holding this hair just let
it hang and then when you lift up you'll
see that crimp that you have then you'll
go next and line line it up so that this
down point part of this wand is matching
this up point if that makes sense you do
not have to be precise when I do this
I'll do it super super quickly and I
never notice that like oh I missed this
one spot where it doesn't go down up
like it's not a big deal you don't do
super precise and I'm looking in the
mirror behind me right now so I'm sorry
and then you just go to the very bottom
and then this one right here like we
have a little bit of hair hanging out
you don't have to worry about it it kind
of just blends in with the rest and no
one's going to be staring at the ends of
their hair so we have it like that and
then we'll go and do the back area I
already have this piece right here
it's so boring doing this because like
normally I have on like music or TV or
something to distract myself I'm just
doing my hair but when I'm filming I
don't want to distract like you guys so
it's just so blase I'm so bored I don't
think I've used the word bored since I
was 13
like why would you ever actually be
bored just entertain yourself
okay I'm babbling so you can see that
hair that I just did was much thicker
than the other ones and it still came
out the exact same so you can see how
that looks
I usually don't run my fingers through
it and tousle it up until the end and
just because I kind of let it sit there
with that fresh wave in it because I
think that once you let sit for a while
and when you're done with everything you
kind of tousle your fingers through it
it'll look a lot better than doing that
now because it'll just like take the
heat out and cool it off really quickly
and it'll just lay flat on your head so
next section I just do the same thing I
did it just like an inch above the ear
at this point for the next portion I
usually do about three to four tops
sections I'm going to clip that part on
top of my head again so that's out of
the way and then grab this hair you can
grab a piece like that sighs if you wish
doesn't really matter I mean the smaller
pieces you get the more intense of a
crimp you'll get just like the longer
you hold the one for the more intensive
a crap you'll get but okay I'm going to
fast forward
at this point in curling my hair I like
to take this area just surrounding the
forehead and pull it towards me as I'm
curling it and the reason being is that
if I hold it like this again with the
rest of the hair it's going to just go
straight down like this but if I hold it
towards me it'll kind of come towards my
face which I like that full big the
lunch the luminous effect so I just hold
it like this
and then I curl like this so it's like a
little sideways but it just gives more
volume and has more body once everything
is complete and it doesn't lay flat
straight down it comes towards me which
I like
once I get up to the very top of my head
and I now have my part I'm just going to
take the first strand and when I touch
down I'm going to hold it straight up
and just do it as quick as I can just
like that and then as I go down I hold
on more and more but up right next to
the scalp you can see that I barely even
touched it down otherwise you'll have a
huge kink right here at your scalp and
you don't want that you want it to be
gradual
so once everything is curled I will then
take something like this got to be
powerful volumizing styling powder I
think I showed this in my last hair
tutorial that I did um it's like my
favorite thing ever I if you like volume
you will love these powders you just
shake into your hand like powdered sugar
rub your hands together and then you
just run it through your hair now it
will make your hair feel dirty which I'm
okay with because I have dry hair so it
takes my hair literally like 15 days to
get oily or dirty so I don't mind this
feeling at all but I just take this and
I use it to just separate all the waves
that we just put in and if you want your
waves deeper or more intense than this
that's not hard to accomplish all you
have to do is hold tighter on the wand
and for a few seconds more but I don't
like mine super super intense because I
think they're more wearable like this so
then we have that and you can see how
that powder works whoa okay so last
thing I have been doing just to finish
off this look as I take just a chunk of
hair from this area right here in the
front just about this big and then what
I will do is make a small braid so as
you know you want to grab three separate
pieces and then just start braiding and
as you're braiding it you want to hold
it backward and I make it really loose
so don't pull tight as you go I know
this is hard to see because my hair is
super dark I'm sorry so I just braid
this back pretty much to the ends of the
strands and again holding loosely cuz I
don't want this to be a tight braid
so we'll get to this area right here and
then I will take a bobby pin and I have
a blonde one don't ask but will still
hide it so I'm going to take this braid
I'm going to push it under my hair and
then this part that's against my scalp
and then just push upward and then take
this hair right here and let that fall
over top of it so then you have that
braid right there and that's why we want
it loose because we don't want that to
be super tight I want it just to chill
out and this is a hairstyle that I like
the most after I have been wearing it
for a couple of hours when I first do it
I like it like this but it always looks
better a couple hours later and actually
my favorite is when it how looks the
next day when I wake up that is it for
this look for those of you who requested
this video I really hope you enjoy if
you're like me and you're all into
makeup and do not understand the science
of hair then this look is definitely
something for you because you really
can't mess it up and it's so super easy
see you guys soon talk to me oh do you
hear his noises
