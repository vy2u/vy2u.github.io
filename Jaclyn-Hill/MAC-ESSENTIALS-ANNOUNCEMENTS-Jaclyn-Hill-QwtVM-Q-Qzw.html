today I'm going to be doing a mat
essentials video for you things I think
that if you're new to Mac old Mac
whatever products that I believe that
everyone should own if you are
interested in mac cosmetics you know if
you want to build on your essentials
things I really think that everyone
should own they're just great for
everyday I picked just a handful of
products that I basically whenever
someone comes into the store and has
never shopped a mat before or only owns
a couple of eyeshadows and it's just
like I don't know what to get I'm
overwhelmed these are the kind of things
I gear them towards nothing crazy
nothing for editorial or drag makeup
just simple things that you can use to
create an everyday look something like
I'm wearing today so before we get into
that I just want to make a quick few
little announcements number one I am one
of the nominees in Ryan Seacrest's
favorite YouTube makeup artist right now
um I was kind of confused about it but a
subscriber told me and then I start
getting all these comments from people
telling me that they're voting for me
and I was like what is this so I went to
Ryan Seacrest comm and I saw that he's
doing a thing right now where you vote
for your favorite YouTube makeup artist
and I am on that list and I am so
overjoyed and so excited like you have
absolutely no idea I mean if it wasn't
for you guys I would never be on this
list and I am just so thankful to all of
you like I know that there's like a fat
chance that I'm going to win because I'm
up against some girls who have tons more
of followers and subscribers than I do
but just the fact that I'm in it I just
want to say thank you to you guys like
you have no idea how much I appreciate
you I'm not gonna get weird right now
but seriously I am just words cannot
explain how much I truly love you guys
so much and I just want to thank you
because this is amazing and I will put
the link below and if you want to just
click on my name and click vote that's
all it is you can vote as many times as
you want but you know just knowing that
anyone is voting for me it's just like
oh thank you so much I just anyways okay
so moving on next thing I want to say is
that I have been getting a lot of people
asking me I'm not asking me sending me
photos of themselves of looks that
they've recreated or just pictures that
they want me to see on Instagram and a
lot of you guys have your profile set to
private so I can't see your pictures and
it's
sad because I see someone has tagged me
in something and I go to click on it and
nothing will show up it just says this
users private so kind of stinks so I
want to tell you guys if you really also
another thing is that I do get so many
like so much action on my Instagram and
so many comments and likes and stuff
like that that it's hard for me to see
everyone's so if you just start hash
tagging pictures that you want me to see
Jacqueline Hill you can also tag me in
it but if you hash tag Jacqueline Hill
I'll have a better chance of seeing it
once again if your profile is on private
I won't be able to so even if you want
to take it off private for just a few
days and that'll be guaranteed to see it
and double tap that and tell you guys
how amazing you are so that's that and
then number three is that I have been
getting so so many questions about my
personal life lately like you know why
did I get married so young when did I
get married how to meet my husband meet
how do I become a makeup artist you know
questions about my hair questions about
my house questions about just random
stuff like even things like what's your
favorite color or what's this like so
it's very hard to answer all of those
things so I'm thinking about doing maybe
a question and answer video or like a
get to know me video just basically you
guys can ask me whatever you want and I
will answer them now if you're gonna ask
me what's your home address I'm not
gonna tell you that what's your phone
number but you know if you just have any
general questions for me I don't mind if
you go a little deep you know you can
ask me whatever you want because you
know I know how to get weird but you
know I really think that that would make
it so that you guys would get to know me
a little bit more maybe you're kind of
sick of just seeing makeup tutorials and
you're like is this bitch anyways so
yeah so if you want me to do that please
let me know if you have any questions
for me go ahead and just leave them in
this video below if I get a bunch of
questions you know maybe just leave a
question for me and then like next to it
put like QA for question and answer I'll
know that means that you want me to
answer this question in an upcoming
video and then I'll make a video just
based about question and answers okay
done like that moving on so now I'm
going to get into the videos actually uh
DUP which are my favorite Mac essential
products I think everyone should own so
number one I'm going to start off with
their primer because I am NOT a huge
believer in primer my camera's dying of
course okay we're good also I don't know
why this is sitting here like it was
sitting here
doing stuff on it and then died it's
just sitting here so now I feel like
it's weird to take it out that I just
realize it's there and then like half a
video it's gone whatever anyways this is
my computer this is how I stay connected
with you so let's get started
the first thing is primer if you've
heard me speak in videos before I really
don't think primer is a very necessary
thing to you I just keep touching my
hair like I wear up so often then when
it's down I'm like ah hair my hair like
I'm so aware of it oh that's one more
thing is I will be doing a hair tutorial
all about my hair although I'm sorry my
memory card just got full so I had to go
delete things so anyways where was I I
was talking about my hair I'm gonna be
doing a video soon but I need to get it
cut in colored so bad before I try to
talk about it in any glamorous way at
all and I've had an appointment now for
a long time it's on March 12th so look
out after March 12 I'll be making a
video and I'll also be doing a really
awesome giveaway having to do with hair
I'm so excited
okay so just stay tuned anyways primer
Wow little distracted huh so the mac
cosmetics primer the natural radiance
looks like this and I think this is one
of the only primers that actually works
has salicylic acid in it which is going
to help with cell turnover I cannot
speak which is really great for oily
skin but I extremely dry and I really
feel like it has first of all it has
gold crushed pearlized pigments in it so
it really does give radiance to the skin
and I feel like it keeps my foundation
on and doesn't settle it's like little
lines on the face next on the list
is mac fix+ this is the best product in
the world this is my favorite anything
of anything in the cosmetic industry I
think this is the most amazing product
ever it's just a setting spray spray
erupt in your face okay so it's just a
spray it's gone vitamin E in it green
tea it's just it's amazing it's supposed
to revitalize the skin reduce redness
really sets the makeup so when you're
done with your foundation and powder
just spritz it it'll make everything
it'll kind of open up the pores and
allow it to grab on to everything a
little bit better it will give you a
slightly do we finish but extremely oily
people can use it and it's still not
going to make you look really oily it'll
just kind of give you a glow glow that
even oily people should have it's
amazing if you are very oily you can
also use this as your moisturizer or
your primer before you go in with your
makeup next I'm going to talk about soft
and gentle this is a highlighter from
Mac it's a mineralized skinfinish you
can see oh so pretty I think this is one
of the prettiest basics most basic
highlighters it's more of like a pinky
silver but it's got a little bit of gold
tones in there not much though but it
definitely has some gold pigments in
there um just take a synthetic brush too
like a black haired brush and it's just
meant to go on the top of the cheeks
right on those cheekbones
you can also take this down the nose if
you want to make your nose you know more
apparent and look more straight you know
whatever but this is just beautiful
beautiful highlighter I think it's
awesome it works on a huge variety of
skin tones if you are very very dark
you're going to want to go for gold
deposit which is the same thing but just
a straight bronze gold which if you're
very dark in skin tone then that'll be
your best friend sticking with the
mineralized skinfinish I would say that
for a great setting powder the
mineralized skinfinish natural is
amazing this is in shade medium right
here this has been untouched
I just got it for my kits and did not
use out my last couple of jobs but this
is amazing it's a mineralized so it's
baked there's a like a pan underneath
that it's baked on an oven before it
comes to us so fancy but you can also
use this wet you can spray your brush
with like fix+ and then go in and use it
and if you're dry it'll give you more of
like a glowy finish there is no shimmer
in this whatsoever but it's like a
velvety finish not a matte finish so
it's very sheer it does not come off
opaque at all I'll get a good amount and
you can see it like that and you can see
how sheer is so it's a beautiful setting
powder if you're in your young age you
know teens whatever fifth 14 15 16 years
old and you just want something really
nice and light and you don't want to do
foundation this is a great option put it
on with like a stiff kabuki brush very
free and then set it with a fixed plus
of course amazing okay so next for like
the under eye area I talked about all
these things all the time so Mac have
them
I'm highlighter and radiant Rose is my
favorite color
this is the pink tone I showed this in
my haul video format cosmetics I wear
this under my eyes all the time I don't
have it on today I don't think I
remember I did my makeup so fast but
this is just a beautiful highlighter if
you don't have really really intense and
dark under-eye circles or bags and you
feel like you need concealer once again
if you're younger and age this is
amazing
just swipe like two or three marks on
your eyes and just rub that in and this
will just bring a lot of light to the
eyes and a great thing about this is in
photography it does not like especially
with flash photography it doesn't give
you that white circle that some
highlighting products can tend to do so
this is amazing they also have two other
shades this is just my personal favorite
um they have a yellow one and then they
have like a darker more baiji one on the
darker one is bright forecasts yes
bright forecasts that one is beautiful
beautiful beautiful on women of color so
if you are like an NC 44 and darker or
NW 40 and darker bright forecast is
amazing light boost is more yellow I
don't like to put yellow under the eyes
I think that it kind of especially when
it's something like a cream I think it
can kind of accentuate um things you
want to hide but the yellow one is
beautiful on the cheekbones I just want
to put it directly under the eye area
that's just me just me okay
so then we'll just do this real quick my
favorite foundation by Mac which I am
NOT a huge person on Mac foundation I am
very dry though but my personal favorite
foundation is the studio sculpt by Mac
this isn't shade NC 30 it looks really
really yellow with my light but whatever
um this is a gel base formula so it's
very creamy it goes on very smooth if
you are very oily you're gonna hate this
foundation if you're really really oily
I would suggest pro longwear foundation
which again I should have grabbed that
before I can film the video but Pro
Longwear Foundation is another amazing
one so dry this one and oily I would do
pro longwear okay this is the pro
longwear concealer by Mac it goes it's
the pro longwear foundations sister and
this is just an amazing under-eye
concealer I use it all the time almost
every one of my videos unless I'm doing
like a nice natural look then all
use something just like the highlighter
I was talking about or something much
more light but the pro longwear
concealer is one of the best I
absolutely love it it's a full coverage
doesn't settle in fine lines and
wrinkles but I will say that I think
that everybody needs to set this with a
powder even though it has a technology
in it not to settle into fine lines
everything is going to settle into fine
lines if you have lines I think that
this needs to be set with a powder but
remember when you're setting a powder
under your eyes don't use SPF in it and
don't use anything thick you don't want
to use anything thicker then like the
mineralized skinfinish natural you want
it to be very sheer or if you can get
online and get your hands on the pro
sculpting and shaping powders they're
online only or Mac Pro stores those are
amazing they're meant for the under eye
area as well so they're very sheer they
bring light to the face so that's that
the next two things I haven't taken out
because I these are doubles that I need
but the eyebrow pencils my Mac these are
amazing amazing eyebrow pencils one of
my favorite there's someone in my
hallway
very very thin okay so this is how thin
it is and I love it because it's not too
creamy but it's not like chalk it's not
like like waxy but I'll show you like
how little the movements are so you can
see how you can get like really precise
like yeah like it's just so it's just a
fine point pencil that it's really easy
to get in there and just kind of mimic
the texture of hair with this because
it's not like a big fat creamy pencil
which can be you know very drag-queen
ish but if that's what you're going
after you do it
lingering is one of the best colors a
lot of people who see this especially a
color on the box they think it's going
to be too light or too red or whatever
but it's not it's the best it's the most
everyday color that I use I use this
color on I would say 75% of people and
then next I use spiked which is exact
same formula
it's just darker the box is this color
and spiked looks like this next
lingering so you can see the difference
spiked is right there in the middle much
darker I use lingering all over my brows
and then sometimes if I just feel like
whatever if I'm doing a more dramatic
eye I'll take spiked and just do the
outer tail right here just to give it a
little more definition it can make it
look a little bit more natural oh I
forgot to tell you Matt panelling Paint
Pot this is a given everyone and their
mother should own this all it is is just
a creamy eyeshadow type whatever and
it's just gonna cry in your eyes for any
look that you're going to do so this is
one of the first things you should put
on the face along with primer or
moisturizer whatever whatever you're
feeling that day and then use going with
your eyeshadow and make it so that it
lasts longer the pigment will show up
truer it'll be easier to blend it won't
crease it won't settle it's necessary
okay so then I just want to talk about
basic neutral eyeshadows I only have
five and you're probably don't know
exactly which ones I'm going to talk
about because I love these products I
think they look beautiful on literally
everyone everyone I know I get a lot of
comments from people being like I'm
african-american and when you say
everyone it doesn't apply to me but it
does apply to you because these are
colors I think look amazing on truly
everybody so number one I'm going to
size Naked Lunch hmm
what do you know naked
like this I've talked about before how I
like the shade all that glitter is
better but Naked Lunch applies to more
shades Naked Lunch looks good on
literally everyone that's why I'm
putting it in this video where all that
glitters I think you need to have a
little bit more color so you can see
it's just a nice pinky creamy Sheen
looks really pretty all over the lid
next is shroom I think this is the most
beautiful highlight color that we have
you can put this on the top of the
cheekbones I use it under my brow every
day inner part of my eye this one is
just more of a white compared to Naked
Lunch can you see that um we're swatch
sure in the world award I swear okay so
yeah you can see right there it's just
light whatever it's underneath my brow
you can't see next is texture which is a
very caramel color yes I've hit pan and
this is my second one that I've gone
through in the last couple of years it's
obviously one of my favorites it's got a
little bit of shimmer in it and it's
gold shimmer um when you try to swatch
this shade it does not show up but I
promise you it's got great pigmentation
on the lid there we go okay so that's
texture right there it's just a very mmm
it just looks like caramel I really does
like when you go to Starbucks and you
order like a camel macchiato look
caramel that they drizzle on top of your
camel macchiato it looks like that exact
color with a little bit of char but not
too much beautiful in the crease if you
guys watched my videos you know I can't
get enough Swiss chocolate I think this
is the prettiest brown shade that Mac
has it's very warm and it's right there
next to texture so this is texture and
this is Swiss chocolate beautiful I have
them both on my outer corner today with
a big fluffy brush just really lightly
blended okay which speaking a big fluffy
brush I'm not putting any brushes in
this video because I'm going to be make
doing a whole video all about brushes
and I would say about five or six days
so look out for that I'm going to
mention two blushes one with shimmer and
one with no shimmer prettiest blush with
no shimmer is Melba this is a beautiful
color blush this is like it's rosy a
little bit of peach little bit of pink a
little bit of everything you can see it
looks like right there and that's
everything I'm showing you in the camera
is pretty true to color like this
the colors are showing up on camera
pretty much exactly how it looks in
person so that is Melba right there
beautiful matte blush and then for a
blush a shimmer which again I think
looks beautiful on basically everybody
is margin by the way the reason I have
them like this is because they're in my
palettes so they're easier to travel I
don't have the open and shut cases
whatever so this is margin and I'll show
you what this looks like this has a
sheen in it oh it's so beautiful
we're not going to put this I'll put
this right below Melba okay so that's
margin right there but you can see the
sheen in it it's so beautiful this even
looks gorgeous as a highlight on really
dark women so it's gorgeous looks
beautiful on basically everybody I love
it okay so I'm last things I'm going to
talk about are cute lip products so I'm
going to just start off with lipsticks
the two most beautiful lipsticks I think
that Mac has four neutral every day
where is cream cup I talked about this
in my last video my Mac haul that was my
last video but you know I'm talking
about my Mac haul gorgeous creamy pink
very beautiful I'm not going to swatch
it i swatched it in there and then syrup
which looks like the syrup is a really
beautiful again everyday tone and looks
gorgeous on so many skin tones and it's
not really pale it's not really nude
it's just here I'll put it on for you
that'll make it easier right
oh yeah I don't like heat when I apply
lipstick you know how some girls are
like no pay three lip glosses I'm going
to say fluster rose for my absolute
favorite on absolutely everybody it's a
pink eye once again swatch this in my
Mac Hall because I absolutely love this
so it's really similar um no it's not
somewhere or anything I'm sorry I'll put
it on over top so you can see what it
looks like so once again it's like a
neutral with a little bit of mink in it
pretty color right right
I look oily yes Mac Pro Longwear lip
glass collection these are my favorite
lip products that Mac's sell my two
favorites are forever rose and
infinitely lickable which are these two
right here I've talked about them both
before the Rose one is my absolute
favorite of all time so gorgeous it
looks true to form just like this they
are extremely opaque when you put them
on they are not sheer at all they have
this little felt tip applicator and with
just one swipe you can see how pigmented
it is so it's going to show up exactly
how it looks in the bottle same with
infinitely lickable every one of them
are extremely opaque with just one swipe
you can see infinitely lickable right
underneath of it so infinitely lickable
the light pink one looks really
beautiful over cream cup and by itself
these are great because they don't need
to be layered you can just put them
straight on the lips and it looks like
you've lipstick and lip gloss on because
they're so big and they really do last a
very long time you might think they're
stinky but I've never been like a big
person who was like oh god sticky lip
gloss I don't care if my lip gloss looks
pretty and it's what I want that I don't
care I was the cutest but that's just me
um but those are absolutely amazing
they're my favorite lip products and
that makes so yeah we are all finished
up that's everything that I think that
everybody should kind of keep an eye out
for when shopping at Mac you know
starting a collection in the middle of a
collection whatever my name is open up

aware of so yeah let me know what you
think the essentials are from mac
