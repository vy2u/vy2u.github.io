guys so today I'm going to be doing a
haul video for you I have never done a
haul video before I like to watch them
I've never done one though cuz I just
it's not really been my thing and I
don't buy a whole lot but I thought that
I would do this I posted a picture of on
Instagram of some new things I purchased
for my makeup kit and I got so many
comments asking me to do a haul video
and I've received so many comments in
the past month or so asking if I would
start doing haul videos now I don't
intend on this becoming a regular basis
thing because I really want to keep my
channel down to just makeup and makeup
tutorials because that's definitely
where I come from um but this is all
makeup related and I bought all of this
for my professional freelance makeup kit
so these are things I may already own
myself but I use only on me these are
things are gonna go into my makeup bag
that I can use when I go out and do work
and as you know it takes money to make
money so whoo I'm just glad that I got
this over with spent the cash and now I
have it so how do bite the bullet so
let's start first Hill everything I'm
going to show you is from Mac I know
that I sound like a total Mac whore um
but I'm not but I do get a large
discount there so because of that I
really can buy a lot of Mac because it's
a lot easier so I'm going to start off
with the first thing that is right in
front of me I have everything like in
little groups oh by the way I'm at my
mom's house right now and that's why
this is happening I'm here because my
husband has this big drum thing coming
up and he has his drum set in the next
room and he has to practice so I'm here
and I was like I'm bar I'm filming okay
so let's start the first thing that I'm
kind of unsure about is a new matte
palette and yes I just touched it right
the first time out of the packaging it
already has fingerprints on it so I can
imagine that bothering me but will calm
down so this is really weird because
it's double sided so when you open it I
have three of my new palettes right
there and I'm sorry I'm gonna blind you
mean through my new eyeshadows right
here and this is cranberry Indian ink
and deep damson um you can see I don't
want to i don't have wand you guys you
can see my camera on there but there how
about like that you can see those colors
wait no like that so yes cranberry
Indian ink and deep damson and Indian
ikan deep Danson are
both pro colors um but back to the
palette I'm not I'm not sure about it
because like it's double-sided so you'd
like go like this and then you open up
okay see this is why I'm not I'm not so
sure and then this side is also
magnitude so you can keep like 70
eyeshadows in here which is fabulous but
I feel like if this is in my case that
they're gonna be like falling you know
what I mean like the magnets might come
loose and I can just see this maybe
being something that I'm gonna be like I
don't know but I really wanted to give a
shot I'm still gonna put some stuff in
here see how it works
yada-yada moving on I got powders once
again for my kids
everything is um I got the mineralized
skinfinish --is because these are my
favorite powders I love these two set
makeup especially when you're going to
be taking pictures because they look
beautiful on camera as opposed to the
studio fix powder can really wash you
out on camera make you look very white
and change the color of your face
opposed to your neck so I just got a
bunch of these the mineralized
skinfinish is I got them in shades
medium deep medium plus and medium so I
already have medium dark dark and like
so I got the other ones in between that
I needed and then I also got give me Sun
which is my all-time favorite bronzer I
don't think I've ever tried a bronzer
that's better than this I hope that it's
not getting washed out no it's pretty
true to the color um it has kind of a
terra cotta feel to it but it's not too
orange and it's not too Brown um but
this if you put this on a very very
light skin tone you know like an nw15
and w20 this can look like a bit much
so I would say that well in 35th nw20
can do it I think but I would definitely
be an NW 25 and up or an NC 20 and up in
Mac foundation before you get give me
some because it definitely can look kind
of on the orangie dark side if you're
extremely fair um okay moving on I got a
242 brush which is my all-time favorite
brush I know you guys have so many
questions about brushes for me and I am
going to be filming a video dedicated
all about brushes soon and what I think
are the essentials and what brands I
think are the best and how to clean them
and so on and so forth
but I will just say right now that the
Mac 242
which is this little shader brush I
think is hands down one of the best
brushes in the entire world I really
think that people overlook the brushes
that you use to apply the shadow all
over the lid but this one is like oh oh
my gosh it's it's my favorite brush ever
I've never used a brush by any company
that the bristles are like so perfectly
safe yet movable and it's so like skinny
sideways and it just packs on color like
a mofo
so yes need that and then I got which
this is kind of silly I was like oh come
on I can get that somewhere else on the
Mac I ended up getting it there just the
little scissors and I got these these
obviously in a kit you do need scissors
to cut lashes or whatever else is
happening on their faces you never know
um but I got them because they're
protective scissors like this and so I
won't be stabbing myself or a client if
I am digging through my bag because the
ones I have now are sharp and they're
like shut like I they're a weapon like I
could kill someone with them they're so
sharp and I have reached in there before
and been like oh it hurt my hands so
we're not going to go there I just got
one more smolder ichael which is a great
great eye pencil um it's just very black
black as night I use it all the time
very good for the inner rim if you are
very oily or you feel like your makeup
runs though you may not be a biggest fan
of that you would probably like graph
black buy Mac a little bit better it's
water-resistant and it's twist-up it's
not an actual pencil that sharpens like
this one also Urban Decay 24/7 um their
liners the black one is called
perversion amazing amazing it's a bit
more than a spider it's a bit more
expensive than the Mac one but it's it's
fantastic it's yes it lasts for so long
okay so next I got the prep and prime
highlighters I got all three of them and
the colors are bright forecasts radiant
rose and light boost I use radiant Rose
all the time on my under eye area
because it's a pink tone and it looks
really beautiful
you can mix in with the concealer use it
by itself put on top of the concealer
put under the concealer but it's really
gorgeous it eliminates you know like
yellowy green circles under there it'll
counteract
and this looks really nice on anybody
from like the pails that you can be to
like an NW 30 or like an NCO I was antsy
40 maybe yeah so this is beautiful for
the under eye area as for the yellow one
I like to use that to hide the face on
fair women um that one will look really
nice
I avoid yellow under the eye area I
think it emphasizes any issues that you
may have
so that's radiant Rose the one that I
use right there I'm just a pink base and
then the next one is bright forecasts
this one is gorgeous on women of color
if you are dark that is your color to
highlight absolutely amazing it's very
pinky kind of caramely gorgeous and then
light boost this one is the yellow one
that I use on the face so radiant Rose
bright for cast and light boost amazing
I cannot live without these things I
love them so much and they last forever
I just I love them love them love them
I got fix+ just another one I love mac
fix+ and you should own this no matter
what kind of skin you have oily dry if
you're oily you can use as a moisturizer
to prep the skin before you put on
makeup if you're dry you can use this to
set your makeup it'll give you kind of a
glow hydrate the makeup in the face a
lot amazing I use this to spray my
brushes and then go with eyeshadows to
get more pigment I just spray my brushes
before I use mineralize skinfinish is to
get more pigment more glow to the skin
it's just amazing this is the pro
concealer palette and corrector in shade
light so you can see these shades right
there
it comes with shades end of NC 15 w10 NC
20 MW 20 and pale yellow and a pale pink
so basically what this is it's at the
Mac stores right now they just came out
in a collection they're also at the Mac
Pro stores they are not any of the
counters though but it is a corrector
and concealer palette it is the studio
finish concealer which we have all year
round but it's just in this form so
these I do not recommend for the under
eye area I know someone left a comment
telling me they saw a senior artist
using this on that cosmetics on the
under eye area and you can put it there
by all means if you're going to do it
you have to do
- light amount I recommend using a
sponge but it will crease on you and I
mean you can ask anybody even if you
have the most beautiful under eye area
of all time it will find a way to move
around and shift increase cuz just by
the texture of it it's its thick stuff
so um when I did a workshop on
concealers up in Chicago they did make
it very clear that this is made for the
face under the eyes it's just going to
be a hot mess so I use these to correct
any redness around like the nose cheeks
any breakouts things like that you know
so that's good moving on
I got a Mac Pro lip erase lip erase lip
balm I was mercy liberates paste like
benefits the erase paste lip erase lip
balm okay I got this and this is a pro
product it's come out in a couple of
collections at Mac but is always at the
pro store which by the way I found out
that Pro products are now allowed being
sold online on that Cosmetics calm to
the open public you no longer have to be
a pro member to get them online so it's
awesome so this isn't shake dim they
have a shade pale and then they have a
shade dim I got it in dim and you can
see like if I put a lot on that it just
looks like that it's basically the exact
same color skin you can see it right
there on my hand you can barely even see
it because it's the color of skin you
can wear this by itself but what it's
made to do is to prep the lips so that
if you're putting on a lipstick let's
say a pink lipstick and you already have
like pinkness in your lips or whatever
it may be this will myou out the lip so
that whatever you put on will be true to
its color like it will not your lip
color won't change it like me for
example I have very pigmented lips
they're very pinky red so if I put on
like a sheer nude it looks like a pink
nude like you know it doesn't look new
new because my lips are so pigmented so
you know this will completely wipe out
the color of your lips so that you get
like a fresh start so then for lips I
love lips I love it it's funny that I
didn't get any blush because I'm such a
blush freaking that's the one thing I
didn't need because I'm so obsessed with
I already had too many so for the lips I
got three lip glosses and one two three
four five six lipsticks just lipsticks
that I know that looks good on everybody
I got cream puffs which I mentioned in
my January favorites
absolutely gorgeous let me do a little
swatch
I'm gonna have room for all the swatches
on here but that's what it looks like
it's a pink I had it on my lips earlier
but then I changed up when I was wearing
right before I started filming the video
and I'm actually wearing the whispers
what is this the exact same color as my
nail-polish like it's kind of creepy um
hola lilac lu la lilac hola lilac lilac
that's what I'm wearing on my lips right
now
um but yeah so cream cup looks gorgeous
on so from light to very tan cream cup
is beautiful I've even had some women of
color come in and put cream Club cream
Club cream cup on and a rocket so
there's that and then I got let's see
it's the same one pink Nouveau which is
just a great great basic pink I think
this is like the most perfect pink that
just looks good on everyone it's just a
true pink can you see that yeah there we
go
it's just it's a good pink like it's
it's a real pink it's not purple it's
not fuchsia it's just pink I love it and
then I got did I seriously get 2 cream
cups I had 2 cream cups I can't talk
about this okay well whatever it'll be
used ok then I got blankety which is
another amazing nude I got a lot of
nudes because that's basically what
everybody wants
so blankety has like um it has more
Brown on it like creme Cup is right next
to one you can't really even see it but
um blankety has more Brown in it it's
good for like a skin tones like maybe
around me or a tad bit darker but it's a
great great color if you are very fair
blanket you can look kind of muddy on
the lips you need to go over it with a
light gloss I got syrup
another amazing nudey pink but I really
like this one because this looks good on
everyone I'm talking everyone this looks
fun everyone and it's that one right
down there so as you can see it's more
muted than the rest I know they're all
really similar and it's kind of like why
didn't you get any that are like really
different but I just didn't because
everybody wants these kind of colors and
I've worked a Mac for a long time and I
just realized this is what people want
they want these new lips you know with
just a little bit of pink in it
that's what I got and then the last one
right here is fleshpot which is a MacPro
lipstick it comes out sometimes in
limited collections I don't know if the
MAC store made it permanent I know the
counters haven't the Mac store might
have no and only get it um but yes it is
the color of flash that's why it's
called flash pot it's very nude very
pale pink undertone gorgeous okay and
then I got three lip glosses
I got see-through which is once again
very very popular one see-through is
just a completely see-through type gloss
it's very very pale I will show it to
you right here that's it right there it
looks really nice on a lot of skin tone
so just once again why I got it for my
makeup kits beautiful it looks really
good over pinks it really just mutes
everything down it's a great color and
then I got an inset which I'm I
personally am NOT crazy about nymphet I
know some diehard nymphet fans me not so
much but I bought it because this is not
for me this is for other people and I'm
here to give you what you want but it
looks very Goldy so it's this one right
there
so it's pink with a very like iridescent
gold I mean like it kind of looks like a
frost it kind of looks like a frosty
lipstick on the lips but people are
crazy for it so you know it's a good
color to have and then my last but not
least which is actually my favorite lip
gloss right now is called fluster rose
it's a luster glass from map which means
it's a little bit more sheer and I had
an applicator that looks like this as
opposed to like the little thumb so I'll
put this right here oh I love it I love
this I love it over blankety and creme
Cup because it's such a pretty pink
I just love it's got some shimmer in it
not too much not too opaque just sheer
enough oh it's gorgeous so yeah you can
see my hands are just adorbs so yeah I
think that's it I did get brush cleaner
you guys don't care about that though
I'm sure
I'll talk more about brush cleaner
brushes in my next video so yeah that is
my entire haul and maybe I gave you guys
some tips of like good you know neutral
colors that a lot of people like and
yeah I'll see my next video bye guys
