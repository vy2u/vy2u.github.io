talking to hear myself speak I've got a
lot of requests for a Mac start okay and
I will just kind of in live in on them
but I do realize it is important because
map can be very overwhelming when you
walk in there and if you're not educated
on the products it's like oh my god
where do I start
so I'm going to just kind of help break
it down for you I'm going to stick to
basic products I'm not gonna branch out
and you know show you all these
different colors and things because I
want to try to simplify this for you as
much as possible we'll see if this turns
into a 20 minute video please your God
so before I start I just want to mention
really quick that we just came out with
our Holiday Collection and it is awesome
like normally our holiday collections
I'm not that impressed by it's kind of
like the same mumble jumble like
whatever you know I'm honest with you
like the max heart and tail collection
two years ago I was just kind of like
like the tartan and whatever it was just
like this kind of I don't know but this
year I love the packaging and I love the
product so I just want to mention to you
guys really quick because these are
really beautiful products and I just
want to show them to you so that you can
get them before they leave for all those
people out there who are always
complimenting like my highlighted cheeks
and interested in highlights this came
out and it's been out before it's the
extra dimension skin finish and it is a
cream and it comes in two different
colors this is whisper of guilt and it
also comes
oh hey there I am it also comes in one
called superb but I like this one the
best because it's gold whisper I mean
yeah superb is kind of like a like a
grayish tone but this is very look out
during my hand is this is this is very
gold I'm so mature so you can see the
highlight that that gives it is just it
is so pretty it still got a lot of
stores it's still online I know my
counter is getting it back in so that's
gorgeous also these just came out yes
during the eighth so two days ago and
the packaging is adorable
it's all different colors this is just
this lip gloss set and these little
glasses are amazing this year they're
amazing but this is my favorite one I
bought it because I was just so obsessed
and it's just Purple's I've got this
really dark sparkly purple on right here
I've got that on my lips
along with random other stuff I'm
wearing an eyeliner on my lips right now
I'm not gonna lie to you like okay
anyways back to being simplistic um yes
Purple's these are so gorgeous they're
unlike any colors that we sell that's
why I bought them because they're so
individual and unique and they're so
creamy and they're not sticky I'm just
in love with them so I talked about
throw those things out there for you
guys because they're out right now and
because they're limited edition I would
recommend anybody who is into mac to
pick these products up because they're
we don't sell anything like them the
other times of the year and they're
gorgeous
anyways now we're going to just jump
into the Mac starter kit I'm going to
try to talk quickly not saying Lee and
get through this for you guys so that
maybe can help you in a little bit the
first part I want to mention is what I
think is Mac's best product overall I
think it's very individual unique and
that is fixed plus it is the most
versatile product that we sell hands
down it can be used for so many things
first of all it is a vitamin infused
water okay
like who's texting me right now don't
you know I'm making a video and it's a
hydrating mist and basically what it is
is a vitamin a mineral infused water it
has green tea in it has cucumber in it
vitamin E wait don't you say vitamin E
anyways it's going to help reduce
redness and replenish the skin you can
use it before you put on your makeup
which is that what I do i spritz my face
and then I go on with my foundation and
then when my face is complete on I
spritz it again to set it to help like
sandwich it together in hydration and if
you're oily you can do the same thing it
gives a really beautiful glow to the
skin when you're done and it's just I
love it you can also what your brush
with it when you're going in with
pigments or eyeshadows and it's going to
get like a metallic more like amazing
shiny finish okay so after that I have
Foundation and everybody is going to
need a good foundation and there's a lot
of foundations at Mac cells but
I'm just going to show you my personal
favourites the first one is the studio
sculpt mine's like this is one of mine
and it's like completely gone
anyways Studio sculpt is a gel based
foundation so it's really really great
for people mmm I'm joking it's really
great for people who have dry skin it's
really hydrating it's also long wearing
and water-resistant it goes on really
really smooth um I wouldn't recommend
this anybody who's super oily but if you
are you just have to make sure you set
it with a powder um I have two more
foundations the pro longwear foundation
is amazing on every single skin if
someone's like I don't know I just don't
like foundation and you know I'm super
oily around this and I'm dad and my
skin's just crazy I give them Pro
Longwear because everybody is happy with
it um other than the fact that you do
feel it on your skin rather heavily it's
amazing it doesn't look heavy it just
it's sticky because it lasts for so long
I think it lasts they say for up to 12
hours I don't know I love this
foundation it gives you like a natural
matte finish and it doesn't need to be
set with powder I don't think and
doesn't need a primer that's pretty
sweet I don't normally use primers um
the last one is the mineralized
foundation this once again is going to
be for people who are more on the dry
side you can also use if your
combination though and this one is super
creamy I mix this in Studio sculpt
together that's what I've been doing
recently because I was so dry and I use
it with the fix plus on my brush and I'm
just like and it's a match made in
heaven for me but the great thing about
max minner we're gonna move on to
concealer and for the under-eye
concealer the only one I put on anybody
is the pro longwear concealer this um
it's just perfect it's a matte it's a
semi matte finish so it's like a natural
finish and gives full coverage which is
really great because if you have a lot
to cover you can but if you don't need
that much coverage you can blend it out
with a brush or your fingers and it's
just it's a semi matte so it's not going
to be like powdery
but it's not going to be like wet and
like Dewey in like because we don't want
wetness in our eyes but the great thing
about this is that it lasts all day long
and it has the technology in its formula
to not settle on any fine lines and
wrinkles which I thought sounded like a
lie when I first heard about it but it's
true ever I used to have such bad issues
with my concealer the selects cover-up
okay not even find one okay here's like
an old one a slight cover-up I used to
have a horrible issue with these
settling and my little lines I made my
eyes but this one does not do that and I
will love this until the day I die so
yes Pro Longwear concealer for life
amazing
unless we're really dry I would set your
face to the powder especially in a
t-zone area you know it will give you a
little more coverage but I would go in
with the mineralized skinfinish but yes
this is my favorite all-over powder that
Mac sells it has such a gorgeous finish
it's is technically a matte finish but
once again it's a natural matte finish
so it has it a little bit of a glow to
it like a tiny bit of Sheen but not
something that like oily people are like
oh no that makes me look oily it's it's
very subtle and it just looks very
natural it looks like skin it's
beautiful also you know for younger
girls who are going to Mac and looking
for just like their first foundation in
their first cover-up I would go with
this because it's so sheer if you put it
on with like a small kabuki brush like
this and buff it on the skin it's so
gorgeous it looks airbrushed okay now
the last thing for the face our blushes
I only picked out two because I think
that these look good on every single
person I learned this from a makeup
artist that I love and respect very much
and he told me that if anybody has ever
confused or you're feeling stressed out
about all the millions of blushes that
there are in the world that one of these
two will look good on depending your
skin tone and they are both once again
the mineralized collection but Mac just
has a great mineralized collection I
didn't think about how I was pulling on
these mineralized shades but apparently
I really like it so um yes these blushes
this is dainty and this is warm soul so
dainty is more of a pink as you can see
but it's not a bright crazy pink
Hale nice gentle pink and it's almost
got like a touch of coral in it but not
really
it looks more coral on the camera I
think that doesn't person but this looks
really good on fair ladies you know like
in NWS neutral warms who have more like
pinky undertones but then the more cool
people who are more yellow and olive
warm soul is just gorgeous it's got like
this Goldy bronze baguette it's like a I
want to say ma vie it's just gorgeous I
can you try to swatch it ok these
swatches are not working ok and then
next for I so you're going to need to
start off with a base so the best base
that we have is the painterly paint-pot
it's the most common color that looks
good on every single skin tone if you're
golden or pink tones this it just it
works on everybody if you're super
yellow soft ochre is yellow and it's the
same thing so the Paint Pots are really
great bases and you need to use a primer
on your eyes before you go on I shadow
or you're just going to waste your
eyeshadow you're barely going to get any
of the color and if you do get the color
to get on your lids they're not going to
stay there for long it's going to follow
it off so then next buddy
shadows after you've got your primer on
the best all-over shade I can suggest is
Naked Lunch this is on my eyes right now
it's on the inner corners it's that
light like champagne a pale color and
then this just it looks good on
everybody it really does and then
everybody needs a good blending color
for their crease so you're either going
to like one or two shapes I Herson
aliyou zon basically every single person
soft brown I use this in every single
video it is just exactly what it's
called it is a soft brown it's not
really warm but it's not really cool
it's right in between I would say it's
got a little bit more warmth than
coolness but that's my next shade is 4
so soft brown in the crease I mean like
honestly I think that you can just do
Naked Lunch all over the lids soft brown
in the crease just with a big fluffy
brush and mascara and this is basic as
you can get and I love them this is
totally beaten up it's like I'm use it
every single day of my life because I
use it to fill my eyebrows but this
color is cork so I'm sorry
it's completely running out and I really
need to buy a new one but this is really
nice if you do not look good in warm
tones at all like if you just yuck you
can't even do soft brown because it's
too warm for you cork is a great
alternative but I have people who are
really pink and tones I use cork and
soft brown together because it will give
like a semi warm semi cool okay and then
I've got three more eyeshadows texture
which has a shimmer in it this is so
pretty just all over the lid I've used
this in my videos I've used all these in
my videos because there are such great
colors so this is texture right there on
my hand it's really pretty all over the
lid you can do like some thick black
liner and make it look smoky or you can
just put it in the crease with the other
colors I've mentioned I have it on my
eyes today and there somewhere with many
other colors and then Swiss chocolate
which again I've used all these in my
videos because there's such great colors
I use them all the time so Swiss
chocolate is like a warm red um if your
cool tone you don't want a warm red
espresso is a great option and I do not
have espresso I don't know what happened
to it I've actually lost a couple of
things
so yes Swiss chocolate is a beautiful
beautiful color it works on almost every
skin tone and then last but not least a
good matte black this is carbon it's the
best matte black I think I've ever used
in my life when it comes to cosmetics
but shroom is the best under the brow
highlight for every skin tone it's right
there and it looks like bangin but I
have it underneath my brow and I use
that every single day now for eyeliner I
would suggest Mac's smolder it's the
Kohl pencil it looks like this mine's
really worn down and like everything's
come off it is black as black um black
like I said it is black and it is creamy
it is extremely creamy um I put this on
the top lid on almost everyone I do
makeup on and I take a brush that looks
like this and I smudge it out with
carbon
with the matte black so this all over
the top of the lid and then I dip this
in here like this and then I just smudge
it out with this brush right here and
then for lipsticks I've got a few I'm
going to start with I've got five and
they're in different categories so my
favorite nude from Mac is Japanese
sequel it looks like this I'm gonna have
to start watching on my other hand which
is like awkward because I'm like it's
impossible for me to use my left hand so
right there is Japanese sequel so as you
can see it's new but I'm just like when
I do nude lips I don't want my nips to
be like whiteout like some girls it's
like foundation all over the lips and
then like clear gloss and that's just
that's not my thing I like my lips to be
like on the nude side but still have a
little bit of color
I don't want them to be like washed out
because it's just like awkward um I just
on me but Japanese sequel I love it's
not like too peachy it's not too Brown
and it's not too nude it's just they
just recently came out this and when I
saw I was like thank God they finally
did it right because there's other
shades just like there's always
something a little wrong with it but
that's my favorite so the next for a
pink nude lip my melted so it's like
gross but this is creme Cup and this is
a gorgeous like all-over pink color but
it's not like pink pink it's like a
light baby pink but yet it's not like
purple pink
it's just I'm just like going on and on
my description I'll show you it looks
like there is creme Cup it's nice and
basic looks really good on almost all
skin tones and if you want to you know
modify the color you can add a gloss to
it lighter or darker so I really like
that
then for my favorite pink bright pink
pink Nouveau is my favorite and this is
just a true really fun pink it's not too
purple it's not too blue it's just it's
a great pink it's not peachy it's not a
red pink it's just it's a true awesome
pink so that's that one and then for my
favorites I don't know I have four
colors not five and then for my favorite
red
it's Viva Glam one and it looks like
this and it's just a true red this one
it has been out since 1994 and it was
the first Viva Glam to ever come out yes
I also wanted to tell you guys a lot of
you cuz I I just expect you to know and
it's silly of me
but the reason I'm showing you these
little round um i shadows like this that
are magnetic is because I have the
pallets
and the counters don't sell them the
counters you can only get them like this
in the pots so if you go to Nordstrom or
Dillard's or Macy's or whatever Neiman's
it's going to come in a pot like this
but if you go to the store you can buy
two pallets and they look like this you
can get four or you can get fifteen and
I have a bunch of 15s but this is just a
four for example and you can make your
own palette and you buy this palette MD
and then you pick out whatever
foreshadows you want and they'll pop
them in there for you so that you can
have four shadows like this and just
throw it in your purse or something so
you have to have four pots and mess with
them so yeah that's just that's why I
have the magnetics and not the pots that
I'm showing you guys because I know it's
probably like why she's showing these
tiny bowl things so yeah this is a great
alternative and it saves you a lot of
money overall if you do it like this so
that's it that's all I've got for you as
far as the Mac starter kit and I know I
didn't go into detail with like
highlighting and contouring and you know
fun stuff like that but I just wanted to
keep it simple to not stress you guys
out so you can see you know just how to
keep it basic and easy you know things
that you'll need every single day so
throw on your makeup in ten minutes and
go on with your life um so yeah
hopefully this helped and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
