my March favorites I cannot believe that
is going to literally be April tomorrow
that is so crazy and I will again
speaking of April I just want to say
again if you have not heard or seen me
post it yet I will be at IMATS in New
York City on the 12th of April I am so
excited to go to New York City you have
no idea I've never been to New York in
my life I mean I've driven through it
twice but I've never actually gotten to
stop in the city and actually have fun
so I am so excited to see New York for
my first time I cannot wait and I will
be at the Sigma Beauty booth on Saturday
the 12th from 2:00 to 4:00 and I still
am not sure about Sunday if I am there
on Sunday I would be by myself running
around for like an hour like a chicken
with my head cut off and then I will
have to leave I'm not positive about
Sunday though I will keep you updated
every step of the way follow me on
Twitter if you are curious as to where
my whereabouts are during IMATS because
that's where I will be posting things
letting you know okay let's get into the
tutorial tutorial favorites whoa so I
want to first talk about two lip
products I have been obsessed with this
month and the first one is a YSL
lipstick I know it is on the pricey end
but this lipstick formula is one of my
favorites next to a matte cosmetics
lipsticks formula I just absolutely love
it in the packaging like it sells itself
hello look at this packaging this right
here is the Rouge deluxe and number 15
and it is the most perfect beautiful
coral I just love these lipsticks
because they have so much product in
them they are so creamy they feel almost
like a moisturizing gloss and they don't
give you any weird white line they smell
nice and they're so insanely creamy like
no lipstick in the world feels like
these so it is just that perfect
beautiful coral I have been wearing it
all month long I absolutely love it
these second products is a matte lip
gloss I did use in one of my recent
tutorials it is the new mineralized lip
gloss that they came out with which I
love this whole line I love the way they
feel I'm just a mineralized girl I've
always always been a fan of
mineralize line and this is called be
nice is it right yeah be nice it is just
so pretty they have such great pigments
they have a beautiful Sheen but they
don't have any sparkle or glitter in
them which I'm a fan of in everything
I'm a fan of eyeshadows blushes
lipsticks and glosses that have that
Sheen effect without glitter or any
sparkle so absolutely beautiful they're
very similar in color obviously this is
just a gloss I just love these
mineralized glosses again they're so
buttery and creamy I absolutely love
them this is a joke
I literally have sweat in my hair
another lip product that I have been
obsessed another lip product that I have
been obsessed with this entire month is
the bite beauty of ghave lip mask if you
guys have not heard of bite Beauty
they're starting to finally get some
recognition they are a really awesome
brand they're known for all their
amazing lip products and lipsticks and
they're really really great I love the
brand the packaging is just kind of on
the blase side so it's not something
that when you see it you're like oh yay
what's this it doesn't really attract
attention but what's inside the
packaging is pretty much always good so
this is the agave lip mask it came out
in the middle to end of February I
believe and I kept forgetting about it
every single time I went to Sephora and
then I finally picked it up and as you
can see like just holding it up like the
it's like oozing out right now really
that looks absolutely disgusting oh
we're gonna put that down anyways it
isn't very thick and very creamy and
it's called a lit match but it's a leave
on lip treatment so it's not something
you're going to put on a wipe off like
you do with the face mask you put it on
and you leave it on I have been using
this now for a few weeks I use it every
single night I go to bed and I cannot
even tell you how much it has changed
the dryness of my lips I just suffer
with very chapped dry lips I always have
this has to be the best lip moisturizer
I've ever used in my life when I wake up
in the morning I can still feel it on my
lips it just penetrates so deeply and
since it has a ghave nectar in it it's
just so sweet and it smells so good
I loved it worth every penny Oh so what
I'm still gonna get a sweat - some
sweating so bad oh so you guys know that
I am such a fan of false lashes and
especially mink lashes as long as no
minks are being hurt in the process
absolutely nothing compares to a good
set of mink lashes absolutely nothing
they are the very best they're beautiful
they last the longest they they are just
absolutely amazing so I had been using
velour lashes for I think it's been like
a year and a half to two years almost at
this point they are one of my favorite
brands hands down I just recently
started using these for some reason I've
never used them before and they are
called the wispy sweet nothings and they
are absolutely gorgeous I use them in I
believe my last tutorial maybe in two
tutorials I'm not positive
they are so ideal for any bride they are
absolutely beautiful they are so fluffy
so wispy they're natural and a dramatic
way so if you're looking for something
really dramatic this is not going to fit
your need and if you're looking for
something really subtle and really
natural this won't fit your need eatle
either Neil what this is like a medium
length lash they are just perfect there
are my favorite lashes of all life right
now I seriously want like 40 pairs so I
can wear them every single day forever
they're absolutely gorgeous so recently
I have been doing a lot of bronzing as
opposed to contouring because I have
just been really getting into the spring
and summer trends I know I'm a little
premature but whatever and I really
really like to bronze over stripped
harsh contours in a spring and summer
it's just softer it's more feminine and
I just prefer it so I have been using
the studio care blend pressed powder in
a shade dark for my bronzing the past
couple of weeks and if you've watched my
older videos I used to use this same
product back in the day to bronze as
well this is one of my favorite powders
just in general when I was freelancing
all the time this and Mac mineralize
skinfinish were my go-to powders I would
put on pretty much everyone to lightly
set the foundation or do foundation for
someone who is maybe 15 16 years old I
was working with the company when these
powders came out and so I had to go
through this extensive training
and learn all about the care blend
powders and immediately fell in love
with them Mac made these powders to
mimic your skin so it's a velvety match
like formula so it's not actually like
the chalkboard mattes so it really looks
like skin again it really does feel and
look velvety it's just beautiful and
that's what I do a lot of times when I
fall in love with a powder I'll just get
it in a dark shade and use it as a
bronzer so it is what I'm using right
now on my face to bronze I just
absolutely love it so that is Mac Studio
care blend pressed powder in the shade
dark this is another oldie but a
rediscovered goodie and I have used this
in a tutorial before and this is the Mac
tan pigment I absolutely love Mac
pigments well I like a lot of different
peoples pigments but it's just a
beautiful beautiful color I do have it a
little bit on my eyes too Dave
every single summer I feel I go back to
this map tan because it's just such a
perfect color for spring and summer it's
so gorgeous it really truly it looks
good on every skin tone I have used this
pigment on extremely extremely dark skin
and it's beautiful it gives everyone a
glow very fair girls it will give you a
more deep warm glow very very dark women
it'll give you a more light heavenly
glow it is absolute gorgeous sorry I'm
like sucking and giving you guys
swatches today this is the Mac tan
pigment and then this is the care blend
powder and dark anastasia beverly hills
came out with concealers this month she
is known for her brow products so I was
like what concealers but I absolutely
love them took me a while to really find
what shade I was going with and I am
currently using 1.5 now I have not worn
this underneath my eye area for a full
day of wear of a see if this creases or
not I've worn it for about an hour
before going to bed just to see and it
didn't crease in that moment but I
haven't actually using this as a
foundation I have been mixing it in with
other foundations because I just love
the formula so much it's like it's kind
of hard to explain I'm not here and
you'll see I'm like holding up in the
camera it's kind of
we if that makes sense but in all the
right ways it's very very rich and it's
nice and thick which is why I'm not sure
how it's gonna work on my under eye area
but I have been loving this formula to
sculpt out my brows since she is known
for her brows I was like I wonder if she
came up with this idea for sculpting
brows I'm not sure but I just love love
love this concealer for sculpting out my
brows I've been using it every single
day it just blends so easy you bet use
the tiniest amount like seriously this
pot I feel like it's going to last me
two years it just goes so far you can
see right there it looks like it's been
touched a couple of times and I have
used this color probably like eight
times already so it really the tiniest
bit goes the longest way after years of
wanting this product I finally went out
the beginning of this month and bought
it and that is the sole a tan
de Chanel and this is a sheer liquid
illuminizer
it is absolutely gorgeous this is a
product that is totally made for the
summertime it is a nice bronze color
it's got a little bit of pink and gold
undertones in it and I have been mixing
this in with my foundation when I apply
it just a little bit sometimes I'll do
it on the entire foundation on the face
other times I'll just mix it in on my
cheek area it is just so beautiful you
can put this on top of foundation I
personally think it goes on much
prettier and more natural when it is
mixed in another Chanel product and that
is the lift Lumiere by Chanel this is a
firming and smoothing sunscreen fluid
makeup which I was not expecting to like
and I actually went there for a
different foundation and the woman
accidentally gave me this one instead
and I didn't notice until I had used it
like twice and I was like oh well
whatever I actually really liked it so
it is a really nice beautiful medium
coverage it gives a nice glow nothing -
glowy or too over-the-top but it's just
it's very beautiful another foundation
and this is buxom show some skin
weightless foundation this almost feels
like a tinted moisturizer to me it is so
sheer but it is absolutely beautiful it
is a
perfect foundation for either a young
girl or anyone in the spring and
summertime when you just want to enhance
what is already happening on your skin
it is just so gorgeous now this does
have an SPF 30 which I don't mind at all
because I can barely smell it at all if
like I really can't smell it at all I
warn it's a couple times this past month
just going to the park going on walks
things like that when I'm outside it's
not creasing but yeah it looks super
glowy you guys know how much I love
looking glowy and dewy and hydrated it
is just absolutely beautiful again it is
very sheer it would be overreaching by
saying that it's a medium coverage it is
definitely a sheer coverage but it is
buildable and it is beautiful too more
makeup products and the first one is the
Make Up For Ever HD concealer that's
literally all it says it doesn't say
like a specific name the only thing I'm
kind of like about is this applicator on
top it's like this rubbery jell-o II
applicator and every time I twist it up
like the first layer is like a little
chunky from like the dry concealer I'm
not selling this thing to you am i but
it really is beautiful once you get on
the skin and dispense it out and work
with it it really is beautiful it's more
of a medium coverage concealer I would
not call a full if you go overboard on
application it will crease whenever I
get a new products foundation concealer
whatever I try it in all different ways
putting a light amount on a medium
amount and then an overboard amount just
to see how the product wears this is one
of those products that if you go
overboard it will crease 100% but if you
use the right amount of it very
beautiful it did not crease on me
whatsoever and I feel like every
concealer and the world creases on me
this is one of them that didn't so I
really have been liking this this month
especially on one of those days where
I'm not wearing a ton of makeup and I
don't feel like I need full coverage
happening last makeup product is the Mac
extended play gigablack lash I mentioned
in one of my videos I would say three
videos ago that I needed a new mascara
for my lower lashes and I forgot that I
had this little baby in my mascara
drawer that's the thing I have so many
things that have never been open from
Mac from working there
and this one is just the perfect perfect
mascara for your lower lash line it just
separates and makes them so
individualized it lengthens them it's
just absolutely perfect so I have been
using this for three weeks straight on
my lower lashes only I love it I have
nothing nothing bad to say about this I
did try the Clinique lower lash mascara
because it was recommended by tons of
you and it just didn't hold a candle to
this one I really really like this one
I just want to quickly mention the nail
color that I am wearing because I was
wearing a couple weeks ago in one of my
videos and so many of you were asking
about it and I did link it in the bottom
of that video and tons of you told me
that you wouldn't vote it but it is the
obsessive compulsive cosmetics nail
polish in cool boy I love love love
OCC's nail polishes you get so much in
there for the price it's so big and the
applicator is beautiful it stays on it
doesn't ship superfast it's it's just
it's great I this is like my favorite
nail polish right now not just this
color but all of OCC's polishes in
general I love the way they apply I have
a few things in skincare that I want to
mention really quickly and the first one
is the lush dirty spring wash shower gel
I know that sounds weird but it is the
most amazing and vigor rating body wash
it has a nice like spearmint oh it
smells so refreshing it is disgusting it
says don't be dirty get fresh with this
tingly and extremely minty shower gel so
I was kind of nervous about trying it
because I don't like shower gels that
are minty and truly tingly like I've
tried some that you're like you get cold
all the sudden and you're like oh my god
it's just so early men see what have I
done like I don't want to do this
anymore
this is not like that I don't feel that
tingle sensation that they refer to
I feel a nice cooling like fresh scent
and it's just yeah perfect I absolutely
love it I've been using it for two weeks
straight it is by far my favorite shush
shower gel at the moment learn a doc I
have a new favorite exfoliator which is
a very very big deal because I am crazy
crazy crazy picky when it comes to
exfoliator especially when I
to spend more than $10 in my bag of
sugar it is a big deal to buy an
exfoliator to me and it is the Bliss
micro magic it says it is a spa power
micro micro dermabrasion treatment this
is absolutely amazing it is so finely
milled it the beads and it are so tiny
it just gets off every piece of dead dry
skin beget it is made for sensitive skin
and it doesn't make my skin beet red it
doesn't hurt it in any way it doesn't
scratch it because sometimes I have
tried like microdermabrasion treatments
that are in a bottle that you can
purchase and it makes my skin so red
that it hurts for hours even when I'm
doing it gently this will was formulated
for sensitive skin and it is absolutely
amazing I use it two to three times a
week I believe is what it says on the
bottle and that's what I do because I
always exfoliate as often as I can I
know so many of you have asked if using
your Clarisonic can replace exfoliating
and no no no it cannot you still need to
be exfoliating at least once a week just
to really help get off that layer of
dead skin that will naturally shut on
its own but just helping it will really
make your products go deeper and
penetrate lower into the skin surface
and then of course make your makeup
apply much prettier so I've been
obsessed with it I highly recommend it
to anyone who is unhappy with their
current exfoliator this next brand my
sister actually introduced me to about
six to eight months ago she is an
aesthetician so she's really good with
skincare she does have a blog I will
link it down below for those of you who
are interested and it is the brand first
aid beauty if you guys have not heard
about this brand get to know them
they're absolutely amazing and they are
all hypoallergenic allergy tested
dermatologist approved made for
sensitive skin fragrance free mineral
oil free parabens free all-natural like
literally it is just the easiest
skincare line and not to mention it is
very budget friendly you can get like an
entire routine from beginning to end
from this brand they have everything you
could possibly need for such a
reasonable price and I own pretty much
their entire line because I just
gathered it all over the past six months
or so and I really really
love their face lotion and this is the
daily face cream it says it's
lightweight oil-free and it is 6-8 for
sensitive skin so I have been using this
all month long because recently my skin
has been developing oil Oh clouds
literally PARP heavens open I am happy
at age 23 God has given me a little bit
of oil in my skin it's the good life
welcome I am super excited about it but
at the same time like throughout the day
I'm kind of like ok what's happening in
this t-zone area I'm getting a little
bit of oil and my skin is kind of
reacting differently it happens in your
20s
so I've heard so I am super super in
love with this face lotion because it
hydrates but yet you don't feel it on
the skin you put it on you rub it in
within 30 seconds it's like you have
nothing on your skin whatsoever but yet
you're not dry so this is the first a
daily face cream I'm having trouble
talking can you tell I'm like I'm so hot
I think I'm going to like another line I
pretty much just love in general and
have tons of is the hola Henrickson line
and this is the truth serum collagen
booster it is for all skin types and it
is anti-aging I absolutely love this I
love vitamin C vitamin C really helps to
brighten and tighten and it can also
help with texture I have been using this
for about a month and a half and I just
absolutely love it it's supposed to help
with smoothing anti aging I think I said
already whatever when I first put it on
I was like this kind of stings but in a
good way but this thing only lasted like
10-15 seconds and then it went away
which is okay and that's normal if you
ever put anything on your skin and it
seems or more burnt and it lasts for
longer than just a few seconds that's
not normal
wash it off but especially with vitamin
C and if you have a high concentrate
vitamin C it's okay to sting a little
bit kind of like if you squeeze an
orange in your eye it's gonna sting a
little bit but I have really been loving
this serums are so so so important in
your skincare routine I would say it's
one of the most important things in your
skincare routine of course washing your
face but last product I want to talk
about is by dr. Dennis gross
which again I feel like I've said this
for every single products I love a
doctor Dennis Gross I own many things by
him he's great and he just came out I
think like a week or two ago with these
clinical concentrate boosters and you
get all three of them and this box right
here and what it is is you can customize
and make your own formula that really
works for your skin so one of them is
hydrating one of them is purifying and
one of them is for radiance and it shows
you here on the box because at first I
was like what it shows you here on the
box like you can put the orange one here
the green one here for oil control the
hydration on the cheeks whatever you
want
you don't have to follow what the box
says you can make your own little
cocktail you can use one you can use
both you can use all however you want I
just really really like them some of
them are super watery like they
literally just feel like nothing in your
hands and other of them are the other
one this one is super creamy so again
these are just concentrates you can use
this with a serum I sometimes mix it
with my serum or you can use it without
whatever you prefer I just really like
these they're nice and sensitive even
though they're made by dr. Dennis gross
which a lot of times he has a lot more
stronger like clinical stuff but they
are really great I have been loving them
so my skin has been going through some
changes recently so I've been really
getting into different skincare than I
have in the past which I kind of like
because I feel like my brain is maxed
out as far as knowing about skincare for
dry skin because it's what I've always
had so now that my skin is actually
producing some oil I'm starting to get
in a skincare that's for more
combination skin and oily skin so I kind
of like that because I get to learn more
because my skin is changing so I know
I'm such a nerd when it comes to skin
care anyways so that wraps up my entire
March favorites I really hope that you
enjoy everything for those of you going
to IMAX in New York City I cannot wait
to see you there I am so so so excited
anytime I do a meet-and-greet or IMAX or
anything and get to hug you guys and
talk to you guys it's just like honestly
the best moment of my entire life I'm
always so nervous at first and I look
alright I'm so excited oh my god and
then once I actually see you guys I'm
like oh there
so yes I can't wait to meet those of you
who are coming for those of you who
aren't as always I really do hope that I
get the chance to meet you one day and
give you a big hug and thank you for
watching my videos and supporting me so
I hope you enjoy I love you all so much
and I'll be seeing you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
