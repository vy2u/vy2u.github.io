going to be doing my March favorites I
have gotten so many requests for this
video I know you guys love monthly
favorite videos as do I they're my
favorite videos to watch you're on
YouTube I love seeing what people have
been using and what's been really
working for them that gives me ideas of
what I can go by and will work for me so
yeah let's just get into it I don't want
this to be very long sorry my phone is
going on okay so number one I'm going to
start off with a very big deal for me
because I have a new foundation that I'm
obsessed with and for me
foundation finding one that works for my
skin like truly works is like finding
the perfect pair of jeans it basically
doesn't happen you guys know that I love
my L'Oreal Lumi True Match I still do I
love it so much but it's basically
completely empty so I figured why not
try something else now I've got samples
and samples of this foundation I finally
went out and bought it and it's the
Laura Mercier silk creme foundation let
me see that one more time Laura Mercier
silk creme foundation I love this
foundation now it is a fairly small
bottle and the packaging sucks that's
okay this foundation is so amazing like
it literally you need a pea-sized drop
and it covers your entire face I use my
Sigma f80 synthetic kabuki brush to
apply it and I love it I'm wearing it
today I've been wearing it everyday for
about a month now it really works well
with my dry skin but it's not really
it's not like a dewy dewy finish it's
not really a satin finish it's like I
would say it's a would I would call it a
natural satin finish it looks really
glowy but it's not like wet and dewy I
think if you're oily you could use this
as long as you're setting with a powder
it definitely needs to be set with a
powder um since I'm dry I don't set it
with a powder if I do I just do it right
here just to kind of set it so nothing
moves but it's an amazing foundation I'm
in the color sand beige and I'll rear
its is on the back
the ultimate and flawless natural
coverage silk cream foundation is a
beautiful light diffusing formula
offering advanced light reflecting
properties which cause fine lines and
wrinkles to optically vanish Laura
Mercier created an innovative foundation
that delivers flawless buildable
coverage and a long wearing rich
hydrating base boom amazing alright next
I'm going to talk about skincare
products if you guys know and you watch
my channel you know that I love Mario
Badescu products I think they're
absolutely amazing for the most part the
completely natural organic great
ingredients beautiful products so I'm
going to start off by the eye cream this
is for all skin types and it is the seer
mind herbal eye cream comes in a little
jar that looks like this it's just like
a light beige e sea foaming green you
can't really see it though in this
lighting there you go
I've had this jar for about four months
I would say and I'm not even half gone
not even half done with it like
seriously it's all push-up on the side
right now but if it was flat it would
not even be half gone maybe a quarter
and I use this stuff every single day if
not twice a day and it's I believe this
is twenty dollars it might be less but
it's not more but around $20 anyways so
amazing it's so hydrating it doesn't
affect my makeup I've run a very small
amount if I use in the morning time at
nighttime I really loaded up though
because I'm dry so I use a lot of all my
products there for dry skin I love the
stuff it's just great next is another
Mario Badescu product and this is the
caviar night cream this is some thick
stuff it is for dry and sensitive skin
and it is thick it's like a pace you're
not going to be able to see it because
it's white so I'm sorry but maybe you
can see the texture in here I don't know
yeah you can see it is it's like a paste
really it is and it is so thick and when
it goes on it definitely feels greasy I
mean like it's it's thick but my skin
just absorbs it so quickly and I'll just
say that on the nights where I use this
the next morning when I wake up and I
wash my face I can tell the world of a
difference in my skin if I wake up wash
my face and I didn't put this on the
night before my skin is more dull my
mate doesn't go on as nicely my skin
doesn't look as even this stuff is just
absolutely amazing I love this for dry
skin love it
next is a perfume that I have been
loving
I've never talked about perfume on my
channel before but I am finally doing it
so this is the Daisy by Marc Jacobs this
is not the original this is a limited
edition just for spring and summer and
it's called sunshine it smells so good
now if you don't like Marc Jacobs
perfume in general you're not gonna like
this one
it just it smells like all the other
ones just a little just a little twist
to it just a little more springy summery
scent um it's very similar to Daisy
though it is so amazing it literally I
don't even know how to describe it oh
just smells like sunshine and freedom I
love the packaging these cute little
flowers are so adorable and I basically
love everything that Marc Jacobs puts
out when it comes to perfume I don't
have to smell it I know I'm gonna like
it I love the original Daisy I love dot
I'm not so crazy about Lola but I just
love them all there's one that's like
this and then there's another limited
one that is in a taller bottle and it's
got a pink fluid in it instead of like
this warm e amber color and that one is
a little bit different they smell
similar but they're a little bit
different they're not the same ones at
first I thought it was the exact same
for a few like in different sizes it's
not it's different oh it's just so fresh
like I cannot get enough of it oh my
gosh love it so if you like Marc Jacobs
perfume get your hands on this because
it's limited edition it will sell out
and it is so amazing I will put all of
the notes for that perfume in the bottom
bar so you can read about it so you can
kind of get an idea of what it smells
like so that you will know it's
something that you would like or not
always talk about a makeup product this
is a pigment by Mac and it is tan I have
been obsessed with this oh my gosh you
have no idea I mean I've always liked
this pigment I've owned it for like two
years but this last month I have just
like revisited it and I cannot put it
down I love it so much it looks like
this I used it in my Kourtney Kardashian
tutorial a while ago which I don't
really like that tutorial very much but
that's okay the this pigment is still
used in it but I just love it I mean the
color the name of it tan is just the
perfect color it's like this beautiful
tan champagne color and depending how
you apply it in like
where your eyes are set and where
they're moving it really is so beautiful
iridescent it's just so gorgeous
especially for the spring and summer
time I love it sometimes I just put it
all over the lid which is a little bit
of soft brown in the crease just to kind
of blend out so pretty I mean this is a
gorgeous pigment to have especially for
the summertime if you're like going to
beat the beach a lot just hanging out
just throw this all over the lid will
give you such a beautiful glow and you
can just use some mascara and like a
tinted moisturizer I just I love love
this pigment and you can see how long
Mac pigments last for because I love
this stuff and I have for about two
years and you can see it is still to the
very top so I mean a sample cup of this
will give you enough for the whole
summer you basically won't be able to
use this whole pigment in your lifetime
it's near impossible so next I will talk
about a nail polish I am all over the
beauty board today I'm actually kind of
proud of myself normally it's just
makeup I'm everywhere today so recently
my favorite nail polish has been this
color by Revlon it is called flirt and
it's this purplish pinky color I really
really like these lavender cool tone
Pink's right now it's what's on my nails
I'm not um gonna show you my nails close
up because they are a hot mess do not
judge
I love this color right now for lipstick
and for nail color I just I love it
so yeah I've had this now for about two
two to three months but they still have
it I just saw at the drugstore recently
so that is flirt by Revlon moving on I
will go to lip products because I have
quite a few so I don't know if this is
by Maybelline for some reason Maybelline
rolls off my tongue but I believe these
are the Maybelline whispers um I
obviously they are whispers I think
they're by Maybelline Maybelline
whispers I believe so I'm sorry I have a
hair like tickling my face okay down
here okay so yes the Maybelline whispers
I really really like these it they're
not Maybelline I'm sorry but for some
reason I'm thinking that they are but it
doesn't say anywhere on the packaging if
they are Maybelline or not which is
really weird but anyways these are the
two colors I have an oneis for a couple
of months this was the first one I
bought and I loved this so much that I
got this one
on them both for a couple of months I
want to go get some more though because
I just love them so much my favorite
thing about these is that there's no SPF
in them if
is SPF in them it's a very very light
amount because I can't smell it and SPF
actually really bothers my lips which is
weird because I know that everyone says
wear SPF you know protect your face
protect your lips but SPF just dries my
looks crazy unit it dries them out and
it makes them irritated and I just don't
like the way it tastes so I look for
products that don't have SPF in them
these are very nourishing very
moisturizing and I love the sheer wash
of color to think of I have this one
right here this is pink possibilities I
have this on right now I have it mixed
with Mac's blankety lipstick which is a
nude Mac's blankety looks like just this
just so you know it's just a nude I
haven't mixed in with that but this is
pink possibilities I love that it's like
a sheer tone it's oh it's just so
beautiful it's not frosty it's just got
a nice glow there's no shimmer it just
looks like a light gloss it's like a
kiss of color and then this one is Ola
lilac I want to say huzzah ILAC sounds
better that's okay a lot lilac it is and
this one is really similar to the nail
polish that I showed you but I was
wearing this in my Mac haul video um
like a month or so ago and I got a lot
of people asking me what color I was
wearing my lips and that was it I I was
wearing that in the beginning in the
video I believe yes I was so yeah I love
that I love that cool tone I love what
light washes I'll put a little bit more
of this on so you guys can see how it
goes on it's just a sheer color and I
love it I love it it looks like juicy
I'm not saying that my lips look juicy
I'm just saying like the color just
looks like a juicy fruit I don't know
I'm going crazy I need to get on the
house in my brush video that I did just
like two videos ago I got so many
questions about the lip gloss I was
wearing in that video and I mentioned
down in the bar down below that it
wasn't NYX butter gloss but I didn't
know the shade and I wasn't near the lip
gloss at the time I wasn't at my house
so anyways I under fighting it out I
have been wearing this color all the
time and it's called Eclair EC la I are
later
and this is the color that I was wearing
once again it's like the same shades as
like the nail-polish and um a lot lilac
that I showed you it's around the same
it's the same family because it's got
that purplish in it but it's still a
pink but it's not as purpley as the
other colors but I'll show it to you
it's so pretty I have to say that these
losses are quickly becoming my favorite
glosses at the moment so that's the NYX
butter gloss and Eclair it's like a
purpley pink absolutely love it you guys
I got so many comments on my brush video
asking me what gloss I was wearing so
that is it NYX butter gloss and Eclair
and then panda with that I also got
creme brulee which is a butter gloss as
well love this one it's more of just a
pink like a true pale pink maybe with a
tiny bit of peach in it and that one is
right there next to it so that's the
Eclair and that's the creme brulee I
love both of them I've been going back
and forth they are so smooth on your
lips oh my gosh they truly feel like
butter and they're only like three to
five dollars love the photo on Instagram
of myself a couple of weeks ago I don't
know how to describe it my hair was down
and I was wear like a denim shirt and I
mentioned something about pink lips in
it and I was talking about this pink lip
liner by NYX and this is pinks and eight
five six pinks and I love love this lip
liner it is such a true pink it looks
great with you can wear it with any of
these Pink's I have swatched on my hands
right now you can put it on really sheer
and kind of buff it out to give like a
light touch of pink or you can really
draw like the whole mouth with the lip
liner and then go over it with a gloss
to have like a bright vivid pink I love
love this lip liner once again I think
it was a 2 $53 somewhere around there
awesome is the seal Bigelow mentha lip
shine it's 100% natural mint and it has
peppermint oil in it
oh I wish I could hold this up to the
camera and make you smell it it is so
refreshing whenever I put it on everyone
in the room asks me for a breath mint
and I'm like sorry that's just my lip
gloss
it doesn't have any poof okay that cap
is gone it does
have any color in it whatsoever it's
just a sheer wash of gloss absolutely
love it though it's moisturizing it
smells so good it tastes so good
absolutely loved all right so next I
have a hair product to mention which I
never do but I love this stuff it is the
batiste I think that's how you call it
batiste dry shampoo I got this at Ulta
the same time I got these butter glosses
and I would say a month than I have to
go and I stopped seeing the shelf and it
just a couple of bucks and I thought hey
why not and then I've seen some girls
talk about this brand actually on
YouTube a few of them I don't know any
names but I have I have seen a few
people mention them um
doesn't really have much of an
interesting smell but the reason I was
drawn to it is because it says it has a
hint of color for dark and deep brown so
I mean like you can see if the little
squirt thing does look Brown when I
spray it I don't really notice it having
any tint of color to it but that's what
dropped me to it because you know when
you use dry shampoo when you have dark
hair like me it's going to be like a
white cast and that's not cute um and
you might be thinking why I used rayon
dry shampoo because I am a dry person I
do not get oily hair like seriously I
could not wash my hair for five or six
days and my hair would still just be
normal like I can still just style it I
don't have I don't have to wash it all
the time because it just stays dry um
but the reason I use this is for volume
I love love dry shampoo for volume like
I'll just spray a little bit at the
roots like far away I'll just give it a
little spray and then I'll take like a
round brush or just a blow-dryer and put
my head upside down and just run some
key through it for like 20 seconds and
it'll give me a lot of volume so I can
work with my hair because my hair is
very fine and it just kind of lays and
just like yeah Oh axe so sad and
pathetic so dry shampoo really gives it
a boost I love love love this stuff my
favorite blush in this last month that I
cannot stop using which I've talked
about a couple of times before is Mac's
spring shade this is very similar to
NARS orgasm I told you that a couple of
times it has I'll show you orgasm
actually and you can see so organic just
has more pink in it but they haven't the
same sheen I personally like Mac's
better I mean I love NARS orgasm
but Spring Sheen I love it's the perfect
amount of pink peach and pink and gold
it goes on and gives you this beautiful
Sheen it is so easy to blend so easy to
work with looks good on basically
everybody it's a great great color so I
love that it's not strictly peach or
strictly pink it's got a little bit of
both and that's what makes it so
versatile it's so great for different
skin tones so then I only have three
more things this is the Sigma p84 brush
I love this brush this is one of the
little precision brushes it comes in a
kit let me find there we go it comes in
a kit for like this so that you can have
all of them I washed all of them like a
day or two ago but I use this one every
day I really like these I like these for
highlighting and precise contouring I
really really like these brushes but the
p84 is when I said yeah the p84 is the
my favorite for concealer I absolutely
love it it just buffs out and blends
your concealer so beautifully I do use
the Beauty Blender as well for my full
foundation routine I do use three
different tools um that might seem
excessive but I've just kind of learned
through trial and error what works for
me and what lasts throughout the whole
day but I just love this brush love it I
didn't think I was going to like it as
much as I do it's just it's beautiful so
the P 84 by Sigma blends out and gives
you full coverage but a smooth full
coverage love this I got these about a
week and a half ago two weeks ago our
velour lashes they are 100% mink fur I'm
sure you guys have heard about them here
on YouTube um I know that's how I heard
about them was here on YouTube a lot of
girls talk about how amazing they are
they are pricey I mean like one pair of
lashes like 25 dollars it's intense but
what sold me on it is that it's 100%
mink fur it's 100% handmade no animals
are harmed there's no animal cruelty
involved in this process of making these
lashes and you can wear them up to 25
times I know that sounds insane and I
honestly didn't believe it but this is
my sixth day wearing these six
and they seriously keep getting better
every single time I put them on they
really do the first day I put them on I
was in oh I like these in the second day
I liked them better and better and
better it's my sixth time and I still
feel like I'm not even halfway done with
them I mean like so when you think about
$25 for one pair of lashes that is
outrageous I'm sorry if that's what I
immediately think but now that I have
them I'm like $25 I'll spend it again
it's amazing I love the packaging I love
that it's magnetic and you can keep them
nice and safe in here it's not some
nasty packaging that's going to fall
apart it's not flimsy it's it's good so
I'm actually going to zoom you into my
lashes so that you can see them because
I've worn them in a few photos recently
and so many of you asked me questions
about them so you can see what they look
like up close you can see how fluffy
they are and when I touch them I
basically can't even feel them they're
just so fluffy and lightweight and they
have such a durable band when you glue
them on it's like they don't move and
the band is jet black which is awesome
because I don't even have to go over and
cover the band with eyeliner so I
absolutely love these if you are a bride
I'm highly whoa I highly suggest
investing in a pair of these lashes for
your wedding day because they're amazing
absolutely gorgeous so two more things
next I'm going to talk about a palette
that I have been obsessing over this is
the Sigma palette by Sigma Beauty now
let me just say I know I received a lot
of comments in my brush video about
everyone telling me I was being
sponsored by Sigma they were paying me
to say these things and how my video was
a Sigma commercial you guys go ahead
think what you want but Sigma's not
paying me a dollar to represent them I
am NOT signed to a contract with them
they are not telling me what to say
nothing like that is going on I'm not
being sketchy with you I am being very
very honest and like I stated in a few
comments and honestly hurt my feelings
did you guys even thought that about me
because I feel like I made it clear that
I'm not a person to give in to contracts
or do something for the money like I'm
not going to talk about something that I
don't believe in it
absolutely no idea how many people and
things I have turned down and refused to
talk about even when they're offering me
money because this channel is about
beauty and it's about feeling good about
yourselves and I'm not going to feel
good about myself if I'm lying to you
for some extra cash like that's
ridiculous that's that's what the world
is coming to it makes me a little sick
so anyways
with that being said huh let's move on
the Sigma palette the resort palette it
is so pretty
it came out I don't know when I don't
keep up but it came out I believe just a
couple of weeks ago I got it right when
it came out because I'm so attracted to
the shades so basically I post their
photo on Instagram of really crazy blue
and green makeup and I told you guys I
was going to an 80s themed girls night
and I was wearing these two shades right
here the Mila and the Midori and they
are so pigmented I mean barely touching
them it's just like it's insane so I
love this because I think it's so
versatile how much you need for a smoky
eye it has what you need for a
springtime line and it hasn't you need
for like bangin color on your eyes it is
absolutely beautiful if you know me you
know the first color the reason that I
wanted this in the first place was this
shade right here the Topaz sorry I have
other colors on my finger so it's not
showing up this warm brown right there I
absolutely love these warm colors I
cannot get enough of like this reddish
burnt almost like coppery Brown I love
it and then fawn right here absolutely
beautiful it's like the most gorgeous
champagne e pewter it's not strictly
silver or gold it's right in between
which is like my dream I shadow oh I
love it so yeah these are actually
gorgeous this is a beautiful beautiful
highlight shade right here the Luna um I
just I love it
I think it's great and it comes to the
blush heavenly it comes with a double
sided eyeliner and blue and brown and it
comes with a liquid highlighter but I
just I'm obsessed with it it's a great
palette the pigmentation is amazing and
I am very
be happy that I got this product I have
one more thing to mention which might be
a little random and a little weird but
it wouldn't be Jacqueline if it wasn't a
little random and a little weird so I
was gonna tell you guys it's a room
spray now I got this ABB's t.j.maxx
it was 399 and this was the best
investment for a good smelling house
that I have ever gotten it is so good I
got my set in lemon pound cake I really
really like everything in my house to
smell like lemon and citrus and fruity
not so much in the wintertime but
especially in the springtime I want
everything to smell just like clean like
ah refreshing I don't know that's just
me this is the bomb it's the aroma
collection room spray imine lemon pound
cake they have it in like lavender
vanilla hazelnut all these different
scents that this is the one I got and
I'm gonna show you how much it shoots
out I'm gonna spray it behind me I
wasn't gonna get on it but like woah
it's intense and I mean it's a decent
sized bottle it's only four dollars and
it will make your room smell so good for
so long so I know that's random but if
you guys like to have good smelling
homes which I know we all do this is a
great great room spray and if you don't
want to burn candles for any reason it's
just awesome so that is all I have my
March favorites let me know if there is
anything that you guys absolutely love
in the month of March and you kind of
get enough of something you discover
that you think that I would enjoy just
let me know in the comments below I will
see you guys soon
I love you guys and I'll see you later
