my March favorites for you I'm so
excited to be filming this video I'm
like so antsy and all over the place I
have been gone for two weeks and I have
missed you guys so much like I have
talked about filming for the past week
story I honestly miss you guys so much
my sister came down with her husband and
her two kids they drove down from
Illinois god bless her for driving it
with two small children across the
country
um came down here and stayed with me and
then my brother and his family who live
like right down the street they were at
my house pretty much every day so for
the past two weeks we've been at the
pool fun-in-the-sun we've been at the
beach we've been going out to eat we've
been gaining weight it's been amazing um
but it feels so good to like get back
into the routine of things it was
definitely a vacation like I was
thinking it was a Saturday on a
Wednesday and I was thinking it was a
Wednesday on the Tuesday and like but
that means you're doing vacation right
right when you forget what day it is I
feel like that's a good sign so but I
was very active on all my other social
Ziff i other ever disappeared here from
youtube you can usually find me on
twitter and snapchat and instagram i
posted every single day on other socials
to kind of keep you guys up to date a
part of my life but it was amazing I
needed that break so much I felt very
guilty it's like walking away kind of
like walking away from work walking away
from YouTube I just felt like uh but I
am so glad that I took the time just to
truly be present with my family I just I
feel revitalized
I feel ready to film I feel ready to get
back to work so yes thanks so much for
just like being patient while I spent
time with my family I hope you guys had
a wonderful Easter um I'm feeling very
springy and festive and it is gloomy as
can be outside like it looks like it's
7:45 at night and it's like three
o'clock in the afternoon it is like dark
today and oh my god I'm ready for my
read up I'm feeling like so separate and
I'm like okay why is the weather not
coordinating with my outfit thank you
very much
okay so let's jump into it these I have
a
I prize to talk about you guys is
probably a very long video so let's go
ahead and get started I am so in love
with bite beauty's new lipsticks they
came out a very wide range of shades
I've always loved bite Beauty anytime
they come on anything I run to order it
actually I don't run I don't go anywhere
it's open up my laptop and I order
sitting on the comfort of my couch let's
get real but I just love bite you if you
guys don't know bite Beauty the reason
that it's called bite is because
everything is like all-natural and I've
made with fruits and so you can bite it
the mean I don't suggest buying lipstick
to eat but it's nice to have your
options so they came out with a ton of
new shades in their amuse-bouche line
amuse-bouche amuse mobile they sent out
a PR package but they didn't send all
the colors so I got online and bought
all of the nudes I'm in love with the
shade which is like kind of different
for me because I love my neutrals but I
very rarely will like a shade like this
it is very baby pink they're just so
beautiful and creamy and pigmented
they're not too creamy where they just
slide off your lips they're not overly
pigmented where they're dry they really
are just a gorgeous formula I love it so
much
another shade that I die for in the
collection is called meringue it is
truly the perfect nude such a gorgeous
shade I've been wearing it like crazy
I had it in my same purse for like two
weeks straight I was wearing it like
every day and it's just gone like it
grew legs and walked out of my life I
don't know where it went but it just
disappeared a couple days ago I bet my
sister took it girl I know where you
live I'm coming for you so I've talked
about this lip gloss before but I want
to talk about it again because the
formula and the color overall this is my
favorite gloss of all time if I had to
pick one this would be it it is by Marc
Jacobs and it is the shade sugar sugar
it is the perfect formula first of all
I've said this a million times the
formula of Marc Jacobs glosses are worth
every penny in my mind they are just
that slippery wet looking the loss it's
like a glossy gloss it's got just the
right amount of pigment but it's not too
pigmented you can wear this over top of
nude lips if you can wear this by itself
you can wear for the full face you can
wear it with barely any makeup minimal
makeup it is just perfect and this color
is everything to me this
Muller is just the perfect nude where
it's not too white and it's not too
Brown it's perfection
so I rise by itself I wear over all
different news I wear over souffle a lot
this lipstick right here I'll show you
what it looks like over that because I
just love the combination of those two
shades together I just feel like it just
makes every lipstick better it is my
favorite gloss of all time it has
officially been crowned as Queen of my
life I just love it I can't get enough
of it what do I want to talk about next
let's do this I used to be obsessed with
this eyeliner when I used to work at Mac
back in the day
and I just ran out of it and never
replaced it and about five weeks ago or
so I made an order on mac cosmetics calm
and I threw this in my basket I was like
why haven't I use this in such a long
time I really love nude eyeliners like a
creamy nude like I you still use that
one from NARS all the time I think
there's called Ric no it wasn't was it
called I don't know we've kind of
complicated name I think all of Narses
names are complicated except the dirty
one I'm like damn okay I take it there I
really love the Mac on chroma graphic
pencil and nw20 it's a really beautiful
kind of nude creamy liner but anyways I
purchased fascinating.i pole from Mac
and this is just a stark white shade and
I am wearing this right now on my
waterline and as you can see it just
gives like that little extra pop like
you can see that white right there and I
just really really love using this white
liner like in the spring I just think
that it makes it just brings attention
and it just gives you a nice fun pop and
I really like it with a bold lip I just
like it kind of ties together for some
reason am I crazy for thinking this but
I love love this liner and I said before
but I'll say again a trick to making
your eyes a bigger if you feel like you
have small eyes or if you want to do a
smoky eye and you think it's closing
yourself like your eyes in and your
actual eyeballs and eye color is getting
overwhelmed and overpowered by the
makeup lining your inner waterline with
either a creamy nude or a white liner
it's going to bring more attention to
the actual eyes so you can see your
actual eyes your eye color and it'll
kind of open your eyes back up and not
get so swallowed by the makeup so it's
just a makeup artist tip that everyone
uses and it's just a great tip for
making your eyes look a little bit
awake and I have just been loving this
white liner recently I've been wearing
it constantly in my waterline I just
think it's really bright and feminine
and perfect for spring bronzers let's
talk about bronzers so again when I made
that Mac purchase online I picked up a
bronzer that if you watched my old
videos you guys have been here from like
the first couple thousand subscribers
the first year so on my channel this was
my favorite bronzer I used it non-stop
and it is Mac give me Sun I'm pretty
sure in the past when I worked at Mac I
probably went through not being funny
five or six of these compacts I used to
love Mac give me Sun but you know I just
discovered other bronzers fell in love
with new ones
well I refill in love with this one it
has an orange undertone in it so do not
run out and purchase it if you are
really fair or if you have pink
undertones and you're not comfortable
with a really warm bronzy kind of orange
undertone because it's definitely that
caramel vibe to it you know what I'm
saying where some people prefer a more
neutral or red undertone but it's just
such a beautiful beautiful formula Mac
give me son is a mineralized skinfinish
which basically means that it's baked
they bake it in like ovens and Italy Mac
has like this whole backstory about it
but it just makes it very smooth and it
gives kind of like a light sheen no
shimmer no sparkle just like a really
nice kind of natural sheen to the skin
so it's not like a chalkboard matte
bronzer which makes it look more natural
that is what I am wearing today again
because of the orange on our tone just
make sure that you don't put it all over
the center of your face you really want
to keep it on the outer corners just to
bring like that bronzy in without making
yourself look like another bronzer that
I have fallen in love with now this is a
new one to my collection is the butter
bronzer by Physicians Formula oh the
smell of this bronzer is so ridiculous
everyone that comes into my house I'm
like wait before you leave you got a
smell this bronzer like I swear I'm such
a freak but oh my gosh it just smells
like I want to rub this all over my
entire body can like Physicians Formula
please like suck out this scent like I
know I know how makeup is created
they've got to have this set they put in
this I need to take that scent and put
it into body lotion right now thank you
this is amazing like coconut tropical
summery scent in the
accept cute packaging I just love this I
love it so anyways this bronzer will be
perfect for those of you who are looking
for an affordable bronzer that have more
fair skin and you're looking for a
neutral to kind of a red undertone and
your bronzer um it's not super red
there's one there way more the undertone
in it is very slight basically the if I
get any tanner this will not be a
bronzer on me anymore like I'm the
darkest that you can basically be while
still keeping this a bronzer you can see
it right there it applies very smooth
very evenly it looks very natural on the
skin I'm so impressed by it and oh look
more than anything
the smell oh my gosh I'm absolutely
obsessed like it's just so good everyone
that comes into my house how my kid
gotta smell this bronzer and everyone
agrees it's amazing
okay so sticking with like powders I
have fallen in love with a new face
powder like this is the best powder I've
ever used in my entire life and I'm not
surprised because it's by Giorgio Armani
and Giorgio Armani luminous silk
foundation is hands-down my favorite
foundation of all time if I had to
choose one foundation and that was the
only one I can use for the rest of my
life I feel like I want to do like a
like I want to start a video like a tag
video where like you have to answer like
if you had to choose one foundation for
the rest of your life one mascara one
blush one gloss one lipstick like each
makeup products I think they'd be a fun
tag to see like what everyone's absolute
all-time favorites worth like that's the
only you could use the rest of your life
anyways my foundation would be Georgia
romani luminous silk I just feel like
it's impossible to make it look bad it
always works it's just so beautiful so
effortless so I decided to try the
powder because I'm always trying to find
face powders I think these powders are
always a little bit too thick for me
they're always too drying or ways to
matte they're always too chalky
so I'm very picky looking for a face
powder holy guacamole this takes the
cake this is now my queen face powder of
all time it is just so beautiful
honestly even when I put on the back of
my hand it just looks like skin like I
can't even like see the difference
between my hand and the powder it
doesn't have any shimmer no sparkle no
glitter but it just looks like skin with
luminosity it just looks like healthy
skin it's so ridiculously beautiful so I
do my foundation I take a big fluffy
brush I set the whole face and I
absolutely love it I feel like I still
have a
hello I feel like it doesn't matter if I
me because I already am on the dry side
it's just gorgeous
if you do not want to spend the money on
Giorgio Armani but you are looking for a
powder that sounds like this one I would
do the mac mineralize skinfinish that's
what I've always used up until this one
it's a very beautiful powder it's the
same formula the Mac give me son it
looks gorgeous it has a luminosity to it
but I'm going to be honest I do like
this one a little bit more because I
feel like it does allow my skin to be a
little bit more luminous okay so I am
like excited to talk about this because
it's such an amazing foundation but
dreading it at the same time because it
is the most expensive foundation that I
have ever owned I've never spent this
much money on foundation I don't think
there's foundations are more expensive
than this this is by the brand lemare
and if you know Lamar you're like mmhmm
because they are crazy expensive they
have like eye creams and moisturizers
they're like over a thousand dollars
like it's intense and I've never been on
the lemare bandwagon on this is my first
ever a little bit just I feel super
bougie right now the reason I bought
this is because I was online shopping
and I came across it and I saw all these
amazing ratings and how it's like not
only a foundation but it's like a skin
treatment it has all the skin care in it
and it's supposed to brighten and
tighten and clarify and it's also
supposed to act as a sunscreen in the
summer it has SPF 15 it's called
treatment fluid foundation so it's
supposed to be a skin treatment and help
with your skin while being a foundation
so I was like let's just try it let's
see I buy so many products and try it
out all the times what I do so got to my
house I put on just thinking like if
this does not make my skin look like
then it's being returned well that's
exactly what happened I applied it and I
was just like oh my gosh I was
absolutely in love it is just it's a
full coverage foundation it's very
creamy
it's very dewy it's like an doing
natural but it's not City and like it
doesn't like stick to your face and make
you feel like oh god I gotta get this
off coz like some foundations are so
dewy that you're just like you feel like
you can get like scrape it off
especially in Florida living in this
humidity you're like you can't handle it
you like rip your face off um it doesn't
settle subtle it doesn't settle until
like my little fine lines I've really
intense smile lines and everything kind
of settles right
so foundation doesn't settle that's like
a big deal for me um but it also said
that like on the packaging it said that
it's not supposed to settle in fine
lines so it's beautiful I told my mom
that she needs this because my mom she's
a little bit more dry now that she's
getting more mature and I told her how
badly she needs this so she's gonna buy
this as well very soon it's I don't know
if I'll ever actually purchase it
because the fact that it is $85 um
ex-squeeze-me and you know I can get rid
of our dollars okay but it is absolutely
gorgeous so if you feel like spending an
arm and a leg and selling your soul for
a foundation I would recommend lemare
okay next I have a deodorant I've
mentioned this brand before but I have
to mention this specific one because
everyone is always looking for a good
deodorant and oh my gosh I'm very picky
about deodorants and so this one is
actually amazing it's by the brand law
of vanilla laboratories you can get a
Sephora my local Sephora doesn't carry
it so I have to buy it online I don't
know if it's like an online only thing
now or if it's just my Sephora they stop
carrying it but anyways I used to use
the lemon one which I really really
liked but this one intrigues me online
because it says Sport Lux on the front
and it's the scent vanilla breeze and
I've been doing really well working out
so the past two weeks I've eaten
whatever the hell I wanted and haven't
worked out once as my family's been here
but before they got here I was doing
really well unlike my workout routine
it's gonna be hard to get back on it oh
my god us um so I saw who sport looks
okay you know how it is like when you're
like on a kick I'm like oh I'm working
out I'm sporting now I need sport
deodorant god I'm such a girl sometimes
so I got this and I am absolutely
obsessed it's 100% natural it's called
the healthy deodorant I could smell this
like perfume like I could wear perfume
the smells like this it smells like
clean laundry like I just want to like
rub it on my clothes it smells so so
good but it doesn't smell like baby
powder because you know how some smell
like really intense baby powder it does
not smell it smell like a lot it doesn't
smell like that and it stays fresh for
so long I feel like when I like raise my
arms I'm like yeah kind of give it to me
like it smells like perfume not
deodorants so it's bomb and I got mine
from Sephora it has
thing there it won the best of beauty
for Allure magazine in 2015 super cool
okay so a face mask that I have been in
love with that I have forgot to mention
on YouTube for months but I wear this on
snapchat all the time this is actually
my second one because I've gone through
the first one so quickly and I was
sharing it with my friends as well this
is the glam glow gravity mud firming
treatment so I don't know what it's
technically supposed to do I haven't
like read the back I am absolutely in
love with this so it comes with a little
brush and you paint it onto your face
and it's like a platinum platinum like
tinman
silver looking um face mask and then it
dries and you leave on for 20 to 30
minutes and then you peel it off like
you literally like read like peel it off
your face so what I personally noticed
with this face mask is after I use it my
skin just looks so tight and bright just
look so refreshed like my perfect like
pamper at home night I will wash my face
I will exfoliate I will use this firming
glam glow mask then I will use the
hydrating glam glow mask the one in the
blue little tub and then I will go in
and moisturize and the next day my
makeup goes on like a dream I'm gonna
see if I can get you guys a discount
code for glam glow because they did
reach out to me a couple months ago and
they told me that they would really like
to give us another discount code because
they gave me one like a year and a half
ago I feel like it was a while ago and
it went over really well so they told me
that they wanted to offer my subscribers
another one so gosh there's like a
little fruit flies everywhere so I will
email them after I film this video and
see if they're still open to that and if
they are that I will put the discount
code down below for you guys but it's
Saturday and they might not get back to
me until Monday but we'll see if you're
interested in purchasing it just check
the bottom bar and it may or may not be
there we'll find out I have talked about
this hair brush before but I want to
mention it again because it's just
something that I just like I like to
bring up every once in a while because
if you don't watch every single video
then you may not know about this and
this has truly changed my hair like it's
changed my life when it comes to the way
I do my hair I used to put off washing
my hair just because of the fact that my
hair would be so tingly that I wouldn't
want to have to brush it when I got on
the shower and this tangled
is just ridiculous I have absolutely no
pain no struggle like ever since I got
on this brush there has not been one
time where it's been like ah like it
literally just any tangle just comes out
I have such fine hair it just gets
tingly so easily and it's just always
been such a pain right get out of the
shower to brush my hair but with this
thing it's just so simple and like all
of my little nieces and my family they
all have such sensitive scalps and we
brush their hair they're like ow ow ow I
feel like when I was gonna grow up my
mom didn't care she's like ripped
through my hair and here's me coming
down my face and I'd be like act strong
I'm strong but like all my nieces are so
sensitive when they get their hair brush
so when they come to my house they
always take bubble baths like I don't
know what it is it's our thing they come
over they want to take a bubble bath I
give them like bath bombs and give them
tons of bubbles and when they get out we
always use a tangle teezer and they love
it my hair color a same thing he didn't
have this and I was it you had the
tangle teezer are you kidding me how do
you brush your clients hair so now he
has tangle teasers all over his salon
it's just the best if you have kids if
you've tangly hair it's the bomb I've
always bought online on Amazon but there
are sold at Sephora now so it's awesome
uh they have different sizes and this is
the best size in my opinion they have a
mini size it doesn't work the same and
they have like a big size and I don't
think it works the same this is the bomb
calm hairbrush right here when I go out
of town and I forget it sometimes and I
have to use just regular hair brushes I
remember like I realized how much I love
that things I'm still used to it that
kind of forget how much I love it until
I don't have it and then I'm like oh I
need the title teaser this body cream
you guys oh my gosh and I finally bought
it this is a product that I have loved
for years and years and years when I
worked at the Mac counter at Nordstrom
um Laura Mercier was like the little
boost and makeup thing counter that's
the word right next to Mac and I would
smell this lotion constantly and I would
moisturize my hands costly because this
lotion is like the best lotion I've
truly ever smelt in my life and it is
the Laura Mercier almond coconut milk
souffle oh my god it's like I can't even
begin to tell you guys how good this
scent is it is ridiculous it is so
amazing my entire family has been so
obsessed with
two weeks I have this sitting on my
kitchen counter um you can get it in a
body butter and like a squeeze tube I
just think this looks so much more glam
so I wanted to get this one because it's
prettier even though the squeeze to be
way more sanitary and I'm going to dip
your hands in it um but look at this can
you see how like it's already like down
to here inside I just got this a couple
weeks ago and it's like 75% gone because
everyone in my family is constantly
going and like lathering up their bodies
with it because it smells so
ridiculously both have a hair product
and this is by the brand verb I actually
got this when I went to a Sephora like
conference type thing and back in August
I went to Las Vegas and it was actually
like the most amazing thing I've gotten
to do so far in my life I got to go on
stage and just like talk about champagne
pop and everything and it was just
incredible and while I was there they
gave me a goodie bag and this was in it
and I just absolutely loved it as you
can see I've used a ton of it it's a sea
salt spray and it says its windswept
waves plus daily dry texture what I love
about this is my hair is so fine and if
I let my hair air dry it is ridiculous
it is just so like man just so straight
and glued to my head like can I get a
little body can I get a little texture
like anything like it just lays flat to
my scalp it's terrible so what I love
about this is I feel like it expands at
my hair strands as weird as that sound
and it gives me a texture where I can
actually like run my fingers through my
hair I can actually do stuff with it as
opposed to just looking like hey on my
head I really really love this so I've
used a lot of sea sprays I think this 90
my favorite one the bumble and bumble
one used to be my favorite but I like
this one right now the best I've been
using it like crazy it's my fave okay so
now for the last two items they are both
clothing items not just any clothing
comfort clothing items which is the best
more than being glam I love comfort
I love comfort more than anything
pillows blankets just anything is
comfortable I'm all about that life so
this is actually a bra that I want to
talk about and I'm mentioning this
because I can't be the only one that
feels this way who's calling me no I
hate bras I hate them so much when I
prana bra in the morning I'm like bitch
like I'm so mad right at home at night I
just
got my bra like you David get away from
me like I hate bras but at the same time
I always wear a bra because I have so
many friends in their 30s who are like I
didn't wear bras all the time my 20s I
was stupid I lost all the elasticity now
I want to get like I want to get them
fill that when I get them lifted they
just look so bad stretch marks now and
I'm like oh my god even though I don't
have big boobs I still have something
I'm a woman and I don't want I want to
like preserve what I do have I don't
want to take off my shirt and be like oh
my god what did I do to myself you know
because if all my friends are like
scaring the crap out of me and warning
me so my sister entered sister
introduced me to this bra
it's from Nordstrom it's by the brand
Nordstrom lingerie and it's called the
day bra and it just looks like this it's
a seamless bra and it is the most
comfortable thing I've ever experienced
in my life like it's a pleasure to put
this on so when I wake up in the morning
this is what I wear when I go home at
night this is what I wear I only wear
normal bra now when I actually address
and leave my house but when I'm home
this is what I wear it gives you support
with it doesn't give you any push ups
not like sexy or Vava voom but it's
going to support you while being
extremely comfortable to the point that
you can sleep in this and like you won't
you know you have it on it's so comfy
yeah now last but not least my favorite
thing of the month this is actually
probably my number one favorite no no
the bras number one this is my my number
two this is a bathrobe I got this from
Nordstrom and it's by the Brandt Brandt
book brand barefoot dreams it is the
most luxurious soft buttery feeling
clothing in the world there's a such
thing as buttery fabric this is it right
here have you guys ever touched out like
Bed Bath and Beyond
they have blankets there where like you
touch them and they're so soft they
almost feel moisturizing like they
literally feel buttery I'm sure some you
know I'm talking about that's what this
fabric is like so this robe it's a long
row that comes down like past my knees
