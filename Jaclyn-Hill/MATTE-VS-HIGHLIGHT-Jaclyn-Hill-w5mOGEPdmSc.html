black hoody in the pink background I
don't know why this is giving me like
major like Avril Lavigne flashback vibes
taking me back to my roots my Hot Topic
days so last night I had a dream that I
left my house and forgot to put
highlighter on one side of my face and
listen guys I get it all right I think I
I'm thinking the exact same thing as the
rest of you all right I can't think of
something that's even more of a first
world problem then what I'm talking
about at this moment but this was my
dream I dreamt that I left my house and
I kept like looking in mirrors be like
oh my god that was like a shaved it like
the side of my face I had no highlights
so I woke up and I was like I don't want
to do that like I kind of want to do
half of my face the maximum beautiful
glow and I want to do all matte
everything the other side and I sort of
see the difference of what it does to my
face because we right now in the beauty
industry are so obsessed with highlight
that I take it to another level
sometimes well I'll leave the house and
if it's too much also I really
appreciate if you know you guys made
comments about my appearance today
because I obviously tried very hard to
look good for you okay my bun is doing
things in going places unlike my haters
I'm gonna do my right side of my face my
glowing side because this is my higher
cheekbone so therefore my highlight pops
harder on my right side but this is also
the bad side of my face using my crooked
nose so I always pull like this in
photos and I show you this side but this
side is actually like baby with my
highlight I just thought I wouldn't
expose myself
first I'm gonna prep the rice out of my
face with the Sicily double tinsel I
don't know how to pronounce that I'm
sure I sound like a duck afterwards
gonna get through it
this truly one of my favorite pirate
ever this is actually my second bottle
so expensive when I bought the second
bottle like are you really doing this
and then my inner like makeup demon was
like yes this is the poor perfecting no
I'm sorry if the global perfect pore
minimizer of Isis Lee this stuff is balm
for your pores but I'm gonna put that
all over this side of my face for the
left side of my face I'm gonna be using
the Dior forever foundation just because
this is the maddest foundation I have
now keep in mind I am
normal to dry so I don't have a ton of
Matt affine products like laying around
in my collection just because I don't
like to be but I got the mattes of
everything I could find so I'm gonna go
ahead honey that is not yo color let's
let's do that again
it's gonna be a full coverage day all
okay so now on the right side of my face
I'm gonna be going in with two
foundations just because I'm a
high-maintenance bitch I'm gonna go in
with the Bourjois healthy mix serum
foundation I learn and I'm gonna also
mix it with a little bit of the lemare
the treatment fluid foundation very
different price where you just clearly
I'm gonna go in with a little bit
because neither of them are actually my
color and I'm gonna take some Giorgio
Armani fluid shear and I mean this is in
the shade too
I'm gonna go ahead and put a pump of
that into the foundation on the back of
my hands now I've never actually used
this specific like um what do we even
want to call it like a shimmering liquid
before in my foundation now I've used
many others and I love the way it looks
but this is my first time using this
specific one but I've heard such great
things about it and then I'm just like
assuming that it's gonna be bomb but I
guess we gonna find out the one thing I
will say is the matte side of my face
does look a little bit more wrinkly like
the matte it's kind of like emphasizing
the wrinkles but on this side the really
dewy is definitely emphasizing my pores
so like the dewy has a negative and then
matt has a negative but I actually think
the dewy has more of a negative so far
I'm gonna go with the same concealer
which is the Tarte shape tape on both
eyes I'm curious to see how like using
this generous amount of concealer how
it's going to like change the dewy side
and the matte side you know me see
okay well this side yeah well my matte
side is looking so much more flawless
okay it's on the left side of my face
and matte side I'm gonna be using it in
the RCM a original translucent powder
I'm going to be taking just a little bit
other in the cap with a damp Beauty
sponge and I'm going to just put that
underneath of my eye to set my concealer
and then on the right side for the
highlighted part I'm going to go in with
the Kat Von D shade light palette I'm
going to use this yellow color and that
really light
kind of bisque color I'm gonna put it
down my under eye I'm just putting my
beauty sponge right in there and we're
going to just set that so at this point
I definitely like the highlighted area
better than the Mac I feel like that
powder kind of made the concealer a
little bit darker which is normal and
just like a little blotchy which again
happens with transitive powder
especially if you go in when the
concealer is still tacky and not fully
dry but I like this highlighted area
much better at this point okay so now
I'm gonna set my face with powder so for
the highlighted side I'm going to go in
with these shots of Chi compact makeup
it's just a really really beautiful face
powder that I have been using the past
month and I love it and it definitely
has like a really beautiful natural
finish to it okay so now for the matte
side of my face I'm gonna go in with the
cover of X perfecting setting powder I'm
gonna apply it the exact same way that I
applied the powder on my right side just
with the flat side of a beauty sponge
this is so interesting I'm actually
learning so much about makeup doing this
because now that my entire face has
foundation concealer powder the under
eyes have been set like the base is done
and I've backed the mirror up my right
side has hands down my favorite side
which is the side that in the beginning
was making my pores look large and I
wasn't into this highlighted dewy side
but now that everything is set this eye
look so much better my left side
definitely looks like a little crusty
it's kind of like sticking on it's like
aw like my little peach fuzz hairs in my
face or is that the right side
definitely has a like more life to it
okay so let me do my eyebrows really
quick because that doesn't even matter
in this video and I'll be right back I'm
gonna grab the Laura Lee Los Angeles
cat's pajamas eyes shadow palette I am
so happy and proud for her I just have
to say on a side note this is so freakin
awesome the fact that a youtuber who
started from nothing just living in
Alabama can move the big city of La and
come out with her own cosmetic line that
she did on her own like this is some
dope shit right here and I'm so happy
for her I'm gonna go in with the shade
bomb diggity I'm gonna put
in my crease I'm gonna put that in both
of my creases I'm gonna take a little
bit of cray cray
right next door and put that right there
my crease as well
such a pretty color I'm gonna grab the
first shade okie doke which is a matte
white I'm gonna put that all over the
lid on my matte side that is pigmented
now for the right highlighted side I'm
gonna go in with my palettes because the
cat's pajama pal it doesn't have a like
shimmering white so I'm gonna go in it
with the first guy right here and put
that all over the lid the exact same way
that I put the matte shade over on the
side thank god I've never used this
color over my lid before this envy you
oh I'm gonna go ahead and take that same
color I'm just going to highlight my
brow bone oh my god it's gonna be weird
to not highlight this brow bone I'm
gonna put that highlight right there on
that inner corner of the eye of course
so now that we have that shadow done I
definitely feel like this eye the old
matte is way more natural looking and
this eye definitely looks like it's more
ready for stage it's much more like poof
and drama that's for sure okay so now
I'm going to bronze my face I'm gonna go
with two separate bronzers of course to
the right side my face I'm gonna go in
with the hourglass ambient luminous
bronze light I can definitely see the
light that it's bringing to my face for
sure it is adding some shimmer and like
highlight up in here then on the less of
my face I'm gonna go in with the Too
Faced chocolate Soleil because we all
know that this is a totally matte
bronzer
okay first of all the color of that
bronzer looks absolutely terrible on my
skin like I don't know why is I'd use
this bronzer several times I mean I
always use it over different products
but for some reason today I don't know
why it is looking very muddy so now it's
we can step back and looking into my
mirror this side is actually much better
than this side right now this just looks
so damn dry and a little blotchy and
this side definitely has a glow on the
face and just looks healthier in general
I'm actually gonna try to fix how
blotchy and bad my bronze looks over
here cuz it's just really bothering me
I'm gonna go with some mac studio care
blend pressed powder and a different
brush and see if going or that can help
a sister out or something okay things
are just only going downhill now
alright let's apply blush for the Mac
side of my face I'm gonna go in with
Becca
wild honey okay and the right side my
face I'm gonna use Becca damselfly blush
it has some really pretty shimmer
running through it actually I'm gonna
grab some sombre because this actually
has more shimmer right in it so I'm
gonna grab a load of that one too
the right side of my face has so much
more life it is insane I'm gonna grab
these two shades right here again and
just mix those together I'm gonna grab
the shade Central Park from my palette
which is just a dark brown I'm gonna put
that really tightly on my lower lash
line I'm gonna curl my eyelashes I'm
just applying mascara obviously I'm
using the same mascara and the same
technique on both eyes all right so now
I have mascara applied and the last
thing gonna do to my eyes I'm gonna go
back in with that same light shade from
my palette and I'm gonna highlight my
inner rim I know this might look a
little weird but I'm just going to dab
that I shot out right there so I'm just
so curious to see how this is gonna
change the look and what its gonna do to
my eyes versus this one okay so now for
the face highlight I'm so excited I'm
gonna grab my weapon and make shit
happen I'm gonna mix gilded honey by
laura geller with the Kylie cosmetics
loose pigment in the shade of Santorini
this combo that one all right and I'm
gonna take that and I'm gonna put it
right here above my brow like I usually
do nothing's happening
okay now I'm gonna highlight one Cupid's
bow just like this side mm-hmm and then
one side of my nose in the one so
dimension which is actually perfect
because this side is the one with the
oncoming cyst under my skin cells going
our light this side okay so now for my
lips on the left hand side I'm gonna go
in with the shade mannequin by jeffree
star cosmetics actually I changed my
mind because this is getting too
difficult so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
put mannequin all over my lips I'm just
gonna put gloss on this half all right
so now I'm gonna go in with the Mac of
gloss this is in the shade under the
sheets I do not have a Mac setting
spreadsheet whose an all nuts I don't
like to be mad I don't like maps and
sprays so I'm going to use the morphe
prep and set setting spray on the right
side of my face uncle's gonna leave this
side completely alone and then just to
be extra I'm gonna use a little bit of
the tatcha luminous dewy skin miss on
this side as well okay so the most
surprising thing for me hands down I
can't believe I'm even gonna say this
piece I love this glow it is beautiful
it's rady and all that but it ages me
this side of my face looks so much
younger and more supple and this side of
my face looks older I would say that
this side of my face it probably looks
like I'm five years older than this not
to mention my bronze looks like a hot
mess over here but it still looks more
youthful than this side but before the
highlights this side was the better side
in my opinion it looked more youthful
and dewy and glowy
but once that went on it just aged me
which I absolutely love I love this
that's a thing like I'm not gonna stop
wearing a highlighter but I am way more
aware now what it actually does to my
face that's for sure
so one thing I'm taking away from this
big time is that I need to stop
highlighting above my brow bone because
all it is doing truly is emphasizing
all those little fine lines and wrinkles
I have above my brow if I do highlight
up there I'm gonna stop right here I'll
highly
right in this area and not bring it too
far up because that definitely is not
doing me any favors now far away when I
look at myself in the mirror it looks
really nice so really complements my eye
area it kind of lifts my brow it gives
like a really beautiful look but then
once I get closer up if someone was
having a conversation with me I feel
like they would be like so as for the
eyes and my opinion and this eye looks
much more fresh alive and awake and
bigger another thing I have learned is I
can never live another day of my life
without doing an inner corner highlight
because I cannot believe how much
attention that is bringing to my eyes
and especially the color of my eye I
feel more than this one like that little
pop right there just like brings
attention I feel like even more than the
brow highlight definitely the shimmer
highlighted shadow all over the lid is
making it look like I have much more
less space than this one this one I
don't really notice my lid at all it's
just very blank this one makes it look
like I have you long dated lid space so
if you have a smaller lid I would
suggest doing a light shimmery eyeshadow
because it's like full I feel like this
eye just looks basic and this one is
like BAM bitch you see this gloss right
now this is disgusting what's doing it
so even though the highlight on the face
and above the brow is not giving me life
compared to the map side the one thing
that I have learned is I will never
leave nor forsake my Cupid's bow
highlight because this highlight over
here makes my lip look so much plumper
which is actually funny because again
this side of my lips are actually the
more plump side and naturally when I get
them filled I always to have her do a
little bit more on my right side because
these are like the smaller side
naturally in this side with the gloss
and not highlight here and that
highlight right there on my chin like
that whole mouth situation my lips look
so much fuller with that gloss so much
plumper with that highlight like it just
looks like a different set of lips where
this one is just fine but very basic so
that is it you guys that completes this
video I hope that you enjoyed hanging
out with me today and seeing the
difference between highlighted and matte
this is very interesting to me and I'm
gonna keep this on like the next 30
minutes and just kind of keep looking at
myself in the mirror as I'm doing things
in my house because I'm just so
intrigued by the situation and the
differences so comment down below tell
me which side you liked better tell me
what you learn from this video
tell me there's anything that you're
gonna start doing or stop doing or
whatever it may be because of this
because I definitely learned some things
and I definitely think that going
forward I'm going to mattify my face a
little bit more and focus more on the
eyes because I feel like if I could put
this eye on this face you know I'm
saying that's which this would be like
beautiful I've definitely learned
several things in this video let me know
what you've learned in the comment
section down below I love you guys so
much don't forget to give the video a
thumbs up and please subscribe to my
channel if you enjoyed and I'll see you
guys soon
ma byte I didn't have it my face
completely matte mm-hmm what's that my
face completely like highlighted and
glowy right what's your favorite side
like overall hmm
turn to the right turn left just what do
you think makes me look the prettiest I
like left which this I'm gloss this side
really yeah what makes you say gloss is
if you has the lips no it's the
highlighter I like the highlight you
like everything on this side better yeah
turn one more time
yeah I like that side better but I think
when I got done I think that this side
ages me I think that the highlight right
here it looks nice when I'm just like
calm like this but when I talk and I
smile I feel like this side better and
this side ages me true you take the same
mm-hmm I mean they're both good they're
both they both look really good it's
just kind of how you're feeling that day
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
