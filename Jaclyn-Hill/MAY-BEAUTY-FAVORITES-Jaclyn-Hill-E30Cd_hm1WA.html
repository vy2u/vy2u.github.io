my may favorites video I honestly was
not planning on doing a favorites video
the favorites video this month just
because I don't feel like I have that
many products and I haven't done a lot
of shopping this month so I don't have
anything new and exciting to talk about
but when I tweeted you guys giving you a
heads up that there be no favorites
video there was so much disappointment
that I felt really really bad and
figured I have to do one even if it's
not going to be amazing
so let's gonna do it first of all I just
got back from the movie theater with my
family and I'm like a little frazzled
right now because we just saw Maleficent
which is my first favorites of the month
because oh my god I have literally been
waiting almost two years for this movie
to come out I saw a poster for in June
of 2012 that just had Angelina's face
and it said Maleficent 2014 and I was
like and literally for two years
straight I've been like a girl gone
crazy counting down for this movie to
come out so I just absolutely loved it
it was phenomenal I was blown away by
the artistry in every aspect the makeup
artistry the artistry and the film
itself just where everything was filmed
it was beautiful it was amazing it it
blew my mind and exceeded my
expectations so go see Maleficent my
first favorite of the month is a
foundation and this is by Smashbox and
this is the studio skin a 15-hour we're
hydrating foundation this comes to a
natural finish and it is a full coverage
foundation I will warn you right I
warned you I will warn you right off the
bat that as you are blending this it's
very hydrating you're like ooh lovely
okay my watch is literally falling off
okay seriously I've owned this watch for
like six months and I'm just now
realizing to turn off the plastic cover
as you are blending out this foundation
it feels very hydrating on the skin once
you allow it to set after five or ten
minutes it is going to feel like glue it
literally adheres to the skin it lasts
all day long it is a 15 hour where
foundation it is not going anywhere but
you are going to feel it on the skin it
feels very similar to mac prolongwear
foundation and any of you have ever
tried that foundation before this would
be great for someone
has oil on their skin because it's
seriously just like yeah and doesn't
move it is full coverage it is
absolutely beautiful when I apply this I
spray some fix plus any hydrating facial
mist I spray it on the brush and then go
in and it makes it not feel so on my
face because it just kind of shares it
out a little bit that's how I like
wearing it but it's just absolutely
beautiful it lays gorgeous on the skin
I've really been liking it so studio
Skin Foundation by Smashbox another
foundation I have been using this month
is an oldie but a goodie and this is Mac
face and body foundation this is the old
school packaging this is like the Jumbo
bottle this is four ounces the new
bottle is 1.7 fluid ounces I believe I
am using shades c2 at the moment which
is very fair how I wear this is I mixed
it in with my current foundation by
itself this is a water-based foundation
it is also waterproof which is great for
the summer time because you can use on
the face or the body and you can go
swimming and it's not gonna budge you
have to have a makeup remover or a face
wash in order to remove this which is
great in the summer time I mix this in
with my foundation though because it is
super super watery and very very
hydrating and very sheer so when I mix
it in it's just like the best of both
worlds it sheers out my current
foundation a little bit makes it a
little bit more slippery on the skin it
gives just a beautiful healthy more
natural glow and I love love that look
for the summer time so I have been using
this a lot recently mixing with my
foundation and it's just absolutely
beautiful so Mac face and body this is a
total random product but this is the
house of lashes eyelash adhesive so this
is just lash glue I got this because I
ordered a bunch of false lashes from
house of lashes months and months and
months ago and got this as well and I
did not ever think of using it until I
ran out of my duo eyelash like he said
that I always use and literally I was
sitting at my vanity and I had nothing I
reached over and grabbed this and I have
been using it for three months straight
it is literally at the very very bottom
I have to order some more I should
actually do that tonight because there's
pretty much like none left it's
embarrassing how disgusting this tube
looks right now but this is such a great
eye
I have not had an issue for three months
I have been using this with my eyelashes
nothing has popped off in the inner
outer corner sometimes that can happen I
don't think it's technically waterproof
but I haven't had an issue with that
either the wand is so unique so awesome
to apply you don't have to squeeze or
get messy eyelash glue anywhere you just
pull it out swipe it on like a lipgloss
and then let it dry it dries very
quickly I only have to sit there for
like 10 seconds and I can pop it on as
opposed to other eyelash adhesives it is
just great so house of lashes eyelash
adhesive I have a few lip products to
mention and the first one is a dose of
color lipstick in the shade of potion I
am very impressed by these lipsticks in
general they are so pigmented I like the
packaging I love that you can see the
exact color down here at the bottom of
the tube this color o gives me life just
look at that color honestly
are you kidding it is so so beautiful
these smell just like MAC lipsticks it
is just the perfect purpley pink color
super pigmented it's not frosty it's not
glittery it's super smooth and creamy it
honestly feels and smells exactly like
Mac it is just beautiful I love bright
colors like this in the spring and
summer you can do such a neutral eye you
can do a tinted moisturizer a little bit
of blush and a bright lip and it's just
awesome it's just a foolproof way to get
away with looking glamorous but not
having to try too hard and leave the
eyes and the rest of the face more blank
so love potion by dose of color love
another lip products that is right along
that same color line is maybelline color
elixir in the shade luxe in lilac I am
wearing this on my lips right now over
top of a pale pink lipstick I just love
these color elixirs in general they are
so smooth creamy buttery all you can
think of they are absolutely amazing I
love the little applicator and when it
goes on it has the perfect amount of
pigment I think because for a gloss I
personally don't like the gloss that is
too pigmented because then it can time
to kind of leave
read through the rest of your face and
not stay on the lips this feels more
like a lip butter it's very moisturizing
it's very creamy and it just has the
perfect Sheen to it there's no glitter
again in this it's just beautiful
this color can be worn by itself over a
lipstick mixed with a gloss I just
absolutely love this shade and it's a
great way to do that whole like orchid
fuchsia color that's so on-trend right
now without being overboard on the lips
it's a very mild version of that and
it's just beautiful I have another OCC
lip tar to mention I did mention one of
my last monthly favorites video I have
just been loving this all month this is
in the shade interlace and it is honest
to god the perfect nude it is so
beautiful OCC lip tars were created to
mix with other colors so other lipsticks
other glosses other lip tars and
honestly you are never going to run out
of this unless you are a professional
artists working on set with hundreds and
thousands of models you are not going to
run out of these honestly they the tiny
like this right here is enough for like
three or four lip applications I'm not
kidding so you can see what a beautiful
nude that comes out to it is perfect it
is honestly it should just be called
perfect it's perfect it's not too Brown
it's not too pink it's not too nude it
is perfect so I have won this by itself
many times I will also mix it with
anything so like I'll mix it with love
potion right now and you can see it'll
just take any color that you love and
transform it into a new so if you put on
or lip color and you're like this is
just a little too bright for me today
you can mix interlace with it and it's
just going to tone it down a bit it is
just absolutely beautiful I have mixed
this with pinks I have mixed it with
fuchsia I have mixed it with Reds I just
love this color it is gorgeous
so interlace by OCC this is my new
favorite blush for the summertime I am
so crazy about this blush you have no
idea it is by the brand Becca I have
been talking about backup for the past
couple of months and just raving about
their cheek products their blushes and
their highlighters are just off the wall
so this is in a shade flower child and
it is just amazing it is the most
beautiful pink color blush for the
summertime I can't get enough of it the
reason why I love it is because it has a
sheen
but it's not too much Sheen it also has
a little bit of coral in it but it's not
too much coral the reason why I say that
is because a lot of times girls who are
very warm in skin tone and have a little
bit of a tan can't pull off a babydoll
pink blush because it can make them
sometimes look too ashy or just not
complement their skin tone because it's
too cool and pink this color pink right
here is going to complement everybody
because it has a little bit of coral in
it but yet it's still a pink tone blush
so because it has the warmth and the
cool it turns out to the most beautiful
neutralized pink it is just gorgeous I
do have a little bit of this on my
cheeks today but I have it layered with
wild honey which is also by Becca which
is my other favorite blush by them it
has tiny tiny little gold flecks in it
which will just give you such a
beautiful glow in the summer
I'm telling you all around a flower
child by Becca is the perfect summer
blush I am super excited about this next
blush this is by MAC Cosmetics and this
is called modern Mandarin this has come
out a few times in limited edition
collections but it always goes away and
then just this last month they finally
made it permanent which I was so so
excited about because it is absolutely
gorgeous it is an orange blush but it
has a little bit of a pink undertone in
it just a little bit so it's not like a
true intense orange it kind of dilutes
the orange a little bit with a little
bit of pink in it this is a satin so
it's not a total matte via it doesn't
have shimmer in it it just has a
beautiful sheen so a predominantly
orange blush with a little bit of a pink
underlying background in it it is so
beautiful especially for the summertime
anyone who has a little bit of color in
their skin or even just a gorgeous dark
tan this is going to be so so pretty
it's gonna give you that glow from
within look it's just oh it's so
beautiful
these two blushes layered match made in
heaven
this is the Sigma fo5 small contour
brush I have been trying to find a brush
that I can contour with that is not any
NARS
eita brush because the NARS eda brush is
always sold out and people are having a
hard time finding it and then it comes
back and then it's gone so I've been
trying to find something that you guys
can put your hands on that it's gonna be
equally as amazing and so far the Sigma
fo5 is coming in as close as possible I
love this for many reasons first of all
the length of the
is amazing the density is so great for
blending it's not too fast it's not too
skinny and what I love is since its
rounded you're not gonna get a really
harsh paper cut contour like you can
sometimes get with the NARS eita I find
even if I originally go in with the NARS
brush and contour I'll end up dropping
it picking up this one and using this to
blend everything out because it just
makes everything look so airbrushed and
beautiful so the Sigma fo5 small contour
brush is gonna go to for my contouring
all month of May last but not least is
the tangle teezer
this has seriously saved my hair it is
such a godsend I love this thing so much
I just have this biggest issue with the
naughtiest tingly astaire you can
imagine I will brush my hair and it'll
be perfectly smooth I'll get in I'll
wash I'll condition I'll do it in a nice
mannered way I'm not doing it like a
freaking 8 and when I get out I'm like a
lion's mane it's just like a bird's nest
and there's times I'll be sitting there
working for 15 minutes on my knots and
I'm just like trying not to tear up and
cry because I'm just like going at it
this seriously it's like it's so amazing
it takes out your knots in 30 seconds I
got my hair trimmed to just earlier this
week and she busted this out and I was
like what is that um excuse me what is
that I need that right now do you sell
it here how much put it in the bag if
you have naturally tangy tangy hair
tangly hair knotty hair the tangle
teezer
tangle tangle tangle teezer is so
amazing worth every penny
it's just awesome for getting out knots
I've seriously had moments where I'm
like I'm ready to Kylie Jenner it and
just chop off my hair cuz I cannot deal
with that anymore this has saved the
frustration of my naughty hair so I'm
forever grateful for the tangle teezer
so that completes my bigger products for
