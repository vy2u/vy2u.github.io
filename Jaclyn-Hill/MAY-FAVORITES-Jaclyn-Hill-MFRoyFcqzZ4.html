my MA favorites
I can not believe but how fast time is
going don't like me if I look like a
total like sweaty mess right now it has
been a day I spent the afternoon at the
skate rink for my niece's 10th birthday
I cannot believe that's my first news
out of all three of them to hit double
digits in double digits that in age and
it is like freaking me out like I had a
moment the skate rink I was crying a
little bit with John I was like oh my
god I was there that she was born now
she's 10 I came in imagine how it feels
for the mom and dads out there like
watch my niece's grow up I'm like static
so that is not all this videos about but
anyways it's been a long day I was at
the skate rink and then I just have my
own private pool dance party for like
literally 30 or 40 minutes so I'm very
hyped up right now so I feel like I look
like a little bit of like a really
stupid version of pebbles to be honest
but it said with the short hair when I
get hot I want to put my hair off my
face but then this still has to hang
down so it's like my neck doesn't get
the relief but my face does so I like
having short hair but whoever said that
it's easier is lying to you
I'm just missed I think I have a lot to
talk about today like I said this is a
pretty hefty favourites video so let's
try to do this in less than 40 minutes
shall we grab a snack
just as precaution trust me you'll be
happy it's there grab a snack come right
back let's do this okay so the first
part I have are the Anastasia liquid
lips I'm gonna just say anastacio from
now on because I feel like you guys know
who I'm talking about I always say a
Nastasia Beverly Hills and I feel like
we can just drop the Beverly Hills here
you guys get who I'm referring to so
from here on out I'm just gonna call her
Anasazi so they came out with a bunch of
new liquid lip colors in their liquid
lip line I feel like it was the
beginning of April maybe and they did
send them to me as a PR package when I
open the box all backed up because there
were so many beautiful nudes not the
kind of news that pop up in your DMS no
thank you
so I am NOT a liquid lip person
naturally even though I think I talk
about them all the time I'm really not
on a day to day basis I want a lipstick
or a lip gloss I want something creamy
I'm not something Matt I do not what
something drying I do not want to
constant be looking in the mirror like
oh do i butt hole lips
oh is it cracking like when I put on a
gloss and lipstick I'd like
worried about I think about it like mama
doesn't have time to be dealing with
that on a day-to-day basis so I've had
moments of my liquid lips I love Kat Von
D's Lolita I had a hard core love affair
with that liquid lip for quite a while
but on a day-to-day basis it's just not
for me but these completely change the
way I've been wearing liquid lips so I
know I've heard some negative reviews on
the Anastasi liquid lips and I will say
they definitely are a thicker mousse ear
formula and the trick to them is you
have to like outline the lip the way you
typically would with the actual wand you
do not need to use a lip liner with
liquid lips especially these just
outline the lip do your thing and then
when it comes to the center of the lip
all you want to do is want to swipe
literally do not sit there and go just
because that's how it's gonna build up
just one swipe one swipe and you're done
and like that is the best way to wear
basically any liquid lip if it's a high
quality liquid lip and it's not dry and
it's got good even pigman in it one
swipe and you'll get the best where
basically the way we're wearing it
recently as I've been putting on one of
these two colors right here depending
when I'm in the mood for they're
extremely similar I'll swatch them for
you
um but I put it all over my lips and
then I'll go over top of it with a gloss
so I don't know why no-one has never
told me I've never even heard of anyone
like putting a gloss over their liquid
lip but you guys I am officially in love
it makes my nude lip last all day long I
feel like finally a nude lip it lasts
forever and is glossy like right it's
the best of both worlds so basically
what I do i line my entire outer lip one
swipe one swipe on the middle and then I
go in with any nude gloss I want overtop
now I don't sit there and rub my lips
back and forth because I'm sure if I did
that it might like ball up or chunk off
but just living my life talking drinking
hanging out whatever I may be doing my
lip stays like it looks right now for
hours and I'm just like so in love with
this so I am currently wearing the shade
and naked but this one right here is
called stripped and I go back and forth
between these two constantly strips I
feel like it's just a pinch darker on me
so when I have more of a tan I wear that
this is stripped right there and then
naked which is the one that I'm wearing
is just a pinch paler and a little bit
more like
oranjee if you want to say right there
and then I will go over it with a
product I'm about to talk about or I
will use Marc Jacobs sugar sugar which
is you guys my number one favorite gloss
in the entire world I don't know why I
don't own up two or three of them just
to throw like and all my purses in my
vanities cuz I swear like I don't leave
the house without sugar sugar it is my
favorite gloss in the world and I wear
that over this all the time but the past
like week or so I have been wearing this
constantly it morphe sex out a PR
package to the affiliates like super
duper early so a bunch of people got
these like way before they're launching
I believe they're five or six dollars
they're extremely expensive and these
are lip creams which is crazy because
like I've never seen more if you do
anything lip right I don't think so I
can get like a lip palate but like I've
never seen a gloss or a liquid lip or
anything like that so these are so
beautiful you guys like I can't even
tell you I don't really know what to
expect because I'm like okay you know
like let's see it has like this little
round head right here you know what it's
like five or six bucks and it's from
morphe a really inexpensive brand so I
didn't really know what to expect when I
first got my hands on it but like you
guys like look at this look at this like
if I spread it around look at this shine
and this gloss in this pigment it's
amazing like if this was sold at Sephora
for 16.99 I wouldn't even think about it
which is big yes this is amazing and I
wouldn't even hesitate I have been
loving this color so much this is what
I'm wearing right now I'm wearing a
Nastasia naked with the morphe color
blush lip cream over topic with each
other and I applied the lip cream with
this little baby brush this is the
morphe e39 sometimes most the time I
just take it and go directly on like
this I wear it by itself I wear over
liquid lips I wear over lipstick and I
love it it doesn't break up it doesn't
dry out it is such a high-end lip cream
it just feels so good and creamy on your
lips I'm super duper impressed by this I
love it thank you
ahh oh that just flew into my glove
oh my god it also vibrated when I was
trying to say is that I do have a
discount for morphe always it's just
Jack attack in all caps saves you 10%
but like you don't even need to use it
honestly because those are like so
wallet-friendly okay what shall we talk
about next I actually told you guys I
was gonna talk about this in my
favorites video so I might as well talk
about it now this is the Josie I don't
know if it's Marin or Marin because
everyone says it differently but I've so
say Josie Maran um Josie Maran vibrancy
foundation it is probably in my top 5
foundations of all time and I've only
owned it for like what three weeks maybe
a month it is ridiculously incredible so
the reason that I bought this is because
I have a couple friends at work at
Sephora my one friend Adrian texts mean
is like oh my gosh if we try the new
josie maran foundation it's amazing and
then my other friend Marissa attacks me
and was like oh my gosh have you tried
the new josie maran foundation it's
amazing and I was like no and no and one
of them is very dry and the other one is
extremely oily and I'll say this is
interesting that they're both telling me
that it's so good and one is super dry
and one is super oily and they're both
loving it sounds like this is kind of
interesting so that I picked it up I
bought it I actually just guessed my
color online it was a perfect map and
I'll click OK and this is the shade
adventurous g55 anyways this foundation
is so beautiful I don't even know how to
describe it it says vibrancy and that's
what it does it just makes your skin
have a glow and vibrancy but it doesn't
make you shimmery it doesn't make you
Glary it doesn't make you cake face like
it's just like the perfect amount of
medium to full coverage it looks so
natural on the skin it's so beautiful
and I just feel like I look luminous all
day long without looking like my face is
wet it doesn't get dry or cakey it
doesn't settle on my pores or like
little fine lines it is so beautiful I
can't begin to tell you it is my number
one right now know what kind of voodoo
magic is up in this bottle josie maran
but is amazing so now I'm going to talk
about a couple of eyeshadows that have
been added to my go-to eyeshadow
collection which is a very big deal for
me cuz I am such a picky little biatch
when it comes to my everyday eyeshadow
like neutrals that I run to like you
have to pass the test to be a part of
that palette there's an initiation
process so the first one is the shade
burnt orange by Anastasia and this is
because
one of my absolute must-haves can't live
without colors is so beautiful it's like
a medium tone warm matte brown I die for
this color oh my god next I have makeup
geek Morocco and oh my god I don't know
when this shade came out this could be
three years old for all I know but it's
new to me and my collection I just
discovered it like maybe a month and a
half ago or so and I can't live without
it now and I know these colors to be
really intimidating to a lot of people
because it is orange like it's a
straight terracotta orange but don't be
intimidated by these colors they make
your eyes pop and you don't have to use
it in a way where it's this orange on
your eyes like I wear this color all the
time and I bet you guys don't realize
that I'm wearing it because I'll do like
a nice soft brown and then I'll take
some of the burnt orange put that in my
crease and then so lightly on a brush
I'll just put the tip in there and tap
off the excess and then just go right
there in my upper crease area and all it
will do is just kind of brighten up the
look and bring a little pop of orange
but it won't be like wash orange on your
eyes and I'm saying so it's just really
beautiful especially this time of year
spring and summer coming up and let's
give that really beautiful pop and glow
that summer glow to your eyes I love it
guys
I love live breathed I sneeze alright so
next we have a highlighter by Jeffrey
Scott when I hold this up this just
looks so like mean like this highlight
is just such a baddie it's so big and
pink and just like bow like I don't
think you guys realize how big this is I
need to get a something to compare hold
on here is like a matte pressed powder
just like a normal-size and look at
Jeffrey stars like when I put this at
the very bottom with my thumb look at
how much bigger this is are you kidding
me this is insane and then this is huge
like I just think that is so freaking
dope like how big they are when I got
them in the mail I was a black bitch so
jeffree star cosmetics came out with
four different highlighters last week I
believe there were a couple different
shades and this one is by far the one
that stuck out to me and it is the shade
ice-cold this is just so different it's
so different which is what I love about
it
it is white so if you are like fair as
can be and you cannot find a highlight
that actually highlights you look no
further honey ice cold
it's right here it is so gorgeous I'm
wearing it today on my cheeks but I did
mix it with champagne pop because even
though I am extremely fair right now I
still felt as though it was just very
white on me and I wanted to bring in a
little bit of like that peachy champagne
e gold champagne pop has so I mix them
two together equally and then put it on
my cheeks but look look at this shape
look at that it's so different and it's
so pigmented and it's honestly you guys
the craziest formula ever when you touch
it it feels like it is cream it feels
moisturizing like it feels like there's
lotion and I don't have to explain it
it's just so buttery and moisturizing
like look at it blend it out on the skin
ah
I'm literally gonna show you guys what
champagne pop and ice-cold look like
mixed together because this is probably
going to be like my new favorite
combination for when I do not have spray
tan so I'm going to put ice cold the
back of my hand first high perfection
and now I'm going to put champagne pop
right over top of it like are you
freaking kidding me right now I'll show
you champagne pop by itself so you can
have like a reference so there's
champagne pop by itself and look at
champagne pop and ice cold combined mom
is not playing games I'm sorry if I just
gave you a heart attack
send me the hospital bill I have a
couple brushes I want to talk about
really quick I have two highlighting
brushes because I have been so obsessed
with highlight recently like coming out
with this collaboration with that gun
this highlighting palette my
highlighting game has been maybe a
little too strong at times but I've been
trying new brushes and new techniques in
new way of applying highlights and all
that jazz so I've been playing around
with different tools and this is the
morphe m51 0
I love the morphe M 501 and this is the
m5 1-0 it's kind of like mashed up but
anyways I tried this brush because Mandy
told me that I needed to he said that
it's his go-to ride-or-die so I was like
okay baby say no more um and I just love
this I was shocked by the fact that I
love the natural hair so much to apply
my highlight because I always use a
synthetic bristle but I just love this
and like looking through the distance I
just love this so much
it just goes on so smooth that I really
haven't
used the 501 recently I'm using the 510
instead I mean I still love the 501 but
that's just what happened like you love
something for six months and you find
something else you like buy the next one
is actually something that I feel like
no one would expect to highlight with
but I have been loving this and this is
again by morphe and this is the m500
like all the brushes I love to highlight
I'll start with five this one I love
because for obvious reasons it's very
big and very fat that's what she said I
am disgusting oh my god so this one I
like for a more subtle highlight so I
like dipping the powder obviously and
just go it's like very light stroking
motion that's obviously going to cover
more ground so if you want a more
precise highlight then you would just
kind of stay with a small brush and hit
those specific spots but like for
something in the summer time let's say
if you're doing like a really quick
bronzy beach look and you're just gonna
bronze your skin and do a little shadow
and some mascara and highlight a brush
like this would be ideal because you can
just grab some highlight and then just
lightly kind of sweep it all over the
face if you will just take a quick
little dust hit on your neck and your
dÃ©colletage and all that jazz and it's
I just love it I really love the way it
applies I used it in a video I believe
yes yes I did and I just really liked it
so I want to talk about these two body
washes and bubble baths that I have used
for years and years and years but for
some reason I just never talked about
them I am a huge bubble bath person I
love taking a hot bubble bath with
bubbles overflowing and candles look
everywhere and I put on Michael Buble
Pandora station and I just lay there and
zone out it is like my favorite thing
ever I need at least one bubble bath a
week where I can just sit there and soak
I put essential oils in my bath it is
just like it's my moment like John knows
it's my moment if the dogs start barking
he's like mommy taking a bubble bath
because it's like it's it's a very big
deal to me it's so relaxing and these
are the bubble baths and body washes
that I use when I take baths so this one
is called sleep and this one is called
stress relief and basically the whole
idea behind it it's like a Roma therapy
and it's supposed to help you with
stress and help you go to sleep so I
don't really know if it actually helps
me it's not like I use the sleep when
I'm like carrying me to bed like it
doesn't make you go to sleep or anything
like that but it's just like the scent
is just so oh when I smell it just makes
me feel like I'm there
like oh so peaceful the sleep one is
lavender chamomile and it is just so
amazing it just smells so relaxing and
then this one is stress relief and this
one is eucalyptus eucalyptus spearmint
so I use this morning basically as my
go-to body wash every day because let's
get real I'm stressed 100% of my life
and it smells so good this one is like
refreshing and like empowering and
smells like more like zesty and alive
whereas like the sleep one smells like
Oh like he was gonna be cradled like a
baby and rocked to sleep but I love them
both so much they smell so good after I
get out of the bath or the shower I can
smell it like overflowing it's my
hallway into my bedroom for hours and
I'm just like so good so my very last
favorite to wrap up this video is a
fashion accessory and this is a choker
necklace that I got from ASOS calm I
wore this when I was in New York City
