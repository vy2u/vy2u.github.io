doing my may favorites for you I am in a
different room in my house right now
this is my bedroom everything is going
to be different okay that lampshade is
crooked whatever everything is going to
be different in this room in about a
week or so I got all new bedding um so
it's gonna change but for right now this
is what we're working with so I think
it's funny like every single girl on
YouTube film sitting in front of their
beds so I feel so like unofficially
official right now so I'm just gonna go
ahead and jump into my products I feel
like I have tons of them but maybe it's
not that much oh God
getting hot and bothered just thinking
okay so I'm going to start off with
Josie Maran products I have a few of
them here if you don't watch my channel
all the time I am obsessed with her
products I think they are so amazing I
love that all her products have tons of
argan oil in it and you can use it all
in the face or the body I just think her
products are amazing so anyways the
first thing you want to talk about is
the Josie Maran Argan tinted moisturizer
this has an SPF 30 in it and I like this
because I've been spending a lot of time
outside recently and I like using this
as my sunscreen um just because I have
very very sensitive skin and even if I
buy sunscreen that's made for the face
my poor still get clogged and irritated
and it just drives my skin crazy so I
love this because I put it all over the
face and I use this as my SPF out in the
Sun and it is a 30 like I said so I just
love it it doesn't clog my pores it has
a very dewy finish I use my fingers and
I just blend it all around my face and I
put normal um SPF on my body and then I
go out and then next is it Josie Maran
Argan illuminizer I use this in my
bronze video that I did my bronze and
glowing makeup tutorial this is just
such a universal product Universal
versatile anyways you can use this for
so many things you can use this to prime
the base and then go over the foundation
with it you can mix it with your
foundation you can use it to highlight
the cheekbones you can use it on top of
makeup under makeup you can mix it in
with your body moisturizer and rub it
all over your skin
to give your whole body aglow it is
beautiful and just one pump will go a
really long way for you I love it
because it's not super bronzy and it's
not silver and it's not pink it's
literally the color of the illuminizer
is just like a perfect universal shade
where it's not gonna make you know
anyone look ashy or pink or silver it's
just a great great tone okay another
product by Josie Maran is her argon
infinity cream this is her intensive
creamy oil I have owned this for I would
say I don't know about four months and
I've liked it the whole time but
recently I have been loving it I put it
on you can use anywhere on your entire
body you can use it for anything that's
what's so awesome about her products is
they're all-natural so they're
multi-purpose and you can use them
anywhere in your body that you feel like
you need it so I love using this on my
face at night before I go to bed my
skincare routine has changed so much
since my last video I really think I new
need to do an updated one but um with
that being said I just love using this
all over the face I use it on my elbows
these are my shoulders any time I'm
feeling dry in any area I get really dry
on my chest area so I put it wherever
I'm feeling dry and my skin just soaks
it up I love this product last thing by
her I love is it's so cute it's her
Argan lip treatment it looks like a
little bottle of potion it is so
adorable and you take the top off if I
can get it off okay there we go
and it just looks like this and it
smells like strawberries and cream huh
this one's at the checkout line at
Sephora you can get all of her products
there that's where I purchased mine and
it was just sitting there the checkout
line and I was like oh my god you're so
cute and I had to own it and it's
amazing next to my cheek Ellie and
sweaty
wanna turn my air and you're here in the
camera okay so the first cheek product I
want to talk about is the baked blush by
Milani called Luminess oh it is the most
beautiful like Coralie all-over cheek
color it is so pretty it reminds me of a
color that Mac had it was limited
edition called utterly game it was like
two or three years old and I have it
still cuz I love it so much but this is
so similar I actually like using this
blush with a white goat hair brush to
apply instead of like a Mac 129 where
it's a synthetic brush I like using this
with a natural hair brush because I
think that it just makes it look so
flawless on the cheeks and it's very
rare that I feel like that about a blush
but I feel like this one goes very well
with the white angled cheek blush brush
so I just love love blush you think it
looks beautiful it's very natural and
very subtle okay and then next I said to
tell you guys that I love you so much
because if it wasn't for you I would not
have this and you guys are so amazing
your recommendations seriously rock my
socks off so this is Bobby Brown's
shimmer brick and nectar I showed in my
haul that I got the bronze and so many
of you told me to go out and get nectar
and um I went to Sephora and I asked
them for nectar and I was like I don't
see and they're like oh there's no such
thing and then I was like my subscribers
aren't liars so then I walked Nordstrom
and I was like um do you guys have a
shimmer connector and they were like yes
we do and I was like that's what I
thought it is absolutely beautiful I
have it on my cheeks today oh man this
lighting is making my cheeks look insane
whatever you can use as a blush or over
top of a blush you can also use the
lighter side just for some highlight on
the top of the cheeks but beautiful too
highlights I'm going to talk about
something expensive again this is the
Dior highlights this is what is this
this is the amber amber diamond shimmer
powder oh my gosh I love this once again
I bought this because all of you guys
were telling me this
the best highlighter ever and I need it
in my life you were right it is
absolutely beautiful it I was nervous
about this color right here there's like
a rose gold thick color right there in
the center you can see I was nervous
about that because that could easily
look very muddy but it does not look
money it is absolutely beautiful I love
it I have it on the very tops of my
cheeks just a tiny tiny bit over top of
that nectar I love this thank you so
much for telling me about it I can't
stop it is amazing and I feel like the
Tanner that you are the prettier that's
gonna look because when I first got it
and I was really fair I was like four
shades lighter than I am now um yeah it
didn't look as good now that I'm getting
more color it's looking better and
better so I've talked about this a
million times before I use it all the
time but I am just so in love with this
in this last month okay sorry I gotta
get Indian style here this weekend I
actually went out of town on location to
do a photo shoot and I was gone for
three days and I was working on tons of
different models you know variety of
skin tones and skin types and I just
have to say that overall the mary-lou
manizer by the balm was hands-down the
best
highlighter to have there I mean like it
worked on everybody just a tiny bit it
goes such a long way this is not a
highlighter you can dip your brush in
and go crazy it is like insane it has
more pigmentation in it the NARS
albatross and if you're familiar with
that one it is pigmented so it is
absolutely beautiful but you have to be
careful because it is intense but love
this you can see how pigmented it is
like a couple swipes and it's white so
you can see that highlight it is so
pretty though but pigmented once again
I'm going to talk about lip products I
have to say I have been loving more than
anything this month the Kardashian
chroma Beauty line and the joy sticks
these are so amazing I'm wearing them
right now I'm actually wearing these too
right now I have a bunch of colors I
think I have 4 or 5 of them I love these
two colors together though it's like a
nice nude pink color this one right here
is baby doll
I have this on my lips looks like that
they are so creamy I absolutely love the
way they smell
they smell like candy I can't get enough
of them and then this one actually like
a double sided one it has like a weird
lip liner on this side that's shaped
very odd and then the joystick is on
this side and this one actually came I
showed it in my hall in a nude lip kit
with a gloss the name of this is in the
nude you can see that one right there
next to it I just love these color they
are so pigmented it doesn't say anything
about than being long-lasting but they
last forever I am in love with makeup
geek eyeshadows umm I've only purchased
four of them I'm not super crazy about
two of them but that's okay because I
couldn't see them online
um but creme brulee I cannot get enough
of it is the most gorgeous brown
eyeshadow and you know I'm obsessed with
warm Browns this is so much like Mac's
texture eyeshadow but with even like
more of a pop um it's matte though it
does not have any shimmer in it but it's
just this beautiful warm reddish brown
it is so pretty the other eyeshadow that
I'm in love with is Coco bear this is
also by makeup geek this is very similar
to brown script by Mac or Swiss
chocolate actually I would say more like
Swiss chocolate
yeah looks like that right there it has
more red in it so once again it's just a
dark warm red I love this color I love
this color especially to blend out the I
can't talk to blend out the eyeshadow on
the lower lash line I think it's really
beautiful I love warm Browns under the
eyes it makes your eyes just pop I'm
gonna give a quick shout out to this
Sedona lace fan brush this is the fan
brush oh one I'm assuming that's what FB
stands for is fan brush I've seen a
couple of girls talk about this here on
YouTube I had to get it because I just
love it so much and I used to own a
brush similar to this but not as big and
I used to really like it so this is made
for highlighting
so you just use on the cheekbones right
in here so you dip it in your
highlighter and then you just highlight
right in this area and it just gives you
a really soft blown out highlights so
that it's not like harsh nexuses
foundation this is the Revlon Colorstay
whipped foundation I have the color 320
it is a little too light for me right
now I have to go to the drugstore later
today and get my smell everything and
get a shade darker but I was shade 320
warm golden and that's when I was about
an NC 25 at Mac's it is such a great
foundation it seriously lasts all day
long it gets better and prettier
throughout the day um I would definitely
recommend this for oily skin I am dry
and it definitely feels dry I have to
really moisturize before applying and I
have to like douse myself and
moisturizing setting spray like mac fix+
throughout the day because it does feel
dry on the skin if your oily though this
is a match made in heaven it says it
lasts for 24 hours and I actually
believe it it is beautiful I would
recommend this to any bride on the face
of the earth this is an awesome
foundation alright next is a brush
cleaner this is a professional makeup
brush cleaner it's called harrion spirit
I've never known how to pronounce this
exactly parry and spirit I'm assuming
whatever all I know it's amazing I had a
brand new bottle of it before I left and
that is a lot of brush cleaner to use in
just three days that's what I went
through I also went through a little
mini spray bottle of it it's just an
awesome brush cleaner it cleans your
brushes so quickly and it says this
environmentally safe revolutionary
product cleans conditions and disinfect
your brushes after used with me after
use with makeup and or adhesives
contains citrus based spirits so it
smells like straight oranges it smells
so good and it cleans your brushes so
quickly and so deep I love it this is
the best brush cleaner I've ever used I
recommend it to everybody ok Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray the only
complaint I have about the spray is the
packaging gets filthy like you can see
there's makeup all over it from me
grabbing all the time with me
on my hands to set people's makeup but
this is such an awesome spray I've used
it on oily and dry people it is oil free
the difference between the girls I use
this on and didn't it was a very big
difference the girls I wouldn't use on
in the heat and humidity their
foundation would settle here
and the girls I did use it on wouldn't
have that happen for at least three or
four hours so yeah this is a great great
setting spray forever red this is a new
fragrance by Bath &amp;amp; Body Works um once
again when I was out of town doing
makeup one of the models sat down and
she smelled so good I would not stop
talking to her about how she smelled I
think I kind of freaked her out
um that I was going on and on and on
about how she smell and I just kept
getting more whiffs of it and she pulled
out of her purse and she told me that it
was this so I ran out to Bath and Body
Works and I got a miniature wine just
because I didn't know if it was gonna go
well with my body so I am obsessed it
smells so good it has the power perfume
hold on I've literally gagging we're
gonna rewind two lip products really
quick I just want to say that neon red
which is from Maybelline Maybelline
vivid collection absolutely beautiful I
was wearing this in my question and
answer video and so many of you guys
were asking me what color I was wearing
I was wearing this with a NYX lip liner
I believe the lip liner is called hot
red so I love this neon red it's gotten
a little bit of a warmer orangie
undertone I think it's beautiful it's
not completely matte which I like for
the summertime so yeah I really really
like this red also this is hands-down my
favorite lip product of the month the
winner goes to NARS Chelsea girl Chelsea
girls comes in a little pot like this
and it's just this nude color Kim
Kardashian actually wore this a couple
of times and so that was like a big
selling point for it um I don't care
though but it is beautiful when I worked
at Nordstrom and I was a little bit more
fair it didn't look very good on me but
now that I have color of my skin I love
it I'm wearing it today overtop of these
two Kardashian joysticks I was telling
you about yeah I've got
happening on this face today judge me
two things are stud earrings I have been
I've always been in love with studs
I love studs if you notice I either wear
stud small earrings like this or I wear
big hoops that's just me and I usually
prefer something dainty on my neckline
that's just what I'm comfortable with
but recently I have been in love these
Kate Spade earrings these are Kate
Spade's right here I'll show you them
they're just small very sparkly and they
have a gold trimming on the outside and
then these right here are also Kate
Spade and they are big and blingy and I
love them I purchased these both from
Nordstrom they've been there for a very
long time I just absolutely love studs
especially in the summertime when you
have your hair pulled back in a ponytail
I just love the way small studs look I
think that even if you don't have any
makeup on and you're not looking cute
small studs will add just a touch of
girliness to your look so I love them I
have gotten so many questions about
these sunglasses on I posted a picture
on Instagram of me wearing these in a
different color I have them in okay
honestly I love like Willy Wonka nor
Chum in the BP juniors department they
are only ten dollars they're super cheap
I have them in this black and then also
in like a tan warm beige color so yeah
they're really comfortable I like buying
expense inexpensive sunglasses in the
summer time because they're going to be
trucked all around the place the pool
and the beach and they're going to be
covered in sunscreen and sand so yes I
like to invest in lots of and expensive
sunglasses okay so that is everything I
hope you guys enjoy my may favorites
video and let me know what your
favorites are down below you guys give
the best recommendations ever I love you
forever and I will see you soon mmm bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
