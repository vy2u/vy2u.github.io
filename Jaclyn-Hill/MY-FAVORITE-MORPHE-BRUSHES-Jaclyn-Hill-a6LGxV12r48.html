trying so hard to get better and not
screaming if you guys on camera it's so
hard like guys always take my voice back
down and then within 20 seconds like I'm
right back up here literally when I edit
my own videos I get annoyed with myself
but I talk to myself while I'm
editing me I'm like stop being so
annoying stop screaming it this is not
an easy situation to edit at the Hamer I
am so excited to be doing today's video
like I know I said it basically in every
single video but I'm especially excited
for today's video because I have been
working on this one for a while now
about time to go Linda and I were
sitting down going over some details
with the Jaclyn hill palette we're
calling it back the palette I'm creating
with more feet there that's more like it
and I just casually brought up in
conversation I was going to be filming
and updated like favorite and morphe
brush videos soon because this video is
just a very consistently requested video
I see a request for about every single
day just people asking for an updated
version people ask me what my favorite
bundle is from morphe so on and so for i
have gotten so much more familiar with a
brand and with the brushes and I have
now got to go to their source several
times and really like take my time and
touch and feel and get to know their
brushes so now like these brushes are my
homies right they're a part of me so
anyways we were sitting there I told
Linda like oh yeah I'm going to be
something updating what we brush videos
soon and she was like oh my gosh why did
tell me we should do something to make
it really special for your subscribers
and I was like really my quiet
I'm opening so access video goes live
there's going to be like a Jacqueline
section on morphe brushes calm where all
my favorite brushes are going to list
you guys can see all my fur brushes and
then sorry I'm getting lipstick on my
piece and then what those brushes are
used for exactly just to kind of break
it down for you and now on top of that
what they are doing which is so awesome
and I'm so just excited and grateful for
morphe doing this because one of the
most asked questions I get from you guys
about brushes is what my favorite brush
kit is people are always treating me
acne on YouTube and Instagram with your
favorite morphe kit I want to buy a kit
I'm very confused by individual brushes
it doesn't make sense to me like I just
want to buy a kit and I get it it is
easy right like it comes together it's
all there you want to think about it so
I have a total
23 brushes in front of me right now I'm
going to be talking about in today's
video I have several face brushes and
several eye brushes and then once this
video goes live they will be sold in a
kit as one big bundle for a very
discounted price and they're going to be
giving you guys an exclusive 15% off
discount so that is going to last for
only five days that code is going to be
eligible in store in Burbank California
and it will be eligible online you can
use it as many times as you want for
whatever you want
not just this brush kit and not just
these brushes but anything that morphe
sells this brush bundle will come in at
my favorite brush taste you guys know
I've been reading about this case ever
since I discovered it maybe a year ago a
year and a half ago or so it is a hard
case that will set crocodile I love it
so much that I love animal print open it
up and there are all your brushes right
there it can just sit nice and flat on
our vanity a desk or a floor because
that's where I always do my makeup when
I travel is the floor and then when
you're done you just shut it and it's
magnetic so it's just just like this the
reason I love this so much is because of
the fact that it is a hard case because
I always just travel with my brushes and
a brush roll or in a ziplock bag just to
make it easy but what will happen is
when I get there I unpack my suitcase
the bristle will be like to mess up
sometimes and deformed and I never
really go back to their regular shapes
to smush into a suitcase like the
bristles will get messed up where this
is a hard case so everything is so
protected not to mention this case holds
a generous amount of rushes this bundle
that I'm talking about right now you
guys it's also going to be available in
the store and the 15% discount over the
next five days will also be eligible in
the store and then keep in mind and five
days and that 15% discount code is
expired
there still is just my regular 10%
discount code that I always have which
is Jack Attack in all caps but it's a
superset just a little something extra
wholesome Safi okay guys let's jump in
to my favorite brushes I have been
divided up into space and I and reserve
the space first I think that makes more
sense
I watched them all last night that way
they weren't dirty disgusting on camera
but I did do my makeup
earlier this morning so view them are
dirty again
I just got to kind of move along in
order that you do your makeup right into
service foundation so you guys already
know my favorite foundation brush is the
m4 39.3 nine is it such a good
foundation brush I use it all the time
this is always the brush that I fall
back on you guys know I'm talking about
you have those things with yourself you
know whether it's a highlight a blush
brush whatever it is there's just
certain things that our writer guys
that's the foundation brush for me at
the end of the day everyone for my news
I'm Christian the best foundation brush
I love it so much I love that it's
rounded I love the way it blend that my
foundation it gives such a great full
coverage and it is soft on your face
it's not scratchy whatsoever all the
brushes I'm talking about here today are
not scratchy they're all very soft and
feels very high-quality this brush was a
more recent discovery for me I was
actually on set shooting with more heat
for my palette and Nicole also known as
a lipstick NIC on social media did my
makeup that day and I was so excited I
can't wait for the Signet beatdown it
was so much fun but she was using this
brush to blend my foundation and all I
saw what are you doing why are you than
that what's the purpose like I just sew
into it you know like anything my seat's
makeup artist working like I can't take
my eyes off of it I want to know
everything about everything that you're
doing she just told me she goes I love
using a smaller more precise synthetic
brush for foundation I feel like it
really gets into all the little lines
and crevices you can get a really full
coverage you can really like determine
where you're going to put the majority
of the coverage you have more control
and I was like so now I go back and
forth between an e 8 &amp;amp; M 4 3 9 I just
love the round top that's the thing it's
like I look for the most I used to love
flat tops but that's because I had not
discovered round tops yet so round top
synthetic brushes are definitely my
favorite brushes to apply foundation
with I just like I can really maneuver
the product I really really like this
small brush I will say here in a hurry
you're just going to want to use the big
guy because this one will take longer of
course it's smaller ad for a powder
brush this right here is the only one by
morphe that I truly love I mean those
are the ones that I like but this is
like my absolute go to it is the best
hands down this is the e for you want
whenever they're going to E and
the number that means it from the elite
collection which makes it more of a
luxurious more expensive line I love the
Ely collections so much did the brickles
are just so soft and it just feels so
high and these are just like pure luxury
if you ask me I love this brush because
it is so big so fast dense facile sheet
set truly when I cut my power I feel
like it is still faster guy you see a
more smaller brush back in the day and
it just took so long and now that's done
this bronzer brush you guys you guys
this is a serious moment okay you know
how dedicated I was my contour bronzer
brush oh my god I remember saying like
yes this morphe brush might be good yes
this is what brush might be goes but
nothing compared to Thomas for bronzer
brush like it is the only thing I use
always and people get so frustrated me
all my videos they get faster than that
hundred dollar brush Malevich didn't
care that nothing blended out my bronzer
like that contour brush and it has
actually been replaced like for real
like for real so this is a more feet are
choose from the rose gold collection I
love the way these brushes look with
that rose gold ferrule and this matte
black handle I think it is like just so
sexy looking if you watched my videos
you see me use this bronzer brush every
single time I apply at the perfect size
not too big and it's not too small like
it's big enough where it's not going to
contour you but it's small enough where
it's not going to over brawn you and
make it messy it's so soft I love the
way the bristles are shorter on the edge
and then laundering the center because
it gives you such a beautiful just
smooth bronze application like I just I
love this the only brush I use honestly
like I'm obsessed
so speaking of contour my go-to brush is
definitely the ar-10 and Frankie has
some follow this brush in the edges all
chewed up by hand but I don't care I
still use it this brush right here makes
contouring so easy and I noticed all you
guys use brushes that seriously this
contour brush is so beautiful
I don't even know what they actually
created this brush for but it is like
the perfect contour brush and I would
never saw it until I used it and it's
because the bristles are not the perfect
height to contour they're not too short
and they're not extra-long I also love
how the top of the brush the bristles
are a little bit longer and they're
shorter on the side so when you contour
it just create such a nice soft blended
out
smooth line you're not going to like a
really harsh line with this because
there's other brushes I have used in the
past at the NARS eita brush which I love
that brush but you also have to be
careful like I have to be careful anyone
who used it have to be careful because
you have you can easily create a very
intense with line if you're not using
the perfect contour shade it's not going
to look right whereas this is just very
smooth very natural-looking contour it
truly looks like a shadow and not a line
which is why I love it I have also used
this brush a lot for contouring which
you have seen on camera but I actually
prefer this one for blush a little bit
more and this is the m5 3-0 this brush
is actually the most universal a lot of
all the ones I am talking about because
this brush I will use for three
different things I will use it for
contouring I will use it for blush i
will also use it to wipe away any time I
bake I know nothing silly like oh you
can use any brush for that yeah you can
but this is just one I always pick up
the guys like the way it likes a way to
transmit powder I think it looks really
nice I wanted to add this guy in here
because it is similar to this one in the
sense that you can use it for blush or
contour but it's different because it's
shorter and denser so if you want to go
in and really precise and like really
make that contour like stand out and pop
which is more like an evening look that
I will do so I'll go in with this brush
originally I'll do my contour I'll dab
this a little bit into that conversate
and then I'll just go right in that area
just right there it's the perfect brush
for that just for deepening up and
intensify your contour this used to be
easy contour brushes you guys remember
back in the day like this is a brush
that everyone used for contour like it
was the only thing next we have the N
for 3/8 and this is actually fresh out
of the packaging like brand new because
I was looking for it this morning and I
cannot find it anywhere I swear it like
rolled away yesterday I was cleaning my
brushes so I had two backups in my
drawer thank goodness so this is what it
looks like when it comes brand new
brushes always look so different when
you first get them out of the packaging
right like after you use them wash
multiple times they're just better I
don't know they just get better as you
use them but anyways you guys can use
this brush all the time this is what I
will use to put powder on my under-eye
it doesn't matter if I'm using a powder
for brightness
face powder this is a brush I will use
to put it under there too because I love
how soft these natural bristles are to
find it really nice and smooth and
evenly the m5 10a ka v highlighting
brush I mean it's a the best
highlighting brush because that how but
it is just the highlighting brush I'm
pretty sure that this is the
highlighting brush I think every single
youtuber out there using it justified
your highlight so smooth because of use
natural bristled like everything just
goes on it glides like it is the only
highlighting brush that I have used
since I discovered I think like any time
I use a different one of my visits to
Twitter I grab this one because it's
just the best so you are hiding clean
the N 510 is your brush
alright let's move on to the eye brushes
so all my new blending brushes of course
you know me my eye huh does not blend it
out I'm going to wash my face like
everything needs to be blended to
perfection at all times and so you're
going to get a lot of blending brushes I
parked there off with the most Awkward
one of all just because it's not even
technically an eye brush guys when I'm
talking about an eye category because
that's where I use it this is the e47
and it's just so cute you're looking
like it's just kind of weird and
different you can use this to contour
your nose which I've done several times
and it works great for contouring your
nose but the thing that I actually use
it for is I dip it in translucent powder
and I'm use it to clean up my eyeshadow
I just stamp it right there I'll do my
foundation my concealer my powder and
I'll do my eyeshadow make my I shall get
sloppy at all I just didn't translucent
and just clean it away and I'm good to
go
e18 is this is the best pencil brush
effort like I don't know what if I feel
like my whole life all types of brushes
have always been the same there's other
is the same like I've always had the Mac
pencil brush at all they're just the
same this one is not the same there's
something so different about this is so
soft it passwords so much product just
makes it blend out so smooth and evenly
like this is the only pencil brush that
I truly use anymore cuz it just get
under there so nice and tight I don't
know this is just honestly hard to
explain because it just seems like if
the pencil brush like what's the big
deal but once you use it you'll
understand it's the best pencil brush
this is bomb this is the M 4 3 2 and I
literally do not know how to live about
this
I mean that's traumatic I'm sure we'll
figure it out my life would go on would
be difficult I use this brush for two
different things and I'm telling you if
I wear those brushes it can't be
replaced like sometimes okay I don't
have this brush I can make it work with
a different one no no no and this is the
only brush is going to do its job and
what I use this brush for is to get that
color really tight on my lower lash line
I'll also use this take shadow and put
it actually on my waterline I need to
like really make my waterline a lot
blacker or I want the eyeliner to last
longer throughout the day I'll just
stamp over my waterline I also set my
eyeliner with shadow using this and I
will buff my eyeliner out with us if you
need to that technique several times in
my videos where I will be like a dark
brown or a black on this exact brush and
also blend out my eyeliner to make it
nice and smoky so this is a definite
like 100 percent must for me when it
comes to doing my eyeshadow even I'm
doing a really simple look I still pick
this brush up no matter what this is the
N 2 1 3 and it is so what tiny Bice
where the tiny brushes are is the most
important one so this one is needed for
an inner corner highlight but I like to
use it for a little brow bone pop like
especially as that makeup forever
Scarlett power that I use I will take
this brush and dab it barely in there I
just go Google just for like a tiny
little bright highlight right there on
the top of the brow bone this is my
go-to brush for the inner corner of the
eye and this is the e36 this is what I
basically always be pretty in a corner
of my eye just to highlight right there
I swear a couple years back I didn't
have like any of these really small
precise makeup brushes I don't even know
how I did my makeup like I said a small
one or sometimes the most important all
right let's get into blending brushes I
have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 different
blending brushes because that's how
important it is to me first off we have
the M 506 this is a new discovery for me
and when I say new I'm talking like in
the past couple months you know maybe
like four months ago I discovered this
and I love it I can't put it down first
of all you are someone who likes to do a
cut crease a soft cut crease the harsh
cut crease it doesn't matter here is a
cut crease like this brush is incredible
because of the fact that it is so tiny
and precise you can get in there and
blend out a cut crease so easily I also
use this a lot if I'm smoking out my
lashline
I felt like a little bit like a cat I I
would go in use it and just smoke out
that outer corner it's just so tiny and
precise like I love how short and little
paper the bristles are just makes
everything so easy they even use it on
the lower lash line of your I can blend
out your lower lash line as well because
it's just so small and precise this is
the e17 now this brush is a very
different type of blending brush
compared to like a really fluffy one you
can't really see the difference on
camera but this one is more of a stiffer
blending brush which in the past I've
always kind of liked against stiffer
blending brushes so my how am I supposed
to blend something out with a stiff
brush now the brush isn't stiff this
like it has movement to a mobility it's
just not like all of the hairs aren't
going to go all different directions
when you touch it to your skin like the
hair it all stay compact and together
which the reason I loved it is if I
really want to pack on a color really
intensely in the crease area on the
outer corner this is a guy that I will
pick up dip in my shadow and go in there
and it just keeps it nice and precise
and tight and I will grab a different
brush to go in and blend that color
outward but this just gets on so much
pigment right where you need it this is
the M 504 and I use this for two
different things the first one is I'm
doing a matte wash of color all over my
eyes at a really fast day because when I
do my makeup really fast let's say I
really have like five to kind of message
my makeup what I would do is I was spot
conceal with concealer of course I will
do a little bit of cream bronzer gloss
I'll curl my lashes and I'll take any
broader like I don't know why I always
use bronzer any bronzer I pick it up on
this brush I'm doing this right in my
crease area just like so sloppy and so
messy and this is the brush that I use
for that because I just think that it
applies a matte color all over the lid
so beautifully so effortlessly and
because it is big I could get the job
done so fast that is definitely what she
said so now the part that I'm most
excited for we're going to talk about
all these white hair and blending
brushes because the last brushes here in
this video we have six of them right
here in
and now for someone who's gonna walk
into a store and CD sitting there you're
going to think I don't need all six oh
those like what's the point they all
seem that same right wrong I seriously
need all six of these blending brushes I
don't care if that makes me high
maintenance it is the key to blending
out your eyeshadow having a perfect
beautiful smokey eye how do you need
alpha city for an everyday look No
so you don't pursue these today right in
my makeup no as you can see three of
them are dirty this one this one this
one that's what I use for today's
eyelids which is very simple I only
three eyeshadows today and they were all
matte but when it comes time to
incorporating darker colors pops of
color blending out things like black
having away smokier eye introducing more
than just two or three eyeshadows all
six of these brushes have a purpose and
once you have them you'll be like why'd
I ever live without them the first
question I pick up every single time I
do my eyeshadow no matter what I do it
to look like today but you look weird
basically it's like one shadow if it's
tons of shadows I always start off with
this brush right here this is from the
rose gold collection and it is our 37th
hard for me to read it because the
numbers are very worn off but the reason
I think this up first is because it is
just the best at putting down a very
light wash of color in the transition
area which is the key to blending out a
shadow now if you want to really pack on
some beautiful color and blend it out
this would not be your brush is going to
be a little bit too long and make it a
little messy but for that first wash of
color the transition area it's perfect
next we have the m51 3 which is going to
look very similar to the other brush I
just showed you because it is so similar
the only difference is it is just
smaller and more compact but this brush
is so great we're going in with the
second color on your eyes so like today
I went with this one first and then I
picked up this one second just to bring
in that darker color a little bit lower
this one just works so nicely when you
want to get a little bit more precise in
that crease area now we have the m5 1/8
and the difference between Tiffany other
bristles is that this is more of just a
dull or the other one had a longer hair
in the top and shorter on the side this
one is basically goes up and just goes
perfectly around which makes this brush
amazing for going back and forth and
windshield wiper motions if you want to
have a nice deep color and really just
carve out the crease area this is going
to be perfect for that now what you want
to go in circular motions really blend
stuff out I wouldn't go with this brush
I would
the others I've been showing you but
this one is just amazing for that
precision of really packing on a color
which wiper motions now we have the m4
for one which is so similar to the first
blending brush that I showed you the r37
but I wanted to include this in here
because I use both of them all the time
together in the same look because if I
go in with a transition color with this
one and I'm blending out everything and
I'm blending blending money and I want
to go in with a different color I don't
want to mix those colors in the same
brush so having both of these that are
so similar work out my advantage very
often so I wanted to add it in here that
you guys could have that option as well
because some kind of having two brushes
they're basically the same
it's a good thing when you're working
otherwise you're like crap like I said
clean this brush is not working it's not
blending out properly there's other
colors on it you know what I mean this
is the N 5 7 3 and this brush I always
use putting a generous amount of matte
shadow and just blending it out so
effortlessly because of its size like
it's nice and fat and then of course is
the longer the top shorter on the side
so it's going to blend out such a
generous amount so quickly so this is
the brush that you would pick up if you
have to just throw on one color and run
out the door it's similar to the one I
showed you earlier the black haired one
which is synthetic and this is the m50
for the difference is this one is more
short and compact to wear this one truly
is huge so just particle preference
people larger live space if you want to
apply more color at that time maybe you
like this one to blend out after use
this once you apply you kind of get the
rhythm the motion of the ocean kind of
figure it out as you go last but
certainly not least I saved the best one
for last I'm pretty sure this is the
most popular blending brush by morphe
and is the m43 the reason of the present
you guys see all over social media so
many youtubers are using it it is just
the blending brush because of its short
density and its width it's just so great
for packing on any dark color right here
in that outer corner then I will pick up
one of these other brushes and start to
blend that out you guys see this process
on camera all the time I'm still
supplying you guys because in depth
try to make more sense but this one is
definitely a cannot live without
blending brush like half
this that is a guide all 23 brushes laid
out for you I really hope that you enjoy
this video especially for those of you
who feel very overwhelmed by brushes and
very confused trust me I understand the
first time I ever went to the morphe
store I was like oh my god like even ask
someone who loves and understands
brushes and makeup and like it's my life
literally I was still overwhelmed all
that Wow like they have hundreds of
brushes it's like brush heaven so
hopefully it's kind of breaks it down
for you guys and Mason spend out of it
and the fact that morphe is putting all
of these into a bundle for a discounted
price I think it's so amazing because
thank you to morphe so much for doing
that for me and for you guys don't
forget that there is that fifteen
percent off discount code that it's only
going to last for five days I will put
all of the information from everything
that has talked about with this video in
the description box right below and I
will also probably share on snapchat and
possibly Instagram we'll see and don't
forget that everything is happening here
is also happening in the store in
Burbank as well as online so that's it I
love you guys I'm done thank you so much
for watching and I will see my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
