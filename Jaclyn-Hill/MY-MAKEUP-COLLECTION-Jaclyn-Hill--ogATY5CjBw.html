one of the most highly requested videos
here on my channel it is my makeup
collection video as you can tell by the
title I just want to say before getting
started that I am in no way trying to
brag whatsoever by showing you the
amount of makeup that I have please keep
in mind that this is my profession I am
a makeup artist and some of these things
like brushes and eyeshadows I have owned
for seven to eight years so this is
definitely a long process of
accumulating different makeup also a lot
of the Mac products that you're going to
be seeing I did get for free because I
worked for the company for four years so
yes with that being said I'm super
excited to do this video for you guys
and I hope you enjoy let's go so this is
the overview of my makeup section this
desk right here is where I sit and do my
makeup on a daily basis so all of my
products that I use on a daily weekly
basis are all in that desk right there
and then this dresser over here to the
left this is where I keep stuff that I
still love still used but not every
single day because I just keep
everything here that are like my
favorites or my most recently purchased
things things I'm loving right now for
the season and as for the desk itself I
get so many questions about it and it
actually is an antique piece I restored
it myself I sanded it down and painted
it an off-white color and then I
repaired the drawers and then went out
and got new hardware which I believe the
hardware is from Lowe's that I put on um
it was only 40 dollars when I got it
like out of the back of someone's garage
it was supposed to be temporary you know
and then two years later so my lamp
right here this is from home goods my
mirror is so old I can't even honestly
tell you where it's from I like it
though because it's super short I have
like a prettier taller one that my
husband got me but I don't use it
because it doesn't work when I'm filming
it's too tall over the camera so I use
that one right there I have no idea
where it was I'm sure it was cheap I've
owned it for like five years and then my
brushes these are my day-to-day brushes
right here these are my personal brushes
I only use for myself and not on any
clients in my freelance kit so I have
three different containers and these
containers are from the Container Store
they're little like
tin jars and when I got them they were a
white like creamy
I don't know kinda like a yellowy beige
color so I just sprayed
the metallic silver I have three
different bins which is very excessive
and not you don't need that many brushes
but I have to face areas and then I have
this one which is eyes and then some
overflow face
most of these are Sigma and I think I
have like this is Sedona lace this is
real techniques for the most part
they're all Sigma brushes though to the
left of my mirror I have my Muji five

things that I absolutely love normally

L'Oreal Revlon a lot a lot of Mac just
all miscellaneous things this is RiRi
brew button by Mac Rihanna's look sick I
just have a second of it I actually
ordered tuned I didn't mean to so little
skies let showed up and here on the Left
we have lip glosses or lip balms
anything moisturizing I know this
doesn't seem super organized but in my
mind I know what I own so when I open up
the store I'm opening it for a certain
color so
I know it's in here second drawer we
have more foundations and these are in
here for either they're too light for me
too dark for me or they just stopped
working with my skin or maybe they broke
me out or maybe I don't like the texture
right now but they're sitting in here
because I'm not like officially I hate
you but I'm not crazy about it at the
moment right there in the middle are the
rest of my concealers I have L'Oreal
magic Lumi the bomb - gone yeas to
select cover-up by Mac a L'Oreal each
pearl Sam a concealer and then Studio
sculpt by Mac and then right here I have
all of my mascaras and brow products not
all my brow products but some of them
and then I have mascaras that either
have not been opened or have been opened
recently since they're in here obviously
they're old I would throw them away it's
just a waste of space all right right
here I have the to base better than
false lashes I love this product it's
awesome
I have smart brow in the back and then I
have in a Nastasia Anasazi a Beverly
Hills brow genius kit right there those
are just stuff on the side
this drawer is nothing but I shadows I
have all my eyeshadows over here most of
them are not just normal I shadow as
most of them are Pro Longwear eyeshadows
or mineralized eyeshadows or something
along that line limited-edition
eyeshadows so I have those all over here
I'm gonna have a few Sigma ones in here
that I really enjoyed and then right
here I have all of my Mac quads so you
can see I've got two in here that are
totally old-school before they came out
their new packaging the ones that say
not for sale in the front if you can see
that that means that it's Mak gratis so
as an employee that's what that means so
a lot of times if I started like back to
Mac something this is not for sale on a
tour like you another matte palette and
then in the very back when you just have
three Urban Decay primer potion as
primers and then over on the side we
have Sigma's awesome eyeliners I haven't
shown these before but they're really
great these are all the eyeliners over
here and I have a little Sigma shadow
sitting right there just hanging out oh
I don't even mention that I have my
drugstore shadows and here as well I
have lost a cup in a Bellini shadows
this drawer is a little bit random I
have my mineralized skinfinish --is and
here all different colors just for
contouring bronzing highlighting or
whatever I need and then back here I
have my Ben Nye cameo luxury powder just
like the banana powder but it's just a
pink undertone then over here I have
cream color bases and then over here I
have more I have bronzers in the front
and they stop right here and then I have
any powders from Mac back here so like
this one right here this is a beauty
powder I don't remember what collection
this is from but it did have special
packaging but when you get the gratis of
free products as an employee at Mac you
don't get the packaging you only get the
product so it's kind of strange how that
works
Londyn collection I don't remember what
it was called something London but that
was four years ago so you can see how
old some of the stuff is and then this
right here this is billionaire bronze
this is a cream stick bronzer by Mac and
then this is the Tarte bronzer in Hotel
Harris and I am NOT a fan of that bronze
myself at all so that's just needs to be
put in my freelance kit and then back
here I have my pallet so I have my naked
my naked - I have the Too Faced neutral
I smoked pallet the lorac palette the
balm new tude balm um Matt tude Urban
Decay emergency Urban Decay everywhere
that's called an N Sigma resort
I love Sigma resort this drawer main
attraction are all of the blushes every
single one of these are Mac blushes so
you can see that I definitely I have an
obsession with blush and with Mac blush
over to the left here we have all
eyebrow products we have Sigma brow
products and Anastasia brow products all
hanging out over here a couple of these
things our backups that I use all the
time and once I run out I will have them
right here which is amazing and I have
an anastacio brow kit here I have a
highlighting powder from Mac here this
is the honey rose it's the one that's
like the high percentage of water so it
feels wet on your skin I have balm
blushes and then I have Mack luster
drops and benefits high-beam back here
and the we back this is a little intense
this right here is I call it my glare
drawer even though it's not all glitter
to me it's the glitter drawer so right
here are all my glitters
these are glitter pigments glitter glue
by Too Faced make it forever make it
forever and then these are pressed
pavements by Mac glitter I love glitter
so that's my glitter right there
these right here my pigments this one is
newer so all of these right here are
matte pigments I also have some map pans
back here but these are reflex from
holiday so they do have glitter in them
over here are my paint pots from Mac all
different colors and I have my shade
sticks over here I have a paint I had
the ball and put a lid on it I shadow
primer and then over here I have more
pigments from makeup geek love these
pigments more primers different colors
these are the crush metal pigments that
you see here and here and also here and
here the very back I have eyeliners
yeah I just don't grab every single day
like silver eyeliners and purple
eyeliners and stuff like that the store
is a little overwhelming but it's
actually my favorite okay boom again
ready so these are my freelance brushes
most of these of what you're looking at
it our Sigma brushes I have a few like
this is crown right here I have like one
set from Sedona lace so yes you can see
this is it's very very deep it goes down
to the very bottom it's all this brushes
they're actually all clean right now
I've just been lazy and prolonging
putting them in the brush kit and making
them look pretty because I don't have a
freelance job for a whole week so that's
right there and then in here this is
just kind of miscellaneous I have a few
other lashes just hanging out right now
just in case I need more my feeling
that's okay I'll grab a few here these
are Sigma bases this is eye shadow base
kit fair dare that kind of thing right
here these are products that I have
tried and I don't like so I will give
them away to people who will like them
that I know and then in the back I have
some more palettes BH Cosmetics palettes
blush palettes I palettes that kind of
thing and then last but not least this
drawer is freelance drawer so this is
the door that I go in if I'm going to a
job that I typically need something else
that's not already in my kit other than
the dial a smile disregard that I have
all my foundations moisturizers primers
anything you can think of in this drawer
so this is just basically stuff that I'm
never going to need for myself because
it's not my color or not my thing like
oil control ocean blotting powders
things like that so I come in here if
I'm ever going on a job and I'm thinking
oh wait I don't have that in my kit I
come dig in this drawer right here so
yeah that is it for my entire makeup
collection I personally use so I really
hope you guys enjoy this video
ooh my back hurts and I will see you
soon bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
