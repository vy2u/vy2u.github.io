today I'm going to be doing a makeup
haul for you I went shopping at Sephora
the day before yesterday and I tweeted
and asked you guys if you would like to
see a haul and funded you said yes so
that's exactly what I am doing now this
is not just one trip to Sephora this is
a trip to Sephora a trip to Nordstrom
and then two orders online as well so
it's been like accumulating over the
past couple of weeks so it's kind of
like a collective haul if you will
basically I got a lot of stuff um I
haven't gone shopping though for makeup
and quite a while like maybe a couple
things here and there but no like big
shopping sprees so I made up for lost
time I do also want to quickly remind
you guys I am Mego out of town to
Chicago I leave this upcoming Tuesday
and I'm going to be gone for almost a
full two weeks and while I'm there I'm
going to be doing a meet and greet at
the lush store at Old Orchard mall I'm
going to be there from 6 to 8 p.m. next
Thursday night on the 25th again it's
the necklace scandal premieres oh and if
you guys are total gladiators like me
and obsessed with Olivia Pope then
you're probably going to be like
scrutiny and great I'm gonna be over the
TV but thank you God for DVR um okay now
I'm ranting about scandal rant over um I
was gonna say why am there I'm not going
to be bringing like my whole setup I'm
not going to be bringing my tripod by
lighting my nice camera and all that
jazz so I'm not going to be able to film
any makeup tutorial on out of town
sadly um I am going to have like my more
basic camera so I'm hoping to get up one
or two videos while I'm gone so if you
guys have any suggestions for me of what
you would like to see let me know in the
comments down below I could do something
like a question and answer video or I
can maybe log or I could do like what's
in my bag tag just something simple like
that it doesn't require the whole
shebang setup jazz so let me know if you
guys would like to see anything I'm
honestly not gonna go probably get up
many videos just because
me with my friends and my family that I
only get to see once or twice a year so
my main focus is going to be on them
because if you know me I'm all about
family time but uh other than that I'm
going to try to film as much as I can so
yeah just let me know your suggestions
and when I get back I'll be back I'm
going to go through the Sephora bag
first and then I'll hop over to
Nordstrom so the first thing I got was
the misty or blooming bouquet perfume
this is my absolute favorite perfume
ever and I'm almost out of my first
bottle so I've had my backup I wear this
all the time
it's so amazing if you guys haven't
smelt it yet just go smell it I'm not
gonna stay here and try to describe a
perfume to you because it's not gonna
work and then I just got a new Beauty
Blender cleaner I honestly got like a
lot of like things I already owned by
need more of so the first several
products but I dated a Beauty Blender
cleaner and I also use this to clean my
brushes like when I go to Chicago I'll
take this with me just to kind of spot
treat brushes as I go I do clean my
brushes and what I'm doing that I use
olive oil and dish soap I've done that
for years so I found on Pinterest and
it's honestly the best way to do it and
sometimes we'll use coconut oil instead
and then I use an antibacterial dish
soap and I'll really take all my brushes
to the sink but when I'm not doing that
and I just I mean clean something quick
I do use the Beauty Blender solid to do
that the unique blender solid cleaner to
do that and it works great on brushes I
got a little mini model of purity
because again I'm traveling and so I
just needed a baby bottle to go with me
the only one I have literally like QVC
status like 65 ounces so I didn't needed
a baby bottle okay let's get to some of
the fun stuff
these aren't working here I got another
oh my god everything to be getting this
hauler literally things I already own
but I did get another laura mercier
moisture supreme foundation because mine
was getting so old and just like EEE
and wasn't the correct color so this is
sunny beige by Laura Mercier this is a
really really
hydrating foundation it's very hydrating
though so you're only going to want to
use it if you are really dry but it's a
medium to full coverage and it's really
beautiful I got the living proof flesh
shaping hairspray I'm interested in this
it says it it's for damp or dry hair
brushable styling shape setting
multitasking so I'm always trying to
find something that's going to give my
hair more texture more body more volume
because my hair is just like flat as can
be it's kind of a mission shaped head I
got a Burberry Brit sheer Burberry Brit
sheer it's just like complicated and
it's a Burberry Bret sheer perfume
rollerball I just love this smell it
smells like just so clean and so fresh
and those are the kind of smells I
always gravitate towards if you guys
ever have emendations for just clean
fresh line perfumes I'm all about that
life like Flowerbomb is literally my
nightmare
it makes me smell like I just went
rolling in a dumpster and have it
showered in like four or five days and
just have like the worst video you can
think of it's just any warm perfume just
does not go good on my body so I'm sorry
I have a hair my mouth okay so finally
your day in the fun part I lost some
more stuff from bite UV because this
would not be a Sephora haul if I didn't
go to bite it's like my favorite lip
products ever okay this is too much to
limit over them up really quick to matte
lip crayons in the shade Lecce and
aubergine aubergine I don't know I'll
link it down below for you guys to make
it easier on me late Shae I'm assuming
it's late J that's what I'm calling it
could be lychee it could be leaked it
could be leash I don't know I'm calling
it late J for now though even though
it's probably not big oh so pretty I'm
telling you I can never have enough news
like ever in my life so right there this
is a Lecce and that's a matte lip crayon
by bite beauty oh my gosh it's so pretty
I just love pinky nudes it's just my
thing and
this one right here this is aubergine
aubergine not really sure I pronounce
this and this is kind of similar to like
a Mac rebel if you guys are familiar
with that it's just like a darker purple
Lee color matte lip crayon I love it I
love that dark purple II kind of vampy
look and you can really switch that up
if you apply it really sheer it'll look
complete different if you apply it like
a really really dark lip liner and go
over top of it I just I love these
colors for fall I think they're
absolutely beautiful
and something like this is so easy
because you can look so fall appropriate
if you just do mascara comb through your
brows with some clear brow gel and apply
a dark lip color like this it's just so
like runway in high-fashion and it's
such an easy way to look like fall ready
I love it I got to contour lip liners
because I really really love their lip
liners I have the one lip liner that I
use often in the shade nutmeg so I
figured it's time to get a couple more
and what I like about them is the way
they're angled I'll show you don't
talking about one side like this I'm a
hot mess today hot mess
okay so I got two lip liners in the
shade cashew and Barbarossa okay let's
show you cashew first cow she reminded
me of nutmeg but it's even more nude
because finding like the perfect nude
lip liner is so difficult this one right
here is called cashew and it looks like
that it looks very nude and has a little
bit of brown in it I definitely would
not consider this a pinky nude
whatsoever but I figured I would give it
a shot cuz a little bit lighter than
nutmeg and nutmeg had a little bit more
pink in it so this is cashew and then
this one is not mess this up barbarossa
Barbaro sodas in this one it really goes
perfectly with that matte lip crayon
that I got and again I just love these
dark purpley colors and I wanted another
dark purple lip liner because the only
ones I have are from Mac and I just love
love this formula and I also love that
that angle it's a slanted angle and when
I first got it I was like
is kind of strange but when you're
applying it and you're just going with
that natural curve of your lip I really
really love it helps sculpt out the lip
and sculpt out the Cupid's bow and it's
just nice and creamy it doesn't bleed I
love love these lip liners I honestly
have never tried a bite beauty product I
have one bad thing to say about I think
I hear ups I'm next specially a package
from ASOS and it shipped seven days ago
and it's still not here and I'm like
where is my kitchen so then right before
I checked out I saw that Smashbox had
come out with these new they're called
be legendary along where lip lacquers
and I was like so I ran over and I got
three different colors I got the shade
keepsake rose water and ultra violet I'm
obviously going to show you so this
right here is keepsake and I'll show you
what it looks like with a swatch pray I
have not tried these all my lips yet
because like I said whenever I get like
all this new stuff and I'm going to do a
haul for you guys I don't open anything
up and try it I try to keep it in their
packaging before I found a video so I'm
really excited to try this because on
the hand is so creamy and pigmented
these are so pigmented like and I didn't
even hear any like promotion for these
either life and I didn't see anywhere
than being advertised they were coming
out so when I saw in the store I was
like what so this keepsake ultra violet
and rosewater oh you see how pigmented
those are I am so so so excited to play
with these I absolutely love this I love
how rosewater is such like a vibrant but
yet pale peachy pink oh these are so
beautiful and they had a lot of them I
mean I don't remember the exact number
but I would say they had around 15
different colors maybe even up to 20
they had a lot but these were my picks
how I'm so excited to talk about this so
this is from Bobbi Brown and this is a
shimmer brick which if you guys watch my
channel you know that I'm in dictate
ditional works I love them all so much
and this is in the shade sandstone and I
found this on Nordstrom calm I have not
seen it in stores and then when I was in
Sephora one of the
ground like reps was there and I asked
her about this and she said it was
limited-edition and it's not technically
out anymore but Nordstrom is still
selling what's left over so if you guys
are interested in this that's the story
behind that and like the front of
packaging is different it has like this
like swirl in it it's not just like that
typical black and it's just so pretty so
this is what it looks like right like
that you can see I already like swatch
it my gosh look how beautiful that is
this is definitely a highlight that I
would recommend for someone who has some
color in their skin whether it's a
sunless tan whether you're just
naturally tan just darker and complexion
because it does have a little bit of
that bronzy warmth in it but it's not
too ronzi where you have to be very dark
to wear it it's just absolutely
beautiful
and if you are more fair you can just
wear this over your blush as opposed to
a highlight on the actual top of the
cheekbone it is gorgeous like I said it
was limited edition so I don't know how
many more they have left but if you guys
are interested in sandstone I will link
the exact place that I found on
Nordstrom down below for you and support
always has those little bins by the
register and so while I was up there I
grabbed the Caudill a great water facial
mist honestly you guys all I saw was
soothing moisturizing and for sensitive
skin and I was like and then along with
that I also got the Caudill a beauty
elixir this is for smoothing glowing
complexion again this is another facial
spray just like a little baby oh so good
it's not like a spa so online because my
store did not have this I saw the cover
of X illuminator in the shade moonlight
so I wanted to try this because I've
never heard of it I've never seen
anybody talk about it and it is so
beautiful again I've not tried this on
my actual face so I can't say like it's
an al but so far on my hand it is
gorgeous it's right here if you can see
that it's a very pale highlight so
someone who is very fair could really
wear this and it would just look
beautiful it's a very vanilla neutral
based highlight so it's not too warm I
just absolutely love it it's very sheer
it's a very finely molded
it's really really pretty right there
that's the cover of X and then that's
the Bobby Brown sandstone so you should
be able to see him a little bit better
there I got the new Bobby Brown along
wear gel Sparkle shadow liner the rep
was there and I was like so what is this
supposed to be exactly she's like um
like shadow and like liner I was like
okay so I got it in the shade smokey
topaz and I got this specifically
because soon as I saw I had like an
immediate look in my mind that I'm like
I hope I can make that happen I want to
do it
smokey black cat eye and I wanted to
like be gradient and like gradually fade
into this right here kind of like smoke
anyways I have it in my mind I'm gonna
make it happen so this is what it looks
like right here let me try to like get
some out great
I hate having a curl like sometimes like
dig out half the product but this is
what that looks like right there again
there's a smokey topaz I think they had
six different shades and this one was my
favorite because it's just so pretty I
got another Kat Von D blush I really
liked her blood but I really liked her
blush formulations and this is in the
shade which I got this one online
because in my store didn't carry it
which i think is weird and it's just a
really really pretty like pale apricot
color it's very like orange a peach but
I love that it's nice and pale so that
you don't have to be really dark to wear
this but yeah if you do have some color
on your skin it'll really just look like
a glow as opposed to an actual like BAM
blush I love this any is hard to find a
nice pale peachy blush a lot of times
peachy apricot blush is are very dark or
just like intense where this one I just
love that it's nice and faded and
understated it just really pretty has a
little bit of shimmer in it which I love
so that is wish by Kat Von D then I
ordered this one online as well because
for some reason my Sephora doesn't have
it and this is the Stila sun bronzing
powder and shade one i've never heard
anybody talk about this before and
whenever i've never heard of somebody
talk about something
we do you hit a boat one out
anyways oh my god oh my god whenever I
hadn't heard someone talk about a
product before I'm always thinking like
okay see they're gonna be total crap or
it's gonna be like this hidden gem that
I'm gonna like discover like when I
bought that the opal online I had never
heard that in my life I I had no idea
and that is like one of my favorite
all-time products to ever happen so you
know I'm saying you know I'm saying I
love the color of it on my hand because
it has a little bit like that terracotta
color but yeah it's not too dark and
it's not too red because I personally
cannot wear a red bronzer because it
just looks super muddy on me so I always
try to go with something that's more
like a terra cotta type undertone and
lights because I don't like using a
bronzer that's really dark that you have
to really work with and blend blend
blend I like one that's just a little
bit I would say three shades darker than
my skin tone is what I go for that way
it doesn't look like too much or
overboard coming from the girl who
always has too much bronzer and always
has too much blush okay we're done with
Sephora hallelujah and then from North
Shaw I ordered the new Mac Studio sculpt
defining powder I got mine in the shade
dark which is right here
okay this is the first time I've shown
something that I got from Mac and so I
just don't shove an app that much
anymore just like maybe one or two
things here there because working there
for four years I have more makeup from
Mac than I will ever need so I just
don't really shop there that often but I
really wanted to try these because I
really like Mac powder and their studio
sculpt line is one of my favorites so
this is a studio sculpt defining powder
in the shade dark and I always use the
shade dark to contour so that's exactly
what I got I love this powder so far on
my hand because it has like a really
beautiful glowy finish to it even though
there's no sparkle or shimmer it's
really really nice so I'm excited to try
it it definitely have I got orange emore
terracotta undertone which I personally
like but it's not for everybody I grab a
new deerskin star foundation this have
an SPF 30 in it and it's supposed to be
an illuminating foundation so when I
heard that I was of you
and I had to try every illuminating
foundation I possibly can and I don't
like it then I will return it but I at
least I can try every single foundation
out there because foundation is one of
those things that it's like I'm never
done looking for the perfect foundation
just like I've never done looking for
the perfect pair of jeans it's just like
even if I love my foundation on my foot
there could be something better so I
always wrote try everything that's going
to be dewy or illuminating whatsoever so
this is the Dior skin star foundation
it's not a nice before I yes that's why
I had to get at Nordstrom I only got two
more things I'm going to save the best
for last
this is from philosophy and this is the
amazing grace satin finished body oil
mist so I already have a love-hate
relationship with this because I
actually love this oil mist it's just so
nice when you spray it on your skin it
just it's so moisturizing and it doesn't
feel sticky and it just it's so
beautiful but the scent
we can't get over Emma's I know Amazing
Grace is a very popular set and a lot of
people love it it's just not for me and
especially since this is something that
I would be using soon as I get out of
the shower or the bath and spray on my
body and it's just very overwhelming and
it doesn't go with my perfumes and other
fragrances that I have so I just I'm
gonna do I'm hoping maybe that if I go
to the mother philosophy I'll be able to
find a set that's better amazing grace
thing they have more than one so last
but most certainly not least because oh
my don't you guys this is the new fresh
cream body lotion by philosophy oh I
wish you guys could be here right now
just to smell this like I want to just
smell this I'm not kidding oh my god
every single time I smell it it's almost
like it's so good that you forget so
amazing that you're like was it really
that good oh my god good it's so amazing
it just it honestly does smell like
fresh cream it is absolutely one of the
best smells I've ever smelled my entire
life it smells so creamy almost like
buttercream cake but then I have like
this freshness to it as well so if
you're someone like me who doesn't like
a really overpowering warm scent this is
just amazing
like that fresh creamy sense okay that's
why it's called fresh cream I got it
absolutely amazing I had not used up my
whole body yet because like I said I
don't like to use things before I talk
about them but I have put some on my
hand like rubbed on my arm with my first
bought it and I was just like oh my god
it just smells so good and of course it
is so moisturizing I love the last few
products they're great so that that I'm
altum of my whole I am so proud I got
thought through all of that and one take
- that's awesome
okay so I really hope that you guys
enjoy this video and I'm sorry if it was
really really long but I definitely
bought a lot of stuff so yeah I hope
that you enjoy it again please leave me

like to see in upcoming upcoming videos
