not like I really wet anywhere but I'm
back
so once do it or something so anyways
today's video is going to be all about
the makeup geek foiled eyeshadow
collection I'm really looking forward to
filming this video because number one
it's been extremely requested and number
two I'm gonna do okay
grow up jacqueline because i realized
recently that i use the shadows on
camera quite often but i've never
actually gone and depth about these
shadows other than just random
favourites videos where i'll just
mentioned like all i love this and then
i'll just move on so i wanted to make an
entire video of how I use these how I
apply them what I like about them what
to look out for and then I will also
give you swatches of every single shade
so it's perfect timing because Marlena
did just come out with 10 new gorgeous
colors for spring which are these bad
boys on this side of the palette you can
see that she came out with some pops of
color and a lot of pastels which are
just beautiful and over here these are
the original 10 which are much more dark
and warmer and deeper very fall kind of
winter s even though I wear these colors
all year round like let's get real fuzzy
I will be giving you swatches of all 20
shadows that way you can see the
pigmentation of them and how they look
when they're on the skin so first thing
I have to say before giving any review
whatsoever this video is not sponsored
Marlene do not ask me to make this video
and I'm not being paid to make this
video I want to get that out of the way
so that everyone knows that I am in no
way talking good about these shadows for
any other reason other than I want to
which has been the way it's been since
day one and will continue to roll that
way on my channel moving on so for those
of you who are maybe wondering what the
difference is between a foil eyeshadow
and a regular shimmery eyeshadow a foil
eyeshadow is going to mimic the look of
tin foil which is where the name foil
comes from it's going to give a very
bright very metallic very beaming look
on the eye it's a very statement i
shadow foiled eyeshadow has more oil in
it than a normal eye shadow so when you
touch it it is extremely creamy
extremely pigmented but what's great
about that oil is it holds all the
pigment together so as opposed to a
normal pigment or normal eyeshadow as
you're applying it it can kind of fall
down and crumble on your cheeks these
don't the oil keeps them nice and
compact together so that those pigment
particles just go straight onto the lid
and they don't move it's like glue it
just gives the eye a very beaming fresh
metallic very youthful look so as far as
the review portion of these shadows go
it's going to be pretty short and sweet
because I'll be honest with you and this
is gonna sound dramatic but it's the
truth these shadows are hands-down my
favorite formulation that I've ever used
in all of the cosmetic industry and I
have tried different brands for the past
ten years of my life and there's nothing
like these like at least not sold in
Sephora or Ulta I cannot think of one
negative about these shadows and I have
been using them for months and months
and months and I'm telling you it's
gotten to the point they're so amazing
now when it comes to putting a color all
over my lid area I never want to use
anything else because these have like
spoiled me and it's kind of funny
because you're used to what you have and
then once something better comes along
you're like oh my gosh
now that seems so bad when before it was
so good you know what I'm saying so it's
like if I go back to like all that
glitters which is just a shimmery
eyeshadow from Mac and I try to put that
on my lid I'm like oh no I can't because
these are so good that they make other
things look bad even though they're not
bad do you want to say does that make
sense like Mac shadows are good but
these are so good that you're like oh we
don't need that we don't need that we
have this when I am applying these
foiled eyeshadows I always use a
synthetic brush I would recommend either
a synthetic brush or your fingertips
your fingertips will work just as fine
if you don't want to use a brush I
personally usually use a brush just
because that is how I roll and the mac
242 one is just my ride-or-die I have
used this in so many tutorials it's
ridiculous at this point but it's just
one of those brushes that in my
collection it's like irreplaceable this
is going to just make a very big
difference when applying these foiled
eyeshadows as opposed to using a natural
hairbrush a natural hair brush is
usually going to be white you'll see
just like this one right here this will
apply the foil eyeshadow but the
difference is this is not going to make
it as pigmented and you will have a
little bit more fallout as opposed to
this synthetic brush it'll be highly
pigmented highly
talak and you won't have any fallout so
depending what you're looking for you
could do natural or synthetic but I
prefer synthetic because it gives more
bang for your buck the only thing about
these shadows that could possibly end up
being a negative is if you have
extremely oily eyelids because of the
oil in the shadow that makes them foiled
eyeshadows that could possibly be an
issue for those of you who have
extremely oily lids now my friends who
use these they are very oily and they
have not had an issue with these
creasing or fading or anything like that
but Marlena did mention that could be a
possibility so that's honestly the only
thing I would have my reservations about
but again my friends who are oily they
have not had an issue but if you have
very oily lids and you really want to
try these maybe just order one and see
how it goes for you and then go from
there but for me personally and for my
friends we have not seen that happen
they are extremely pigmented and they
keep their pigmentation pigmentation and
they're metallic all day long like they
don't fade on me whatsoever so now that
you guys know that I actually love these
eyeshadows I swear like I think I could
stand on a rooftop I'm just like scream
about these foiled eyeshadows let's get
into this watching part of it so that
you can see all the shades and how they
look on the skin so the first shade that
we have here is one of my personal
favorites and this is called in the
spotlight this is a beautiful light
peachy kind of pale champagne shade I
love this because you can wear it all
over your lid and blend it out with
whatever color you want in the crease
and I'm telling you it'll always look
beautiful it is the perfect everyday
shimmery lid shade next we have
grandstand I have mentioned this one
quite a few times it is a beautiful warm
kind of topi sandy shade it's very
bronze II it'll give you a nice glow and
I love wearing this with a super dark
smoky eye next we have magic acts and
this is a very pale muted champagne gold
this will be great for those of you who
have very fair skin and are maybe more
cool and tone and you're not comfortable
doing a really warm bronze this would
still give you a very beautiful summer
glow but not be too over-the-top now we
have mesmerize this is a very cool tone
kind of slate purple this is a great
color if you're used to wearing really
warm shades but you want to jump into
that cool zone this is beautiful all
over the lid and just smoke it out with
a warm brown this is the shade
flamethrower and the name of this
represents the color perfectly as you
can see this is a very intense very warm
copper
now we have jester this is a beautiful
olive green with metallic gold running
through it so you really get that
three-dimensional effect this is center
stage this is a very cool tone very deep
Navy and as you move you will see a
little bit of a cool tone purple in
there as well now we have the shade
Houdini I personally think that this is
the most unique color out of all this
collection it's a mixture between
emerald green and a turquoise and it
comes together to make this beautiful
warm vibrant blue now we have Caitlyn
rose this is a true vibrant cool tone
purple and the cool thing about this
shade is every dollar goes to an amazing
organization and you can look up all
that information on makeup geek calm now
we have fortune teller and the best way
for me to describe this color is a
bright yellow sunshine gold fantasy is a
true pale mint green I never knew that I
wanted a mint green shadow in my life
but now that I have one I'm glad that I
do this is high wire and this is such an
intense platinum silver with a touch of
blue in it so it's like a gray blueish
silver it's so unique that it's
difficult to describe but it is so cool
this is charmed and this is a very
difficult color to label but it is a mix
between a silver and a green and the
color that whatever you want to call it
is just so cool and so unique this is
masquerade and this is a mixture of both
hot pink and purple it makes the most
bright beautiful fuchsia color this is
Pegasus and this is my personal favorite
out of all the bright colors that she
created this to me is just a pool party
and an eye shadow it is perfect for
summer this is the shade untamed this is
a mix between a bronze and a yellow gold
so it kind of turns out to like a
mustardy bronze I know that doesn't
sound beautiful but it is whimsical is
another great everyday shade especially
for those of you who are more on the
fair side this is a very cool tone I see
pink daydreamer is a very true lavender
but of course since its foiled it gives
that intense metallic which makes it so
different from any other lavender shadow
I've seen last but not least we have the
shade starry-eyed this is one of my
personal favorite shades for everyday
use it is just so beautiful with
whatever color you choose to put in your
crease
it is a great neutral as you can see
it's a very pale vanilla champagne color
this is pretty accurate of what it looks
like when I walked out of Sephora all
