to be doing a makeup tutorial on this
look right here using the am an emu a
and make it beep palette thank you so
much for joining us like obsessed I love
you haha
alright anyway so for today's video I'm
going to be doing a makeup tutorial on
this look right here I kind of drew some
inspiration on this look from my last
video because there was such a high
request for a makeup tutorial on that
look um but I didn't want to do that
exact look for you so instead what I did
is I recreated that look with the mani
mua palettes that he created with makeup
geek and I am so excited to finally be
holding this and I'm so happy for mani
I'm so excited for mani I'm so proud of
Manny I'm just it's awesome to see this
come together my first time I ever
watched mani the first video I ever saw
of his he said in that video like oh my
god could you imagine if I collaborated
makeup geek one day like I would just
die and it's so funny cuz one year later
he's collaborating makeup geek and it's
like it's so cool it's just it's so cool
so I'm really happy for him hair it's
just so cool I'm gonna stop talking
following mani if you want to get
updates on the palettes it sold out
currently but it will be restocked I
believe next week he said but follow his
social media if you get people keep you
guys updated all socials I'm sure so
yeah nice not badly and jump into the
video thanks for watching I love you and
I'll see you soon bye oh in a true mani
fashion if you don't like it please
don't watch it I mean it's not exactly
how he says it but you know I'm trying
to be a lady here on my channel mhm
you know I'm saying a quick disclaimer
my spray tan is bad this is not cute on
my wrist so throughout the video orange
hands orange everything ah it's not good
so I sort of throw that out there yes
I'm aware the spray tan is bad it's not
a good situation all right let's do this
thingy first things first I'm going to
prime at my eyes and I'm going to be
using the Too Faced shadow insurance I
typically use a concealer and then set
it with a powder for my eye primer which
I actually do prefer but for some reason
I was just I don't know I was in a mood
and I was like you know what we're going
to do this today so that's what I did
now I'm going to be going in with the
man EMU a and makeup geek eyeshadow
palette and I'm going to be grabbing
beaches and cream right here top center
to heat any fluffy brush that you love
and you trust and you have a long-term
committed relationship with you're going
to go in and just blend that out all the
way from the outer corner to the inner
corner as you can see beaches and cream
pretty much doesn't show up on me
especially when I have a spray tan like
I do right now but I'm still going to
throw it in there just for good faith
and it will help blend out the next
colors I'm going to be mixing Sora and
frappe and I'm going to do the exact
same thing as I did with beaches and
cream I'm going to take these two colors
and I'm going to go from inner corner to
outer corner all the way back and forth
and windshield wiper motions I'm putting
the heaviest of the pigment right there
in the crease of my eye if you do not
have a crease in your eye you can just
create one just pick a place and go back
and forth and windshield wiper motions
and then whatever is left over on my
brush I will just lightly kind of blend
upward as you see me doing right now but
I don't have barely any pigment on my
brush at that point now I'm going to mix
Mars and Aphrodite Mars is like a really
intense kind of reddish raspberry and
then Aphrodite is a really kind of
beautiful true deep dark brown I'm going
to mix those two together to get almost
like the color of like chocolate
cherries I want to say and I'm going to
take again any fluffy brush that you
love this is the morphe m43 3 and I'm
going to keep this a little bit lower
than I did with the first shade since it
is so dark and I'm really going to go
heavy in the crease itself as you can
see I'm being very sloppy on the lid
because I don't care how that looks I'm
not going to worry about blending that
out because I'm going to cover that up
with another shade in just a few moments
I'm only going to worry about blending
out the top area in the crease so I will
go back with another fluffy brush which
is a little bit more of either frappe or
Sora just any light brown you could grab
peaches and cream and we're just going
to go over that area nice and slow and
very soft just to slightly blend out
those edges without making them come too
high or look too jagged now I'm going to
pick up cosmopolitan which is a really
beautiful kind of rosy golden shade and
grabbing a mac 242 brush I did wet my
brush a little bit with fix+ I'm going
to begin just to put this all over the
entire lid and at first I was like do I
only want this in the inner corner kind
of fade out I wasn't quite sure but then
I ended up doing like a really intense
it almost creates like a
an illusion of a cut crease because I
wet my brush and I made it so metallic
I'm going to really use this brush to
make it really intense so my lid color
is just strictly cosmopolitan and then
that darker chocolate cherry shade is
just strictly in the crease so that's
why I decided to do with that and then
when I packed on glitter later I just
love the way it all came together I'm
going and just making it a little bit
darker in the crease area because I just
thought that it needed a little bit more
extra once I had on cosmopolitan now for
a liner I am using the Maybelline gel
liner I swear to God you guys like this
is still my favorite gel liner it's my
favorite gel liner forever like nothing
compares to it
everything smudges nothing lasts nothing
is as black as I want it to be like this
is the most balm liner ever and it's
from the drugstore you can get it at
Walgreens CVS Ulta it's my favorite gel
liner of all time so I am doing a wing
but I'm gonna keep it a little on the
thin side this is at least thin for me
because I love a big huge intense whoa I
like a big intense thick wing but I'm
gonna keep this one small so I'm gonna
go in with a little bit of the Too Faced
glitter glue this is my absolute
favorite way to apply glitter it's the
best glitter glue out there it doesn't
separate it does like it really is super
glue for glitter it keeps it on your
eyes it's not going to fall off
throughout the night it really does stay
in place it's like gorilla glue for your
eyeshadow it's amazing so I will pack it
on with a brush and then I'll grab
glitter and obviously immediately pack
the glitter on right over top of it you
want to make sure you do it fairly
quickly because once the glue dries it
doesn't serve the same purpose you want
that glue to still be tacky on the lid
when you're packing on the glitter and
since I am packing on so much glitter by
the way I'm using eye candy glitter in
the shade taffy such a gorgeous color
it's like a rose gold kind of coppery
pink it went perfect with this eye look
this is the same glitter I was also
wearing in my last video because a lot
of you guys were asking so I will find
it link it down below for you I'm just
covering up my eyeliner again so I don't
have glitter all over my liner because
that is definitely a pet peeve of mine
is when you have glitter all over the
liner so I always make sure to cover
that up on myself and then I'm going to
pop on some lashes and I'm using flutter
lashes in the style Ashlee these are
such a cool lash they're like very wispy
very long but yet they're not SuperDuper
thick so you can still see through them
and see the eyeshadow look if you know
what I'm saying
now I'm going to prime my skin and I'm
using this ridiculously bougie YSL
primer I don't know the exact name of it
but again I'll find it below I'll find
it in all the stuff you guys down below
but it's a blurring primer it's my
second time using it and I really like
it we're gonna kick it old-school with
the giorgio armani a luminous silk
foundation i am using the morphe m4 3:9
foundation brush to apply this I swear
this foundation is just so good like if
you've been around my channel for a
while you know this was pretty much all
my foundation I use for like a solid
eight months and I haven't used it in a
long time cuz I've been trying new
foundations I went back to this one and
I'm just like Oh missed you so much it's
just such a good foundation I forgot how
much I loved it so then for concealer
I'm gonna you know just pack the entire
bottle on my face no big deal I'm going
to be using the urban decay a weightless
Naked concealer this like I said before
was my favorite concealer of all time I
have gotten everyone addicted to it I've
got my mom addicted I've got my sister
I've got my friends I've gotten my
cousins I've got everybody to do this
concealer I swear works for everyone I
know it's so beautiful it is so
weightless it doesn't get a Creasy mess
it's not too oily it's not too creamy
it's it's it's the most beautiful
concealer ever I swear like urban decay
has like some Voodoo going on in their
lives because they created the most
incredible concealer of all time so I am
putting that under my eyes forehead nose
and a little on the chin and then I'm
going to grab the Anastasia banana
powder and I'm going to pack that
wherever I put the concealer so I use a
pretty light amount and I am blending
out with a really really fluffy brush
this is the ìiî it's part of the
morphe elite collection and as you can
see it is really yellow and the reason I
like that is because it's going to help
to really bright in my face and
especially once I put on bronzer it'll
just kind of pull the whole look
together everything will look nice and
light and fresh now we're going to go in
and contour using my favorite contour
powder and my favorite contour brush
this is my favorite way of contouring as
far as the brush goes this is the m-52 3
brush by morphe I am obsessed I think
it's the most amazing contour brush I
used to love the NARS Itoh one and now
this has taken over my Holy Grail
because it just makes it softer and more
blendable and easy to apply it's just
it's beautiful and then for the actual
powder I'm using Mac shade stir you can
find on mac cosmetics calm and then I
realized the center of my
forehead was looking dingy and dirty so
I grabbed a little bit of that Anastacio
banana powder and I lightened it up my
face looks really light because I was so
darks like darkly spray tan
but once everything oxidizes in like 30
minutes I will get a little bit darker
my face will match my body a little bit
more I'm going to grab the RCM a no
color powder and I'm going to just put
this right there going it from the
corner of my lip to the corner of the
top of my ear not corner I'm sorry
corner of my lip to the top of my ear
I'm going to make a line I'm going to
let that sit while I finish my makeup
and then it will just sharpen up my
contour gotta trim the brows so what you
got to do when you just see that extra
brow hair grow and just get rid of it I
do not suggest just going in with
scissors to your brows by the way if you
haven't done it before like first go to
a professional don't chop off your brows
ladies my best friend literally took
scissors to her eyebrows when she was 12
years old it was the saddest thing ever
oh my god
girl I still feel for you I'm filling in
my brows using the Anastasia brow
definer I feel this is the only brow
pencil I'm ever gonna use for the rest
of my life I'm so obsessed it makes it
so quick and easy and then I'm going to
go in and grab the highlighting shade
from the mani MUA palette and this is
the color Artemis um it kind of its kind
reminds me of Mac nylon in a sense it's
a really beautiful highlight and it's
got a little bit of like a yellow sheen
in it it's gorgeous so it's going to
pack a little bit of that only the high
point of the brow and then a teensy tiny
bit on the very inner corner of the eye
just to keep things kind of nice and
bright and I'm going to grab frappe and
then just any pencil brush and I'm going
to just run this over the lower lash
line I want this to be darkest and most
intense on the very outer corner that's
just a personal preference for me though
that has nothing to do with the look
that's just the way I like it on my eye
shape is I like it to be the darkest and
I like it to come down the lowest on the
outer corner of the eye then I'm
grabbing a little bit of Aphrodite I
didn't show a shot of it but that's what
I'm doing right now is that super dark
brown I'm going to pack that on super
super tight to my lash line like
literally in my lashes on my lash line
as close as possible and then I will
blend it back out with more frappe you
can grab some Mars and go in and blend
that out if you want to make it a little
bit more raspberry under there that's
totally up to you and then I'm going to
grab mac cosmetics fascinating eye Kohl
this is like stark white like as white
as paper it's not creamy it's not a nude
it is white but I wanted to use it to
I to really make the colors pop and also
make my eyes stand out as well
then I'm going to go in with blush and
I'm using the Sephora brand blush in the
shade tangerine tease I was online
shopping a couple weeks ago on Sephora
calm and I just tried a couple of these
I bought some of them because I've never
tried Sephora brand blush and some of
them I don't really love but this one I
think is really really beautiful it's
got some nice shimmer and it's a
beautiful coral so I'm going to go ahead
and just erase that bacod if you will to
reveal a nice shop contour if this is
too sharp for you totally understandable
go back with your contour brush ever so
lightly and just lightly go over it and
it will make it a little bit more buffed
out but I'm going to keep it nice and
sharp girl I'm going to go in with this
Mally face and cheek palette I
discovered this because of
kathleenlights and I'm not gonna lie I
ordered on Amazon for like two times the
price because I'm just that kind of girl
when someone's raving about something
I'm like oh I have to have it I'll do
what I need to do to get my hands on
this bad boy but can we talk about this
highlight no let's just take a moment of
silence for the highlight oh my god I
can't breathe okay I'm going to take
that same highlight I'm going to put on
the Cupid's bow this is just a little
trick to make the mouth look a little
bit powder and then I'm going to take
Lotte and I'm going I'm sorry frappe and
I'm going to just coat that all over the
bottom lip again you will see it's going
to give it more of a shadow to make it
look like it is fuller now I'm going to
go in with mac cosmetics subculture lip
pencil I just purchased this last week
because this used to be my favorite lip
pencil ever when I worked at Mac I wore
every day with every shade of nude that
you can think of it was my go-to color
and I just remembered like why don't I
use that color anymore so I jumped
online and I bought it and I'm in love
with it all over again
it's such a good everyday lip liner like
it's just the perfect color for
day-to-day lips at least for me it's
just a great neutral then I'm gonna go
in with the ariana grande and MAC
Cosmetics Viva Glam gloss if you guys
don't know about the Mac Viva Glam
program it's amazing 100% of the
proceeds go to men women and children
living with and affected by HIV and AIDS
so it's always nice to know that your
money is going to a great organization
whenever you buy a Viva Glam
gloss or lipsticks so last but not least
I'm going to just coat my lower lashes
with some mascara because I forgot to do
this and then I looked at myself and I
was like wait something's missing so I'm
using the Mac extended play mascara
which is my favorite
lower lash and then this look is
complete I hope you guys enjoy the video
thanks so much for watching I love you
and I'll see you in my next video bye
guys
