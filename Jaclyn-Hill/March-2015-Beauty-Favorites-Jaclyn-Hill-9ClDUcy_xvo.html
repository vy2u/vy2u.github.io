again well actually no it's not that
time of the month again but it's it's
that time of the month again it's time
you're in my favorites video today is
going to be my March favorites and I am
super excited about this favorites video
because I have so many like substantial
products I feel like I'm just excited
about the products I'm gonna be talking
about today so yeah did anybody watch
the Justin Bieber roast on Comedy
Central last night because I did and
honestly I'm like I don't have a big
opinion oh hang on I don't have a big
opinion on Justin Bieber like I don't
love him or hate him it's just like
whatever but last night I was like mmm
with his little closing speech I was
like I believe in second chances I
believe in you babe so yeah I was pretty
entertained last night for like a good
two hours straight I was glued to the TV
anyways so let's get into my monthly
favorites I have to say I know you guys
have probably never seen you as my hair
pulled back so tightly before but as I
mentioned my previous video I sliced my
thumb open with a knife and I'm trying
not to use it and so this is what my
hair is doing and it looks like it's
like greasy on top because of the
lighting but it's really not for the
first time ever
so I'm sorry excuse the hair but I've
come to accept that it's gonna be up for
the next week while my finger heals so
you should probably come to accept that
as well so the first part I want to talk
about honestly you guys I did not think
that I was gonna love this as much as I
do I especially think this was going to
become like my everyday go-to foundation
and this is the new Dior nude air serum
foundation this just came out maybe like
four five weeks ago or so as soon as I
saw online I ordered it and ever since I
have received it in the mail it has been
my non-stop foundation it is a serum
foundation so because of that it is more
on the sheer side I would say it's a
sheer to medium it's not extremely sheer
to the point that you put it on it's
like a tinted moisturizer it has some
coverage but what I love about it is it
will even out your skin tone it'll
smooth everything over it'll cover up
imperfections be it it still looks like
your skin every single time I wear this
out of the house without doubt someone
complements my skin and I love that
because no one's complimenting my makeup
they're not like oh what foundation are
you wearing that lays well no people are
complimenting my skin because this
foundation looks
like skin you know I'm saying so it's
absolutely gorgeous it doesn't settle in
any little lines that I have it just
lays so beautifully I will say though
that if you don't sit with a powder and
you like rub your face roughly it is
gonna come off because I can tend to
rest on my hand like this and pout and
at the end of the day I will notice that
I'll have like some of this foundation
missing so it's because I'm resting my
hand like this all the time so if you
rub your face this will come off if you
don't set it with the powder but if I
set that area with powder I'm good to go
so that's just a little tip this next
product is honestly so incredible I
don't even know to say about it because
no matter what I say it's not going to
do it justice because it's so amazing it
is by Kevin O Kwan and it is the
celestial skin liquid lighting so
basically it's just a liquid highlighter
it is so different from any other liquid
highlighter I've ever used the color
itself is absolutely gorgeous it's like
a champagne vanilla shade it's gonna
work on so many different skin tones but
the way it blends out you guys oh my
gosh it does not look like shimmer it
doesn't look frosty it doesn't even
really look like glitter your like a
highlight in general it just looks like
you're beaming like I swear to god this
is like Victoria Secret model in a tube
like it is just so beautiful I have not
used it on top of my foundation but the
way that I had used it so far I'll put
it in my fingertips and I will just rub
it all over my face and then apply my
foundation over top or I will mix it
with my foundation and go in that way I
have not used it on top of my foundation
yet so I don't know how that would work
I'm sure it would work beautifully
though because so far it's been
absolutely amazing but I would recommend
this to absolutely everybody of all ages
because of the fact that it's
moisturizing because of the fact that
it's not over-the-top glittery or
shimmery and it just looks so amazing
any age could get away with this and
it's not going to settle and fine lines
it's not gonna make you age and look any
older than you are it's just gorgeous
this is the Becca shimmering skin
Perfector in the shade opal and I have
fallen in love with this because I found
this bad boy in my drawer and this is
the exact same thing as this but it came
out for Christmas and because it was in
such a cute little packaging I was like
look like this and I tried it and I fell
in love with it and then I realized that
it's the exact same thing as this
just any smaller cuter packaging so the
way I have been using this recently is I
will just pump it
put a couple dots on top of my
foundation and then with my damp Beauty
Blender I will blend it out so I'll do
my foundation my concealer and then
before I go with any powders I will use
this dab it all over my cheek bones
blend it out and I'm you guys it is so
gorgeous and the reason I love this so
much is because it is a highlight like
this is not just like let me know it is
beautiful it is such a gorgeous beaming
highlight and what I love is it doesn't
break up your foundation there are so
many liquid highlighters that I love so
much but you put on your foundation and
it breaks it up it separates it it takes
away your foundation and it drives me
crazy this doesn't do that this is like
glue on my skin like when I put it on it
just goes on top of my foundation and it
sits there and it is just absolutely
beautiful so this isn't a shape opal
they do come in a few different colors
they come in moonstone they also come in
topaz so whatever your skin tone is they
will have one of these to match your
specific needs
I never ever thought I would see the day
where I put a side Mac pull on wear
concealer turn my back and take on
another lover oh the day has come this
is the Urban Decay Naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer
say no more
this concealer is everything and the
craziest thing is I was describing this
to my friend and I was like it's just so
weightless but yet still full coverage
and she was like you know that's what
it's called right and I was like the
person who name is concealer was on
point that day because it is seriously
so weightless but yet so full coverage
it is amazing you just need a tiny bit
and it goes such a long way I love the
packaging I love this lengthy tube and I
love this wand that kind of goes back
and forth and Wiggles it's the little
things in life right like this makes me
very happy and honestly I can't believe
that I have been using this all month
and not using my mac prolongwear
concealer what I haven't touched my pro
longwear concealer since I started using
this but it's so much easier to apply
the Mac Pro Longwear and it's got the
same amount of coverage but yet it's
moisturizing I swear I'm talking about
like all the basics today it was like
foundations highlight
there's concealers and now I'm gonna
talk about a primer like what is going
on Who am I this month but this primer
is amazing so this is the makeup forever
primer they came out with tons of them
like I feel like they came out like 10
of them and they sent them to like
everyone they sent them to youtubers
makeup artists Beauty vloggers
instagramers they sent out a press
package to pretty much everybody with
all these primers and I actually bought
three of them before they sent it to me
so I was like but that's okay because I
have friends and family who are very
happy to take them off my hands I want
to talk about one of them for you guys
because I use this in my last video and
this is the smoothing primer and I
honestly don't care for this for me
because I like to be dewy I like to look
a little bit oily because I am dry /
normal skin so I like to have that glow
going on but for those of you who are
oily I would very much recommend the
smoothing primer for makeup forever
because it is so similar to the benefit
Porefessional but better I use this in
my last video and oh my gosh it smooths
out my skin like when I put it on I was
like holy cow like no pores no texture
like babies but all over my face that's
disgusting
but for those of you who are oily and
you need to control oil I would very
highly recommend this to you guys
because it was awesome this is the
radiant primer they came out with a noir
nourishing one hydrating one they came
out with a few radiant ones and then
they come out smoothing ones I believe
that's it I've been loving this radiant
primer it does come out yellow because
yellow will help make your skin radiant
when you blend into the skin it is not
going to look yellow at all I know
people will ask that when they see
yellow or orange primers it's not going
to make your skin that color it's just
going to help radiate the skin and make
it look beautiful in this past month
clearly I have been into luminous
healthy-looking dewy radiant skin so
I've really been liking this I honestly
can't say that it's done anything as far
as making my foundation last longer I
just know that after I use this as a
primer my foundation goes on so nicely
so that's what I love about it so the
Anastasia Beverly Hills lip glosses came
out this month which was super exciting
I was planning on doing a lip swatch
video of the lip glosses when I got them
but when I received them in the mail I
was
about how many they came out with like
they probably came out with 30 at least
maybe 40 there was a lot and I was like
but if you guys want to see like a top
10 of my favorite glosses by Anastacio
like my favorite shades just let me know
request it down in the comments I'll be
happy to do that for you guys I am
wearing one right now I am wearing the
shade dollhouse which is this shade
right here I asked my favorites laying
here in front of me this is the shade
orchid which is this beautiful purple
color and you can see how pigmented they
are they are intensely highly pigmented
they're thick they stay on the lips a
long time they feel moisturizing but yet
they have like a sustainability on your
lips where they feel almost like you
know talking about like their they're
tacky but they're not sticky at all this
is a shade peony and this is beautiful
it's such a light baby pink I mix that a
lot with the shade dainty I believe yes
I'm getting it this is nude pink as can
be it doesn't look as new pink here as
it actually is like if I put this on my
lips it's a very light nude pink
so that's dainty and it's gorgeous and
then this is Maui which is such a fun
peachy bright coral so awesome they came
out with so many corals which I love
because I love corals in the spring and
summer I think the tan skin with coral
lip gloss is just like it is everything
to me it is like my obsession next I had
the products which I am most excited to
talk about in this entire video because
I have been waiting for this for months
that's traumatic but it's the truth if
you guys have been around on my channel
for a while and you may or may not have
seen me talk about this brand about six
months ago and one of my favorites
videos and this is a sunless tanning
product by the brand loving tan let me
just say right now ever since I
discovered this it is the only sunless
tanning product I have used everything
else I've gotten rid of I've given away
this is a brand from Australia and when
I purchased it they only shipped from
Australia so the shipping cost was like
25 or 30 dollars it was intense and I
talked all about that in my favourites
video when I first mentioned these but
it was so worth it to me because this
product is so incredible the tan is so
beautiful and natural looking and just
bronzy and it's not too green it's not
too or
not to brown like I don't want to look
brown I don't want to look orange your
green your I'm saying like it's just
beautiful I'm a bad example of it right
now because I haven't used it in like
five days but in my question and answer
video I had just used it two days before
that so that's a better example of how
this works on the skin my favorite is
the two hour Express this is in the
shade dark you literally just wipe it on
your body two hours later you shower and
you're done it's so simple it's not
sticky I can't stand sticky products it
drives me crazy and these the smell is
so subtle which is what sold me because
I cannot deal with that over intense
like Mystic Tan tanner smell Oh drives
me crazy this is the most subtle subtle
I can't say where this is the most
subtle scent that I've ever smelled any
sillas tanning product well that was
difficult for me to get out if you want
to be dark like you spent a week in the
Caribbean
the deluxe bronze mousse in ultra dark
whoo this is a new bottle so I haven't
used this specific bottle but I've used
this one a few times and oh my load you
will be dark but I personally use the
two hour Express on a kind of weekly
basis so the reason I am mentioning this
again is because loving tan now has a
shipping warehouse in the United States
which is so exciting they emailed me
like three days after my video like six
months ago and they told me about this
they told me like in a few months we're
gonna have shipping in America for your
American subscribers that Adal like
we're in the process of doing it right
now so for a long time coming I've been
waiting for this I can tell you guys
about it so they're now shipping it in
the US so all my American subscribers
you don't have to pay twenty five thirty
dollars for shipping from Australia
anymore and to top it off they gave me
an exclusive coupon code for you guys
that is just my name Jacqueline I
believe in all lowercase and that's
gonna get you free shipping and it's
gonna get you an exfoliating mitt I
don't know when that coupon code ends
but I will put all the details down
below I'll put the link I'll put the
coupon code and I'll tell you when it
ends the data ends down below as well
for you guys so I'm super excited about
that thank you - loving tan for doing
this it is so so sweet so the exploiting
myth that you guys ready to get gonna
get as like a gift with purchase I
believe is like a 20 to 25 dollar item
on their website so it's an awesome
coupon
it's like one of the best coupon codes
I've had for you guys like ever so I
hope that you guys enjoy do you want to
try out an amazing sunless tanner I'm
telling you it is bomb if you want to
see an entire video of like my tanning
routine of how I do everything from
beginning to end to achieve my sunless
tan let me know and I'll be happy to do
that for you guys of course I mentioned
this brand before but I have to mention
it again because she totally deserves it
and this is the blissful body body
butter she also creates body lotions and
other products but the body butter is my
favorite because I love moisturizing
rich body butter so this is definitely
my thing I mentioned this in a favorites
video a couple months back but I'm
mentioning it again because the woman
who creates these she asked me what's
your favorite scent ever if you could
have a body butter and I was like
peppermint
I love hermit so she created a
peppermint body butter for me that she
is now selling on her Etsy shop which is
so sweet she sent it to me and it smells
so good and it's not overly peppermint
because everything that she makes is
all-natural all organic and it's
handmade which I love and she's such an
awesome woman and she's very
inspirational she gives a part of all of
her proceeds to a women's organization
which is just awesome she's just a good
person so if you guys are interested in
an amazing body butter what I think is
the best body butter I've ever tried and
you want to give your money to a great
cause and a woman who's doing this by
herself and support another woman I
highly suggest the blissful body and the
peppermint one is amazing if you like
government if you don't like peppermint
you're not gonna like the peppermint one
I love it though it's not like overly
peppermint and it's not like when you
put on your body it's like cooling and
tingly it's very subtle but it's so
fresh and so yummy so that's the
blissful body all right you guys that
completes this video I hope that you
enjoy as always you know the drill leave
me a your favorite for the month of
March down below in the comments section
you know that's my favorite part I will
be talking to guys down there let me
know your requests what types of videos
