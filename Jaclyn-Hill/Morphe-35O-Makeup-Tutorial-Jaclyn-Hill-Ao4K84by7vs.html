doing a makeup tutorial using the morphe
35o palette and i'm so excited to be
doing this you guys because it is so
highly requested not to mention I have
been using this a palette off camera
literally almost every single time I do
my makeup I'll use at least a shade or
two because I'm so in love with it but I
haven't been able to do a tutorial on it
because the fact that has been sold out
for the past six to eight weeks so it is
finally back in stock and I wanted to
tie my video out so that the day came
back in stock is the day I feel my video
went live so that is why it has taken me
a long time to film this video but this
is the 35o palette right here as you can
see it is a fall I shadow
dream I mean at least it's my dream when
I saw this palette it was like huh like
you know the heart eyed emoji that was
me and a three-five oh when we first
connected it was a very very magical
moment past couple of months I feel like
morphe palettes have been like on
steroids like I am so ridiculously
impressed with how pigmented and smooth
and buttery it's been a while three
views that word I wouldn't sit here and
tell you that morphe use the exact same
quality is like makeup geek but I will
say that they are getting closer and
closer with every palette because this
palette really impresses me I did reach
out to morphe and i just straight-up
asked them if they would be willing to
give you guys a little bit more of a
discount code because of the fact that I
posted this on Instagram about two
months ago raving about how much I loved
it and coincidentally the palette sold
out literally like 15 or 20 minutes
later and I had so many disappointed
comments and tweets and even emails that
I asked them if they would be willing to
give you guys a little bit more of a
discount code to help make up for the
fact that I did post about it and then
it was just gone
so they did agree to give you guys 15%
off and this is only gonna last for five
days because they do not do 15% off my
normal discount code Jack Attack is only
for 10% and that is an affiliation code
but they are going to up it to an extra
5% for you guys just for a limited time
of 5 days for those of you who really
really wanted to get this palette but
you couldn't so I hope that that's is
exciting to you guys because I was
really excited when they agreed to it
because I know that tons of you were
really disappointed about not getting
this keep in mind with this palette
does sellout again it is a permanent
item so this pallet is not going to be
gone forever if it does sellout a couple
of times it will keep coming back it's
not limited edition so don't worry you
will be able to get you a little pause
on at some point so yeah that's a I'm
translator is anything else I have to
say oh yeah I did get a spray tan
earlier this week and you know I liked
the way it came out on my body my skin
on my face is not having it and I
literally have like alligator skin and I
have dry patches all over the place so
in the tutorial if you're wondering what
the heck is going on with her skin it's
just my spray tan it's all going to be
okay I'm sure my skin will be back from
on a couple of days I don't know why I'm
talking about such firstworldproblems
right now if you guys enjoyed the video
let's just get into it okay okay my eye
my spray tan gave me alligators and
blues are people dying in the world
Jacqueline hi everybody so today we are
gonna be starting off with our skin
first and I'm going to be priming using
the new Becca backlight priming filter
that's a mouthful I am loving this
primer because it gives your skin such
intense luminosity which is great for
someone like me who's looking for the
glow who has dry skin etc so once I have
that on I'm going to go in with
foundation and I'm going to be using the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick this has
been one of my favorites for the past
month or so so I'm going to put a line
on my chin and two lines on my cheeks
then I'm going to grab some mac fix+ and
a morphe foundation brush this is the
m43 9 I'm going to give it a couple of
spritz and then I'm going to just buff
this out this foundation is super creamy
it's very dewy so if you're oily I would
suggest probably staying away from this
one because it definitely is going to
give you a luminous dewy finish which is
why I love it because I feel it looks
very natural on my skin since I am dry
to normal so if you're looking for a
dewy foundation that lasts for a really
long time I would highly suggest this
one I love it and a little bit goes a
very long way and it's a medium coverage
which is great because recently I
haven't been into like the full intense
coverage like I used to so now I'm going
to conceal my under eye area and I'm
using the urban decay ultimate covers
concealer I think that's what it's
called about sure but you guys know what
I mean and I'll link it down below this
is my absolute favorite concealer at the
moment I honestly think it's my favorite
concealer of all time you guys it's just
so high coverage while still remaining
hydrating because sometimes a really
high coverage
dealer can get really dry on the under
eye area and make it look kind of creepy
and unsettle Evan more this is just like
the perfect amount of hydration while
still being full coverage so I love it I
am using a real techniques damp Beauty
sponge to blend this out and then I'm
going to go in and set the entire under
eye area using the Kat Von D shade light
palette this is her highlight contour
kit and these two highlight shades are
basically my favorite highlight shades
ever I really wish that she would sell
these individually and not just in the
kit because I would buy them in the pan
like hotcakes because I love the formula
of these so much so I'm going to make
sure I set that entire area in the V all
the way down the side of my nose up
towards the temple and then I'll also
dust it over the eye area that way at
prime is my eyes for shadow and shadow
will go on a lot smoother so now we're
going to go in with the morphe 35o and
we're gonna pick up this first shade
right here and then we're gonna mix it
with the other one that I'm pointing at
they don't have names so I'm just like
this one and this one it's like a light
brown and in a medium tone brown one is
very neutral and a little bit more is
like a camel
warm shade so going in initially with
the m4 4-1 brush this is by morphe it's
kind of a long haired blending brush I'm
going to put this right in my crease all
the way in the inner corner and blend
out all the way to the outer corner as
the product begins to leave my brush I'm
then going to go upwards and start
buffing this out towards my eyebrow then
I'm going to pick up this kind of burnt
reddish shade very warm one of my
favorites it reminds me of like a Mack
Brown script or a makeup geek Coco bear
and just going in with the exact same m4
for one brush I'm going to begin to put
that right over top of the first two
shades that we initially went in with
and I'm going to again go back and forth
and I'm really making sure I go deep
into that inner corner of the eye and
then all the way outward and then again
buffing it up and then I'm going to go
in with an even redder shade and I'm
going to mix it with this one in the
center of the palette this is going to
give me a really really rich red Brown
this is what's going to bring a lot of
that warmth in those red tones to this
look so if you don't like those red
tones go with a more medium brown in
this palette but you guys know that I
can't get enough so that is what I am
doing and I'm going in with an e 17
brush by morphe to initially pack on
this red brown color and the inner and
the outer corner and then I'm going in
with an m4 3
three and just making sure that it's all
blended out and we don't have harsh
lines this isse evan teen brush is great
if you're really looking for something
small and dense you can really precisely
pack on color but yet you still have
some blending control it's a little bit
bigger than a pencil brush so it still
has that blending shape to it which
makes it so great and ideal for
something like this so as you can see
I'm leaving the center of my lid blank
because we're going to go in and put
something in the center so now I'm going
to go in on those two dark Browns at the
very bottom I'm just gonna mix those
together because since I have 35 colors
I'm a guy might as well use as many as
possible so I just keep mixing them and
going back in with the exact same 17 I'm
going to begin to pack that super dark
color on the outer corner of the eye
because I just want it to be a little
bit more intensified out there then
going back in with the m43 three which
is just a great blending brush I'm going
to just go over that entire area all the
way from inner corner to outer corner to
make sure that it's all blended out we
don't have any harsh lines now picking
up this pale orange shade that reminds
me a lot of makeup geek chickadee I'm
using the same blending brush I'm just
going to put this at the very top of the
crease just make sure that everything is
nice and blended out and we have a
smooth transition and now I'm going to
pick up this very bottom intense oh my
gosh I don't even know what to refer to
the shade as it's just gorgeous I'm
wetting my brush with a little bit of
fix+ I'm going to begin to pack this
color on so I wanted to be super
metallic make sure that when you wet
your brush with fix+ that you don't get
it soaked otherwise it's going to kind
of defeat the purpose and you're not
gonna be able pack that much product on
so just a little spritz will do and then
you'll get that really intense foiled
pigmented look that I am going for so
this shade as you can see is super
Orange it's super warm it reminds me a
lot of makeup geek flamethrower which is
one of their foiled eyeshadows
especially when you wet your brush with
fix+
it looks like a foiled shadow which is
why I use fix+ so often because you can
completely change your eyeshadow look
with just a spritz of fix+ now I'm going
to pick up a super dark color at the
bottom of the palette either one of
these shades would do and I'm going to
use a sigma e 15 definer brush to pack
on this shade onto the lower lash line
and I'm literally going to draw this
color from the outer corner to the inner
corner of my eye using this definer
brush and then once we have that intense
dark shade on I will go in and blend
this out so it's not so harsh of course
otherwise it looks like you drew it on
with a sharpie so
picking up a little bit more of this
burnt red shade and a pencil brush I'm
going to just blend this out from the
outer corner to the inner corner I
really like my undereyes to personally
be smoky I think that they opened up my
eyes they bring more attention to your
eye color and they just give you like a
really intense glowy smoky look so I
always really blend that out on the
lower lash line so now I'm going to fill
in my brows nothing special I'm using
the Anastasia brow Wiz in the shade
taupe Anasazi as brow is is my favorite
pencil of all time when it comes to
brows when I switched from the Mac one
to the Anastacio one it was just like oh
yeah that having gates opened because I
loved it so much so I am lining my
waterline with a vanilla shade pencil
but I'm actually going to take that off
in a minute or two and replace it with a
black because I realized I wasn't
feeling myself so I'm gonna go in with
this highlight shade and a teeny tiny
little brush this is an e36 from morphe
and it's ideal for highlighting your
inner corner of your eyes I've been
loving it recently it's the little
things in life I swear to God literally
so after I highlight my inner corner I'm
gonna pop just a little bit of that same
shade only at the high point of the brow
and then kind of blend it downward onto
the shadow itself now I'm just going to
give my lashes a coat of mascara because
I am going to prep them for lashes don't
feel like you need to wear lashes but
I'm a last girl and I wear them all the
time so I'm gonna pop them on today I am
using the new Sofia lashes by Sofia
Cheng who is known as fashionista 8:04
here on instagram she collaborated with
vellore to make these lashes and I have
to say they're one of my favorite styles
by them I love them so much and I will
definitely be showing you guys them
again because they are so gorgeous
perfect for a smoky eye I've been
wearing them with liner without liner on
a day-to-day basis on a smokey basis so
I am all about these lashes right now
congratulations girl so I am mass
carrying my look mascara ring I am
putting mascara on my lower lashes and
then I'm going in with some eyeliner
this is the ardency in eyeliner and
black because I realized I was not
liking that vanilla liner I wanted
something a little bit smoky err so I
went over it with a black kohl a little
bit and just completely covered it up
and made it darker and smokier which I
liked way better and then I go back in
with that same Sigma II 15 to finer
brush and just kind of smoke it out and
blend out that liner since you can't see
what I'm doing so I'm looking straight
down I'm explaining it to you instead so
now for cheeks I'm going to be using
a cosmetic sculpting powder in the shade
shade stirrer which I've talked about a
few times because I love it so much and
I am using the NARS
eita brush which I have reef all inand
love with recently and I'm going to be
contouring my cheeks and I'm doing kind
of a high contour today meaning I am
sculpting starting a little bit higher
by the ear and bringing it down at a
more intense decline down by the mouth
because I wanted to give that kind of
sharp intense contour and then I'm just
going to blend that around on the
forehead and I'm going to pick up some
of the Laura Mercier translucent powder
and then I am using this intense
sculpting brush from morphe and what I'm
going to do is put this powder right
underneath my contour and I'm going to
blend it all the way down on the rest of
the face by the jawbone this is going to
set that powder so that I'm sorry set
that foundation so that it doesn't wear
off throughout the day because my
foundation always leaves the lower half
of my face because I'm like leaning on
my arm or something and then I'm going
to go in and blend all of that out and
just immediately erase it so that
everything is nice and set and sharp
sharp and then I'm going to go in with
some blush and this is the NARS luster
blush and I'm using the morphe e for
blush brush I love this blush I don't
know how old it is I don't even know if
it's still available but if it is I will
link it down below if I can find it but
I have been loving it and now I'm going
to highlight my cheeks using what do you
what do you know champagne pop I'm so
surprised I'm so surprised that I'm
using champagne pop aren't you using a
morphe M 501 I'm going to just dust this
all over the very high point of my
cheeks and then blending it downward
today I'm keeping it more on the high
points and not so much on the apples
I usually blend it down there but not
today so I'm going to go in with a very
nude lip to begin I wanted to show you
guys options so this is OCC lip tar in
the shade interlace and I'm going to go
over it with one of my favorite lip
glosses at the moment which is NARS
Chelsea girls so you can see what this
look would look like if you chose to do
a nude lip I personally like this I
think it's very pretty but I wanted to
go something a little bit more dramatic
because I rarely do bold and bold but
recently I've been having fun with these
fall looks so I'm going to show you what
it looks like when we go with a bold lip
and bold eyes so I am using the
Anastasia lip tar lip pink I'm sorry in
the shade vamp and I'm going to put that
all over my entire lips as normal
I'm not going to go too hard on the
center of the lip though because I'm
about to cover that up with a little bit
of persimmon and I am going to just dab
this right in the center of the lip and
tapping motions on the bottom and then
I'm going to take my finger once I have
this tapped all over the center and I'm
going to begin to just kind of balance
my finger up and down on my lips to
blend this out we're doing an ombre lip
but I didn't want it to be too intense
or over-the-top so I'm just pouting and
buffing this out with the tip of my
finger and I want the most intense of
this brightness to be in the very very
center of the lip like you just got done
sucking on a strawberry that's how it's
supposed to look so once we've done that
I'm going to set my face with Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray and
this look is complete so I hope you guys
enjoy thank you so much for watching I
love you and I'll see you guys soon bye
oh yeah like a normal mom or huh it's
all very fun the guides highball so I
want to hear about it
okay mail took a butthole oh my god
hey my going to be doing and uh it's
like Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
