a tutorial on this look that I'm wearing
right here I honestly had no idea
calling it yet but I just feel like I
had to do this look for you guys that is
my dog digging to China I just got like
I had this look for you guys because I
have been wearing this look for almost 5
years and the other day I was applying
this look and I was like do I know how
to tutorial on this so I went and looked
in my videos and I was shocked shocked
to see that I did not have a tutorial on
this look anywhere on my youtube channel
especially because I've been wearing the
silk and it's been one of my go-to looks
for about five years which is way before
my youtube started so anyways long story
short I'd like eyes how to do this for
you guys it's beautiful I've done so
many from people all skin tones all eye
colors are going to look great with this
look and it's easy to achieve I love
wearing this up I don't want to do
something super colorful or super
neutral but I still want to be smoky if
that makes sense I love it it's a go-to
look for me so I really hope you guys
enjoy it just as much as I do
so yeah thank you so much for watching I
love you guys and I'll talk to you soon
bye hey guys so first thing I'm doing
today is just going to put some eye
drops in my eyes so they're not so red
and bloodshot and then of course I have
to fake cry because I have eyedrops
running down my face if you guys want to
use the most amazing eye drops of life
go and get rotos they feel like icebergs
are stabbing you in the eyes and it's
awesome now I am just going to prime my
eyes using Mac Pro Longwear concealer
you can use whatever you're comfortable
with just make sure those peepers are
primed then I'm going to go in with
makeup geek Peach Smoothie I used to use
maximo a silk a lot for this look so if
you have that eye shadow it will work
just the same I'm going to use a sigma
e-40 blending brush just to dust this in
my crease area I'm mainly focusing on
the outer corner of the crease but I'm
also going to buff it inward just to
help with the blending process later on
then I'm going to go in with Mac saddle
eyeshadow this is one of my favorite
Browns ever taking an e25 I'm going to
buff that in the lower part of my crease
and then slightly work it upward again
mainly focusing on that outer corner
then I'm going to go in with Mac satin
taupe this is such a gorgeous eyeshadow
and it truly is one of those eyeshadows
that looks good on everybody it's a
little bit of silver a little bit of
purple a little bit of pewter a little
bit of taupe it's beautiful so with an E
55 brush I'm just going to pack that all
over the lid there's nothing really
special
about this part make sure you really get
it in that inner corner and don't leave
any spaces once you have that on the lid
I always suggest going back with any
blending brush I'm using the same one
that I applied saddle with just to dust
that out so that you have no harsh lines
if you do this every single step you'll
never have any harsh lines and no issues
blending then I'm going to use sketch
this is such a gorgeous purple eyeshadow
from Mac it is my favorite purple
eyeshadow out there it is just the most
gorgeous color of wine I think that
everybody needs this color in their
collection using a makeup geek pencil
brush I'm going to pack that all over
the outer corner and I'm not really
doing it with any rhyme or reason I'm
just packing it out there because then I
will go back in with an e25 and pick up
more sketch on this blending brush and
then really concentrate on buffing that
out with this brush I personally like my
smokey eyes to come up a little bit
above my crease area so I'm just going
to ever-so-slightly start blending that
upward I'm go back and forth with sketch
on one brush and saddle on the other
brush and just slowly blend it up I
think that when you buff it out and
really blow out a smoky eye it makes the
eyes look open if you sometimes keep
those dark colors too low you can look a
little squinty and sometimes tire so I
like to buff it out a little bit higher
than the crease just so I look a little
bit more awake with those dark colors on
my eyelid then I'm going to go in with
Maybelline eye studio gel liner and
blackest black this is my favorite gel
liner ever which is awesome because it's
from the drugstore so what I do is I
trace out my eye liner starting from my
wing and then I just fill it in I am
using an e 65 brush to do my liner a lot
of you guys asks so I will link it down
below
e 65 then I'm going to take any eye
cream and a q-tip and just clean up that
under-eye area so we have a fresh start
when we go with our foundation and
concealer and we don't have any shadow
hanging out down there I'm also going to
apply false lashes
I am using lash in the city by velour oh
look at what a difference it makes to
these eyes so pretty then I'm going to
go in with Mac shroom I have been using
this color as a brow highlight for years
and years and years and I've gone
through so many of these shadows it's
insane it's the most universal shade for
most skin tones for a brow highlight
it's just beautiful and it completes
this look especially a smokey eye it
ties it all together then I'm going to
go in with my favorite foundation
Giorgio Armani luminous silk using a
sigma f80 as always and I'm just going
to buff this
all over the face area I am using shades
6.5 right now which as you can see is
much darker than my face but it does
match my neck which is why I use a
foundation that's darker than my face so
I'm going to buff that all over and then
I'm going to use Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and nw20
and NW 25 they need to make an NW 22.5
for me because I'm sitting right in
between okay Wow needy and then I was
going to go ahead and blend this out
using an X 64 this is a concealer brush
from Sigma I know I usually always use
the f-86 but I've been changing it up
recently and I have been loving at this
concealer brush all month long okay
moving on stop talking about your
favorites over here Jacqueline I am now
going to set my under eye concealer
using a highlighting powder from the
Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit I
have to set my under eye area if I don't
I am doomed from the get-go I will
crease within a couple of hours so I'm
also going to just dab that highlighting
powder on the chin and the Cupid's bow
area just to even everything out this
might look a little bit bright right now
but that's okay because once we go in
with the contour and the blush and all
that jazz it will all come together I
promise you then I'm going to go in and
just fill in my eyebrows again using a
Nastasia product the brow is as always I
will link my brow video down below
browsers aren't fun to watch them get
filled in like let's get real it's just
not a good time we like seeing other
things than brows so moving on I'm going
to contour using the NARS eita brush and
yeah hallelujah the NARS Eder brush is
back in stock so I will link it down
below at the places that you can get it
hopefully it will not sell out again
soon so I am just doing basic contouring
nothing special sculpting out the
cheekbones and then just hitting that
hairline in the temple area and make
sure you blend it out so it doesn't look
choppy then I'm going to go in with the
makeup geek blush in the shade
spellbound I think this has become my
favorite blush in this entire palette it
is a warm tone pink it is so gorgeous I
have definitely been using it almost
every single day it's just perfect for
summer I'm also using a makeup geek
brush and this is the face buffer brush
I believe it's called I will put it down
below but I love it for applying blush
then I'm going to go in it with the
bobbi brown shimmer brick in the shade
beige oh get ready to see the beauty
it's like we need a moment of silence
just just look
oh my gosh yes yes this is the most
ridiculously beautiful highlighter I
don't know what has taken me so long to
come across it it is so gorgeous so I'm
highlighting the cheekbones putting a
little down the chin and the nose just
to make myself extra dewy and glowy
because I can't say no to this bad boy
then I'm going to go in with sketch and
a flat definer brush and I'm going to
pack this in that entire lower lash line
area from inner corner to outer corner
and then I'm just going to buff this out
with a pencil brush and using some
saddle eyeshadow just to blend that
under eye area you can make this as
intense as you want you can add even
more sketch and then you can line the
waterline with a Kohl pencil and make it
extra smoky but I just thought that we
would stop there I am going to just
touch that inner corner for some
highlight and I did use makeup geek ice
queen then I'm going to just coat my
bottom lashes using mac gigablack lash
and I realized I wasn't in the frame so
I've moved myself up a little bit then
for the lips I am only going to be using
lime crimes Coquette this is one of my
favorite lipsticks ever I just think
it's such a beautiful nude and I finally
restocked it mine completely broke and
melted into pieces and so I just got it
in the mail so I was excited to finally
use my baby again
so yes that is going to complete our
look I am just going to go ahead and set
everything by using the Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray any setting
spray works
I always just suggest you set that so
you're good to go thank you for watching
you guys I love you so much and I'll see
you soon
