together it's like making me feel
uncomfortable
oh hey guys over today's video I'm going
to be doing something that I've never I
cannot believe that I've never done this
video before I could have sworn that I
did this and a couple of weeks ago I had
someone tweet me saying Jacqueline
please do your all-time favorite
drugstore beauty products and I was like
I've done that though and I searched my
channel and I was like what I don't know
why I thought I had done this video so
with that being said the second I saw
that tweet it's been all my list of
things to film because there are so many
great products that I personally love
from the drugstore and today is going to
be only drugstore dedicated so this is
not going to be like an affordable one
where it would include like things like
morphe or like makeup geek this is
strictly things that you can find at
your CVS Walgreens Rite Aid whatever it
may be Target that kind of thing just
drugstore if you guys want to see a
separate video where I talk about like
my favorite affordable makeup products
you know like maybe under $15 or
whatever it may be I would totally be
open to doing that because it would
definitely be like a different range of
things so today I have the things that I
personally genuinely love from the
drugstore I was not going to add
anything in here but I was not like
fangirl about so things I put in here
are things that I love just as much as
high-end makeup that you can find at
your local drugstore so let's go ahead
and get started okay so let's start off
with the face primer foundations
concealers of that jazz by the way I'm
only going to be showing you that my
absolute top favorites I'm not going to
show you things that like oh I like this
one too I'm going to show you like this
is my favorites this is what I can't
live without from the drugstore so first
off I'm sure you knew this was coming if
you're familiar with my videos this is
the L'Oreal magic lumi light infusing
primer absolute favorite primer from the
drugstore of all time I have repurchased
this three times
I believe I've bought on it I love it so
much and it's so small and compact it's
great for travel even though you're not
gonna be throwing in your bag on a
day-to-day basis but when you travel
it's great for travel this was my
favorites like light infusing luminous
primer until Becca recently came out
with theirs but this is a great
it's really neutral very vanilla it's
not too golden it's my topaz or too
yellow which I like that they kind of
stay safe because it'll work for a lot
of skin tones it's just so gorgeous you
can wear without makeup wear under your
makeup as a primer or my favorite way to
do it is mix it with the foundations
like a foundation cocktail pump a
foundation a pump a primer mix it
together whip it up put all over your
face and it just looks so gorgeous
because it allows the primer to shine
through a little bit more but you still
get the priming power so if you're
looking for like extra hydration and
luminosity it's a great tip I learned
that tip from a senior artist at Mac
when I was working in Chicago and I have
loved that tip ever since so my number
one ride-or-die foundation is hands-down
the L'Oreal True Match Lumi the reason
that I say lumi is my favorite one is
because I personally am always looking
for hydration luminosity if you're oily
the original L'Oreal True Match is
amazing just as amazing is this it just
depends on what your skin is and what
your needs are so for me I love anything
with luminosity and what I love about
this is it's a drugstore foundation that
has no glitter in it but it truly gives
you dewy
luminosity I love it so much I have
repurchase this I'm not kidding eight to
ten times it used to be the only
foundation I wore for like a year and a
half straight it's just gorgeous it is a
sheer to medium coverage so if you're
younger and you're looking for like a
great foundation from the drugstore
that's just going to kind of enhance
your skin make it look very hydrated and
fresh I would really recommend that one
because it's not going to be super duper
cakey or too intense next foundation is
the same brand same thing basically but
just different it's just different and
it's the L'Oreal Lumi True Match cushion
now this one it is an actual cushion
like a little lily pad right here that
you see you just press on it and the
foundation comes out
I am shocked by how much product
actually comes out of this pad you can
get a full coverage very easily this
does make your skin look so healthy so
hydrated it gives you such a gorgeous
shine I don't want to use the word shine
because then you think of like oily but
it just makes your skin look so healthy
I have to say between these two my
personal favorite is the cushion which I
feel like almost feels sad because like
the Lummi was like my ride-or-die for so
many years but you know with every brand
time goes on they perfect things and
they make them better and better and I
think that this is my number one
favorite foundation from the drugstore
ever I just I love it so much one of the
best foundations so I only have one
concealer for you guys and the reason
being is because I've tried several
concealers from the drugstore and I just
have not fallen in love with any of them
except this one right here now there is
one that I have not tried that's by
Maybelline I believe that things too
like Maybelline master something I need
to go buy that one and try except heard
it's really good but I haven't got
around to it anyways this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer ivory
purchased this in many times it's my
number one favorite because it's the
right amount of coverage it's not too
oily and it's not too dry you really
really love the consistency of this one
it's nice and sheer but it's got
buildable coverage this would be a great
concealer for a young girl if you are
trying to go to the drugstore and find
yourself a good foundation and concealer
and let's say you have normal skin or
dry skin I would recommend these two for
you right here if you are oily I would
recommend this with the original L'Oreal
True Match that's just my opinion I
think they're just beautiful I would say
that the Maybelline fit me would be a
inexpensive dupe for the NARS radiant
creamy concealer because it reminds me a
lot of that okay so now we're going to
talk about bronzer and blushes I was
going to mention the butter bronzer that
I just recently raved about my favorites
video but I feel like I can't put that
like my all-time favorite drugstore
products because I've only owned it for
a month you know I'm saying and like
everything else in here I've owned for a
long time like a year at least so I want
to talk about all-time favorite products
today so this is a bronzer by the brand
Jane and it's in the shade inspire
I love this bronzer this is one of the
only bronzers that I have found at the
drugstore that truly applies like butter
it just applies so beautifully I've
never had an issue that separating or
breaking up or applying like you know
chunky and separated it just goes on so
beautiful it's a great color I know if
you can see that in the back of my hand
but what I like about it is that it's
not too dark it's got like a very
neutral undertone and it's not so dark I
have to be afraid to apply it when I am
looking more fair because I do self tan
so sometimes they'll be darker sometimes
will be lighter and this always works as
a bronzer on me know
my color but if I'm fair I don't have to
be scared to go in with this shade
because it's not like too dark or too
orange like Mac give me Sun if I'm fair
like today I couldn't use Mac give me
Sun so I'm like that's too orange for me
today so that's what I love about this
one it just applies so beautifully so
the first blush that I absolutely have
to mention I feel like is everybody's
favorite blush from the drugstore
because it is so good and this is the
Milani baked blush in the shade Luminoso
I have repurchased this two times I
absolutely love it there was a minute
there on my channel where I was using
this so much that people were commenting
like Jacqueline enough with Luminoso
give us something else I was like but
why it's so beautiful I became like
Milani obsessed and I bought like I went
out and got like every single baked
blush she'll think I got a triable
they're so amazing well I have to say
Luminoso is a diamond in the rough for
me personally because I feel like this
is unlike anything else it's so
beautiful
it's got that gorgeous peachy pink
golden undertone glow it doesn't have
chunky shimmer it just oh it's so
beautiful as far as my favorite brand of
blushes at the drugstore I would have to
say NYX because like I said Milani
Luminoso is a beautiful blush but I feel
like not all of Melanie's blushes are as
good as Luminoso whereas nyx I can
always count on them to come through
with their great blushes they're always
going to be creamy their goal is going
to be high pigment they're always going
to be easy to apply and I have three
they're my top favorites now I own I
think six to eight of them but these are
like my 3 faves and I feel like these
are the three blushes that like
basically like this is just the three
colors you need in a collection and the
first one right here is I'm confused by
NYX because every blush has two names
like this is called ethereal / sublime
so they all have two names which is kind
of comforting but I will just put
everything down below so it makes sense
you can read it but this one is a
gorgeous baby pink like we'll call pivot
status isn't that nice the second one is
coral dream / coral intense I love this
color
it's similar to this one but it's
definitely got way more coral in it this
is my favorite one for sure coral
intense and then the last one is a
bittersweet slash dough of Amer don't
were not really sure this one is a
really great Mavi shade
as you can see they all have a lot of
pigment they're all creamy they were all
the easy put on they're not going on
like patchy or like rough on my skin
they're not dry just really beautiful
and right here this blush is such a
great everyday Bobby blush if you're
just trying to find a great blush from
the drugstore just to be able to like
dust on the apples of your cheeks and
you know it's always gonna look with
everything I would recommend a shade
like this right here unless you're
extremely fair because something like
this will basically look good with
whatever eye color and lip color that
you choose to do because it's just a
nice really pretty neutral the last
blush item that I have is a palette by
elf I believe there's a lighter one
since this one says dark I know there
were two so this is the darker one and
it looks like nice oh my god wait until
I swatch them the pigmentation is out of
this world it really is beautiful I
purchase this initially because a
subscriber told me that I needed it in
my life on Twitter so I was like doesn't
say more look at how gorgeous and creamy
these blushes are like the way they
apply this is the first my hand has like
a little bit of makeup remover I use
like a makeup wipe to wipe off my hand a
second ago so you might not apply
perfectly but that's that first one
right there so pretty the second one is
like a really gorgeous pink with oh so
pretty with like violet undertones and
then we have this deep can you be can
you believe how pigmented these are
they're insane and then the very last
one is the only one that I'm not crazy
about in the palette because it does
have actual glitter in it and I try to
stay clear of glitter in my blushes when
you apply it though you don't see it
that much but still these three blushes
I love the shades and it's so great and
the small compact I love it so if you're
looking for a blush palette look no
further girl okay let's move on to eyes
now the first thing for eyes I can't
live without this this has been my one
and only gel liner that I have used for
years there's nothing that compares this
this is my favorite gel liner in the
world it doesn't clump up it's black as
coal it applies so easily it doesn't
transfer it's not too oily like it is
just it's the best I'm telling you like
I don't care you could offer me like the
most expensive eyeliner in the entire
world and I'm gonna turn that down and
I'm always going to grab the Maybelline
eye studio gel liner this is my favorite
gel
in the world I'm telling you if you do
gel liner trust me you're going to be
obsessed it's the best I have two
mascaras there hands down my favorite
number one is the L'Oreal voluminous
carbon black you can see mine is
completely worn off because I use it all
the time
I mean purchase this like crazy almost
every time I go into a drugstore I
always grab the L'Oreal carbon black and
repurchase it I love this because the
fact that it is so black a lot of pro
makeup artists keep this in their kit
because the fact that it is such a great
mascara for such an inexpensive price
and it is so black so for instance when
I have 5 false lashes sometimes I'll be
like oh I can really see my natural
lashes because they don't look black
enough well what I will do is grab the
carbon black and I was going there and
I'll just kind of flick her around and
cover it up and it's good to go because
it is so black it's amazing and the
brush itself so easy to apply this is my
favorite mascara to apply on days where
I'm just applying mascara what I will do
is go over like first coat I will use
with this second coat I will go in with
Rimmel lash accelerator I also love to
use this one on my lower lashes for a
while there this was the only mascara I
was doing on my lower lashes because
it's got a brush that's really easy to
get under there it's not like a big huge
bulky brush and it kind of tapers in in
the inner and outer corner and is
fattest in the center so it's easy to
kind of get in there and do what you got
to do underneath there I really love
this one as well but the voluminous one
number one and then this is close second
so as far as eyeshadows go I have one
eyeshadow specifically from the
drugstore that I just can't not like I I
can't believe how beautiful they are
they're so luxurious they're so easy to
work with they're just creamy they're
amazing I will say the Maybelline quads
are some of my favorite shadows the one
that come in like the four shadow is
like a little black quad with like the
clearcase on the front I love those I
don't have any right now they do tend to
break easily so I've owned about three
or four of them and they've all broken
but I do really like those whenever I
see take a really beautiful color of
them I will pick it up because they are
really good quality but overall my
number one favorite shadows from the
drugstore are the L'Oreal infallible
shadows oh my gosh they are so luxurious
and so buttery and so easy to work with
they're just look at this color I've
used this before I've raved about these
before you see me talk about everything
in this video before but this is just
like this color get ready to see the
swatch because honestly like
tell me that this is not one of the most
beautiful shadows that you seen look at
our color are you kidding me it's
gorgeous so this is the shade amber rush
and then this color right here this is
another infallible in the shade golden
emerald are you ready look at the screen
tell me that this is not ridiculous oh I
feel like I've done a tutorial with this
but I'm not wait no wait if I haven't
done it tutorial at this I'm going to at
some point because I love this color I
know I've worn it several times but I
don't know if I've done a makeup look on
it okay I love these colors so much they
look like foiled eyeshadows they've got
so much Sheen they're so beautiful okay
so now we are going to move on to my
favorite which is lips I'm going to
start off with my number one favorite
lip product from the drugstore of all
time and these are the NYX butter
glosses oh my god and I have to be
honest I'm a little envious they're
called butter glosses because I would
love to have a gloss called butter gloss
are you kidding me that's my favorite
word ever so I have four colors are my
top four colors I just love so much I am
wearing one of them on my lips today
this is the shade Eclair right here I
will swatch each one for you Eclair is
just a really nice baby pink with some a
lilac undertone in it super pretty the
second one is creme brulee this is my
favorite nude it is so pretty as you can
see right there has got a little bit of
peach in it which I like my news to have
a little bit peach in it personally the
third one is maple blondie this is my
sister's favorite one I just know that
because she wears all the time it's so
pretty I love that color and then last
but not least is the shade angel food
cake and this is just a really gorgeous
kind of Mavi in neutral they're just so
beautiful their sheer without being like
too sheer they've got the right amount
of pigment without being sticky or
without being drying or tacky they feel
like butter on the lips what more you
could you asked for it my favorite
drugstore lip product right there so as
far as glosses go my second favor would
have to be the maybelline color elixir I
think that's what these are called hold
on hold on make sure oh my god it was
right
yes color elixir I have these two shades
right here I don't know what happened I
owned like almost all of the shades and
they disappear and I only own like three
or four of them now but these are my top
two the ones I've used the most the
first one is the shade luxury in a lilac
and it looks like this very very creamy
that's the only way I can explain the
way they feel on the lips
definitely not buttery but more like a
cream or a creme and this one is the
shade nude illusion which is just a
gorgeous perfect nude shade right there
such a pretty shade so those are my two
favorites definitely with the Maybelline
elixirs now as far as lipsticks go my
number one favorite lipstick like brand
from the drugstore is Maybelline first
shirt I'm going to start off with these
two right here the first one is born
with it and this is such a nice neutral
it's got a little bit of a pink
undertone in it it's a little on the
sheer side but it's not too sheer it'll
still cover up the color of your lips
it'll still give you pigment you scent
have to go over a couple of times next
one is vivid rose and I've won this one
quite a few times because it's such a
gorgeous pop of color
SuperDuper pigmented it's not matte but
it's not a super creamy one either like
the other ones it's like right in
between and then these two right here
came with special collections but I just
got a line to look to make sure and
they're both still available because I
want to talk about something that wasn't
available anymore
this one is the shade peach poppy and I
love this shade because it's like such a
gorgeous peach coral shade but it's not
too bright or too dark
it's got like that kind of pale peachy
undertone it's super super pretty and
this one came out with a special
collection I feel like it was called the
Vivid's collection honestly that's what
I think I might be totally off but this
one right here at the last from
Maybelline and this is the shade nude
lust and this again such a pretty
neutral right here I'm going to show you
one last lipstick from the drugstore
obviously everything from here and here
is from the drugstore and this one is
another nude that I love this is by
Milani I love milania's packaging I love
the gold packaging you can see the color
of the bottom and then it's got the name
right there and the name is nude creme
nude creme is right here so you can see
the difference between all three of
these neutrals I
this one I feel like any time I ever
want you to new from the drugstore I
always grab nude creme from Milani
that's always the shade that I use I
know I've used this in a couple of
tutorials before and she's a really
pretty nude without being too nude it's
still got some color in it so you don't
look like you just ate like a powdered
sugar doughnut the last product I have
from the drugstore that is not
technically makeup but I thought I would
include it because after all this makeup
you gotta buy something to take it all
off with and these are right there
makeup wipes in the drugstore and I used
to use these like crazy back in the day
and then my skin start developing a lot
of sensitivity and this was back when I
used to use like um a ton of Mario
Badescu skin products I use these makeup
wipes every single day and my skin is
developed a crazy sensitivity I got so
much texture on my skin I talked about
it here on YouTube and I just changed
everything and I cut these out of my
life because of that sensitivity but
just recently I repurchase them from the
drugstore and I've been using them for
the past week or so which is funny
because the past couple weeks I've had
texture all over this cheek but I
started using this app that texture
showed up um and I just love them
they're my favorite drugstore makeup
wipes they are by ponds they're called
the evening sued wet cleansing
towelettes with chamomile and white tea
so if you're looking for a really good
makeup white from the drugstore that is
my personal favorite that's what I have
been using right now it looks like this
it's got like little holes in it but
anyways that completes this video
oh that completes this video you guys I
really hope you enjoy I'm super happy
