ah
hey guys so today I am finally going to
be filming my birthday smokey eye makeup
tutorial what the heck was that this is
actually the exact look that I was
filming when my camera broke on me a
month ago so this is the look that I
wore on my birthday which was forever
ago July 20th was my birthday um but I
asked you guys on Twitter if you would
still like to see the smokey eye that I
wore my birthday and it was one of my
most fits well it was one of my most
favorite tweets of all time so I took
that as a very strong yes so how does
exactly what I'm doing for you so I hope
that you guys enjoy this look super
modest definitely something that you
would want to wear to church maybe on
grandma's house for tea I'm glad to make
myself laugh that's what's important
right so as I said this is what I wore
this year I just really want to do
something super dark and smoky and
golden and just glam it over the top
because it's your birthday could you
ever you want on your birthday like you
can use red lipstick as I saw on your
birthday people today yeah I go work sly
it's gonna require a lot of blending I
think I actually cramped up at one point
from the blending process but that just
shows that you're doing your job right
we should get paid to blend why are we
not getting paid to blend that's what I
want to know because it's a full-time
job I think the next tutorial that I'm
going to do is going to be a very fall
vampy look so let me know if that's
that's okay with you I love you guys so
much thank you for watching I'm so happy
to be back okay I'm done bye don't mind
me but I'm gonna go ahead and cover a
blemish on the tip of my nose so I don't
look like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
and let's move on oh I feel like I was
lying to you guys if you didn't know
that I was in pajama pants it's all
smoking mirrors people it's all smoke
Amir's first thing we're gonna do is go
in with the Kat Von D shade light eye
palette I'm going to use this pale
peachy shade right here all the way to
the right and I'm going to be going in
with a sigma e35 brush and using this as
a transition shade we're going to dust
it all the way from the inner to the
outer corner and the upper crease area
then we are going to go in with this
medium tone very neutral Brown and I'm
gonna do the exact same motion as we did
with the peachy shade and I'm going to
go back and forth in the crease as you
can see with this one I'm going to start
off a little bit lower in the crease and
then work it up just to give more depth
we're going to continue just to pile
colors on on top of colors just to give
more depth and more dimension dimension
and make sure to blend it out then I'm
going to pick
this warm brown color and I'm going to
do the exact same thing once again as
you can see staying in the lower crease
as opposed to before we are in the upper
crease I'm going to put this a little
bit lower and then once there's less
product on the brush then we will go
upward that's the key to blending is
keeping the dark shades low and then as
les is on the brush then going up higher
and higher to blend everything out I
picked up a little bit more of that
neutral brown shade I'm going in with
the morphe M 4-3-3 blending brush and
I'm going to go once again back and
forth to really deepen this and darken
it because next we're going to be going
in with a black so I when I get this to
my liking of depth now we're going to go
in with the Inglot gel liner in the
black shade which is literally the inky
Asst blackest slipperiest gel liner of
all time as you can see right here it is
so intense so just going in with a small
brush a pencil brush whatever you want
whatever is going to work you could use
your finger if you really wanted to the
key is to keep this on the lower lid and
try as hard as you can not to extend the
crease so as you can see once I'm in
that crease area I'm going to kind of
dab back and forth this brush is not
going to allow you to blend it's just
going to allow you to place it on the
lid and then we're going to grab a
blending brush and we're going to go in
and we are really going to work at
blending this out so I'm going to grab
that black shade right there once again
from the kat von d palette and I'm going
to go in with a trusty Sigma e25 pack
that black all over my lid and then
begin the blending process this is going
to take you a little bit time don't get
frustrated continuing going back and
forth back and forth in tiny little
circular motions and then when she'll
wiper motions stick in that crease and
make sure that you keep it low don't
really allow your hand to go high
because you don't want to really extend
that crease at this point otherwise
that's what will make you look like you
got punched in the face and that's what
everyone fears with smokey eyes then I'm
going to go back in with the same morphe
and 4-3-3 and a little bit more that
brown and just continue the same
blending process back and forth back and
forth this will keep that super blended
but also lower on the lid so it doesn't
go up to your eyebrows now I'm going to
just take any makeup wipe and just clean
it up this is why we do our eyes first
and not our foundation when we're doing
looks like this because using black and
blending like a madwoman can get a
little messy and you will have follow on
your cheeks so that's why I do it this
way now I'm going to take a little bit
of amber lights eyeshadow by Mac this is
not necessary but I am just doing this
because it gives just a little
more pop of gold and since we're going
to go on with a gold glittery pigment
this is just going to really highlight
that area and continue the flow of that
gold but once again not necessary if you
don't own this shadow or gold eyeshadow
skip the step you'll be fine
now I'm going to go in with the star of
the show and this is Mac reflects
antique gold and I'm going to be using
the lit glitter glue I don't know if
it's actually called glitter glue but
that's what it is it's a glitter glue
and it's the best glitter glue on the
market it's incredible I dipped my Mac
242 brush in it and then I just dip it
right into the glitter and voila just
stick it right on the eyes it is the
best glitter glue in the entire world
and this reflects antique gold by Mac I
bought this originally when I was 18
years old and it doesn't even look like
it's been used and I've used it at least
thirty times I used to use it on clients
all the time it is just so beautiful
anyways now we are going to move on to
the face and I'm going to be priming my
skin with makeup forever hydrating
primer but you use whatever works for
you and then I'm going to be using
foundation and today I'm using the cover
FX natural finish oil-free foundation
and this bad boy is thick so a little
bit goes a long way you definitely get
your money worth with this foundation as
you can see I am going a little bit
darker than my face I am matching my
foundation to my neck I never match my
foundation in my face because I
exfoliate three to four times a week in
my face is always a four shades lighter
than my body so I always match my
foundation to my neck and I am currently
using the morphe what is this m43 nine
foundation brush which has been my
current favorite for the past couple of
months because it's rounded and it's so
fat if the job done so quick and blends
everything out so beautifully I'm going
to be concealing with my favorite
concealer which is the Urban Decay
weightless concealer and oh my god I'm
almost gone and I need to go get a
backup right now because this is not
happening I'm using the Real Techniques
sponge to blend everything out this
sponge is everything you guys it's
amazing and then I'm going to go in and
set everything with Laura Mercier
translucent powder using that same Real
Techniques sponge that is damp I'm going
to dip it into the powder and I'm going
to begin to set my under eye concealer I
usually never do this method so this is
very new for me because I like to be
very dewy but today I'm going to mattify
myself which is a big change I'm going
to use a method that we are calling
cooking
or baking whatever you want to call it
tomato tomahto it's the same thing we're
going to let this powder sit on our
under-eye area for as long as possible
while we move on and do other things and
then we will come back to it in a moment
it is a Kat Von D kind of day I did not
realize this I'm using the Kat Von D
shade light is the highlight palette I
don't know it's called the shade light
face palette baby and I'm going to be
contouring my cheeks I started off with
the Kat Von D brush but then I switched
over to the e30 4 by morphe because it's
just so much easier it's a rounded brush
from their elite collection and I'm
going to begin just to blend that
contour out all around the temples the
forehead area the cheekbones and as you
can see I'm not being very precise with
it at all because of the fact that we
are going to be cooking and bacon a
little bit more we can be a little
sloppy so now I'm going to go in with
the brush from morphe this is the m45 9
and this brush is incredible for this
method right here so I'm going to very
precisely carve out my contour and what
this is going to do is make our contour
bulletproof well you are not going to be
able to sweat through this it is going
to last all night it's going to sharpen
things up it's going to clean it out and
when we go in and we blend this away
it's actually going to look much softer
than you would expect as long as we do a
good job blending it won't look as harsh
as it does right now
this is a technique that we have stolen
from the drag world and I absolutely
love it we take everything from the
Queens I'm sorry about that you guys but
you have all the best tricks I'm going
to move on to my eyebrows now as always
using the Anastasia brow Wiz in the
shade taupe I'm going to go a little bit
thinner today like I mentioned in my
most recent video I'm not doing the
thick brows anymore I'm going to go a
little bit more on the thinner side and
I fill in where they really need and
then I really use that spoolie to blend
everything out and kind of spread that
brow is around to make it look a little
bit more natural but I still like them
to be defined and carved out so I do go
in with a definer brush and a little bit
of concealer just to make sure that they
are to my liking then I'm going to go in
with Mac my my Lana nylon eyeshadow and
I'm going to highlight the brow bone I
start in the very center right at the
high point and that's where I put the
most generous amount and then I will
blend down a little bit I like the most
generous amount of highlight right at
the high point of the brow to really
keep everything very lifted and defined
now I'm going to go in with a sigma
tapered highlighting brush whatever will
work and just blend all this out to
reveal our very
act faced and you can see that contour
is structured so make sure you blend all
that out so that it's not too harsh and
scaring people but it's okay your
contour scares me I'm totally fine with
it no judgement girlfriend I'm gonna
coat my lashes with mascara and then I'm
gonna be going in with Lily lashes in
the style Mykonos I've mentioned these
before they are my all-time favorite
lashes like they are so incredible but
they call for a very special occasion
because they are drama which is what I
love about them like these lashes with a
cat eye oh so fierce just like take me
now so beautiful moving on I am now
going to coat my inner waterline with
black liner I am using the ardency in
black liner because it is the blackest
creamiest eye Kohl you will ever use it
makes your job so easy blending this out
and then I'm going to take a little bit
of that black shade from the kat von d
palette and a flat definer brush and I'm
going to just blend back and forth to
really smoke out this lower lash line I
am going to cover a lot of this with
glitter but I want to initially go in
and smoke it out just so that everything
looks even so I don't want a super smoky
upper lid and then a totally dull lower
lid you know what I'm saying so I'm
going in with that muted Brown and a
pencil brush just to make it super duper
smoky then I'm going to take a little
bit more of that nylon highlight and put
a pop of it on that inner corner before
I go in with my glitter that way this
highlight is kind of beaming from
underneath of the glitter now I'm going
to go in with Urban Decay glitter and I
don't know what it's called I'm sorry
you guys I will link it down below in my
description bar I promise but I'm going
to start on the inner tear-duct of the
eye and then blend out I want the most
intense majority of the glitter to be
right in the inner tear-duct and then
we're going to kind of fade it like an
ombre effect to the other half of the
lower lash line then I'm going to put
just a thin coat of mascara on my lower
lashes this is the Rimmel lash
accelerator mascara and then we can move
on to blush I am using the Milani baked
blush in the shade Luminoso this is a
really nice kind of light pale peachy
shade I'm going to just dust that using
the morphe for all over the apples of
the cheeks and blend it backward and
then we're going to highlight using of
course a let's move campaign Papa still
hasn't gotten old people I'm still in
love with my baby I'm using the morphe
and 501 brush to highlight which is my
favorite brush for highlighting and I am
only going to put the highlight on the
top part
of my cheeks today and then kind of run
it down along the apples over the blush
because I want everything else to be
matte which is so different for me but I
want the eyes to pop with just a little
bit of highlight on the cheeks then I'm
going to use dose of colors lipstick in
the shade please and then I'm going to
go over that with the Marc Jacobs lip
gloss in the shade sugar sugar don't get
me started on these Marc Jacobs lip
glosses you guys I swear they're one of
my favorite formulas ever so beautiful
so worth the money anyways last but not
least you already know we are going to
take a shower and the Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray and that's that I
am out of breath I hope that you guys
enjoy thank you so much for watching I
love you and good night
