god
striving me crazy
so I recreated a look that I did on my
birthday for my birthday dinner um it is
technically a smokey eye I am using warm
and cool tone Browns
it's much different than anything I've
ever done here on YouTube before I don't
use cool tone Browns a lot on myself
just because it's not really my thing
but when I'm going on at night I do it
the way they look um I have all matte
colors in the crease today and on my
actual birthday I did do something a
little bit different I had a gold liner
in my inner corner um just to give an
extra pop and I had two lashes on each
eye it was very dramatic but really fun
so yeah um don't mind my eyes look kind
of funky in the video they're kind of
like red and yellow like I had an
allergic reaction to an eye product that
I use recently and it has not been fun
and it's been very painful but it is
getting better so I figured why not I'll
just make a video and just over comment
so please see past the eye issues oh my
gosh okay I'm leaving bye so I'm going
in with this Too Faced natural eye
palette and I'm going to take the color
nude beach and I'm wetting my brush you
can use fix+ or water it doesn't matter
I really suggest that you watch your
brush for this though because it's
really chunky and glittery and this will
help keep it there and not fall all over
your face plus it'll give it a really
pretty Sheen now I'm going to dab that
brush into all that glitters by Mac
which is just a neutral eyeshadow and
I'm gonna blend this overtop of what I
just did and I'm doing this just because
it look before could see right through
it and I want a more pigment now as
always I'm going to take soft brown on
that same brush I think I've done this
in every single tutorial so far and I'm
going to just dust it back and forth in
my crease generously I'm concentrating
more on the outer corner though because
I am going to have more darker colors
out there so I want to make sure I have
a good amount of soft brown out there to
help blend it up now I'm going to take
chopper and this is by Urban Decay sorry
it's like out of focus but this is a
really really beautiful like golden
brown color eye shadow and it does have
sparkles and glitter in it just like the
other color so I'm going to put this
right next to the first shade that we
had and my brush is still damp which is
a good thing because this like I said is
really glittery the glitter will fall
all over your
if you don't have something on your
brush that's damp to help keep it on
there
now I'm taking saddle and I'm going to
take it on a stiff blending brush and
I'm going to just dust it in my crease
and as always I'm starting off low with
my brush sideways and as you can see I
go really really slowly and then I kind
of dab and then I go really slowly and
dab um this is the most crucial part of
your makeup this is definitely the
easiest part to mess up I think but just
don't put that much - don't put too much
product on your brush and just go in
very slow motions and then also go back
with the same blending brushes before
with no new product on it and just go
over top of it over and over and that
will help blend out so that you don't
have too much color or any harsh lines
but as always when you start off just
start off low in your crease and just
gradually build your way up without
picking up any additional product
because that'll help so that you don't
have harsh lines because that's just not
cute and it never has been and it never
will be but you're just um keeping that
color in the outer corner but still
bringing it inwards a little bit to the
inner corner just to help blend it all
together but still you want the main
color to be out there
now I'm taking sex preso from that same
palette oh by the way I did my eyeliner
I want you guys to let me know if you
want me to show you do my eyeliner in
every video or if you don't mind me
skipping over that part because I feel
like I put in every single one and it's
so like boring plus I need to make an
eyeliner video soon but just let me know
so I'm using a synthetic brush which is
fluffier than the more dense white goat
hair I was using before to just get this
in there nice and lightly and then I'm
gonna go in with that same brush as
before which is stiffer and then pack it
even more I don't initially go in with
this brush because I don't want to go in
with tons of that really dark brown
product and just like make it look like
I have a bruise on the outer corner of
my eye to fluff it in there really nice
and smoothly and then go in with a
denser brush to just help give it no
lines now I'm just taking a moisturizer
or eye makeup remover whatever you
choose and I'm just cleaning up in my
under eye area because I do still have a
little bit of glitter under there that
fell out and so I'm swiping it away
and then I'm going back in with saddle
and I'm just dusting the outer part of
my eye where I use that sex spresso
shade and just gonna help blend this all
together because in the outer corner if
you don't want any harsh lines all about
the smoothness and as you can see I just
look around and I see what needs
touching up and I'm blending that dark
color and with the lighter color you get
it so yeah I'm doing my eyebrows now I'm
going to be doing a video on this soon
I've gotten a lot of requests from you
guys so I come I'm kind of skipping over
it quickly in this video but I use the
shade cork by Mac um a lot of you asked
and I always do have the products listed
down below in the description bar now
that I use my eyebrows look really light
here because I had some foundation over
top of them so it looks really dramatic
but it's actually my perfect shade now
I'm going in with select cover-up
concealer in nw20 and I'm just going to
blend it out with my finger to help give
it more of a natural look and this is
just a little bit lighter than my
foundation it's not too much lighter I'm
not doing like that Kardashian look
tonight but still it is a little bit
lighter it looks very natural though and
then after I have blended that in I'm
going to go in with Mac's mineralize
skinfinish in the shade light I'm just
going to dab any brush you want in there
I prefer a synthetic brush and not
natural and I'm just going to dust that
underneath my eyes to set that area this
is totally optional but my concealer
creases if I don't do it now I'm going
to take nylon I'm going to highlight the
inner corners of my eyes any brush will
do it doesn't matter but I'm going to
get it pretty generously in there
because pretty soon I'm going to go with
a darker color under there and I want it
to all kind of glow I'm also
highlighting underneath my brow and I'm
using a precision brush because I don't
like my highlight to be really sloppy I
like it to be right precisely underneath
my brow now I'm taking coastal reach
reach I don't know it's by Mac and it's
this reddish brown eyeliner and I'm
going to line my waterline with it this
is an interesting color um later on I
did go in with a black and kind of go
over top of it but it's a really pretty
like reddish brown it looks real
beautiful on brown eyes and light eyes
too but really beautiful and brown eyes
now I'm going to go in with saddle and
I'm going to rub this generously from
outer corner all the way to inner corner
um also you can go in with embark which
is a color by Mac or that's expresso
that we used up in that outer corner and
really smoked it out if you want to I
actually did that later and the night
but for right now this is really pretty
too so I'm just rubbing it back and
forth back and forth all the way to
inner corner all the way to outer corner
I'm not doing any light shade in my
inner corner tonight it's just this and
then I'm going to mascara my bottom
lashes as always this is something that
I don't skip because I feel like the eye
shadow particles get all over my
eyelashes and they look like they're
like light and blond it's kind of
weird-looking so yes this is an absolute
must must must for me if you have really
tiny eyelashes on the bottom you can
feel free to leave them out it won't
look weird now I'm taking NARS Laguna
bronzer this is my obsession recently
like I'm obsessed and I am just going to
bronze I'm not contouring too much just
bronzing I'm gonna put it all underneath
my cheekbones and on my temples and
forehead and you know the whole deal I'm
just gonna do everything I'm gonna go in
with a blush and kind of blend these two
shades together this is utterly game by
Mac it's a limited edition mineral and
it's just a peachy pinky blush there's a
lot out there that are just like it um
peaches by Mac is very similar to it I
just picked this one up and I'm just
putting on apples of my cheeks and I'm
blending it up into that bronzer I don't
want my blush to be too stand out and
then I'm gonna take soft and gentle by
Mac which it is not in focus sorry and
I'm just going to throw that on over top
of my blush and on the tops of my
cheekbones then I'm going to take
albatross by NARS and just dab dab dab
over it to give me more of a golden glow
because I wanted it to be gold and
silver now I am just taking the clear
brow gel and setting my brows with it so
that they're not flopping all over my
forehead this is an absolute must for me
and if you can see on the outer wing I
like tap it down so that my outer wing
doesn't move because it always does and
it does not look you I'm taking gel
holy lipstick by Mac and I am going to
put it all over my lips for a nice nude
but not too nude mouth and after that
you're done so I hope you enjoy have a
great day guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
