my current everyday makeup routine I was
like what am I gonna do this is gonna be
my current everyday makeup routine kind
of like my summer edition because this
is the look then I pretty much go to for
the summertime it's very bronzy it's
very glowy as you can see there's a lot
of like Browns I have like a peachy pink
lip on so this is just the look that I
go to let's say if I have to get up
really early in the morning I have to be
somewhere if I have to go to a meeting
if I have an appointment but I don't
want to go looking like a zombie this is
the look that I will do because it takes
me about 15 minutes when I'm off-camera
it's quick it's easy I don't do any
eyeliner I don't do any intense contour
it's a foolproof look I've got you never
mess it up no matter how tired I am so
that is what I mean by my everyday look
so this might be too much for some of
you it might be too much for everyday
look it might be too much highlight it
might be too much eyeshadow whatever
maybe we just remember it's just makeup
it washes off if you don't want to do
this look totally understand you can
modify it in this video I talk a lot
about like my favorite current products
I've been loving favorite brushes and
stuff like that it's very chill this
video is not a typical makeup tutorial
and I think that's because I usually
film right there but today I'm filming
on my actual vanity where I do my makeup
everyday and so I just felt like very
chill and just natural I'm gonna stop
rambling oh wait I completely forgot my
hair this is the first time that I've
been on camera with my new haircut
thanks you guys
i snapchatted you telling you I had to
get my hair cut because it was so dead I
was a girl to do and my Twitter
immediately got flooded the different
pictures of hair and thank you so much
to everybody who participated in the new
chocolate hill haircut because I was
screenshotting pictures that you guys
were tweeting me all night I was up in
bed until like 3 o'clock in the morning
like still screen shine picture so thank
you so much to everyone who sent me
photos so ok that's it I'm done rambling
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys and I'll see you soon
fight so the first thing I am going to
use on my skin
today is this makeup forever smoothing
is Elvis's yeah the smoothing primer can
take a little pinch of that on my
fingers and my hands my hands are clean
and I'm going to massage that in the
center of my face so I just rub that
wherever I want anything to be smoothed
over so next I'm going to go in with the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mist like I
mentioned in my last video this was only
purchased because of Kim Kardashian her
makeup artist uses this spray on her to
achieve that dewy luminous look and we
all know that Kim Kardashian always
looks like she's just glowing she's her
skin is always looking radiant and so
when I saw that this is what he was
using I was like mine this is a very
expensive product especially for a skin
miss but in my personal opinion it's
worth every penny and i 100% plan on
repurchasing it because I've never known
a product to give me such a dewy
luminous glow before if your oily you're
gonna absolutely hate this just being
honest but if you're dry and you can
never achieve a dewy luminous look like
that Victoria Secret model look this is
gonna your best friend and I'm just
gonna spray it pretty close to my skin I
don't like want to back here I want to
get it on my skin's I don't always this
I hope the camera can pick up how
luminous this is gonna make my skin like
when it dries in a few seconds like my
skin just looks like theme it's amazing
oh my gosh do you not see how like you
can see it looks luminous everywhere hey
so now it is time before foundation and
I'm going to be using the LT cosmetics
micro silk foundation I have been using
this now for like three weeks straight
it is my current favorite foundation I
do have some other favorites that I've
been loving recently too but this is the
like my non-stop everyday foundation
recently so this foundation is
definitely like a natural matte
foundation it's not a chalky matte but
it's definitely not do me which is why I
go in with a dewy spray before hand
because I want it to have a little bit
more of a dewy look because this
foundation is a little too matte on me
if I don't do something to make it
luminous I'm gonna go in with the morphe
m-43 9 brush this brush I am so in love
with you guys seriously it's like you
know how you look buy a new product and
you're like how did I ever live without
this what was i living like a caveman
honest to god don't know what it is
about this brush that makes it so great
but it's like it's dense I don't know
what it is but it's so amazing it's so
easy to apply foundation and it's so
easy to get the coverage that you desire
and it's like and it's round and it's
fat and it's big so it covers like a lot
of area in a short amount of time I
don't know I don't understand but this
is just my favorite foundation brush em
bar and I am an affiliate with more V so
if I'm ever talking about like a brush
or a product and you want to try it I do
have a discount code with them it's just
Jack Attack and all caps and that will
get you a discount code that will get
you to think oh that will get you a
discount on the morphe website for
anything on the site if you ever want to
try anything
i always forget to mention that discount
code I'm really bad about that I used to
be better back in the day when I first
like started you to about like finding
guys discount pose and talking about its
count codes but I'm sorry foundation
okay so now I'm going to conceal I don't
know if you noticed that my dark circles
are bad today they're usually not as bad
but I have been working a lot recently I
have not been getting the rest that I
need um I usually like allow myself like
a day every week to just do absolutely
nothing and roll up relax but this last
week has just been so insane I have not
been giving myself any rest I'm just
been pushing myself and pushing myself
especially since I'm going out of town
and I'm not going to be working for four
days and that stresses me out so I have
very bad dark circles right now because
I am NOT getting the rest that I need so
I am going to conceal bouton today and
then I'm going to take the opposite side
of the be blunder it's kind of damp in
areas where I always get crazy which is
in between my eyebrows and then right
here in my smile lines I guess I'm just
too happy and my face I get because my
foundation always creases here I'm going
to set my under eye area and I'm going
to use the Anastacio banana powder and
me Mac Pro and beside and I am just
going to set this entire under-eye area
I'm going to go over the side of my nose
and I'm going to bring it up towards the
temple I'm going to also put this on my
eyelid because that will help prime for
any eyeshadow that we're going to use
and I will
bring it back and so through their
motions I always start off with patting
motion and then I go in circular motions
when I first initially go in I don't
start wiping I go in and I Pat and this
will kind of help the skin to absorb the
powder first and then you kind of rub
around to get off any of the excess
product just slightly and put it on the
chin and then I'm also going to take a
little bit and put it on the upper lip
so now I'm going to go oh my god I
almost dropped that so I'm going to be
using the javelin hill favorites palette
my morphine it's still so weird to say
that um yeah if you guys don't own this
pallet don't feel like you have to like
use same shades as meet you guys because
it was limited edition and it's gone now
and I'm just gonna be using like some
basic everyday like brown shades you can
substitute for other things that you
have in your collection um I actually
just opened this this is a brand new
pallets my other one was getting way too
messy and I was like oh so I opened up
one of my backups I'm going to take this
shade right here first which is just
like a super nude neutral shade that I
just use in the entire like crease area
as a nice it's a nice transition and I'm
just going to take that all the way from
outer corner to inner corner and just
kind of rub it and everywhere what am i
using I can be bad about talking about
brushes and m5o to buy more feet I'm
going to grab this color up here next
right here next to the orange I'm just
going to pack that color all over the
entire lid and put it in the crease so
you can tell I'm not in any way trying
to like make this look gorgeous I'm just
kind of like throwing it on my eyes I
just love layering shadows as many as I
can when I'm doing my makeup so when I
have a palette like this that has like
tons of different shades of brown I love
layering them because it just gives such
a dimensional look to the eye and it
makes the blending process so easy and
everything just looks so smooth it's
actually less work for me to use more
shadows because if you use less shadows
you have to really focus on blending
that shadow output when you keep packing
them on it's like everything just comes
together so seamlessly most people are
like less is more and I'm like no more
is more I'm going to grab this orange
shade right here it's kind of similar
like a makeup geek
pity pick that put that here just for a
little bit more warmth I'm going to grab
this shade right here for my lower lash
line and I'm going to blend that out
with a pencil brush this is a morphe 18
this is from their Ely collection oh
very the collection is so amazing just
drag it along the lash line this one and
this one I'm going back and forth
layering shadows as always okay I'm
going to take this super dark round now
this is embark by Mac I just I don't
want to use the Jacqueline favorites
palette for the entire tutorial so I
know that not all of you have it and I
don't want to make you feel like oh why
not in that palette you know um but I
would just use this one right here if I
was going to continue this but I'm going
to use mapping bark instead so now with
Mac embark on a sigma e15 I'm going to
just put this on the lower lash line
okay so now going back with that same e
18 pencil brush I'm just going to blend
and bark out on my lower lash line okay
so I'm going to use a limited edition
pigment from Mac this has been gone for
like two years but I still have it on
the only reason I'm using this is
because I ran out of Mac nylon eyeshadow
and I had to repurchase it and it hasn't
gotten here in the mail yet so I'm using
this instead and it's basically the
exact same shade as Mac nylon so I'm
just using this instead in me to catch
my drift
so I was going to take that a tiny
little precision brush this is a Mac 228
I always use this for just inner corner
highlight and I am going to butt out
that highlight like you've never seen
better okay I'm going to fill in my
eyebrows I'm using a Nastasia brow is in
the shade taupe and I am pretty much
only going to fill in the spot that
needed I am NOT going to like carve them
out and sculpt them and all that jazz
because I want this to be a little bit
more chill than that and just deepen up
this outer tail and give the tails a
little bit more structure
then I'm going to take some mac
prolongwear rod over the water gram
waterproof brow set and I'm just going
to go over the entire brow with this
look how tiny this little wand is I love
that like it's so precise and this is in
a shade red chestnut so it matches my
hair a little bit and I'm just gonna go
over like the inner corner just slightly
and kind of drag it through it so I'm
going to curl my lashes sorry I'm
feeding my lash cool does it not look a
torturing device it really does fabulous
okay now I'm going to go in with mascara
this is the lights camera lashes mascara
by Tarte this is like my favorite
mascara I just think that it makes your
lashes so just voluminous voluptuous -
that's just so voluptuous creating like
a lemonade right now like a really
fruity drink oh well my Starbucks drink
apply mascara on my lower lashes now and
I'm gonna be using the Mac extended play
lash I think I change the name of this
this used to be called the gigablack
lash it was called the gigablack lash
when I work there what are you doing
that I don't get it
okay so now I'm going to bronze the fist
using the three five one
bronzer make it forever it's the one
that I've been using like crazy recently
it's like my favorite bronzer right now
I love it I'm going to be using the
morphe mb5 brush to apply this I've
raved about this brush before I was in
love with this brush when I first
discovered it and I'm just going to use
this to bronze my face so I'm just going
to start back here and add some warmth
to the skin thank God bronzer has to be
my favorite part of all of makeup like
when I apply bronzer I feel like yes I'm
coming to life there I am now for blush
I'm going to be using Mac margin which
is an oldie get to it and oldie but a
goodie it's right here and this is like
what
my favorite summer blushes I use this
every summer like crazy I probably gone
through three of these in my life which
is a lot because these blushes last
forever and I'm going to use a more feet
efore which is no joke you guys my
favorite blush brush that I've ever used
in my life it's not my current favorite
it is my favorite of all time I've never
used a blush brush that I like as much
as this one and I'm just going to apply
that on the apples and then bring it
back toward the temple you can see like
how pretty that color is it just has
such a beautiful glow in it
another blush that I love so much for
summer is Mac's some Basques so pretty
so now for the highlight I'm going to be
using champagne pop this is the
highlight that I created with Becca
cosmetics I'm so excited about this on
my hat I've talked about this so much on
Twitter and snapchat this is my first
time actually using on camera I don't
know if I'm technically supposed to be
talking about this yet but I will go in
depth in the next video and show you the
packaging in the actual color and all of
that but I'm just going to use it today
because it so excited it's what I've
been using for so long this is like he
only highlight pretty much that I had
been using for like the past three
months I'm not kidding
oh my god I'm so excited swatches on
camera for the first time I like have
goose bus that's using D am i shaking oh
my god i'm using the morphe m 501 brush
okay okay okay just goes to clean just
be strong to act like you can do this
the highlight is too strong it's too
honestly you guys have a kit
highlight is tool on fleek I gonna go
shoot a cat Red Alert was like my sleek
overload and then this is also something
that I will do with this highlight or
any highlight I'll take it like when I'm
wearing a shirt like this and I'll also
put it on my shoulders just to give like
up don't look at me I'm just a summary
and glowy what oh my god I can't help
myself but just glow from within if I
have like the most intense like Jabby
nasty collarbones ever and I'm like
always trying to hide them um but I will
actually highlight them to kind of give
that soft glowy appearance yes whoo oh
my god
it's like slightly amazing I've never
used this before what do I even using
right now this is by hot makeup and this
is kiss me more lip cream in the shade
blown away it's gonna dry matte though
which I I don't want it to dry matte
once it dries I'll probably put like a
clear gloss or something over except
kind of want to say glossy I don't want
it to be fully matte okay so now I'm
going to set everything using as always
the Urban Decay chill makeup setting
spray bathe myself mmm so good
so refreshing especially so hot in here
okay so even though my face is soaking
wet in Urban Decay chill settings right
talk about looking dewy
are you kidding me but I'm going to just
put a little bit of gloss over this lip
because I don't want it to be really
matte I want to have more of a glossy
look so I'm going to use buxom White
Russian I love this gloss so much all
right on the center of the lip just to
give a little class I already guys that
completes my current everyday makeup
routine I hope that you enjoyed this
video I know that for some people this
could be too much makeup this could be
too much highlight it could be too much
eye shadow whatever it may be but this
is my current everyday makeup routine
for the summertime it's so easy it
literally takes me 15 minutes to do this
look and it's just I just feel bronzy
and lord knows I feel glowy so I hope
that you guys enjoy this thank you so
much for watching this video
thank you for everything you guys

probably think but I love you very much
