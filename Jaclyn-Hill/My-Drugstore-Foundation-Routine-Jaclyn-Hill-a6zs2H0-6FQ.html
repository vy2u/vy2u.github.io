a foundation quick word about doing I'm
going to be doing a foundation concealer
and kind of contour routine using all
drugstore products I've been very highly
requested recently to do an updated
foundation routine I have I think two of
them from the past I'll leave them below
if you're curious but I wanted to do an
updated one and I realized I have never
done one using drugstore products before
and there are a few foundations from the
drugstore that I actually love so I
figured why not let's do it that doesn't
necessarily mean though that I'm going
to be using drugstore products on my
entire face it just means I'm going to
using drugstore products to achieve the
base of my face meaning my foundation
concealer in my contour um I'm on oh yes
I'm just gonna do like a heads up nails
are hot mess literally like to just
disappear in the middle of the night and
I'm getting them fixed very soon so no
judgement with the nails
I'm not going to ramble I'm going to get
started because I can't stand it when I
just like talked for 45 minutes in the
intro so the first thing I'm just going
to do is put my hair up just to get this
rat's nest out of my face so I did buy
the Maybelline fit me foundation off of
your guy's recommendations I bought this
yesterday morning and then I wore around
my house for a few hours yesterday and
so far I really liked it I liked the
color match I like the way it applied on
my face I like the way at war but I'm
not going to using this one in today's
video because I can't use something one
time and big I have to have like a few
weeks at least to try it
wear it multiple times and really get a
feel for it so with that being said I'm
going to using my tried-and-true today
and this is L'Oreal True Match Lumi if
you guys have been around my channel for
a long time then this will definitely
bring back some good old memories and be
very familiar to you because I have all
of this foundation for a long long time
I probably gone through like 5 or 6
bottles of this online kidding so this
is the loonie this is a healthy luminous
makeup one so this specific foundation
is going to be great for those of you
who are either dry or your normal skin
and you really want that luminous
glowy finish what I love about this is
it is there's no glitter or shimmer in
it it doesn't look cheap it just looks
very healthy just like you've been
eating your fruits and veggies and it
just makes your skin look healthy the
l'oreal original True Match that is not
the lumi this one is going to be much
better for those of you who are more
combination oily skin because it's more
of a matte to natural finish but for me
i'm dry in this time of year i'm like
drawn so i'm going to be using the lumi
these both have a sunscreen in it this
is an SPF 20 this is an SPF 17 i'm
expect don't like sunscreens my
foundation but for these they do not
bother me whatsoever my skin is really
sensitive so since we does n't always
work for me oh god like these so i am
going to be using a morphe eg6
foundation brush I just talked about
this in my favorites this brush love
this I'm going to just take by the way
I'm using shade w5 sand beige and this
is actually a little bit too pink for me
on my chest has more yellow in it than
this does but we make it work so I'm
just going to take a couple pumps of
this and put it on the back of my hand
and I will say that it's really
important when you're doing your
foundation you have cleanse and
moisturize your skin and you don't want
to wait too long after cleansing and
moisturizing to apply your foundation
like if you climb this and moisturize at
10 a.m. you don't want to wait until
4:00 in the afternoon to apply your
foundation I would say about 30 to 45
minutes after you cleanse your skin is
going to be like prime I'm going to just
take us off the back of my hand using
the morphe g6 I'm going to start right
here on the apples of my cheeks and then
blend outward I'm going to go in kind of
circular motions around the face to
blend this in and when I'm doing this I
do apply a lot of pressure that way I
can really push this into the skin and
it doesn't just sit and lay on top any
time I go over my lips with foundation I
look and feel like such a zombie okay oh
god like this
so you can see I have done the entire
lower half of my face from here down
with this brush just literally taking
one application off the back of my hand
like I've only gone once
in this entire area that's why I love
this brush because I feel like this
brush just takes such a small amount of
product and just really distributes it
all over the base like it doesn't steal
any of your product which is what I love
about it I'm just going to take what's
on the back of my hand and I'll wipe it
on my forehead so that we're not wasting
product and then just smooth that around
I'm going to make sure that I go up into
my hairline area because we don't want a
lot of demarcation that's not cute on
anybody
okay so that was two pumps of foundation
and my entire face is covered and I also
blended it down here on my neck and
jawline area and you also always want to
make sure that you connect the
foundation to the ears so that again you
can rely on demarcation because nobody
can pull off that look so yes this is
what the foundation looks like just by
itself it just looks very healthy and
very luminous and I I just love this
foundation it honestly does not feel
like a drugstore foundation to me and my
skin doesn't mind it's my skin is very
very sensitive and that's why I can't
wear a lot of drugstore products because
a lot of drugstore products are cheaper
because of the fact that they are using
ingredients that are not as high in
quality and my face is so sassy and gets
so annoyed with cheaper products and my
skin will break out I don't get like
hives and rashes so my skin does not
have an issue with L'Oreal True Match
thank goodness so now I'm going to go in
and conceal and I'm going to use the
Maybelline fit me concealer this is my
favorite concealer ever from the
drugstore colors of concealer and one is
light and one is deep my local CVS and
Walgreens never has like an in-between
color I know there has to be an
in-between color between these two and I
can never find them so what I do is I
mix them together so I will take the
light one and just do like like that and
then I will take the deep one and just
blend it in with that and then I'll just
mix it all together as I go I'm going to
take a damp beauty blender to blend this
out a Beauty Blender has been my best
buy recently when it comes to applying
concealer I just love it for so many
reasons a damp Beauty Blender I feel
like it makes
impossible to overdo your concealer
because of the fact that it's damp it
will soak up any excess product that you
are applying so if you are heavy-handed
like a lot of us content to be then a
damp Beauty Blender will be great for
you because it really makes sure that
you don't pack on too much always make
sure that I get in that inner corner and
I blend it and with the nose because the
foundation to be applied we use this
brush and just kind of like swept it
right here so there is going to be a
line right there foundation so I always
make sure I take my concealer and I down
here also you want to make sure that
whenever you are applying concealer that
you dab and do not or rub because that
will just take that product or right off
your face so until it's dry
just dab and again when you set that
concealer you want to go from the outer
corner of the eye to the inner corner of
the eye because that will help prevent
creasing as opposed to going this way
which is what we naturally want to do
you can do that but then when you get to
the end and you're finishing it up use
one of those new outer core in a couple
of times and that will help that
concealer not crease it's kind of like
when you're blow-drying your bangs and
you want to get big volume and your
bangs and have them stay and you want
them to lay this way the trick is to
pull it the opposite way and blow-dry
them that way for a few seconds and then
when you put them back over they lay
perfectly it's the same concept with
cause of a concealer with concealer if
you dab the opposite way of you're used
to doing it will help set it and not
crease okay so now for my favorite part
I'm going to take L'Oreal True Match a
liquid foundation this is in the shade
n7 and I'm going to use this to kind of
contour slash bronze of my skin which i
absolutely love this technique because I
just think that it looks so pretty and
so natural and it's just so easy to
accomplish so I'm just going to be
taking this straight out of the bottle
and I'm going to be using a makeup geek
cheap highlighter brush this is like my
favorite brush ever to blend out cream
products on my cheeks I love this I will
link it down below of course so what I'm
going to do you can dump this on the
back of your hand you can dump it out on
anything you want but I'm going to take
it straight like this and just dab this
brush right in that area on top of this
bottle so I'm going to take this brush
and I'm just going to contour with this
like I typically would starting from
the back part of my cheek you want to go
from the top of the ear to the corner of
the mouth is where your guidelines
should be but I recommend not bringing
it all the way down because I'm
definitely start to give you that really
intense I sculpt the cheek so I'm just
going to go from the top of the ear or
right like this and then start blending
it I'm going to wipe a little bit off I
have a paper towel right here and then
I'm just going to blend that upward and
circular motions the entire time we're
going to go in circular motions I do not
recommend any swipe beam like this
unless you're going circular because
again that will just kind of take off
the product and again I'm just going
like this and just taking it straight
from the bottle you can do it however
you please but this is quick and easy so
again it's going to start from the tip
of the ear and bring it down towards the
corner of my mouth but I only bring it
about to the outer corner of my eye and
then that's where I stop and I start
blending upward never want to blend
downward because that would defeat the
purpose of contouring and that looks
kind of make your face look very round
so I'm going to blend this upward all
the way towards the temple down on the
Apple cheek and then we will move on to
the forehead area so I'm going to take
this and put it right along the hairline
because this will just even everything
out I mentioned many times that when you
bronze or highlight whatever is you're
adding to the face you want to make it
look most natural you really need to
make sure that you put it in more place
in just one so if you're going to
highlight underneath your eyes you want
to also highlight in other areas like
the chin the bridge of the nose the
forehead above the brow because it will
just kind of evenly distribute it across
space you want to do the exact same
thing with bronzer so if you're going to
do the cheek area you want to also do it
the temples and the hairline and the
forehead area as well just to kind of
blend it all out and it'll look much
more natural go back with this original
foundation brush I have no extra
foundation on it I'm going to go back in
this area and kind of blend all this out
to make sure that we don't have any
harsh lines because I don't want that
bronzer to be too intense on the
cheekbones or the center of the forehead
so it's going to go back and make sure
so this is the finished foundation look
right here as you guys can see what I
love about this look is that we use
cream products to achieve it and it's so
so simple and in the summertime it's
very easy for most people to keep like
that healthy glowing you know pretty
skin it's not overly dry because we have
high humidity and it's very hot but in
the winter months with the cold weather
especially for those of you who are in
very cold climates we lose our humidity
we get super super dry and it's very
hard for our skin to look naturally
healthy and glowing doing a look like
this as your base where you're using all
cream products especially to contour
your face is going to keep that luminous
healthy glow all throughout the winter
months of course very important to
moisturize and exfoliate and use like
hydrating masks along the way as well
but this makeup look is a really go-to
makeup look for me throughout these cold
months because I just think that it
keeps you looking very bronzed and
healthy all winter long so yeah I'm just
going to go in and finish off my face by
just doing a few more things I'll be
right back
alright so that completes this look
honestly I have Georgie right here on my
lap could see his little top not you
anyways
so yeah I just went in and did like some
basic steps just to finish off this look
I honestly thought the idea of wearing a
full face of makeup today was just like
so exhausting so I kind of stuck with
that whole fresh face natural ask vibe
we had going and just did some basic
steps to complete this look if you guys
are interested in what I apply it off
camera or what I use on camera what I'm
wearing all that jazz I will link
everything in the description dot the
description box down below I'm also
going to randomly link a sweater for you
guys down there because this sweater
that I have right here is literally like
my new obsession it's from Nordstrom
it's Topshop and I know this is so
random but I feel like everyone's always
looking for a good comfortable sweater
and this one is just I live in it I've
only had it for a week and I've worn it
every single day I wake up when I put it
on I get out a shower and I put it on
like I'm obsessed with the sweater you
only get for you guys just because I
always think it's nice to find a good
sweater anyways so I'm gonna stop
talking I hope that you guys enjoy this
video I honestly love this technique of
bronzing and contouring with just a
darker a liquid creamy foundation it's
just so ideal for the colder
or months so yeah I hope that you guys
enjoy thank you so much for watching I
love you and I'll see you soon
