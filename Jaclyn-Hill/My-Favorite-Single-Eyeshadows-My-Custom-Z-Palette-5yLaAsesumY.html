to be doing I don't even know I'm
calling this I have been thinking about
what to call this for so long I've been
thinking about what to call this video
for weeks and I'm kidding and then last
night I was thinking about as I was
falling asleep I woke up thinking about
I would love to call it like my my go-to
palette or like I can't live without
palette but then that sounds like a
palette that you purchase at Sephora and
that's not what this video is about so
what this video is about is this palette
right here this is a Z palette that I
customized with my favorite individual
eyeshadows so the normal sized Z palette
is like way smaller than this it's like
literally like this big right here um
but this one's like the mega Daddy Z
palette I don't know what it's called
it's called the pro palette the mega
palette I'm not really sure I will find
it somewhere on a website I'll link it
down below for you guys that we have a
reference to the size of this this
palette lives with me at home it's the
only eyeshadows I keep with me at my
home on a day to day basis when I travel
and I go out of town this is the only
palette I bring with me when I go out of
town so basically I have created like my
dream everyday go-to can't live without
palette with my single individual
shadows I had my collection so every
single shower that you see in here is
either by mac makeup geek or Anastasia
of Beverly Hills I snapped about this
about a month and a half ago or so I'm
not really sure and I've gotten requests
for a video going into detail a product
breakdown of every single shadow this
palette pretty much every single day
sense so that's what I'm going to be
doing for you guys today is basically
just talking about my favorite can't
live without shadows I have everything
in here from my highlights I have three
different highlights for three different
moods that I'm in I have all my
transition colors I have my warm
transitions my cool transitions my
purpley transitions I've got my warm
Browns I've got everything I've got my
pops of color my corals my reds my
greens everything that I could need to
create a look I've got right here and I
love having this with me at my house now
especially just one pallet like this
because most of the time like in my life
I've always had like my neutral palette
my purple palette my green palette like
I have them so organized that I tend to
always grab my neutral palette and only
do my eyes neutral now that I see all of
these laid out all the time it
encourages me to be like let's use this
one today let's use this on the lower
lash line
encourages me to step outside of just my
everyday neutrals and add some fun pops
of color to my everyday look which I
have been doing a lot recently so I'm
going to go ahead and jump into the
video I'm going to go one by one I'm
going to show you what shadow is which
in the order that they're in from what
brand I will also give you a swatch of
every single color so you can see what
my favorite go to individual eyeshadows
are so let's get started first shadow of
course is my favorite highlight ever for
the brow bone and the inner eyes this is
nylon by Mac it's super duper frosty the
tiniest bit that goes such a long way
it's also absolutely gorgeous as a
highlight on the top of the cheekbone it
also has kind of a yellow undertone so
it really makes it beam off the skin
next highlight we have a mirage by
makeup geek and this is actually close
to a mat with just a little bit of a
sheen in it I personally love this one
if you want really natural-looking
highlight or if I ever like take my ash
eyeshadow too high and I don't have time
to like wipe the off and redo it I'll
almost use this as an eraser because
it's just so natural it'll kind of use
it to buff away my shadow and I love it
next we have Rapunzel this is beautiful
it's like not a full shimmer not a full
matte it has the perfect amount of Sheen
in it if you are looking for a really
beautiful brow bone highlight and you
don't want it to be ultra frosty like
nylon and you don't want it to be really
mad I would really suggest this one it's
a nice neutral color and it just looks
gorgeous on so many skin tones next we
have peach smoothie which basically does
even need an introduction this is one of
my favorite transition colors of all
time it's just so natural with a little
bit of a peach undertone in it which is
why I love it because I think that peach
really awakens and like makes the eyes
look very bright and feminine so Peach
Smoothie again by makeup geek we have
creme brulee this is just a really
really beautiful kind of natural shade I
mix this and Peach Smoothie all the time
together that is my go-to transition
color on days where I want to really
emphasize the eyes and look more awake
but at the same time I don't want to go
smoky creme brulee is super neutral and
just really really easy to apply next I
have soft Brown by Mac which is similar
to creme brulee and this says they can
both be used the same way but soft Brown
has more of a pink undertone in it so I
love soft Brown when I am doing anything
that ink
a purple or a pink look like if I want
my eyes look more mommy I will go with
soft brown by Mac as opposed to creme
brulée by makeup geek next we have
frappe
this is frappe right yet Friday this is
a really nice medium toned kind of
brownish red now when you first look at
it you're holding it individually you're
not going to think that it has any red
undertones in it but when you hold it
next to other Browns you will see that
there is definitely a reddish pinky
undertone which makes it really
different than the rest of them now I
have Mac kid I don't know if this is
actually available anymore I heard a
rumor that they got rid of it which
would be really really sad because this
is such a great transition color for
someone who is really fair or if you're
trying to do a more cool tone neutral
eye look Mac kid is just a great great
transition color to start with it's very
pale it's got a little bit of a gray
undertone in it it's just beautiful now
we have Barcelona Beach this is by
makeup geek and this has a lot of gray
tones in it so this shadow I have used
in several tutorials and I always go in
with it when I want my shadow to be a
little bit more cool so if I'm going in
with purples if I'm going in with grays
if I'm going to do like a silver and
black smoky eye Barcelona Beach is a
great color to use in the transition
color in the crease because it is cool
but it's not so cool that is going to
make your eyes look Bruce it has it a
little bit of a grey topi undertone so
to help hold that look together next we
have faun and this is by Anasazi of
Beverly Hills just like the other ones
it's a great transition color for the
crease it's very neutral it's just
basically brown I'm saying like it is a
great neutral Brown there's no hints of
pink peaches it's just a great neutral
transition color turned Rochon color I
can't say transition color transition
color for the crease now we have Mac
saddle this is one of my favorite this
was my original love Mac saddle and red
brick those were like my favorite babies
ever like I've been using saddle
literally since I was fifteen years old
this is one my first like Mac shadows of
all time I've gone through probably 15
of these things it is one of my favorite
colors just to put in my crease like
I'll do creme brulee and Beach smoothie
and my trend Beach smoothie peach
smoothie and my transition color and
then I'll put this lower in my crease I
just love it it's at a nice bronze warm
round it's just beautiful and this is a
Matt shadow I absolutely love Mac saddle
now we have desert sands by makeup geek
in this is one of my favorite colors I
mean I'm gonna say that about everything
in this palette because like my
favorites but oh my gosh this is kind of
the color of baby puke and I've
mentioned that for years on my channel I
know it sounds so disgusting but it's
one of my favorite colors it's like that
mustardy yellow kind of baby vomit it's
just so beautiful I love it so much and
that again is by makeup geek another one
of my all-time favorites I love the
shadow this is makeup geek chickadee
such a cute name and this is just a
really really great peachy orange shade
but it's like a creamsicle color it's
not too orange it's not like Mac rule
it's not in your face I love using this
when I have a tan like in the summer as
my transition color I'll take just this
and some peach smoothie and go lightly
and dust it in my crease I just think
that it really emphasizes the tan but
since it's matte it still looks natural
and just gives your eye a glow it's
really really beautiful
a lot of people are intimidated by
shades like that but don't be like
they're so flattering now we have Mac
amber lights this is one of my original
favorites again by Mac when my first
eyeshadows I ever owned by Mac I've been
through so many of these it's such a
gorgeous gorgeous gold but it's not just
like a normal gold it's like a rusty
gold almost like a burnt gold maybe it's
such a good color Mac Swiss chocolate
the one thing I will say is I wish that
max was chocolate had more pigment
I've been writer die for this eyeshadow
for years and years and years but I
always feel like I have to dig my brush
so hard in a Mac Swiss chocolate to get
the color payoff that I really really
want but this is kind of a deep purpley
Brown is so flippin gorgeous now we're
going to start moving into like the Reds
and copper now we have matte red brick
shade is so effing good like I can't
such as a matte kind of pale ish red
orangie shade it's not like red like a
strawberry you know but it's just
perfect it's perfection then I have
makeup geek poppy I love this shade
because of the fact that it isn't like
an orange it isn't a red
but in the name of it is perfect it's
got like a sky like almost like a pinky
coral undertone along with orange and it
just comes together so perfectly I love
the shade my favorite way to use this
shade is like right now I would grab
like a transition brush on buffing brush
I would just tap it like right here in
the crease area and it will really just
bright in that area up and make it like
give it a pop papi oh my god this is
Anastasia of Beverly Hills henna this
color is so freakin bomb I love this
shade so this is definitely a statement
shade it is like a firecracker
very copper very red very rusty very
pigmented now we have Mac copper ring
this is one of my favorite eyeshadows of
all time I think I can see copper ring
from a mile away
like if someone within a 1 mile radius
is wearing this I'm like there's a girl
six houses down left hand side or more
on coral straight-shooter in copper ring
this is just one of my favorite
eyeshadows ever it's just such a
beautiful shimmery copper shade
obviously cocoa bear has the biggest hit
of pan out of all of them because cocoa
bear is one of my ride or dies it's just
such a gorgeous all matte burnt red
brown absolutely gorgeous can't live
without cocoa bear this is a Nastasia
fudge I recently mentioned how much I
love this color and one of my um
favorite videos I remember one month it
was but that's irrelevant absolutely
gorgeous it is such a dark pigmented
fudgy Brown I love it it is so easy to
use with so many different eye looks
it's just a perfect brown like it's just
perfect honestly it's like my favorite
Brown right now honest to god it's like
very neutral not too purple not too grey
not too warm not too cool it's mom it's
such now we have makeup geek grandstand
grandstand is so beautiful I love using
grandstand for a smoky eye and doing
like warm Browns in the crease and super
dark Browns like blacks in the outer
corner it's just absolutely gorgeous
it's kind of like got a pinky champagne
E undertone it's just beautiful not too
light not too dark just beautiful now we
have vintage by makeup geek this is a
matte kind of medium tone cool purple
this color is what I use if I'm doing
like a really purple eye and I need to
blend out a purple shade you never know
what shade to grab I will grab
vintage the only thing is you want to
keep it low because if you take vintage
up too high it will start to look a
bruise you want to use a more warm to
neutral shade in the crease because
that'll keep you from looking like
you've been punched basically now we
have cherry cola again by makeup geek
such a gorgeous shade it's got like a
purpley cherry undertone so gorgeous I
don't know if I would call this a purple
or like a purple meets brownish I don't
know but this color is so good I reach
for it constantly I love this shade this
is aubergine by anastasiya I mention
this in a video as well it's got a sheen
to it it's not a full matte if not a
full shimmer it's got the perfect amount
of Sheen I will wear this in my outer
corner I'll wear this underneath on my
like on my lower lash line because it's
not too shimmery but it's also not matte
it's just such a good purple color I
love it I do even realize that one of
these Browns right here is something
that I actually can't talk about yet
because it's something that I'm working
on but you'll see it later next we have
bitten by makeup geek I love this color
I'd say about every single thing that I
picked up but I just love everything in
here and this is such a beautiful shade
I went through a really really hardcore
phase where I was using bitten like
literally every single day for probably
a year people were like stop using
bitten already it's just a really
awesome kind of warm purple eye shadow I
love it so last Brown and the palette is
americano by makeup geek this is more of
a medium to dark kind of cooler tone
matte Brown this is definitely isn't
warm and it's not fully neutral either
there's definitely some grey kind of
taupey notes in there so if I ever want
to reach for something that's not so
warm like everything else that's what
I'll grab we've got make a geek cupcake
this is a really beautiful soft pink not
too pink because I can be afraid to use
Pink's on my eyes even though I love
reds coppers corals Pink's scare me
because I can easily look sick but this
color is a pink that I can wear and I
absolutely love there's a big dent in
this one right here because I use it a
lot especially in the summer time
because I think it looks just really
beautiful when I'm personally just a
little bit more bronzed when I'm really
fair I can't do those shadow
they just make me look like Jeff are you
feeling okay I'm like yes I'm fine I see
a wash off my eye makeup now we have a
Nastasia macaroon macaron macaroon I'll
just say macaroon this is a really
gorgeous lilac purple color it's got a
very intense shimmer to it it's super
different I think it's gorgeous I've
only used this one time but I have it in
my palette because I'm like I want to
start picking this up more often so it's
there as an encouragement to myself I
love this color this is Houdini by
makeup geek I've done a tutorial I've
done a tutorial using Houdini it's such
a gorgeous kind of I'm gonna know it's
like a turquoise blue emerald deep sea
kind of I don't know I don't know how to
describe this it's just gorgeous such a
cool fun color
this is dragonfly by makeup geek and
I've only use this once but I love it so
much because it's just so different I
will be using this in the spring in the
summer for sure like this is a color
that you can just pop on the lower lash
line or you can just like make a pop of
color and just like smoke this out on
the outer corner and put on some lashes
and it's just so fun and so different of
the vibrancy and I love that it's matte
I feel like we don't have that many
matte pops of color I love this so fun
and so different that's another color
that's in there just to encourage me
like come on Jacqueline where me where
me this is makeup geek gesture which is
a foiled eyeshadow and it is very olive
green with golden undertones so gorgeous
I've worn this several times and I just
think it's so beautiful especially if
you have brown eyes jester is just like
Oh beautiful I feel like jester I feel
like all of greens in general aren't as
popular as I wish they works I love
olive green
speaking of olive green dirty martini by
makeup geek matte olive green this color
is everything oh my god I love this you
can take this and just put it all over
your entire lid blend it out with like a
warm brown and put on some lashes and oh
my god you've got the most beautiful
smokey eye in seconds this is just such
a good color and then the last color in
Z palette is enchanted forest
and again this
by makeup geek and this is an all match
kind of forest green all that makes
sense why they called enchanted forest
uh um super super beautiful I love the
way this looks with dirty martini which
of course is matte as well they just
really complement each other
gorgeous I can just hold this color up
like to my face and just stare at it
like you are so pretty
