my go-to daytime glam makeup look that
is a mouthful I have gotten a lot of
requests recently for a daytime makeup
look and then when I uploaded my October
favorites video I had a ton of requests
to do a makeup tutorial on the look that
I was wearing in that video and I was
like okay like it's such a simple makeup
look but it's my go-to makeup look for
days where I maybe have like a meeting
or I'm like running errands but I have
some time to get ready before I take off
in the morning or whatever it may be if
it's anything it's daytime and I want to
look fresh and alive and awake and girly
and feminine and still glamorous but not
over-the-top and not like a smoky cat
eye and a structured contour like a bold
red lip you know I'm saying it's very
daytime appropriate while keeping it
feminine yet still glam so yeah I don't
that you guys enjoy my personal go-to
makeup look keep in mind the eyeshadows
I use in this video they're constantly
changing so I might use this palette
today and always a different palette
tomorrow but overall I like to always
use neutral matte shades on my upper lid
and then keep my lower lashline very
light light shadows under there nothing
dark nothing harsh to way the eyes down
and that is how I go about my daytime
glam looks also I always use false
lashes just because I've gotten to the
point where it's so easy for me to use
false lashes it's actually easier for me
to pop on lashes than it is for me to
use mascara curl my lashes and make my
natural lashes look good so that's the
personal thing for those of you who are
not comfortable with false lashes or you
struggle with them just forget it
just do your regular lashes it will look
just as beautiful this is just my
personal preference and my personal
go-to makeup look so yeah that's it I
hope you guys enjoy this video
I just really quickly want to say that
holiday looks are on the way but I'm not
gonna lie or fake it I am so not feeling
festive this year at all I'm so not
inspired when it comes to holiday makeup
looks last year I was so ready for
Christmas and Thanksgiving and so ready
for the holidays
I feel like I'm still in August I don't
feel like we're in November and it's
about to be Thanksgiving like I'm just
not in it at all so please leave your
comments down below or tweet me photos
of inspiration and help me get inspired
you can inspire me and then I can
inspire you in return and we can make
this a group effort so I can get out
some Bob holiday looks for you guys that
you would actually like to see so please
leave your comments down below for
whatever it is because I'm just not
feeling it right now but I know that if
I get you guys involved I know that I'll
start feeling inspired and I'll dig okay
I'm ready for the holidays so give me
what you got you guys I really
appreciate it and yeah that's it enjoy
the video I love you guys thanks for
watching and I'll see you soon bye hello
my darlings
we're gonna be starting with our face
our skin today so I'm gonna go in with
the Marc Jacobs invisible undercover
perfecting coconut face primer Oh holy
guacamole that is a mouthful and I'm
going to be using my clean hands to
massage this all over my entire face
area then I'm going to go in Foundation
and I'm currently mixing the co Gendo
aqua foundation and the Mac mineralized
moisture SPF 15 foundation I love them
both separately but I love them even
more together so that's what I do I
combine them to get the best of both
worlds I mix them on the back of my hand
make a little foundation cocktail and
then I dot whatever is on my finger all
over the balm my face and then I go in
and buff everything out recently I have
just been loving this Tarte kabuki
foundation brush you guys like it's just
so big it covers a wide range on the
face so quickly and it makes everything
look very sheer so if you like a lot of
full coverage I would not recommend this
brush but this kind of sheers out my
foundation which I like because I can
actually be heavy-handed and it's kind
of stopped me from doing that and that's
why I love it so much now I'm going to
go dampen my little Real Techniques
sponge which is basically the same thing
as the Beauty Blender but it's the Real
Techniques version and I absolutely love
it so much better and of course my dogs
have to follow me everywhere I go if
they hear a door open in the house they
come running it's like they have to be
involved in every little movement that I
make so now I'm going to go in and
conceal the under-eye area and I'm using
the Urban Decay weightless naked
concealer which is honest to god my
favorite concealer of all time I am now
out of my second tube which is just
crazy I'm so hardcore committed to this
and then I am blending out with the damp
Real Techniques Beauty sponge and then
once we've done that I'm going to make
sure that I set the entire under-eye
area and I'm going to be you youqing I'm
going to be using the Mac Pro emphasize
shaping powder just a very small amount
of it and I am using a morphe brush this
is the M for 3/8 brush Sigma has one
that's extremely similar but i am using
the morphe one today and I'm just going
to set that really lightly my eye area
underneath the eye area and then also on
the forehead and the chin because I just
don't want to be shiny and if you guys
are interested in why I'm doing all
these steps you can watch my foundation
routine I just uploaded it two weeks ago
I will link it down below if you're
curious now I'm going to be going in
with the becca hombre rouge eye palette
i just discovered this palette maybe two
weeks ago and i've been absolutely in
love so i'm going to start with the
second to lightest color and i'm
literally going to go down the line and
go with that one and then the next
darker color the next darker color and
so on and so on forth until we get to
the very end of the palette so I'm
initially going in with that one on a
morphe brush but then I changed my mind
and I grabbed my Sigma e-40 because I
wanted something fluffier so I grabbed
that one instead so I'm going in with
the second darkest shade and I'm just
going to put this on the outer corner of
the eye and I'm not really meaning to
put on the lid or in the inner corner
but once I have a little bit of a less
product on my brush I will kind of
slightly dust it onto the lid and on the
inner corner of the eye ish but again we
want to keep this predominantly on the
outer corner now I'm going to go in with
that warm Brown which is such a
beautiful color and I love this color
mixed with these kind of like purpley
cranberry shades it's really really
beautiful and I'm going to dust that
again in the outer corner and just
really make sure that I am using this
color to blend everything out so there's
no harsh lines and then we're going to
go in with a super dark chocolatey color
which I absolutely love and I'm going to
be using the M 4-3-3 brush by morphe to
pack this on the outer V and then blend
it out again I'm really focusing on the
outer corner and then once we don't have
much products left on the brush that's
when I will kind of go on the lid area
and kind of up into the higher crease
area and blend it outward but I want
this to be mainly
in the outer corner of the eye for
definition and dimension so that we have
that smokiness on the outer corner and
not all over the place now I'm going to
take a little bit more of that Mac Pro
emphasize I love the shaping powder so
much I use it every single day I can't
load up this product it's so necessary
for me and using a Mac 242 brush I'm
going to pack this on the entire under
eye area on the inner corner and I'm
also going to bring it around and kind
of sandwich the entire inner corner of
my eye in this product you can kind of
bring it up on the bridge of the nose as
well I mean you can you can put this all
over the place you guys it is such a
beautiful natural looking highlight
because it's not shimmery and it's not
matte it's like a luster it's just so
gorgeous so I'm really packing on that
entire inner corner because this is
what's going to make you have that
really like wide oh I'd fresh-faced
effect then I'm going to go in with any
nude eye pencil this is the Mac Pro one
in the shade NC 15 slash nw20 which is
basically to the color of concealer and
I'm going to line my waterline with that
too even more so brighten up the eye
area and make my eyes really pop and
look very awake and fresh then I'm going
to fill in my brows and I'm using the
Anastasia brow Wiz in the shade
chocolate I recently transitioned from
using taupe to chocolate because I
thought I needed a little bit of a
darker color and a little bit warmer of
a shade because I was using a really
ashy taupe color and I need a little bit
warm of a shade and I'm going to just
again using the Mac 242
put a little bit of Mac nylon on the
brow area as my highlight because it's
my favorite highlight ever and then I'm
gonna pop on some lashes and it's
driving me crazy because I do not know
the name of the southies lashes thereby
flutter but it did not say the name
anywhere on the Box I got online I can't
figure out but they're just basic wispy
lashes so any sort of like the demi
wispies or like velour wispy sweet
nothings anything that are just nice and
wispy and very daytime I just pop those
on and then that was it and I'm gonna
coat my lower lashes with some mascara
because even though I wanted it to be
super bright I didn't want to be like
totally dead I wanted some life down
there so I just coat my lashes with one
coat of mascara to do the under eye area
and now I'm going to go in with the
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
dust that all over my face because this
will just help my bronzer and my blue
I should go on way more effortlessly and
make it much easier to blend and just
look much smoother overall then I'm
gonna go in with bronzer and I'm going
to be using the makeup forever bronzer
in the shade what is this three five one
and I am using the morphe M 5 2 3 brush
to apply this which I have been loving
the past month I started using this
while I was in California or maybe like
a little bit before I left and I just
absolutely love this brush for applying
bronzer it's been my go-to recently so I
am slightly contouring but I'm not going
to make it structured I'm not going to
bake myself I'm not going to chisel
myself out I'm just putting it on the
cheekbones and on the forehead and then
moving on I'm setting my brows with a
Nastasia clear brow gel because oh my
god they can get a little cray cray and
it's not cute so I always have to set my
brows with clear brow gel and then for
blush I'm going to be using NYX
bittersweet it's a really pretty kind of
Mabi color beautiful for the Fall
because it's not too pink it's not coral
and it's not too bronze it's just a
really really great kind of
natural-looking Mabi shade so I applied
that to the apples of the cheeks and
then I will go in and mix champagne pop
and pearl and the champagne glow palette
with the m-53 one brush as a highlight
because I don't care what the occasion
is or what time of day it is I am going
to be highlighting my cheekbones no
matter what you just can't stop me it's
something that I will do no matter what
my routine is I will never skip this
part and then I'm going to go in with
Mac mineralize the glass in the shade
modest I didn't want to do lipstick or
lip liner I wanted to keep it just nice
and glossy and feminine so yeah that
completes my go-to daytime glam look I
hope you guys enjoy the look in the
video I love you and I'll see you soon
I want to take a quick moment to talk
about something that I'm actually so
nervous even bring up because it's such
a sensitive subject and I'm so terrified
of ever like saying the wrong thing and
hurting somebody in any way um but I
mean it keeps me awake at night and I
just really want to talk about it for a
minute and just say how sorry I am for
what happened in Paris and it directly
affecting anyone who is watching this
video right now I just want to say that
I am so sorry that you've had to go
through this and no one deserves this
and I love you and my thoughts and my
prayers are with you and I know there's
so much evil in the world and I can't
put a stop to that the only thing I can
do is try to continue to be positive and
be loving and remind you guys even
though there's so many horrible things
in the world and so many terrible people
there are still good ones and for those
of you who are going through anything
having to do with this Paris attack or
any of the other countries that are
going through horrible things right now
if you're watching this video and you're
living in fear and you're scared to walk
outside your front door I just want you
to know that there are people there are
people like me and John who are staying
awake at night praying for you doing
what we can and I just I'm very sorry I
got a tweet from God I got a tweet from
a young girl the day after what happened
in Paris because I tweeted about it and
someone respond to me and to me you know
thanks for thanks for caring Jacqueline
you know I live in Paris and I'm
actually right down the street from the
theater where you know one of the events
took place and she told me how her and
her family are so terrified that you
know they hadn't left the house and she
doesn't know when they're going to leave
and I was just like such a wreck reading
this sweet and that's just one of
millions of stories of people that are
affected by these horrible acts all
around the world right now and I know
this is just a beauty channel and I
really my input might not mean that much
but I just want to spread love and
positivity to you guys and just let you
know that there are good people out
there who are rooting for you and want
only the best for everyone and I'm just
so sorry to anyone who was affected by
this who has lost a family member who is
going through anything do these events I
just want to say I love you very much
and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
