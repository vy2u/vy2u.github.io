so I can only say that it feels right
right
say that it feels right
hey guys so for today's video I'm going
to be doing a makeup tutorial on this
look right here obviously I always say
the same thing in every single video I'm
rushing because my husband is down the
car waiting for me right now I actually
left with him to go home he's I film it
like my beauty space and in the car I
was like oh I forgot mine intro like
turn the car around and rush back here
so I'm filming really quickly and we're
both so hungry I need to go get dinner
and he's waiting for me down in the car
alright I'll be right there but anyways
this is my go-to makeup look for nights
when I'm going out or even if it's a
daytime I don't whenever I feel like
having a really smouldering kind of
fierce like sexy eye makeup look this
has been my go-to look for months now
and I've seen a ton of requests for you
guys see me wearing this look on
snapchat
quite often sometimes I'll change it up
and I'll do like all matte colors and
I'll leave out the shimmer that I have
on the lid and I'll just do like the
outer crease but for the most parts I
always do this with neutrals and browns
and warmer colors I really love it I
think it brings a lot of attention a lot
of attention to the eyes and it
definitely gives you that more like
slanted eye look because of that cat eye
that we are doing so yeah I hope that
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching I love you I'll see
you soon bye first things first I'm
going to be priming my eyes and the way
I like to do this everyone has their own
way of priming their eyes you can just
going with a girl I primer if you want
but I like to use my Urban Decay Naked
concealer I put it all over the lid and
then I blend out with a brush today i am
using the morphe 8 brush you can use a
Beauty Blender I just don't use my
fingers because I feel like it's patchy
and I don't get as much coverage and my
eyeshadow doesn't look as good and then
I absolutely have to set it with powder
I'm using the Mac Pro emphasised powder
but a translucent powder would work face
powder any sort of powder is going to
make the eyeshadows go on more smooth
and blend easier so for the first shadow
I'm going to pick up one of my all-time
favorites which is makeup geek creme
brulee literally I think I've gone
through six pans of this eyeshadow like
the dedication is beyond I'm going to
start off by applying this in the upper
crease area also known as the transition
color and I'm going to be using a
long-haired natural brush to apply this
and the reason why is because I do not
want this to be concentrated on any
particular area I want it to be very
feathery and lightweight and airbrushed
and seamless on the entire upper
area then I'm going to go in with a
Nastasia burnt orange and I'm going to
continue to use that exact same brush
this is the morphe m4 for one and I want
to use this because I want everything to
look so blended I don't want anything to
be packed on at this point I don't want
to use like a short dense brush and the
reason I'm going so in-depth about
brushes today is because I feel like so
many people think that they can't do
their makeup when really it's not them
it's not the product but it's the
brushes if you understand your brushes
then you can understand makeup you can
understand how to apply makeup your
tools are so important so right now I'm
sticking with a long hair natural
bristle I'm going to now pick up Sean
and this is again by Anastasia this is a
little bit darker and a little bit more
neutral and shade and with that exact
same brush I'm going to concentrate this
just on the outer corner of the eye you
can see I'm kind of swooping it and
rounding it out to create the eye shape
that I want my shadow to be if you do
not have a natural crease that's the
beauty of makeup you can create one and
just stick with the technique and it
will come out just the same now I'm
going to pick up Anastasia
fudge I didn't realize this was such an
Anastacio day Hey
budge is one of my favorite dark Browns
ever it's like the color of like warm
chocolate I love it
so now to apply this I changed my brush
and now I'm using the M 4-3-3 brush by
morphe which looks very similar to the
first one we use it's just a little bit
shorter and denser so it can pack on
product and now you see I'm using that
because the fact that I'm packing on
this dark shade and I want it to be more
concentrated when I'm working with a
dark color I like to pack it on by doing
pouncing motions and then I go back and
forth and I start blending it out I
never go in and just start blending
immediately with a dark shade otherwise
it can look patchy and kind of break up
and have fallout like to pack things on
going up and down in a pouncing motion
and then blend it out once it's on the
lid hopefully that makes sense and then
before moving on I'm going to make sure
that we have no harsh lines on the upper
crease and just go over it one more time
with a little bit more of that burnt
orange on my brush because honey let's
get real I for your harsh lines like I
fear the devil now for my lid color I'm
going to be using makeup geek foiled
eyeshadow in the shade
and stand this is my favorite foiled
eyeshadow by makeup geek it's actually
the only one that I completely used up
and had to purchase a second one because
I love it that much it doesn't matter if
I have a spray tan or if I'm Ferriss can
be I love it just as much any day of the
week so I'm going to pack that on the
entire and
corner of the lid but I'm not going to
take it all the way across the whole lid
I don't want to cover up what we did
with fudge and the beautiful Browns that
we have on so just the inner corner I
want that to have a pop and I'm just
going over the edge of it with a little
bit of fudge on my brush just to make
sure that everything blends together
because we don't want it to be like boom
grandstand boom fudge we want it to be a
nice like ombre effect as it fades into
the other colors now I'm going to go in
and create my wing and honey I'm going
to create a wing so sharp and so harsh
and so elongated but if I want to take
flight and fly away from all the
 I'll just wait and Akane cue
the other weapon I can also have my
option as well I am using the Maybelline
gel liner in blackest black this is my
favorite gel liner I have used so many
of them and I swear to god Maybelline
still makes the best gel liner in my
opinion if you guys have one that you
think is better please because I'm
always looking for an upgrade but
honestly like this gel liner is
everything to me so I've done my liner
the same way for a very very long time I
create a line from the corner of my eye
up towards the tail of my brow and then
I just kind of like fill in the blank
like I create the wing and I fill it in
and after I put on some lashes I am
gonna go back and make my wing even a
little bit more intense because I
realized I could do better so with a
quick coat of mascara I'm gonna go in
with velour lashes and these are in the
style lash in the city they're like
those really pretty fluffy lashes that
kind of have a wing on the outer corner
so they give you more of like a cat eye
effect and I think that they are so
beautiful with Ling winged liner like if
you just put on a winged liner with no
shadow whatsoever and these lashes
you're gonna immediately have a cat eye
because they're just such beautiful cat
eye lashes which is why I love them like
a fierce nighttime or girls night out
look they're just so gorgeous one of my
favorites I'm just making sure that I
have my liner black as can be so I'm
going over the line make sure after you
go over your line of lashes do not look
upward towards the ceiling
otherwise your liner will transfer onto
your lid and then you won't be able to
clean that up and that's not cute
I have breakdowns about those types of
things okay guys it's very scary so I'm
going to prime at my face using the
makeup forever a radiant primer I forgot
how much I love this because I've been
using the Becca luminous primer so much
recently it's been months inside you
this one and I really really love it
again I'm going to be using the Josie
Maran vibrancy foundation but I am gonna
have to mix it because I am so fair
right now so I'm using some Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation that I'm
talking way too fast I'm sorry
mama needs to calm down okay
I'm mixing a little bit of a lighter
foundation just for the simple fact that
I was way too white for my foundation so
I had to lighten it up a little bit and
I am applying that with a morphe m4 3:9
foundation brush this is my favorite
foundation brush for a very very long
time and then I'm going to do my under
eye concealer and I only had two shades
I had one that was too light and I had
one that was too dark so I'm mixing two
different shades as you can see and this
is the Urban Decay Naked weightless
concealer my favorite concealer ever I
believe but again if you guys have any
recommendations for concealers that are
amazing that you can't live without
please give me your recommendations
because concealers are one of those
things I feel like there's only like two
or three concealers I've ever tried that
I actually love and I'm always looking
for new concealers always always always
and I am using a damp a Beauty Blender
by the way to just blend all of this out
and the reason I put the light concealer
in the center of the forehead and the
center of the face is just to even
everything out so that it looks more
natural if you will you know because
this is just super natural you guys I'm
using the RCM a no color powder which is
a translucent powder and a damp Beauty
Blender under my eye to set the
under-eye area this has been my favorite
way to set my under eye recently it just
looks so seamless and it's very very
matte so what I'm going to do is pick up
a little bit of the Mac Pro emphasized
powder which is kind of like a highlight
powder but it's not shimmery it's like a
satin it's not a full map but it's not a
shimmer it looks really really beautiful
I'm going to use that on the under eye
area and I'm applying that with a m43
eight brush many different brands have
brushes very similar to this but this
one is by morphe and I'm actually using
that highlight powder kind of all over
my face because of the fact that I am so
fair right now I'm using it on my chin
I'm kind of bringing it down by my upper
lip I'm putting on my forehead I'm kind
of putting it everywhere because as you
can see I'm very white right now for me
before me I know that there's people
there way way way more light than me but
this is like the lightest that I can
possibly get so I'm
to fill in my brows using the Anastasia
brow definer which has been the only way
that I've done my brows ever since the
brow definer came out it's my favorite
way to do my brows honestly my brows you
should be a struggle now it's the
easiest thing I do it takes me like
literally three minutes tops
maybe it's such a fast process now
because I've got like my entire routine
like down packed with this brow definer
I love it so much I brush my brows down
I fill it on top I brush them in I fill
them in on bottom boom Shakalaka good to
go I'm going to be using the Physicians
Formula butter bronzer god this stuff
smells so good and I'm going to be
applying it with a big ole Tom four
brush this brush is so expensive I've
talked about it before but honestly
there's nothing like it it's kind of
frustrating because I'm like why why do
you have to be so expensive and so
beautiful at the same time right but I'm
going to apply that bronzer all over the
outer portion of my face all around my
cheekbones my jawline all my temples my
hairline my forehead and then I'm going
to do just a little bit of cleaning up
and I'm going to take that same RCM a no
color transfer scent powder and I'm
going to just create a sharp line from
the corner of my ear down to the corner
of my lip so we can just bake that a
little bit so my contour won't get messy
throughout the day and it'll look a
little bit more cleaned up if you want
an in-depth tutorial on baking I do have
one that I uploaded last month you can
check that out on my channel and then
I'm going to take a little bit more of
burnt orange I'm using the same shadows
I use on my upper lid and now on my
lower lid take any pencil brush this is
an e3 I believe from the morphe Elite
Collection and I'm going to just blend
that on the entire lower lash line I'm
taking it all the way to the inner
corner all the way to the outer corner
and then I'm going to pick up fudge by
anastasiya again and I am using like a
small precision brush to apply fudge to
my lower lash line this one is by Sigma
I don't know the exact number of it but
it is on their website this one is from
the extravaganza collection which is why
it's like a goldish rose gold on the
ferrule and not just the regular silver
but I'm going to take fudge and I'm
going to press it into the lash line all
the way into the inner tear-duct all the
way and connect it to the outer corner
to my winged liner so it's completely
around it out and very defined and then
I'll just go back in with any pencil
brush and just blend that out so we have
no harsh lines
this is the part of the tutorial that
really makes the eye makeup look this is
the most important part if you ask me
I'm going to be taking the exact same
Maybelline gel liner that I used to
create my wing and I'm going to put on
my entire waterline including my tear
duct on the inner corner this is what's
going to give you that like really
fierce almond eye effect it's going to
kind of create a cat eye without being
too catty you know what I'm saying
because we're not going to actually draw
on the skin but we're getting it all the
way to the inner tear duct and it's just
really going to bring attention to the
eyes and make your eye color stand out
it'll make your eyes look a little bit
more slanted it's just a really
beautiful technique and I've been doing
it so much recently and every single
time I do this I get so many compliments
on my eyes and I swear it's because of
this technique right here bringing it
all the way into the inner corner on the
top and the bottom and really making
sure that entire area is black now I'm
going to grab any black shadow you have
doesn't matter and I'm going to go in Oh
cute face Jaclyn that is really really
attractive honey anyways I'm going to
grab that same brush and just pack on
some black shadow right over top of all
of that and blend out so that everything
stays in place and nothing is going to
fall and smudge and again so everything
looks nice and blended and I'm going to
put some mascara on my lower lashes I am
using the Mac extended play lash one of
my favorite mascaras for lower lashes
and then I'm going to pick up the
champagne collection face palette yay
and I'm going to be using amaretto as my
blush don't ask I couldn't find my blush
brush anywhere so I just use this random
brush that's like for under-eye powder
and I decided to use that because you
got to make it work right so I made it
work so I'm going to pack amaretto I'm
sorry amaretto on my entire cheek area
back towards the temples and then I'm
going to highlight I am using
champagne pop right on the apples of my
cheeks I'm applying this with a morphe
510 brush and then once I get back to
the high points of the cheekbones I'm
going to put on some Prosecco pop as you
see me doing right now this is the way
I've been highlighting for a very long
time because I just love the ombre
effect of the gold on my cheekbones and
the more champagne color on the center
of my cheeks I know how people don't
like applying a highlight to the center
of their cheeks the apples their cheeks
but I personally love it so I encourage
you to do you I'm doing me boo so I'm
just going to take a little bit more of
the Jeffrey star ice cool
just put that right over top of
champagne popped that way I just have
like a very big highlight because you
know me I like sending signals to space
is what I do I'm going to go in with a
Nastasia liquid lip in the shade naked I
was trying to think goes like what color
is this I'm going to apply that all over
my lips and then once that's dry I'm
going to apply Marc Jacobs moon glow
over top of it which is a very very pale
gloss but I love the nude lip that it
gives me it's like not too nude not too
pink not too brown it's like my perfect
perfect glossy nude lips so yeah that
completes look you guys I hope you enjoy
thanks for watching I love you and I'll
see you soon bye guys
