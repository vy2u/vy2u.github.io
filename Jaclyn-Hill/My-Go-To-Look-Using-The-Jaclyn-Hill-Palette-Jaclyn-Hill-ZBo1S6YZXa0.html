has been a while it's been on wow it's
actually fit Oh like a long last time
for today's video I'm going to be doing
my go-to makeup look that I have been
wearing like crazy recently with the
eyes and the lips face the whole shebang
I am of course going to be using it
talking get it together my place right
here with morphe i see all of your
requests on social media things have
just been absolutely crazy recently not
just with my life but if then with
everybody's like like things have just
been absolutely insane i was like
watching the news obsessively last week
in Chicago just like is this really
happening like it's actually happening
like as Berlin was happening it's like
hurricane Harvey happen or EMA happen
and like Oh God like honestly there was
so many things happening in other
countries going on as well and
earthquakes and tsunamis and tornadoes
it was just like such a crazy week for
humanity and I was in Chicago which is
where my family went to evacuate went to
downtown for like two days and then we
left and we went to the suburbs a lot I
was sitting there and did my makeup
every single day which is weird because
here at home I leave do my makeup like
two days a week when I was there I did
almost every single day that I was there
they're so strange but it was like my
way of coping with like the fear of what
was going on I mean used to obsessing
over everything like it's just what I do
you know what I went there and I went to
Sephora and I like bucks like makeup for
my friends all up there like I just like
clogged my mind with makeup while I was
in Chicago because it just was making me
distract myself from things I can't
change you know so anyways while I was
there I did the basically this exact
same look every single day when I was
away in Chicago and every sometimes I
would post a photo on snapchat I would
always get so many tweets actually need
to do a makeup tutorial on this look so
it's exactly what I'm doing today so
this is basically like an All MAC look
on the I actually love it and this lip
combination like I'm freaking obsessed
with very monochromatic with the lips
and the eyes I'm all about this life for
me this is like my go-to look no matter
what the occasion is my palate is really
socking very very very soon and I'll put
all the information in the description
box below because I'm doing the exact
day tomorrow so my
video I will have the information for
you and I'll put in my drop down box
right beneath this video but I just want
to say thank you so much to you guys
before jumping into this video for just
all the kind words I've been receiving
and all of the encouragement and not
only that constructive criticism because
I appreciate constructive criticism so
much of more than you know but I think
it's funny because people leave comments
and if you're ugly I was being
constructive in my I have been so caught
up in my own life and what's been going
on behind the camera and also things
that have been going on on social media
I've been so wrapped up in it like this
whirlwind and your constructive
criticism really brings me back to like
people letting me know like Jacqueline
you need to get back on YouTube and use
some of it tutorial we want to see you
use that path we've spent money on and
we miss your makeup tutorials and I'm
just like hell yeah that's what I need
to do you know I appreciate you guys
letting me know what you need from me
here on YouTube the social media like it
really doesn't mean like to me so I love
you guys and to all of you who have been
affected by all the natural disasters
recently I am so I am so sorry there's
an anemic day like honestly guys say I'm
sorry if this is still not enough think
about it every single day and I'm just
so sorry about everybody who's been
affected and who has lost their homes
and their animals and all their material
possessions and can't get to their
families like I'm just yeah I'm sorry
and I love you guys so much and thank
you for all your well wishes and prayers
towards my family but we are 100% okay
so no worries whatsoever there so let's
go ahead and jump into the video and do
some makeup no no no really
whenever I see a girl in public like on
social media like with just foundation
and brows I'm always just like how how
are you pulling this off and making it
look so effortlessly beautiful beze I
feel like I just look like so for
today's video I really want to focus on
just the eye since using my palette is
the most requested thing right now I
thought that I'll really do you guys
like an in-depth I look tutorial and
that's why I just did my brows and my
foundation off camera and I'll do the
eyes onto the cheeks I'll do the lips on
camera let me just zoom you in so my
eyes are already primed
make sure that you do that as an
absolute must when it comes to your eye
makeup if you don't prime your eyes
you're not gonna have the outcome that
you really desire I'm gonna start off by
taking the third color and the palette
which is the shade of silk cream this is
the more if you are 37 but it does not
matter if it's morphe if it's math if
it's whoever in the world I would just
suggest going in with a natural hair
brush initially because it's going to
just put everything on really light and
buff it out really smooth and not from
too much pigment so I was gonna start on
the outer corner and begin to buff this
kind of up in that transition area
whenever I do say the term transition
area I'm referring to this area right
here between the lid and the brow bone
so lid grab on and this is transition
area right in between those two I gosh
you guys I am so excited to watch
hocus-pocus I know that's so random but
I just can't stop thinking about it I
think I'm seeing so much like Halloween
and fall stuff all over social media and
I'm like oh my god okay focus
I'm not weirdo who watches hocus pocus
every single year until Christmas
because once Halloween comes and goes
I'm just like wait no I'm not ready to
say goodbye so I'm just blending this
back and forth I always start off in
windshield wiper motions just like this
and I always kind of get a circular
motion going on and as there is
basically no product left on my brush of
them went buffing bla buffing it from
the outer corner I'm just going to
slightly bring it into the inner corner
but we really don't want too much
products and here otherwise it's gonna
just kind of weigh our eyes down and not
give us like that fresh awake look it's
gonna make us look a little more tired
in a corner all right now I'm gonna grab
the shade butter and the palette and
this one definitely has like an orange
II very warm undertone so if you don't
want to use that undertone you don't
have to use this shade you could use any
of the macarons in this palette but this
is the one that I built in with so in
between every single shadow you just
want to make sure you blend it out
because it will make everything just be
seamless at the end baby okay so now I'm
gonna take the shade in the center
palette which is a super super warm baby
up Yukiya brown and it is called pukey
for obvious reasons
losing the exact same brush by the way
that I initially start off with and I'm
on my third color so I'm gonna now at
this point bring it just a little bit
lower
that transition area as before I was
blending it a higher up now I'm going to
be keeping it really nice and precise
which is why I love this brush because
it does have like that tapered tip so it
allows me to get like a little bit
tighter when I need to
okay so now at this point I'm gonna grab
some of the cover up X perfect setting
powder which is just an amazing
transition powder and I'm going to begin
to the car out the shape of the eye
makeup look that I want I've done this
so many times it's just become like my
thing that I have to do every single
time I do my makeup it just makes it so
easy for me and foolproof and when I
first showed you guys this eyelid it
thought that I created this I was like I
created this technique like I discovered
this like thank you where's my award and
then thousands of people were like
you're an idiot and this has been done
so many times before Doc's like but in
my mind I created it and so now I'll go
back in with that brush and I'll just
kind of blend it to that translucent
powder and it will just catch any of the
excess and just create the shape that I
want yes there's nothing I love more
than blended shadow I swear to God are
so satisfying all right now I'm going to
take the shade of buns right here and in
shade mocha right here I'm going to mix
those two together you can go in with
just one or the other but I don't know
why this these I just mix these two
shapes all the time
then take a little swirl of each then
tap off the excess and I'm just gonna
bring that much lower on the eye area so
everything before has been more in the
transition area and the glower crease
now this is actually going on the lid
itself just only in the outer corner I
always just kind of stamp it first using
the blending brush and then once I stamp
it then I start to do really small kind
of motion I don't like circular motions
but just kind of like really small
jiggles and that's kind of how I
initially place the color down and then
I start to move around in little tiny
circular motions all right I'm gonna
grab the shade pooter right here every
single time I feel me I'll ask makes me
John every single time I use it I'm
going to tap off the excess that was
gonna so like a brilliant get my brush
you know let it go over this entire area
now that we have the dark and the light
floors put down pooter is my favorite
color on the palette from my skin tone
to really blend everything together like
it's that perfect middleman it's not too
late it's not too dark now I'm gonna
grab a wittle itsy-bitsy tiny blending
brush I love a little any of your I love
it hold on I love little itty bitty
brushes like this one before packing on
color in the outer corner so I'm gonna
grab some sexual perk right here which
is the darkest deepest brown in the
palette and I'm going to put that in the
very very outer corner and I just build
this really slow a bit tiny bit at times
I don't want to let go in with anything
too harsh or anything that can't be
blended out and make a mistake that I
can't erase just a tiny bit at a time I
guess you can see I'm really precisely
where I'm putting it I don't want to
take a deep color like this and go in
and start blending it all around
otherwise it can kind of ruin we did it
so it's a little tiny bit at a time
I'm gonna go in with some in light which
is the very first shade in the palette
on just a stiff synthetic brush this is
the Mac 242 I'm going to put that in the
very inner corner of my eye I'm obsessed
with highlighting in my inner corner
with the shaders might go to like no
matter what color I am like how dark I
am how light I am I just love and light
so much for highlighting purposes I'm
going to grab some the Kat Von D the
first color in her shade and light
palette I'm going to just put that right
over top
all right so now that we are done with
that part I'm going to go ahead and grab
any brush and just wipe away that
translucent powder and you'll see what I
mean
by the way it gives you it this nice
line but it's soft it's like this harsh
scary intense line
I used to use scotch tape all the time
for any sort of method like this and it
was just so harshly so intense and if
they were uneven it was like very very
very difficult to correct but with this
it's like you can do it or top of your
foundation you don't have to make sure
you do it your eyes person like Scott
solo I can't talk scotch tape and on top
of it if it is uneven it's really easy
to fix you just go right back in with
the brush and just clean it up and it's
just like it's like a magic eraser for
your makeup I love it
all right so now for the lower lash line
I'm going to go back in with the shade Q
key on a pencil brush any kind for brush
will do and I'm just going to blend that
all the way from the outer corner to
almost all the way to the inner corner
all right now I'm gonna grab some mocha
on a really stiff definer brush like
this guy right here and I'm gonna place
that right on my lower lash line a
pretty generous amount I'm gonna bring
it almost all the way into the inner
corner I want to say almost and I'm not
gonna bring it all the way in to the
tear duct I'm gonna stop it like right
here on the eye because if we bring it
all the way in it's gonna get really
harsh really fast and I don't the lower
lash going to be too harsh I'm gonna go
back in with the pencil brush and the
same QP shade again and I'm just going
to blend that out now just because I
feel like it I'm gonna grab the black
shading that palette right here just
called abyss I still wish I would've
made it something better than that but I
could not think of something to name it
so I was just like forget it I'm just
gonna call him abyss it just seems so
typical better I'm gonna take that black
I'm gonna put it right there only on the
outer corner of the lower lash just to
really give it some depth and dimension
over there and is bad the kind of cat
eye effect that we're doing so now at
this point of the eye look the eye
shadow portion is kind of coming to an
end so you could do whatever you wanted
now with your liner you can do no liner
you could do a winged liner you can just
do line up straight across the lid for
me I'm gonna go in with some eye shadow
that's just what I've been doing
recently it's so easy so that exact same
brush I'm just gonna stamp that black
shadow right there directly on my lash
lines to keep it nice and soft so now
for my lashes I'm going to be using it
in the blinking Butte silk lashes in the
style bomb vest and they are so freaking
beautiful I wear these constantly in
Chicago I reuse these four times while I
was there I guys kept killing off the
glue and using them again because I just
think they're so beautiful like come on
look at that lash is that not so
freaking beautiful like yes I I love
this is like my new favorite lash right
now I'm into it I'm gonna be going in
with the Mac coma graphic pencil in the
shade nc15 slash nw20
it's not a white white to the creamy
kind of flesh tone color I'm gonna just
place that right in there this is one of
the absolute fastest most foolproof
makeup tricks to making your eyes look
more awake and just wide and bright and
just fresh all around it and going in
with the extended play gigablack lash by
Mac it's my favorite mascara and of the
lower lashes
alright I'm gonna grab some in light
which is the very first shade in the
palette it's a tiny bit of that when I
brush like a tiny tiny bit I'm just
gonna double that right here and if the
brows s when I highlight that I said I
like that I just want to highlight that
ever so softly I don't want to be too
intense though it's pretty bit okay so
now I'm going to be moving on to the
face and first thing to do is Braun I'm
going to be using the lemare bronzing
powder in the shade the most expensive
overpriced bronzer in the world okay
perfect I'm going to be going in with
that on a Smashbox brush this is called
the sheer powder brush
they sent me these maybe like two weeks
ago when I took them to me when I were
too shook up took them with me around
and I've been using a bunch of them and
I have been loving these Smashbox
brushes I was gonna apply a light sheer
amount of this bronzer on my face
bronzer is my favorite thing to apply on
my entire face that's I ever told you
guys that but there's a fact about me oh
girl fill in that hairline I'm coming
for you boo boo I'm coming okay so now
that I haven't got really sheer wash on
bronzer over my face I'm gonna go in
with the Kat Von D shade light contour
palette I'm gonna take this middle
contour shade right here and kind of a
stiffer dome brush this is the morphine
III I'm gonna dab it around in there and
it's going to really lightly create a
contour line
I'm gonna grab a little bit more of that
cover up X perfecting a powder and I am
going to just slightly bake if you will
I don't even consider this is baking
anymore because like I don't even leave
it on for that long I just put it on my
face and I wipe it off like 30 seconds
later and for my nose contour I'm going
to go back in with the same Kat Von D
shade and light palette just a
suggestion if you are going to contour
your nose match it to the contour on
your cheeks or match it to something
happening on your cheeks like if you're
using like a really warm bra but really
warm bronzer then you won't want to go
in with a super cool tone nose contour
because it'll clash so I am gonna go
with the exact same color that I use on
my cheek to contour my nose I would all
kind of come together and it's cohesive
that's right work computer
she's looking a real cute you know what
I was gonna go ahead and fill in my
hairline right now because I can't take
it for one more second everyone fills in
their hairline differently I personally
just use a brush like this it's just a
synthetic hair brush it's in the more
feet and 5:05 I'm gonna take two shapes
of my palate and they're taking shape
circle per an abyss which is the really
dark brown in the black I'm gonna take
the majority of Central Perk but then
also get a doubt of abyss and all I do
is I just go in there and I start
filling in my bald ass you know I
started doing this several months ago
and now that I started that get
something that I would probably never
stop in my routine
because now when I wake up in the
morning all I notice is just my bald
spot Tyler what next I swear like in 10
years my like beauty routine he's gonna
be at six hours long okay let's wipe all
this away
I'm gonna take this naked forever blush
right here in the shade be 3:08 it's
like a really really beautiful Matt
Gourley pink I'm going to trying out
these new hourglass highlights which I
was so excited I put this package in the
mail because hourglass has these two
beautiful highlight so they always
highlight forever and they're just like
so soft and like natural and just like
that glow from within but these are a
metallic glow Swedes are called the
metallic strobe lighting palette so I
have been really excited about these I'm
gonna use the middle share the yellow
one and then this is darker one I
believe oh yes oh yeah that's that's
intense what's that like okay I'm gonna
set the brows and clear brow gel alright
so now for my lips I have been asked so
much the past week what the combination
I have been wearing and it has been
several different things up one day it
was candy K bye piyah cosmetics another
day it was a liquid lipstick by morphe
in that care over the name right now but
I'll be putting in my favorites video
because I've been loving it recently I'm
gonna be others for the last two or
three days I was wearing this
combination or right here which is
Lolita by Kat Von D with bow and arrow
over top I am obsessed with this
combination they're both so beautiful on
their own but combined I'm just like Oh
all right so now that we have Lolita I'm
gonna go in with bow and arrow just
directly on top of it
like this lip combination is just
perfect in my eyes like perfect I'm just
gonna grab some setting spray and just
text me
one district artists on YouTube for once
first I'm gonna do start with you guys
not not me - I'm going to go up with the
breaking video chaplain and he'll
secretly flips off her subscribers and
tell them to go to hell
