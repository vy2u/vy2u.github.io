to be doing my go-to smoky eye look for
you
first of all yes obviously my background
is different I basically just like 180
to my camera so you are looking directly
at what I am typically looking at when
I'm filming that make sense for those of
you who did ask on my Instagram what
this storage unit is called from Ikea
and about the mirror and the drawers and
everything I have I'm going to link
every single detail in the description
bar below for you so that you guys can
check that out if you're curious about
what's happening back here um I'm still
indecisive about my permit background
here on my channel and all my friend
shades for this room have not come in
yet I don't have my curtains or all my
furniture which is why I still have the
echo that drives me off the wall um I do
have wood floors and like 14 foot
ceilings in this specific room so the
echo is off the chizzain
anyways so today I'm going to be doing
it my go-to smokey eye look this is
actually the exact look that I wore my
August favorites video 2013 I'll link
that down below if you're like what I
have gotten so many requests for this
eye look and I did not realize how many
requests I got until yesterday I was
just kind of looking and reviewing old
comments like I tried to do and I was
blown away by how many requests I have
gotten for this look and I felt really
bad so I was like okay we're doing this
I knew exactly what products it was
because I've been wearing this look ever
since then and it's so easy so simple
and it's gonna look good on pretty much
everyone which I always try to make sure
before filming a video because I do not
want to share technique in prior
knowledge it's only going to be geared
towards certain people and not everyone
can utilize it themselves at all I want
you all to feel beautiful and all people
wear these looks so I really hope that
you enjoy try and keep up with me in
this video as you can tell I like a
little today more than usual I'm
exhausted
which is why my eyes are like crazy
bloodshot I don't know about you but my
eyes burn when I'm
Aaron so anyways I'm a little all over
the place but I'm pretty sure you guys
are used to that if you've been a
subscriber of mine for more than five
minutes so I love you guys so much
I'm going to go wash my face I have a
date with a bowl of ice cream and hot
math TMI I don't care I love you guys I
hope you enjoy bye
II sleepy okay I'm pulling myself
together because we have a tutorial to
do I'm starting off with no makeup and a
clean face and first thing I'm doing is
priming my eyes for shadow I am using
the pro longwear concealer by Mac I
prefer to use this as my eye primer
pretty much all the time because it can
peel conceals any blood vessels or veins
or redness while priming for eye shadow
so what gets better than that then using
a sigma I shadow base this is in the
shade compose it's this really nice
neutral creamy brown but when it dries
it's no longer creamy and wet so it's
not going to crease and it really helps
keep your eye shadows more intense and
gives it more depth and makes them last
longer I am using an e39 brush to apply
this just in windshield wiper motions
and make sure you get it all the way up
into that crease it's better to go a
little bit above the crease then not go
high up enough just make sure you get it
in the crease then we are working from
the Anastasia lavish palette today
pretty much as our main colors I'm going
in with orange soda on a fluffy brush
and I'm going to dust this right above
on that line where we ended composed
back and forth and windshield wiper
motions you know the drill
how many times have you heard me say
windshield wiper motions with a fluffy
brush so from all the way inner corner
to outer corner we're just going to go
back and forth buffing this out you can
see the more we go back and forth the
more the lines are going to disappear
then we're going to go in with sienna
which is a gorgeous burnt red orange e
rusty color using an e30 eight brush by
Sigma which by the way both these
brushes so far are in the perfect blend
kit I believe but I'll link that all
down below well I'm just going to again
go all the way from inner corner to
outer corner then with a clean brush
with no additional product I'm just
going to blend everything out so that
nothing is harsh then going in with rum
cake which I am obsessed and the same a
thirty nine brush that I used to apply
compose eyeshadow base I am just going
to run this all along that area from
inner corner to outer corner I love this
color
oh my gosh I wish that I could buy it
separately it is so beautiful it just
glows every time I wear this eye shadow
I get
compliments and is just so pretty then
I'm going to go in with eyeliner I
started off using the Maybelline eye
studio gel liner and then I actually
switched over to makeup geek immortal
because immortal is the blackest black
gel liner in the world and I wanted it
to be black so you can see I just traced
the eyeliner and then filled it in and
then bada-bing bada-boom then I'm going
to go in with false lashes I'm using a
velour lashes and you can see the
difference
voila they are so natural and fluffy
this exact pair is strike a pose my
absolute fave then using Tarte Mara
tjuku foundation I'm not quite sure how
to pronounce that I'm going to buff this
all over my skin using a sigma f80 flat
top kabuki brush and let me just say oh
my gosh without giving too much away
this foundation is my absolute obsession
so as always you can see the foundation
obviously does not match my skin but it
matches my neck so I did go over my lips
just to cancel out all discoloration on
my face and then we're gonna kind of
like go over top of that and build up to
bringing the color back then I'm going
to go ahead and conceal my under eye
area again using Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and an f-86 brush from Sigma
to buff this out I just love this brush
so much for my concealer it is the best
brush I've ever used because it just
picks up any excess concealer and it
pretty much makes it and oh yeah let me
put myself in the eye they're pretty
much impossible to have cakey concealer
underneath your eye it just it's perfect
then going in with a bare minerals
stroke of light in the shade luminous -
this is a very nice sheer highlighter
and I'm just going to place it on the
high points of the face to highlight so
the forehead the Cupid's bow the chin
around the nose and around the lips
where we all hormonal II tend to get red
and blotchy I'm going to just highlight
those areas and cover them up just to
fake it till we make it blending that
all out with my same foundation brush I
like to use my foundation brush to blend
out highlights because I think it ends
up looking much more natural than using
a whole separate brush because getting a
mixture of the foundation and the
highlight usually makes everything look
a lot more natural
you're probably natural where anyways
I'm
going to comb through my brows and I am
using Anastasia brow is today I will
link my brow video down below for an
in-depth tutorial I am using the shade
ash blonde on the inner corner and then
caramel on the outer corner I've been
loving loving the caramel shade recently
these two combined
I just adore anyway so as you can see I
am just going to go ahead fill in and
then brush everything out to give it a
more natural appearance and then I'm
going to sculpt and shape it a little
bit just by using some concealer on a
flat definer brush just to help with the
highlight and just to sculpt them out a
little bit in bada BAM done then going
in with the Anastasia contour and
highlight palette I am going to use this
banana shade and mix it with Mac Pro
emphasize as you know I have used
emphasize forever to highlight and I
just sometimes feel like it's too easy
to get a very heavy hand so mixing it
with this banana color is just like made
in the shade
perfection it is the best highlight
color and it's just going to set my
under eye concealer so nothing moves or
creases then I am using Smashbox suntan
matte bronzer and my NARS eita brush I
know last time I mentioned the ITO brush
and I got a lot of comments from you
guys saying if you couldn't understand
what I was saying so eita ITA brush I
absolutely love this brush I've raved
about it for quite a while and I am just
going to sculpt the face with an eye
look like this you can really make your
contour pretty dramatic and get away
with it since we've got that whole
dramatic eye look going on then is
buffing it out with a Marc Jacobs
foundation brush I believe this is the
foundation to brush but again I'll have
all that information below then I am
just going to take that same Sienna
color on a small little pretty brush and
I am just going to line that whole lower
lash line all the way to the inner rim
with this look you really don't want to
stop halfway through you want to bring
it all the way in just to make that eye
look pop and really make it look smoky
then on a pencil brush I'm going back in
with a little bit of orange soda and
this is where you just want to blend
blend blend blend and blend no fear just
keep blending back and forth this is
really important when
any sort of smokey eye then using makeup
geek mocha which is just a super dark
true brown this is such a necessity
color and anyone's makeup collection
because it really helps amp up any smoky
eye I'm just gonna put that in the outer
corner just for more dimension and then
I'm just going back and covering up my
eyeliner because if you could see I was
having shadow falling all over it and it
was turning into a little bit of a hot
mess then we're going to go in with Mac
nylon which is a super intense highlight
but we're just going to barely touch it
on the very top high point of that brow
just for a little bit of highlight I
like that it has a little yellow in it
but again it is intense so make sure
that you do not just like slam it on
your face because it'll be like disco
ball so highlighting those inner corners
just to give a little bit more pop and
then just mascara the bottom lashes I'm
using Rimmel lash accelerator and then
I'm going in with the Kardashian chroma
stick in baby doll and I'm obviously
just going to apply this you guys know
exactly how to do this on yourself I'm
sure and then I'm going to top it off
with one of my fading losses at the
moment which is actually by a company
called whitening lightening and this is
in the shade nude and yes it does have a
light that is shining on my lips right
now and I am just going to top that off
I absolutely love this combination of
these two together it's my favorite at
the moment and then I know everything is
going so weird but I'm going to go in
with margin blush a little confusing
normally you do this before lips but
whatever I told you I'm exhausted try to
keep up so just hitting margin blush and
blending it in with that contour going
backward but you want the main color to
be on the apples of the cheeks but just
keep blending okay try not to fall
asleep there Jacqueline then using the
Becca shimmering skin Perfector in the
shade opal with just one small swipe we
are only going to touch this on that
high point of the cheekbones and blend
it out we don't want too much that's
overwhelming to this look and then once
we have it on the cheek then we'll tap
it on the chin and the Cupid's bow and
then just a tiny bit on the center of
the nose up towards the top where it's
more flattering boom this is an extra
bonus you don't have to do this I just
wanted to recommend that instead of
doing a basic black you could
something like Costa reached by Mac
which Kim Kardashian's makeup artist
used on her about three years ago and
I've been in love ever since it's this
gorgeous burnt red color this nice deep
warm brown and it just gives an extra
pop to this look as opposed to just
using a basic black in there I really
like this alternative so I really hope
you guys enjoy I love you so much as
always thanks for watching I'll see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
