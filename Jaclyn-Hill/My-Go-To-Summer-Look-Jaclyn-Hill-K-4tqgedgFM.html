a makeup tutorial for you I posted a
photo on Instagram a few days ago of
this face telling you that this was my
go-to summer makeup look and so many of
you were requesting that I do a tutorial
that I figured I would throw one
together for you I was planning on doing
this tutorial later when it's more
summer time because some of you are
probably like really it's 25 degrees
right now here in Florida it is 80
degrees and sunny don't be jealous
it's really beautiful outside so I'm
definitely in the spring and summer mood
especially when it comes to my makeup
because as I've said 500 times I am so
in love with the spring and summer
trends this year so just to clarify this
is a look that will be indoor
appropriate and air conditioning in the
summertime so go into the movies
shopping hanging out your friends going
on a date this is going to be a look
appropriate where there is air
conditioning this is not a look for the
pool or the beach of the park where
you're going to be sweating off your
makeup that is a totally different look
with much less product so I really hope
that you guys enjoy this tutorial thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you soon right
Hot Mess hair and boom and a bug let me
cut it with Georgie for two seconds so
that he's not barking at me the entire
video then we're going to moisturize our
lips using a bite Beauty agave lip mask
we are going to rub that all over our
lip ease because doing this in the
beginning will make sure that when you
apply your lip at the end it goes on
nice and smooth then we're going to
prime our skin using Tarte clean slate
flawless
this is the brightening primer we are
going to warm this up on our finger tips
make sure your hands are freshly clean
otherwise this is a great way to spread
bacteria we are going to press this
primer into our skin because pressing
primer into your skin in a dabbing
motion will help the longevity of your
foundation and make everything look a
lot better and go on a lot smoother then
we're going to go in with Laura Mercier
moisture supreme foundation and Chanel
so late and a Chanel I'm just going to
dribble that on the back of my hand and
kind of mix it in with my foundation as
I see fit
using the Sigma f80 kabuki brush as
always I am going to go in dabbing
motions and then I go in circular
motions but I always start off in
dabbing motions as you can see because
it really helps again press the
foundation into the skin and adhere to
that primer and in your pores it really
does help with the longevity of your
foundation pressing and not just going
in and rubbing so press and then rub if
that makes sense so as you can see this
was a darker foundation than my face but
it matches perfectly with my neck since
I exfoliate so often my face is always
like fifty five shades lighter then a
quick tip take a tissue dab it on your
skin don't rub just dab this will soak
up any excess oil or any excess
foundation so that it looks better and
lasts longer then going in with Mac Pro
Longwear concealer favorite concealer of
life no matter what concealers I love
this is always my favorite we are going
to just dab that in with our middle
finger starting in the inner corner
pressing up toward the temple and then
going in with a sigma f80 six brush to
blend that all out I will also go over
the eyelid area just to prime the eyes
for shadow later a quick tip when you
are putting on your shadow at the end
I'm not just shadow your concealer at
the end take that brush and go inward
going in an inward motion will really
make sure that your concealer doesn't
crease if that's the last step that you
do going inward from outer corner to
inner corner that will really help your
concealer not crease throughout the day
then using Mac prep and prime
highlighter and light boost I'm just
going to quickly highlight some other
areas of the face to help balance out
that highlight underneath the eye area
this is a more yellowy base which will
complement my skin tone and I'm just
going to concentrate around the mouth
and in the forehead because sometimes
when you just highlight underneath the
eyes with concealer it can be too much
doing this will actually help it look
more natural believe it or not and kind
of like you're glowing from within then
I'm going to fill in my brows bada boom
right brow done I am using the Anastasia
brow Wiz in ash blonde and then caramel
on the end tail of my brow I will link
my brow brow video down below I'm using
the Anastasia concealer I absolutely
love this concealer for sculpting out my
brows so much I am using a sigma flat
definer brush and I'm just going to
carve it out clean it up so there's
nothing crazy happening on the edges
this will just help my brows look a
little bit more defined if you make any
mistakes filling this filling them in I
can't talk I just woke up this will help
you clean them up so that nothing crazy
is going on around your brows you can
really perfect the shape that you want
using this trick then I'm just going to
set my under eye concealer you can use
any power that you want I am using a
mixture of the Anastasia banana color
powder from her contour kit and I'm also
using Mac Pro emphasize highlighting
it's shaping powder as well the Mac Pro
shaving powder can be found on mac
cosmetics calm you don't have to go to a
pro store to purchase it then I'm just
going to set my t-zone as well any power
you want I always use a really light
powder and nothing that's going to be
heavy just so my foundation does not
move throughout the day then I'm going
to go in with bobbi brown eyeshadow in
the color toast this is a really
beautiful medium blending shade it is so
smooth it goes on so easy and I am using
an e 40 brush from Sigma to buff this
evenly from inner corner to outer corner
we are not focusing this more on the
inner or outer we want this to be evenly
distributed from inner to outer all over
and as
is leaving your brush you want to move
upward to really help blend it out then
going in with Bobby Brown camel
I used to use these all the time I've
talked about them for months there too
my favorite shadows ever and they are
just so summer appropriate so now using
an e25 brush from Sigma which is just
more of a smaller but yet super fluffy
brush I'm going to get deep in that
crease with this color again inner to
outer corner then go back with the e-40
and just continue to blend blend blend
out this entire shadow situation just
don't forget to blend it is the most
important part if you get frustrated
take a 20 second break and keep blending
because I promise it will pay off then
we're gonna go in with Mac tan pigment
ah one of my favorite pigments of life I
am using an e 55 brush from Sigma at
this moment just to put on the tan
pigment packing it all over the lid all
the way from inner corner to outer
corner but you don't want to go up past
the crease then using mac fix+ which is
just a nice spray water base this is
just going to help intensify our shadow
you can also use eye drops for this that
will do the exact same thing pretty much
it's just going to give us more of a
metallic sheen and a little bit more
sparkly then we're going to go in with
mac pressed pigment in summer honey one
of my favorite products that Mac has are
their pressed pigments they're
absolutely beautiful they are made to
actually be put on bare skin with no
primer that's when they have the most
effect they are also made to be used
with fingers and have the most outcome
so I had to go in with a Mac 242 brush
because the my fingers and the e55
wasn't cutting it this is what was
working I am holding a tissue when I use
my eyes just to catch any fallout since
this is sparkly it will tend to fall you
can go ahead and spray more fix+ on this
if you want or not the camera is not
picking up how truly shimmery and
beautiful and glistening this is but it
is absolutely gorgeous it's just like
the icing on the cake
then curling my lashes I'm not going to
curl them too intensely because I am
going with false lashes so when curling
your lashes you typically don't want to
curl the very base you want to curl kind
of in the middle just super slightly and
then go in with any mascara you don't
have to be super picky because you are
going to cover it up with lashes I
always like to choose a volumizing
Scarah for this though because I think
it looks the best with false lashes on
top then going in with SC Ito lashes
this is the wala lash I will link them
down below these are nice and long and
wispy they're absolutely beautiful and I
am just going to pop this on my lash
line and make sure that it is super
super tight to my natural lashes with a
pair of tweezers I squeeze my natural
lashes and my false lashes this is when
the tweezers really really come in handy
especially when you're not applying
eyeliner because it really ensures that
you're not going to have any gaps then
I'm going in with the Becca shimmering
skin Perfector in the sheet opal aka
best highlighter of life I'm going to
use this highlighter to just highlight
the brow bone I didn't want a super
intense highlight with this really
pretty pinky beige e color going on the
eyes so it's beautiful highlighter then
we're going in with makeup geek cocoa
bear and we are going to pop this
underneath the lash line using any brush
that you prefer again this is a sigma
definer brush it's the same brush that I
used to sculpt out my brows I just have
a different one for under my lash line
then going back in with Bobby Brown
toast I'm going to blend that out again
this is where blending is key just blend
blend blend blend blend don't stop so
many people have issues with their under
eye area don't be afraid to blend just
go back and forth back and forth you can
honestly sit down here for an entire
minute just blend then I'm going in with
Mac chroma graphic pencil I believe this
is in shade and w20 I will link it down
below for you guys though of course I'm
going to line my lashline I actually
like this one better right now as
opposed to the NARS Rou bonaparte which
I've mentioned recently it just really
stays on forever
then going in with mac gigablack lash I
just kind of touch that inner corner of
my natural lashes because this will help
pull together the false lashes and make
them look more natural just getting that
inner corner then coating in my bottom
lashes of course as always I really take
my time doing this after I've applied a
cream color liner to my waterline
because some of that cream color liner
will get on your lashes so I take my
time covering that up on my lashes so
they're all black then going in with Mac
care blend press powder in the shade
dark you guys can see how absolutely
beautiful this applies I'm using a big
fat powder brush any powder brush will
do the trick of your choice look at how
gorgeous that bronzer is are you kidding
me it literally looks like skin it is
the most beautiful color in the world
now this is a powder but I use it as a
bronzer so I'm going to bronze the
entire cheek area forehead area I'm not
going to bring it too low on the
forehead area or that can make us feel
kind of squished and angry so try to
keep it up in the higher points of the
forehead just all around the face I
typically don't bronze the center of my
face I just don't care for the way it
looks I bronze the neck area the chin
area in the outer corners of the face
then going in with Becca
wild honey blush one of my favorite
blushes of life right now it almost
looks like a bronzer but with some peach
tones in it it is so summer appropriate
it is absolutely gorgeous you could just
do this as a blush and skip bronzer and
it would still be absolutely beautiful
I'm using a 1:29 short handle brush by
Mac it's just my holy grail brush I use
it for I think six years at this point
it's just one of those oldies then I'm
going in with Laura Mercier peach mosaic
this is a beautiful highlighter but it's
not something that you want to just put
on the cheekbones you want to apply over
the blush as a highlight so beautiful it
just emphasizes look we have going on
matches the eyes amazingly then last but
not least going in with lime crime
lipstick in Coquette
one of my favorite lipsticks of all time
it's such a gorgeous nude peachy pink it
is right on the money so complimentary
to this eye and face book that we have
going on and then just to seal a deal
I'm going to coat my lashes with a clear
brow gel my absolute favorite is
Anastasia Beverly Hills clear brow gel
it doesn't hold a candle to all the
other ones it is amazing it keeps your
brows in place all day go ahead and seal
the deal with Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray or any makeup setting
spray of your choice I'm going to take a
quick bath in this so that everything
looks nice and natural and glowy we are
completely done I hope you guys enjoy
