take about 10 to 15 minutes just to
snuggle with both of my boys before I
get out of bed and start my day first
thing I do when I get out of bed is head
to the bathroom you know brush my teeth
wash my face those things that we all do
in the morning well those things that we
should all do in the morning
I take Georgie on a walk first thing
every morning so that he can of course
go to the bathroom
get out some energy and we can enjoy
some fresh air and the moment the
Georgie lives for getting a treat now
I'm going to make myself a cup of tea I
am NOT a caffeine drinker so instead I
make myself peppermint tea in the
morning because I love the way
peppermint tastes it's so refreshing and
it makes me feel so revitalized I take
some time every morning to get on the
computer see what's poppin on social
media respond to your comments on
YouTube hang out with you on Twitter of
course check my emails as well
you
I just wasn't that hungry this morning I
usually love a big breakfast but today
I'm just having some watermelon and a
kind bar and I am eating outside on my
patio because it was a beautiful day and
I love any chance to get to be outside
with the fresh air and the sunshine
oh look at the little cuddle bear now
it's time for the thumb part hair and
makeup
whether I decide to go more glamorous or
much more natural on a day to day basis
I usually do something that's more
neutral in tone
I swear 90% of my life is spent blending
you
you
since I took a shower late last night
and my hair is clean I'm gonna go in
with a 25 millimeter curling wand from
Bellamy and my hair will literally hold
this curl for two to three days this is
by far the best curling wand I have ever
used I don't know what it is about it
but it's just amazed balls
all done with hair makeup time to get
dressed and be on our way
thanks so much for watching and make
sure you thumb this video up if you
would like to see a nighttime routine
bye guys
is he seriously digging in your asteroid
well I don't want people being like day
talking got bootay Kurt's not unusual of
very well and in actuality this is what
Georgie is doing depression we're done
come on come on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
