today's video I'm going to be doing my
full coverage current foundation routine
to achieve a very flawless finish yet an
intense glow from within without being
dewy without being sticky and without
being too matte long story short I'm
gonna show you guys how to go from this
to this I know right it's a lot grab
your tools and let's get started okay
let me clip my hair back then put this
down I'm trying really hard not to put
my hair up into a bun anymore or a
really tight ponytail because I've had
so much breakage in my hair because I
pull it back so often it's like all
these pieces in the front I'm not gonna
pull them up but they're so broken so my
hairstylist told me that I have to start
like clipping my hair back and keeping
the hair follicle like Flast down
instead like pulling it up and back so
that's why I'm trying to like clip it
like this even though it's not a good
look for me
I'm looking more and more like my third
grade class photo and I'm not proud of
that so the first and I personally think
the most important step in prepping your
skin for a flawless base is what comes
before you ever even touch your makeup
on your skin which is your skincare
routine and your exfoliation process
your makeup is only gonna look as good
as what's underneath and I hate to say
that and it sucks ass because it's the
cold hard truth but even if you have
acneic skin even if you're extremely
oily even if you're extremely dry you
still have to make sure that you're
prepping your skin to the best that you
possibly can because there's nothing
worse than trying to apply a powder
product a cream product a liquid product
it doesn't matter what it is to dry
flaky patchy skin so just make sure that
you are drinking lots of water using
your serums using your moisturizers and
exfoliating as often as possible
everybody's skin is different so I'm not
gonna recommend how many times a week
that you should personally be
exfoliating but I personally exploit in
my skin four days a week that's what
works best for me that's what keeps my
skin nice and smooth it keeps my tone
looking pretty well it keeps the way the
texture and the bumps I really need to
drink water
I'm not hydrated right now I need to
practice what I preach and get it
together so first thing first is I'm
gonna prep my skin this is so damn
important and if you are an OG
subscriber of mine you're probably
laughing as we all do because I used to
not believe in primers and I used to sit
around
just be like oh my god primer sighs now
let's get back I think it's such a
gimmick but now I'm all about primers
but I have to say not necessarily
something that's sold in a bottle that
says face primer I'm just about prepping
the skin so even if that means spraying
on some fix+ on the skin or using a
really great serum or a great
moisturizer there's all different ways
of prepping the skin just make sure that
your skin has a little bit of tackiness
to it or if you're oily you're gonna
want to put on something for oil
prevention before going in with your
foundation just make sure that it lasts
the longest and it's gonna not take up
and it's not going to crack throughout
the day so now for my foundation I'm
gonna start off by going in with the
hourglass vanish stick foundation this
is one of my favorite foundations ever
and it's where I've been using for the
past couple of months along with the duo
are foundation I'm gonna put on shortly
I'm gonna be putting on several
different colors but this is not
necessary for you guys to do at all it's
just right now I am kind of a very
strange in-between shade where I'm not
really like perfectly matching any one
color so I'm just kind of mixing a bunch
of them but please don't try this at
home
I know you're probably like what the
hell are you doing with that color right
there but just just trust me now this
might look like a lot of foundation but
if I blended this out I would get an
extremely sheer coverage and I ain't
going for sheer coverage I'm going for
full coverage okay so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna grab the door forever
foundation in the shade 21 this is I
usually like my go-to shade unless I'm
really fair than I am shade 10 I'm gonna
pump this on the back of my hand
just a few dots right there I'm gonna
grab my damp Beauty sponge any beauty
sponges if you love the most will do you
can use a Beauty Blender a lot of people
have Beauty blenders mine is the
highlight something-something sponge buy
more feet I don't know it looks like
this it's my favorite and then the most
important part in this routine for me is
grabbing a luminous spray so I will use
the touch of dewy luminous skin miss the
majority of the time or I will use the
mac fix+ or I will use the UM Lyla be a
glow face mist which is in my purse out
there in the kitchen so for today I'm
gonna use the tatcha what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna spray this flat side of the
beauty sponge right like this and get
that nice and wet I'm gonna just dab
that on the back of my hand and pick up
that product like that and I'm gonna go
into my face I'm gonna begin to just
pounce all over my skin and blend this
all together this is my absolute
favorite part of my entire makeup
routine what I'm doing right now I don't
know what it is about taking this flat
side of the sponge and just pressing and
pouncing it into my skin it is the most
satisfying feeling in the entire world I
can do it for hours so I'm just blending
it in this whole portion of the face
so now I'm gonna do the same thing I'm
gonna grab the sponge again I'm going to
put a little bit more of the tatcha
luminous dewy skin this I'm gonna pick
up a little bit more on the back of my
hand and just do the exact same thing to
the side of my face I just love watching
all of that unevenness and all that
redness and hyperpigmentation doesn't
just appear before my eyes it's so good
now I'm gonna go in with my favorite
concealer of all time you already know I
did the Tarte shape tape my shade right
now is light medium but I don't have
light medium I have a light neutral and
then I have medium so I'm just like
mixing those two I'm just a mess with my
shades right now I don't have what I
need so now I'm gonna use the pointy
part of the sponge I'm in do the exact
same thing I'm gonna just spray the tip
with that luminous dewy skin mist and
I'm just going to bounce that into the
under eye area I am gonna put this on my
actual eyelid that's how I prime my eyes
if you guys feel like concealer doesn't
work for you of course you can use any
eye primer you want but this is what has
worked for me for years and I just set
my eyes with powder and I'm good to go I
feel like it gives me the best eyeshadow
primer out of anything I've ever tried
okay we're gonna take that lighter shade
and we're gonna put it right there on
the chin right there on the Cupid's bow
I'm gonna put it right around I knows it
I'm gonna put on my actual nose I'm
gonna put it up here in the center I
feel like this is something I will never
stop doing highlighting the center of my
face
it just makes such a difference in your
face when you get to the end product it
just brings so much dimension and it
just really gives you that like like
sharp like Hollywood like Megan Fox look
you know I'm saying you know what I'm
saying I'm gonna make sure I really get
into the crevices of my nose because I
hate that one like you don't have the
time to blend everything out perfectly
and then you look at yourself in the
daylight and you have like foundation
built up around the little cracks of
your nose so make sure you get in there
with the pointy side my botox is like
 holy ly worn off on my forehead
pretty much and honey
I'm trying not to move my face around
too much because the wrinkles are real I
swear I have the wrinkles of like an 80
year old I have made way too many
expressions in my lifetime so now I am
100% done with all the creams and
liquids I'm gonna be using on my face so
it is time to move on to powder so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in with
these Charlotte Tilbury flawless finish
airbrush powder and shade number two
right here and I'm also going to be
combining that with the Lancome absolute
powder this is the radiant smoothing
powder right here and this is in the
shade absolute Pech it is the lightest
shade right here as you can see it is
much lighter than my skin but I will
show you how I use it so that doesn't
make me look like a ghost so we are no
longer going to be spraying our Beauty
sponge now that we are using powders
because it will just like go in and ruin
your powder and create like yucky gunk
on the top and it just won't work so
just use the side that is now damped but
don't spray any extra skin sprays on it
at this point I'm just gonna take that
side of the beauty sponge and just go
right in and you can see how much it
picks up right off the bat it picks up
the generous amount and then I'm going
to kind of tap off the excess like that
and I'm gonna begin just to press it
into my skin very lightly because I
don't want to make myself like matte as
can be so we're gonna really really
lightly press this into the skin once
again we are always patting and we are
always kind of rolling and just meshing
it into the skin and pouncing that
beauty sponge we never want to wipe or
drag otherwise you're just gonna take
off the work that you did for my
under-eye I'm going to go in with the
Kat Von D shade + light contour palette
this is one of my favorite palettes ever
for the under eye and for contouring I
can't talk for contouring as well I'm
gonna go with this first shade right
here you can see is very loved I'm just
going to dab that lightly on my under
eye bring it down along the side of my
nose and up towards my temple
okay so I'm gonna go do my brows and my
eyeshadow really quick and I'll be back
to show you the rest of the face okay so
now that my eyes are done I'm going to
now go in with the Lancome absolute
powder and the reason that I wait to do
this until after my eye shadow is done
is because I feel like it is like the
perfect finish to give that like inner
beautiful radiant glow and I don't like
to do it until after my eyes are done
because otherwise I'm gonna be touching
my skin when I'm putting on my lashes
I'm gonna be using the transfer some
powder to catch the fallout and it's
gonna kind of mess up my base a little
bit so I always wait to do this until
after the eyes are completely done
before I go on bronzer and blush and
highlight I'm gonna take my damp Beauty
sponge and I'm going to dip it right in
there and I have this amount of powder
on my sponge I'm gonna top it off a
little bit so that we don't have too
much and then I'm going to begin to
lightly press this into the skin first
is gonna kind of look like a beard
because it is pretty light shade but the
more I press it in the more it kind of
melt into my skin and doesn't give that
white cast it just becomes a beautiful
radiant powder like I want you guys to
really see how much this transforms my
skin god it's so beautiful every single
time I apply this powder I'm just like
so thankful that Lancome created it in
the first place cuz it's so gorgeous now
if you don't want an Oliver highlight
like I do because I go extreme
definitely you could just put this on
the cheek area just in here and you
could do blush and highlight over top of
it and put on the apples of your cheeks
and it'll just give like that really
beautiful glow from within just your
cheek area but I just love putting it on
my entire face because because this is
me now for bronzer I'm gonna go in with
mac cosmetics mineralized skinfinish in
the shade give me a son we're gonna use
this to warm up the face
I'm gonna do a little blush because I
don't think I can live without blush I
know a lot of people kind of gave up
blush in 2017 but I love it I think it
brings so much life to the face and it's
so necessary for me so now for highlight
I'm gonna go in with the NARS
highlighting and bronzing palette right
here I'm gonna pick up the first two
shades in the palette and I'm going to
be using the same damp Beauty sponge
again the highlight is gonna look like
this sitting on the sponge and then
again I always tap off a little bit the
excess so it doesn't go on too intense
and then I'm going to just dab that and
pounce that into the skin if you want
the smoothest highlight in the world use
it your beauty sponge to apply it it
makes such a difference like a long time
ago I used to apply my highlight and
then afterwards I would go over and kind
of dab it with a sponge but actually
initially going in and apply it with a
sponge is just like a game-changer okay
so now that the look is complete the
very last step that is an absolute must
for me is setting the face with a
setting spray I recently have been in
love with Delilah be setting spray it
makes your face super super glowy so if
your oily you'll probably hate this
because it's kind of like oil in a
bottle it just makes you look like you
have like that fresh glisten like you
just got done running on the beach I
don't know I'm obsessed with it but I
love to look like wet and sweaty the
sound still weird actually coming out of
my mouth but it's the truth
and when your face is wet with setting
spray try as hard as you can not to move
your face not to look around not to make
any facial expressions because right now
if I were like lift up my eyebrows
really high
I would cause wrinkles in my forehead
and since it is damp from the setting
spray it will leave that indention in my
makeup and it'll be there all day long
so try not to move your face when you're
setting spray is drying I'm also gonna
use some morphe preppers that because
i'm just that bitch
all right you guys so that completes my
current go to full coverage inner glow
radiance foundation routine maybe that's
what I'll call it well I will say that
today I applied too much of that Lancome
absolute powder I got a little
heavy-handed but I think I was just so
excited and so horny to show you guys
like how beautiful why is that I'll just
like and then I looked in the mirror
took a step back and I was like oh my
god typically I have a much lighter hand
when applying that powder but you know
what sometimes a ho has just got to glow
but it's a really good lesson to learn
because all of us at some point get too
heavy-handed with our powders and at the
end of the day the best thing that you
can do to save your ass is getting a
good makeup setting spray because once
you spray your face that powder and the
foundation the concealer and the blush
and the highlight and the bronzer it all
just kind of like melts together and
starts to look so natural and just
buttery on the face oh that sentence
just naming like a little hard I don't
know I just my new word is like melt
like I just love the idea of makeup
melting into my skin I'm like huh okay
