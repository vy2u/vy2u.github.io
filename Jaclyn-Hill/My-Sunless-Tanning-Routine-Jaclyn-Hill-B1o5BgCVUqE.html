you step-by-step through my sunless
tanning routine I'm going to show you
exactly what I use and how I achieve a
natural blended smooth looking tan so
let's get started the first thing you're
going to want to do before you self tan
every time are three steps and that a
shower shave and exfoliate yay working
at a tanning salon as a teenager has
finally paid off these are the things I
learned I always using a loofah when
washing my body in the shower because
this will help to gently exfoliate this
is not a harsh exfoliator it's very mild
but it still helps and it's still
important
shaving also acts as an exfoliator but
more importantly it's going to remove
any hair that you have
so the sunless tanner is not going to
stick to every single little hair
particle and you will literally have
little tiny dots all over your legs from
each individual hair it's kind of weird
but I've done it before and I don't
recommend it now I'm going to be going
in with turbinado sugar yes straight
pure sugar and I'm going to be using
this to exfoliate my entire body if
you're going to use sugar i really
suggest the turbinado sugar because it
is honestly the best for exfoliating
your body and I love it because I don't
have to go out and spend tons of money
on an exfoliator and it just works so
well I will use this on my entire body
including my face it doesn't give me any
sensitivity and it really works so now
that we are done with that we can move
on do not moisturize in between
showering and sunless tanning because
that is very important so with dry skin
I'm going to be going in and using
loving tan 2 hour Express in the shade
dark
I've raved about this I absolutely love
it because you only leave it on for two
hours and it just looks so natural and
it's easy to blend then this is random I
know but this is a lifesaver I'm gonna
go in with this morphe synthetic haired
brush I don't know the number of it so I
will link it down below for you guys cuz
I'm not sure of it right now this is
going to be your lifesaver when it comes
to blending in sunless tan so I always
start with my face I do not recommend
always using anything less tanner on
your face test it out on a patch to see
if it works for you or if you have a
reaction but loving tan does not give me
any sensitivity it doesn't break me out
nothing it works beautifully on my skin
so I trust it after I have tested it out
so I'm going to blend this all around my
face and I always do my upper lip and my
eye area last because I don't want those
to pick up too much pigment otherwise it
can look not cute
now I'm
going to go in with another little trick
and this is using any sort of body
lotion or body butter this is the
blissful body body butter it's my
favorite so that is what I'm using
you're going to want to take this and
put it all over your entire hands very
generously including your wrists both
front and back
also the heels of your feet your entire
foot and your ankles you can also do
your kneecaps and your elbows that is
going to help so much with the blending
process and you won't have blotchy hands
like you can easily get sometimes so
using a mitt the loving Tam it works but
they're the saint-tropez is one
saint-tropez I'm sorry is better I think
in my personal opinion but I still use
this one it works
side on your hand and just start
blending when I get to the wrist as you
can see I will pull out my handy dandy
brush that will completely change my
life and make it so much easier to blend
out and you can see the difference what
I love about this specific loving tan to
our product is if it looks blotchy as
you're applying it it won't look blotchy
when you shower off so you really don't
have to worry about making it look
absolutely perfect just blend it as good
as you can and if you still have some
blotchiness or some evenness it's fine
when you shower it'll all look good I
love that aspect of this I always use
the synthetic brush to do my neck in my
chest just because I think that it comes
looking so much more even in the end as
opposed to going in with the mitt so you
can see we're just looking on point so
now moving on to the legs I'm going to
take that body butter and just rub it
all over my entire foot especially
focusing on my ankles because that's
such a difficult place to blend sunless
tanner and have it not look blotchy and
keep it looking natural so I will use
about three to four generous pumps and
put it directly on the glove and then
begin to just massage that on the entire
leg starting at my calf and going all
the way upward and down towards the
ankle once I have reached the ankle and
the foot area I will take a half a pump
and put it directly on my brush then
begin to blend putting in that body
butter or lotion there first is going to
help so much in this process because it
acts like a barrier and just helps
everything blend so much easier as
opposed to dry skin it picks up 100% of
the pigment when you put lotion it
doesn't it just helps so much so now
that we are ridiculously dark we are
going to go chill around the house while
this tan develops it is now 5:45 and
we're going to come back and shower in
two hours
I like to spend this time just kind of
hanging out picking at my house
organizing answering emails watching TV
basically anything that allows me not to
leave my house because it doesn't look
the best for the next two hours we're a
little too dark and a little too blotchy
right now I am watching Sex in the City
for oh I don't know the five thousandth
time I've been obsessed with the show
again recently it's one of my top
favorites so that is what I'm doing I'm
also babysitting my mom's dog pixie
right now and Georgie as you can see is
obsessed with her so it's been quite a
fun week now it is 8 o'clock and it is
time to get in the shower I never wait
longer than two hours I'm so antsy to
shower this off because it's just like
laughs it just doesn't look the best if
you leave it on for longer than two
hours you will get darker but I'm more
into that natural kind of glowy tan so I
don't really care so I'm gonna hop in
the shower I am NOT going to use in a
loofah I'm just gonna use my hands and
soap because I don't want to scrub off
any of the tan that we just applied now
I saw this lighting and I was like this
is not okay why do I look like I didn't
get any darker I'm trying to show off
hello the smoothness yes it's working
but I decided to record myself again the
following morning and natural daylight
so you can actually see how this looks
the color payoff the way it's blended so
on and so forth so that completes my
sunless tanning routine I hope that you
guys maybe got some tips or tricks from
this and you enjoy the video thank you
so much for watching as always you guys
I really do appreciate it
I love you and I'll see you soon bye
