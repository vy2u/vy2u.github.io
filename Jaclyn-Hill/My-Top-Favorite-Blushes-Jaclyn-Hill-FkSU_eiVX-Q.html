a video about my top favorite blushes I
don't have like a top five or top ten I
actually have 12 excuse me I'm 12
sitting here in front of me I have been
sick or at least fighting some sort of
bug the past few days my head is killing
me and I'm really a key and my stomach
has been upset so I apologize for this
whole situation my eyes are burning
really bad right now looking at the
light so I'm sorry if I'm a little like
a lot today because I'm just not feeling
like Jaclyn right now um just one last
reminder I am going to be leaving day
after tomorrow
Friday to go to I'm at New York City
again I am so excited you guys have no
idea like I'm nervous for the flight of
course at the mums so excited to see you
guys and I will be at the sigma booth on
Saturday afternoon from 2:00 to 4:00 and
it is booth 834 so I cannot wait to see
you guys I will also be there Friday
night for those of you who are wondering
and I think I will be stopping by for
about an hour on Sunday I will keep you
posted on Twitter so let's get into my
hair blushes by accident a majority of
these blushes are Mac blushes because
map just has one of my all-time favorite
formulas they're just so beautiful and
easy to blend they just look good on
everyone I've never heard anyone
complain about a Mac blush before plus
I've been using matte blushes for
literally 10 years and had to sell them
for four years so I am very comfortable
with them and I just think they're
absolutely beautiful so let's start with
the Mac blushes I want to start with
this blush just because everyone knows
this blush if you don't own it you
should and that is Mac margin I have
this one in a little magnet I bought it
at the store for a palette so the
typical blushes come like this I have it
like this for palate reasons so this is
margin it is an absolute beautiful shade
it has some shimmer in it it gives a
nice natural glow to the skin the
shimmer and this blush is not the
typical shimmer that you will find it is
not chunky shimmer or gritty sure it is
the most finely milled
condensed shimmer you've ever felt in
your life into this blush this blush
just has an all-over beautiful
glistening effect it is so gorgeous in
the spring of summer if you don't want
to do bronzer you can just do this as
your blush and put it all over the cheek
area and oh it is amazing it is
unstoppable I have used this on so many
different clients I think in my
freelance kit I went through two or
three of these in a couple of years it
is just absolutely amaze fest next we
have Mac spring sheen spring she kind of
reminds me of NARS orgasm but on
steroids it has a little bit more of an
orgy coral undertone but again it's a
completely shimmer blush so it's not
matte specks of shimmer it is a true
shimmer with lots of glisten and shine
it is again absolutely beautiful it
gives a really nice golden almost
yellowish Sheen to the skin so this one
will really complement people who have
more olive undertone a little bit more
tan complexion if you're super super
fair and tend to burn easy
I would probably shy away from spray
Sheen it might not be your favorite but
on anyone who has a slight glow or
yellow undertones at all of all of
complexion this is just on point Mac
Melba this again is such a popular blush
if you do not own this you definitely
should this is an all matte shade and
unlike some matte blushes that are very
difficult and chalky when blending Mac
their matte shades are so easy and truly
creamy even though it's matte and they
just blend so beautifully this is the
perfect rosy peach color it really looks
good on pretty much everyone when I was
freelancing if I wasn't going to put
margin on someone I would typically put
Melba on someone because this is a matte
shade it's almost getting that version
of margins so something that's a little
bit more mature and skin this will look
good on a huge range of people and skin
tones so I highly highly recommend Melba
if you do not own a good matte blush for
everyday go get Melba in your life Mac
peaches this is one of my all-time
favorite blushes period it is absolutely
gorgeous on Sony for people when you go
into in
counter map store and you look at it
sitting there on the display it's kind
of intimidating because it does look
quite orange and peachy compared to the
other blushes when I worked at max so
many people would be like you're putting
that on me and I'm like just wait and
once you put it on and blend it out
everybody wants to go home with it
everybody is going to buy it because it
is so pretty on the skin it gives such a
beautiful glow from within even though
it is in that shade it is amazing so if
you do not have an issue with peach this
is your blush next is style this is a
very beautiful blush and again when
you're looking at it it can kind of seem
like I'm going to put that on my face
because it is definitely an orange color
when looking at it when it applies to
the cheeks is a beautiful yellow gold
color that has an orange undertone in it
this is absolutely beautiful over top of
a light wash of bronzer on the cheek
area it just really looks like again you
are glowing from within I'm going to say
that pretty much about every single
blush because that's what I always go
for is a youthful glow so a lot of these
are going to really emphasize just that
nice natural healthy glow I'm a talking
shimmer and dewy but a nice glow so this
is just absolutely gorgeous especially
if you have a tan or you are naturally
yellow or all of complexion o style is
amazing this is a mac prolongwear blush
there Pro Longwear blushes are
absolutely gorgeous and they truly do
stay on for a very very long time they
are supposed to be a 12 hour wear if you
are super oily I would try out the Mac
Pro Longwear line because it is truly
gorgeous and again the matte shades have
tons of pigment and blend absolutely
beautifully this specific one is rosy
outlook I think it is such a different
shade it is a rose with pink in it so
it's like a baby pink and a rose
combined them to this perfect perfect
wash of color it is so pretty and you
can go super intense and make it
pigmented or you can put a light washing
it on either way it stays on for hours
and hours and hours it does not move
whatsoever is actually gorgeous if
someone walked into the mat counter and
said I own nothing from Mac I would
usually go to this one first because it
looks good on so many different people
and it stays on forever so rosy outlook
last blush from Mac is Sun bask this is
the perfect summer blush it's absolutely
gorgeous it's pretty much a bronzer with
sharp and a little bit of glitter in it
now when I say glitter don't be scared
because I cannot stand glitter on my
cheeks I only like glitter on my eyes
but this does not come off glittery on
the cheeks whatsoever in the summer time
I will do a little bit of foundation or
like tinted moisturizer and just put
this on the cheeks and done good to go
it is just absolutely beautiful
the amount of shimmer is perfect they
put in here it really truly looks good
on everybody extremely dark complexions
can wear this blush as well so Mac some
baths if you're looking for a summertime
blush this is your guy my favorite
drugstore blush of all time and my
personal opinion it's kind of hard to
find drugstore blushes this one is just
oh it is Milani Luminoso this is my
ride-or-die it is actually amazing and
for the price off the wall if the
packaging was Giorgio Armani I would be
completely fooled and convinced that
this was a high-end product it is
beautiful it is a baked blush it goes on
so amazingly so creamy it's similar to
NARS orgasm but I actually like this one
better it's a little bit lighter in
shade the NARS orgasm I'm referring to
blush because it's been such a popular
blush for so many years I know a lot of
you guys are familiar with it this one
is a little bit lighter and shade and it
almost doubles as a highlighter if you
bring up high enough on the cheekbones
you will get that beautiful
because it is the perfect amount of
depth without being too dark or too
light gorgeous
peachy pinky goldie shape yet new fair
girls out there who have pink undertones
can still rock this absolutely amazing
Milani Luminoso my next blush is by
Tarte the Amazonian clay collection is a
beautiful beautiful collection these are
12 hour blushes I truly think that the
matte blushes last longer than these do
but I still really like these and I
really really love the color blissful I
think that it is a different color it
has a gorgeous amount of pink and rose
there is pretty much no peach in this
one it is very pinky and very rosy at
the same time it is just a beautiful
color again going to look at on so many
different people the nice thing about
this blush is you can get tons of
pigment or you can get a light sheer
wash depending how you apply absolutely
amazing and this again since it is all
matte will complement more mature skin I
have been wearing this next blush to
death for the past month I can not stop
and it is the Becca wild honey oh this
blush is absolutely gorgeous the formula
of this blush is off the chain it is not
a matte and it is not a shimmer I am
calling it a sheen because it is not
either it is the best of both worlds it
is actually beautiful it's pretty much
the color of a bronzer with a like dash
of peach in there it is just it's
gorgeous I've worn this with a contour
eye once with bronzer and I want it by
itself on my cheeks I actually love it
it's so creamy it is so blendable it is
so buttery I cannot either in Utah I'm
excited about this blush it is
ridiculous I'm just right now Oh Becca
wild honey I can't get enough I cracked
it through the day it broke and I was
like oh but it's okay I got it
that's all good I am in love with these
Clinique cheek pump the whole collection
but plum pop in particular is such a
beautiful color once again like the
Becca blush this is not a shimmer nor is
it a matte it is what I call
and it is absolutely gorgeous the way
this applies is so beautiful it truly
looks just like a natural glow there's
no share but yet it's not completing
that it is absolutely gorgeous and it
has a beautiful purple undertone in this
pink it is just on point for spring so
so so gorgeous and I'm really really in
love with these clinic colors like in
general I want them to come out with
tons more colors in this cheek pop
collection I really hope they do because
I love this whole collection and I am
NOT a funny girl last but not least is
NARS deep throat this is such a
beautiful shade regardless of the name
it is the perfect rosy pink color with
little tiny flecks of gold shimmer in it
which again do not come on chunky or
glittery on the cheeks otherwise I would
not be talking about it it is just the
most beautiful rosy pink color and it
has so much pigment it is crazy so this
one is definitely going to be a little
bit more pop on the cheek area this is
not a light wash by any means this is a
pigmented blush with gold rosy
undertones and it's just absolute
beautiful on so many people gorgeous
shade for summertime NARS deep throat
