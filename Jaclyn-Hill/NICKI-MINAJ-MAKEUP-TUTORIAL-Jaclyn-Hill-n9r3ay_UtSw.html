tutorial now obviously today is not
about glamour makeup but fun crazy
insane makeup it may be a little ugly
but that's okay so I'm taking max color
and orange the name of it is literally
called orange and it is a bright orange
I am buffing this from inner to outer
corner all over the place I'm not
keeping this on outer edge like I do
sometimes I'm not doing any type of cat
eye with this I want all the colors to
be going strictly from the bottom of my
lash line up to the brow area I want
this to be really buffed out and really
colorful so I'm just dusting that back
and forth pack on as much as you want
also I have to warn you that my skin in
this video was having a horrible
irritation I put on Laura Mercier's
illuminating a tinted moisturizer that's
what it was and my skin had a horrible
reaction to it and I was in recovery so
I've got bumps everywhere anyways now
this is Mac's rule which is just a
lighter color of orange um in person it
is a much different color than the
orange shade I use it's a lot lighter I
use rule a lot I use it in everyday
makeup on myself all the time I use just
a tiny bit of it and I just buff it into
my crease with or whatever I'm wearing
because I think it's such a gorgeous
color especially when you don't use it
like overdone when you just put a tiny
bit on and just add it in like the outer
corner such a pretty color anyway so
next I'm taking Mac's pigment this is in
bright fuchsia if you're not familiar
with pigments they're just a loose
powder that can be used for anything on
the face or body they can be used for
blushes eyeshadows lips you can mix them
in with clear nail polish and make your
own nail polish shades it's just loose
powder and it will last you a lifetime
one of these matte pigments will
literally if you use it every single day
I bet it would last you two years I have
a pigment that for I think two or three
years of my life I live
use it as a highlight on my cheeks every
single day it's called melon and I'm
still not even half done with it it's
insane these things just they're so
condensed ago when you think you're done
with it and you shake it up and you
reopen it again it's full to the top
it's like never ending anyways so I'm
just pulling my eyelid taunt because I
don't want any like creases in this I
want it to be really evenly smooth all
over the lid so I pull my eyelid like
gently as I can I pull it taut and then
I just wipe it all over the lid up to
that orange color turning my brush
sideways to kind of blend it in to that
orange manually with my little my little
shader brush but then I'll go back and
I'll continue to blend the pink and the
orange together as of right now I'm just
packing on that pink to get it as
vibrant as possible and then I'm going
to go back a second time with rule which
is the mid-tone that I used you can go
back with rule or orange it doesn't
matter I just going back with rule to
blend in those two together and putting
wool on top of orange is going to make
it more vibrant and vivid so I'm using
the Mac two to two brush I'm using this
to blend this back and forth it's a
great blending brush it's a lot like the
217 but it's a little bit longer in
length so it gets a little bit more
precise into those areas I only had that
tiny clip of me applying eyeliner I'm
sorry and then I'm using Mac oh I'm
sorry no I'm not I'm using Laura Mercier
foundation and L'Oreal Lumi foundation
they are my favorites right now if you
didn't see my last video I mentioned
both of them I love them so I'm just
taking the two combined I put just a
little bit of each on the back of my
hand and then I'm using the Sigma f80
brush to buff this all in um I will have
a link below to Sigma comm and also I
will have a discount code for you guys
for 10% off if you want to go there um
I'm not affiliated with them or anyway
or anything like that I just saw that
they're having a code right now so I
thought I would share it with you guys
I've been like the last couple of videos
just in case you want to save some money
on these awesome brushes so I'm using
Mac's cork to fill in my brows and I'm
going to do this pretty generously
because Nicki Minaj always has insane
brows and saying everything let's be
honest so I'm just going to fill them in
I'm using a two one two brush by Mac
which is just a really stiff dense
short precise brush that you can really
get in on your brows then I'm going to
use Mac's mylar which is not a shimmery
eyeshadow it's a satin I believe so it's
just going to add that white highlight
but it's not going to be really shimmery
now obviously Nicki Minaj you can add a
really shimmery highlight and it would
still be fine
but I did not feel like going at that
insane so I added more of a matte tone
highlight because I thought the eyes
were already you know a little full of
attention what do you guys think I think
my eyes already have enough happening on
there not to mention I'm going to do
even more I'm just going over that same
area just to kind of buff it out so
there's no harsh line after applying the
highlight then I'm applying my concealer
I'm using Mac Pro Longwear concealer in
shade nw20 I'm going to do a highlight
today underneath the eye I normally do
that anyways I'm gonna try to make it
pretty light though because Nicki Minaj
always has a very very white highlight
under her eye especially when she's
doing looks like this the highlight
under her eye is like beaming so I'm
going to use this highlight powder it's
by Mac Pro I've showed it before and it
is called accentuate I'm just gonna use
a brush that is actually discontinued by
Mac which is really sad because they
don't have anything like it and it's
awesome
but um Sigma has one and I think it's
called the highlighter brush and I just
ordered a new one because I can't find
mine and I love that for setting the
under-eye powder under-eye concealer I
mean with powder I'm taking Mac's hepcat
such a gorgeous color to mix between
purple and pink in all the right ways
it's amazing I'm going to use that same
brush to use for my eyebrows the two one
two I'm going to buff it from inter
count corner all the way to outer corner
normally I don't bring it all the way in
I kind of like buff it out a little bit
in the inner corner but I'm going to
make it just as vivid in the inner
corner as I did in the outer corner and
then I'm just using any pencil brush I
think this one is from Sedona lace and
I'm just going to use that to buff it
out with no additional product on it and
then I will go back a second time after
I've buffed out the harsh lines and just
put another layer right on that line my
lash line just too tight line even more
and I'll show you the exact same thing
on the other eye that I do I put on the
product and then I buff it out and then
I put another layer of the hepcat
because this will really give a lot of
dimension
that lower lashline and make it pop and
be smoky at the same time I'm using the
ever-so-popular
red cherry lashes at number 43 I can't
get away from them I know I'm sorry some
people were saying that they ordered
them and they were too big for their
eyes in their face and I'm really sorry
they're not working on you like they do
for me you know everyone has their
lashes of choice and these just fit my
face most of the time so I'm going to
use benefit hoola bronzer I'm dusting it
all over my face another Sedona lace
brush I mentioned it in my favorite
video but I got dyslexic and mixed the
numbers up for you guys but I show you a
picture of it so you can see what it is
I'm just using this to dust hoola all
over my face I'm not trying to contour
anyway not going to put the bronzer on
the inner part of my face either just
concentrating it all around the outer
corner my face and then I'm going to
just put some mascara on the bottom
lashes I'm using Maybelline's once again
I forgot what it's called the x
extensions I don't know okay stars and
rockets again by Mac this is just an
additional step but it's just got a lot
of like pink iridescent in it and I'm
just gonna pop it in my inner corner
just to give more attention to that
inner corner I don't know if I showed it
or if I'm going crazy but I did put a
highlight in my inner corner as well I
think I use Mac's nylon I don't know if
I showed that I don't know what okay
anyways I'm using pink swoon blush by
Mac this is a good all Mac tutorial
apparently I'd even realized that but
what can I say Mac has great
pigmentation and if you're trying to
rock Nicki Minaj you can definitely use
Mac also I am sorry for my hair
obviously you can tell that I rolled out
of bed and was like tutorial anyways I'm
using another Sedona lace blush brush
I had it nearest to me and I'm just
putting this all over the cheeks and
then I'm going to use Mac's soft and
gentle as a highlight I wanted a true
like silvery whitish highlight I didn't
want any gold on my cheeks at this point
because that would kind of clash with
the baby pink I have on my cheeks and
the light pinks and cool tones I have on
my eyes I do have warm tones as well but
I just thought that the light tone would
look better just doesn't surround for a
lot of highlight like Nicki always does
now this is actually the part of the
video that I base the entire look around
Nicki Minaj came out with her second
but glam lipstick and this was the day
that it was launching so as an employee
I really wanted to channel Nicki Minaj
in a way that was fun and different and
not trying to be so pretty all the time
and I figured if I'm going to wear this
lipstick I'm gonna wear it right I'm
gonna have fun with it
there it is introducing oh you can see
I'm like okay going in but it is
lavender beyond lavender cool tone it's
like it's it's a very different color
Nicki Minaj apparently spent like a year
and a half creating this lipstick and
she's very proud of it so I figured that
I would give her the respect and wearing
it to his full capacity without the lip
liner it is seriously just as opaque as
it looks in the tube but I thought that
I'll give myself like a very soft easy
ombre lip with it because I just wanted
to have some fun I knew other girls at
work would be wearing it without lip
liner so I thought I would make it a
little bit different so I'm just taking
that same magenta lip pencil that I
realign my entire mouth with and now I'm
just gonna go around the outer corner
only and this will give you a really
soft ombre effect and then if you just
rub your finger over your lips or you
just kind of rub them together gently it
will smooth it over so there's no harsh
lines and that is it love you guys ma
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
