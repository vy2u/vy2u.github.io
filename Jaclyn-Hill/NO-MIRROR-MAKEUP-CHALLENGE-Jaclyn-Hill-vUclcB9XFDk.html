the no mirror makeup challenge this is
actually the second time I am filming
this if you follow me on snapchat I
talked about how I film this yesterday
the entire thing from beginning to end
and because I couldn't have the
viewfinder because I can't see myself
when I'm doing the no mirror makeup
challenge
I do not realize my camera stopped
recording like 10 minutes towards the
end so I went I imported the footage on
my computer like yeah and I got there
and there was just cut out like in the
middle of me doing my browser so yeah
today I have John behind the camera hey
guys oh he is going to be making sure
the camera record this entire thing and
I say and focus for you the entire times
so and he might be giving some
commentary here in America
not too much commentary okay I'm going
to remove my very dirty mirror everyone
is always asking what makeup mirror I
used to do my makeup by the way it is
like a crap mirror from when I was like
I'm not kidding 16 years old so it's
nothing special it's an oldie but a
goodie ok now I'm gonna turn off the
viewfinder and get started
hand it to John oh this is my job oh god
you are all good to go
am I in focus yes yes so you're gonna
see this proof there's no IV finders off
oh there's nothing there okay I'm gonna
start by parting my face using the
Smashbox primer water I don't know if I
should like talk to you guys that this
is like a tutorial this is so
uncomfortable if I was gone would you be
comfortable no has nothing to do with
you which is in general like not having
anything to look out like a screen or a
mere nothing like you literally just
feel it I'm gonna prime my face for
absolutely no reason I'm not gonna let
this make him stay I was I can promise
you that it now I'm going to go in with
some foundation I'm going to be using
the Bourjois healthy mix serum
foundation don't even know if this is my
color right now and I'm gonna be using
the artiste brush I don't even know what
how I feel like this brush yet to be
honest I don't know if I love it oh I
hate it there are some things I like
about it there's some things I don't
like about it I feel like it pulls at
your skin um but I also feel like it
makes your foundation go such
a long way like the tiniest amount of
foundation can pretty much like cover
your entire face with this I do feel
like it pulls out my skin so I don't
know give me a couple more chances to
use it looks like it's a hairbrush are
you allowed to tell me how it looks
sure I feel like that's breaking rules
is it I think it is if you tell me I
mean I'm gonna be real I think it looks
pretty pretty damn good
it's just foundation nailed it we're
gonna do concealer and this is the only
shade I have right now which is light
neutral so this is going to be really
light conceal the Beast your commentary
is not to appreciate it hold on I don't
know what I'm doing stops how's that
pull are okay I do a line there who if I
look down I can see my face but hey made
me like blend it out like this does it
look like tears of concealer not at all
okay that's not a good sign
all right what's good one this out well
it looks good and I VA looks normal so
okay okay okay if something looks bad I
don't think you should tell me though
because then like no it'll make me feel
like you got to change it yeah but if
it's good I'll tell you you just lie to
me so if it okay hold on
now we're gonna go ahead and set the
face I really think that I forgot a step
like I feel like I'm missing something I
did primer foundation concealer powder
yeah I'm not missing anything I don't
think like honestly this could make
someone like have a panic attack it's
just you feel so we're not looking at
yourself in the mirror oh we wanna put
on my nose ah okay just a little bit of
powder everywhere now I'm gonna go in
with the eyes I'm going to be using the
morphe 35o palette um
I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do
um um feel like you got to stick to what
you know when you're doing the no mirror
makeup challenge like I'm not gonna try
like some avant-garde like a boy that
I've never done before so I'm gonna go
in with this color right here this like
orange II tangerine I don't know I just
feel so confused this is the hard part
like your eyes are you joking okay I got
this I got this come on boo I'm gonna do
a smoky eye today so I'm gonna bring it
all the way into the inner corner and
I'm just gonna do when she'll wear
promotions right so it's like sit here
like this
keep it low oh how did you circular
motions like this and then upper circles
windshield circles just try and like
repeat the motions that I normally do
like hmm now I'm gonna take oh God
pressure
I'm gonna take this color right here and
add a little bit of that in the crease
as well I don't know what I'm doing you
guys just trying to keep it low keep it
low more a little nice and tight right
in there she said just gotta keep
blending like when in doubt just keep
blending nothing bad can happen
I'm glad until your fingers lead
I fear harsh lines like I fear the devil
I'm gonna grab this color right here
I am terrified to go with this dark
shade okay oh god oh god okay this is
gonna be so hard okay oh god oh god
I can tell this is bad I know this is
bad just blending this wait what am i
doing I want us to be in my actual
crease I don't want this to be down
there why'd I do that

how to accomplish this hot mess of an
eye look I'm going to blend everything
out so I have any harsh lines
oh god I think I was one up really high
my crease now I'm going to take this
really beautiful copper shade down here
in the bottom okay I'm going to wet this
with some mist infix because I just want
this to be like metallic I feel like

you kidding I have a lot fall out though
we're going to clear my my that's the
one part oh you know I must say though
the eye shadow is not that bad
I told you the cheeks aren't that bad

say behind the camera leg like that's
not good honey like at all you need to
tell me if you were taking me out to
dinner I just came out with these lips
I'm you take you look amazing good horse
you would know I'm not disgusted by the
lashes my skin looks like it's I don't
know how I actually had the ability to
do that but my skin looks like a nine
year old man hey so here we have the
finished look this wing is everything to
me it was trying to be like a Black Swan
but it just turned into them just metal
miserably this wing is still not a point
but better but the eyeshadow itself not
horrible the cheeks they could be better
the brows the brows are looking a little
bushy but I'm not actually okay with it
I am that completes this no mirror
makeup challenge I hope that you enjoyed
this video I challenge you guys to do
this even if you don't record it just
sit down with your friends and do this
just you guys in your private time
because it is so it's such an experience
any time I've ever watched anyone do
this video I've never understood why
they're acting so like we are
disoriented until I myself try this and
it's just the weirdest sensation in the
entire world not to mention it really
tests how well you know your face and
your artistry so I hope that you guys do
it report back so that's it thank you so
