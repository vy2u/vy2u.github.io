my November favorites and yes I am home
if you can tell by my background and
very quickly before we jump in this
video I just want to say thank you so
much to those of you who left comments
on my most recent facebook status I
posted a status about how I've been
receiving negative comments recently and
just how it's been really hurting my
feelings and I was not expecting the
outpour of love that I receive from you
guys and it really it just means so so
much and I really do feel like I have so
many friends over the internet and
people who really understand me and get
me and I just love you guys so much so
thank you let's jump into this the first
products I've mentioned in my most
recent haul video and they are the bobbi
brown eyeshadows I absolutely love these
shadows I have never heard anybody talk
about Bobbi Brown eyeshadows and they're
definitely underrated because they are
amazing this one right here is champagne
quartz it's just a beautiful all-over
lip color I always always in the market
for a really pretty champagne vanilla
shakes or all over the lid I just love
it
the other one is toast this really
reminds me of makeup geek creme brulee
or Mac Samoa silk don't look at my nails
it's the last one is camel I love this
color it's kind of color of vomit and I
love shades like this I love those
mustardy yellowy Browns I'm wearing all
three of these on my eyes today I have
been wearing constantly together
separately I just I absolutely love
these so go Bobbi Brown your shadows are
awesomesauce
next are lip products these two
lipsticks are from Lime Crime I
absolutely love the formula of Lime
Crime they are very similar to Mac and
they oh my god I just got that
Eldorado's and they smell just like maca
too so I'm assuming that they have
vitamin E in it anyways the two colors
that I have been loving our BAE bets and
Cosmo top Cosmo pop I hadn't heard a lot
about for a very long time and I was
just kind of like it's really super
orange so I never really bought it plus
I only get them online and for shipping
and all that so I thought that's just
too much but then when I saw this color
baby I've never heard anyone talk about
it before and when I saw it online I was
like
hello so it's just a beautiful beautiful
pink it's got a little bit of warm
undertones in it I love it so much
these two mixed together are gorge I'll
put the bay back over top of the Cosmo
pop I love those two together this is
what I was wearing in my collective haul
I had this on a lot of people were
asking where I was wearing a pretty sure
I put in the description bar
but yes baby and Cosmo pop I love these
then this month I got the revlon
colorburst lacquer balm it looks like
this it's one of the shiny ones like
some matte ones came out as well that
looks like this but then they also have
the shining ones I love this color it is
such a basic everyday color I'm usually
not crazy about shimmer or glitter in my
everyday shades but I really really like
this it's so basic it's so pretty it
looks natural natural and moisturizes
your lips and it just gives a nice
little glisten it's really a really
beautiful tip for day to day I can't
fake ever I have been using this blush
by NARS all month along it is called
Gilda it's this gorgeous gorgeous pinky
coral shade and it's hard to call it a
straight coral but it's also hard to
call it like a pink or rows I feel like
it's a pink rose and coral all mixed
together and almost a camera yeah it's
picking it up I absolutely love this
shade so much I feel like this is such a
universal shade that most people can
wear this color it's not something
that's really made for cool tones or
specifically for warm tones I'm wearing
it today I just I absolutely love it so
Gilda by NARS this bronzer has been my
BH I say bitch I got this in the end of
October and this is the only bronzer I
have used to bronze or contour in anyway
and it is the makeup forever bronzer and
number 20 I absolutely love this I've
never heard anybody talk about this
bronzer before on YouTube and I do not
know why because this is amazing it
looks like it's light but then when it
goes on it gives such unnatural
pigmentation it doesn't have too many
orange tones in it not too much red not
too much pink
it's literally like the perfect neutral
bronzer I feel like if everybody would
go out and buy this this would
become like the new hits in the world of
bronzers it's just it's gorgeous
it's absolutely amazing okay I feel like
I'm selling this like crazy right now
but seriously this bronzer is gorgeous
totally random but I have been loving
the beauty blender cleaner this is the
blender cleaner and it's a solid so
basically it just looks like this mine
has like makeup on it from cleaning it
but you literally just get this wet at
the sink
roll your Beauty Blender around in it
and it cleans it spotless it's amazing
but I've actually been using it a lot
just for touch-up cleans on my brushes
so the other night I actually watched
like 30 brushes I got this wet in the
sink and then just took my brushes here
oh just a tiny bit and then it makes
your brushes so clean and it conditions
them I love this and it's so small and
easy it's not like a big freaking jug of
glitter it's so simple to use so I love
this I have really visited makeup geeks
eyeliner this month but this is a mortal
which is the black one and I'm telling
you you can go ahead and try to prove me
wrong you're not gonna find an eyeliner
blacker than this one it is like black
as night it is crazy I actually love it
the formula is so different than
anything you've ever experienced it's
not like a mousse it almost feels like
an ink when it goes on when it goes on
it does not move but it does not move I
have not put it in my waterline but if
you did it's not gonna move it is crazy
like I normally just wash my face at
night and that's it but when I wear this
I have to use a makeup remover first
because it is on like Donkey Kong so I
have been loving and makeup geek
immortal I mentioned these in my
contouring highlighting video these are
the stroke of light by bare minerals
they are just highlighters they are in a
luminous one in the minister to luminous
one is more of a pink based luminous
twos a little more neutral yellow base I
use them both for specific things and I
love them they're very similar to the
Mac prep and prime and like the light
boost and radiant rose just for like
what it actually is meant to do on the
face but I like this one for winter time
because these are much creamier or the
prep and prime if you're very dry it's
gonna make you look more crepey and it's
going to bring more attention to fine
lines I think where these are very very
creamy if you're super oily you'll
probably at the Mac prep and prime
butter I am more dry especially in the
winter time so I have been
being these luminous two right there so
it's more of a neutral shade almost look
like a concealer and then this is number
one which is very pink right there next
to it so luminous to a luminous one I
have been in love with the radiant
creamy concealer by NARS which is crazy
because I am like Pro Longwear concealer
till death I hadn't obsessed with it I
have been literally literally since the
day it came out I worked at Mac when Pro
Longwear came out and I have not
switched it up since I've been obsessed
with it but the radiant creamy concealer
somebody told me back when it first came
out when I was working at Nordstrom that
I needed to try it I tried it one day I
was so just like I don't like it and I'm
not buying it like months ago and then I
had it and then I just kind of kept
going back and back I don't know what my
issue was long story short I ended up
loving it so I have been using this now
for about a month and a half I love it
it really does not crease on me it's
nice and creamy I would say it's a
medium coverage you could definitely
build it to a full I love it it's hard
to find a good concealer and this in my
book is a great one Laura Mercier
highlighter and zero one oh my gosh I
have been obsessed let me just say it's
that time of year I get highlighter
crazy I have mentioned this in a video
before I absolutely love it I don't know
if you can see it I'm literally filling
up my hands with swatches but it is so
beautiful and wearing out on my cheeks
today it is just the most neutral
beautiful highlight it's like there's
not silver or pink or gold in it it's
just highlight it's gorgeous absolute
beautiful once again a product I've
never heard talk about on YouTube get on
it it's amazing totally random but this
is a body wash I have been crazy about
and this is the twisted peppermint
shower gel by Bath and Body Works
literally I've been crazy about it I
wasn't joking I've only had it for three
and a half weeks literally like I'm like
so good I don't know about you guys but
when the holidays come around
I want peppermint and candy cane scented
everything like candles lotion
fragrances soaps
speaking of soaps I had the candy cane
blessed by Bath and Body Works soap and
I honestly like don't even want to use
it that much because it's so good I want
to last forever
while I could go buy more I just I love
peppermint and candy cane stuff this
time of year oh my gosh so much so
relaxing to me so yes amazeballs last
but not least I have to mention my hair
extensions I have been wearing these all
month long and I love them I absolutely
love them they're by the brand Bellamy
and they are 22 inches long you can see
how long they are they come down really
really long I absolutely love them if I
have not already said that I'm just I'm
not a hair girl I trained in makeup I'm
not trained in hair like it's not my
thing I'd go to school for it so for me
to enjoy something hair wise it has to
be quick and easy cuz I'm it's just not
my thing I mean you know I'm just like
that average girl when it comes to hair
these are so easy to manage
they look so natural they feel so
natural that I just I love them so I
know a lot of you guys have asked me to
do a review on them um if you guys want
to take an in-depth video of how I cook
them in and style them and stuff like
that and all my thoughts just let me
