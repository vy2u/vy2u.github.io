very late November favorites so as you
guys know I was away from YouTube for
three weeks after John's episode and
during that time I missed my November
favorites and I didn't really think
anything of it because I was like it's
all good like I'll make up for with my
December favorites but then a couple
days ago I realized like light bulb I'm
not going to be doing a December
favorites because it's gonna be the last
month of the year and in the beginning
of January I will do my best of beauty
which is like my roundup of my very
favorite products from the entire year
and there's a lot of products in this
that won't have like categories in that
video so I figured better than ever I
got to do now so the first thing that I
want to talk about in this video are
sheet masks and skincare in general I
got on snapchat and was showing you guys
my skin and telling you how recently my
skin has been changing so much for the
better and I'm giving the credit to all
the masks I have been using I've been
using a different mask basically every
single day I basically look at my skin
in the mirror like in the morning or at
nighttime and I'm like alright what's
going on here do my pores look large do
i pores look clogged
does my skin texture look uneven am i
dry dude whatever it may be I'll reach
for a mask that will help me with that
thing
and I've been doing that basically
everyday as a part of my skincare
routine and my skin is just so thankful
for it and it's looking the best that it
has in years I think it's funny that I
say that because just yesterday I woke
up with texture on the right side of my
cheek and I'm like no if you don't know
what a sheet mask is it's like that kind
of creepy looking mask where you pick it
up and you put it on your face it's got
holes for your eyes nose and mouth
anyways I want to talk about my top
three and the first one right here is
the egg cream mask and it's by the brand
too-cool-for-school and this one is from
Sephora actually all of them yes all of
them I have purchased from Sephora um
this one right here is the number one
most hydrating sheet mask that I have
personally ever used if you are looking
for deep intense hydration this will be
your best friend I use it this morning
because I woke up and my skin was not
only looking dull but it was looking
like very dry like almost like flaky dry
so I exfoliated and then I put this on
and I mean it cured it I'm telling you
like this will hydrate you so intensely
it's oh it almost leaves your skin
almost sticky that because it's so
intensely hydrating the second one is by
the brand tatcha and it's funny because
I actually can't wear basically any
touch of skin care I've tried so much of
it and I want to love it so bad but the
brand actually breaks me out which is so
sucky but for some reason this mask does
not it does not break me out my skin
absolutely loves it and this is called
the luminous deep hydration lifting mask
so the difference between the first one
I talked about in this one is the first
one definitely has a more wetness sticky
like deep hydration and this one for me
personally I notice more of a luminosity
so if I wear this at night the next
morning when I wake up I can see a
noticeable difference in my skin just
glowing and having a radiance like if I
wanted my makeup to go on beautifully
the next day I would wash my face I
would exfoliate I would use this in the
next morning like my school pick oh I
saved my number one the best for last
which of course is the most expensive
and they did send this to me for free
like NPR and I loved it so much that I
bought another three pack from Sephora
because I have gone through all of them
and this is the Lancome Lancome
genifique what is it actually called use
activating second skin mask that's
exactly what this mofo is it makes me
feel like I have a new set of skin for
like two days after I use this this
right here is one of the top masks that
I've ever used in my book I'm waiting
for it to like screw me over and do me
wrong because I think it's too good to
be true it's so hydrating it makes my
skin glow like nothing else just like an
inner radiance like it doesn't cause any
issues any bumps any textures it just it
looks so my skin looks so beautiful
after using this every time I put it on
I walk around the house and I try to
scare John and you laughs but it's it is
absolutely amazing this one I know so
it's my dad so two other masks this one
I've raved about so many times on
snapchat on video I'm never about again
I bought two more because I ran out pink
at this point I probably actually gone
through four bottles of
and then I bought this one and the other
one that I have now at my house and this
is that map that everyone sees all over
Instagram and snapchat that makes you
look like a 10 man where it's completely
and totally silver this is I think my
favorite Universal glam glow mask like
if someone were say which match should I
get and I didn't know their skin type
this is the one that I would refer
because it's going to work for everybody
no matter what your skin need is no
matter if you're oily dry sensitive
combination this one right here is
amazing because it just tightens your
pores and firms your skin so much and it
just makes your skin like shiny not
hydrated not luminous but your actual
skin it's like tight to the point that
it shines like I've been recommending
this to all my friends all my family
anytime I have a girlfriend come over
they're not wearing makeup I'm like
let's see what masks and this is the one
that I always want to do and it's so fun
to paint it on and then peel it off it's
like there's something so satisfying
about peeling off this mask the last
mask is a mask that Jeffrey actually
referred to me months and months and
months ago and I bought it and I use it
like two times but then I just got lazy
I fell off the whole skincare bandwagon
I was just doing like the basic you know
morning and night routine but I picked
back up on this and I love this so much
it's by Sisley and it's called the black
rose cream mask and it is just like a
straight cream mask it feels when it
comes out it feels like a moisturizer
and it smells like straight rose which I
actually don't love I don't really like
the smell roses and fresh roses yes but
not like rose scented things but yeah I
absolutely love this mask I'll leave it
on my skin but 20 or 30 minutes just in
the morning when I take it off oh my god
your makeup will go on so smooth and so
beautiful I don't know what it's
technically supposed to do it doesn't
even smoothing plumping and brightening
okay exactly it's just a beautiful mask
I feel like I could never get enough of
it I can wear it every single day and my
skin would never like get used to it
like it's just it's a gorgeous gorgeous
mask so kind of sticking with skincare
I'm going to talk about this body wash
and this is by Bath and Body Works and
if you know me you know that I am
peppermint obsessed I like how this is
still on here like I'm so lazy that the
bottle is basically empty and I haven't
even taken off the plastic in my shower
this is the twisted peppermint body wash
I am so because the peppermint
peppermint everything like I literally a
peppermint oil right here that I use for
my headaches and my upsets some are
going to have all the time
peppermint candles around my house Erma
and body wash I just peppermint sencha
anything chapstick like I love it so
there's also one buy philosophy that's
called candy cane I don't like that one
as much as this because this is like
very minty but it doesn't make your body
feel cold like have you ever tried a
body wash where it's peppermint and like
you're like watching yourself Alison
right oh my god this is freezing cold on
your body this does not give that
sensation if it does it's very mild and
it goes away within seconds but it just
smells so good and so peppermint tea
this is the first bottle then I bought a
second bottle because it is a holiday
limited edition item and I'm obsessed oh
my god speaking of peppermint it's just
so random but I brought these over here
for snacks they're the peppermint
pretzels some names from Trader Joe's oh
my god I think I bought I think I bought
eight bags of these at Trader Joe's
because I bought every single bag they
had they're like I was like I'm clearing
it out because I wait for the holidays
for Trader Joe's to commodities its
chocolate-covered pretzels with little
chunks of like peppermint like candy
cane on it it looks like that I'm I'm
gonna put this in my mouth right now
because this video will end and I'll be
on the floor and a peppermint Cola oh my
gosh bomb so some of you may remember I
used to talk about this really small
brand that was sold on Etsy and it was
called the blissful body and I was just
in love with their body butters and the
woman who owns the brand it's just such
a sweet woman she gives a percentage of
all her sales to a woman's organization
and she's doing everything by herself
like by hand with her family she's such
a sweetheart like we've emailed forever
and she's just the nicest woman but
anyways the brand got a total remodel
like several months ago and it's now
known as LeAnn grace instead of the
blissful body so she no longer is on
Etsy she has her own individual website
she's come a really long way her stuff
is in glass jars now new packaging
everything is very sleek I'm just still
so obsessed with this
and I could talk about every single
thing there chapstick their scrubs their
motion their butters everything their
oil oh my god like there's straight oil
I use it in my hair I use it on my body
I use it on my face all the time it's so
amazing but this this is the body butter
and creamy peppermint oh my god
it isn't like the best part of my day is
getting out of the shower after using
that peppermint body wash and applying
my creamy peppermint body butter it is
so bomb it's honestly that the best body
butter I've ever used I love a lot of
different body butters I'm obsessed with
just moisture and hydration on the body
but I swear this one just beats
everything and it's natural and that's
the best part and like it has all the
ingredients right here for you and
literally it's like avocado oil Oliveira
jus shea butter like everything's right
here made by hand all natural like it's
amazing it smells so good and is so
hydrating so if you're looking for an
amazing body butter it's made by an
amazing woman I would check out Leanne
Grace it's it's balm and the fact that
she's off Etsy now and doing her own
thing is amazing I'm gonna talk about
one more product that I just recently
discovered by her oh my god you guys
this has changed my life so this is her
face scrub what's a technically called a
face and body polish and it says with
colloidal silver which is awesome it
just looks like this I don't want to
spill it forward because it's like runny
if you can see inside there it's got
like oil in it so I just take a little
tiny scoop the tiniest scoop will do
I've used this probably ten times you
can see it's still the very top I
haven't used up my body though I'm only
using on my face you guys talk about the
most intense exfoliation of all time it
feels like straight sand on your face so
if you're someone like me who's looking
to get in there and like clean your face
and scrub your face like it just feels
so good to me because it has all these
natural oils in it as you are
exfoliating you're also moisturizing
your face at the same time like I
haven't actually done this but if you
were to explain with this and not even
moisturize you probably would be totally
fine because it is so moisturizing like
it has oil in it so you're getting an
oil while you're getting such a deep
exfoliation it's amazing like this is a
standout product for the month for
sure the first thing I used it I came
out of the bathroom like oh that's right
number one products of the whole month
actually moving on next I have talked
about this brand in the past but this is
another product that I use constantly
literally every single week but I
haven't actually talked about it
probably since my video that I made and
this is the loving tan at two hour
Express sunless tanner I'm just going to
make it like straight to the point if
you guys are looking for the best tanner
in the entire world this is it right
here this brand used to be Australia
only but they are in the u.s. now thank
you Lord it is the best sunless tanner
of all time they do have different
options in different colors of course
but the one that I constantly use is a
two hour Express in the shade dark and
then they have the other one which is
like the six to eight hour that's an
ultra dark blue curl you want to be dark
like you spent the past 10 days like in
the Caribbean islands that's that it'll
do it for you
but I just use a two hour dark my friend
Jackie she does mobile spray tanning and
she's spray chance maybe like once or
twice a month
and when she spray tans me this is what
she uses like she had like the big huge
like professional jug of the two-hour
expressed and that's what she uses on me
when she sprays me as well so this is
the only thing I use I've tried a couple
other sunless Tanner's in the past year
nothing ever it holds a candle to this I
always go back to it like all the old
tanners I used to be obsessed with I'm
like no like nothing compares is
absolutely amazing I do have a discount
code for it um I hate my genius combos
it makes me feel uncomfortable I used to
mention them all the time on my channel
and now I like I never mentioned them
because it makes me feel so weird people
are always like you're a sponsor you're
using a discount code and no look I'm
not sponsored at all like yeah I'm an
affiliate and I have a discount cokes I
think this product is the best product
ever and that's just my honest opinion
but I do it as count code if you do want
to save some cash money I have a couple
of lip products I have been loving and
the first two are both a Marc Jacobs lip
glosses and you guys know that these
partly in my top three favorite gloss
formulas ever but these two glosses I
have been obsessed with the actual
shades the past couple of weeks and this
first one is pretty thing and it's
really a beautiful nude you guys know
I'm obsessed with sugar
sugar which is very pale this one has a
little bit more of a pink undertone in
it but it's still so gorgeous and
recently I have been wearing sugar sugar
but if I'm wearing a nude lip and then I
put sugar sugar over top it's so new
that I feel like my lips are gone on I
just look kind of silly so I've been
wearing pretty thing over top and it's
just so pretty because it's got that
hint of pink in it but they're not
really opaque glosses so I'm not like
boom like they just give it a sheer kind
of wet glossy look which I just love and
then this one is in the shade love buzz
and this one if you told me a year ago I
don't like this color I would have
slapped you across the head and be like
girl talk about because it's a metallic
so it has a pinky golden undertone in it
right here so beautiful wear this by
yourself by yourself by itself put it
over a pink but over a nude it's just so
pretty it's actually a gorgeous summer
color but I don't follow any of these
rules especially in Florida it's like it
feels like it's summer all around it's
literally 84 degrees today so it's like
I don't know I can't get on board with
like the winter makeup looks because I'm
living in such a hot sticky climate but
love buzz is gorgeous and then the last
lip product product the boss looked
product the last lip product is the tart
tart East glossy lip paints when I first
put this on all the way is this going to
dry and I looked all that oh yeah
Jacqueline it says glossy so it doesn't
dry it stays glossy it looks like this
it's a very opaque it's such a pretty
pinky nude it's just like that standard
pinky nude that I just needed in my life
so much and iris by itself or over a
lipstick and I really like the way it
wears it so for the last makeup item ooh
girl I talked about these on snapchat
I've only actually used them on my eyes
once though so I can't say like I've
used every color or 45 times like no
like I've only does them once just being
honest but they are these new morphe
palettes Oh
oh my god oh I'm just gonna take a
moment okay I'm gonna give you guys a
quick moment just to digest call your
mom call your friend call your grandmom
calls what we got a call right now
crying
let it all out get out of your system I
know I know these caught me a very much
off-guard when I saw them post these on
their website I was like not the website
their Instagram all's and my heart
they're just so different and cool like
I just love the square I love that
they're so amazing I honestly don't know
which palette I liked the most like this
one is like the three five oh all over
again
just and Oh amazing but this one has
more like purples and pewter give you
like a few more swatches watches so you
can see the shimmers are so pigmented
like I've never seen a morphe palette
that's this pigmented like that's not
even anything like I could just like
keep going like the pigment on these are
insane like and I'm not doing like
intense digging swatches either like
I'll show you like actual true pigment I
can't I can't like I'm doing this in one
so you guys can see without me cutting
the camera so that no one thinks I'm
like a lot about this big guy or
anything they're flipping beautiful I
feel like the mats are like pretty
standard just normal more feet mats
which are very nice but the shimmers are
on another level like this I don't think
I've ever seen these kind of shimmers
from morphe before they're just they're
beautiful I say this is so awesome with
the square packaging and the square
eyeshadow and the clear front like
they're badass these are actually out
yet I don't even know what do they come
out I think I think the box said next
Monday Tuesday I don't know all that you
guys know on snapchat if you follow me
there it's just Jacqueline R Hill I'll
let you guys know I don't actually know
the exact day that they launch but you
do know I have a discount cut with that
hey so if you want to save some money
you know I've got you boo the last two
items that I've talked about are both
fashion related this is definitely like
fashion piece but the next is just a
cozy comfy thing that I have been living
in the past month but these right here
are faux fur scarves by the brand soul
Society I got these at Nordstrom I have
only more this one it so far and I am
just like desperately waiting for the
temperature to drop again because we
have like
days of cold weather and I'm waiting sad
to come back so I can wear these but
they're just so cool and they just look
so awesome especially draped over
jackets or a sweater and wore this
burgundy one um I actually took picture
so the blog post will be up on that
maybe even before this video goes line I
have to say you guys how I am just
overwhelmed by how amazingly supportive
you guys have been of me doing fashion
posts on my blog like it has made me so
happy I mean I've always done makeup but
I've never really had the confidence to
do an actual fashion blogging because
I'm always like there's so many people
who were so much better than me um you
know I'm like I just I have my own style
I do my own thing and I just feel like I
don't know if people are gonna like it
but I am just I'm so grateful for how
loving you guys have been and every
since can I post a blog I did get
emotional reading the comments on there
you guys are just so kind and supportive
and I'm just I'm very thankful for it
like you you have no idea very thankful
for you guys just being so open and
wonderful and yeah I love you guys
anyways I can't wait to wear this one
right here but this green like I can't
fit this Foresti green with like and I
don't know the golden all of the
undertone I know the cameras are picking
it up very well
and then this one right here I live for
this like just throwing it over top of
like a leather jacket it's just so cool
it just looks so luxe I figured out a
mention to you guys I got them maybe
like all of them they need a tune 1/2
weeks ago three weeks ago and just the
past couple days I've seen so many
bloggers posting with these and I'm like
oh yes if they're amazing they're
becoming a thing so I thought that would
let you guys know about them in case
they're gonna sell out soon with
everyone talking about them they're
awesome last item is something that I
just I have to talk about because anyone
who shows up to my house the past month
I am wearing this might be hard to show
on camera because it's so big it's by
the brand barefoot dreams which is the
most amazing my most favorite comfy
brand of all time it is pricey or sure
especially for like loungewear but worth
every penny you've never felt anything
like this in your life it is the softest
most coziest almost like moisturizing
high
reading feeling fabric ever and this
right here I've worn it several times on
snapchat something all the time I might
actually have it in two colors I have in
this and then in a grey and it's a
turtleneck it goes over your body and
it's this huge poncho your item you'll
see it because it's so big this is huge
poncho and at the very bottom it has
fringe on it like this and it has
armholes to come out like this so
literally it's a good turtleneck like
this with arm holes right here but
they're like hangs down to your knees
with this fringe it is literally like
wearing a Snuggie it is better than that
it's amazing if you swear it with
sweatpants around your house it's like
you put it on you click you're walking
around just living life in a blanket it
is so amazing or you can throw on some
like over the knee boots and leggings
and actually wear it out so I'll link it
down below so you guys can see what it
looks like on the model because I know
I'm not to show you guys a very good
like interpretation but if you're
looking to spend some money on like the
coziest thing in the world this is it
right here like I've told my entire
family and friends I'm buying this for
everybody in my life for Christmas
