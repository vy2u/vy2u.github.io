everybody and welcome to my November
favorite and I'm gonna be talking on us
with you guys
November was the worst month ever and I
am so glad it's over
like all these other people on you too
are like oh my god never my so fast time
flies when you're having fun and I'm
like it sucked ass so this is my first
favorite video I've ever done and I feel
kind of awkward about it but that's okay
you guys have asked me for it for so
long the past two months I was like
should I know
it's like I need to get over and just do
it and I do like watching favorite
videos myself so I might as well you
know it's happening so here we go so
let's just jump into it because I picked
out I feel like a lot of stuff but
hopefully it's not overwhelming I'm
gonna charm to move really quickly so
I'm gonna start with skincare because
I've been trying some new things this
month and I am so in love with them okay
first off um is the purity face wash by
philosophy eye that's it I'm done Peary
okay so my philosophy this is the best
face wash I think I've ever used I'm not
even kidding it gets your skin so
stinkin clean and like I put like a
generous about my hand what my face then
I wash my face and it takes off every
speck of makeup and I was noticing that
like I've talked about in my skincare
video that I had like a little bumps and
I didn't know what they were and this
and that I'm a la anyways they were
basically completely gone but not
totally and then I got this cuz I was
like oh you know it's supposed to be
like really gentle and cleansing but
it's supposed to go deep into the pores
and get all the dirt out and bacteria so
I was like let's give it a shot now that
I'm using this my skin has finally hit a
new place where it's like it's doing
good and I think the issue all along was
that I wasn't getting my skin as clean
as I should so this is awesome and it's
inexpensive I went to lush unplanned
and I've never been like a lush freak
ever in my life but I just like walked
past and I went in and they completely
sold me this ocean salt face and body
scrub oh look at the little cute man
that made it for me he's so happy
smells kind of weird and tastes
disgusting it's not edible so I
shouldn't be
in the first place but this is such an
awesome base scrub I haven't used on my
body because I really care I have other
stuff in my body then but I was scared I
was gonna break me out send you some
things from lush before and they really
irritated my skin and I don't know why
it's supposed to be natural whatever but
this is awesome
I absolutely love it I've been using it
like 3 to 4 times a week it's so huge I
feel like it's gonna take me months to
go through which is awesome but I love
it it's one of the best exploiters I've
ever used and I am NOT an exfoliator
person because I just use sugar to
exfoliate my face this is the only
exfoliator I've ever used in my life
that is that unique change my opinion on
that next are 2 Mario Badescu pieces a
skincare the first one I'll say it's the
Cure moisturizer it's for drying
sensitive skin because the more like
cool it gets outside the drier my skin
is getting this is for dry and sensitive
and I I just love it I use it every
single day it's so moisturizing but I
can put it on and then immediately do my
makeup and you know how some
moisturizers it's like you could put it
on you have to let it sit for at least
15-20 minutes because it's like sticky
and people should makeup on and kind of
slide around not this one I put it on
and it's like a primer and I can just go
straight with my foundation and it's
perfect
last skincare thing is the caviar night
cream I am obsessed this is thick stuff
it's like it doesn't move like see how
thick that is it's like it's almost like
a bomb like it's not gonna it's not
going to move it's thick as can be you
just like dig your finger in it and you
can definitely feel it on your skin when
you put it on it's not sticky but you're
gonna feel it it's you know what I mean
anyways I mix this a lot with my josie
maran argan oil and I just like slather
my face in it like 20 minutes before I
get into bed I'm just like oh when I
wake up in the morning I just like I
have I feel like I have new skin every
single morning it's I am very extremely
happy with my skincare right now
and then one more thing is this little
tiny lip balm from lush I'm a Burt's
Bees most of the time kind of person I
think Burt's Bees does the job in the OS
but this is called honey trap and it's
like it's like waxy but it's I will put
it on before I fall asleep I will wake
up in the morning and
so all my lips like my lips are still
completely and totally moisturize where
normally I literally wake up in the lie
and reapply chapstick because I'm I'm
that crazy um I have been obsessed with
L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation if
you're curious I'm Shea w5 and I am just
obsessed with this now this w5 by itself
isn't really my color it's a little too
pink it's the same shade but not the
same tone it's a little too pink and
it's like I can get away with it but not
really so I've been mixing it with Mac's
mineralize foundation it's the cream it
looks like so this is n shade NC 35
really I thought I was an NC 30 okay
anyways I've been using these two
together so I pump this on the back of
my hand and I take my sibling brush I
dab it in the Mac and then I'd add on
the back of my hand and I just go to
work and it's the perfect color and it
gives me like a natural dewy finish and
it keeps me hydrated all day long and
seriously props to L'Oreal for this
foundation I am I'm obsessed with it
it's gorgeous
then for other things on the face this
Maybelline concealer I don't know what
it's called it literally just says
Maybelline and that's it but it's the
only one that's in this wand packaging
and mine is in shade fair it's not the
lightest shade it's the second to
lightest shade and it's that looks like
completely nothing but it's um
there we go it's pretty opaque
especially for a drugstore concealer and
I love it most of the time I mix it in
with my pro longwear concealer which is
my favorite concealer of all time but
you can also use it by itself and it
just has like this gentle dewy look and
I love it it's it's awesome it's great
for highlighting so yes that's been an
awesome drugstore favorite for lipsticks
my favorite lipstick of this month has
been rebel by Mac and it looks like this
a lot of girls have been giving this a
shout out recently I've seen it on
YouTube I can't talk and it's like this
purple pink oh it is so pretty and I
will absolutely love it it's a satin
because it doesn't
any Frost's in it and there's not that
much shine it's just the right amount I
have been wearing it a lot with max
night moth I had this in my last makeup
tutorial that I did so night moth is
pretty dark but then I put rebel on
overtop of it especially in the center
of the lips kind of gives you a really
nice ombre lip with the really dark
purple and the lighter pink or purple
umm this eyeliner by NARS and I cannot
pronounce this to save my life
rue Bonaparte a robot apart bought a
bona party anyways it's just I use this
in my last video too because I've been
using all the time it's a cream color so
it's not white it's the color of your
skin and it looks so great in the
waterline with whatever you're wearing
it just opens up your eyes so bright I
love it it looks good with every color
re in love with this I used to love this
mascara and then I stopped for a while
and I'm black so it's the matte false
lashes mascara now I'm not a believer
and having to buy high-end mascaras at
all my all my mascaras are from the
drugstore had a few from Mac but this
one I am obsessed with for the bottom
lashes only because I have really long
bottom lashes so this may not apply to a
lot of you but like most mascaras and I
probably bottom lashes it just clumps up
and like sticks together or it doesn't
get all my lashes and it's just it's
wrong in all the right ways so this I
just love love this mascara for my
bottom lash line the wand looks like
this
I haven't bent to the side this is not
what your one will look like when you
get it but when I apply my mascara I
bend my wand and then I apply it like
this because it's easier to maneuver
with my hands and then when I put it
back in the tube I just straighten it
out so yes Mac false lashes Mac Pro
Longwear lip glasses oh my gosh I saved
the best for last
these are I'm wearing this one right now
this is infinitely lickable infinitely
lickable so I don't need to swatch it
for you because you can see it is on my
lips and then this one is forever rose
and this one I have on my lips at the
end
of my fall makeup tutorial there's like
a picture I have at the very end it's
right there but you can see like if you
dip it in there you can see how big
these are like yeah it they don't mess
around and they're pro longwear they're
supposed to last for an extended amount
of time and they literally do they say
glossy all day and they stay on all day
and I don't understand how but they're
like they're creamy and they're shiny
and they're on for hours and like I
don't have to retouch my lips like when
I work an eight-hour shift I only have
to put it on when I go in and then after
my lunch break and that's it it just
stays on all day even with all the
talking that I'm doing so I'm happy
about that
my last thing I want to mention here is
necklaces these came out at Nordstrom
for Black Friday they still have them
they are still online they were our door
Busters and these are like Shazam
necklaces okay yes I do not want to wear
it in this video because I have a light
behind me and it's gonna blind you guys
I get the sparkle but they they're
gorgeous and everyone that I work with
bought them like in every single color
and they just Sparkle and they scream
holiday so I got rented that color and
then I also got one in this color
now you gosh yes yes yes you would not
believe the price and that's why I
mentioning them because they are from
Nordstrom and they are can you that's
right 28 28 dollars for these necklaces
and honestly if there was any other time
of the year and these necklaces came out
they'd be like 50 60 bucks but they're
$28 I love them they have them in hot
pink and emerald green silver um I
remember anyways they're gorgeous so
that's that I hope you enjoy so that's
it for this video and I'll talk to you
guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
