quality I've never done a meet and greet
like with Sephora in Union Square in New
York City is just I feel like when I get

just bawl my eyes out a key time I'm all
on my sister like make sure that you're
like joking around with me and laughing
because I know I'm gonna walk in there
and I'm just gonna start bawling this is
this is the most surreal moment to date
I'm so happy that you guys are gonna
come with me

have subscribers waiting in line right
now and it's raining and I feel so bad
and I and I asked back I was like can

umbrellas or something like uh sucks

I feel so bad this some people are going
to be outside
ah
so yeah I just got back from my meet and
greet and I'm gonna warn you that I
might cry um I've been crying all day do
you remember asking about voices just
from like wearing myself out so much um
I just wanted to take a moment just to
say thank you because I have moments
like this quite often but I never
actually document it and vlog it so I
just wanted to take advantage of this
moment and just thank you guys
personally from the bottom of my heart
today was a meet and greet at Sephora as
you guys saw and it was it was just like
the most magical loving filled day I've
ever had in my life
and I'm just I'm just so ridiculously
grateful for you guys you really have no
idea and I just have to give a personal
thank you to everybody who came and not

wanted to be there and the people who
just take time to support me just I just
really feel like the luckiest girl in
the entire world because of you guys I
swear um anyways I need to get myself
together like right now I have no joke
been crying ever since I left a
meet-and-greet I'm really good at
keeping it together holding and like in
front of you guys but like the second I
got in the car I just started bawling uh
it just I'm just overwhelmed I have to
make a confession and that is I allow
the hairs to get to me a lot I'm not one
of those people because I can just say
like screw the haters I don't care what
they have to say um I have an obsessive
need to please everybody and when I see
people leaving mean comments or making
accusations about my life it gets some
unit affects me and it dictates like the
way I act on youtubes I can just like
freak out sometimes but today after
meeting hundreds of you guys just really
loving me for me and just being so
emotionally beautiful it was just like I
don't give a about the people who
have negative things to say anymore you
guys have just given me so much
inspiration there's so many of you guys

many of you just had such a beautiful
things to say and I'm just so grateful

courting me and I posted a photo on
Instagram of um me in Sephora I am so

watch on camera but this is how I'm
feeling and after today like I really
don't care who sees me cry cuz it's just
like ah let me show you real quick of me
standing next to my face it's like this
huge like seven-foot poster of myself in
