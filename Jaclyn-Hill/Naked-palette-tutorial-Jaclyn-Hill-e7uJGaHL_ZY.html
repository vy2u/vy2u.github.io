another tutorial for you guys you have
all requests well not all of you but I
have got a bunch of requests a
significant amount of requests from you
guys asking me to do a tutorial using
the naked palette by urban decay so that
is why I'm here doing I think a lot of
you guys own this palette and it's
really easy because there's so many
stinking colors in it so you can go out
and spend a solid amount of money and
have all of these and so I totally
understand why you want me to do a naked
palette
tutorial because it is an amazing
palette and if you don't like it it's
because you don't own it it is the best
palette ever it is amazing it's very
versatile so this is the look that I
came up with I use my three favorite
colors in this palette I mean I want to
say there are my three favorite colors
but they're really pretty um if you
notice my lighting is a little bit
different today my camera setting is I
don't know my camera is different and
it's like sunset right now it's super
super bright in here so hopefully he
doesn't like really annoy you um as I
was filming I was like whoa that's
really bright but it didn't seem like it
was that big of a deal
um traning there's anything else I need
to say Jen I hope you enjoy the video
and I'm buddy okay so I am using the
Naked palette like I said before and the
first color I'm gonna go in with is
naked and this is this mid-tone matte
brown normally I use soft Brown from Mac
but because we're doing all naked
palette and I'm gonna be strict and do
all naked palette I'm using naked and
this is a lot like soft Brown so if you
have the Naked palette you don't need to
run out and get soft Brown it's just a
little bit more Brown and not as pink is
soft brown but it's gonna work the exact
same and it's gonna be that in-between
blending color so I'm throwing it in
there as normal then I'm going to go in
with sidecar this is going to be my main
color on my eyes for this video it's
definitely a color that's neutral but it
still causes attention is that the word
is still causes attention yes I still
demand attention it's kind of chunky so
as you can see I like dab my brush in
like all the powder fell off every time
I dip my brush into the eyeshadow
product itself I dab my brush because
that glitter it's in it it's going to
fall down all of my cheeks now it's
going to happen no matter what but if
you dab off your brush first it won't
happen as heavily so I'm taking this
from inner to outer corner and I dab all
over my lid and then I swipe in my
crease back and forth from my crease all
the way down to my outer corner but I
don't go in swiping with this color
otherwise the pigment isn't going to get
on your lid as much and it's going to
fall all over your cheek so I dab bursts
and then I swipe from inner corner all
the way to outer corner um you can also
watch your brush brush with fix+ which I
tell you guys is always or get a little
water on your brush or anything and it's
going to make this color even more
pigmented and she'll be even prettier
and more sparkly and more shimmery I'm
not doing that in this tutorial but I
have done it before so now I'm going to
go in with buck and this is a little bit
darker of a brown so we're like having
the pretty sidecar which is like really
shimmery and then the mid-tone Brown
that we used to blend out and this
darker Brown and as you can see I'm
using a stiffer brush like normal
nothing fancy and I'm just putting it
out in that outer corner this is a
really basic eye it's really simple and
it's really really pretty I love these
colors together and I think these colors
can basically look good on everybody
everybody you can be very very fair and
still wear these colors so this color
isn't super easy to blend so once I put
it in there with my brush I'm gonna go
back with this brush just any fluffier
brush and I'm going over with no product
on it as you can see it's really helping
it just like dust it out so that there's
no harsh lines because I felt like there
were before and that's like a fear of
mine no not really
okay I'm cleaning up under my eyes with
just any makeup remover or you can just
use moisturizer and a q-tip you can use
eye cream whatever it is and just wipe
it away okay so now I have on my liner
and my lashes and you guys know how to
do liner now because I just made a video
for you so if you don't know how to do
your eyeliner
go back and watch me it might be fun you
might be surprised okay and I'm putting
mascara all over my lashes is normal to
buy my natural my falsies together oh my
god I just said falsies Wow okay so I'm
using Laura Mercier's Moisture something
moisture supreme found
I think so I don't know I've only owned
this foundation for like a month but I
really really like it but I'm actually a
little too dark for it now because I've
been in the Sun a lot this last month I
feel like in Florida you would get tan
even just thinking about going outside
like you don't necessarily have to be
outside you're just so hot no matter
where you are but you're just brown okay
that was really stupid
anyways I'm blending this all over my
face with my Sigma flat kabuki brush
which is my favorite foundation of all
time and I think I'm gonna be doing a
foundation routine video for you soon
because I've gotten a lot of requests so
stay tuned and then I'm going in with
Laura Mercier's duo concealer palette I
don't know what the exact name of this I
don't remember
um I'm sorry I'll list it in the
description box below and I'm just using
the pink tone because you always want to
highlight your under eye with pink tones
even if you are as all of us can be or
pangas can be you always want to put a
pink color underneath your eyes I worked
at Mac for almost three years and I
don't think once I sold a yellow tone
for somebody underneath their eye area
so pink tones under the eye area and I'm
going straight down from the outer
corner and meeting it right at the
corner my nose and I'm gonna take it all
the way up to the outer wing outer
corner of my eye and then fill in the
middle you see me do this all the time
let me know if you want a video on
concealer I've had just I think one or
two people asked me but if you want to
see it I will do it for you okay and now
I'm setting my under eye area with
powder I'm just using I'm a pressed
powder and nw20 by Mac these I think I'm
having a reaction to the mineral skin
finish really sadly but I've been
getting all these little bumps on that
area recently and it's just in the area
where I put that powder so I'm taking a
break to kind of test out my skin so now
I'm using a look at the difference
between my eyebrows and as insanity like
seriously yes okay I'm just using cork
to fill in as always again I'm going to
be making a video on this soon just give
me some time patience patience now I'm
going to go in with virgin this is the
only light highlighting color in the
palette I'm going to tap it under my eye
now this is frosty so I'm putting it
there and then after I get it under
there I'm going to take my finger and
just kind of like rub it around a little
bit yeah
grubbé so that it's not like a choppy
harsh white line now I'm going to use
NARS Laguna bronzer and this has a
little bit of shimmer in it so I'm using
it with a big brush because I don't want
to actually put under my cheekbones to
sculpt my face because their shimmer I
don't like doing that
I'm just getting a huge brush and I'm
just tossing all over the cheek area
just to bronze my face because I think
that with this look we already have so
much shimmer and browns and we've got
cat eyeliner I don't need really
hardcore contours on my cheeks so after
that I'm going in with this Revlon just
bitten lip stain it's like the big
crayon and I love this stuff it's the
nude I haven't seen anybody talk about
it but it's my obsession
you guys I'm obsessed I use everyday
even when I'm not wearing makeup I love
it that's a little bit of a lie it's not
a lie but I stretch the truth a little
bit okay
so then I'm wearing this mary lou
manizer by the balm so the first time
I'm wearing it and I'm not really sure
how I like it
throughout the day I was kind of like
you okay but like when I first put it on
I was like I don't know but yeah I'll
get back to you now I'm just dusting on
some NARS orgasm wash I'm sorry it's
just like awkward saying that word to
you especially cuz I'm like all by
myself right now I'm just like talking
to my computer okay so after that you
can be done finished walk out the door
or you can continue a few more steps and
just take a little precise blush brush
not a blush and put on a little bit of
black powder eye shadow of any sort and
put it underneath your eye area tight on
that lash line and then when you do that
you can go back and grab that naked
color or a buck or whatever you please
and just dust it out with a pencil brush
the reason I put the black eyeshadow on
there first
is because I wanted a little something
to sculpt my eye so that you it would
bring more attention to my eye I didn't
want to just go in with a nude color
otherwise you kind of lose my eyes on my
face but putting that black shot there
first is going to bring attention to
that bottom eye area and make them look
bigger
okay so then after that I am putting on
mascara we all know how to do this I'm
using that stiletto one it's diletto by
somebody I don't know I picked up in my
drugstore and I really liked it for my
bottom lashes after that you are done
thank you so much for watching guys and
have a great day I hope
you enjoyed by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
