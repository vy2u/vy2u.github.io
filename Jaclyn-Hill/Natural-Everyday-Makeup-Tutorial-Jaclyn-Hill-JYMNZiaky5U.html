very different than what I normally do
on my channel it is very neutral this is
an everyday look this is something that
I have done for like two or three years
it's just kind of like my fallback place
where I'm comfortable and safe in this
area and I can do this look in 15
minutes and run out the door so I hope
you guys like this there are no false
lashes today which is strange because I
always do false lashes in my videos but
I've gotten a lot of questions from
people asking me if I wear false lashes
every single day and no I don't
I only wear them like once twice maybe
three times a week umm I wear them to
work mostly but when I'm not working and
this is normally how I look or I don't
wear any makeup at all I do not work
false lashes when I am not working
unless it's like a special event but
anyway so yes today is all about like
very minimal makeup at least the look of
minimal makeup I do use a good amount of
products but you know using just a
little bit at a time a little bit here a
little bit there just to make it look
like you're not wearing too much so it's
a very simple look it'll really enhance
your natural beauty without like
pounding on a bunch of makeup and give
yourself that frosting cakey look so I
hope you guys enjoy and I will see you
the next video bye
so yes I have a pimple get over a
Jacqueline there are real issues in the
world first thing I'm doing is taking
any eye serum and rubbing it gently all
over the eye area I'm really prepping my
skin today because I'm not going to be
covering it up with tons and tons of
makeup so I really want the skin to look
really good so I was throwing out my
hair since I am going to be working on
my face and I don't like my hair down
all over me so I'm using Mac's natural
radiance primer and completely ignore
you guys for the TV come on get with the
program so now I'm using come on get
back here Jaclyn are you kidding me I am
so sorry so rude I'm going to use
L'Oreal Lumi true match foundation I've
talked about it a little too much I
think I'm absolutely obsessed with it
I'm shade w5 as you can see it's darker
than my face but when I like swipe it on
my neck it's the exact same shade as my
neck that's why I choose to put this
shade on my face obviously I'm going to
spend some time covering up that pimple
you know you do a do so I'm just going
to be with circular motions I'm using
the Sigma f80 brush which is a flat top
synthetic kabuki brush this is my
absolute favorite brush to apply
foundation of all time and I feel like
at this point I've tried every style
possible and this just amazing so now
I'm going to use Garnier skin renew anti
dark circle weight circle roller yeah
this has a little bit of tint in it and
I'm also going to use Mac's prep and
prime radiant rose highlighter so I'm
going to mix those two together on the
eye area I'm going to go in with the
Garnier first and just roll that all
under the eye there's one that doesn't
have a color in it that's just simply to
help with dark circles but I want the
color of mine so I'm going to put that
all around that area and then I'm going
to use Mac's radiant rose and these are
both very sheer that's why I'm putting
on a very scary amount but I want this
to be all over the eye area this is
going to act as my highlight concealer
and my base for my eye shadow so I'm
going to rub this all around you can see
as I'm blending it out how sheer it is
it's going to cover but it's not cakey
it's really it's it's amazing I love
this product I use this Garnier roller
all the time when I'm not looking for
something full coverage now when I'm
doing like a really intense eye I do
like to use more full
Brij concealer under my eye area I just
feel like it really balances out the eye
makeup that I'm working with but when
I'm doing like a very natural looking
product natural lashes natural shadow I
want natural concealer I don't want to
be cake face that's not a good look so
then I'm going to go in with mac studio
finish concealer I'm going to use this
where I think it's needed and I'm in
shade NC 30 so I'm going to put it in
between my eyebrows because I always get
a little bit of redness there I'm going
to put it on my chin I'm going to put it
right there make sure I dab that near
the pimple and I'm going to just buff
this all in with the exact same brush I
don't use too much of it just a little
bit and it'll go a long way if you do
feel like you have like smile line
wrinkles very intensely you may not want
to put it on that area because this
concealer will settle so I'm going to
now I'm going to use that bright white
powder that you see all the way to the
left and it's called Mac accentuate it
is a Mac Pro sculpting powder it can be
bought at any Mac Pro store you do not
have to be a professional makeup artist
to go to one of those stores and
purchase anything there I don't know if
they still do it they used to let you
call the online store and order things
that way and I also heard that they're
starting to make it open to the public
to order Mac Pro things online I don't
know if that's true because since I do
work there I don't I'm not sure if
that's true because I can always see the
Mac Pro stuff so I'm going to use
lingering eyebrow pencil and give you a
little peek see at how I do my brows so
this is something I've been doing
recently because I really like how this
looks as opposed to how I've been
rocking my brows like full throttle like
bushy and saying so I always start at
the outer tail always and then I slowly
work my way into my inner corner and I
always use a little bit more pressure on
the outer wing and then when I get in
you can see I'm like barely touching it
I just really feather it up very very
lightly and then when I'm on the outer
corner I do push much harder now in this
video I do fill in my brows more
generously than I have been recently
I've been really trying to tame them
down as much as possible recently
because I'm kind of liking it for the
spring not making them huge even though
big huge brows are still and I'm just
trying something new I'm getting sick of
doing the same thing all the time so I'm
going to take Mac's mylar eyeshadow this
is I think in my top
my favorite eyeshadows from Mac I have
rediscovered it in the last few months
and I just love it I use all over the
lid my favorite thing about this product
is it looks gorgeous on mature skin you
know if you're 50 60 70 years old this
is a beautiful inner corner highlight to
really open up the eyes and bring
attention to that area but it barely has
any shimmer so it doesn't drag you down
so I'm using a Mac shroom just to touch
our Neath the brow bone I know I didn't
show a picture of the highlight shade
but I use it all the time I'm going to
use Mac's texture as you can see it's
one of my favorites I think that this is
my second one I've gone through as well
like I'm just obsessed with this color I
use it all the time it's got a tiny bit
of sparkle in it it's not actually
shimmery though just a little reflects
of like gold in it but on the eye it
looks completely matte it does not look
like it has any shimmer in it at all I
put this all over my eye a lot and you
can't even tell that it's got any
sparkle in it so I'm just dusting this
I'm using a Mac 224 brush and I am
working this from the outer corner all
the way to the inner corner I'm not
concentrating this on the inner corner
of the lid area I'm keeping this on the
outer edges it was kind of buffing it
around that area because I want this to
be really smooth and on the natural line
I'm not really packing it on so here's a
new way to do your eyeliner that I
haven't showed you before I'm going to
take smolder eye pencil which is a Kohl
any Kohl L'Oreal has a great Kohl Urban
Decay perversion is a great Kohl I'm
going to take it and it's going to rub
it densely into my low in my lash line
just right in those lashes you can see
I'm not doing anything special or
precise I'm just really rubbing it in
there because then we're going to take a
matte Brown this is ground Brown by Mac
and we're going to take this on a 2-1 to
matte brush um you can use anything that
you're comfortable with this is my
favorite brush and this was from my
holiday collection so the ferrule of it
is not bright silver it's like a pewter
color anyways I'm gonna take this and
I'm going to pull my it--on I know that
this makes you cringe because it makes
me cringe too I hate seeing myself do
this but if I don't do this it does not
blend so I just I try to just lightly
touch it and it's like ah but I'm just
gonna buff that from inner corner to
outer corner this is a foolproof way of
doing your eyeliner whenever I teach my
clients to do this they're like oh my
god I never knew this and I'm like
really so I thought I would show you
guys it's a really great way to get
every day I want to look it's super easy
you can't really mess this up because
you are buffing it out with a brown it's
not super harsh you don't to be really
precise you can kind of blend it up a
little bit make it a little bit smokey
or drag it out make it a little winged
you know okay and this does not help the
fact that I'm using a Mac eyelash curler
because I normally use a Revlon eyelash
curler but here it's like really
Jacqueline like you have to be such a
prima donna and bust out your Mac
eyelash curler so yeah we're not going
to talk about that but I'm just gonna
curl the lashes I squeeze them and as
I'm squeezing it and pumping it I kind
of pull it forward a little bit just to
kind of get a really nice curl so
they're not like intense like bent I
want them to have a really nice curl
from side view so I just kind of bring
it forward as I'm curling it I have no
idea what mascara I'm using I'm just
going to be honest I know it's L'Oreal I
know it's an all black tube I don't know
the name I am so sorry now I'm using
that same color texture and I'm going to
just buff this out all underneath the
eye area from inner corner to outer
corner very lightly as you can see I
only use two shadows today I want it to
be natural like I said I want it to just
have natural shadowing these colors look
very natural on me and then I'm going to
take peaches blush which I know you
think is weird
I'm sure and I'm going to just pop this
on the inner corner only okay I do this
because I think the blush looks so
natural on the eyes and it's just got
such a great powdery consistency it's
made for the cheeks oh it just looks
beautiful and there's no rules and
makeup and if there were I break them
anyways so now I'm taking max give me
Sun bronzer on a big huge brush and I'm
just going to dust this all over my face
I'm not contouring because once again I
don't want this to have any harsh edges
I want this all to be natural so I'm
just browsing the outer portion of my
face bringing it down the cheeks around
the forehead so on so forth and then I'm
going to just mascara the bottom lashes
this is Maybelline's mascara the one I
was talking about in my January
favorites
yeah January favorites oh my god it's
the time is flying what's going on where
the dislike last 14 days go happy
Valentine's Day anyway okay and then I'm
going to take that bottom color that I'm
pointing to and this is called spring
sheen it's very similar to NARS
orgasm or rock and Republic they have a
blush that was discontinued obviously
because the brand went out but call me
was the name of that very similar
gorgeous color peachy rosy and then I'm
going to take stereo Rose which came out
in the matte collection the appraised
chic and I'm going to use this as my
highlighter because I don't want to use
a frosty highlighter I don't want to put
on um you know like NARS Laguna or
anything like that because I'm sorry not
Laguna albatross because I want this to
stay natural like I said so then I'm
going to let down the hair because I'm
no longer working on the face and I'm
going to use Mac's luster ring
lipstick it's a very sheer pink but it's
gorgeous I love this pink it's not too
pink it's perfect and then I'm going to
use Revlon's lip gloss and Bellini I
believe it's called and after that your
look is complete I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video I hope that you
can do this on your own and it's easy
for you if you have any questions let me
know I love you forever and I will see
you soon yeah bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
