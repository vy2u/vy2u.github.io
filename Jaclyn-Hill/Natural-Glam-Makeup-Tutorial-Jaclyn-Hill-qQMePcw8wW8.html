this natural glam makeup look for you
and what I mean by natural glam is we
are going to be working with all neutral
tones but it is still a glamorous look
so this is a full face of makeup it is
not like a 5-minute natural makeup when
you're running out the door it is a full
face but instead of focusing on like
dramatic winged liner or an intense
contour we're really going to be
focusing on keeping everything soft and
feminine and blurred out the point of
this look is to really make it look like
you are just glowing from within and
just enhancing your natural beauty this
is very on-trend right now you see tons
of celebrities wearing this look and
tons of celebrity makeup artists wearing
and doing this look right now so I just
wanted to make a video showing you how
you can achieve it for yourself every
single person watching this video can do
this look and it will look good on you
and I can promise you that and it is so
easy to achieve anybody can do this so I
really hope that you enjoy this video as
always I love you guys so much and I'll
be seeing you soon
oh right guys the first thing I'm doing
is throwing my hair up so that we are
not distracted by it hanging all in my
face we are going to be starting off
with the skin today so I am going to
prime my face using L'Oreal magic Lumi
this is a light infusing primer and I'm
going to warm it up on my fingertips and
press it into my skin
pressing primer into your skin will help
with the longevity and make it work much
better then we're going in with lush
feeling younger this is a skin tint it
is absolutely beautiful it reflects
light in all the right ways you can put
it on before foundation during
foundation or after oh we are absolutely
in love so I'm going to apply this all
over the cheekbones center of the
forehead and chin wherever you want
light to reflect then we are going in
with a new foundation you guys are
actually the ones who told me that I
need this in my life and you were
correct so this is this Chanel lift
Lumiere it is such a beautiful medium to
full coverage foundation and I'm going
to use as always my Sigma f80 kabuki
brush and as you can see I am pressing
this into the skin once again like we
press the primer into the skin this will
just help it last the longest and it'll
give a nice dewy glow so just pressing
all over the face as you can see it's a
little bit darker but it does match my
neck which is what I want to match then
we are going in with Mac Pro Longwear
concealer and I am using shade and w20
I'm just going to dab this on the skin
with my fingers going all the way back
towards the temple area and then
grabbing the Sigma F 86 brush and
blending this out this is not
technically a concealer brush but I just
recommend that everyone uses it for
concealer because it is absolutely
beautiful don't forget to also run over
the eyes to prime the eyes for the
shadow that we will be going in with I
also slightly go over my eye brows it
doesn't really matter but it can help to
prime the eye brows as well speaking of
brows boom done I did use the Anastasia
caramel and ash blonde to fill in and
then I'm going to go and sculpt again
with that Mac Pro Longwear concealer I
will put my full brow tutorial down
below in the description bar as always
for you I just like sculpting my brows I
like the way it looks just having a
little bit more defined another intense
right now but it'll all work out
using the anise
a contour contour kit in the banana
shade plan I already hit pan and the Mac
Pro emphasized powder what can I say
some things never change I'll be using
this powder forever using the Sigma
tapered highlighting brush I'm just
going to dab as you can see literally
dabbing motions I really prefer dabbing
when I'm setting my concealer as a post
to rubbing and sweeping it really
presses the powder into the skin and
keeps the concealer in place all day
long I never have an issues my concealer
breaking up at all then going in with
the Mac this is Mac mineralized loose
powder who couldn't remember that for a
second I'm going to just dab this on my
t-zone because I have an issue with my
makeup breaking up in my t-zone because
I make so many facial expressions hmm
who would have thought then I'm going to
kick it old school and use Mac soft
brown today for my eyes I'm going in
with a sigma e40 brush which is just a
big fat blending brush and I'm going all
the way from inner corner to outer
corner as you can see I'm not putting it
all over the lid I am starting deep down
in the crease and working my way up so
we are just going to blend blend blend
and don't forget to practice patience
while blending because it's definitely
going to come in handy so just keep
going all the way from err corner and
outer corner making it as dark as you
please I've also done this look using a
bronzer instead of an eyeshadow and it's
just as beautiful then we're going in
with Mac texture it's a Mac day what can
I say whoo points for me for that rhyme
going again an inner corner and the
outer corner as you can see I'm leaving
the ball of the eye blank you don't have
to you can just continue to get this all
over the eyelid but I'm just leaving the
center of my eye with not much on it
just focusing on the inner and outer
corner then make sure you go back and
blend that out once again again again
blend blend blend blend blend then we
are going in with Becca highlighter in
opal oh I've been seeing the praises of
this highlighter for a while now I just
love it you can use any brush I'm using
the Mac 252 brush tapping this all over
the center of that lid which is why I
left it blank and then as you come to
the outer parts just start to lightly
blend it outward once you don't have as
much pigment on that brush using mac
fix+
to just dampen the brush to make it more
intense you can use eye drops for this
water won't really work with eyedrops
will you can wet any shimmery eyeshadow
max don't work but any shimmery
eyeshadow will become more metallic and
give more of a finish or a foiled
application when you wet it with fix+ so
I'm just dabbing that right on the
center just for a little bit more
intensity then going in with Mac nylon
such a beautiful highlight it's a yellow
base make sure you are right-handed with
it because it is a very very intense
highlight but as you can see it's
absolutely gorgeous so just a tiny bit
will go a very long way you can see I
absolutely love love love this highlight
then I'm going to curl my lashes very
lightly and yes very lightly because we
are going to use false lashes so you
want to make sure that curl is not too
intense otherwise it's going to be very
hard to get false lashes on I am putting
a coat of Giorgio Armani eyes to kill
this is still my sample size oh my god
i'm psalm says i love it then we are
going to pop on a pair of lashes these
are by SCE toh they are mink lashes
which looks so natural and beautiful it
is not always easy to wear false lashes
without eyeliner but if you get it close
enough to that lash line and you're very
patient you can do it and it will look
beautiful as you can see i'm squeezing
just to make sure that there's no
separation and boom beautiful just make
sure that you get those tweezers in
there and really squeeze that false lash
with that natural lash obviously beware
of your skin but it will just keep it
super super low so that you don't have
any separation between your naturals and
your falsies then we are going to just
go in with any pencil brush and blending
texture underneath that eyelid starting
in the outer corner i always like to
start in the outer corner because i like
the most intensity to be in the outer
corner if you don't want the most
intense thing at a corner you can start
in the inner corner just once again
don't forget to blend so many clients
for the past few years have always had
issues with their under eye area because
they just don't like to spend time under
there blending so just don't give up
keep blending back and forth constantly
and i'm going in with a smaller more
precise brush just putting more of that
texture shade just more densely up in
those lashes just to fill them in so
there
no gaps or separation then in the inner
corner going in with nylon again just to
highlight you can see this highlight is
amazing so we have the highlight on the
inner corner follow the eye and on the
brow bone so those three areas of
highlight on the eye really are very
flattering on everyone then going in
with NARS long wearing eyeliner and rue
Bonaparte which is this beautiful nude
that I go back to every single spring
and summer I'm going to just line my
waterline I'm not going to show you me
doing this for a very long time
just because my allergies have been off
the chain and my eyes are so red right
now I really don't watch myself do this
forever either moving on we're going to
just mascara the lower lashes and I feel
like it's very important to put on a
generous amount of mascara on the lower
lashes when doing a look like this with
a nude liner in the waterline and false
lashes and sneeze boom
eyeliner ruined Oh sad day so I'm going
to show you how we can clean this up
wait about 40 to 60 seconds and then get
a q-tip and just wipe and literally it
will just come off like a chalkboard
like it never even happened
do not try to take off any wet mascara
or eyeliner wait until it's dry then
going in with studio care blend pressed
powder this is in shade medium deep
because I'm pretty fair right now I'm
gonna just grab a big fat brush I don't
know the number of this one I will list
it below for you and I'm just going to
bronze the face we are not doing any
contouring we are just bronzing but it's
pretty much the exact same thing as
contouring just not precise we're just
going to bronze the cheeks right
underneath of the cheekbone area on the
temples around the forehead bottom part
of the chin we just want to give a
really beautiful sunkissed glow to the
entire face make sure you don't put a
lot on your forehead or nose you want to
leave that area blank so just the outer
part then kick in it old-school going in
with Mac peaches blush if you guys have
been a loyal follower of mine from the
beginning you know I used to be obsessed
with matte peaches I actually think I've
gone through three of these blushes
which is the most I've ever gone through
a blush all my years working at Mac I
put this on everyone who walked into the
store so I'm just going to blend this
with a Mac 129 into my bronzer going
backward even
doesn't even though it doesn't have a
sheen or shimmer in it it really gives a
beautiful glow to the face complement so
many people everyone thinks it looks
scary in person until you put it on it
is such a gorgeous color I use it every
spring and summer moving on going back
with the Becca highlighter and opal we
are going to use these Sigma tapered
highlighter brush once again and just
dust this all over the top of that
cheekbone bringing up to the side kind
of by the eyebrow that will give a
really beautiful glow especially when
you're turning your face from side to
side make sure that you do a light
amount of this you do not want to be too
generous with this because it is a very
intense highlighter and then on the chin
Cupid's bow and of course in the center
of that nose you do not have to do all
that if you don't want to look super
glowy but I love lighting up like a
disco ball then we're going in with a
Nastasia clear brow gel just so that our
brow hairs are not flapping all over our
face throughout the day because mine
will fall and look like a hot mess and
there's this there's just nothing worse
okay really firstworldproblems then we
are going to go in with Mac Japanese
maple I am using all my old staples
today I just love love this color it is
such a beautiful nude and you can finish
it like this and just do a super nude
lip which of course totally gorge but
instead we are going to go on top of
that with the new Mac mineralized gloss
and be nice which is such a pretty coral
rosy shade I absolutely love these
formulas they're such great glosses so
just mixing that is going to give me a
nice glossy nude coral shade absolutely
perfect so that completes our look I
hope you guys enjoy thank you so much

I'll see you soon bye
