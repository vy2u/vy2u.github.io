so I know it's been forever since I made
a video I've been moving into my new
apartment and decorating so it's been a
little chaotic but I'm finally in and I
feel like this is like growing out of
the back of my head as I'm speaking to
you but whatever anyways um so yeah I
gotten a few messages here on YouTube
asking me to do a look with hot pink
lips
I know I did like the Kardashian look a
while back but I guess you guys wanted
more for spring and summertime so this
is what I did it's um just a neutral
look with pink lips and I did a really
bold brow because bold brows are really
in right now and I'm like obsessed and
it's hard not to take it too far
easy hard hard
oh God Oh anyways so this is the look I
came up with
I have false eyelashes on because
whenever I make these videos I just feel
like I have to put false lashes on and
the mirror I'm like oh no I'm not gonna
put lashes on but then I look in the
camera and I'm like I look awful I don't
want you guys to things like my makeup a
Sidious look what's the point of the
video anyways um just keep watching okay
so first I am taking this big brush and
it has vanilla eyeshadow on it it's a
velvet eyeshadow so it's not shimmery
but it's not totally matte and I'm using
this because I'm gonna be using a
shimmery color all over my lid and I
don't want to be too much shimmer now
I'm taking the shadow hey by Mac this
was a limited edition um it's a lot like
naked pigment the only reason I'm using
it is because it is so similar to my
skin tone and in this look the color
should be very similar to your skin tone
you could do with a matte shade I just
like the shimmer especially this time of
year now I'm taking the color Samoas
silk um I don't have a picture of it but
it's like an orange II yellowy medium
tone it works just the same way as like
soft Brown does in a sense that it's
just going to be your medium color to
blend darker shade we're going to use
into the highlight now I'm using texture
I believe I've used this before in a
previous video it's my favorite color
by
um it's like a warm tone with red
undertones in it then putting that like
in the depths of my crease and I'm
blending it up and I'm not being too
precise as you can see I'm working
rather quickly because I'm gonna prone
false lashes I can be a little bit more
sloppy with this in a way because the
false lashes is going to help bring that
color down so I can take it up a little
bit farther and I'm going back with that
same brush with nothing on it and just
blending it out you can put more Samoas
silk on it or going with like soft brown
or just a medium tone and it'll help
blend it out now I'm doing my eyeliner
I'm using gel and this isn't even Mac
this is actually Maybelline it's like
called eye studio or something it's so
amazing I'm addicted to this eye liner I
absolutely love it
um giving myself just like a little wing
I'm not doing too thick of a line or too
thin this might be thick for you but
it's not for me that's on the thin side
umm just enough to put lashes on and you
don't have to do lashes with this look I
mean the only reason I really did it is
just because I felt like it looked kind
of incomplete without it on camera but
yes so I'm now doing my foundation and I
do not know why my skin looks so pink on
the camera and my foundation looks so
yellow but I promise this foundation
does match me and I'm also sorry that
I'm so sumed in I'm getting used to this
um editing program that I'm using and it
is not so cute but my other videos I
won't be so zoomed in my promise um
I'm using a concealer this is the Select
cover-up concealer by Mac and I'm using
it on a natural hair brush because I
want it to be a little on the sheer side
and then I'm blending it in with my
fingers because when it comes to
concealer that is my favorite tool to
use the warmth of your finger will just
blend it so much more beautifully and
smoothly than any brush well as you can
see I'm dabbing not actually rubbing
because if you rub it's just going to go
right on your finger and take out your
face
now I'm going in with a brush and I'm
using max mineral skin finish in the
color light I'm using light because I
want my concealer to be lighter than the
rest of my face some people don't do
this I do it helps open up your eyes
helps give you more like a fresh look um
and especially in the daytime it'll
really just make you pop a little bit
more some people don't like it I do now
I'm filling in my brows and I'm using
cork by Mac that's the shade I'm using
I'm doing a little bit of a bolder brow
today so I'm bringing that shade all the
way in normally I wouldn't bring it in
quite that far and quite that blunt but
today I am because I love love this
really bold brow trend that is going
around right now
um it's easy to get carried away there's
a few times I've done my brows and sat
back and been like oh my god this is
awful
I have worms on my face I'm I'm using
clear brow gel you can get it anywhere
and I'm just going in and just making
sure that my eyebrows don't stray away
because they go crazy and then I'm
popping on some false lashes which you
can barely see because I'm so zoomed in
and I'm sorry but it is what it is I'm
putting on some false lashes look at
that there is my eye that is really
gross
and I'm using mascara which is an
absolute must like if you're gonna put
on false lashes do not neglect your
natural ones
seriously put on mascara it will change
everything
okay I'm bronzing I am NOT contouring I
am bronzing so I'm just going crazy I'm
putting it a little under the cheekbone
a little on top I'm bringing it around
the side of my face up on my forehead
the whole shebang
now honestly for a daytime look you
could just put on like a clear gloss and
be done um but I'm gonna go in with
blush and I'm gonna do a bright lip and
I'm gonna put some shadow onto my eyes
because this is more of like a late
afternoon evening look for me I'm using
the blush cantaloupe it's a MacPro color
I'm putting it on the apples of my
cheeks and bringing it down just a
little bit and blending it into my
bronzer I'm doing this because I don't
really want a baby doll look but I want
it to stay in line with the whole
bronzing color and then I'm going back
and I'm covering up my glue because even
though makeup artists will tell you that
it dries clear it doesn't it's lies
don't believe it please go and cover up
your eyeliner it will make the world of
difference and I'm using um impassioned
lipstick by Mac and this is a very hot
hot pink it's a little on the warm side
you might not see it in the video but it
is on the warm side if you hold it next
like a true cool tone blue pink it's my
favorite color though is so pretty and
I'm taking um this color that's a lot
like texture but a little lighter and
it's called one to watch it's a pro
longwear shade and I'm putting it on
under my eyes and just blending it out
once again if this is like a morning or
early afternoon or your going to work
you can skip the false lashes and skip
the shadow under the eye and just do
mascara and you're done but I didn't
want to just leave it that I wanted to
just give myself a little extra
something
so I'm putting mascara on my bottom
eyelashes and you can see the difference
that makes for me um after this you're
done so I hope you enjoyed okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
