did this makeup look using Browns and
gold more like champagne and browns kind
of geared towards prom since we are
going to be coming across that season
soon but I think this is one of the
prettiest like girliest looks that there
really is I absolutely love it
it's gorgeous you can wear it daytime
you can wear it nighttime the first
thing I'm doing is taking a concealer
and I'm putting it all over my eyes now
I'm using this as a base for my eye
shadow but I'm very dry now if you're
more oily you tend to crease easy on the
eyelids then I would suggest a Paint Pot
or primer potion next I'm taking all
that glitters by Mac it's a really
pretty like champagne frosty shade and
I'm going to keep it all over the bottom
portion of my eyelid umm you can take
this into the crease you can bring it a
little bit above if you want it's such a
gorgeous neutral shade it really looks
beautiful on everybody with every skin
tone unless you're extremely dark in
tone this is just such a beautiful
fallback color for me I really cannot
live without it umm and then next I'm
going to take the shade texture it's
like a warm warm brown that has a little
bit of sparkle in it nothing that you
can really see though on a fluffy brush
and I'm just putting buffing it into my
crease and as you can see I'm not going
really far into the inner corner and I'm
not going really deep down into that
outer crease I'm just kind of staying
right above my crease and up and just
bringing it towards the brow then I'm
going to take Swiss chocolate which is
another warm shade because this is like
a warm toned smokey ish eye taking that
on a more stiff brush and I'm putting
that lower in my crease so it's kind of
like a gradient you know you want it to
be like the light champagne color and
then that darker color in the crease
kind of faded up into that warm light
brown it's kind of like a wave of
neutrals across the eye
and I'm just taking a little bit more
texture on that brush and just dusting
it into that crease after I'm putting
this deep down in there and once again
as you can see I have my brush turned
sideways because if I have it turned the
other way it's going to put that Swiss
chocolate too far up in my crease so
having it turn sideways like this is
going to keep it low and kind of
eliminate lines and then I'm going back
in with that texture just fluffing it
over top just to keep it light I'm now
applying eyeliner and I'm going to do a
little bit of a wing today umm I'm
pulling my eyelid taunt even though I
shouldn't but I'm doing it because it
makes it easier especially when I'm
doing the wing just to get it on there
and get it out um just makes it a lot
faster so no judgement um but I'm using
black track by Mac the same gel liner
that I always use nothing special
nothing's changed and I want this to be
kind of thick but once we get on the
lashes I'm going to apply false lashes
and then I'm going to go back and I'm
going to thicken it out and blacken it
even more so it'll be a little bit more
dramatic than it is right now I'm
applying these our red cherry lashes
number 46 I believe 43 they're number 43
um yeah I'm just applying them I'm using
a tweezer kind of freaks me out just
watching it right now oh my god okay
then I'm going back over the lashes with
that same black track gel liner and I'm
just gonna make it darker and thicker
and this is going to change your look so
much it's gonna give your eyes like that
top-heavy look which is going to look at
smokey oh look at the difference oh my
gosh look at the difference that's
insane I love it
okay so I'm just doing the exact same
thing to this eye
I'm just deepening that black and making
a little bit thicker because I don't
want that line to be too thin otherwise
you'll be able to see my lashes I'm
tight lining underneath the top room of
my eye just getting in there because
that once again will make that top line
that lash line look darker and thicker
and more edgier and blacker so it'll
bring more attention to that area and I
really want that heavy eye look on top
and then more light on bottom
I've shown this before I'm just putting
mascara on my actual lashes just to kind
of blend the natural ones and the fake
ones together next I'm going to be
applying foundation I'm using this
synthetic kabuki brush just to rub it in
and I'm using Studio sculpt by Mac and I
like drenched my brush with fix+ and so
I'm just massaging this all over my face
so that it's really light and
moisturizing so I'm super dry right now
and I cannot do anything about it it's
horrible and then I'm applying this
concealer this is the mineralized
concealer it's new just came out a
couple weeks ago I'm using it in shade
NW 15 which is super light and I'm
putting that under my eyes and then I'm
blending it in with my fingers because
the warmth of my fingers blends better
than any brush there's no brush out
there that I have found that can do my
concealer as good as my fingers can the
warmth just makes it blend so
beautifully and I can just do whatever I
want with it and manipulate it and
sculpt it and a tip when you're doing
your concealer don't do it I'm doing
blend from your outer corner to your
inner corner with your finger and that
is actually going to eliminate creasing
in your little fine lines look at the
difference between my right eye and my
left eye that's amazing but yeah so I'm
out by the winged eyeliner if you kind
of DAB it inwards it'll make it so that
it doesn't settle any fine lines and now
I am using this stiff little brush from
Mac to fill up my eyebrows I'm using the
eye shadow color cork this is a really
common color for eyebrow filling and
then I'm using the spool this one is
from Mac but you can get them anywhere
they're really cheap and I'm just using
this just to go through and kind of
fluff it around because it'll just help
like air out my eyebrows and not be like
really super defined when I'm using that
falsies mascara I don't know what brand
it's from this is nylon eyeshadow I'm
dabbing it in the inner rim of my inner
corner of my eye in a room of my inner
corner of my inner eye just to bring
some lights to that area draw more
attention to my eyes since I'm not
lining my waterline at the bottom which
you can do and I'm using medium dark
powder by Mac this isn't
mineral powder just to kind of sculpt my
face very lightly I would not call this
bronzing at all because it's extremely
light I'm just using it to contour just
a little bit just to give some
definition and then this blush is called
style and it's like an orange II Coralie
pinky blush and I'm going to put that on
the apples of my cheeks and then I'm
taking soft and gentle by Mac and I'm
also taking nylon the same eye shadows
before mixing them together to highlight
the tops of my cheekbones just to bring
more attention to that I area so pretty
I'm taking that same color and I'm
highlighting my Cupid's bow and then I'm
going to take not that pink one even
though it's beautiful I'm not going to
use it using innocence beware because I
know how you girls going to prom and
love your new black</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
