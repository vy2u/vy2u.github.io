a video all about the new makeup geek
blushes they just came out earlier this
week and I'm super excited to be doing
this video it was very highly requested
to to do it but I was going to do it
anyways I'm just I'm so excited all
these blushes I've been anticipating the
arrival these blushes for so long and
I'm just a mega big fan I love makeup
geek I love Marlena
if you don't know Marlena is a creator
of makeup geek and she does have a
channel of her own here on YouTube I'll
link her down below or you can just type
in makeup geek she was actually the
first person I ever saw in history of
time doing makeup tutorials on YouTube
my mom ran and grabbed me I was like
Jacqueline there's this girl on YouTube
that's doing makeup I was like oh so
yeah I just love Marlena so I'm just
gonna talk with the blushes now she did
come out with 13 fabulous colors they
are all very different from one another
they're so beautiful so this is 11 right
here and then the other two the add to
13 are here in these compacts so if you
buy them in the palette they are $9.99
so let's just say ten bucks and then for
the compacts I do not know the price but
I'm sure it's a dollar two more just
because you have to pay for packaging if
you are not sure if you want to get in
the palette form of the container form I
always suggest get it in the palette
form because it's just so much more user
friendly it's all right here when you
travel you can just take things out
there all magnetic move it to pallets
put shadows in with it and it's just so
easy and compact as opposed to rummaging
through compacts and things like this so
that's just me personal also this
palette that I have right here is a Z
Pro palette as opposed to the normal
ones that are this size right here this
is a Mac Daddy compared to this one so
see palos do come in all different forms
I'll link down below where you can find
Z palettes and all that I'll link every
single thing I talked about below in
this video also really quickly presently
like mention my background in my last
video I got so many comments when you
guys say it you love my new background
this is just like the opposite side of
my room and I wasn't planning on this
being like my new official background
but I'm honestly just so sick of being
shoved in that corner over there that I
just wanted to change it up for just a
minute and sit in front of this vanity
because I feel much more open to my room
and not like
sitting the corner it just felt like I
was cramping my style and I was just
losing inspiration and I don't really
like the way that corner is decorated to
begin with I want to redo it in the next
couple of weeks so I'm just sitting here
because I just I feel very much more
open I can see my entire makeup room I
feel very more refreshed and just Zen so
anyway this is not supposed to take my
official background but if you guys like
it then I can kind of go back and forth
let me know if you hate it then I can go
back to the corner okay so let's get
into these blushes I'm just going to go
through them not any particular order
anything and I'm going to show you
exactly what the colors are and talk
about the textures and all that jazz you
can decide if you want to go ahead and
purchase something for your stuff so the
first color I'm going to talk about
right here is one of my absolute
favorites but that's just because I
gravitate towards anything coral or
peachy or anything like that this one
right here is called bliss this is such
a perfect true peach shade that is it a
matte blush it does not have any shimmer
in it but for some reason when it's on
the cheeks it just makes you look like
you are glowing from within it's very
hard to explain but it's just the exact
color of peach that they created it to
be it just makes you look so glowy it's
absolutely beautiful if you like peach
bliss is your blush my grandma would
love this color she's obsessed peach
this is called summer fling I'll show
you it next to bliss as you can see that
bliss is so much more peach and this is
way more orange I absolutely love love
love summer fling this is the first one
that I gravitated to soon as I saw this
palette these I love anything that has
orange in it I love that intense strong
coral are you kidding mm-hmm yeah I'm
obsessed so as you can see this color is
extremely pigmented it is not chalky
whatsoever it goes on so smooth but
again this is totally matte this is
going to be so beautiful on anyone who
has a slight tan in the summertime
especially if you seem to be a little
bit of bronzer or very light contour and
then put this on the Apple the cheeks
I'm so excited about this color I think
it's my favorite in the entire palette
so that is summer fling some fling I'm
just going to knock out all the warm
shades first because that's how its laid
out my palate warmed cool tone so we're
going to keep going down the warm train
and we will hit cool tones next and this
next one is called smitten this is
described on the website as eight
l creamy Africa I believe and that's
exactly what it is it is such a perfect
apricot shade it's just going to warm
you up and again make the cheeks look so
summery and just like you're glowing but
without adding any shimmer so beautiful
I love this color this blush right here
is next in line for my favorite in the
palette and this is infatuation this
again is a matte shade and it is a very
deep terracotta warm color I absolutely
love this as soon as I put this palette
this was just one of them that also go
depending on your skin tone you can use
this as a blush a bronzer or contour
shade it is just so beautiful so
Universal this is a shade that pretty
much everybody can own and you can make
it work somehow I love that it's matte
and it doesn't have shimmer in it
because you can mix it in with your
bronzer and it's just it's beautiful for
summertime
are you ready and I'll be ready for it I
love you ready board this one is so
beautiful this is the shade or romance
and I have to say that I think this it
did my top three but it might be my
number one just because of the beautiful
shimmer that is in this blush star my
hair is all up in my face this is so
gorgeous and it's so creamy it is insane
like it I'm not swatch on the back of my
hand like gives me goose bumps like I
cannot even deal as soon as I tried it I
thought okay this is so similar to NARS
orgasm but even prettier even creamier
and even more buttery and more pigmented
so orgasm on steroids if you guys aren't
familiar to that it should be called
orgasm on steroids so pigmented it has
an underlying gold shimmer in it it is
just so amazing I am wearing this right
now on my cheeks mix them with another
blush I'm going to be showing just a
second especially for summertime if you
don't want to just do a highlight on the
cheekbones you just take a little bit of
that put it on the cheeks and just like
Oh such a beautiful glow so it's a depth
but I'm Way too excited I came to get my
words out this is the other blush that I
am wearing today mix in with romance on
my cheeks and this is called spellbound
this right here I really don't have much
to say about it other than it is
extremely anniversa l-- and it's a blush
that nobody can hate like it's not too
pink and it's not too orange it's not
too warm it's not too cool it's right in
between it's really going to look
beautiful and absolutely everybody it's
just a gorgeous blush and I really don't
know anyone who has a blush extremely
similar to this this is very different
in the blush cosmetic industry
me I don't know what it is about this
specific one but whenever I dip my brush
into it it's like it just goes so far it
is so highly pigmented so I love this
and again I have that and romance mixed
on my cheeks right now for this little
situation this next one right here it is
called honeymoon and it's the only one
I'm not like oh my gosh I just love this
because it's just not one of those
blushes I personally gravitate towards
but it is going to be great for those of
you who let's say are very fair and
skinned and you like that light like
frosty pink with a little bit of glitter
in it it has little tiny flecks of
glitter it is super pigmented just like
the rest of them it's just not my
personal cup of tea but for someone out
there who is extremely fair or more warm
and tone this will be beautiful on you
this is a love affair this is such a
beautiful bright midtone pink shade it
is just so universal honestly this is a
color that the palest the darkest of
girls can all wear it's just so gorgeous
but it can be so intimidating because
it's so bright and so many people just
neglect it because honestly like whoa
that's intense and that can be kind of
scary but what you want to do is just
take a natural hair brush like this a
white hair brush and just literally tap
it like pink and then go in and just
sweep it around the cheek area and it's
not going to be overly pigmented it's
not going to look like that you're not
going to look at the clown it's
literally just going to make the cheeks
come alive it's going to give the face
like and it's just going to look so
fresh and feminine in summary I'm having
a love affair with love affair
this next blush right here is called
head-over-heels and this has a shimmer
in it this blush right here just takes
me back to like 2008-2009 because these
are the types of blushes that I just
absolutely loved the undertone this
reminds me of the shade well-dressed
iMac but it has such a gorgeous shimmer
and it is so pretty so if you like your
cool toned blushes this is absolutely
gorgeous
this again you could wear a blush and
then take this and let me dust it over
and it's just going to make it come
alive and really make it pop since it
has a beautiful shimmer effect this
right here is called secret admirer and
this one reminds me so much of the Nicki
Minaj - lipstick that came out from Mac
this honestly just in this color screams
Nicki Minaj to me in general because
it's just
color that she always wears lips blush
shadows all of the above is that lilac
purple color but it's going to be a
color that you can wear easily because
of the fact that it still has some pink
undertones in it but it's so fun so
again you can apply this very lightly
and it's not going to come off like
purple on the cheeks and this is also
something that I would recommend not
using a lot of bronzer or contour with
sometimes I go in with color like this
with absolutely no bronzer and contour
just on the apples of the cheeks for
just a little bit of that summertime
glow
this is rendezvous I am so so excited
about the shade I have not worn out of
my own cheeks I have just swatch it and
I'm so in love with it and excited to
try it this blush is honestly going to
look so gorgeous on those of you with
very dark skin it is so pigmented so
creamy and is a matte shade it is just
like a straight up purple honestly but
it has a beautiful pink undertone in it
that's a cool tone it's just freaking
gorgeous I'm so excited about this it's
so different I have never seen a blush
color like this I don't think ever my
life so I'm pumped about rendezvous so
that completes the palette and now I'm
going to show you the two containers so
the first one I have in a container is
called first love it looks like this
right here and it is very very light in
shape this is a very very light almost
pale lavender it almost has some white
undertones in it this is a shade that
anyone who has a bit of a tan is got to
be careful applying because it can make
them look a little bit ashy and stand
out in kind of a negative way but what I
love about this is that she really did
create this for those girls who are this
very fair have a hard time finding a
beautiful blush on them I think it's
really cool that she honestly created so
many blushes for so many different skin
tones last but not least we have the
blush hanky panky which i think is such
a cute name and the blush itself is
absolutely beautiful this is a bright
cool tone pink it reminds me so much of
Barbie in such a good positive way it is
just so great I'm so excited to try this
and again you guys don't be scared these
bright colors I know from working at Mac
all those years women come in and look
at these bright colors and they're like
oh god no thank you
but once you just try it on with just a
light
dust on the cheeks it just makes the
face come alive it is just so beautiful
and the great thing about these bright
image sand blushes they truly look good
on the palest to the darkest we can all
wear them which makes it so Universal
all right you guys
complete this video I have to say I'm so
impressed by makeup geek blushes they're
so absolute beautiful they're so
pigmented they're so blendable the best
part about it is that there is a shade
in here for every single skin tone which
is just awesome so I hope that you guys
enjoy all links will be in the
description bar as always thank you so
much for watching you guys I love you so
much and I'll be seeing you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
