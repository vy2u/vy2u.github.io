something really different here on my
channel but it was really highly
requested so I kind of like took it as a
sign like okay so maybe you should just
do it how many you guys have asked for a
first impression slash review on the new
wise self foundation this is the the
fuse fusion ink foundation I'm sorry I'm
still in my pajamas because it's been
one of those days where I woke up and
I've been cleaning and organizing and
just doing stuff all around the house
and I'm realizing like I haven't had any
human interaction like my husband's been
gone he's been working and doing stuff
and so I've been alone and so now that
I'm talking for the first time today
like it's kind of weird hearing my voice
is that just me or does that happen to
anybody else you yeah okay whatever
moving on so I'm looking at the
description of this foundation right now
online and it says it it's a
revolutionary fine is Inc foundation
with SPF 18 that perfects the skin while
it wears weightlessly for 24 hours
that's intense it says you can get
all-day comfort with a soft matte finish
it is very lightweight it's for every
skin type and it has a technology that
provides a lightweight yet high coverage
formula it's supposed to out stand
through humidity and sweat and it has a
dry oil complex that allows it to set in
seconds it's not supposed to get cakey
or heavy it's a medium coverage but it's
buildable to full coverage so this is
what the foundation looks like right
here it's all black and gold which is
why I love this packaging but the top of
it just pops straight off and then you
have this to twist open and you have a
doe foot applicator right here which is
the only thing that I'm not really crazy
about I didn't I can live through it
though I'm not going to complain I'm not
crazy about those kind of applicators
though I definitely prefer a pump
because it's just less hassle in less
time and sometimes the doffo applicators
can spread some bacteria but that's okay
we'll make it work so I'm going to be
applying this using my makeup geek
foundation stippling brush hmmm I love
this brother I'm going to warn you right
off the bat this foundation is going to
be darker than my face but it's
hopefully going to match my nap because
if you can tell my face is very fair
compared to my neck area so I always try
to match my neck as opposed to this I
don't know how I want to apply this I
don't know if I want to like put this on
my face if I want to like dump someone
back my hand I don't know
ah forget it my face is clean I'll just
put directly on my skin I never applied
foundation like this mmm it smells like
why I said so I'm starting with a little
bit just to see if this color
oh sweet this color is going to work oh
my god the way it goes into your skin is
just like so like way so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to dump a little bit
back my hand because this doe foot
applicator is just not giving me life
right now so this is how I'm going to be
applying it because that's just me
I've never ever used a foundation that's
felt like this before this just feels
seriously so lightweight and it has like
a oh my gosh this is like I can't
explain this this is like a very strange
foundation for me to do as a first
impressions video because it is cannot
explain it in this feels velvet if it
literally feels like you're just like
touching like velvet dress that's how
this foundation no joke feels like
velvet so it's definitely matte I cannot
get over the way this feels like usually
when you're applying a foundation like
just like this and not touching with
your fingers you can't really feel the
texture of it but you honestly can it
feels like I'm rubbing velvet all over
my skin so I will say that you have to
really pack a lot of this on in order
okay not that much you have to really
pack a lot of this on to get a full
coverage that's what you're going for
I'm going to get my nails done today I
don't talk about it I'm going to go in
and do the rest of my makeup and then
I'll come back in a couple of hours
right now it is 2 o'clock and I got a
lot of text waiting for me I'll be back
in a little bit after I've done the rest
of my makeup to show you guys how it's
held up alright so I am back and it is
6:38 as you can see so I've been wearing
this foundation now for a couple of
hours and I have to say I really really
like this foundation yes I am wearing
great lipstick by the way for those of
you who are like why not so I find this
foundation cohn for a few out for a few
hours now so far so good
I really really do love this foundation
so I'm not picking my nose it's a niche
I will say that for me personally this
is not going to want to be this is not
going to be one of my go-to foundations
because I personally like dewy
foundations but since I have worked with
so many different skin types I can tell
you this is a great foundation overall
it is beautiful I would say it mimics
the look of skin it's very soft it's
very velvety it lays beautifully on the
skin the only issue is that it is kind
of accentuating my dry areas it's not
accentuate enlike any blemishes but the
dry areas it's kind of clinging on to
them that's my only complaint my friend
who is very oily she loved this she
tried a couple days ago which she wore
all day and she said that she really
loved it and when she came over to my
house that night she was not oily so for
those of you who are really oily you'll
probably love this foundation me being
dry it's not like oh my gosh I love this
it's so beautiful I look really dewy and
hydrated but I will say it looks pretty
it lays beautifully it's nice it's soft
it feels very very weightless but I will
zoom you in so you can see where I'm
talking about I don't know if the camera
is going to pick it up or not but right
in between my eyebrows I have really dry
skin right now from this sunless tanner
that my skin didn't like and if you can
see the foundation is clinging on to
that and just kind of accentuating it
and making it a little bit worse looking
I'm going to check in with you guys in a
couple hours again before the day is
over since this is a 24 hour where I'm
going to wear
long as it possibly can so I will come
back to some point before I go to bed so
I'll see you later all right so it is
now 10:30 9 p.m. so I've had the
foundation on for about eight eight
eight and a half I don't remember when I
actually sat down and filmed I feel like
it's in between eight nine hours I've
had it on for so a full day wear a
foundation um I should have filmed this
video earlier but I didn't know that I
was going to and should have started it
earlier this morning but I would have to
say overall this foundation is really
really beautiful it honestly mimics skin
for those of you who are very dry to the
point that you have like flakes in your
skin or like some rough patches I would
not recommend this to you but those who
are more normal to oily I would
definitely say try this out because it
really does lay beautifully you can see
them close that it honestly still looks
pretty much the exact same as it did
when I first applied it and I have not
done any touch-ups to either like I
haven't gone over a second time or
reapplied it in any way I have not
touched my face since I applied the
foundation eight and a half hours ago so
yeah
I am done for the night I hope that you
guys enjoy I'm going to take a shower
wash my hair and watch me some Chuck and
Blair oh all right I'm out love you guys
bye
her fracks strange because i her I'm
about a snitch a bitch because I'm gray
isn't it
BAE BAE BAE Merryman then this this
specific effect the person in their own
little personal Sh
Oh a full video review using app I've
done that the only thing worse the
lipstick on your teeth is gray lipstick
on your cheek apply it to the face for
weight wet Russian right now this
foundation and it says that it's a root
roof mmm
that is an intense description right

crepes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
