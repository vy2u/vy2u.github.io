Oh
hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
my official New Year's Eve makeup
tutorial I know this was coming like
really last minute but this of course
does not have to just be worn on New
Year's Eve this can be worn all year
round like any look it's just makeup um
I would definitely recommend this for a
girls night out
weekend look going to a party or Monday
afternoon to get lunch like whatever you
please so I am super excited because not
only is this my favorite look that I've
ever done like I'm not kidding ooh this
is seriously my favorite look I've ever
done here by YouTube but it's cool tones
which is I tweeted just a couple days
ago that my New Year's resolution is
that I want to start wearing more cool
tone colors which I was partially
kidding the totally series at the same
time you know um I already started
buying like silver accessories he's like
okay this year I'm going to start
wearing more silver I'm going to start
wearing more cool toned blushes more
cool toned eyeshadows I just I'm such a
warm person like the way I dress and do
my makeup and my hair everything is warm
but it's funny because my house and like
my home decor is all silvers and grays
and whites but yet like me I'm always
like gold and Dorgan teas and oranges so
I want to start wearing more cool tones
to kind of around myself out as a human
being so yeah that is just like my silly
little side note of a New Year's
resolution I also have a personal
resolution as well which is going to be
I want to try to not be as hard on
myself in the Year 2015 I am very very -
extremely hard myself to the point that
everyone in my life is always telling me
like knocking off Jacqueline stop being
so high on yourself it's ridiculous and
so this year I'm going to really try to
make a conscious effort to stop being so
hard myself and just let myself breathe
and let myself relax and just like admit
to myself like everything is going to be
okay you're not ever going to be perfect
and that is just fine so that is my
personal New Year's resolution I would
love it if you guys would share with me

much for being with me thank you so much
for watching this video I love you guys
and I'll see you next year bye okay
let's do this my eyes are already primed
and I'm going to start off with makeup
geek Barcelona Beach which is just a
great cool tone Brown perfect for the
transition color on our crease I'm using
an e 40 brush by Sigma to blend this
back and forth and I'm putting this
pretty much all over the lid but I'm not
taking it too far into the inner corner
then I'm going to go in with m6 2-0
which is a dark very pigmented gray
shadow by makeup forever I'm using an
e25 brush from Sigma to put this only on
the outer corner I'm literally going to
just put the tiniest amount in the outer
corner and then just focus on blending
that outward because this is so
intensely pigmented I don't want the
outer corner of my eye to be super
intense because I don't want the top to
really be super smoky so I'm just
putting it in the outer corner and then
blending it out if you go back in with a
little bit more Barcelona Beach on your
brush that will really help out the
blending process which is what I'm doing
right now I have a little bit more of
that color and I'm going to go back and
forth and blend everything out and put a
little bit of that Barcelona Beach on
the lid as well as you can see me doing
just to kind of smooth everything over
so that nothing is too harsh then I'm
going to go in and do my eyeliner I'm
using a Maybelline gel eye liner in
blackest black this has been one of my
favorite eyeliners for ever and I am
going to do my eyeliner the same as I
always do so I start on the outer corner
I make a line from the outer corner of
my eye up at an angle towards the tail
of my brow
and I take that line all the way until
my inner corner and then I literally
just fill it in as you can see me doing
here I've been doing my liner like this
for quite some time and I absolutely
love it if you guys would like a
detailed tutorial on it let me know but
I kind of always try to show you guys
how I do it in my videos I think it is
the easiest way to do it so I'm just
going back and forth really blackening
them up and evening them out that way
they look symmetrical now for the fun
part I'm going to be going in with lit
cosmetics loose glitter in the shade
Sher oh my gosh this is the perfect New
Year's Eve glitter it's like a clear
crystal glitter with reflex of like
blues and purples oh my gosh it's
gorgeous
I'm going to be using the lit cosmetics
glitter adhesive as well so I just wet
my brush this is the same brush that is
sold on their website I think it is the
best for this and then I will dip that
brush right after dipping it in the base
I will dip it into the glitter and then
I will just go on with my bad self and
line the top of that liner now this is
not going to be easy-peasy
of course you're gonna be like I made a
mistake I messed up you know what I'm
saying like it's not going to be like a
smooth ride my right eye as you can see
I was pretty pleased it was so smooth
easy sailing but now my left eye because
I'm right-handed it made it a little bit
more tricky so I'm going to show you how
I messed up and how I fixed my mistakes
that way if you guys kind of make the
same mistakes as me you guys can fix
them as well so you can see here that it
kind of sloppy and then I got a chunk of
glitter all over my liner all I'm going
to do is go back with that exact same
liner brush this is the e what is this
this is the e65 from Sigma I'm going to
take a generous amount of that black gel
liner that we had in the first place and
all I'm going to do is go over that
liner and just remove and cover up that
glitter and you'll see how it's going to
go from choppy to completely smooth
again so just take a generous amount out
liner and clean that bad boy up so that
you have nice crisp flawless edges again
as you can see right here so then I'm
going to go in and just coat my upper
lashes with mascara it does not matter
what mascara you use because we're going
to be putting false lashes right on top
of it so any mascara will do today I'm
going to be going in with velour lashes
in the style lash in the city these are
very full very fluffy in the
outer corner of them had like a little
bit of like a flick like a little wing
just kind of accentuate that you know
liner cat eye wing situation that we
have going on and you can see the way
that looks and I always have to do an
interpretive dance after I apply my
first lash because it just feels so
satisfying like yes when I complete so
I'm going to pop on the other one and
then I'm going to go over the base of
that lash and cover up with gel liner I
make sure that I do this every single
time I put on false lashes because it'll
just make it so that when you look down
people are like oh hello false lash so
today I am going to be using a new
primer this is by Chanel this is the
sheer illuminating base primer I've been
on a primer kik recently and I've been
trying out so many and so I'm trying out
this one right now
I must say so far loving typical right
of course the primer that cost an arm
and a leg you like sell your soul for is
the one I love and then I'm going to go
in with NARS I believe this is the pro
line and pore filler and I'm going to be
putting this on the areas of my face
where my foundation tends to crease
because let's get real I like to make a
lot of facial expressions throughout my
day so I'm going to put it around my
lips in between my eyebrows and on my
forehead and I'm going to go in with
Make Up For Ever HD foundation I am in
shade one two three well technically my
face is probably like a shade zero or
negative zero negative one but my neck
is it shade number one two three and I'm
matching my face to my neck if I were to
match my foundation to my face
in the color that that is that would not
look cute so I always recommend matching
your foundation to your neck or your
forearm something that is not just your
face because if you just match your
foundation to your face sometimes your
body is a different color and then it
just looks very awkward and uneven so I
always recommend matching your
foundation to your body I am using f80
foundation brush from Sigma kicking it
old school this is still one of my
all-time favorite foundation brushes you
can't go wrong with it it's so great and
it blends everything out so fast then
I'm going to go in and conceal my under
eye the same way that I always do I'm
using Mac Pro Longwear concealer in nw20
5 I believe and I'm going to just buff
that out with a damp Beauty Blender I
always take my concealer down in a V
motion up towards my temples the reason
to do this is because it will just give
your face a little bit
of a lifted more sculpted look then I'm
going to go in and set everything I'm
going to mix
anastacio banana powder and Mac what is
this Mac Pro emphasize this is a shaping
powder I'm going to mix these two
together and then set my under eye
concealer and this will give a little
bit more of a highlight not too much
though I have to set my concealer or I
am a Creasy mess no matter what this is
a must for me then to even out that
highlight I'm going to put a little bit
of little bit of it on my chin my
Cupid's bow a little bit on the nose and
then a little bit on the forehead as
well I always recommend spreading out
your highlight on the high points of
your face because you just do it
underneath your eyes sometimes it can be
kind of like whoa what happened then I'm
going to go in and fill in my brows I'm
doing my brows a little bit differently
than I did when I did my most recent
updated brow routine I am using the
shade ash blonde which is weird I know
cuz I have red hair and I'm definitely
not blonde but I'm using ash blonde and
chocolate I kind of mix those two
together and I specifically use the
shade chocolate on the outer tail of my
brow and ash blonde towards the inner
corner I tried to go extremely light
handed and I make sure that I really
buff that out big-time with that spoolie
and then I will go in and shape it up I
always use a flat definer brush by Sigma
this is an e 15 to shape this up with
concealer and I make sure that I do not
use a concealer that's much darker than
I mean much lighter than my skin that
way it doesn't look unnatural then what
I will do is take a little bit of just
face powder this is mineralized
skinfinish and medium plus and just dab
it on the inner corner of my brows and
you'll see how that will lighten them up
and not make them look as harsh then I
will go in with mac cosmetics Indian Inc
eyeshadow this is a pro color I believe
you can get online though or any pro
store this is such a gorgeous matte very
pigmented cool tone purple I love it so
using an e 15 from Sigma I'm going to
just put this on the entire lower lash
line I start on the inner corner I'm
sorry outer corner because I always want
the outer corners of my eyes to be the
darkest because I think it's the most
flattering if you have to choose to have
the darkness somewhere I choose the
outer corner then I will go in with
parfait and more this again is from Mac
and it is a lighter cool tone purple so
taking any pencil
brush I'm gonna buff that out all the
way from inner corner to outer corner
back and forth make sure that you buff
this out really really well because you
do not want harsh lines underneath the
eyes because that's when it can look
harsh but if everything is buffed out it
will not look too intense or raccoon
eyes then I'm going to go in with a
makeup geek foiled eyeshadow this is in
the shade Caitlin Rose so so beautiful
and I just wanted to add this for an
extra pop these foiled eyeshadows are
incredible so just taking that same
brush I'm going to dab Caitlin Rose all
over that lower lash line as well just
for a little bit more drama then I'm
going to highlight my brow bone using
Mac shroom which is one of my all-time
favorite brow highlights ever it is a
cool tone highlight which is amazing it
works well on so many different skin
tones I used to always use this as a
cheekbone highlight on tons of my
clients because it's just so gorgeous so
this is shroom by Mac then I'm going to
just coat my lower lash lashes with
mascara I couldn't really show you this
because I get my forehead all up in the
camera but that's okay
you get the point then I'm going to
contour using Makeup Forever bronzer and
number 20 there is a 10 a 20 and a 40 I
believe there's probably a 30 to em but
I am using number 20 which is a little
bit light but I like it because I can be
really heavy-handed and it doesn't look
too dramatic so that is why I stick with
20 and then I am using a rounded blush
brush by makeup geek to contour it is
the perfect most like tiny stiffest
brush ever for contouring it's
incredible and then I will go in and
blend everything out with the morphe
brushes mb5 brush and I'm going to make
sure that that contour is nice and stiff
back by those ears because that's where
I like it to be sharp I'm going to be
mixing Mac pink swoon and makeup geek
rendezvous blush rendezvous has a little
bit more of a purple lilac tone in it
and I just felt like mixing it this is
totally unnecessary like really you can
use whatever you please but I just
wanted to use a very cool tone pinky
kind of purpley blush because this will
really complement the cool tones and the
grays and the purples and our eyes so
I'm just blending that into the contour
working up towards the temples and then
I'm going to go in with hourglass
ambient lighting powder and the shade
luminous light
I have reef all in love with this
recently and I have
use it non-stop for the past couple of
weeks using a tapered highlighting brush
from Sigma I'm going to put that on the
top of my cheekbones and then kind of
just right on the center of that cheek
as well to give that blush a little bit
of a glow then to finish this off I
decided to go in with an eyeliner on my
waterline this is ardency in liner in
the shade dark blue but it just comes
off as more like a royally purple blue
it matched my lower lash line perfectly
so you can see how that looks you could
leave this blank
you could put black black would be very
striking and very beautiful with this
look but I just wanted to do an entire
purple lower lash line so that is what I
chose I think that it looks so awesome
then I'm going to go in with mac
cosmetics blankety lipstick I wanted to
do something super nude you can do
whatever you please
I feel like lips are always a very
personal choice as to how you choose to
match it with your look but I wanted to
do a really nude lip color and blankety
is kind of a grey cool tone nude then I
couldn't decide what facial spray I
wanted to use today I was very
indecisive so we're going to just double
fist it and go in with Urban Decay all
nighter and Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray so that completes our look
and then after I got done curling my
hair I was like wait my lip is way too
nude so I decided to go in with bite
Beauty lush fruit lip gloss in the shade
peach just a pinking up a little bit and
help complement our face so that
completes our look you guys Happy New
Year's I love you so much I'll see you
in 2015 have an amazing night and I'll
talk to you later
