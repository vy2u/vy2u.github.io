Year's Eve makeup tutorial I chose this
look specifically because it's going to
complement all eye colors and all skin
tones to me this just looks like such a
traditional glamorous New Year's Eve
smokey eye with the silver black and
then of course I incorporated some
glitter why wouldn't I it looks complex
but it is so easy and simple to achieve
this look so I don't know if I am going
to be able to get around to film any
other New Year's Eve look before New
Year's Eve creeps up on us in a couple
of days since I have been sick and I am
in the process of moving a lot has been
going on so I am a little behind on what
I was planning to do so with that being
said I will probably see you guys next
year and I hope that you enjoy the end
of 2013 with your friends and your
family and your loved ones I love you
guys so much and I can't wait to share
2014 with you so thank you so much for
all your love and support I hope you
enjoyed this tutorial and I'll see you
soon bye why hello there
umm let's get started I am moisturizing
my lips using baby lips dr. rescue and
then I am going to prime my eyes as
always I am using that Pro Longwear
concealer you can use any sort of primer
just make sure you prime them then going
in with makeup geek eyeshadow I'm going
to use the shade beaches and cream this
is pretty much the exact same shade as
my skin tone but just about a shade
darker you don't want anything that is
going to be actually Brown you want it
to be very neutral and very very close
to your skin tone this is very important
when working with shades so dark like
silver and black and Gray's it's going
to really help blend everything out so
as you don't have that harsh choppy line
that so easily comes with using black
matte shadows then using Mac platinum
pigment good okay it's hard to do that
because I'm still a little sick but it's
gorge so using a sigma e55 brush as
always I'm going to pack this all over
my lid as you can see I'm going to pack
it much more densely and pigmented in
the inner
corner once we get to the outer corner
I'm not going to focus as much I take it
right out of the cap because it's so
pigmented you will never run out of a
mac pigment or any pigment in your life
it's ridiculous what a little amount you
need so once I get to that outer corner
I'm just kind of fading it away you want
the most pigment to definitely be in the
inner corner then I'm going in with
makeup geek corrupt shadow this is the
blackest shadow I've ever used in my
entire life and I am using a sigma
pencil brush I will have all the brushes
listed below in the order that I use
them with links for you guys as always
anyways
I with a pencil brush I'm just putting
that in that outer corner and a v-shape
as you can see you get crazy fallout and
it's going to be super messy but that's
okay because we're going to go in with
my Mac typographic this is the Savior
when it comes to a black smoky eye I'm
using an e25 brush by Sigma which is the
perfect brush for this with a very small
amount of that type of graphic on it and
I'm going to just blend blend blend you
want to go back and forth right in
between that crease and that neutral
shade that we applied in the first place
and this is what's going to give you
that blown out smoky eye that seems very
hard to achieve when working with black
colors but that gray is really our
saving grace I will go back in with the
pencil brush and darken it up a little
bit and then just keep blending just
keep blending because blending is the
most important key in the world when
doing this look then using any black
liner
I believe I'm using Maybelline's eye
studio and blackest black of course
blackest black and filling it in I
sucked so bad at filming my eyeliner
today I'm so sorry
so boom it's applied but I am taking
makeup remover or an eye cream or
moisturizer with a q-tip and I'm
defining everything by cleaning up the
edges because you're going to get
fallout with that black and then I go
along that line just to make it that
perfect cat eye then I'm going to apply
false lashes I'm using the lower lashes
and strike a pose as always and then I
do have a video on applying false lashes
very in-depth and I will put that down
in the bottom bar for you guys along
with like my eyebrow tutorial other
stuff like that then I'm using a NARS
sheer glow in the color Punjab and I am
using a sigma f80 flat top kabuki duh to
apply this all over my face so I'm just
working this in you do not need
huge amount of this because I'm going to
go in and highlight afterwards so sheer
amount of the sheer glow is perfectly
fine then I'm going to go in with I
don't even remember stroke up stroke of
light
yeah stroke of light from bare minerals
and this is in the shade luminous too
and I'm going to apply this all in the
areas where I want to highlight a little
bit this is going to look really pretty
with these smokey eyes on New Year's Eve
it really finishes off the look to
highlight so on the Cupid's bow the chin
the jawline and then in between eyebrows
up on the forehead I'm just going to
apply that highlighter then my concealer
I am applying Mac Pro Longwear concealer
in shade NW 20 which is a baby pink tone
and I'm going to dab that underneath my
eyes and then blend it out with another
Sigma kabuki brush I think this is the F
84 and I'm probably totally wrong but L
is the name of the brush below it's my
favorite concealer brush then with the
tapered highlighter brush I'm just going
to set my under eye concealer with a
powder make sure it is a very fine
building powder so that it's not thick
or chalky and doesn't cake up and
actually make those under eye lines look
even more intense then after we have set
that with the highlighter I am going to
use Mac shroom this is my Holy Grail
under brow highlight of all-time
I'm using a sigma concealer brush I
don't know why it's been my favorite
brush for highlighting recently and I'm
going to put a generous amount of this
you can even take like a dab of an even
lighter color for something really
intense because it's New Year's Eve so
you can go overboard and then I'm going
to use makeup forever bronzer and number
20 and by NARS EDA brush and I'm going
to just sculpt out those cheeks I do
have a contour video which I will put
below if you want to see in depth
exactly how I contour and how I
recommend contouring hello husband
thank you and then I'm going to just go
ahead and carve out the forehead as well
and then once I have done that harshly
with this brush I'm going to go in with
a flatter fluffier brush and blend that
out so that we don't have anything harsh
because you know me I do not want any
harsh lines whatsoever I love this brush
so much it's actually by Marc Jacobs it
was an impulse buy and I couldn't be
more proud because it was a great
decision then I go with that same
concealer brush and run it on my jaw
line just to sculpt out that contour
that way that blending didn't make it
look like it's bronze inks I definitely
want it to be a contour then I'm going
and with Mack floor power this is a
beautiful blush it's the perfect amount
of pink and rose to it and I'm just
going to put blush all over the apples
of my cheeks blending backward using a
Mac 129 short handle brush and then I'm
going to top it off with a little bit of
margin this is also by Mac and I'm going
to just put that right over top for a
little bit of a glow and just keep
blending that out going in circular
motions then I'm using mary lou manizer
by the balm which is a beautiful
highlight then a sigma tapered brush and
boom I applied too much highlighter and
I was like oh I forgot how pigmented
this was so I will just go back with my
blush brush and blend that out this
cheek was a little bit better I didn't
go overboard but I'm just going to grab
my brush anyways and go over at all
because it was looking a little intense
even for New Year's Eve then I'm just
going to coat my brows with a Nastasia
brow gel so that my hairs on my eyes are
not flapping in the wind and then I'm
going to take corrupt again by makeup
geek run this along my lower lash line
pressing this as tightly as possible
into that lash line by that waterline
and then we're going to go in and smudge
out with a pencil brush you don't have
to be super clean with this you can go
in with the gray color again to blend
this out you can grab peaches-and-cream
again to blend this out whatever you're
comfortable with then I'm going to go in
with ice queen this is by makeup geek
I'm going to run this along my inner
corner for a really bright inner corner
highlight because hello it finishes off
that look it looks balanced then I'm
going to use Urban Decay heavy metal
glitter liner and glam rock absolutely
love love love these four vindicate
glitter liners if you are a glitter
junkie like me then you would love this
line of glitter it doesn't burn your
eyes it doesn't sting it doesn't get
crunchy it doesn't peel off they're
great great glitter liners so I'm going
to run that along my bottom lash line
halfway through and then kind of blend
it out so that it doesn't get too chunky
and then I'm going to go over my lashes
with Rimmel lash pass/no lash
accelerator mascara boom then I am using
Lime Crime lipstick in Coquette and then
once I have on the Coquette I'm going to
go over it within the gloss by dose of
color I mentioned in my vlogmas how much
I'm excited to try these and this is in
the shade petals
so that is going to complete our nude
lip I have to apologize you guys I have
just been getting over getting sick so I
know my voice was super raspy in this

voice over but it is me Jacqueline I
