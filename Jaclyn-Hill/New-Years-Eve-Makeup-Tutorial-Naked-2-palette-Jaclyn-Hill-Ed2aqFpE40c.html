a video in what feels like years I think
it's been almost a month now and I am
very sorry for that but at the same time
I knew that December would be like this
because it has just been crazy and
working in retail over the holidays is
just I need a nap so anyways I know that
this is extremely extremely last-minute
but this doesn't just have to be a New
Year's Eve look you can use this for a
party like a clubbing look going out
with your friends a date and there's
things you can do to manipulate this
look you don't have to use the glitter
that I use in the end you can do it
without that you don't have to add the
black you could put you know some coal
in your waterline to make it even smoky
or you can really manipulate this look
and have fun with it so I'm doing a New
Year's Eve look using the Naked 2
palettes because I've gotten requests
for both of those things and I figured
I'd bang out on one video so yes I hope
you enjoy and I will hopefully see you
very soon okay
first thing I'm doing is taking the
shade tees from the naked 2 palette and
a big fluffy synthetic hair brush as
always use this brush because it really
buffs out the color I want this brush to
be big and fat this is a limited edition
holiday brush from Mac and even though
it's like a cheapest brushes that Mac
makes because they're machine made when
they come out in the holiday I'm like
obsessed with this and whenever the
holiday cuts come out I pick up a new
224 because I just love them so much in
the holiday kits I cheated a little bit
and I'm grabbing some soft brown because
I just needed a little bit more warmth
in my crease you can also use the color
buck from The Naked 1 palette if you
have it that one is gonna have some
warmth in it too but I just don't want
that color that blending color to be too
cool tone because the rest of this look
is very cool toner so that I'm taking
Verve again from The Naked 2 palette and
this is such a gorgeous like silvery but
not like chunky silver all-over lid
color you see it as I'm applying it so
I'm taking this all the way from inner
corner to outer corner and I don't want
this color to go above my crease I'm
carving it in my inner corner in my
crease going out to the outer corner but
as you can see I'm not bringing it up
higher above my crease I want this to
stay low ok so then after that I'm going
to take the exact same brush with the
color ydk I love this color it's like a
purplish with some warmth in it but
still coolness in it I don't know but
I'm going to take this halfway in my lid
and push out to my outer corner now this
look is really different for me because
I normally try to just do like one
shimmery shade and then the rest mattes
but this one I'm using a lot of shimmer
which is why it's directed towards New
Year's Eve because we all want to
glisten and glow in the twinkling lights
so I'm going to take busted it's like a
purpley moi V color it's not like purple
purple but it's got a purple tone in it
which I really like because I don't like
straight-up Purple's on myself not right
now I'm just not on that phase but I
really like this shade and so I'm going
to put this in my crease I'm not gonna
bring it up too high in that outer
corner like I do with matte colors I'm
going to keep this pretty low because it
is a shimmer like I said I don't use a
lot of shimmer on the outer eyes because
it
kind of tend to drag the eyelid down if
it's done wrong so we're going to try to
do it properly here and keep it low in
the crease I'm using a Mac 217 and this
will really help to just carve it out
and give it a nice shape where it's more
dense and not high up and I'm taking
that same brush with no more additional
product on it and just going in between
those two colors just to like even them
out so that there is no like choppiness
from those shimmery shadows and then
that brush that I'm using has just a
tiny bit more of either soft brown or
the first color I use T's what's it
called I think so yeah either one and
then I'm going back with the first color
that I use and I'm just reapply it on
the inner corners and I'm sorry if I'm
moving kind of quickly in this video but
I did my makeup super fast because I was
definitely losing daylight um I'm taking
black out now so the blackest color that
you can find now this one needs to be
matte this one has a shimmer or glitter
in it it's going to have like the
opposite effect and just rub the shades
together and come off it's not going to
stay on very well so I'm rubbing that in
my outer corner I start at the lash line
and then I work up and kind of a rounded
V motion so lash line kind of out and up
as you can see when I first put it on
there I put it on there pretty precise
and then I blend it out so you want to
work from the bottom lot like the lash
line at the top to the outer corner and
then kind of carve it back up into the
crease so you have like a little u-turn
shape on the outer corner of your eye
this will help enhance the eyes make
them look bigger brighter more of that
almond cat eye shape which is what
everybody desires
apparently so I'm doing the exact same
thing the other eye and I'm just
darkening it after I've blended it out I
just want to go in and put just a little
bit more just to give it more depth and
you want it to be the darkest by the
lashline and the lightest up in the
crease that's why I'm going over it in
my crease but not down at the lash line
so then take any highlight shade that
you prefer I am using Mac shroom because
there's not a good highlight shade in
the Naked 2 palette there is one but
it's way too pink and for this I don't
want a pink highlight I want something
that's just like a straight neutral
shimmery
gleaming highlight I don't want pinkness
on this I that would not be flattering
so then I'm going to take max pressed
pigment I'm absolutely obsessed with
this right now it's called angelic they
just came out with a new line of all
these pressed pigments just on the 26 of
December and this is one of them and I
am taking all my finger and just patting
it on my lid and this will put the
perfect amount of product on your lid
without getting fallout all over your
cheeks and I kind of tug and pull my eye
taunt to really get on there precisely
and then I'm going to spray it with just
normal water or I'm using rose water
from Mario Badescu or fix+ whatever you
have and then I'm going to dab that
mainly on the inner corner because that
will give it like a really really shiny
sleek look and I don't I'm not putting
that all over the lid just mainly on the
inner corner to really make it pop
especially when you're looking around
the room and turning your head so I did
my liner and I didn't film it
accidentally but that's okay
I'm putting on false lashes red cherry
number 43 and then boom hello I have
foundation and concealer on I recorded
my foundation and concealer the entire
thing and well no let me restate that I
thought I was recording and I wasn't the
entire time so I'm a little disappointed
in myself but it's okay because I have a
foundation routine and a concealer
routine so you can look at that on the
link below I am using this new Chanel I
know so fancy right like Chanel really
okay it's I don't know how to pronounce
it honestly but it's there cream bronzer
look at how beautiful this blends on
like it is a joke how gorgeous this is
it's a cream but it dries like a like
kind of a dewy powdery finish it is the
most gorgeous color it looks amazing on
everybody it's not too dark it's not too
orange it's not too red and it is
definitely worth the $48 that I spent on
it and it's huge so it'll last forever
so I'm just using this as a slight
contour not a dramatic one all around my
face as you saw I'm touching up my false
lashes with just a little bit mascara on
just the natural lashes and then when
this entire look is done I'm going to go
over my eyeliner again just to blacken
it from any fallout and the lash glue
I'm taking Mac's soft and gentle and I'm
going to rub this all on my cheek
bones up and down where the blush would
go up high is a highlight I'm doing this
first so that when I put on my blush it
looks more natural kind of like the glow
is coming from within and not just
sitting on top I'm taking max crystal
avalanche again because I don't think
the Naked 2 palette has a really good
highlight and I want to be really really
bright on the inner eye for that great
New Year's Eve look I'm taking this Mac
Pro sculpting powder I don't know the
name I'll have it down below and max
care blend powder in the shade light and
I'm mixing them together because the pro
powder has some shimmer in it and it's
too light for my skin tone but if you're
really fair it would be gorgeous but I'm
going to mix them together and just
lightly set my concealer to really give
a very highlighted under eye area
because on New Year's Eve there's no
better excuse than to highlight and
contour yourself out like as much as you
want I'm taking that same crystal
avalanche color and I'm highlighting
down the center of my nose blending out
so it's not too intense Cupid's bow to
draw more attention to the mouth and
then I'm going to take Mac's rosy
outlook blush this is a pro longwear
blush it has a matte finish and it's
guaranteed to last for eight hours and
it does if you're oily this is going to
become your new best friends so get
introduced to become friends love it but
okay I'm going to take the exact same
color that I did on my top lid and I'm
going to put it all over the bottom once
again I don't do shimmer underneath my
eye very often because I think it can
tend to drag the eye down but it's New
Year's Eve so you do it over the hell
you want because it's going to be a good
night so just throw glitter all over
your body if you need to I'm going to
just buff in the outer corner I'm taking
a little bit of that purple that busting
shade putting that in the outer core
outer corner and just rubbing it out and
being very rude and covering up the
camera with my mirror you can see out my
window hi nature and I'm just mascara in
my bottom lashes you can also put some
eye Kohl in your inner rim on your
waterline to darken up this eye and make
it more smoky which I do at the very end
and I'll have pictures of it um right
now I'm using Japanese maple lipstick by
Mac and then I'm going to go over it
with Nicki Minaj's lip gloss her pink
shade she's also having a new purple one
coming out soon but this is the pink
because I don't want my lips to be new
to nude or too bright so I think this is
like
the perfect combination so after that
you are all done let me know what you
think let me know what you're doing for
New Year's because I'm doing nothing so
have fun for me and I'll see you guys
soon
love you bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
