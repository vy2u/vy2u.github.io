makeup look is going to be my New Year's
Eve slash party makeup tutorial I have
to put / party makeup tutorial because
this look is in no way restricted or
just limited to New Year's Eve you can
wear this whenever you have a party to
go to something super glam Tuesday
afternoon lunch with your boss totally
appropriate so I for writing New Year's
on our forehead which would totally
complete the look and glitter right
right I just you like New Year's Eve is
that one night of the year where you can
pretty much dunk your face and like a
bucket of glitter and show up to the
party and people are going to be like so
today I am using Purple's blues and
Silver's to create this cut crease inner
corner cat eye situation that we have
going on here it feels so weird for me

transition color my crease like it
didn't happen when you guys this video

jump into the video now I hope that you

2015 I was actually thinking about
making an entire dedicated video for New
Year's Eve just to say thank you so much

the support and love that you've shown
me throughout the year but I was like
you know what Jacqueline they know that
might be a little cheesy but I love you

of course you're gonna have things that
make you just want to scream and cry but
we can get through it right so thank you
so much for watching this thank you so
much for supporting me I love you guys
and Happy New Year's hey hey everybody
so my eyes are already primed and I'm
going to start off with this makeup geek
eyeshadow in the shade you this is kind
of a cool tone lilac medium tone purple
and I'm going
grab a precision brush this is the
morphe m51 8 and as you can see it's
kind of long and skinny and narrow and I
am going to ever so lightly begin to
dust this in the upper crease area I'm
going to avoid the lid since we are
doing a cut crease today and I am using
extremely extremely light handed motions
and then once that purple begins to
leave my brush I'll press a little bit
harder to kind of blend it out now I'm
going to go in with time travel this is
another matte makeupgeek shade this
slightly reminds me of Mac plumage so if
you have that one it would pretty much
be a dupe for this one and using a Mac
242 I'm going to just begin to carve out
my crease area you can do this with any
brush that you're comfortable with this
is the one that I personally am
comfortable with and you can also create
your crease wherever you want you can
put it higher you can put it lower if
you don't have a crease if you have
hooded eyes you can really create this
cut crease wherever you want on the eye
space then I'll go back with that same
morphe m51 8 and a little bit more of
that purple shade to just blend out the
edges but making sure that we really
aren't blending anything on the actual
lid we're working strictly on the upper
crease area since we are doing that cut
crease eye and I wanted to show you the
exact same thing on the other eye how I
start in the outer corner and I bring it
all the way into the inner corner if
you're getting a little sloppy don't
worry even if I as I was doing this I
was like I'm getting a little sloppy and
I have to start over but I didn't I
powered through and it all came together
so it's ok if it falls down on the lid a
little bit or looks unblended you can
totally fix that later just try to
really make sure that you are precisely
cutting the crease and that's really all
you need to worry about at this moment
now I'm going to go in with a Natasha de
Nonna eyeshadow these palettes are
insanely expensive but you can buy these
shadows individually which I got super
excited about this is the shadow 45m
industrial I'm going to use a 242 brush
again it's basically what I'm using for
everything in this look and I'm going to
spritz my brush with some mac fix+ to
make this just a little bit more
metallic and go on SuperDuper pigmented
so at this point what I'm going to do is
put it all over my lid like normal and
then when I get to the crease area where
we have that shadow I'm going to make
sure to only go and windshield wiper
motions as you can see I'll kind of
swipe and Pat on the lid but then when I
get to the crease I lay my brush down
flat and I just go in windshield wiper
motions and I don't pick up my brush to
really make sure that we're carving out
that crease and keeping it nice and
cut because we don't want to blend that
blue and purple with the silver we
really want them to be different you
know what I'm saying nice and cut so
once we have that done and we have that
silver all over the lid I am then going
to go back in and blend out the inner
corner because I feel like it was just a
little choppy so I'm using the morphe
m50 7 I use this in a couple videos ago
as well it's such a tiny little
precision brush that's great for things
like this like precise inner corner
blending so I put a little bit more of
that curve for you that matte purple and
then just blend away on the inner corner
and I realize I want it to be just a
little bit more pigmented and I wanted a
little bit more of that unique blue to
pop in my outer crease so I picked up a
little bit more and again with the same
Mac 242 brush I'm going to just add a
little bit more of that time travel
shade because I just it's New Years Eve
I want these colors to pop I don't want
it just to look like it's silver and
black I want I want you to be able to
see that it's clearly like fun colors my
crease and then going back with that
same precision brush I'm going to just
blend out a little bit and move on it's
a lot of blending right you kind of got
to keep looking backing up looking
backing up to make sure that you're
getting what you want so now I am going
to be going in with some gel liner I
feel like I haven't done a winged liner
and so long can you hear like the gates
of heaven opening yes thank you God
eyeliner eyeliner for the wind I need
this in my life so I'm going to be going
in and just doing a regular wing I'm
going to keep this a little bit more on
the thin side because I like my eyeliner
personally very thick it's like all or
nothing for me but this is more of a
thin liner for me today so I didn't want
to cover up or overpower what we have
going on the rest of the eye so I want
to keep it more on the thin side and as
you see I literally make a straight line
on the outer corner of my eye and then I
carve it out and I'm going to just draw
a line straight across across my lid on
my lash line and then I fill it in using
that Maybelline gel liner in the shade
blackest black and as far as the eye
brush that I'm using the liner brush is
a Sigma F 65 brush now for lashes I'm
going to use the lower lash in the city
because these have like a really nice
fluffy wing on the outer edge but
they're fairly short on the inner corner
in the middle of the eye so they're not
going to cover up this look I didn't
want to go in with something too fluffy
that was going to cover it up now we're
going to be trying the Nivea men
aftershave
all that nikkietutorials is always
raving about and it does smell a little
bit like a dude but a good dude it's not
gross it's not disgusting and I'm going
to massage that into my skin until it
gets nice and sticky and tacky this is
definitely a fad right now tons of
youtubers are trying it and I have to
say I've only used it once but I did
like it and my skin was not irritated by
it hallelujah so now I'm going to be
doing my foundation and I am using the
ex1 a liquid foundation the invisi wear
and I am in shade 300 for those of you
who are asking to apply it I'm using the
e 54 by morphe this is one of their new
elite brushes it's like super huge I
didn't think I was going to like it but
I've been using it for the past week I
really do enjoy this brush now for
concealer I'm going to be using the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD concealer that I
raved about my December favorites I love
it so much but as you can see it's like
the exact same color as my foundation
and for New Year's Eve and for this eye
look I really wanted a highlighted look
so I'm going to go in with a little bit
of the Urban Decay Naked concealer in
the shade light and just add a little
bit more and then blend it out with a
damp Beauty Blender make sure your
Beauty Blender is very very very damp
like squeeze it under the sink like 1520
times get it really damp and then just
like lightly squeeze out on a paper
towel when it's SuperDuper damp I think
that it looks makes your concealer and
foundation look the most natural by
adding that moisture and it picks up
excess product I'm going to take a
little bit more of that and put it on
the chin the nose and the forehead and
then kind of take a step back and look
at the rest of my face and see where I
want to add any lights so I'm going to
put a little bit on the cheek area right
above my smile lines but not on them
otherwise they'll get Creasy and then
right on my Cupid's bow as well and then
go back in with that damp Beauty Blender
and blend out you'll see in the end of
this look why I did this right now it's
kind of like wait what's the point but
when everything is done you'll see that
those areas stay nice and light compared
to the rest of the face and it just
gives the face so much dimension and I
absolutely I love it so now I'm going to
be mixing a Nastasia banana powder and
Mac Pro emphasize to set my under eye
concealer and this will also give a
little bit more highlight at the same
time and I'm using the morphe 48 to do
this and I am in love with this brush I
like this so much more than the one that
I've been using for oh I don't know the
past four years now to set my entire
face I'm using the Mac mineralized
skinfinish in the shade medium and just
a fluffy brush and I'm going to go over
my entire face very lightly I raved
about this product in my
favorites video I just love that it's
such light coverage so lightweight and
it has a little bit of luminosity in it
so it keeps your skin looking very
natural and fresh all day long which is
hello that's the drink like that's where
all we're asking for it right at least I
am now we're going to be bronzing and I
am using the Make Up For Ever bronzer
and the shade two five one I believe and
I am using this gigantic tomforde
bronzer brush that is totally
unnecessary but absolutely amazing all
at the same time and I'm going to just
be bronzing my cheeks and my forehead
and then what I'm going to do is that
after I get like a layer of bronzer down
I'm actually going to contour so now you
will see me go in and be a little bit
more precise with this I've been doing
this a couple of times recently and I
really like the way it turns out as
opposed to just going in with a strict
contour I do a little bronzing first and
then I create that sharp line and I
really really like the way it's been
turning out I think it looks much better
in person as opposed to just contour now
I'm going to grab some Laura Mercier
translucent powder and I'm going to
begin to carve out my contour area and
I'm going to set this entire area with
that powder so that we can just bake it
for the next few minutes while we do our
brows and this is going to make
everything look much more airbrushed and
smooth while still giving us like a
sharper line so it's not messy and muddy
so now for the brows I'm going to be
using the Anastasia brow Wiz of course
and I'm using the shade caramel I go
between the shades caramel and chocolate
so those are my two favorites and I'm
going to kind of breeze through this and
editing because I don't think that
filling in brows is anything exciting to
watch so fill in your brows however you
do them and then we can move on and I'm
going to just dust off that entire
section of that power that we set you
can see how everything looks so smooth
but what I will do is just make one tiny
little strict line with that same powder
just to make it even sharper and I'm
going to let that sit there as we finish
the face now I'm going to go back in
with the Mac Pro emphasized shaping
powder I swear this is like my favorite
powder ever it's just so beautiful the
way it's not a frost but it's not a
matte and it has a sheen I can't live
without this powder I use it at least
once every single day that I do my
makeup I truly love it now I'm going to
grab a little bit of a black shadow I am
using the Kat Von D black just because
it's so creamy and it's the only one
that I have with me right now
um but any black will obviously work and
just using a flat definer brush I'm
going to just press this nice and tight
up against the lower lash line you can
totally do this with a dark purple
that'd be really beautiful too you could
even do a dark brown you could do a warm
brown anything really goes with this and
I'm going to go back in with that same
curfew purple eyeshadow and just blend
it out but we are staying away from the
inner corner we're only doing this on
the outer corner about two thirds into
the way of the eye we're leaving the
inner corner completely blank for now if
you don't want to do the inner corner
cat eye just go all the way to the inner
corner and you'll be good to go
line your rim with some black make it
nice and smoky walk out the door you're
good but I'm going to just go ahead and
do this inner corner cat eye and I'm
going to show you how I do it so I'm
using this morphe m55 9 brush it's a
really really really tiny flat headed
brush that's perfect for something like
this and using the purple first I'm just
going to go in kind of parallel to the
inner corner tear duct so you don't want
to follow it but you want to go parallel
to it then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to grab my liner brush and I'm
going to use black shadow on it so we're
starting with shadows we're doing the
light purple shadow then the black
shadow and then we're actually gonna
move on to a gel liner to make it even
blacker but it's one step at a time take
it nice and slow you don't want to
initially go in with black liner and if
you mess it up you're like crap what do
I do
so just going in with one shadow at a
time and if you mess up if you make it
go too high or too low you can take a
little bit of concealer on a definer
brush and just kind of look like erase
your mistake like really it's not that
noticeable to just correct a mistake
with a little bit of concealer on a
definer brush using the map chroma
graphic pencil in the shade NC 15 I'm
going to pop a little bit of that on my
waterline because I just wanted it to
look kind of white and pop for New
Year's Eve you could use a stark white
in there and it would look super cool
too so now I'm going to go back in with
that same gel liner this is the blackest
of black and I'm going to begin to just
go over it now you can make this line as
thick as you want or as soon as you want
actually when I took a step back I wish
in the end I made it a little bit
thicker personally but you do you
whatever you are comfortable with it is
all on you but I just like going over
this with the gel because it just makes
it a little bit more fierce and intense
and noticeable as opposed to just using
shadow so now I'm going to just coat my
lower lashes with some mascara just a
super light coat I didn't want it too
over-the-top because of what we have
going on down there I was like that
speaks for it so we don't need lashes on
top of it and then for blush I'm going
to be going in with the color pop
highly wasted blush I still don't know
how I feel about these they are a little
difficult to work with I added a little
bit of a baby pink blush from my
collection to it because I just feel
like I was getting no payoff um I need
to keep playing with these because I
just I don't know my opinion is still up
in the air about these right now just
for the time being we'll figure it out
so now for highlight I'm going to grab
backup pearl I thought this was the
perfect shade for this look because I
didn't want anything too bronzy or two
golden definitely something cool and
silver so using a morphe m5o one I'm
going to pop this on the apples of the
cheeks to really make a statement and
it'll give you those nice round babydoll
cheeks and then I will run it up along
the cheekbone I kind of kept it on the
lower part of my cheekbone today but we
are going to grab the blush brush and go
back over otherwise it looks like a
tiger stripe which hey it's New Year's
do you but I don't want to do a tiger
stripe you could add some silver sparkle
to your cheeks and that would look
gorgeous as well just saying that's a
beautiful like addition for a New Year's
Eve look so I'm just wiping away that
excess powder right underneath the
contour and then for lips I'm going to
be using the Anastasia liquid lipstick
in the shade of Lee now this is a really
nice babydoll pink but a few minutes
later I was like I don't want it to be
this pink so I added a little bit of Mac
blankety over my lips which is just kind
of like a purpley nude but if you're
into like this pink lip with this look
you do you whatever lip you want to do
will work so that completes this New
Year's Eve look you guys I hope you
enjoy thank you for watching I love you
I'll see you soon
this but you BA know what she or he or
faced with name be teen just so weird
that not weird
well thank you because I would've been
past you would have met that my groove
