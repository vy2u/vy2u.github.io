a New York City beauty haul it sounds so
much more fabulous than it really is
because this is not an IMATS haul this
is actually just in every day we run in
the middle Sephora haul except it was
Sephora on Fifth Avenue which is much
more exciting it was literally like haha
we turned the corner I was like we're
here I'm home I did not get to do any
I'm at shopping whatsoever because I was
literally escorted from the car to the
Sigma booth I was at the Sigma booth
about 45 to 50 minutes past my time
frame and then escorted it back to the
car then on Sunday I was not at IMATS
because I got sick with the 24-hour flu
I caught it from my husband John John
had it on Saturday which is why he was
not there I'm max on Saturday with us
and then I was sick in bed on Sunday so
suckage but other than that I got a bed
on Monday did some shopping hung out in
the city a little bit I forced myself
like I'm not gonna lay in bed and cry
during my New York trip let's get real
people
sidenote Georgie is going to probably be
grunting this entire video down at my
feet I'm home alone right now so John
cannot keep him like he normally does in
my film and he's kind of a mama's boy so
he has to be at my feet the entire time
right now he is chewing on a pair of a
old like a lash box like the holds fake
lashes and it's the only thing keeping
him happy and not crying and barking
because he wants to be on my lap so
pardon the Georgie grunts let's get
started when I was shopping I didn't
think I really was buying that much but
it ended up that it was it was a lot so
I'm gonna try to blaze on through this I
just want to show you guys this first
really quick because this is awesome
it's a 500-point gift if you have a
Beauty Insider card which if you shop it
so for whatsoever you should it just
earned you points and you can get free
stuff and a say Peter Thomas Peter
Thomas Roth kit Peter Thomas Roth is
known for his skin care he's got an
amazing line and it's just a really
great kit it has a mask in there has an
exfoliant it has a cleanser and it has a
moisturizer
I love his product so this is a really
really great gift I usually really don't
care much for the gifts but this is
awesome and it's still there so if you
have
saved up go get this gift while it's out
it's awesome I got the dr. Denis growth
daily essentials hyaluronic moisture
cushion so fancy it's pretty much just a
moisturizer and it has hyaluronic acid
in it which is great for all skin types
whether you are oily normal combination
dry sensitive whatever is highly wrong a
hyaluronic acid is really great for all
skin types this one is going to really
help to hydrate it has a lot of
humectants in it humectant is a word for
a product that is going to draw humidity
to the skin so someone who is on the dry
side you want humectants so this is a
new product it just came out within the
last couple of weeks and i'm supersized
excited to I can't speak today you guys
I never can in halls or favorites I get
tongue-tied
anyways I'm excited to try this product
I got the Josie Maran model citizen
whipped argan oil body butter the
packaging like dye this is limited
edition with African red Robo scent
rooibos I have no idea you got me Josie
I saw this as I was walking out of the
store and I was like what is this and
ran back up to the register and bought
it naturally it's josie maran it smells
so fresh God so light it's like warm and
cool and scents just absolutely amazing
her original body butter I'm not the
biggest fan of I had it I ended up
giving it away got rid of it because it
just I loved the way it felt on my skin
I just couldn't deal with the scent but
this vent is magnificent so I'm so so
happy she came out this I probably will
end up go going and buying a few more
because this might become a favorite Oh
Jorgie that hurt I'm just going to keep
going down the skincare route because
it's all I hear on top I got the origins
clear improvement active charcoal masks
to clean pores clear pores to clear
pores this is typically something that
someone with oily skin would use but
because I have a dry skin person who
struggles with some unknown texture on
my cheek areas areas really cheek area
I like masks like this
things that have like acids in them I
like peels things like charcoal masks
that really go deep down and pull stuff
out even though they can tend to
sometimes dry me out a little more
temporarily it really does clean out the
pores so I'm really excited to try this
I'll let you know how I feel okay my
last skincare product is the red
glycolic lactic radiance renewal mask
whoo it's a mouthful this is an
exfoliating mask formulated to renew the
complexion dramatically improves skin
tone radiance and reduce the appearance
of fine lines and wrinkles boom heavenly
oh and then I just picked up this little
baby bottle of the fresh sea berry
restoration body cream I am obsessed
with the fresh sea very oil the face oil
so I just thought why not give a little
baby
shout out it's a little Seabury body
cream it's so cute I gotta have it let's
just be honest the little bins up by the
front the register they get me every
time I've got the newest levelly this is
the newest it's the product handy the
floral scent and I have the original
product handy and I was absolutely
obsessed with it when it first came out
about two years ago two and half years
ago two hundred to two years ago because
it came out around Easter Wow off topic
moving on and I just overused it when it
came out and I'm not really into scents
like that anymore it's very warm it has
a lot of vanilla and musk and that's not
really my style for perfume anymore so
when I smelled this I was like shocked
it's just not really similar to the
original whatsoever has such a fresh
scent a little dab'll of warmth but it's
nothing like the original scent where
it's just like candy it's very hard to
explain cents but the party kept
prodding Candy Girl lost her mind the
Prada candy floral is amazeballs smell
it oh I lied I have another skincare
item this is the fresh peony brightening
night treatment mask visibly diminishes
dark spots and even skin tone Wow I feel
like barely even read that with these
lights in my face over I just saw this
right in front it just came out a few
days ago I believe and it is just
supposed to help light and appearance of
dark spots correct uneven skin tone
significant
significantly brighten the complexion
and it's a highly concentrated overnight
treatment that is also proven to
replenish and preserve hydration for 24
hours so I love sleep masks I have a few
of them my absolute favorite favorite of
life is by course so nice but I figured
I would give this a try my sister who's
an aesthetician loves the brand fresh
I've been using them for years because
of her so I usually trust their products
so I'm excited to use this whoo I got
the Tarte Amazonian clay full coverage
foundation I don't know why I've never
tried this before I really have never
even seen anybody try this before no
one's ever even told me about it before
but I didn't even know that Tarte had
like a full coverage 12-hour foundation
maybe I'm crazy so I picked it up in the
shade light medium sand because they
were out of a few shades and this looks
like it was the closest even though I
really felt like I was just a light
medium but they were out so I like like
medium sand here we go I got two of the
new Too Faced melted liquefied along
wear lipstick these these have been all
over Instagram recently everybody is
receiving them so I had to pick two up
as always whenever I try a new lip
product I always always get the nudes
that's just me it's so silly but I truly
feel like I can never have enough nudes
in my collection I just they're all so
different to me as silly as that sounds
so I got the shade melted nude and
melted peony let me give you guys a
little swatches swatch so this is what
the packaging looks like right here and
then this obviously screws off and you
like a little sponge tip applicator so
it's different it's not like anything
else that I own as far as the
application and they go on really smooth
and they almost feel like they're going
to be a stain and dry matte but yet they
don't dry matte they have a gloss and a
shine in them I know I'm probably
confusing you guys so much right now but
that's another part really that's
because this product is a little
confusing to me I haven't actually tried
them on the lips yet because I haven't
used any of the stuff in this bag I
force myself to wait until I've shown
you guys and then this right here is
melted peony which is just a really
beautiful baby pink shade then I got two
of the Josie Maran Argan infinity lip
and cheek creamy oil these just came out
as well they were sitting right there
when you first walk into the door and I
just love the packaging for these it
looks like her infinity cream it's made
for the face and body but they're like
little mini tubes so cute so of course
since it's Josie Maran I have to just
buy everything because that's I just
love her products so much I have forever
so let me just show you what these look
like this is limitless pink right here
and it blends out in a really creamy way
you can see how velocity that is
compared to the two-faced ones right
there
it is just so smooth and it feels
actually like an oil oh and it smells
like all of her amazing products Georgie
and then this one is timeless coral
which I just love corals and that one is
right there they have such great pigment
and they blend out so nicely and again
they really feel like an actual oil they
don't feel dry whatsoever they're super
moisturizing I got two different Kat Von
D blushes I kind of had a Kat Von D
experience while I was there I just was
in her section for a while I don't own
my gosh no I own a couple things Kat Von
D but not many so this one right here is
XS and this is just a really pretty like
rosy Lobby pink it's I felt at the time
and I still kind of do like it's very
different from everything else that I
own it's kind of a dusty rose with a
little bit more depth in it in this
summertime especially I like wearing
blushes that have a little bit more
depth and pigment in them as opposed to
winter I like their a little bit more
like light wash and a little bit paler
on the cheeks but in this summer I like
things that are a little bit darker
because I typically have more of a tan
in the summer time so a darker blush
will really help a Tanner complexion no
just stop this is what he's begging for
right now this is John Gotti missiles
stupid ferrets it's ruining my life I
have the ferret hiding behind my
right now and he's literally trying to
claw it okay okay okay
the fair is going in the back the second
blush that I got by Kat Von D is the
shade bellissima oh this blush when I
saw it I was like where have you been my
whole life it is so gorgeous it is the
perfect peachy pink I just I I love it I
felt so in love it has the perfect
amount of shimmer in it it's just a
light wash of shimmer
nothing chunky nothing glittery and it's
not a full matte so pretty and again so
pigmented you can see just by swiping it
on the tip of my finger how pigmented it
is and I will swatch it for you on the
back of the hand it is so pretty it's
like a baby pink with peach in it it's
just absolutely gorgeous I this is a
joke okay Georgie is now officially on
my lap because this is happening maybe
he'll calm down up here he knows what's
happening the ferrets in the bag I
picked up another Beauty Blender cleaner
this is just in the solid form I love
this to clean brushes I've gone through
a few of them so I just needed one more
I got the OCC anti feather lip pencil
how do I get this out their packaging is
intense okay here we go so what this is
is it is a completely and totally clear
lip pencil and you line your lips and
then you go on with an OCC lip tar or
whatever product that you want that
might typically bleed this will save
your life with lip tars I recently have
been using a lot of OCC lip tars just it
I don't know I've just kind of
rediscovered them in my collection and
really been loving them recently but
sometimes they can tend to bleed this
will completely stop that from happening
my sister is actually the one that
recommended this to me because there's a
few products out there like this and my
sister was like go get the one from OCC
it changed my life
so thanks to see another Kat Von D
product I'm telling you like I was over
there in that section like for quite a
while this is the famous lipstick Agatha
her packaging is so unique in so her
anyways it is just a true true nude and
this is Anne
dude that very fair girls can wear if
you are very tan this is not going to be
so hot on you unless you like that
really nude vibe going on it is just a
true baby nude this is definitely a
little bit on the shear side it's not a
super opaque lipstick I would definitely
compare this to a cream Sheen formula
from Mac it pretty much has the exact
same feel on the lips so if you're
familiar with a cream Sheen lipstick
from Mac that's what this lipstick comes
off as I got easy baked eyeshadow from
Urban Decay which is so random I was
walking by and I just saw this and I was
like oh hi like as if I need more of
these shadows come out oh my god you're
Georgie easy baked is just this really
nice everyday basic champagne with a
little hint of gold in it for all over
the eye area wow that was an intense
introduction super super pigmented but
it's just absolutely gorgeous I love
shades like this they're so easy
especially in the summertime with like a
lot of looks I've been doing recently
you just throw a color like this all
over the lid a light brown to blend it
out and you're good to go it's just so
pretty and at first I was like easy
baked wait I have that and it's
different from half baked for some
reason I was like putting the - but no
easy baked I got two of the bite Beauty
lush fruit lip glosses and as always I
got them into nude shades I'm surprised
I don't know why it's just a habit
whenever I try a new lip product for the
first time I always get them in nude or
pink I never like I've never tried this
line before let's get a purple or orange
like I always do nudes because it's what
I'm comfortable with and I can really
get to know the formula and a nude
because I know my nudes and I know the
what I like and what I don't like so I
always go for nudes first so this one is
called peach which makes no sense to me
why it's called peach because it is a
true baby pink but I'll go with it
because so far so good this form
la is awesome very pigmented very creamy
and luxurious
I love bite Beauty and I'm just so happy
they've been getting so much recognition
recently that is it 80 pink right there
in the shade peach and then this one is
ram ram go tan
rambutan and this I was originally just
going to get the peach but when I saw
this color I was like oh my god stop
such a perfect nude but when I got home
I realized it's pretty much the exact
same as color your smile new lip gloss
it's pretty much the same color but this
one whatever okay I don't want to talk
about it I have a new addiction okay
last but not least I got Bobby Brown
shimmer brick in the shade apricot Bobby
Brown shimmer bricks have my heart I
love them I think I have three of them
they are just absolutely gorgeous an
apricot like could you die I just
absolutely love them this is what this
one looks like right here on this finger
they just have so much pigment they give
such a beautiful beautiful highlight on
the skin and the great thing about them
is if you want to use as a blush you can
use this side where you'll get more
orange colors if you want to use as a
highlight you can use this side where
it's a lighter shade so since they make
it in this nice on greyish effect you
can swirl all together or pick a side
for more intensity or less intensity so
Bobby Brown shimmer brick and apricot
