a no makeup makeup look if you're not
familiar with that term it pretty much
means we're going to be applying makeup
in a way where it's not gonna look like
we're really wearing makeup but we are
still wearing makeup I like to refer to
this look as a better version of
yourself because it's nothing glamorous
or over-the-top it's easy peasy but it
only takes about five to seven minutes
tops and you're just going to look like
an amplified version of you just a
little bit prettier but still very
natural you're only going to be using
these products right here so very
minimal make-up very mineral products I
have never done a look on my channel
that has been so minimal and easy peasy
this one before but if you think it's
necessary because even sometimes with
myself you can sit in front of the
mirror and you only have like five six
minutes to get ready and you're like oh
my gosh is it even worth it you know
like I don't even have the time and you
clearly can't do it
the sculptor brow the winged liner the
lashes the contour so it's like what's
the most important things to touch on
what's going to make you look better
than you already do but yet you don't
have time to do anything glamorous over
the top so that's exactly what this
video is for showing every woman things
just to touch on to tap on to make
yourself look more fresh and awake but
still like yourself and it is so quick
and easy peasy so I'm going to stop
babbling let's get into this this is
going to be a top 3 video so if you hear
Georgy and you here my husband if you
hear things it's just like people let's
get started I found to be good during
mommy's entire video and not disrupt
thank you
we just pawned some earrings so you guys
have something pretty to look at because
I do not like bare ears by the way these
earrings these like big blingy fake
diamonds they are from Kate Spade I got
them like two years ago for Christmas
but they're still always at Nordstrom a
lot of you guys ask so Kate Spade so
this video is 100% inspired by the
Perricone and Dino foundation foundation
I tweeted a picture of this and a lot of
you guys were asking for a review on it
so I thought that I would incorporate it
into this video so that you guys can see
how it applies and I can give you my
thoughts it does have an SPF of 30 in it
and it is also a sheer to medium
coverage foundation depending how you
apply it it is just perfect for
summertime with those two key things
right there not to mention the title
says it all no foundation foundation is
going to do the job of a foundation but
yet it's not going to like you're
wearing foundation which hell up who
doesn't want that so I'm going to be
using a makeup geek stippling foundation
brush to apply it and apparently hell
has officially frozen over because I'm
not using my Sigma f80 so I'm going to
pump one whoa one pump on the bathroom
button and let's get the party started
and this isn't the shade number two
light to medium it comes in two shades
and I picked the second one so I'm just
going to grab this on the back of my
hand with this makeup geek stippling
brush and then I was going to start
pressing it in to the skin I am NOT
using primer because that's just me I
don't really need primer but for those
of you who can't live without it and go
ahead and slap on your power before you
do your foundation
I also recommend when you apply your
foundation to do it as quickly as
possible after you have done your
skincare and cleanse your face and put
on your moisturizer because foundation
always tends to go on a light lot nicer
if you do that immediately after as
opposed to waiting a few hours like I
have make sure you do not neglect your
top lip when you are doing your
foundation because if you do that
sometimes you can get some like little
splotches up there if you only run
across it really quickly and then it can
kind of look you can mustache so make
sure you blend around that area I also
take my foundation and just quickly run
it over my lip area not necessarily to
conceal or put foundation on the lips
which is one
do that it'll ensure that you do not
have a missed area around the lip and
then when you go in and apply your lip
gloss you can sometimes have chalkiness
so I just go right over the lip area
just to make sure that you don't have
any lines of foundation I don't the
camera is picking up how this looks in
person but in person this foundation
looks like my skin but better it looks
very dewy very healthy but not like an
oil slick or anything like that it is
setting beautifully on the skin and the
best part is that you cannot smell the
SPF because I cannot stand the smell of
sunscreen you can't smell in this
foundation so bonus now I'm going to go
in with one more perricone MZ products
and everything in this video is
sponsored by them I promise he's Noble
who I am I went into my local Sephora
purchased these things all by myself
with my own money and one of the girls
who worked there we've kind of become
friends because she does makeup I love
makeup I love her I test her judgment
and when I walked in there she was like
you need this in your luggage I was like
okay so it is the Paragon MD no bronzer
bronzer comes in a little droplet like
this it looks like a serum and oh my
gosh get ready this is the most
beautiful bronzer of life I've worn it
for the past two days so let me show you
how I apply it is so fast and easy I'm
just going to take it and put a couple
drops on the back of my hand and this is
going to do the entire face this stuff
goes a long way when you see this you
think like okay that's so tiny that's
going to last me in a week it's not it's
a lot to a very long time because the
smallest amount is going to go forever
so I'm going to use the Sigma angled
kabuki this is the f80 for to apply this
and on the back of my hand I'm just
going to take a little bit and just kind
of rub it around mainly on the tip of
this angled brush and then I'm going to
go in and tap it all over the cheek area
just like you would with any bronzer
except instead of rubbing worse than a
tap and it is just the most natural
looking bronzer I've ever seen in my
entire life it is so beautiful so I'm
not contouring with this I am just
bronzing I'm not going to try to sit
here and sculpt out we don't have time
for that I am just going to put this all
over the cheekbone area just for a very
natural looking bronze when I first
opened this up I saw that it had some
like sparkle almost like glitter in it
and I was
oh no no she let me wrong this is not
going to work this is not cute when I
apply it I do not see any Sparkle I do
not see any glitter I don't know where
it disappears to on the skin it honestly
just looks like you have been sitting in
the Sun by the pool for the past like
five or six hours it looks so natural
there's no glitter it's just beautiful
I'm going to tap this up around the
whole forehead area just because any
time you grande the cheeks you don't
want to only do the cheeks you want to
just make sure that you even it out by
going in other areas of the face as well
if you only do the cheek area it can
just look a little uneven and lopsided
sometimes so I completely forgot to
apply my concealer I just jumped with my
bronzer I was too eager but that's okay
because in real life you're sometimes
going to get things mixed up and it's
not a big deal so I'm going to go in
with the garne skin renew anti dark
circle roller I absolutely love this
product it's so easy for days where
you're rushing and using things to be
quick you can also take it with you on
the go and it's super easy to apply so
all I'm going to do is just take this
and roll it under the eye area like that
and make sure you get it from the inner
corner and take it up because even when
you're in a hurry
you want to make sure that you always
will lift the concealer because it will
give the face lift as well so we're
going to go in with what am i using this
is a sigma soft blend concealer it's an
F 64 and I'm just going to dab and go up
towards that temple I'm going to
slightly bring it down even though we
already did that bronzer it's really not
a big deal it will honestly just help it
blend even more so if you want just
lightly hit the top of that eyelid just
to slightly cover up any veins or
discoloration you have
I was going to take that same darn a
roller and if Cabot and in these areas
just because I do have redness around my
nose which is very common in women it's
hormones there's really nothing you can
do you can't fight hormones well you can
but he'll probably lose just quickly
adding a little bit of that highlight to
the chin I'll just make everything tight
together and since I should have applied
the concealer first but I didn't edit
the bronzer first you wouldn't have to
do this but I'm just going to go back
over just make sure that I don't have
any choppiness from doing a concealer
second if you ever have choppiness when
working with liquids you can go back
with your foundation brush and just dab
over any unblended or choppy harsh areas
and that will just help blend everything
out don't swipe if you swipe it will
remove so just go and dab like if you
have any harsh line so you can just dab
it and that will just make sure
everything is blended out you don't have
those lines anymore okay I'm going look
I'm going to go in with benefit gimme
brow I have to talk about this in a
video that I did before I think it was
an everyday tutorial this is a great
product if you're just in a hurry and
you just do something to the brows and
don't have time to sit there and truly
fill it in the brush is literally so
many many that you can get every single
little brow hair and it also has fibers
on it that not only fill in the brows
but they grab onto the brow hairs and
make your brows look a little bit more
full so it's very easy to apply I'm just
going to start running it all over that
brow area and on days where I'm doing a
very natural look I don't like to take
my brow color all the way into the inner
corner so I'm not going to start here
and move out I kind of start right here
just a quarter of the way through and
then move out because if you get all
this area very dark it can sometimes
look very mean so instead we're just
going to start there and blend it upward
it was going to be exactly the other
brow I just love this product so much I
don't use too many benefit products but
this one is great brows are complete now
we are going to go in and just curl the
lashes I am using a Mac lash curler that
I've had
years and years and years from gratis
back in the day but I also used to have
a rebel mash curler before that and it
worked great so if you're looking for a
drugstore lash curler I would try the
Revlon one when I curl my lashes I get
in there very tight the lash line and I
just squeeze it a bunch of times i
pulsate it so I like squeeze squeeze
squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze
and I probably do that ten times there
are many different techniques to curling
the lashes but that's the one that I use
and you can see that it works I get some
very straight up then I'm going to go in
with the Maybelline pumped up colossal
volume express mascara I show this in my
Ulta haul video I absolutely love this
mascara I love the wand it's so nice and
full in fact I love fat wands but
especially when they come to a point
like that because it's not so big that
you're hitting yourself an eye with it
but yet you have that point so you can
get the inner corner of your lashes as
well I'm going to put on my mascara
pretty self-explanatory but I will give
you a little tip when applying your
mascara try to get as close to the group
as possible and move in a zigzag motion
the same way that you move when tweezing
tweezing teasing the root of your hair
next to your scalp it's the same
principle you know that sounds weird but
you're going to want to tease your hair
to get volume same thing for the lashes
so go back and forth and tease them to
really plump them up and because I don't
know how to apply mascara like a grown
woman sometimes I will get it on like
the upper lid or sometimes the lower
area what you want to do is just let it
dry leave it alone until you're
completely done with your makeup grab a
q-tip go back and just white and it will
completely come off and I'm just going
to coat the bottom lashes really quick
as well when you're in our curry this is
a great thing to do because no matter
how short your lashes are it will just
tend to make the eyes with a little bit
more open and awake so now I'm just
going to go in and finish off this look
by using a lip gloss I prefer the
glosses on days like today when I'm
wearing a very minimal makeup look just
because I think it looks a lot more
feminine and pretty as opposed to a more
flat lipstick so I am going to be going
in with a lip gloss that I just finished
creating and developing myself I teamed
up again with our cosmetics to create
one more lip gloss for you guys since
I went over so well and this is my baby
I love this lipgloss so much I'm
actually the only one that has this
right now it is going to be launching in
the next 24 hours on their website and
once it does I will let you guys know
and all social media I did name this
color
buttercream because it's buttery and
it's creamy it is absolutely beautiful
it's a baby pink color I just think it's
going to be gorgeous on pretty much
everybody you'll see what it looks like
right now I am so excited about this and
as always they have a light right here
and then a year right here so you can
look at yourself while you're applying
so you can see buttercream on my lips
right now I just think that it is such a
beautiful applause I'm not saying that
because I created it but I all love it I
did not create this applause I'm gonna
totally go buy it myself and if you guys
watch my channel you know that's true
because these colors are just my
absolute favorite these new baby paint
colors I just think they're beautiful
and so Universal so I'm so excited about
this lip gloss again I will link it
everywhere once it is actually launched
which will be sometime the next 24 hours
or so if there's no bumps in the road so
yeah that completes our no makeup makeup
look let me just zoom you in really
quick let me just get you in here
because if you like this entire video
the cameras and so far away and I want
you to see what this looks like up close
so hopefully the camera picks it up like
it does in person because in person this
foundation and bronzer looks so
beautiful it looks so natural it
honestly looks like my skin but just
better which is what everybody's looking
for in foundation right the bronzer
looks so natural it honestly just looks
like I've been out in the Sun all day
long and I'm just some kissed by laying
by the pool or something it's gorgeous
so as you can see nothing cakey nothing
over the top and nothing super glamorous
yet it is better than the situation we
had going on ten minutes ago so yeah I
really hope that you guys enjoy this no
makeup makeup look let me know how you
feel about in the comments below I
always love hearing your feedback any
requests you have for videos let me know
I love talking to you guys so yeah thank
you so much for watching I appreciate
you I love you all so much I will see
you the next couple of days
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
