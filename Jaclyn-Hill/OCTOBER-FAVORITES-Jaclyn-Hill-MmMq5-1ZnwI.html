my October favorites for you and before
jumping in the video I was going to say
that my next video shall be at my
skincare routine I know that it is the
most requested video on my channel right
now it's actually passed the point and
requested it is the most demanded video
on my channel right now and I see you I
got you I'm going to be filming that
this week on either Monday or Tuesday
depending No Tuesday or Wednesday
depending how my schedule goes so that
will be the next video but when I
mention on snapchat last night that I
was gonna be skipping my favorites and
just going straight to my skincare
routine I had a ton of you guys tweet me
asking me if I could please not skip my
favorites video that they're your
favorite videos to watch and of course I
want to give you guys what you want to
see so that is why I'm filming this
first and then I would take the time to
really film an in-depth skincare routine
there this week so that would be the
video you see next so be on the lookout
for that if you are one of those who
have been requesting the skincare
routine the fact that I'm doing my
October favorites right now just freaks
me out so much as why does time go by so
freaking fast as an adult like when I
was a little kid I felt like there was
six years in between each Christmas it
was like why can't it be Christmas and
now I think I blink and I'm putting that
damn Christmas shrimp again and it's
like and now I just celebrate another
birthday like I'm done like time just
goes by so fast now I just think I need
to stop and smell the roses because I
cannot believe that we are in November
like that is so freaky to me oh my gosh
so I'm sure there's a ton of you out
there that feel the exact same way as me
gonna be a kid again alright I'm gonna
stop babbling
but clearly I've missed you guys I
haven't filmed in almost two weeks cuz i
pre-recorded my last video so I could
upload it while I was out of town so I
miss you when I'm sorry I'm babbling but
if you don't like it there's like this
magical button that you can fast-forward
it and then I just stop talking hmm was
that too sappy the first things I'm
gonna talk about our foundation in the
first foundation I'm going to mention to
you guys I have mentioned before but
it's one of those products that I feel
like every single month I tell you like
new products like I love this and I love
that and you're like gosh girl like
every single month you have 15 new
favorite things like what about the
other things that you talked about last
month do you still enjoy those and what
I'm saying and just so you know when I
mentioned my favorites to you guys even
if you don't see me using them in every
single
illo talking about in every single month
if I mention a favorites to you guys I
am using that for a long period of time
I'm not just mentioning a favorite to
you because I tried it twice um like I
like this I'm going to put in my
favorites video you know I'm saying
they're actually products I genuinely
love and use for a long period of time
because I really do like them so anyways
this foundation right here I've
mentioned before but this is the B what
is this this is a co Jen do coach endo
Coach endo I believe it's called yes
coach endo well I mentioned this
probably a year and a half ago
originally and recently I have read
fallen in love with it it is the aqua
foundation and I just have to say I
forgot how much I love this foundation
because it is probably the most natural
foundation I've ever used in my life
it's definitely a shear to medium
coverage and a natural to kind of satin
finish so it just makes your skin look
so healthy like it's not matte but it's
not overly dewy and it's not too full
coverage and it's not too sheer it
really is just such a beautiful
foundation and this is a foundation I
would really recommend to someone if
let's say you're like 16 years old and
you have only used like tinted
moisturizer and you're a to switch to an
actual foundation that's what I would
suggest something like this for or let's
say you have really good skin and you're
not looking to cover up like acne or
like rosacea but you just want something
like light and fresh and natural the
aqua foundation from Co Gendo is so
beautiful I am in shade 143 in case
you're curious and I will link this down
below I know Sephora sells it but I will
link it for you because I know last time
a ton of you said you couldn't find it
so I will put that in my description box
so the next foundation is a Mac
foundation which can we just say which
is so crazy because when I worked at Mac
I worked there for four years and all I
ever wore was their foundation because
when you work there you're supposed to
only wear their makeup so when I left
Mac I felt like I was like a free woman
and I wanted to try all the new
foundations out there in the world so I
really haven't used Mac foundation in
years so I absolutely love this
foundation and this is the Mac
mineralized moisture SPF 15 foundation
this is a very dewy foundation which is
why I just love this foundations my
fairway where this is actually mixing
these two I love mixing my foundations I
always
because I feel like I am so picky when
it comes to makeup that I always want to
like manipulate my makeup to do exactly
what I want it to do for me so I love
mixing foundations I love mixing at full
coverage foundations more sheer
foundations and luminous ones with matte
ones to really like I feel like I'm like
in a lab like working things up a little
scientists but anyways I just love this
it's very dewy again like the cochon
though it's like a sheer to medium
coverage it just makes your skin look so
healthy that's what I'm wearing today
I'm wearing these to mix together all
over my face and I just love love them
both I've been feeling these more sheer
to natural looking foundations recently
weird right
Jaqueline not wanting to be a drag queen
did he'll freeze over next I have a
mascara and this is the l'oreal
voluminous carbon black mascara now this
has always been one of my favorite
mascaras in the drugstore I've used this
for years but the carbon black one is
really just so amazing because it's so
jet-black and the reason I really have
been using this like crazy at the past
five or six weeks is because when I put
on my lashes like my fake lashes
sometimes I'll notice like my real
lashes aren't that dark you can
sometimes see a difference and because
I'm a perfectionist I hate the way that
looks but this is so black since it's
the carbon black one then when you put
the mascara on in your natural lashes
and then put falsies on they really do
blend together and you cannot see a hint
of your natural lashes because it's so
black so I love this and I'd also like
the brush I think it's like just the
perfect everyday bla brush it's not too
skinny it's not too fat it's just a
great mascara so if you're looking for a
drugstore mascara I'd have to say that
this is one of my absolute favorites
especially in the carbon black I feel
like today's favorites are so random
normally I'm like I'm going to start
with eyes first and then move to lips
and today I have like one product from
each category of the face so I know it's
kind of everywhere but I'm sure you see
that by now so just try to keep up this
is an eye makeup remover that I again
mentioned this a long time ago a Sephora
employee threw this in my basket when I
was shopping there over a year ago and
told me that I would love it and she was
absolutely right this is pro this into
Travis eye
like I took to LA with me but I've gone
through like two or three about the
full-size ones and I love it because
it's inexpensive it's from the Sephora
brand but it's honest to god you guys
the best eye makeup remover I've ever
used like I know back in the day my mom
used to always use the Lancome one and
it's so oily that like if you want to
remove something like don't you dare
because you're gonna be able to put more
makeup on top of it later because like
it's like it removes your makeup and
makes your face so incredibly oily and
if it gets in your eyes it will burn
like a beyotch so I love this one
because it doesn't burn my eyes and it
doesn't leave an oily residue and it
really really really gets off your
makeup so I just love this I've
mentioned it before what if the product
eyes like I needed to mention again
because I use it every month almost
every day that I wear makeup but I don't
talk about that often so I kind of want
to remind you guys we're looking for a
good makeup remover look no further I've
not been using this for like three
months at least and this is the Laura
Mercier translucent powder right here
and look there's nothing you see hello I
am like on my trip me and Jackie were
like trying to bang this out because
there's nothing left in this so I want
to mention this because in the past
month or two I have literally gone
everyone in my life
on to the Laura Mercier translucent
bandwagon and every single person I
introduced to it is constantly telling
me like Jacqueline you don't understand
this how it has changed my life and what
I know and so I feel like since so many
of my friends and family have told me
how much I love this either guys need to
get on here again and like really come
back to tell you like this powder is
absolutely incredible I really can't
live without it I use it every something
that I do my makeup you guys saw my
foundation between how I used it in that
video and I just love it like it takes
your face to another level especially if
you use the baking method and you like
set it under your eyes or if you set it
under your contour it just makes your
skin so smooth but it doesn't uncover
too doesn't make you cakey it doesn't
give you that white cast when you use a
flash camera it's just such an amazing
powder and I highly recommend it to
anyone who was just looking to set their
makeup my friend Jackie is an oily B
Scott bless her and she's always trying
to find a way to combat the oil and when
we were in LA every single day we get
ready she did put aside five minutes
because your
bake me and I everyday we get ready to
sit there and bake her with the Laura
Mercier translucent powder and her oil
would not break through like she's
obsessed with it now so of course she
ran out and bought it so laura mercier
translucent powder Sam it's it's amazing
so now I talk about my lip combination
I'm wearing on my lips right now and
this is the one product that I'm going
to be honest I have only used twice so I
can't sit here and be that cool but at
the same time like when I know I like
something I know I like something it
doesn't take long and this is the
unreason see she's so beautiful
this is the honor easy collaboration
with lip Linda and this is the liquid
lipstick in the shade
she also has Brooklyn which is a coral
like red but bright intense and then she
has a Montenegro I believe it is just
like a dark purple I've not tried those
two yet I have them I haven't tried them
but reezy is a super beautiful nude
shade and that's what I'm wearing on my
lips right now with a gloss over top
which I'll talk about in a second but I
really really like this I think the
packaging is sexy it's very onerous
she's so beautiful you guys like when I
met her in person anasazi as party
that's my first time actually hanging
out with her in person she is so much
prettier like she's gorgeous on
Instagram I'm like every time she post a
picture I'm just like perfection but in
person she is even more beautiful like
she literally looks photoshopped in
person when she walked in I was like oh
my god she's gorgeous time to I'm
getting off topic but she is she's
really beautiful so anyways I really
really love the shade I think it's
gorgeous it's a great nude shade where
it's not so pale that you can't wear it
it doesn't look you powdered sugar
doughnut on your mouth but it's a
beautiful beautiful nude and then over
top of that I paired it with a Mac
mineralized gloss and I just bought this
I went to I don't know the locations in
LA I that place is so big there's so
many models I don't know em all I was
out to be honest but I went to Mac Pro
store there and I bought a mineralized
glass in the shade modest and that's
what I'm wearing over top of my lips
right now over top of Reesie and it's
just such a pretty very very nude gloss
like you can see it barely has any color
and whatsoever but that's what I love
about it is it just has
little bit of nude so this is a gloss
you can wear if you barely have any
makeup on or if you have a ton of makeup
on you can wear this gloss because it's
just glossy and I'm always saying I'm on
the search for glossy glosses and the
mineralized glosses are very very wet
looking which I love
I think the mineralized glosses by Mac
and the Marc Jacobs new glosses are my
two favorite at the moment for sure
because they both look so glossy on the
lips but the Marc Jacobs takes to win
because they have a cap a permit scent
that I love okay so one more lip thing
which I've been using now for about two
months ever since it came out and I just
love it
it actually comes in a pack it comes
with a lip exfoliator and then it comes
with a little oyster Iser and these are
both by glam glow and I don't think you
can buy them separately but I want them
to make it so you can buy them
separately because the exfoliating one I
haven't even tried I'm not going to be a
Michael I to you I bought specifically
for this because I love glam glow so
much I knew that I would be in love with
their what is this lip balm um but I'm
not a big like lip exfoliator person I
can't help it my whole life I've always
been like what's the point when you're
exploiting your face just exfoliate your
lips but that's just me and not saying
it doesn't work that's just me I feel
like I don't have time for that I don't
have time to be sitting here like
exfoliating my lips when I'm saying but
I love this lip balm so much it is soaps
hi Frankie
hi oh my gosh look at you just making
your way in hello you want to say hi
come here oh my goodness you haven't
said hi to them a long time he was he hi
did you just wake up from in now okay
say bye say bye to the people love you
anyways back to our scheduled
programming so this is called the pout
mud wet lip balm treatment and I've been
using this every single or I go to bed
and I have to say it's my favorite lip
moisturizer pretty much I've ever used
um there's a Korres lip butter that I
love just as much I love the color that
that one has but this one is absolutely
no color whatsoever and it honestly
feels like gloss and it smells
like peppermint but it doesn't tangle
your lips and make it look super tingly
but you can see right there like it does
look glossy and it is just so
moisturizing it is insane like I apply a
generous amount of this at night before
I go to bed when I wake in the morning
my lips just so moisturize I've been
using this for two months and there's
still a ton of products in there so I
just I've been loving this I think it's
one of the best lip moisturizer I've
ever used it actually moisturize my lips
I always wake up it's ridiculous even
right from toxic before I go to bed
I'll wait in the next morning and I'll
have like kind of cracky peeling skin on
my lips cuz I am dry and this I'm not
joking is one of the own lip balms
there's probably three and there this is
one of the only balms that actually
makes it so my lips do not do that
anymore so thank you glam glow so I want
to mention this palette just because of
the fact that it's a pretty big deal for
me and I haven't mentioned it yet I
briefly showed it in my zombie mouth
video but like I feel like that wasn't
enough and it's so exciting that I
started to mention it and this is the
champagne glow palette by Becca you can
see it has my signature right there
because it does feature champagne pop
which is why they called it
champagne below because the palate is
supposed to kind of revolve around
champagne pop so we have pearl right
there champagne pop and then blushed
copper and pearl and champagne pop I mix
these two together pretty much every day
and that's how I've been doing my
highlight for months now off camera
there was a couple maybe like six to
eight weeks ago I was like I'm using a
highlight and I can't tell you guys what
it is
that was pearl that's what I was using
tons of people were like you're
developing your own no no no it was
pearl I absolutely love this color and
champagne pop mixed together there's so
gorgeous I'll show you champagne pop on
its own right oh okay so there is pearl
next to champagne pop so champagne pop
and purple and then I'm going to mix
them together so you guys can see when
to become one so that right there is
champagne pop and pearl mix and you can
see it's just a more vanilla lighter
version of champagne pop which I adore
and then blush copper this is a blush
copper is a blush overlay so this is
something that you want to wear on the
apples of the cheeks and it's gorgeous
it's a beautiful copper II kind of
bronzy shapes
that one you just want to put right here
on the apples and the other two are
highlight to the top of the cheeks and
all three of these shades are
limited-edition pearl is not permanent
champagne pop is not permanent and blush
copper is not permanent so these are all
three limits condition nice when I say
thank you so much every single day
dialogue okay my sweatpants are
officially destroyed I've literally just
been sitting here rubbing everything on
my sweatpants casually talking to him
like no big deal um my bracing all day
that I log into my Twitter I'm just
overwhelmed with the love and the
support from you guys a champagne glow
palette and even though I didn't create
this palette and the only thing in this
that's mine is the champagne pop it's
still just like you guys have kept the
champagne pop like sorry so amazing and
hyped and excited and I'm just I could
cry right now I'm just so blessed to
have you guys and you're just so special
to me and every single time I log onto
social media and I see the support from
you guys it just means the world to me
seriously I I'm just so damn lucky to
have you and I want to thank you for
that and I didn't want a video to go by
without me just show you the palette and
telling you how much I appreciate you
and even those of you I've gotten to
meet some you guys telling me like I
can't afford the palette but I want to
tell you a problem of you that means
just as much to me than you going out
and buying it you know like just the
fact that like you're saying that you're
proud of me and you're happy for me and
you feel a connection to me like it
means the world you guys it really does
so I just love you so much and I'm just
very thankful for you guys giving me all
these opportunities so yeah okay next
this is the Tarte Amazonian clay blush
palette and it is called bling it on and
can we talk about the packaging this
gives me life every year they come out
with a palette like this and I get
excited for every year I have them in my
collection because it becomes like a
collector's item and a little better gun
of you this is the coolest one so far so
inside you will see five blushes that
look like this this is the only blush
thing I took with me to LA I was there
for seven days and this is all I took
which I'm not gonna lie while I was
there I was like I wish I would have
brought on coral with me because this
palette has everything except like a
really bomb coral but still like I'm not
going to complain these blushes are so
pigmented they're beautiful even I swear
into shade the only one that I don't
the palette is this one that's called
beaming when we hold it properly beaming
right here because it has straight
glitter in it it's like kind of chunky
glitter it's not shimmer but it's
glitter and I don't like glittery
blushes um but these four are just
beautiful like you like a mob like a
more brownie taupe you have a baby pink
and then you have a little bit more rosy
pink so gorgeous if you're looking for a
good blush palette look no further
Amazonian clay blushes bling it on
palette bomb what else do I have this is
something I've been using since my last
trip to LA because I was there stay with
my friend and she had this on her
nightstand and she totally sold me on it
and just told me how much I needed it
and I have used it ever since this is
actually my second tube of this in the
past three months and this is the locket
Ain okay I feel like no one knows how to
actually pronounce this some people call
it a la Petain some people call it lots
of time some people call it what else
have I heard it called I don't know how
to pronounce it you guys just one of
those things like I'm okay with sounding
stupid when it comes to how to pronounce
this name but anyways it is their foot
cream and it says on here it is 15% shea
butter for dry skin foot cream this okay
I have a problem with my feet being dry
I hate the feeling at night when you get
into bed and you put your feet into your
clean sheets and you can feel dry skin
on your feet but whew I definitely have
like sensory issues when it comes to
certain textures and there's nothing
worse to me than dry feet on clean
sheets it's so disturbing and so my
entire life I've voice dried my feet
before I got into bed every night but
even still like my feet are so dry that
I'll wake up like three hours later they
call my feet are dry again but this is
the only foot cream I've ever used in my
life that actually keeps my feet
moisturize throughout the whole night
let me just tell you between the glam
glow lip stuff and this foot cream I
have been so moisturizing the night I'm
sleeping like a baby okay like it's it's
been a good life for the past couple of
weeks
so this foot cream is legit it is so
good it's so moisturizing it doesn't
leave an oily residue but yet it's like
sick enough that it's like a butter it
doesn't have a nasty texture it's just
bombed it mom I would love to mention
some morphe brushes to you guys because
I'd fall in love with a few this month
but because a morphe favorites is so
highly requested
going to save those brushes and I'm
going to film a video for you guys and
like a week or two of all my favorite
morphe brushes for you guys to kind of

jacket like you can see that she like
strategically placed these studs like
the entire jacket details and like the

ring and the Wrentham in the shoes like

I've been absolutely in love with
because I swear I predict that this song
is going to be like in the top five on
Billboard within no time I follow
Pia Mia I think her name is or maybe
it's like Princess Pia on Instagram and
I was laying in bed one early morning
when I woke up in LA and I was just like
going through it and
Dean and I saw that she posted like a
short little video on Instagram of like
a clip of her new song and I was like um
this sounds good and I've never actually
heard her music before I just follow her
because let's get real she's freaking
gorgeous and I'm like oh beautiful and
so I ran to iTunes I download the song
so I'm like I don't know this is gonna
be bomb and I felt so in love with a
song
I have inflated it like 10 times a day
every day and it's only been out for
like six days and I already know every
single word to it because I listen to it
so much like I can't get out of the song

best fee I'm so into this new music

birthday which was um she took me on
July 21st I believe it was so go see Sam
Smith in concert and I will always love
Sam Smith that's why she took me but
when I heard this song live like I just
bawled my eyes out
and my mom was like that's your song

like it was such an emotional moment and
ever since then like it's been my
favorite song I play it every day and
I'm feeling down and so I'm trying to
push me to do something that I don't
want to do whatever it comes to it this
