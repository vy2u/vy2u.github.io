October favorites and I know I have not
made a video in like ten days and I am
so sorry and no I am not neglecting my
channel or you guys I love you just as
much it's just honestly life has gotten
in the way the past ten days it has been
absolute craziness and it's just been
hectic and a lot has gone on so I'm not
gonna bore you guys who don't care I
will leave a short novel for the ones of
you who do and down the description by
heart of what has been going on the past
ten days it's just been insane oh and
first of all this background is not
permanent I'm at my mom's house right
now and this is like the only
opportunity I've had to film so put up
the camera and let's do it so first
thing I want to talk about are these two
lip products I have been absolutely
obsessed with obviously that's why
they're in this video and the first one
is a limited edition Mac lipstick which
is called flair for finery this came out
in the holiday collection last month
that's why it has the gold packaging as
opposed to the normal silver it is just
a beautiful basic neutral shade it has
the perfect amount of pink and beige in
it I'm assuming that is sold out online
just because anytime Mac comes out with
a great nude it sells out within minutes
I'm sure you can't find it at a local
counter or store though I do own what I
feel like is to be hundreds of nude
lipsticks and this one really stands out
to me it's just it's gorgeous I
absolutely love it and I have been
pairing that a lot with this Marc Jacobs
the gloss called studded kiss you can
see that it's just this really pretty
raspberry shade Marc Jacobs did come out
with a makeup line at Sephora about two
or three months ago if I'm not mistaken
and I have been liking a lot of things
from his line so far I'm his applause I
felt like straight vanilla oh my gosh
they smell so good and you can taste it
when you're wearing them they're amazing
so this color right here is this really
pretty raspberry shade I just love it
for fall I think it's the perfect amount
of purple and a lip gloss that's not
like stand out purple where the everyday
woman can't wear it cuz it's like whoa
what are you wearing so I have been
mixing the two which is what I just did
on my hand
that's the nude lipstick from before and
the raspberry gloss that I just put on
top of it it's actually what I'm wearing
on my lips right now are these two mixed
together
and I love that if you put a little bit
more of this you get it more purple and
a little bit more of this you get it
more nude I just I
it's been my favorite mixture of any lip
products throughout the entire month I
have found a new favorite highlighter of
mine which is a very big deal because I
am so picky about highlighters and this
is the Smashbox masterclass 2 palette
and I'm sorry if I'm blinding you this
is very shiny um I did do a blog post
about my favorite palettes at the moment
and this was one of them that I
mentioned I guess if you don't follow me
on Twitter and Facebook you wouldn't
know that I even have a blog so if
you're interested in that I will link it
down below so you guys can go check that
out I just post randomly about things
that I've been loving and just random
stuff that comes to my mind when it
comes to beauty products um so anyways I
would spend every penny on this palette
just for this page alone I mean the
eyeshadows they're great but seriously I
cannot get enough of this these blushes
are so fully pigmented it is incredible
so this is the highlighter right down
here and there's literally no name for
it it's just called shimmer and I'm like
okay but it is absolutely gorgeous I
want them to make it you know into an
individual highlighter I don't think
they do but it is the perfect amount of
pink and beige and silver all in one
highlighter I typically gravitate more
towards pinky baiji highlighters as
opposed to gold ones because they
usually look better on a more wide
selection of skin tones as opposed to
gold ones usually they just look better
on a certain complexion I have mentioned
this in a video this is the Too Faced a
few of my favorite things I can't talk
today it's been so long since I felt I
love everything about this palette as
well I love the packaging I think
there's a cutest thing ever it's the
first thing I was drawn to I love the
gold metallic inside I love it it has
the chocolate Soleil bronzer here I love
this blush and then all the colors that
you get I mean you get neutrals greens
Purple's blues pinks
I mean you get everything in here that
you could need I just absolutely love
this palette I've been using it a lot
another palette this is much more
recently purchased I just got this this
last week and this is the lorac a little
black palette I walked into Sephora and
I was like oh my god
you guys know that I love shimmery light
colors I love warm colors so this was
perfect obviously this is just a very
small palette that is not going to be
something that you're gonna be able do
an entire look with it's a very basic
but I just love the shades
wearing two of them on my eyes today so
they're the shades right there you can
see how pigmented they are
I love how warm and coppery they are and
that dark color is absolutely gorgeous
so it's basically just a gradient from
light to dark with four basic shades
that are very shimmery so once again you
will need other colors to blend them out
that are more matte I just absolutely
love love this palette I love how warm
they are and how coppery and orange E is
just very fall appropriate this is a
total Rando but this is a makeup forever
eye shadow and I believe it's number 162
it looks like this it is just this
gorgeous chocolate brown shade I just
love this I've been using it all month
long just you can see how pigmented it
is like there's no like spot genus a lot
of times when you're working with matte
shades they can be really choppy but you
can see how smooth that goes on it
almost goes on like it is a shimmer it's
just beautiful I just love how warm and
chocolatey it is it's not actually red
but it's not a cool tone it's just that
mid tone beautiful warm shade I actually
have a little bit under my eye today I
use it to blend out my shadow I use it a
lot of times in my crease just to make
anything a little bit more deep I
absolutely love this color so I believe
it's number 162 I'm not too familiar
with makeup forever eyeshadows so I will
list that information down below and
I'll make sure that I'm actually correct
I got this val was in Chicago I'm not
sure if it was limited edition you can
see that there are so many pretty warm
colors and this you have like a burgundy
you're like an orange e and a peachy
they're just beautiful and then you have
this logo going through it it's embossed
and that has some gold shimmer in it so
I'll blend it together which is how I do
it it looks like this right here it's
just this beautiful coppery just warm
blush shade I've really really been
liking this I don't know if it's limited
edition it did come in this packaging so
I have a feeling it's limited I'm not
totally positive though but it's just
absolutely beautiful I love it and if
you don't want to mix it all together
like this with your brush when you first
get it these colors right here are more
individual and you can just kind of spot
it and go in for an individual look but
I just like the way it look all mixed
together so that's totally all on you I
just love it I think it's so gorgeous
it's the perfect amount of pea
and pink and bronze for fall I just I
love it
did I say I love it because I love it a
new contour shade that I have been using
all month long I've actually been loving
it this is the studio care blend pressed
powder by Mac this is technically a face
powder or a setting powder whatever you
want to use it for I have been using it
as a contour shade though I was an
employee there when this came out at the
MAC store and I learned so much about it
and I just absolutely loved it from the
beginning and there's a beautiful
setting powder for those of you who
don't want to use it as a contour or a
bronzer it is any velvet matte finish so
it is matte but it's a natural matte it
just looks so beautiful and natural it's
like they referred to it as like not
your grandma's powder it's not like that
chalky old-school 80s finish it's so
natural and beautiful so I was kind of
getting sick of using the exact same
hoola bronzer every day so I wanted to
find something else that I loved so I
thought about how much I love this
powder and I got it in shade dark and
that is my contour story I just
absolutely love it it's so so so easy to
blend because it's made for the face
that is this shade right there so you
can see that it is more of a terracotta
undertone I am wearing it right now as a
contour Wow these lights are making my
contour look like whoo moving on I have
two skincare products and the first one
is this fresh sea berry oil this is the
moisturizing face oil with omegas 3 6 7
&amp;amp; 9 100% pure moisture with sea
buckthorn oil I was actually in Sephora
in Chicago and there was this big wall
of all the oils like cleansing oils face
oils body oils and then I had it
pinpointed for what therefore exactly
and like dozy Marilyn was sitting there
the 100% pure argan oil and it said I
forgot what it said exactly but then
this one said for deepest hydration and
I was like ooh what's that because I'm
very dry so I'm always looking for
something that is going to really
moisturize me so I just bought it on a
whim and I have not used my josie maran
once since I got this just to be honest
for the people out there who have dry
skin oh my gosh this is absolutely
amazing my skin has not gotten sensitive
from it whatsoever has not broken me out
or clogged any pores I actually love it
I've been putting on every single night
before bed and when I wake up and I wash
my face my skin is still feeling
moisturize still feeling like it's
looking like it's glowing and my makeup
goes on so smooth
so I am obsessed with you you have no
idea like till death do me apart so this
is fresh Seabury moisturizing face oil I
posted a photo of this product on
Instagram like five or six months ago I
got so many questions about it and I
never actually talked about it so I'm
sorry but it is the glam glow youth mud
face mask this is the pink one for
Breast Cancer Month breast cancer
awareness month which was in October and
that's when I got this one um the
original one that I had is just in a
white packaging so basically this is the
best mask in the entire world it's
absolutely amazed us I can't say enough
good things about it it is a small jar
and you get a small amount for the price
it is like in the $60 range but it is
worth every single pretty penny it is
absolutely amazing it exfoliates it
tightens it brightens reduces pores
pulls out impurities and dirt and toxins
while still leaving your natural oils in
the skin it helps reduce excess oil it
literally does everything you can think
of so I use it like once a week
it is a savior when I feel like little
bumps coming like yesterday I use it
because I had a few breakouts and I'm
not joking I woke up this morning and my
breakouts were gone it just pulls
everything to the surface if you have
like a pimple and a blemish that it's
just like there but it hasn't come to a
head yet you put this on spot treat it
and it will bring that out it is
absolutely amazing they do have a coupon
code right now I'm not sure what it is
so I'll list it down below I just saw
that they have it and it's for glam glow
products
um and it's 30% off I believe on all
glam glow products so I will find that
information and list it down below it's
not my coupon code so I don't know about
it but still I think that's awesome 30%
off so I'll have all that information
down there for you so you can go look at
glam glow for yourself I think I'm going
to use the the discount to get the eye
treatment because it also has an eye
treatment that I'm really interested in
anyways so last beauty product this is a
deborah lippmann nail polish it is in
the shade modern love long story short I
had a very big issue with my nails and
it had to be fixed immediately so it's
at Sephora I saw this color I actually
love it it's the perfect nude where it's
not too nude it's on my nails right now
but I don't wanna show you my nails up
close because it's a hot mess right now
so don't judge
I just love it it's the perfect amount
of nude where it's not too pale it's got
a little bit of purple and a little bit
of gray in it I just really really love
it so that is called modern love if
you're in the market to buy an
overpriced nail polish boo maybe it's
technically a lacquer though and I will
say for the price that I was I am
extremely happy with it it's very smooth
it goes on nice and thick and dries fast
I really really do like Deborah Lippmann
you guys may think this is a little
weird but I have to talk about it
because I've been loving it so much all
month long so it isn't called sensi okay
some of you I'm sure are like oh god
here she goes and others of you probably
thinking what is that so I will list
information about it down below I do
believe it's one of those things where
you have to purchase it through a
certain person and you can't just get on
the website so I'll find some way to
help you guys out and I'll link it all
down below
basically it's little waxes like you buy
these boxes of wax for like five dollars
and they smell amazing and then you put
it up here in the top and then you turn
this light and it melts it will make
your house smell so much more potent
than any candle could ever possibly do
it is amazing here let me get creepy and
show you guys yep this is happening so
you can see that it just lights up like
a nightlight it just looks so cute and
charming in your house I absolutely love
it and this light down there will melt
the wax up here in top and then when
you're done you can just scrape this out
get rid of it or wait for it to melt
away and then put in a new scent but I
just absolutely love this stuff I do
love my candles I burn candles all the
time but I love this if you find a scent
you really enjoy it's just gonna make
your entire house or your bathroom or
whatever room you choose just to smell
like it 24/7 it's just it's awesome all
right so that is it for my October
favorites I really hope you guys enjoy
I'm going to put every single product
down below I'm going to put links to
where you can find them I will make sure
that I get the glam glow discount code
for you guys and we'll sit down there
for you for the 30% off and if I can
find any other discount codes I'll make
sure to list that so I really hope you
guys enjoy this video and I will see you
