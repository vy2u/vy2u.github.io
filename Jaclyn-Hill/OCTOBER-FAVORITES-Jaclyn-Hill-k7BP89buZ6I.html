to be doing a my up did you see that
little I psyche how to show off my
shoulder highlight real quick girls like
I'm gonna be doing like casually I was
gonna be like casually doing ya know my
October favorites ya know I hate that
I'm filming with like a baseball cap hat
whatever you want to call it because I
feel like it shades my face or like
angled my light so hopefully you can see
my face I might be talking like this the
whole time so you can see me but I try
to take it off and girl there's like a
very obvious line of demarcation of
where like my foundation ends and it
just becomes like reality not cute it
feels good to be just sitting here with
you guys talking a little bit more chill
than it has been recently I don't know
maybe I have done chill videos and I
can't think of that I'm just my life has
just been so crazy recently in business
and personal life like normally it's one
or the other and recently it has been
both like to the absolute extreme it's
just been so crazy and like sitting down
here on camera with just this just like
regular background just honestly feels
so good to sit here and not feel any
pressure it just feels good I love you
guys and I miss you guys even though I
didn't go anywhere I just miss you I do
I talk about all the time I miss the
good old days I miss when YouTube was
just so chill you know there's a
difference between then and now I miss
it and I'm thankful for those of you
that are still there for me even though
you guys don't know what's going on in
my life you guys don't know you know
anything the good the bad the ugly still
it's just I always feel like you guys
are there for me I'm just so thankful
for what we have here thankful for you
guys so uh you know so we're going to
talk about Hartford good second and
let's jump in to my favorites okay so
first thing I wanna talk about is a
primer and this is by a girl on I've
seen this cycling around YouTube for the
past month or so and I first originally
saw talked to you from glam life guru
recommend this I'm pretty sure she named
this her ride-or-die primer and her
rudder
I'm pretty sure that's where I saw that
I put on my list to buy if I really
trust her recommendation on
recommendations plural it has gold
flakes in it so it is way more expensive
I don't really know if the gold flakes
actually do anything I'm just being
honest but this is very very nice I love
that it's a gel when it goes onto the
skin it gives like this really nice kind
of cooling effect and it definitely
gives a tightening effect after its
applied I've been mixing it with the LC
pearl radiance primer which is just me
being so ridiculously high maintenance
but I just love both of them so much and
I want the benefits from both of them so
if you guys are in the market for a
really expensive primer that's infused
with gold flakes that I would definitely
recommend this one Ness is a lipstick
that I have been loving and this is by
Charlotte Tilbury and it's in the shade
Kim K w I'm pretty sure she made it
after Kim Kardashian or Kim Kardashian
like picked the color or something like
that cuz I saw Kim talk about I think on
snapchat it was maybe it's a really nice
nude it's what I'm wearing right now on
my lips underneath of a gloss let me
give you a little swatches just in case
you need a more accurate look of it
right here it's a really nice beige e
pinky and nude I mean honestly I have so
many pinky nudes at this point it's like
ridiculous but to me they're all
different
it's so weird and like a couple of weeks
ago I lined up all my favorite news and
it was a twenty nude lipsticks and I
swapped them all my arm and there was
only two of them that we're basically
the same the rest of them all look
different to me I was like no this one's
a bit more peach this has a little pink
like I could see the difference so I was
like okay after looking at it I like I'm
not that crazy
alright cuz to me they don't all look
the same and that's because they're not
more than anything I love this color as
for the actual lipstick it is very very
creamy and I would say it's a a medium
coverage it's not a full coverage
lipstick it's more of a medium coverage
very creamy so it's really nice for just
everyday wear you are gonna have to
reapply it a lot I just love this color
this rose gold color so for eight you
are gonna have to reapply it a lot
because it is a long wearing lipstick
it's not super duper opaque and it's not
super duper full coverage but it's a
really great every day nude lipstick I
feel like I'm like talking so much say
I'm all over the place hopefully you
guys are keeping up with me this is a
gloss by anastacio and I think I've
talked about this before in the past but
I've kind of refine in love with it this
and this is in the shade undressed and
the reason I have been loving this is
because it has more of like a peachy
brownish undertone in it for a nude the
loss but it's not it's not too round
because like sometimes I wanted to a
really kind of round Toby toffee coffee
color with it but on my days where I
want to do a nude like nude lip because
I'm where like darker smokey eyes and I
want a new lip but I still want it to be
kind of fall appropriate I love
undressed by anastasiya because it does
have a more kind of caramel undertone to
it so it's kind of like a really fall
appropriate nude as opposed to a more
pinky nude that would be more springtime
technically so I've been wearing this a
lot this month by itself and over top of
shades just similar to like the
Charlotte Tilbury one right here I've
really been loving this gloss another
gloss I have been loving all month but I
have to say I kind of have a love-hate
relationship with this next product
because I've been using it constantly
but there's times where I'm like oh my
god it's driving me crazy but then
there's other times where it's
perfection and it is the Sisley lip
gloss in the shade one diamond it looks
like this I believe it was Jeffrey star
that talked about this in a video and
then I was like okay I think I need that
and it's literally just a clear kind of
crystal shimmery it's got Sparkle it's
got little flecks of glitter it doesn't
add any color to the lips it just adds
it a really beautiful angelic Sheen
glitter to the lip reason I'm saying I
have a love-hate relationship with it is
because it has to be worn alone like
completely alone is what I've discovered
because if you mix it with another gloss
or if you layer over top of a lipstick
it kind of gets fussy and starts
breaking up like it needs to be worn all
by itself like this gloss is a little
bitch like it wants to be the star of
the entire show okay so last lip product
that I have to talk about is the Hooda
Beauty liquid matte lipsticks so this is
the only one I've actually worn I bought
four colors and this is in the shade
vixen this color is gorgeous
look at that color they smell like cocoa
powder
they smell like like before you make
yourself like I'm not chocolate before
you make yourself hot cocoa and the
power to choose it from Nestle that's
they smell like I love the formula this
is definitely and one of the top
formulas now I have not tried all of
them I have these three other shades
right here that I haven't even opened up
yet but I love the packaging like
everything that she does I just think
it's so cool as far as the packaging
like her lashes are so cool this is so
cool are those lips not like amazing
like hi
are you joking it's so beautiful I
cannot wait to try the rest of the
colors and buy more colors because
hopefully they're all is great as vixen
was so Becca cosmetics came out they
knew powder and it's called the
multitasking perfecting powder and they
said that it's supposed to be able to do
anything like highlighting contouring
setting the whole face whatever it may
be and it comes in like a little compact
like this not like a big one like
they're highlighters do it like a little
mini one and this one right here in the
shade warm honey
I cannot find the other color that I use
and it's driving me insane I think it's
called tan I could be making that up
right now I'll be honest I think it's
called tan though I've been using these
to contour and bronze recently and I
absolutely love them the consistency is
just like oh my god they're just so
opaque and they're just so buttery and
smooth I mean that swatch isn't going to
tell you anything but they're so buttery
and they're so smooth they're so easy to
blend like when I got them I open them
up and I felt them all like oh I'm gonna
like this like I knew the second I
touched the powder that I was going to
love it and I have it I've been using
them constantly all month long to bronze
and contour my face and I just think
they're beautiful you guys have to know
that I'm about to talk about this right
this is the 3/5 e palette and it's what
I have been using to highlight it's what
I have on my face right now as my
highlighter it's all I'm wearing I mixed
this color in this color right here to
highlight my cheekbones and my shoulders
as well and like a little bit on my nose
that's what I got going on I love this
so much they are so crazy pigmented and
like look at that that pigment does not
lie honestly you saw there was one
little swipe
it's no joke they're so pigmented this
one right here is like white as snow
look if I use this I have to be my
absolute fairest like no spray tan in
sight and I have to mix it with
something because it is fair so if you
are a girl who's very light in skin and
you cannot find a color to highlight you
I bet this one right here will do
oh yeah it's beautiful I miss all them
together when I'm a little bit darker
and I have a spray tan I will start
mixing this row and as well I'll mix
these two together and use it as blush
it's it's beautiful you guys
don't even think of this as an eyeshadow
palette honestly I mean I haven't to
touch these bottom three rows even
though there's some really pretty colors
in there I just think of this as a
highlight palette it's the 3/5 e by
morphe again and it's what I've been
using all month to highlight I mean I'm
not gonna lie I'm a champagne pop with
it constantly because what kind of sign
like I kind of like champagne pop and a
little bit and okay so let's move on to
some other random things because I am
done with makeup so let's move on to
other other items so the first one is
this Dyson blow-dryer okay you guys this
is like so ridiculously expensive i sat
there on the Dyson website like should I
really buy this is it really worth it
but I had so many people tell me that it
was such a game-changer I don't think
okay fine like and I hate my hair so
much I'm like basically willing to do
anything I actually have in tape and
extensions right now and I love them
which I'm kind of mad at myself I don't
have my hair down so I could like kind
of show you like what they look like and
like the process and stuff but whatever
it is what it is it's not good under the
hood anyways um when I was in LA I did a
podcast with Heather Dubrow if you guys
watch Real Housewives of Orange County
then you will definitely know who she is
she was so sweet and so great and she
mentioned this blow-dryer niche that do
you have a new Dyson blow-dryer and I
was like no and she was like oh my gosh
you need it and I was like okay what the
hell I have tomorrow cuz her hair looks
gorgeous so I was like I need this it
blow dries your hair so fast it is
insane it has so many different levels
you push these two buttons right here
and you can go up to like I think it's
like six different levels maybe it's
intense and it just comes out of this
hole like right here just blows out of
this hole god this just sounds so sexual
like I'm humiliated right now the point
is I love this because it gets my hair
dry so stinkin fast like I can't even
believe it is the fastest my hair has
ever been dried in my entire life if you
get online you'll see all the bougie
benefits that come along with this all I
know is my hair looks really shiny and a
blow dries like a couple of seconds I
mean that's dramatic don't actually
believe that but it blow dries it pretty
damn fast okay so my next favorite is
going to be or the most random things
that I've ever taught
about my channel but here's a little
story that you don't know about me is if
you don't personally know me if you know
me you know this already but I am
obsessed with personal hygiene and I
have wanted to create what I'm about to
show you guys for years I've had the
idea of this for years and you know how
like sometimes you'll get ideas and
you'll be like why hasn't that been
invented yet I shall look into getting a
patent yeah and you just don't do it
that's the story of my life with these I
was shopping what like a month a month
and a half ago and I was like Rachel oh
my god and I picked these up and they
are called the good wipes so they are
body wipes for when you can't shower you
don't even know how happy this makes my
soul even though I will no longer be
able to be the first person to come up
with this idea I am so in love with
these little guys okay so basically if
you can't shower throughout the day like
I'm not saying you can use these to skip
a shower because no you need to shower
you need to have good hygiene I am
obsessed with being clean not feeling
sticky having fresh breath brushing your
teeth flossing when I'm obsessed with
just taking care of yourself so this is
for those of you who are out all day
can't get home and alade to take a
shower even if like you have to go to
the gym and then go straight to get your
nails done afterwards and you just don't
feel fresh you don't have time to take a
full-on shower you grab these they are
all natural it says it has tea tree oil
cooling peppermint revitalizing ginseng
they're hypoallergenic no alcohol no
parabens no added fragrance so they're
not bad for you they're not filled
alcohol or parabens you can use them to
wipe off your underarms anywhere on your
entire body if you know what I mean it
just helps you get through the next
couple of hours until you get to a
shower and they just feel so good
they've got a very slight cooling
sensation not too much but if you're hot
and like you're sweaty you're sticky it
just feels so good because the natural
peppermint that's in it it's bomb you
guys I'm obsessed I bought so many boxes
of them so now anytime I with anybody
and they're like someone's like oh yeah
I think I might smell it like girl I got
you I'm like making it rain with my
wipes this is a candle from West almond
this is a new one it has not been lit
yet and I have bought this last year and
I think the year before I think and it
is in the scent shimmering balsam and
this is the metallic crackle jar and
just so beautiful I have a bigger one at
my house and when you light it at night
like with this mercury glass it just
like shimmers and sparkles and it just
looks so romantic and pretty and the
scent is the perfect winter scent it
smells very similar to the bath and
Bodyworks winter candle it just smells
like Christmas trees and just people
Christmas caroling it just smells like
such winter is so Christmassy I love it
so much and I'm already burning all my
Christmas candles like I don't even care
I am ready I am done with summer I'm
done with the heat I'm ready I have been
beyond obsessed with Express
sweaters this month like you don't even
know I check Express his website like
every couple of months kind of keep up
and see what's going on and I don't know
I kind of fell off the wagon the past
two years I wasn't really impressed by
much I wasn't really digging it but this
fall season girl if you have not gone on
there and looked at their sweaters they
have got some bomb fall sweaters like I
feel like all the sweaters that I see on
Pinterest I'm like I want that they're
all unexpressed right now so this one
right here is my number one favor and
it's the one I want to show you guys I
have it in two different colors I have
it in black and then like this tan shade
right here which is so funny
if they actually posted a picture on
Instagram a couple weeks ago wearing
this sweater with this hat that's so
funny I did not even plan that so I do
get them in a bigger size I'm normally a
small and this I got a medium and then
the black one I got in a large I haven't
worn the black one it still has the tab
on it I just love it it's like the ideal
chunky sweater it can fall off the
shoulder or you can keep it upright and
it hits at a nice flattering place on
the body too like it doesn't crop too
high or hang down SuperDuper low like it
kind of hits me like at the very bottom
like of my butt cheek sorry to meet you
descriptive but you know like when
you're wearing leggings like you don't
want a sweater that's too short you know
but then again I do have a tort like a
really short torso and I really long
legs for my body type like a really
short stomach so it might hit me lower
than other people because I will say
like this section of me like like I've
always wanted to like put it in a taffy
polar instruction okay so now for my
very last favorite which is a fashion
item as well
and I have talked about these on my blog
and both snapchat but I know that I have
some people they'll only watch my
YouTube videos that don't follow me on
those areas so I wanted to you know
share with you guys as well and these
are booties by Steve Madden and let me
just say right now these have got to be
some of the best booties I've ever tried
on or worn in my entire life number one
they are so comfortable like the heel
isn't crazy crazy high but it's not too
short and it's nice and chunky so like I
have worn these for hours and hours and
hours and I my feet we're not sore at
all but keep in mind I do wear heels
pretty often so I am used to a little
bit of height but still like my feet did
not hurt at all whatsoever throughout
the entire day and what I love so much
about them is the ankle oh my god I
cannot even tell you how much I love the
ankle of the shoe I literally bought
them in every single color that come in
I bought them in this tan shade right
here like it's such a good tan too it
doesn't have like a grey or pinky
undertone or like a purpley undertone
it's just such a good true tain't like I
love it and then I also bought it in a
burgundy which I have at my house and
then I bought it in this blue velvet
velvet is one of like the top trends
going on right now in fashion and when I
saw these like I died I haven't even put
together an outfit for them yet but I'm
so excited like I'm not kidding if they
came out of another 15 colors I probably
buy every single one of them because
here's the thing with me is everyone
always comments saying I really big feet
like whenever I post like outfit of the
days or just outfit like pictures of me
wearing like shoes everyone's always
like your feet are so big and my feet
are a size eight and if I like if the
shoes run small we're like eight eight
and a half sometimes but my ankles are
so skinny you guys I've hated them my
entire life my mom has the exact same
ankle doesn't mean whenever I wear boots
I always make fun of my ankles and I say
that it looks like to a toothpick
sticking out of the shoes because
they're just so tiny and it's like it's
not like my legs are tiny it's just my
ankles that are tiny and then I have
like really really really skinny feet so
it makes my feet look even bigger than
they already are go ahead
tiny ankles and I have such skinny feet
that my feet look gigantic so what I'm
getting at is these are some of the
first booties I've ever tried on in my
life where it actually hugs my ankle and
it just makes my ankle feel so secure
and like I'm like fitting in with the
rest of the world like I don't have
these little toothpick ankles when I
wear these booties so I love them so
much honestly like if these were
designer boots
I would I would pay like anything like
you name the price and I mean honestly
these are like some of the best boots
ever I'm so obsessed they're so
comfortable they fit like a dream I want
to keep them perfect forever okay you

the booties that is it for this video I
really hope that you enjoy my favorite
