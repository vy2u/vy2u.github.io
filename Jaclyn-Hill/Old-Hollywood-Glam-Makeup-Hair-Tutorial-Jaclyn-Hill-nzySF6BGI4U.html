hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
an old Hollywood glam makeup and hair
inspired tutorial there's not much to
say about it it's pretty
self-explanatory
you know I am super excited to be doing
this though and has been on my list of
things to do for so long and it's been
so highly requested and it also includes
a cut crease on the eyes which I am so
excited to finally be doing because it's
very strange I do not have a cut crease
tutorial at all here on my channel so
I'm very excited to finally be getting
around to that for those of you who have
been asking to see a cut crease tutorial
this is all matte all neutral it's gonna
look glamorous and beautiful on
everybody it's absolutely timeless so
yeah I hope that you guys enjoy it thank
you so much for watching I love you guys
I'll see you soon bye hey guys so the
first thing I'm going to be doing today
as always is priming my eyes I am using
Mac Pro Longwear concealer in the shade
nw20
this is my favorite way to prime because
it conceals any blood vessels or veins
or redness while priming for eye shadow
at the same time you do whatever you're
comfortable with though when it comes to
priming the eyes then I'm going to go in
with bamboo this is an eyeshadow by mac
cosmetics it is a really really light
shade so very easy to put in that crease
for a transition color I am using a
sigma e30 8 which is an amazing brush
because it's nice and small but yet it's
still a blending brush as you can see
I'm putting this only on that upper
crease area and I'm not going to get any
of it on the lid then I will go back
with an e 40 brush again from sigma and
just blend that back and forth and
windshield-wiper circular motions
we don't wanna get this on the lid but
even though we're gonna have a harsh cut
crease we still want everything above
that cut crease to be very blended then
I'm going to go in with wedge this is
another color by mac cosmetics and this
is more on the cool side using that same
a 38 I'm going to go right over that
bamboo color the reason I wanted to put
wedge in there as well is because it's
going to really neutralize that I area
because I do not want it to be too warm
or too cool but very neutral so the
exact same steps just blending it out
then I'm going to go in with ground
brown this is another brown shade by mac
cosmetics just very dark and this time
I'm going to be using an angled
technically eyeliner or eye brow brush
this one I think is by Anastasia Beverly
Hills you can use whatever you want I'm
literally going to carve out that crease
as you can see me doing and then I will
go in with a pencil brush and just
back and forth I would suggest putting a
little bit of wedge on that pencil brush
when you're blending it out and not
going in with a clean brush because that
might just kind of chop it up a little
bit sorry I'm a little blurry but it's
the exact same thing we're just going to
lightly carve out that crease and if you
don't have a crease or if you don't have
like a really indented line in your
crease area just go ahead and create one
for yourself you don't have to have a
crease in order to do this and then I'll
just go back and continue blending back
and forth back and forth you can bring
this cut crease as far into the inner
corner as you want I didn't bring it all
the way in but I brought it pretty close
then I'm going to go in with Mac Blanc
type this is a very pigmented very matte
creamy white ivory eyeshadow as you can
see using a flat brush this is a Mac 242
brush I'm all about Mac life today
apparently I'm going to pack this all
over that entire lid using a really
pigmented eyeshadow like this will also
help make that cut crease even more
defined because you can take this shadow
up and really put it in that entire
crease area and make it look even more
harsh which is the first time I think
I'm ever using the word harsh when it
comes to my eye shadow but we do want
that crease to be harsh and we want
everything above it to be very blended
and very blown out as you can see now
I'm going to be doing my eyeliner and
i'm using morphe gel liner in black i
just prefer gel liner over liquid I feel
like I have so much more control over it
and I love this morphe eyeliner it's
very pigmented and very black you don't
have to go over five hundred times to
get it to actually be as black as you
want
I am using a Sigma e65 brush this might
technically be a brow brush but don't
tell anybody I use it for eyeliner I
absolutely love this brush it's my
favorite brush to apply eyeliner with
and what I do is I make a line from the
outer corner of my eye up towards the
tail of my brow and then I just connect
basically the line from the outer tail
of my brow to the inner corner of my eye
and then I just fill it in like connect
the dots I've been doing my eyeliner
like this for about a year and it's my
favorite way it doesn't fail it works
every time I'm going to be giving my
lashes a quick coat of mascara i'm using
mac gigablack lash and then i'm going to
be going in with lashes i am using
velour lash in the style strike a pose I
do have a discount code for you guys
that I'll put in my description box down
below if you're interested strike a pose
are one of my favorite lashes ever for
just like an evening where you want to
look elegant and glamorous because
they're nice and dense and full and
fluffy but they're not too long and too
intense they look like you have lashes
on but in the best way possible they're
just very girly and very feminine then
I'm going to be priming my face with
Tarte clean slate flawless this is a 12
hour brightening primer
I don't usually prime my face but today
I was trying to get as much moisture in
my skin as possible because my skin has
been extra dry this past week and so I
am using that for that purpose then I'm
going to be going in with Giorgio Armani
a luminous silk foundation I wanted to
use the Smashbox on studio skin
foundation today for a much more matte
look for that really old Hollywood retro
glamorous look but again my skin was so
dry I just couldn't I am using a morphe
eg-6 brush to apply my foundation it's
nice it's small it's dense and what I
love about this brush is that it doesn't
pack on too much product because it is
so small and so done so it's really
great for foundation I am using a Mac
Pro Longwear concealer yay an oldie but
a goodie and I'm going to be blending
that out with a damp Beauty Blender make
sure you get your Beauty Blender damp
before you use it because that is what
it is made for and it will make your
under-eye concealer really nice and
sheared out so that you don't take too
much on because if you're like me and
you can be a little heavy-handed when it
comes to your concealer a damp Beauty
Blender will really pick up that excess
product and make it so that you do not
have cake face underneath the eyes I'm
going to even out that highlight by
putting a little bit of it on my chin
area and also on the center of my
forehead this will just kind of evenly
distribute that highlight throughout the
face so that you do not just have this
under-eye highlight and then nothing
else it just evens it out then I'm just
going to set that under-eye area with a
Nastasia banana powder this is from her
contour kits you can also buy this
individually now on her website and I'm
going to set that entire under-eye area
from inner corner to outer corner this
is a must for me otherwise I will become
a crazy mess no matter what concealer I
use then I'm going to use a makeup
forever concealer just to cover up a
couple blemishes I have because I use a
detox mask last week and my skin was not
too fond of it so that is why I'm
incredibly dry and woke up with painful
breakouts the next day so I have some
friends on my face right now and we're
going to hide them moving on now I'm
going to
filling in my brows and I'm not going to
elaborate on it too in-depth we're going
to scan over it pretty quickly because
so many of you have asked for an updated
our teen so I will be filming and
sharing that with you guys very soon I
am using an Anastasia brow Wiz though to
fill in my brows which is my absolute
Rotter dye when it comes to brows it's
my brow lover and my husband is giving
me a nice cold izzy oh if you guys don't
know what this is go out and get it it
is the best drink ever we are slightly
addicted then I'm going to be going in
with mylar this is another eyeshadow by
Mac and I'm going to be highlighting
that brow bone mylar is one of my
favorite shades ever by Mac is so
simplistic and it has this glisten in
this gleam to it without having any
glitter or shimmer it is just absolutely
beautiful and it's great for mature
women who are looking for a highlight
without wanting shimmer or glitter then
I'm going to be taking ground Brown
again and putting it on the lower lash
line only in the outer corner of the eye
right where it meets up with that winged
eyeliner I'm putting it really densely
into that lower lash line and then I
will just go in and buff it out back and
forth I want the color to really only be
on the outer corner of the eye and not
all the way in because I don't want this
to look too smoky then I'm going to take
that same mylar shadow and pop it in the
inner corner just for a nice bright eyed
DOE eye effect once we have done that I
am going to just go ahead and put a thin
coat of mascara on my lower lashes I do
have really long lashes on my lower lash
line so I have to be really careful
because I really don't want the lashes
to seal the show but I did have to put
some mascara on them but as little as
possible will do the trick now I'm going
to be using Makeup Forever bronzer in
the shade 20 to contour my face I am
using a makeup geek brush to do this I
think it's technically a blush brush but
you know me I'm a rule breaker so I'm
going to use it to contour I'm just
sculpting out underneath of that
cheekbone taking it back towards the
temple and blending upward you always
want to blend upward when you're
contouring and never downward otherwise
it will defeat the purpose of sculpting
out your cheekbones then I'm going to
just put that all over the temples and
the forehead this again just like
highlighting will bring it all together
and evenly distribute it then I'm going
to be using ambient lighting blush this
is by hourglass and the shade diffused
heat and
want to be blending out on the apples of
the cheeks back towards that contour
it's so beautiful and it really gives
you a glow from within effect which you
guys know I'm all about that life I'm
just blending it out to make sure that
there are no harsh lines and those
cheeks are nice and blended then I'm
going to be going in with NYX lip liner
in the shade hot red I really do like
NYX lip liners I have to say for like a
nice cheap drugstore lip liner I think
that these are really great so I'm going
to be aligning my lips as you naturally
would I'm not really doing anything
crazy or over lining them or anything
like that I'm just going to line them
like I typically would and fill them in
completely and then I'm going to go with
a red lipstick and I couldn't decide
which one I wanted to do but I decided
to use Gerard cosmetics
fire-engine and it's actually the
perfect time to tell you guys that I do
have a limited 35% off discount code for
you
I will put all the description for that
in my description box down below it's
only going to be lasting for about four
days so if you want to try any of the
products from girag cosmetics check that
out in the description box so now that
we are done with this look yes we're
done it's pretty easy peasy right I
think it is we're going to be moving on
to hair oh this hot mess of the hair I'm
going to be clipping in extensions today
because let's get real you guys know
that was not all me in the intro I am
using Bellamy Lillie hair this is 260
grams of hair and 20 inch 20 inches 20
inches long so it's a lot of hair what
I'm going to be doing is clipping in a
total of three weft and I clip and I
curl as I go so I'm going to be taking
the Bellamy 6 in 1 curler I've raved
about this so many times it is the best
curling iron ever and I am going to curl
all of my hair forward instead of like I
would typically curl it away from my
face I'm going to be curling it towards
my face and that's all it takes to get
that old Hollywood glam retro wave look
is just to curl it towards the face I am
using the biggest barrel that the six in
one comes with so they're nice and big
and fluffy
and as you can see I am spraying my hair
with hairspray as I go I'm using the
healthy sexy hair soy hairspray this is
the soil one at all and I will just get
like a light coat of hairspray every few
strands just to kind of give that like a
nice tight hold so that when we are done
with all this it doesn't just fall flat
because my hair naturally wants to be
flat as a board so now that we have
gotten up towards the top of the head
and we are only working on my natural
hair now we have clipped in a total of
three weft which is really all I need
because this hair is just so thick it's
incredible I'm just going to curl my
natural hair like I've curled the rest
of it and I'm going to give myself a
part that's pretty far over to the side
to really give that intense thick bang
to look extra glamorous then I'm just
going to brush through all of my hair
I'm using a tangle teezer any brush will
do though and then I will just fluff it
up and we are completely good to go when
it comes to the hair it is easy peasy
you can do some teasing if you want I
just use a bunch of hairspray and just
fluffed it up then to complete this look
I just wanted to go in with a little bit
of gerard cosmetics gloss in the shade
summer Sun for just a little extra touch
of glam for that glossy lip and once we
are done with that our look is complete
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you so much for watching I love
you and I'll see you soon
bye
nice hello because cuz of all the
witches were getting worse
