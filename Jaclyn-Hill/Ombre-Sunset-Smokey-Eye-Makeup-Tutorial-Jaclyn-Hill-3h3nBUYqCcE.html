a makeup tutorial on this look right
here obviously I'm so unprepared for
this intro because I'm actually getting
ready to leave for dinner I'm actually
leaving for dinner in about 30 minutes
from now and I thought that I would film
this just like set up all my equipment
and record myself getting ready for
tonight because I knew I wanted to do
something super dramatic so I thought
let's record it make it easy so I'm very
unprepared for this intro I had
absolutely no idea why I'm calling this
look all I know is I came across an old
photo of me and John from when I was 18
years old and I'm wearing like this
exact smokey eye except there was a
little little junkie but that's okay I
used to rock these colors like every day
for a year and a half and when I saw
this picture I was like I have not done
those colors and such a long time so I
felt very inspired to redo the look that
I used to wear when I was 18 years old
so I absolutely love this smokey eye we
are working with gold and cranberries
and purples it's such a pretty color
combination and I made it really
dramatic and really edgy as you can tell
I really smoked it out I made it like an
intense cat eye you of course can modify
it for your face to what fits your needs
you do not have to make it as edgy and
angular's I did you can soften it a
little bit and add as much products but
you know me I'm gonna do it all I'm
gonna do it all so yeah I hope that you
guys enjoy this video thank you so much
for watching I love you and I'll see you
soon
hi guys well hello let's transform this
mess shall we okay let's get started
first thing I'm doing is priming my eyes
as always and I still use the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer because it's just my
absolute favorite way to prime my eyes
ever then I'm going to be going in with
the one the only scotch tape any brand
of tape will work but I'm using scotch
just using a tiny bit like an inch inch
and a half of tape and I'm going to put
on the back of my hand I'm going to peel
it off put on my hand again
peel off again this is just going to
take a little bit of the stickiness away
so it's not too harsh on the eye area
what I'm going to do is put this
underneath the eye and a diagonal line
from the corner of my eye up to my brow
I'm really focusing and concentrating
because I want them to be as symmetrical
as possible because it'll make our life
a whole lot easier if they're
symmetrical to begin with I'm going to
go in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie
eye shadow I know I know okay you can
use maximo a silk bamboo you can use
bobby brown toast they
have like a similar vibe to them but
makeup geek Peach Smoothie that is like
my ride-or-die that's my girl so I'm
going to blend that in the entire crease
from inner corner to outer corner and
then I'm going to go in with makeup geek
creme brulee this is another go-to shade
for me that personally works for my skin
tone for a great transition color in my
crease whatever works for you will ever
go to color that you have in your
collection that'll work just fine for
this look so I am using a sigma e40 to
blend this back and forth all the way
from inner corner to outer corner and
then I'm going to go in with a little
bit more of a precise brush i'm using
the morphe m-43 3 for this you could
also use like a sigma e25 if you have
that brush as well and I'm just going
back in with creme brulee and the crease
just to make it a little bit more dark
then I'm going to be going in with an
ardency in shadow and a shade copper I
don't know why this is called copper
because as you can see it is not a
copper color I did wet in my mac 242
brush with a little bit of fix plus
because I want it just to be super
metallic and very vibrant and shiny in
that inner corner this is a beautiful
pure gold like it looks like a bar of
gold which is why I love it so so much
so I'm gonna put that on the whole inner
corner area and then just kind of fade
out in the middle of the lid I'm not
going to cover my entire lid with this
just focusing on the inner corner of the
eye then I'm going to go in with one of
my old-school all-time favorites this is
Mac copper ring eyeshadow I told you
guys before how back in my Mac days
other fellow like employees would call
me copper ring because I would wear this
every single day that it became my
nickname so using that same 242 brush
I'm going to pack that right over top of
that gold in the center of the lid and
then I'm going to go in with one of my
favorite Purple's of all-time and this
is deep damson again this is by Mac this
is a pro color I believe it's still a
pro color I don't know if Mac has
changed it in the last couple of years
but you can get on that Cosmetics calm
just like anything else that is a pro
product so using a pencil brush I am
just going to really focus this on that
outer crease of my eye this is where
that tape really comes in handy because
you can be as messy as you want to be
and that tape is going to keep it nice
and sharp and clean for you which is why
I absolutely love this method so as you
can see I am just packing it all over
that outer corner kind of focusing on
that v-shape and then taking it up into
the crease try to keep this purple as
low as possible in your crease and don't
take it too high initially because as we
start to blend it will begin to go
higher and higher so try to a
keep that purple nice and low that way
the more you blend the higher it goes i
am using the morphe and 4-3-3 brush to
again blend this up and then I'll go
back in with the Sigma e-40 just to make
sure that there are no harsh lines you
know how it is you go from bottom to top
and then you blend blend blend and you
want to use the smaller blending brushes
for the bottom and the bigger for the
top so as you see I'm using a pencil
brush now then I'll go and with the
morphe and 4-3-3 then I'll go in with
the bigger the e-40 picking up a little
bit of cocoa bear by makeup geek now
which is another one of my absolute
favorite shadows I'm going to put just a
little bit of that in the crease area
because I felt like that purple wasn't
blending as seamlessly as I wanted it to
so sometimes picking up another shade
will just really help with the blending
process making it look super smooth
which is why I use that now I'm going to
go back and with a little bit more
copper ring because in that blending
process I felt like I kind of lost the
pop of that copper shade and I really
want to have a nice gradient transition
from gold to copper to purple so I'm
going to touch that up in the center of
the lid now I'm going to go ahead and
remove the scotch tape and you can see
the big reveal of what we have on that
outer corner now due to the scotch tape
I'm going to use a face wipe any sort of
makeup remover will do and I'm just
going to clean up this under-eye area
because you'll see like everything kind
of disappear we had tons and tons of
fallout that you don't always notice but
when you have that scotch tape you can
really see all that fallout on the cheek
so I'm just going to remove all of the
fault that we have then I'm going to go
in with a q-tip because sometimes using
scotch tape that line can be SuperDuper
harsh so using a clean cotton q-tip I
will just go in and kind of rub back and
forth and this will soften that line so
that it's not like whoa that's intense
you know I'm saying it'll make it just a
little bit softer on the outer edges now
I'm going to be doing my eyeliner I'm
using Maybelline as always this is like
my favorite eyeliner ever it is from the
drugstore The Price is Right and I swear
like there is no eyeliner that I've ever
used that is a gel liner they're like
better on this one so I am very thankful
for Maybelline making this liner and as
you can see because we use that scotch
tape to make that really precise harsh
line on the edge it really acts as a
great guide for your winged liner which
is just awesome because it makes it that
much easier now I'm going to coat my
lashes and any mascara will do for this
because I'm going to be going in with
false lashes anyway
I'm going to be using Lily lashes in the
style Mykonos these are my new favorite
lashes this is the fourth time I have
worn this style and I'm just so in love
with them they are very dramatic if you
haven't heard of Lily lashes yet they
are awesome I just tried them for the
first time this past month and I'll link
them down below for you guys who want to
go ahead and check them out for yourself
now I'm going to be priming my skin
using makeup forever radiance primer and
the reason I'm using the radiance primer
today is because I'm going to be going
in with the LC cosmetics micro silk
foundation and as I have talked about
this foundation before it is a little
bit more on the drier matte side so I
like to use the radiance primer and then
I'm also going to spritz my brush with
some mac fix+ this is the M 439
foundation brush that I've been raving
about I swear this brush and this
foundation are a match made in heaven
and I am currently between the shade
natural and sand depending if I've
self-tanner or not I know a few people
have asked about my shade and the elsi
foundation and if you guys all wanted to
try it I do have a limited coupon code
it's not going to last too much longer
and I will put that down below for you
guys again thank you so much to Lillet
for giving this code because I was very
generous of her so now I'm going to be
filling in the eyebrows I'm using the
Anastasia brow Wiz in the shade taupe
and I have actually really changed the
way I do my brows I make them much
thinner now and I'm just very happy with
them they're not overboard like I feel
like they used to be so yay for finally
feeling like my brows are getting to a
happy place I'm going to be concealing
my under eye area using my absolute
obsession at the moment which is this
Urban Decay Naked concealer I know I say
in every video but I swear this like my
favorite concealer of all time I feel
like this concealer would work the best
for all different skin types if you have
fine lines if you have wrinkles if
you're dry under area whatever it may be
it is just an amazing amazing concealer
that will work for so many different
people so I am using this in a shade
lighter than my skin tone so because of
that I will also put a little bit of it
on the chin in between the eyebrows and
a little dab of it on the center of the
forehead as well just to balance out
that highlight in other areas of my face
because I don't we just want the under
eyes to be a highlight I really want to
kind of balance this out so that it
looks more natural I know natural really
full face of makeup but still it will
actually balance out and make everything
come together much more beautifully in
the end and then I was going to set my
under eye area with powder so I don't
have any
creasing and I am using the Anastacio
banana powder that comes in her contour
kit and it's also sold separately on her
website and I mixed that with the Mac
Pro emphasize which is like a stark
white powder I mix those two together
from my personal perfect highlight shade
and I will just go ahead and set the
under-eye now I'm going to go in with
who faced bronzer okay if you watch my
husband tag then you know I have sang
foo face but I'm going to be going in
with the Too Faced bronzer this is the
chocolate sole that I want I am using an
oldie but a goodie and this is the NARS
eita brush you guys know that this has
been like a ride-or-die brush for me and
then I wasn't using it for quite a while
and I am back on the eater brush big
time I love it so much for contouring I
still stand behind this brush so much I
just think it is amazing it's just
foolproof for contouring I swear it just
makes it so simple so I'm also going to
be bronzing the forehead just to even
that out because any time I contour I
always have to go around the temples and
the hairline just to make everything
come together and I am using the morphe
4 brush I use this for bronzing I use it
for contouring I use it for blush I've
told you guys this brush is just like my
favorite thing right now it's just got
the smoothest bristles it's just so easy
to work with now I'm going to line my
waterline this is like the creepiest
shot ever right I was like ooh so we're
just gonna we're gonna go ahead and cut
that I use the ardency in black eyeliner
to line my inner waterline and then
using a precision brush this is the
Sigma II 15 flat definer I'm going to
take a little bit more of that purple
that deep damson and I'm going to just
rub that all over the lower lash line
all the way from inner corner to outer
corner and then taking a pencil brush
this is the morphe e 18 with a little
bit of that copper ring shade on it I'm
going to lightly dust over it so we have
that purple and that copper smoked out
underneath the lower lash line
and then I'm going to coat my lashes
with mascara you can see that doing that
to the lower lash line really pulls this
look together and just makes everything
look super smoky and it makes your eyes
pop I'm going to be using Mac Melba for
my blush which is one of my all-time
favorites it's a matte blush and it's
beautiful on a very wide range of skin
tones I used to sell this blush more
than any other shade when I worked at
Mac because it just looks gorgeous on
everybody it's so easy to wear and now
of course we are going to be
highlighting and I'm going to be using a
champagne pop the highlighter that I
created with Becca cosmetics because I
can get in
for the shade right now let's get real
I'm going to be using the morphe M 501
brush to apply this on the high points
up my cheekbones this is my favorite
highlighter brush until something better
comes along this has been this has been
my ride-or-die for my highlights and i'm
also going to be taking a champagne pop
and putting it right on the top of that
brow bone just to kind of tie that whole
look together I love highlight my brow
bone especially when I'm doing a super
smoky look I just think that it polishes
it off I'm going to go in with house of
dolls lipstick in the shade this is a
very nude pale peachy pink as you can
see extremely nude so I added a
mineralized glass from Mac over top of
it man a lot a lot of Mac products today
I don't even mean to do that I am using
the shade be nice which is a beautiful
coral shade one of my favorite glosses
especially by Mac and then to finish
this off I'm going to use some fix+
and we are done call it a day I hope you
guys enjoy this look thank you so much
for watching you know I love you and
I'll see you soon bye guys
