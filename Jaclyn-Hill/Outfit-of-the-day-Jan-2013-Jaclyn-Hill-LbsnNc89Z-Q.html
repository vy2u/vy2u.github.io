the day I posted this picture of myself
on Instagram wearing this outfit and I
had so many questions and comments
asking where my pieces were from so I
thought I would film it for you so I
hope you enjoy
my leopard print leggings are from
forever 21 I got mine about a year and a
half ago but these printed leggings are
so and right now they're basically
everywhere
you
my shoes are by the designer boutique 9
and they are now 50% off
you
this key necklace was a gift from my
husband for Christmas I know he
purchased it at Nordstrom but I am not
sure of who would buy
the slouchy clutch is by the brand Lulu
I got this at Nordstrom as well in the
BP department which is the junior
section
so for my arm candy my four bracelets
that I'm playing with right now to which
or a gift I have my initials there
they're by the designer Alex and Annie
and the love bracelet is by BCBG the
earrings that I'm wearing our House of
Harlow which is Nicole Richie's
collection
this blazer that I am absolutely
obsessed with because of the peplum in
the back is by the brand Gibson and I
got this in the TV Department
and my hi-low chiffon top underneath of
my blazer is by the brand lush also in
the juniors department at Nordstrom
you
I always think this is a little penis
thanks to my little cameraman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
