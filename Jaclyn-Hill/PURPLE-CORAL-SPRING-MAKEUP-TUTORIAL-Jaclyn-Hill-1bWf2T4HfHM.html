a pimple and me me me me me well well
well this is a shitshow let's get real
hey guys so today I thought that I would
film this colorful eye makeup tutorial
for you since we're coming into spring I
figured it was the perfect time to do
something really fun and girly and I
used some purples and pinks and corals
and glitter and I just think it's really
fun and a lot of you guys have been
asking for more colorful tutorials of
course and you know purples and corals
because those are definitely colors for
the springtime so yeah this is the look
that I came up with I use a lot of
complementary colors to one another so
maybe you can get a good idea of how you
can wear like purples and corals and
Pink's together and where to put things
on your face and things like that so I
really hope you enjoy this spring
tutorial and I will see you next time
bye
so the first thing I'm doing is taking
this color coral this is a MacPro shade
it's literally called coral you can
order online or get it in any Mac Pro
store don't forget that a Mac Pro store
is different than just a regular Mac
store it's literally called Mac Pro so
you can also access all these colors and
these different products that Mac Pro
has on there on my website I'll put the
link below I have my I primed already
with Mac's painterly Paint Pot and I'm
just taking a sigma brush this is just
like the Mac 224 I believe it's the e-40
and I am just putting this all over in
the crease I'm making the most color
pigmentation on the outer corner of the
eye but then as you see I am just
fluffing around like a crazy person just
to blend it out then I'm going to take
the shade Gurley this is a really really
pretty pink for some reason it looks
kind of yellowy in the camera but it's
it's a pretty true pink and as you can
see in the picture right here
it has a nice sheen but it's not super
super glittery you can use a more
glittery pink which I'm going to go over
that with glitter anyways but this is
just a really nice light wash of pink so
if you're a pink kind of girl this is a
great color just to have to throw on all
over the lid with a fluffy brush and
then I'm going to take the color hepcats
I'll show you a little bit closer there
we go and this is a Mac color as well
and it's like a really gorgeous pinkish
purple it's not super purple but it's
not super pink
it's like perfect right in between but
it's got great pigmentation I don't
typically put color II shadows in the
outer crease I mean I'm sorry I meant
shimmery eyeshadows and outer crease but
I wanted to in this because honestly
when it comes to color it's not always
easy to blend matte shades in that
crease when they're like a bright color
so I thought I'd make it easier for you
guys because this is definitely this is
definitely easier and I'm going back
with um the color coral once again on
that 217 brush this is the Sigma brush
but it's just like the Mac 217 and I'm
just gonna buff that all around just to
buff it out even more and then I'm going
to take Mac's sketch this is definitely
a staple by Mac if you don't have sketch
it's definitely something you need this
is a beautiful color if you just put it
on the in the outer corner of the crease
with like a light
champagne color on the lid it is a
gorgeous gorgeous deep purple I love
this color so I'm just taking that with
a stiffer brush and I'm putting it
densely in the outer corner and then as
you can see I'm bringing up lightly with
no additional product on my brush into
that crease to blend it into that hepcat
and coral shade and then I just kind of
sweep it over the lid because you don't
want any harsh lines you don't want it
to be too far out and that outer crease
but you don't come too far in so once
you're done shaping it in that area you
just want to take your brush and just
kind of run it in circular motions like
you see me doing right here just to make
sure that it's all blended together and
there's no harsh jaggedy edges and then
I'm going to take enlightening this is a
pressed pigment by Mac you can still get
these online I believe and it's
literally just glitter and depending how
you apply it it can be really really
shiny or it can be super super glittery
so I'm going to take a synthetic brush a
really thin one this is the 242 by Mac I
talk about all the time
I think this brush is the best brush for
packing on anything and I am just going
to pack and then after I like pack it on
I really move it around keep the brush
on the eye and just rub it around
um I pull my eye taught when I do this
so that I don't get it like it's hard to
explain but I pull my eye so that it all
goes on a lot smoother if I don't tug at
my eye a little bit then it'll just
basically fall over my face so that's
why I do that and then I'm going to use
number 15 lashes by red cherry changing
it up I'm using the duo waterproof glue
I know I got a huge glob on that but you
still want to apply it really thinly and
then I just use my tweezers to pop it on
if you guys want to see a lash video I
know if you you've requested I could try
to do that soon and then I'm going to
use the Laura Mercier silk cream
foundation absolutely love this
foundation it looks really really yellow
on me in this video and I know I hear
that from you guys sometimes that's okay
though I was really really pale when I
filmed this like really pale because I
was still getting over being sick so I
know it looks really weird but once I
have everything else on with the under
eye concealer which is the Mac Pro
Longwear concealer as always and I have
all that blended out and the blush and
everything you'll see it'll look much
much better not as yellow and then I'm
going to take Mac Pro sculpting powder
this is actually the high
lighting powder and accentuate and I'm
going to take that on a highlighter
brush by Sigma and just lightly dust
that under the eye area this is great
for the under eye area you don't want to
use all powders under there but this
one.you is made for that area so just to
set that and then I'll take that same
powder since it has a pink tone in it
and I'll just dust it over the t-zone
area just so that I kind of neutralize
that yellow that's going on in my
foundation and how it's not matching and
then I'm taking Mac's mineralize
skinfinish and the shade medium dusting
it all over the face once again this is
a brush from Sigma it's also made at Mac
I talked about at my brush video just
cuz I don't what - to be really shiny
all day even though I'm dry this
foundation can look shiny and I don't
like the t-zone to look shiny and then
I'm taking cork and a 212 brush and I'm
filling in the brows and I will show you
something a little bit different today
when I do color like this I like to make
my brows really defined and a little bit
more sharp if that makes sense to just
make it look natural so I take concealer
and I go around the edges especially at
the bottom and just carve it out like
I'm doing and I very lightly just buff
it out so that that eyebrow has more
shape because I want the eyes in the
shadow to stick out more than anything
and then I go on and I highlight the
under brow area in the inner corner area
because now you can see the brows are a
little bit more define a little bit
sharper it's kind of like the same thing
that you do with drag makeup and it just
brings more attention to the eye area so
then I'm going to take a 212 brush again
one of my favorites and put hepcat on
that lower lash line and just rub it all
around and then once you have hepcat
down there you want to get a bigger flop
of your pencil brush and just buff that
out and just don't forget when you're
working with your under eye area it
takes time and then more time and the
more time you really can't get impatient
with this if you want this to look
smooth you have to send the time to
really buff this out back and forth in
and out and windshield wiper motions
because it's not a super easy thing to
do it's easy to get that jaggedy
under-eye look and then you kind of have
raccoon eyes and then I'm going to take
girly again because it has the sheen but
it's not really super shimmery and I'm
going to go over it
with the girly look now if you have
really bad like pink circles under your
eyes you're not going to want to use a
pink shade to blend that out because
it'll just emphasize and then I'm going
to take max sketch and just dab a tiny
bit right at that waterline just to make
it pop a little bit more then after that
I'm going to apply mascara this is the
Maybelline Oh
I can't thank fiber extensions lash
mascara I will look it up and I will put
it in the bottom bar below with all of
the other products and information that
I have in this video and I'm showing you
your options so many so you want to use
a coral blush now that we have pink and
purple eyes you want to use something
that has an orange e coral e shade to
make that coral pop in the eyes if you
do a pink blush or a lavender blush your
gonna look like the 80s so to balance
that out you want to pick up and really
play up that coral shade so I believe I
am using style Mac blush and style on my
cheeks right now there's a beautiful one
by Tarte and I want to go get it so bad
okay I'm getting off subject hello I'm
taking a tiny bit of bronzer and just as
you can see barely dusting it just a
tiny tiny bit because we want to
concentrate on the coral this is not all
about bronzing this is about color today
mary lou manizer highlighter by the balm
love it's going to tap that on the top
of my cheeks thank you so much you guys
for giving me so many amazing
recommendations for color highlighters
for the cheekbones in the last tutorial
love that this is the chroma lip color I
don't know the shaded this is but I am
obsessed with these things like I didn't
think I was in like the Kardashian
makeup collection but I love love this
color but if I left it like that it'd be
too much pink so I'm going to go over it
with the Revlon just bitten kissable lip
stain and put that on top and this is in
creamsicle so that orange color with the
pink color mixed together is going to
really even out so it's not too pink or
too orange so the eyes are pink and
coral the cheeks are strictly coral and
the lips are pink and coral after that
you're done thank you so much for
watching love you guys na bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
