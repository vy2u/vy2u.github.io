really fun and colorful makeup look I do
get a lot of requests for something
outside the box and vibrant so I figured
why not throw this into the mix I do
typically work with more neutral colors
that you guys can use on a day-to-day
basis but this is very nighttime and
party appropriate so I know it's
different
I hope you guys enjoy it it's very
sparkly and very blue I know blue is an
eyeshadow that we all try to stay away
from because it kind of reminds to the
80s and scares us but this is a very
easy way to make it look glamorous and
not look scary so I really hope you
enjoy as always details and questions
you may have will all be listed down in
the description bar below so don't
forget to check that out and thank you
so much for watching and I love you guys
and I'll see you soon
first thing I'm going to do is take Mac
satellite dreams eyes shadow and I'm
going to mix it with a little bit of
makeup geek wisteria eye shadow as well
it is not necessary to use two different
eye shadows but I thought I'd be totally
honest with you on the products that I
am using whichever shade of purple you
do choose it is important to have a
little bit of shimmer in it even though
we typically put matte colors in our
crease with this look in particular it's
going to help a lot with the blending
out process I'm going to just take a
fluffy brush and blend this back and
forth from inner to outer corner working
upward to help the blending out process
once again and then I'm going to go in
with makeup geek mystic gel liner gel
liners can be used for many different
things and today we're going to use it
as a base for our eyeshadow so using a
pencil brush I'm going to just pack this
all over my lid and blend it upward I
want to make sure that this is
completely saturated from inner to outer
corner and then once you get to the
crease you want to make sure that it is
touching that purple color you don't
want to surpass the purple color but you
do want them to connect that way there
is no choppiness using this color as a
base is going to just make our next eyes
shadow way more vibrant and not have any
fallout on our cheekbones then I'm going
to go in with Too Faced a few of my
favorite things palette this is a newer
holiday palette I absolutely love it
we're going to use shade partytime which
is what this entire look was based
around I'm going to use an E 55 shadow
brush by Sigma and I'm just going to
pack this on all over the lid I did
originally try using a 252 brush by Mac
and it was just too thin and I
I shadow falling all over my face so
we're going to pack pack pack this on
just using stippling motions all over
the lid and then once we get to the
crease we're going to swipe it back and
forth like you can see me doing now just
to help blend it into that purple a
little bit more don't worry about
blending because that's what we're going
to do now I'm using the e39 brush with a
little bit more of wisteria from makeup
geek I did do a blog post about the new
brushes I will link that down below but
this 8:39 is my absolute favorite I
absolutely love it I don't know how I
live without it before you can see how
easy it is it blends everything out I
love how short and dense and precise it
is it's not messy you don't get sloppy
it's just it's foolproof it is so so
easy to work with you can see that
purple now turn into the smoky or deeper
purple now I'm going to go in with
makeup geek gel liner and immortal I did
not record this because my camera died I
am very sorry about that so I just put
on a finish line of gel liner with no
wing I don't want there to be a really
dramatic liner and I'm hopping on velour
lashes and all me up
dhaumya strike a pose strike a pose
sorry I am using Mac shroom eyeshadow to
highlight under my brow bone again with
an E 55 this is going to pull the
eyeshadow look completely together
together and give you that really
glamorous blown-out look using a clean
blending brush I'm just going to blend
all that cut that color together that
purple with that shroom shade just to
make it look really flawless then I'm
going to go in with NYX glitter liner
and crystal Jade such a beautiful color
I love NYX glitter liners it's a great
way to get super glittery shiny
eyeshadow without worrying about glitter
falling all over your face and eyeliner
throughout the night so the reason I did
this after I did my eyeliner it's very
difficult to put eyeliner on overtop of
glitter sometimes it can be super choppy
so I'm just doing this secondly starting
in the inner corner and then blending it
outward the more I get to the center of
my eye the more light-handed I am going
to be applying this I wanted to be the
thickest in the inner corner and then
kind of let the glitter fade out then
I'm going to go in with Make Up For Ever
HD foundation I am using shade one two
three using a sigma f80 kabuki brush you
guys know how I feel about this I don't
even need to talk about how much I love
this brush right now as you can tell it
is a lot darker than my face and if you
can tell my face is super super
snow-white pale and my body has a little
more color I did use a self-tanner a
couple of days ago because I was looking
a little too Elmer's glue it was not
cute so then I'm going to go in with mac
prolongwear concealer and nw20 and blend
this out with a sigma brush I think this
is an F 82 but as always I will have all
of the brushes and detail listed in my
description bar below with links where
you can find them so I'm just buffing
out that concealer and then I'm going to
go in and set it with Mac Pro
highlighting powder and emphasize I use
this all the time I just kind of go
around the eye area just to make sure
that it's all set make sure you are
pressing directly underneath the eyes to
make sure that none of that liquid
creases or settles then I go around the
corners just to make sure the eyeshadow
has not kind of fallen all over the
place then I'm going to fill in my brows
quickly using a Nastasia brow is and
soft brown like I said before I will be
doing an in-depth tutorial on this very
soon so look out it's coming up then I'm
going to go in with hoola bronzer by
benefit I have totally hit pan on this
I'm getting super low I never knew that
I would love this so much if you want to
see an in-depth contour video I have one
and I will link that below for you I'm
making this super quick and I'm just
going to buff this all around the
forehead and underneath the cheekbones
then I'm going to go in with margin by
Mac this is a really beautiful neutral
shade it's got a gorgeous shimmer in it
it's pretty much pretty on all skin
tones when I worked there it there was
never really a person that it didn't
work with it's a beautiful shade so
blending that from the apples of the
cheeks up towards the cheekbones then
I'm going to use Stila all-over shimmer
duo and kitten and I should not be
highlighting because I do have a blemish
and this is just going to make it stand
out but I am anyways because this will
really really tie the look together with
the highlighted brow bone and the
highlighted cheeks so then I'm going to
use bare minerals original foundation
and shade light I believe and just pack
this in between my eyebrows on my nose
just so that nothing moves then I'm
using Anastasia brow is not brow is I'm
sorry and a thick clear brow gel to set
my brows just to make everything look a
little bit more natural and not move
this is the most amazing brow gel of all
time it's going to look wet for a little
while but it'll get better I promise I'm
using shroom as an inner corner
highlight with a big fluffy brush and
then I'm going
to use a little bit more of wisteria or
satellite dreams whatever you want just
buffing it under my eye and then I'm
going to go in with a gel liner the same
one by makeup geek and I'm just going to
put this all over the inner rim just
take my eyes stand out a little bit more
make this a little bit more smoky the
reason I did the wisteria underneath my
eyes first is because it will help blend
this out as the process goes along if I
were to go in and do it now it would not
look the same so I always do it first
and then I do my waterline now I'm going
to put a tiny bit underneath the eye in
the outer corner just in the outer
corner then using a blending brush I
know I was awful at filming this part
and look at my wet eyebrows I dry wait a
minute and I'm just buffing that out and
then I'm going to use a L'Oreal
voluminous mascara and just coat the
bottom lashes with one coat of mascara
and then you have that after that I'm
going to go in and clean up anything
that happened a lot of times I get
little flecks of mascara on me or
whatever you want to use a q-tip to
finish blending out your under eye you
can I'm going to use this urban decay
lipstick and native I believe I'll have
it listed below as always it's very
similar to Mac creme Cup but I couldn't
find creme Cup so just a pinky color
then I'm going to go over again with
Japanese maple by Mac I wanted it to be
a pink nude not too pink or too nude so
I put these two together after that you
are all done so I really hope you enjoy
this and I'll see you soon bye guys
I got comment some people saying that
when I cross my eyes it ruins my beauty
taking oh I totally have a secret alla
tears I throw about I can't talk and
this voice I smell from being the crazy
realm YouTube to the creepy one
plenary is a holiday party which is
really creepy at the holidays are coming
