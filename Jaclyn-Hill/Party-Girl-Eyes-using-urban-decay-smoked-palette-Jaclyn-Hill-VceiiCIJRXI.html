this video filmed in time because the
Sun is just now going down so I'm like
seconds away from losing daylight so I'm
so proud of myself
yay Gomi today I'm going to be using
colors out of the smoked palette by
urban decay you cannot even begin to
understand my obsession my husband thing
is it's hilarious I just six sit around
like it but like seriously I I love my
makeup just like a quick little review
on this palette it's gorgeous but it's
not like a palette that's going to meet
all of your needs it's not something
that you can like forgetting to breathe
because I'm talking so it oh okay it's
not a palette that you can like throw in
your bag and take on like a vacation
with you and it's going to be like you
know the palette that you can use the
whole time like the naked palettes would
be it is a gorgeous palette and
seriously the eyeshadows in this palette
are the most pigmented beautiful vibrant
eyeshadows I have ever laid my hands on
in my life they are like butter it's
ridiculous I feel like I'm never going
to run out of these even though I'm sure
I will because I'm addicted umm but yeah
like there's definitely a couple of
things in this palette that are missing
like it doesn't have a nice matte brown
to work with in your crease and it
doesn't have a shimmery highlight color
so even though it is actually amazing
and I'm obsessed with it it's not a
palette that's like practical for
everyday use not something that you can
take with you and it's going to work for
everything you still are going to need a
couple of shadows from other palettes
like I tried putting something together
that was just from this palette and you
definitely can
but it's not really my style you know um
these colors right here they're really
nice but they're only really gonna work
on people who are very fair because even
on me having a slight tan right now they
kind of looked chalky on me because
they're too white and they're too matte
um so yeah that's just like my quick
little input on this palette but still
none of those things are stopping me
from absolutely adoring it so I used two
colors from this palette and then I use
the rest Mac shadows um so I hope you
guys don't mind and I hope the two
blankets and sorry they're talking so
much but also one more thing because I
have gotten so many questions and I want
to just like put an end to it because I
feel bad that you guys are confused but
this Ben Nye banana powder I've gotten
so many questions from you guys on what
it is and how to buy it and I just want
to let you know really quickly that I
believe that this is online only
um maybe overseas they sell Ben Nye in
stores but I don't know here in the u.s.
I've never seen Ben Nye before and all
it is it's a highlighting powder for the
under eye area it's making it big right
now you're hearing a lot about it on
YouTube recently because of Mario Kim
Kardashian's makeup artists he says he
uses this on every single client and
because of the yellow tone it's really
beautiful to highlight with he says that
he uses it even on the darkest of
clients so um it's cheap it's like eight
dollars I got mine personally at
camera-ready Cosmetics calm and I can
put the link below for you guys so I
hope that answers your questions keep
the comments coming let me know what you
want to see I love you all so much and
have a great night
okay so as always we are starting off
with a blending color I chose Samoas
silk normally I go with soft Brown and
I'm going to add that in my crease just
for fun in a minute as well but Samoas
silk is much more yellowy and I just
think that it gives such a beautiful
glow to any color that you put on your
lid it just really helps you glow okay
so now I'm using soft Brown and I'm
gonna take that and I'm gonna put it
over top this is totally and completely
optional I was just having fun with my
makeup and I wanted to darken up the
crease it's unnecessary to use both
colors but you know just stay with me
here okay now I'm going to take saddle
as you can see it's a very popular color
in my household because it has hit pan
I'm gonna take it on a 217 and I'm gonna
put it right in my crease and as always
i show you how i start with my brush off
sideways and then i go down and then i'm
gradually gonna start turning it the
opposite way to help build it up in
color and once i have a good amount of
pigment on there i'm gonna go back with
just the same brush as before with that
leftover soft brown and SMO silk on it
and just buff it out messily as you can
see there's no rhyme or reason to it at
all and then just going and doing the
same step on the other eye now with this
shade I'm actually not putting it deep
down in my crease like I normally do I'm
gonna have it actually farther upward as
you can see mainly on the outer corner
and the reason I'm doing that is because
now I'm gonna go in with a shade called
mushroom and it's this beautiful creamy
warm silvery color oh it's just so
gorgeous okay I'm gonna take it on any
flat shader brush I'm gonna press it all
over my lid now I kept that saddle color
higher up in my crease because here I
don't want this saddle color to be on
the deep outer corner of my eye if you
are catching my drift so what I'm doing
is I'm making a tabletop shape with this
where in my inner corner going up higher
as you can see I'm going to trace out my
whole crease in there and put it all
over my lid and all the way out in that
outer corner area I hope that you're
understanding what I'm saying I think
you can though so just all over the lid
all the way under the outer core
and you want that brown to be up in your
higher crease not in your lower crease I
totally I know you know what I'm trying
to say here you get it okay so yeah I'm
just pushing it around I swipe and then
I push and then I swipe and then I push
and it helps it all blend together
better and I'm just taking a clean brush
here and I'm just gonna feather out any
harsh lines that we have going on back
and forth back and forth it's very
repetitive but just continue doing these
steps and you might not feel like you're
doing much but trust me you are you're
gonna help take that harsh gray line and
blend it into your skin so that it's not
choppy which is definitely something
that we want now I'm putting a little
bit more soft brown on that brush or
some Oh a silk whichever one any
mid-tone brown shade and I'm just
tossing it back and forth in that crease
to just help blend it all out even more
I'm going back and touching up with
saddle just because putting that
mushroom all over my lid is going to
wash out that shade so as you can see
I'm keeping this shot of the saddle up
in my higher crease again now I'm just
going to show you really quick just me
throwing on my eyeliner just because I
want you to see that I am doing a winged
eyeliner today not super dramatic but
kind of now I'm gonna take back door um
just a little thing like I think it's a
little weird that back doors the name of
a dark brown just think about it if you
find yourself a little grossed out then
you and I are on the same page anyways
I'm taking this on a stiff brush and I'm
just putting it sharply and for the
first time ever I want this line to be
harsh but I'm gonna put this in my
crease don't worry about messing up your
eyeliner and then going in with that
gray brush and I'm touching up that
mushroom because I want this backdoor
shade to be pretty precise in my outer
corner I want it to be kind of a cut
crease but not technically so it's going
to be the mushroom and then this line
and then fading into the saddle now I'm
taking a loose glitter and I'm going to
spray it with fix+ while it's on my
brush this is the same brush I use to
apply mushroom and I'm going to just
push all over my lid you can do a thin
layer of it you can do multiple layers
of it whatever you want it doesn't
matter
um the glitter I'm using is from Mac and
is from the Wonder Woman collection it's
the reflex pearl I believe you can get
glitter anywhere like this cosmetic
Gregg lair is sold at Sally's Beauty
Supply for really cheap I mean when it
comes to glitter I do not see the
difference in Mac glitter or drugstore
glitter it's just glitter so after that
I am just spritzing my face with fix+
and that's going to help set the glitter
so that it doesn't move okay
now I'm going to put on banana powder I
just did my foundation and my eyebrows
and I applied false lashes and I didn't
show you guys because I feel like it's
very repetitive if you guys want me to
show that step those steps in every
video let me know but I just feel like
it's unnecessary okay I'm using matte
bronze and this is again by Mac and I am
using it on a sigma kabuki brush this is
my new obsession
it applies powder bronzer so beautifully
I'm obsessed
it looks so airbrushed I never want to
use a different brush again so yes I
highly highly recommend doing this I
want to buy all of them now and just
retire every other brush I have no I'm
just kidding but seriously okay very
important step if your forehead is big
or small I think it's necessary I'll be
making a highlighting contour video soon
so stay tuned to hear more in depth
about that
I am taking cantaloupe blush this is a
Mac Pro shade it is my favorite blush
ever right now and I'm supplying it to
the apples of my cheeks Mac Pro anybody
can buy from there it's not just a pro
store a lot of people ask questions
about that this is albatross highlighter
by NARS and Mac soft and gentle and I'm
going to lightly mix them together look
at that glow and just tab them all over
my cheekbones then I'm going to go in
back with saddle on a pencil brush or
any brush or q-tip it doesn't matter and
just rub it all along my lash line back
and forth you don't have to do this
again I'm showing you all the steps I
don't always wear eyeshadow down there
but I am today so that I'm going to go
back in with back door with any brush
I'm using one that's a little bit
thinner and more precise so it can get
in there nice and easily
and
put it in there and then I'm going to
just move it around so that it's blended
out a lot of you are asking questions
about my mascara wand so here it's a
normal mascara wand and I bend it so
that it is easier to apply mascara and
you don't get that wand hitting you in
the nose or the face and it just makes
it so that you can hold your brush
farther away from your face so that your
mascara doesn't get like goopy and stuff
okay so I'm going in with this little
urban decay lip gloss I don't know what
it's called it came with the Naked 2
palette I love it it has a lip plumper
in it so it's kind of like minty and it
is such a beautiful shade and when I
wear it
I've never gotten so many compliments on
my lip gloss before in my life it is
just so pretty it's just it's radiant so
yeah I'm gonna have to go by the full
size of this because I love it so much
and then you are done that's it that can
be it but I'm going to show you you can
add a dark brown eyeliner this is cosa
reach by Mac or a black one and make
your look even more smoldering a lot of
people are going to like this more and
you can add a new lip and you'll have
much more dramatic eyes and look all
around I hope you enjoy thank you so
much for watching and have a great night
