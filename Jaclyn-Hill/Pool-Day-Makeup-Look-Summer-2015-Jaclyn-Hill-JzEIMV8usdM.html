mmmm
hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
a pool day makeup look for you I have
seen a ton of requests the past couple
of weeks for a pool day makeup look so
that is exactly what we and then I'll do
today I have a wearing this look so much
recently because for me personally this
is like my new no makeup makeup look in
this summer time when you're going to
spend a day outside whether it's a pool
day of each day an afternoon barbecue
you do not want a full face of makeup
because if you're anything like me it's
just so uncomfortable especially in the
humidity of Florida oh it's bad out
there trust me it looks all nice and
pretty right now don't believe it it's a
liar it's deceiving it's so humid it's
so sticky it's swampland so what I'm
going to be spending the afternoon
outside I want something that is going
to be comfortable and practical at the
same time but I also want to look very
bronzed and very glowing because hello
we're outside we want to look like the
Sun is just beaming off of us making us
look like bronzed glowy goddesses
no just me okay so this look is
extremely easy it'll honestly take you
like 3 maybe 4 minutes so I hope that
you guys enjoy this video thank you for
watching and I'll see you soon
hi hey guys I am very excited today
because I'm like look it's pretty doubts
I actually get to go to the pool this is
a good day so I'm going to start off by
using an SPF on my face of course we
need to protect our skin because we're
going to be in the Sun so I'm going to
be using this new Tarte Guard SPF 30
that's made for the face and it smells
really good like a very pleasant scent
which is nice with an SPF so I have not
used this more than once so I don't have
a review on it but so far so good next
step I'm going to be going in with
concealer I'm going to be using the
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer because
this is my favorite at the moment and
I'm going to be pairing it with the
morphe e 20 brush I am going to be only
concealing areas that I feel like really
need it so I'm going to conceal just the
inner corner of the eye and as you can
see I'm not going to do an overwhelming
amount I'm going to do the outer corner
of the eye because I can always tend to
get like red patches there right around
the nose because almost all women get
red right there from hormones and then a
zebra stripe right down the center of
that nose then I'm going to go in and
just begin to blend this out you know
how to blend I don't I don't need to
give instructions right right you've
been here before
we've done this okay so I'm just going
to dab up and down in these specific
areas because I don't want to blend this
concealer all over my face I want to go
ahead and target the
keye redness areas so conceal any area
that is an insecurity or read on your
face but then we want to leave the rest
of the face very fresh and clean because
that's going to look the best and be the
most practical when you're in the Sun so
voila we can move on oh and Frankie just
how to make a quick little debut so hi
Frankie you're getting so big okay we
love you bye now we are going to go in
with bronzer this is the terracotta by
Guerlain this is an SPF 10 which is kind
of fun and I'm going to be using the
morphe for which I have raved about it
is my favorite brush for many reasons so
the way I'm going to be using this is
spraying this bronzer directly onto this
brush and then I'm just going to go
right in with it when you first see that
color on the skin you're going to be
like holy guacamole this is too much
this is orange this is intense blend it
out we know how to blend here on my
channel so we are just going to blend
blend blend move it in circular motions
all around the face as you can see I'm
going up on the cheekbone I'm going down
below the cheekbone I'm going back to
the ear I am NOT going to try to contour
with this product whatsoever I am just
going to bronze so again I'm going to
put it up on the temple and the hairline
of the forehead and I'm going to drag it
all on the forehead by the brows I
basically want to make everything bronze
except the very center of my face so
just think that your going to cover
everything on the outer portion and then
leave the center of your face nice and
clean so just blend this all out down on
the chin area and make sure that you
don't have any line of demarcation
between your face and your neck of
course I'm just going to use some
Anastacio clear brow gel just to make it
super easy for me because I don't feel
like going in with any color on my brows
but if you feel like you really need
some color on your brows I would very
highly suggest the what is it called the
Mac Pro Longwear waterproof brow set
because it's waterproof and it works
great and it gives tons of color if you
are uncomfortable with just using a
clear brow gel I would definitely use
this one right Tia now we are going to
go in and get that highlight on fleek
and as you can tell I am pretty excited
about doing my highlight clearly can you
see the excitement yep okay so I'm going
to be using champagne pop of course this
is the highlight that I created with
Becca cosmetics and I'm going to go in
with the morphe 501 brush this is my
favorite brush for highlighting ever
until someone out does it the morphe M
501 is my favorite is out of stock right
now but it will be back I promise very
soon so I'm going to drag this all along
the very tops of my cheekbones alongside
the side of my
area down on the apples of the cheeks
listen when you're going to be out in
the Sun this is the one time that you
can highlight as much as you want and
you're it's okay to look oily it's okay
to look greasy and dewy and over-the-top
so I'm going to put this on my Cupid's
bow the tip of my nose and yes even the
center of my forehead I'm going to be
strobing today if you will I'm going to
take it to another level and because I'm
going to be at the pool I'm going to
also highlight my shoulders and as you
can see it gives such a difference like
is that not gorgeous please it's like
that shoulder was like way I helped me
and this one is like yes beaming I mean
come on I'm struggling here because I'm
using my right hand to apply this on my
right shoulder and I it's not easy but I
feel like I can't do anything with my
left hand like at all so I just make it
work I'm going to also highlight my
collarbone and then I will also bring
this down and just put a little bit on
the center of my chest as well just to
really give that radiant beaming
highlighted look when you're sitting in
the Sun if you plan on going and diving
into the pool immediately don't do this
because it's a waste of product but if
you're like me and you're just going to
be laying out next to the pool this will
definitely give you a very highlighted
glowy bronzed you look so now I'm going
to just curl my lashes I am NOT using
mascara because for me personally I feel
like even if it's waterproof mascara it
just can get annoying and kind of run on
my eyes and I don't want the hassle so
I'm just going to curl my lashes to get
a lifted appearance and then move on for
my lips I am going to be using a buxom
lipgloss this is a lip polish and the
name Samantha this is my favorite lip
gloss for the pool because it has a very
cooling
minty sensation on your lips and it
feels amazing when you're hot outside I
know that's random but it's true so that
completes our pool day makeup look I
told you it was easy peasy I hope that
you guys enjoy it thank you so much for
watching and may your highlight always
be on fleek bye guys
bye-bye
