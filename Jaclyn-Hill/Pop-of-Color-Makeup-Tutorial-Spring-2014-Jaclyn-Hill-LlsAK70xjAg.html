intro so this is what you get Georgie
first thing I am doing is priming my
eyes using Mac Pro Longwear concealer in
shade nw20
as always you know it's the deal is then
we are going in with a big fluffy brush
and we are using makeup geek peaches and
cream and Peach Smoothie and we are
going to put these both in the outer
corner of our eye and blend them inward
you guys have seen me use these shadows
a million times talk about these shadows
a million times but the great thing
about this look is it starts off with
just an every day neutral eye look and
then we bring in a really fun pop of
color so just going back and forth and
windshield wiper motions all the way
from outer corner to inner corner then
using makeup geeks pigment and afterglow
you guys watch my channel you know this
is one of my favorite pigments of all
time it is so beautiful and with a sigma
e55 I am working that color all the way
from inner corner to outer corner and
then that Brown that we put in the
crease is just going to help it fade up
kind of like an ombre effect so that
there's no harsh lines then we are going
in with eyeliner I'm going to do a
pretty dramatic wing today using
Maybelline gel liner in the shade
blackest black as you see I start from
the outer corner just kind of directing
my lines and then I go in and just fill
in the blanks just to make the liner the
easiest this is my favorite way of
applying it and it never fails for me
then I'm going in with Lancome Hypnose
mascara and just coating my lashes and
preparing for my favourite lashes of
life right now which are wispy
sweet-nothings by velour lashes I am so
in love with these you don't even know
they are so beautiful so natural so
fluffy so wispy I absolutely love them
and for any brides these would be
absolutely gorgeous then I go over that
line again with the black gel liner just
to ensure that there's no gaps or spaces
in that eye liner just so it's perfect
I'm a perfectionist it's a problem at
moments then we're going in with NARS
sheer glow foundation and a drumroll
please the Sigma f80 flat top kabuki
what is new buffing that into my skin I
am just going circular motions
all around the face as you can see this
foundation actually matches me right now
because I do have some color in my skin
so it doesn't look like a crazy
different color normally my face is but
white and my body is tan oh thank
goodness
it matches right now then going in with
Mac Pro Longwear concealer in nw20 I'm
going to Pat this with my finger in a V
from inner corner to outer corner then I
am going in with Sigma F 86 brush and
buffing it out as always love this brush
can't live without it it is the best
concealer brush of all time it's not
technically a concealer brush but get it
use it as a concealer brush you'll thank
me later
then I am going in with Mac prep and
prime highlighter in light boost which
is a yellowy green tone which works with
my skin tone if you are more of a pink
undertone then you're going to want to
use radiant rose which is the same exact
product with just a peachy pink
undertone as to opposed to yellow agreed
I needed to do this extra highlight
because as you can see underneath my
eyes is looking very light from using
that Pro Longwear in nw20
so to balance it out I have to go in
with highlighters and other areas of my
face to make it look much more natural
if you just highlight your under-eye
area it can be way too much then I'm
going to fill in my brows bada-bing done
using Anastasia brow Wiz 'iz I will put
a video to my brows down below I'm going
to set the under-eye concealer and all I
am using is the Anastasia contour
palette in the banana shade and that is
all I'm doing then I'm going in with Mac
mineralized loose powder and I'm going
to set my t-zone area this is my
favorite powder recently to set my
t-zone it's nice and light and has a
little bit of a glow then for the fun
part we are going to go in with Mac I :
minted this is a really gorgeous greeny
blue shade and I'm going to line my
entire waterline generously and then
once I've got that entire thing lined
I'm going to just kind of drag it
underneath I'm being sloppy as you can
see I am NOT making this perfect by any
means because we will blend out the
mouth just has to hang open in order to
do this right it's like no girl can
touch her eye area with your mouth
hanging open I am trying very hard to
keep my mouth closed at this moment and
the struggle is real
I'm just going to get this all over that
water line area and then go and with
Sigma's Midori this is a beautiful green
shade it was in their resort palette but
they no longer sell that so I will list
it down below where you can get the
individual eyeshadow it is the perfect
green it is the only green I really use
on my eye area because it is just
absolutely beautiful and so pigmented
and I am just buffing that back and
forth back and forth back and forth take
your time and it will really blow that
color out then we are going to go in
with a bronzer I'm using Makeup Forever
matte bronzer in number 20 and I'm going
to contour as always with the NARS eita
brush this brush was back in stock at
Nordstrom for a hot second sold out then
came back I'm not really sure of what's
happening with this brush at the moment
if I can find it I will link it down
below for you of course
then I'm going to go in with the oldie
but a goodie and that is NARS orgasm
blush I am using a Mac 129 short handle
blush brush the reason I use this is
because I've used it for five years it's
just one of those brushes that isn't
even that amazing of a brush but because
you've owned it for so long it's just
good and then I'm going to go in with a
Mac mascara on my lower lash line and I
am so sorry I actually don't remember
the name is mascara but I absolutely
love it for my lower lashes and I will
link it down below then I'm going to go
in with the alarm or CA it's called the
matte highlighter and zero one but it's
not matte so whatever it's absolutely
beautiful using a sigma tapered
highlighter brush I am just going to
make the weirdest faces of life and put
this on my cheekbone area one of my
favorite highlighters then I'm going to
go in with Mac coral bliss such a
gorgeous coral shade it's perfect for
summertime especially if you have a
slight tan absolutely beautiful so you
can see this is very complementary or we
can go in with something a little more
awesome which is Mac Pro Longwear lip
pencil which is my favorite lip pencil
of life they don't move and this is in
the shade shock value I believe and then
once we line our entire lips to make
sure that nothing moves throughout the
day I'm going to go in with Lime Crime
count for a counter florescent um
contessa fluorescent I believe I will
link it down
below as well and that is just more of a
fun pop so I hope you guys enjoy this
video I love you so much thank you for
watching and I'll see you guys soon bye
you
and party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
