a prom makeup tutorial this of course is
not only for those going to prom but any
girl who wants to look glamorous for a
special occasion night out Tuesday
afternoon whatever you please this is
one of my favorite looks I worn this all
throughout the holiday season and I
posted a picture of myself on Christmas
Day wearing this look and had lots of
comments asking if I could do a video on
that look and what shadows I was wearing
so four months later you're welcome
working at Matt for four years I got to
go through four glorious prom seasons
and almost every single year all the
girls would ask for the same look and
that was something smoky dramatic
neutral tones with some glitter or
sparkle involved so I thought I would
take those requests from all those years
and put it into one video for you
showing you how to get a professional
makeup look for yourself at home and not
have to go find someone to do it for you
this look and technique is going to look
good on all skin tones all eye colors
and all eye shapes truly you do not have
to use the exact colors or the exact
shadows that I am using of course you
use whatever you want whatever you think
is going to look best for yourself with
depending your occasion that you're
going to but this technique will look
good on everyone so I really hope that
you guys enjoy this video I enjoy doing
this video for you I actually love this
look so I hope you love it just as much
if you do get inspired and recreate this
look please make sure you tag me on all
social media sites I absolutely love
seeing what you guys come up with for
those of you going to prom I would love
to see your prom pictures honest to god
so I really hope that you guys enjoy
again I love you so much thank you for
watching and I'll talk to you soon bye
just a friendly reminder my Sigma beauty
brush expert box is back in stock and
will be available until Wednesday April
thirtieth which is one week from today
unless it sells out beforehand I will
list all of the direct links along with
the discount code for you guys in my
description bar below this video if any
of you are interested okay let's get
into the tutorial first thing I'm going
to do as always is prime my eyes I'm
using Mac Pro Longwear concealer in
shade nw20 this is a little bit lighter
than my natural skin tone which will
really help to give a nice blank
highlighted canvas as the background and
make your shadows show up a little bit
more intensely
not to mention such a smooth surface to
blend and work with your shadows on then
going in with good old scotch tape we're
going to take off a piece and put it on
the back of our hand just to get off
that intense stickiness so it doesn't
pull at your eye area then we're going
to match up kind of like winged eyeliner
from the angle of your eye going towards
the tail of your brow I did the same
method in my smokey cat eye tutorial and
it works like a charm then going with
makeup geek Peach Smoothie and creme
brulee we are going to take an e-40
brush and just dust this in our crease
we're going to start in the outer corner
because we prefer to have the darkest
color in the outer corner and wherever
you first lay your brush on the skin is
where you're going to have the most
pigment but we are going to blend this
all the way into the inner corner and as
that pigment is leaving the brush start
going upward and that will help blend it
out then going in with makeup geek
frappe we are going to take this color
which is a mid-tone brown it's not as
warm as the others which really helps
give more dimension to the look and we
are using a sigma e25 starting again in
that outer crease you can go right over
that tape which is what makes this look
so easy just that tape makes it
impossible to be too messy so just go
right over that tape blend it all the
way from inner and outer corner and make
sure you blend it out with a clean brush
another shadow by makeup geek is cocoa
bear we're going to take this on the
same e 25 by Sigma and put this
predominantly in that outer corner I
know this seems like a lot of shadows
but that's because it's a lot of shadows
and this is going to give you the best
result then going in with make it beak
corrupt any black shadow will do makeup
geek has the blackest shadow I've ever
personal
worked with before and this is a makeup
geek brush I don't know the name or
number of it I will sit down below in my
description bar of course but just going
right over top of that tape we are going
to blend it inward the great thing about
this is you do not have to worry about
blending to perfectly because the next
step will really take care of that for
us so just go over with any brush you
can have a little Coco bear left on it
or it can be blank whatever and then
just go over that black area just so
that you don't have any harsh lines
right in there but don't worry about
blending it on your lid we're going with
Too Faced shadow insurance glitter glue
huh one of the best products in the
world when working with intense pigments
or glitters at all
we're going to Pat this all over the lid
as you can see I use my finger then
we're going to go in with makeup geek it
to make a bit kind of day people utopia
this is such an amazing pigment but
listen to me when I say use a glitter
glue if you don't use a glitter glue it
can be a hot mess
packing this all over our lid we are
using a Mac 242 brush because when I
find working with messy intense pigments
like this you're going to have the best
outcome when you use the thinnest brush
possible a fat brush is going to take
too much of it and slop it all around
your face so a thin brush like this will
pack it on as you can see I am patting I
am NOT sweeping so you want to pat pat
pat pat pat this and you want to blend
and sweep your brushes when you're
blending your other shadows but with
this pigment just strictly Pat we did
the eyes first because otherwise this
would be all over our foundation so just
peeling off that tape you can see Shazam
baby you have got an intense cat eye
when you first peel it off it always
looks kind of weird like okay that's a
really really harsh line but you will
see how we are going to blend that out
and you can see up close it's intense
you could just pop on a pair of false
lashes like this and you would be good
to go just mascara your natural lashes
and you can see super pretty but I'm
going to show you how to do eyeliner if
you're interested because it is so easy
so you're going to follow that natural
line that the scotch tape made taking
any black liner I am using Maybelline
blackest black and I am just going to
follow that exact edge and then just
sculpt out my eyeliner as always
whenever you are doing eyeliner over any
sort of glitter sparkle chunk
pigment anything along that line just be
patient you're gonna have to go over a
few times back and forth to make sure
that it is black if you're a
perfectionist like me you have to go
over a lot of times because I hate
glitter being on my black liner and then
we're going to pop on a pair of false
lashes by the brand isquite oh I am not
positive of the name of these so I will
sit in my description bar right below
this video
they are very dramatic and very
prominent in the mail I looked at them
and I was like from oh sorry
how to bust out and dance for two
seconds moving on makeup forever
micro perfecting primer is what I'm
going to be using it's important to
prime and times where you really want to
make up to last last last in this primer
I do see a difference and I've really
been enjoying it so make sure you press
it into the skin it has a nice yellow
tint in it they have a few different
colors depending what you need then I'm
going in with NARS sheer glow foundation
I am using this shade Punjab and using
an f-86 kabuki brush one of these days
I'm going to switch it up on you guys
and use a different foundation brush and
you're gonna be like hell froze over
what's happening for right now I'm just
going to be using the f80 as always
impressing it into the skin I always
start in a pressing motion and then
whatever is left over you can kind of
move around in a sweeping motion but
pressing it into the skin will help it
last the longest
make sure you blend it down the jaw line
so you'll have a line of demarcation
then I'm going to fill in my brows I
will put my brow video down below in the
description bar I usually put all my
basic videos down there in case you're
curious but I am using the Anastasia
brow Wiz in the shade soft brown and
then caramel for the tail so bada-bing
we're going to finish that do you
whatever you want to do with your brows
have fun then we're going to go in with
the same concealer that we put on our
eyes in the beginning mac prolongwear
and w20 as you can see it's lighter than
the rest of my foundation which we are
going for because I want that
highlighted look I'm blending it out
with the Sigma F 86 brush which is my
Holy Grail foundation I'm sorry
concealer brush I absolutely love this
brush evening out our highlight under
our eyes we are going to highlight other
areas of our face using the Mac prep and
prime highlighter and shave light boost
which is the green yellow shade there is
also one that is a pinky shade and
I'm going to just put this around the
mouth area and then in between the
eyebrows this will help so that you
don't have that stark white under-eye
area and the rest of your face just
looks kind of strange you want to
balance it all out by doing this it's
very quick and very easy I know it looks
intense I promise you it's not you can
do this then I'm going to go ahead and
set that under-eye concealer using Mac
Pro highlighting powder in the shape
emphasized this is a stark white powder
so make sure that you are not going
overboard with it just a light tapping
is all you need again I tap this and
press this into the skin other than a
sweeping motion it will help to truly
absorb that powder and not crease
throughout the day as opposed to when
you just sweep it across the face
sometimes it can settle into the fine
lines even more then we're going to go
in with Smashbox suntan matte bronzer
and we're going to contour using our
NARS eita brush I highly recommend
contouring on prom as opposed to
bronzing because this will definitely
show up and pictures it'll make you look
nice and mature and really give you that
Kim K look that everyone is going for I
of course will put my contour video down
below
I am sculpting out my cheekbones and
then around the temples of my forehead
and then you can touch a little bit on
the jaw line and blend it all out then
going in with Mac shroom we are going to
put this right underneath our eyebrow on
that brow bone and a little tip if you
have issues blending your eyeshadow up
on top by the brows just kind of bring
this brush down and blend it into that
shadow that you already have on the eye
area and it will help bring it all
together then we're going to just put a
dabble of cocoa bear which was that warm
brown and our outer corner on the lower
lash then going in with whatever you
want creme Brule frappe anything you
have just take any pencil brush and just
blend back and forth back and forth this
is really going to open up your eyes so
I recommend you really blend don't be
scared
blend back and forth and really buff out
this under-eye area it'll make them look
much bigger especially in photos then
I'm going to use makeup geek I don't
know the name of this liner for the
first time in my life I'm at a loss for
words
I cannot remember the name of this liner
it's her black gel liner I'll list it
down below I love this for the waterline
because it does not
move and it does not burn and those are
the only two things I'm asking for in
life when it comes to liners then I'm
going to go in with Becca wild honey
blush broke saddest day ever
and I'm going to just blend this all
over the cheek area this is a bronzy
color with a little bit of terra cotta
in it so gorgeous it doesn't have a
super shimmer which I don't want a
really intense shimmer I want my cheeks
to be a little bit more matte and then
we're going to go in with a highlight
this is opal by Becca one of my all-time
favorite highlights ever and a sigma
tapered highlighting brush just to
highlight those cheekbones this again
will look absolutely beautiful in
pictures you won't be over shimmery over
dewy it'll be the perfect amount in
photos just a little tap of it on the
chin Cupid's bow and nose and you're
done I'm going to remove the foundation
that I have going on on my lips and you
can see how naturally pigmented my lips
are it's a little intense and it's
difficult for me to get new lips because
of how pigmented mine naturally are so
we are going to go in with Mac creme
brulee this is a cream Sheen I believe
so it's nice and creamy and on the shear
side and I'm going to top it off with
color your smile lighted lip gloss in
the shade nude if you guys have not
heard of these glosses yet you need to
jump on the bandwagon they're amazing
they have a mirror on the side of the
lip gloss tube and they light up so you
can do your lip gloss in the dark in
public it is definitely a prom and all
night out essential I love mine then I'm
going to set the masterpiece with Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray and
take a quick bath in this and we are all
done I love you guys so much thank you
for watching happy prom and I'll see you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
