tutorial for the first time in an entire
month which is so weird to me that I
have not filmed in makeup tutorial in a
month so anyways I think that I would go
ahead and start off these makeup
tutorials with a fun purple and Glory
smokey eye something okay I'm sorry I
like pears all over my face it's
something outside of the box from just
basic neutral and everyday looks so this
is definitely not something that's going
to be made for everybody and it's
definitely not something that you're
going to wear to lunch with Grandma but
this is definitely a going-out look
something fun something different I
always love using this technique it just
makes your eyes pop makes it look nice
and brown and bring lots of attention in
a positive way I did ask you guys on
Twitter about my new background if you
prefer to seek home decor or if you
would prefer to see like bookshelves
with makeup related or beauty related
items so at this moment as you can see
it is home decor it might change in a
couple of weeks let me know your
thoughts down below on my background my
home is finally starting to come
together so that's why I am finally able
to sit down and film a makeup tutorial
before this moment it was just like a
disaster anyways I'm going to stop
talking and let you guys get the
tutorial I will see you in the next few
days with another makeup tutorial so I
hope you enjoy I love you so much and
I'll talk to you soon bye first shade
I'm going to grab is wisteria and this
is an eyeshadow by makeup geek I'm going
to take it on a sigma e25 which is just
a little white blending brush and I'm
going to concentrate this on my crease
going back and forth all the way from
inner and outer corner this is the
perfect transition color for working
with Purple's it can be kind of tricky
to work with Purple's when you're
blending outward but this eyeshadow
makes it so simple then going in with an
e 40 which is just a bigger version and
a little bit fluffier we're just going
to blend all that out so that we don't
have any harsh edges as always just make
sure that you really take your time and
build baby steps because working with
purple is not like working with neutrals
then we're going to go in with Mac
nocturnal this is a really deep color
that's similar to Assyria which is much
deeper then we're going to concentrate
this on the inner and the outer corner
but we're going to leave the ball of the
eye in the very center of the lid blank
so as you can see I am really going to
town on that inner corner making sure
that we get some pigment in there
and then just like a rainbow motion
we're just going to carve out and go up
into that crease and then using a brush
it's clean with no pigment on it we're
just going to buff that out again
working with purples you've got to
constantly be blending blending blending
because you don't want any harsh lines
especially when you're working with
bright colors because then all of a
sudden you'll start looking like a clown
or like you came straight from the 80s
which sadly isn't the style anymore
anyways we're going to keep packing this
on this exact same way that I was just
talking about before leaving the center
of that eyelid blank then we're going to
go in with Mac sketch this is a very
popular shade at least it used to be and
it's so beautiful it's this gorgeous
wine color and we're going to go in with
an e 40 brush this is just a really
dense precise blending brush and I'm
going to pack that on that outer corner
and really sculpt out that crease as you
can see I'm also going to put this on my
inner corner as well but I'm going to
focus it on the outer corner that's
where I want the most depth to be as you
can see though I am going in the inner
corner and just like with the other
shade nocturnal we're just going to
carve out that eyelid and then of course
go back lightly blend blend blend blend
blend then we're going to go in with mac
cosmetics press pigment in a shade moth
we're gonna pick this up on our
fingertips because that's actually the
suggested way to use press pigments
there is no primer on your eyelids
necessary when working with these
pressed pigments I did pry my eye since
we're working with other shadows but if
you're working alone with these you
don't need a primer which is kind of
cool even though I always prime anyways
we're focusing this color on the self
center of our lid but as you can see
it's going to get other places and
that's okay because we're going to make
it a little bit more precise going in
with another brush spraying it with some
fix+ from Mac and then dabbing that
right on the ball of the lid just to
make it shiny or more metallic and stand
out even more so BAM oh eyeliner done
you guys said see me do eyeliner one too
many times so I figured I would just
spare you and move forward so I'm just
taking these ponds wipes from the
drugstore I'm just gonna clean up my
under eye area so that I don't have any
purple mixed into my foundation and my
concealer and it'll just help clean that
up and make the liner look more precise
then I'm going in with mascara just
going to prime for the lashes these of
course are velour and mink lashes my
absolute thing
your lashes of time are mean clashes
there is a discount code I listed in the
description bar below but these are the
girl your crazy style then I'm using the
hourglass veil fluid makeup this is a
really nice medium coverage very
luminous glow very very pretty
foundation it does have an SPF in it
which is nice for daytime use especially
once we enter the summer time but I'm so
drying these winter months I'm using it
right now because I need all the
moisture I can get then I'm going in
with Mac Pro Longwear concealer in the
shade NW 20 and then I'm using an f-86
brush from 86 brush from Sigma from
concealer to blend this out it's not
even a concealer brush I don't believe
but it is the bomb comm for concealer
I'm using Mac prep and prime highlighter
and light boost I'm going to just put
this on the highlights of my face and
then blend it out I have talked about
how I highlight in a few of my videos
and I will link that down below then of
course to set my under eye concealer I'm
going to use Mac Pro highlighting powder
in the shade emphasized what's new I
have been addicted to this bad boy
forever but let me just say that there
is no other powder to set your concealer
that is going to look as beautiful and
gorgeously highlighted and be as smooth
as this one it's a very underrated
product but I suggest it to everybody in
my life it is the best amazing anyways
now we're going to go in with the bare
minerals original foundation and I'm
just going to stipple this on the center
of my face just to set that foundation
and that's it then I'm using this brow
bar to go which I just got and I'm only
using the wax just to set my brows and
then moving on which I have loved so far
anyways I filled in my eyebrows but I
want to show that whole ordeal I have an
eyebrow video I'll link it down below
then i'm using mac cosmetics shroom it's
important to use a really neutral
highlight in this you don't want
anything too yellow or too warm and
shroom is the perfect highlight of life
so boom then i'm using makeup forever
this is the matte bronzer and shade 20
i'm using the NARS eita brush I am just
going to gently and lightly contour the
face nothing too intense we don't want
to really really sculpt out the face
since we have so much happening on the
eyes the rest of the face can be kind of
blended and neutralized then I'm going
in with NARS
blush in the shade love this is from
their newer collection and I got this at
Nordstrom and I'm just going to put this
on apples of my cheeks and lightly blend
backward it's gorgeous for these eyes
because it's a pink but it's not too
poorly or too pink and we don't want too
pink or too Corley okay wow it's like
Sally sells seashells down by the
seashore moving on I am using the Laura
Mercier highlighter and shade 0-1 with a
sigma tapered highlighter brush and just
dabbing that on the cheeks for some more
highlight the chin Cupid's bow and then
of course on the nose just in those
highlighted areas to bring that glow
then I'm going to go back and with
nocturnal from before on just a more
precise brush and just push that densely
into my lower lashline and then after
that I'm going to go back in with
wisteria again from makeup geek on a
pencil brush and just blend blend blend
blend blend back and forth this lower
lash line will really really complete
these eyes before as you can see that it
was not complete whatsoever and that
just these extra steps will really pull
it all together and make it look like a
completed look it'll make that liner
stand out that wing that we did and then
we'll highlight the inner corner again
using map shroom in this segment sealer
brush I will list that all down below
and then taking a little bit more of
that glitter on this Mac 252 brush and
just stippling that on the lower lash
line just to bring that glitter down
makes it a little bit more fun a little
bit more pop you could even apply some
purple eyeliner and your waterline to
make this even more fun then I'm going
in with NARS Chelsea girls and that is
going to complete my look it's not too
peachy or too pink again complements the
ice I hope you guys enjoy I love you so
much and I will see the next few days
bye
I'm on point today like honestly I'm not
gonna have any worse I am just like on
like Donkey Kong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
