tricky business wearing a strapless top
on camera and not looking naked so I'm
trying to like strategically sit right
here and not move so that I don't make
it okay so anyways today's video is
going to be a makeup tutorial on this
look right here I asked you guys on
Twitter a couple days ago to send me
photos of fall looks that you would like
to see an inspiration for me and a ton
of you guys sent me photos of purple
smokey eyes and it's none of you guys
we're tweeting me that you wanted to see
purple smokey eye so I was like alright
majority rules we shall do some purple
smokey eyes and not to mention I've also
seen a lot of people leaving comments
all over my socials the past couple of
days saying that they want me to do a
look that is a cat eye but does not
involve a sharp wing liner because it's
too difficult for them to do and I
totally understand that winged liner can
be so difficult to really get it down
even once you feel like you're an expert
at it it still takes an extra five to
ten minutes to do and you stop just at
their like okay are the wings even is it
sharp enough to cut a bitch I get it
it's a lot so I wanted to create a cat
eye for you guys it requires no eyeliner
and we are still working in the purple
smokey eyes so I'm trying to meet as
many needs as possible as many requests
as possible if I'm saying so oh my god
that is a bug so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy this smokey purple cat eye and
that's it I will see you soon okay so
first things first I'm going to be
priming my eyes I am personally using
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer but
whatever primer works for you go ahead
and use that as long as your eyes are
prime that's all that matters now we're
going to be going in with some good old
scotch tape I'm going to be ripping off
some of this and then I'm going to be
placing it on the back of my hand the
reason we do that is because we want to
get off any harsh stickiness so that
it's not too harsh on our eyes because
we don't want to be like pulling really
tightly at it so now I'm going to do is
line up with my lower lash line going up
towards the corner of my eyebrow and
placing it there and you do not have to
be too precise with this because I will
show you how to clean it up if they end
up being uneven with one another so
first shadow I'm going to go in with is
makeup geek frappe and I'm going to be
using a morphe m4 4-1 brush which is
kind of a longer haired bristle and I'm
using that for this because I want to
start lower in the crease today than I
normally do normally I
start with a higher transition color but
today we're going to start lower and
we're really going to flick it out on
the outer corner and then a quick little
break down to the friends theme song you
can't listen to their friends theme song
and not have a quick little dance party
come on so basically we're going to be
doing is putting this generously on the
outer corner of the eye and then
blending it inward as you have less
product on your brush you want to go
upward and you want to really flick that
out on top of the scotch tape that
scotch tape is going to give us a really
clean line so don't worry about being
sloppy now we're going to go in with Mac
cranberry which is such a beautiful
color for the fall just throw this all
over your lid and you're good to go
honestly using the exact same brush I'm
going to put that in the exact same
place that I did the makeup geek frappe
it's just going to give a lot of
dimension and again we're really going
to flick that out over that scotch tape
to give that intense wing I'm going to
try to keep this as low as possible and
not go as high with it as I did with
frappe because it does have shimmer and
I personally don't think that shimmer
going up really high on the lid area can
be too flattering so we're going to try
to keep it a little bit lower and then
just blend it out now going in with Mac
and bark which is a super super dark
chocolatey brown I'm going to be using
the morphe m4 4-3 brush and I'm going to
really concentrate this on the outer
corner of the eye over that scotch tape
packing on really generously keeping it
very low and then bringing it slightly
into the inner corner you will see here
as I pack this on in the inner corner
and then I start to blend it out I'm
going to take my brush and really flick
it up on the scotch tape kind of
creating a wave motion so that it goes
really up and intense as a cat eye but
then kind of dips down into the crease
area so it kind of looks like a wave if
you know what I mean you can see what
I'm doing right there now I'm going to
grab some makeup geek poppy such a fun
shade I'm going to go back in with the
m4 4-1 brush and just put a little pop
of this on the outer corner of the eye
and then slightly blending it inward I
just felt like I needed something to
mesh the colors together and go over top
of the cranberry in the frappe and just
make it all pop so that's why I went in
with frappe now I'm going to go in with
Mac sketch one of my favorite colors
ever I've used this in many tutorials I
personally think that it is one of the
best most universal wearable Purple's
out there because it has a little tiny
bit of shimmer but it's not too shimmer
it really feels like a matte but it's
very easy to apply
and it's too great dark wine shade so
I'm going to pack that all over the
entire lid and this is going to be our
main color on the lid I am using a sigma
e55 any a flat brush that you have will
work to pack the shade on I'm really
going to make sure that I've come all
the way in on the inner socket and all
the way out snap scotch tape and I'm
going to go back in with the m4 for
three and make sure that we have all
these colors blended beautifully
together
and again concentrating on the outer
corner by the scotch tape to make sure
it's very dark
now we shall reveal so you can see how
sharp our edges are it's amazing you
could be as sloppy as you want and it's
like oh no damage done so I'm going to
be going in with the Mac Pro emphasize
powder
any really light powder will do the
trick but I want to show you guys how to
kind of clean this situation up so that
it's not too intense for you so I'm just
going to take any synthetic brush you
want and I'm going to begin to apply
that powder to the top of the brow bone
blending it downward this is going to
make that line and not so harsh and
really diffuse it and you can go in with
this powder as many times as you want to
really clean this up so that it's not
like what BAM and your face now I'm
doing is I'm taking a liner brush and
I'm dipping it in a little bit of makeup
remover and I'm literally going to erase
a little bit of the shadow because they
weren't perfectly even so I really
wanted to even them out and then what
I'll do is I'll go in with a q-tip I'll
diffuse it a little bit more so like I
said don't be too obsessed with the
scotch tape initially because it's not
even there's so many tricks that I want
to fill you guys and on to really make
it look perfect and diffuse it so it's
not too intense and you don't have to do
liquid liner
at the same time you still have the same
effect now I'm going to move on to my
skin see the eyes are pretty easy right
I think it's pretty easy especially for
such a dramatic look I think that scotch
tape and those tricks make it really
easy to achieve this cat eye
so after probably my skin I'm going to
go on with foundation and I have been
loving this foundation for the past
month and this is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD stick foundation it is really
full coverage so what I do is I
literally just swipe it on my face and
then I'm going to go in with an M 439
brush and I'm going to spread some fix+
I'm like I need a little more let's get
real and I'm going to begin to just
blend this out it is so blendable and as
you blend it out it doesn't break up and
it doesn't get shear like it remains a
full coverage as you're blending it
which I love and I
so I'm using the fix+ which is going to
make it a little bit more sheer and
coverage so if you don't use the fix+
it's going to be very full coverage but
I don't want it to be too intense and be
cake face because things can tend to
settle in my lines so I like to share
things out a little bit with the fix+
now I'm going to be doing concealer you
guys know the drill I am using the Urban
Decay Naked weightless concealer I
cannot say enough good things about this
concealer oh my gosh I think it is the
most amazing concealer ever I mean Mac
Pro Longwear is great too but this one
isn't as drying which is why I love it
so much because I feel like it looks so
much more natural on the under eyes now
I'm going to go back in with the same
Mac Pro emphasized that I use on my brow
and I'm going to be mixing it with the
anesthesia banana shade that you can
find in her contour kit or you can buy
it individually those two shades
together I'm just going to lightly tap
it on the whole under eye area with my
mouth hanging open I feel like I can't
work with my eye area without my mouth
hanging open now I'm going to do the
eyebrows using Anastasia brows and voila
brows are done I feel like there was no
point what's the point watch me do my
brows we've seen that five thousand
times I'm highlighting just the very tip
of the brow at the high point with Mac
nylon just a little bit I didn't want to
go too overboard and then moving on to
the under eye area I am using makeup
geek chickadee the reason I use this
color is because I feel like chickadee
and Mac rule those like really pale
orange shades they look so beautiful as
a base underneath of other colors
especially when you're doing a smoky eye
a lot of people can fear these colors
because they're so Orange but they
really look like they're just beaming
through the other colors that you choose
to apply on top of them and they give
such a radiant glow to the eyes which is
why I love them so I'm going to just be
lining my waterline using a black kohl
liner my personal favorite is by art and
see in I think it is the most amazing it
lasts all day and it is black as night
so through many many trial and errors
with these liners this one is not my
favorite and then I'm going to be going
in with none other than makeup geek Coco
bear I'm sorry you guys it's my favorite
and I'm using an E 55 definer brush by
Sigma and I'm going to put that all over
the lower lash line and blending out
that black and mixing it into that
orange e chickadee that we have the
thing with purple smokey eyes if you
don't want to look like you're going to
get bruised I would suggest
putting some warm shades in there with
it because it makes it look very fall
appropriate and when you go with more
warmer purples it's easier to work with
as opposed to cool tones can easily look
like you're bruised so that's just a tip
I'm highlighting the inner corners of my
eye with Mac nylon and then I'm going to
pop on some lashes I'm using Lily lashes
in the style Mykonos this is I think the
fifth time that I've worn this exact
pair and are still going strong they're
holding up well guys so I'm impressed so
once we have on our false lashes I'm
just going to coat my lower lashes with
some mascara I'm using Mac I think it's
called extended play now it used to be
gigablack lash but just a thin coat of
that on my lower lashes and then I am
going to move on to contouring thy face
and I'm going to be using the Mac shade
stir sculpting powder which I raved
about in my last video I think it's such
a beautiful color and I'm applying that
with the NARS eita brush an oldie but a
goodie and I'm starting at the top of my
ears bringing that down towards the
center of my mouth I'm sorry corner of
my mouth and going about halfway down
not bringing it all the way to the lips
because that can be really intense
bringing about halfway down and then
blending everything out I'm using an E
34 brush from morphe to apply that color
all over my hairline just to warm up the
skin and then I will go around the jaw
line around that contour just to really
make sure that we're buffing everything
into the skin and we don't have any
harsh lines because at first it will
look harsh but you just have to keep
blending that's my motto in life you
guys let's get real I'm going to go in
with alarm Mercier translucent powder
I've done this in the past few videos it
really is just such an easy way to clean
up your contour and give you a nice
sharp look without having to put in the
effort of really like going in and
chiseling yourself out so while I let
that sit I'm going to apply the Becca
blush in the shade sweetpea which is
perfect for this look because it's got
like a plummy purple undertone in it
which matches the eyes beautifully and
especially once we go on with the lip
it's going to be very monochromatic and
really complement everything so I'm
going to go ahead and blend that out
using a sigma tapered highlighting brush
but any brush will do you can do this
with a sponge
it'll be fine and then I'm going to be
going in with a Nastasia highlighter in
the shade peach nectar I'm going to be
using this only on the apples of my
cheeks this doesn't work on my
cheekbones as a highlight because it has
a lot of peachy pink in it but I'm just
going to apply it as like a blush topper
and then for highlights
I'm actually
using one that I can't really talk about
yet but I am mixing it with champagne
pop but you guys won't know about it
very soon I'm sorry I'm not trying to be
mean from is going to put that on the
top of my cheekbones with an morphe m5o
one brush and then for lips I'm going to
be using the dose of colors liquid
lipstick in the shade
which is such a beautiful shade it's
such a wonderful nude for the Fall
with like the depth that it has and it's
not too nude and it's not pink you're
I'm saying it's a great great nude so I
really really love this shade so yeah
once you have on your lip that you
choose this look is complete and then of
course last but not least I'm going to
take a quick bath in Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray this is an absolute
must and then once we dry off we are
completely done so I hope that you guys
enjoy this look make sure you send me
more requests and give me more
inspiration for looks you want to see I
love you guys and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
