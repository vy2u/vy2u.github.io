distractions in this house my god get
other way
my last video my favorite Mac shadows I
was wearing this purple look and I got
like a million and one requests I wish
and I posted a picture on Instagram and
a bunch of you asked me to do it there
then I had some private messages from
girls asking me to do it asked me where
the hell have you been I've had a lot of
drama in my life this last week it's
been very chaotic we I live in Florida
by the way and I know I feel like I'm
talking to my friends and you guys
should like already know this that I'm
like oh yeah there's people watching
this who don't physically know me and I
forget about you guys Himba love you
yeah I live in Florida and there was
this awful hurricane debbie such a
little bitch no she's a big bitch
actually so yeah I was attacked by her
entire basically just got back here the
first time in a couple of days it's been
like all so yes so this is a little bit
different of a video that I have done
before but um a Mac something that we
used to do is we would show the customer
how to do their makeup for the daytime
and then we would tell them how to
change up from day tonight just using a
few products even though right now you
guys might not think this is a daytime
look I know I personally would wear this
at nighttime but I'm going to show you
how to add a couple more products to
make it even darker and smokier and more
fun and amped up
so that you know it can be more like
clubbing enjoy and comments subscribe
rate find me on Instagram whatever the
hell you people want to do
okay so I'm freaking out because I have
no makeup on but the first thing I'm
going to do is prime my eyes with Mac's
pan only Paint Pot use whatever you have
even if it's a concealer but you need to
put something sticky on your eyelids
otherwise doing your eyeshadow is just
pointless
so prime your eyes now soft brown
eyeshadow as always I'm going to take
any fluffy brush you have and just dust
this in my crease I'm taking all the way
down to the very lower corner of my
outer eye and I'm going to take it up as
high as you want and all the way in now
I'm making sure I bring this all the way
in to my inner corner because we're
going to be going with so many purples
that you're going to need that Brown to
blend everything out so that there's no
lines so make sure you bring it all the
way back and forth and when she'll buy
promotions now I'm going in with
satellite dreams and I'm going to take
this with a flat shader brush and start
in the inner corner and just Pat it all
over my lid now as you can see I'm not
doing this like precisely I'm just
getting it on there and I'm not taking
it all the way to the outer corner
because I'm going to go in with a
different color there so just pushing it
all over the place from the inner corner
and just go up into that crease and try
not to pass that crease quite yet you
don't want to get too ahead of yourself
later if you want to go back and pass
that crease you can and now I'm going in
with a clean brush and it's okay if it
has a little bit of product on it of
something like soft brown but mainly
clean and I'm just going to swipe that
back and forth just to again eliminate
any harsh edges because that's not a
cute look now I'm going in with
nocturnal I'm using a blending brush to
apply this color it's not necessary that
you use a blending brush for the shade
this is just our transition shade from
light to dark I'm just using this brush
because I really like the way the goat
hair deposits the color all onto my
eyelid so I'm just going to pack this in
my outer corner and you'll see me slowly
start to bring it up just a little bit
in my crease um it's not important that
you get too much of this on because we
are going to go in with an even darker
color to really make that crease pop but
you can see how light-handed I am using
this I was much harder when I was down
deeper in my crease but now that I'm up
there I'm holding on to the very tip of
my brush even though you can't see it
with just like three fingers and I am
just like ever so lightly dusting it
back and forth because the lighter
handed you are with your brush the
lighter it's going to put the product on
your eyes make sure that you are aware
of how high you are taking this color
because you don't want to take this too
high because then you'll get your lashes
on and it'll look really weird and it
can totally ruin the look so for now try
to keep it a little bit lower and when
you get the lashes on you can make it a
little more precise um I'm just going
over that same color before the
satellite dreams just again just to make
it a little bit bolder now I'm going in
with sketch this is an extremely popular
color from Mac it's a really pretty wine
shade and I'm gonna put this in the
lower area of my crease and as you can
see when I first put on I'm just packing
it in there pretty harshly and just like
dab dab dab and then I go back and forth
really lightly and those windshield
wiper motions um with this color I don't
like to immediately start wiping it on
because I feel like it falls on your
face so first I pack it on and then I
wipe back and forth um this is just
experience this isn't something that
everybody might feel the same about it's
just my personal opinion and then I'm
just lightly gonna dust it up just like
I deal with that other color and then
I'm going back with an empty brush or
you can put more soft brown whatever you
feel you need and I'm just going over
again just to help blend it up and out
with no harsh lines now I'm just filling
up my brush with that sketch and I'm
just gonna Pat it in that lower crease
I'm going to just leave it there to
leave that depth and dimension in my
outer corner now I'm going to go in with
Maybelline eye studio gel liner in black
I'm not going to go too much into
technique of how I apply my liquid liner
because it really is a video in itself
and I know I said before that I will
make one I'm just taking my sweet time
not making one because it's not a fun
video for me to make honestly because I
have to do my eyeliner all the time and
it's honestly my least favorite part of
doing my makeup when it comes to to
doing my eyeliner I'm just like oh again
I'm so over it you know it's just it's
time-consuming you know it's like the
look isn't complete without it but it's
just not fun and with gel eyeliners I
physically cannot do it on myself
without
having to pull my eyelid taunt and I
hate that because I know I'm causing
premature wrinkles but honestly it's
just my weak spot I'm much better at
applying eyeliner on other people than I
am on myself but hey you know at least I
can admit it right but I am just doing a
semi thick line with a little bit of a
wing as usual and now I'm going to take
a highlighter color any highlighting
shade will work and just put under my
brow the only suggestion I would make is
to not use anything too gold as your
highlight because I have seen that it
can tend to clash with the purples
okay I'm concealing my battle wound my
husband like scratch the crap out of me
when we were like roughhousing the other
night but it's okay no hard feelings
okay so once again my foundation was
looking super yellow on my face and I
don't know why because it does not look
like this in person but for some reason
it looks like I'm painting jaundice on
myself in this camera and my camera was
actually pretty expensive and for some
reason it is acting like it is so cheap
because the quality is awful sometimes
and I'm really disappointed but anyways
I am just putting on foundation now
normally you can't put foundation
underneath your eyes like I'm doing
otherwise you can see they will crease
but I am using a certain kind of
foundation that you can do that and I'll
be making a video on it soon so hang
tight now I'm using slep cover-up from
Mac in two different shades in nw20 and
NW 25 because one is too light and one
is a little too dark so I'm mixing them
together to get my perfect shade and
this is a sheer concealer so it looks
like I'm putting on a lot but when you
actually get it on there it's not that
much if you have super super dark
circles under your eyes this isn't
really going to do much for you but I
don't have really intense circles
they're just like mild so I'm just using
this I'm blending it down and a V and
then out towards my upper cheekbone now
I am going into my eye brows I'm just
brushing them out so they're not crazy
and all over my freaking forehead and
then I'm gonna go in with cork as always
I do my eyebrows the exact same
basically every single day I rarely use
anything else for my eyebrows but I do
on occasion umm I just go in I follow
the
natural shape of my eyebrows I don't go
out of the edges or anything crazy and
this shade is actually the most perfect
shade for basically every single color
eyebrow unless you are extremely
dark-skinned with extremely dark hair
otherwise cork is an amazing shade and
then I go back with the spool which I
don't think I show I just like brush it
out to make it look more natural
now I'm highlighting my inner tear-duct
with any shade again I would recommend
not anything too yellow but you want to
pop that in there before you put any
color on under your eyes and I'm going
to throw on lashes these are the same
lashes as always they're red cherry
number 43 and I place them on and then I
use a tweezer to get them on just a
little bit tighter to ensure that
they're on there nice and good and I
pull them together with my natural
lashes so that I know that they're
connected while I'm waiting for my other
eyelash glue to dry I'm just putting any
powder underneath my eyes to consent my
concealer everybody doesn't have to do
that but I do otherwise I get creasing
especially in the humidity here it's
awful once again I'm just using that
tweezer and it kind of freaks me out
watching myself do it oh I'm going to
take that same satellite dreams that I
use on my eyelid and I'm going to just
dust it underneath my eye back and forth
just really light I'm not doing anything
too dark yet and then I'm going to put
mascara on my real lashes and I choose
to do this afterwards and not before
because I think it looks more natural to
tie the false lashes and natural lashes
together I do not go up on my fake
lashes though otherwise your lashes are
destroyed and you will not look good I
do not like the look of lashes with
mascara on them it makes them much
cheaper than they need to look I'm just
mass carrying my bottom lashes which
again is optional you don't have to do
this I just choose to otherwise I just
feel like butt naked then I'm going in
with shade star this is a contouring
powder by Mac Pro and I'm just gonna
lightly put this on the hollow parts of
my cheeks and dust up a little bit I do
not want to do too much of this because
I don't want a lot of contour in this
if you're going to do anything blush is
the most important in this to kind of
even out those dramatic purple eyes do
you have going on so I'm just putting on
a really light amount of that and then
buffing it out with my kabuki brush and
then I'm going to go in with utterly
game which is like a peachy orange any
peachy orange blush will do um
peaches is a really beautiful one by Mac
as well and I'm going to put this on the
apples of my cheeks and blend it up I'm
using this peachy color because if you
do anything too pink you're going to
start to look like Barbie and 80s and
you have to be careful careful with
those purple eyes not to do anything too
intense now I am going to take soft and
gentle which is like a silver based
highlighter from Mac and put that all
over my cheekbones then I had a dilemma
with my lipstick it was very dramatic
but I ended up just using this Revlon
lip gloss
I think it's called Bellini it's from
the new collection I just got it like a
couple weeks ago and I'm actually really
impressed by it I'm using clear brow gel
and my eyebrows just to set them another
must for me otherwise my eyebrows will
be all over my face in a couple of hours
and they're like crazy and then I'm
using fix+ which is my favorite products
in the entire world I'm going to spray
it all over myself to finish my makeup
off so do we love it and then if you're
going for a daytime look you are done
and that's it but if you want to go for
something more amped up stay tuned
you
now I'm going to go back in with
nocturnal which is the transition shade
that we use on our eyelids and I'm going
to use that on a pencil brush and just
go back and forth underneath my eye all
the way from outer corner to inner
corner then I'm going to go in with
stars and rockets which is such an
amazing color it is like a pearly
iridescent pinky purple I'm going to tap
that in my inner corners then after that
I'm going to take any black eye Kohl
that you have but it's important that
it's a Kohl and that it's nice and
creamy otherwise this won't work I am
using smolder by Mac and I'm lightly
putting that on there I'm not going to
rub it really hard but just a light thin
line now I'm using this NYX glitter on
the top inner corner and the bottom
lashline this glitter is so pretty it
has like all the colors of the rainbow
in it so it really stands out and make
sure you get that whole in our corner
and you really round it out in there
that way this look really pops because
that's really going to be the main focus
of this entire eye look so after that
you are completely done so I hope that
you will enjoy this let me know what you
think in the comments thanks so much for
watching and have a great day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
