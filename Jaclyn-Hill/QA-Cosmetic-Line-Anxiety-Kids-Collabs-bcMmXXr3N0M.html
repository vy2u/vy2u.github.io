about is when are you having kids IRA
automatic okay hey guys for today's
video I'm going to be doing a question
and answer for you I jumped on snapchat
and I said I was going to be filming in
my Q&amp;amp;A today so to leave me your
questions on Twitter and the tweets are
rolling in so quickly right now so I'm
gonna try to answer as many questions as
possible and not dilly-dally along on my
answers um I hope you guys enjoy I love
doing q and A's because I just get to
kind of like chill and give you guys
answers I sound like an idiot let's get
started people please don't mind my
overly tan hands I know it's not cute
I'm fully aware of this I put on the
8-hour Tanner last night and I applied
way too much on my hands and now it's
like the dead giveaway that I solved in
sharing like a lil prettier by putting
some rings on but I'm like I don't think
anything's gonna help at this point
so as I'm scrolling down Twitter I see
overall the number one ask question is
am I going to have my own cosmetic line
is that a rumor or is it true so I
figured that that's the question that I
would start with since it is like
literally every other tweet and yes I am
going to have my own cosmetic line I
have been dropping hints and I've been
talking about it for years now my mom
and I have been working on it for three
years I am doing everything every single
little tiny detail on my own I am the
only one paying for I am the only one in
control it has been such a learning
experience it has been so hard my mom
and I are working our butts off but I
wanted to be able to make sure that
whatever I put my name on is like fully
mine and I can take full responsibility
and can be my creation so that's what
we're working on right now the launch
keeps getting pushed back back back back
back because we keep running into walls
and it's just been it's been a learning
process for sure it's been amazing I'm
so thankful for uh but you guys will see
it next year
Alex Simpson said I absolutely love you
and your videos thank you Alex and she
asked what is your favorite thing about
being a youtuber and honestly there's
like two different aspects to it my
favorite thing about being a youtuber
for myself personally is the
self-confidence that has given me
because I when I started YouTube just
like every other girl basically which is
very insecure and like my own skin I
hate
the sound of my own voice I hated the
way I looked on camera my face just
looked so crooked and weird I hated the
way my mouth looks like I was just so
hard on myself and now that I've gotten
so used to seeing myself on camera all
the time I've just gotten more
comfortable in my own skin and it just
made me like love me more now of course
also looking at myself on camera
everyday I'm also like I want you to fix
this about my face oh that doesn't look
cute Oh a little nip and tuck it also
makes you harder like harder on yourself
in some aspects but it's also made me
love myself and the second thing like
overall about being a youtuber is the
connection that I have with so many
people that I've never met I think that
it is truly a beautiful thing when I'm
just like walking through the mall or
walking down the street I swear to God
it's like I will see I will feel
something like I'll feel something on
the right hand side and I'll turn and
I'll see someone looking at me and I
will know like we know each other I have
like this connection with my subscribers
even though I've never met you and
you've only seen me and I've never seen
you I swear it's like 99% of time when I
see a subscriber I'll like look across
and I'll be like hey girl and we'll make
eye contact and it's like I just know I
know you it's so crazy but I just have
this connection with my subscribers and
I love it
I absolutely love it like any time I've
ever anywhere with a friend a family
member and I meet a subscriber whenever
we walk away they always say the same
thing they're like I would have never
known you'd even know that girl like you
guys just had such a connection I'm like
I know that's how it is but that's like
my overall favorite thing for sure
hailey Coogan asked what's filming
camera do you use girl I am currently
using the EOS 5d so I have gone through
so many cameras and I am now at the 5d
so it's like it's like a camera like you
have to plug in I have like a viewfinder
right here like I'll literally show you
what my viewfinder looks like like this
is what my view that's kind of creepy
looking right but this is what my
viewfinder looks like it's literally a
TV that I got for like 30 bucks and I
have it plugged in with an HDMI cable
and then I use the Canon EOS 5d and I go
back and forth with different lenses all
the time for those of you who are
curious
saundra asks if you could be one of your
dogs who would it be it would definitely
be
franki because I have a soft spot in my
place for Georgie for sure like to me
I'm like Georgie's the like
misunderstood awkward one who's just
special and you know like he can come
off kind of mean and aggressive but he's
got such a sweet heart
whereas Frankie is just like stupid and
loves his life like he will just like
trample over everything and not even
notice with his little tail wagging just
so happy to be alive like he lives with
his head in the clouds so I would be
Frankie I shot or maybe her name is
pronounced Ayesha I'm so sorry if I
don't have that right girl but it's a
she said was there a point in your life
that you thought that you were in love
with someone else besides John like a
boyfriend absolutely I made a video all
about my ex-boyfriend that I dated for
three years before John it's called my
dysfunctional relationship and I talk
all about that but yes i 100% thought I
was in love I still think that I was in
love with him to a certain degree like
for sure like that was my idea of love
that was the most that I was able to
love him but yeah I mean I believe that
you can love more than one person in a
lifetime romantically like that's just
my beliefs I don't think that there's
like only one person out there for
everybody if you guys watch the show
friends Monica one time makes a
statement to Chandler and she says like
I don't believe in soulmates she says I
believe that you find someone and you
fall in love with them and you work your
ass off to make it work and that's what
I believe in like I believe that you
find someone you have a connection you
fall in love with them and you have to
work very hard at keeping that
relationship
Clarett --i asked will you ever do a
meet-up in london I love you so much I
want to beat you so bad thank you so
much the fact that someone wants me to
like travel across the ocean to come
meet them is like so surreal and crazy
and sweet um I would love to do a
meet-up in London are you kidding me I
would love to go to London I'm very
scared of traveling over water I finally
got over my fear of flying in general
like I can fly anywhere in the US and
not be scared anymore thank you God and
essential oils and my iPad um but I'm
still scared to travel overseas that
turned down so many opportunities to go
anywhere like London and Greece and
Dubai I've turned it down some I know
it's stupid I know I know what it's like
I have to get over that fear I have to
at some point and once I do I will go to
London
Laura asked if you had to choose one
favorite pinky nude lipstick of all time
which would it be love from Argentina
oh she's part of snapchat fan love you
girl um one favorite pinky nude lipstick
of all time I think it would be blush
new by Tom Ford honestly blush nude or
she by house of dolls how do you keep
your hair color so perfect and how often
do you color okay so I don't feel like I
keep my hair color so perfect um but
thank you I'm her name is Heidi I get my
hair color like religiously every five
weeks if my hair goes six weeks you'll
really see my roots now it's not even
because the color that I get it color
that often but it's because once my
roots growing it's very ugly like I
don't know if you can see my roots in
this light they're like a sin of
centimeter long right now um but once my
roots come in it is not good like the
red with the roots and I'm very picky
about that so I get my hair done
religiously every six weeks I'm sorry
five weeks um and as far as keeping the
color up I wash my hair with a red
shampoo and conditioner that really
makes a difference in the vibrancy of it
before I use that my hair would dole out
very fast but now that I use that it
lasts a lot longer and I'll leave the
the name of the shampoo and conditioner
down below it's called davon s but I
always get questions about it so I'll
leave it down there in the description
bar ooh
Gabby asked the hardest question of all
time JLo or Beyonce oh I know that
everyone out there is gonna say Beyonce
but I can't help it you guys I saw
Beyonce live I saw her performance and I
saw JLo and honestly after seeing JLo
she made me love her a hundred times
more like I cried so many times watching
JLo it was emotional it was amazing
she's so talented she's so happy doing
it she smiles the whole time she's just
so zesty and full of life and when I met
her she was just so kind and yes I have
to say jingle oh my god I just like JLo
but it's JLo I love her
she's my queen Abbey Wendell asked what
was your favorite part about
collaborating with Becca I love you so
much I love you too Abbi thank you um my
favorite part about collaborating with
Becca I would have to say is the facts
again my answers are going to sound kind
of strange to certain things but for me
personally it was just kind of a thing
of like just then believing in me what
it did for me on the inside like just
the way it made me feel was my favorite
part about the collab
raishin just the fact that like they
gave me a chance and Sephora gave me a
chance and the fact that they just
reached out to me and wanted to work
with someone like me it just made me
feel great about the world that we live
in you know it's like this someone will
just take someone so small and be like
here let's do this it just I don't know
I don't know my answer might sound weird
but it just made me feel like amazing
made me feel amazing and just so blessed
and I see my basic before was really
cool too but like what it did like um to
my heart like was more important to me
so yeah anyways reefa I think that's how
you pronounce her name I'm sorry I suck
so bad at name sometimes she asked would
you ever write a book slash
autobiography I would totally buy that
actually Sony's is I my mom and I keep
saying that I'm going to write a book
soon like not soon meaning like this
year but like I'm searching turn ting
what I'm turn taking up I'm turning at
26 and I would like to write a book by
the time I'm 30 um just like talking
about everything cuz I'm very honest and
open here with you guys but I mean I
haven't told you everything I've given
you like quite a bit but not even 50% of
my life and 50% of what actually goes on
off-camera and I would love to one day
just like tell the truth about just like
not like I've ever lied but just like
tell my truth like where I came from and
what my my background has been what goes
on when the camera turns off and like my
real life and my issues and try to help
it to encourage other girls because I
feel like everything can seem so perfect
on camera and it's not like that at all
and I know that some people hate that
sometimes when I tell everyone like oh
yeah social media is just smoke and
mirrors I have people commenting like
I'm unsubscribing because you're saying
that it's smoke and mirrors and people
don't want to believe that people want
to believe that like my life is perfect
and everyone's lives are perfect but I
mean it really is like we're such normal
people like such normal people we get in
fights with our husbands and like I sit
on the couch and I eat ice cream and I'm
like up such a fast like I read my
comment sometimes and people make me cry
about things they say like I'm a person
so I would like to write a book all
about everything
Alison frost asked when have you felt
the most challenged oh that is a good
question um with what I'm currently
working on there's some stuff that I'm
working on that no one
that I have been working on with someone
for a full two years it's going to be
it's about to be a full two years that
I've been working on this and it has
been so challenging like oh my god like
every obstacle every speed bump every
roadblock that we could have hit we have
it was supposed to only take less than a
year and we're about to hit the two-year
mark right to a year-and-a-half mark
we're at a year and a half right now of
how long it's been really challenging
you guys will see soon though you'll see
Mary asks if you could travel to any
place or city in the world where would
you go and who'd you go with love you
love you too Mary um that's a good
question I've been I've answered this
before and I feel like it changes all
the time but I really think that I would
go to Santorini
um Greece but I my entire life my entire
family has always wanted to go to Bora
Bora like we've talked about Bora Bora
since I was maybe like 13 years old and
we've always thought I wasn't we're
gonna go to Bora Bora and like when I
get over my fear of flying and like
something amazing happens I really
really want to just take my entire
family to Bora Bora one day like that'd
be incredible but it's so far from me
it's like I almost two days of traveling
so I'm so scared but a Santorini I am
like dying to go to Santorini and I
would want to go there with Jon of
course I mean but like I'm the kind of
person it's like the more the merrier
like I want everybody to come let's go
together one of my fan pages asked
Jaclyn are you still planning on moving
and yes me and Jon are still planning on
moving to a new house but I mean it's
just it's not it's not in God's time
it's just not happening right now it's
obviously not supposed to happen right
now so I have put the house hunting on
hold and figured that we would just wait
until 2017 the house that I live in is
not ideal it has its issues we're
renting I'm dying to buy I'm dying to be
a homeowner but there's nothing in the
area that I need to be in that's popping
up right now so it's just not meant to
be so I am I have this feeling that 2017
is going to be my year I haven't feeling
like next spring like that's going to be
my moment like the right house is going
to pop up and it's going to happen so in
the meantime we're fine we live in a
great place we're comfortable we're fine
Alena asked will you be collaborating
with
any other makeup brand soon Schuyler
asked if or when you have kids do you
have any names in mind and I've said
before that John I don't know if we're
gonna have kids it's really not in um in
the cards for us we have four nieces and
nephews and especially now that my
sister lives here with her two kids like
me and John are around children all the
time we have been ever since we got
married we got married married we got
married Talia um which is now the oldest
she's ten she was three so I mean like
we've been around kids forever we've
been here as they've been born and
growing up in birthdays and all that
jazz so we definitely have like the
fulfillment of children around us but
it's just not in our plans to have kids
people are obsessed with having kids
like I can't even tell you how many
tweets and comments I get every day from
people asking me and John are gonna have
kids but here's the thing is it's like
if I had a baby do you guys realize that
I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing
like I'm doing it like I want to be on
snapchat every day like hey I wouldn't
be making youtube videos probably as
frequently like if I was trying to start
a company and be a youtuber and be a mom
like I'm the kind of person if I'm gonna
have a baby I'm not going to talk to my
baby off to my husband and a nanny like
I'm going to be a full-time hands-on
dedicated mom that is a human being that
is a huge responsibility and I'm gonna
be like obsessed with pouring every
moment of my love and time into that
child and it would take up a lot of my
time and I wouldn't be able to do
everything that I'm doing right now so
if I had a baby it would kind of mess up
my plans right now if I accidentally got
pregnant like would I like freak out and
be devastated no a child is always a
beautiful thing you know but everyone is
always asking about kids it's not my
plans right now but yes John I actually
have discussed what our kids names would
be if we had a boy and a girl and we
already know the names that they would
be if it happened we've had them picked
out for like six years uh but yeah I
mean that's if we ever get pregnant but
I don't know if we will Neffe asked what
Disney villain would you be I mean my
initial reaction is Maleficent only
because I think she's so amazing but
that's not actually who I would be
because I'm not like that fierce and
quiet and refined feel I could probably
be like Ursula like George was
I'm gonna grab Maleficent you know
because I feel like the other ones are
just like shady assholes but like
Maleficent like she's justified like I'm
T Maleficent Mady asked where do you see
yourself in ten years with YouTube in
ten years I don't even know if I'll be
doing youtube I have no way I would know
if I'll be alive ten years I mean I'm
always thinking about the fact that like
there's always something new and better
and brighter there's always upcoming
stars like that's just how it is
uhm I'm gonna work my ass off to do the
best I can with everything with my
youtube channel my subscribers with
everything else that I'm working on my
upcoming projects and everything but I
mean it's only a matter of time I feel
until someone else comes out with
something that's even better than
YouTube like I feel like they're
probably working on it right now as we
speak something that they're planning to
like eat YouTube and take it over you
know and it's like when Google Google
like runs this world who knows what's up
their sleeve next I don't know I mean
honestly it's dive into my power like I
can wake up tomorrow morning and my
youtube channel could be shutting down
like YouTube could crash and everything
could be gone which is like I'm not
gonna have nightmares about that bit
Courtney asked how do you feel about
wearing makeup to the gym beach and pool
is it bad for your skin or are there
only certain products you can wear how
do I feel about it
I don't wear makeup to the pool the
beach or the gym I mean I don't go to
the gym but I'm actually going to start
going to the gym very soon though what
scared um
I personally don't wear makeup those
places just because I feel like what's
the point I'm gonna sweat it off at all
three of those places and I'm gonna feel
disgusting and I'm like oh my face like
I don't know if you guys follow anri's
on snapchat but I swear to God that girl
goes on vacation and she's out at the
pool just like slaying and like a
hundred degree heat with her makeup just
looking perfection I'm like I'm hi teach
me your ways because that is not me it's
literally like expectations vs. reality
me at the pool or at the beach I'm like
a beached whale like sweating my ass off
like I have like a beet red face cuz I'm
so sensitive and it's like I'm sunburned
even though I'm wearing like a hundreds
like SPF it's not a good situation so I
kind of just skip makeup for the most
part unless
in a climate where it's not super duper
humid humid if I was one of the beach in
California like in the springtime when
it's like perfect at the beach like
maybe 70s and no humidity and then I
might wear some makeup but for the most
part like here in Florida it's like with
humidity like swampland and like that
face don't stand a chance girl like I
don't do it
Maddy McCool okay that's an awesome name
is Maddy McCool said she asked what has
been the most rewarding experience so
far in your makeup journey oh that one's
easy that is being able to hire my
family like to work for me and my
company and my project and everything
I'm working on absolutely hands down the
day that I got to hire my mom and have
her work for me and to be able to give
her a job to provide her a job she loves
you know and she left she loves working
for me and seeing her so happy I mean
it's been the best reward absolutely
hands-down over anything else that I've
done erica asks what lipstick or gloss
are you wearing on your snap today funny
that you shall ask I actually can't talk
about that quite yet Miriam asked one
food that you could eat every day I feel
like it'd be sushi or pasta like pasta
carbonara with bacon oh my god I'm so
hungry right now
if my sister was here right now she'd be
like fruits grapes
smash grapes liquid grapes actually wine
I I would eat one every day Oh young Z
said do you think you'll ever stop doing
YouTube videos or when probably going to
be the worst day ever that is so sweet I
mean yeah I'm gonna stop doing them at
some point I don't think I'm gonna be
like a 50 year old lady like still doing
YouTube I don't think anyone's gonna
want to watch me but I do not have like
an end date I'm not like December 27th
2017 I'm done like I have no idea when
YouTube will start to die out and when I
will start to die out it's a matter of
time you know I'm not like the bee's
knees it's not like everyone's gonna
watch me forever so I don't know you
guys but I want to do it as long as
possible and a Beth Swanson asked what
video editing software do you use and
starting I know I'm wanting to start my
own YouTube channel and don't know where
to start
I
Final Cut Pro now but I just finally
made the transition I've edited maybe
like before a month ago and it is like
four videos with Final Cut Pro but I
always went back to iMovie just because
I movie is like basic and simple and
I've always known how to use it but like
Final Cut Pro is like iMovie is like hot
older sister so I finally made the
transition and I've been using that now
so like the past four videos I think and
I'm finally starting the hang of it
Manny
totally helped me at first and now every
single 10 minutes or I'm editing I'm
googling stuff and asking questions and
watching YouTube how videos on Final Cut
Pro but I'm teaching myself and I'm
learning and I'm growing and that is
what I'm using now and I have to say
Final Cut Pro is so much better like
there's no comparison how much better it
is Mari asks do you play pokemons go no
I don't but everybody else in my life
does my husband is always playing
pokemons go and he's now been playing it
with our nieces and nephews and they're
like running around the neighborhood
playing pokemons go and I'm like what is
going on I just found out about it like
two days ago honestly I was like I'm
sorry what but it sounds like a really
awesome game and the fact that it's
getting people like off their butts and
you have to like walk around and do it I
think is super super cool it's like
bringing people together which is
awesome Menna asks do you have any tips
on how to deal with anxiety woo I have
gone back and forth back and forth back
and forth on making a video all about
anxiety depression panic attacks that
kind of stuff and I just keep telling
myself no don't do it I just like keep
psyching myself out because I think it's
a video that I could easily get worked
up about and I could easily get offended
because I know it's any one of those
videos where people are going to have
some stuff to say about it they're gonna
have some stuff to say about me and it's
like one of those areas of my life that
I'm fine with admitting that I have
anxiety I'm fine with admitting that I
deal with this stuff I'm human hello um
but I am NOT okay with people like
there's been a couple of comments I've
received in the past from people coming
at me attacking me for having anxiety
like putting me down and using that as
their weapon and it makes me so angry I
just I can't handle it so that's the
thing I mean it sucks but that's like
the one video that I'm truly afraid to
make because of what people will say
tips on dealing with anxiety there's
so many different things I have dogs
anxiety my whole life I remember
literally kicked in when I was 15 years
old I remember the day not anxiety I had
anxiety ever since I was a little girl I
remember the day that panic kicked in
like I was 15 years old and I remember
had my first panic attack and it's like
from that moment on like I was just like
screwed it was just a bad situation I've
tried everything you know um
yoga and praying and God and going to
church and essential oils and deep
breathing and taking time for myself and
honestly more than anything the number
one thing is for me is to get out of my
own head because people for the most
part me and so many people that I know
the people that I know my world in my
life that have the worst anxiety they
seem to be the most creative and the
coolest people I know but yet internally
they're like they're dying inside their
soul just ripped up and tore apart on
their insides but they look so fun and
funny and put together from the outside
but on the inside it's like miserable if
you have anxiety my number one tip to
you is to put it to good use I
understand what it's like to be glued to
your bed and so full of anxiety and
panic that you can't take a shower I've
been there I'm not even kidding
it's been bad like really bad and my tip
is to get out of your own head just get
out of it like realize that you are okay
you're going to be fine
worst case scenario what you panic so
hard that you pass out okay so pass out
go ahead pass out right here on the
floor to do it pass out like it's gonna
happen
where's Kissinger you're gonna go to a
hospital they're gonna say um you're
fine this is anxiety go home like the
worst-case scenario isn't even that
scary we're so scared of losing control
we're so scared of not being in control
but we all need to realize at the end of
the day we are in control a meteor can
hit us right now poof we could be gone
like the world could end you are not in
control and it's so scary to accept that
it's so hard but once you do that's
where freedom and happiness lies is in
the fact that you are not in control
just let go and let God I know it sounds
cheesy but just let yourself live I
could start crying talking about this
because I'm finally at a place where I
feel like yes I have control over my
mind because that's all I can control so
I tell myself I can't control the
situation but I can control how I handle
it so when I get on a plane if there's
terrible turbulence I'm like you know
what there's turbulence right now you
can't control
you're here but you can control the way
you react so calm down turn on a movie
sit back and shut your mind up and relax
because you're gonna have to go through
this and that's how I have overcome
anxiety is I've just been very hard on
myself I know it sounds mean but I am
way too hard on myself like every day of
my life my mom my sister my husband is
always telling me stop being so hard on
yourself I'm always upset with myself
I'm always coming down myself I'm always
tearing me down that's what I do best
but honestly that's what people with
anxiety do like they have a little issue
and then they're like oh my god I have
an issue oh my god it's worse and then
you make a big big baby of it and it
takes over your entire being and it's
like just let it go just let it go
so what if you have that issue everyone
has issues when you're walking down the
street there are people all around you
to have the exact same issues as you
just let your mind go let it come to
peace let it be peace do something you
love find something to do with your
hands if it's makeup do makeup if it's
drawing or painting or sketching do
something with your hands start
organizing do something to keep your
hands busy and as you're looking at your
hands busy now your mind will get busy
thinking about what your hands are doing
and not so focused on stuff that you're
creating so wow that just went wrong
to another level but yeah I mean I've I
struggled with it very hard so if you
shovel anxiety hard I'm not gonna say
look at me now I'm amazing because I'm
like I still have work to do in all
aspects of my life Hummer um but I'm
just saying like I'm not kidding there
was a time where basically for six
months I did not get out of my bed
that's before I did YouTube but I'm not
joking like there was a print of my body
in me and Jon's mattress because I did
not get out of bed my panic was so bad I
couldn't breathe I had cold sweats all
the time like I would burn up and I get
freezing and I would think like oh I'm
sick could need to go to a hospital
nothing but anxiety like it was cool it
was ridiculous but like my life is
nothing like that now like I have
overcome it and if I can overcome it you
can because there's nothing special
about me that you don't have within you
so you got this Sierra Garcia asked
peanut butter and jelly sandwich or
grilled cheese grilled cheese for sure
but it's hard because peanut butter and
jelly sandwich with Cheetos are
Oh Lord like I don't know why I just
like remind me my childhood like mmm
give me that Jif peanut butter yes with
that Smuckers grape jelly oh my god and
then I take the Cheetos and I put them
in the PB&amp;amp;J hmm am i a weirdo for doing
that is there anyone else that puts
their chips in their sandwiches because
John has seen me eat a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich before and I stick my
Cheetos in the sandwich he's like that's
disgusting and I'm like you're
disgusting this is amazing um but I
actually choose grilled cheese because
the fact that my mom has taught me how
to make the most amazing grilled cheese
in the entire world like it is so bomb
um it used to be like my mom's thing
like all my friends would come over in
high school for my mom's girl too that
they call big hey I'm coming over for
your mom's grilled cheese like we've
always said that she needs to open up
like a grilled cheese place like a
restaurant that's just nothing but her
grilled cheeses like I swear I'm like
mom you have a line around the block for
your grilled cheese

what Disney movie and food item would

fruit roll-up for sure because my mom
never let me ever roll ups my mom was
like that mean annoying mom that
wouldn't let like junk food into the
house like it was such special occasion
if there was like soda in the house
would be such a big deal so I would
definitely have a fruit roll-up and I
would watch Beauty and the Beast cuz
Mutina beasts is my favorite Disney

Haley asks how bad the lip injections
hurt so it's interesting because first
of all there's numbing cream put on and
I'm like honey load me up like they put
the numbing cream on and actually made
the tip of my tongue numb because it
like seeped through and got my tongue
numb which was a really weird sensation
but I've heard other people say that
they've actually talked too much and
gotten it in their throat and their
throat it's not and I'm like oh my god
I'm so scared of that but anyway so your
numbed and it hurts in certain places
but in others it doesn't so like on the
outer side of the lip it doesn't hurt
that much at all like I actually got
them touched up two days ago which is
why they're swollen right now if you can
tell what they're swollen here and there
you're a little swollen but anyways so I
got them touched up and when she put the
needle here on the side I literally did
not feel one thing I'm not being
dramatic I didn't feel anything it just
felt like this I felt nothing I was
talking to her when the needle was in my
lip I was in wait it's in my lip right
now she was like yes it's currently in
your little zit oh my god I feel nothing
but when they do the top lip that's when
it hurts and it's not even like a level
10 pain it makes me do this every time
it hurts I go mmm
that's my reaction it's just one of
those pains we were like huh but it's
not like a like it's not a pain where
you're feeling like miserable she's like
a sting and the guy and it goes away the
second they take the needle out and the
needle is only in there for a couple
seconds so it's not good to live with
that pain forever
Nikki asked what did you spend your
first YouTube paycheck on groceries I
remember that moment perfectly I got
paid I got my check in the mail from
YouTube and I jumped on John's back and
he started like running around the house
he on his piggy back and I was going
back with the check in my hand and we
literally got straight in our car and we
drove to Publix and we spent every penny
of that check on groceries and that is
what our first check went to very
exciting makeup and cocktails asked why
haven't you moved to California why
Florida there's several different
reasons and I noticed this is the main
reason but I'm terrified of earthquakes
I was so scared when I was in California
last time the night before I left at
like 1:30 in the morning there was a
baby earthquake and the chandeliers she
like were shaking
and the like the ground felt like it
kind of just did like this little roll
and I'm not kidding I almost passed out
I literally was like I thought I was
truly going to faint like everyone was
dying laughing at me cuz they're like oh
my god we almost lost Jacko there for a
minute I'm terrified but that's not the
reason why the reason why I don't live
in California even though it would be
better for my business is because
business and money and my brand and what
I'm working on is never as important to
me as me my life my family and I have my
brother and his family here and then my
brother's wife we have her mother here
we have all their kids here we have my
mom and we have my sister now who just
moved down here with her husband and
their kids so this store my family is so
I'm not gonna pack up and leave like
this is where we are here I just I get
to leave like my humble life with my
family and it's just quiet out here and
for us so that's that's why I stay here
