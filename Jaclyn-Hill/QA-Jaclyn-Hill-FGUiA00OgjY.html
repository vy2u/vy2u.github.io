question and answer video this is an
extremely requested video on my channel
and I posted a photo on Instagram and
sent out a tweet telling you guys I was
gonna film this for you and I got so
many questions from you guys and I
actually went through and read every
single one of them and narrowed them
down to all the most popular questions
and I made notes of them on my phone and
I have a lot of questions so I'm going
to try to get through them as quickly as
possible so here we go a lot of you guys
have tons of questions about me and my
husband our marriage when we got married
so on and so forth so I'm just going to
cover that first the first question is
how did you and John meet John is my
husband by the way so that's what I'm
gonna call him
um we actually met because he was the
drummer and my ex-boyfriends band so
yeah that's how I met him and how did he
propose to you he proposed to me on the
4th of July during the grand finale of
the fireworks he was actually so nervous
that he got down on both knees to
propose to me yes as if he was about to
worship me both nice it was adorable
okay what was your first impression of
him um that he was extremely hot yes
that is extremely shallow but that was
my first impression when I first saw him
I was just like oh my god and that was
my first impression how old were you
when you got married I was 19 years old
yes I'm sure a bunch of you are gasping
right now it is what it is we were nine
I was 19 he was 21 its he supportive of
your career choice yes he is extremely
supportive of my career choice he loves
what I do
he thinks it's awesome just as I am as
supportive as him and his dreams and
what he chooses to do very much so what
are things that he does that drives me
nuts um that depends what day you ask me
um time of day week maybe I should say
the time of month more importantly um
some days just breathing drives me crazy
other days I'm like oh
he's my prince charming he can do no
wrong so I mean overall he's really
messy though so um I'm messy too but I'm
not dirty like he's dirty i I like leave
clothes around and like my makeup will
be left around and I'll come back and
pick it up later I'm messy but like he's
dirty like he's just such a guy and it's
okay anyways but overall that's probably
the thing that drives me nuts the most
okay moving on are you still working for
Mac no I am not working for Mac anymore
and I find it crazy that so many of you
caught on so quickly um I put in my two
weeks notice right before I left for
Chicago it's a very long story but I was
at the company for four years and maybe
even a little more than four years
anyways I was just I just I was done and
I got so much i working for mac and i
felt like i really couldn't get any more
from what they already gave me so it was
100% my choice I am extremely happy with
my decision so no I am no longer working
for mac cosmetics pros and cons of
working for Mac um the pro I would say
is that I learned so much working for
them especially when I was up north
working in Chicago we had the most
amazing workshops it was non-stop I mean
we were constantly learning new things
new trends new ways to utilize old
products that we've been using forever I
mean it was so much fun we were just
constantly learning if you are an
aspiring makeup artist and you have you
know the chance to work for a Mac up
north I would say grab at it grab it as
soon as you can because they teach you
so much up there and it was so much fun
I also got all my certifications through
them and I also was product specialist
for a while with Mac so they definitely
taught me a lot and I was able to get a
lot from them so cons I would say though
is that I have to sell I know that
sounds really silly but it was not easy
for me um I'm not a sales person
and I do not like going to work and
having my manager tell me like hey today
you need to sell 10 of our new mascara
um because everyone coming in might not
be looking for mascara and I don't like
trying to push things down people's
throats that they don't want That's not
me I just want to do makeup I want to
give you what you need for you
specifically and treat you as an
individual and become friends with you I
don't want to sell to you so that was
hard for me in general just having to
sell to people I was very uncomfortable
with it um but you know it is what it is
how did you become a makeup artist that
is a hard question because I have been
interested in makeup my whole life um
ever since I was a little girl I would
take my mom and my sisters products if
they didn't like anymore or that they
didn't use or things that were old they
wanted to get rid of because it was
almost gone I would take it store in a
drawer under my my um vanity like in my
bathroom now we play with makeup all the
time I would steal my sisters products
and play with them all the time I was
obsessed with makeup and then I just
kind of got a knack for as I got older I
played with it every day and I just
started doing my friends makeup for
special events and occasions and just
for fun I would just do the makeup and
take pictures of them just because I
loved it
so yeah I just I've always had a thing
for makeup if you weren't doing makeup
for a living what would you be doing
probably photography because that's what
I went to school for and that's the next
question on here is what did I go to
school for um I would just go for
photography and while I was there I
realized I liked doing the models makeup
more than I liked taking the actual
photographs and it became a thing where
everyone on campus who was also in
school for photography was always asking
you to come do their models makeup and I
was always doing makeup I was doing
makeup more than I was concentrating on
doing my photography and it was just
like hey I like doing this a lot more so
if I wasn't in this for makeup um I
would probably be doing something like
photography something in the creative
world because I am not good at anything
else other than creativity like I could
be a doctor or a scientist or an
architect like
That's not me I have to do something
where I'm being able to use my
creativity why did you start YouTube I
started YouTube because when I was
leaving the Chicago store so many of my
regular customers that would come in and
get their makeup done by me all the time
for fun and just to try new products and
they would come meet to me back and
forth for events and things like that
they were so sad when I was leaving and
they were always asking me all of them
to you know make videos on YouTube so
they could keep up with me even though I
was moving across the United States
because they wanted to continue to learn
things I was doing so after having so
many people encouraged me to do it and
then me talking to my family and friends
about it and then saying the same thing
I was just like okay let's do it and
Here I am do you do airbrush I own an
airbrush machine I own the foundations
um I do not I do not offer it to my
clients I don't recommend it especially
for just like Bridal or prom glamour
makeup which is what ninety percent of
people want I don't think that it's all
that it's cracked up to be I think you
can get just as beautiful of a look if
not even more beautiful using a brush
and foundation and doing it manually
airbrush I think is really important
when you're doing things on the body I
personally find that if you're like you
know sculpting the ABS or contouring and
highlighting the body then that airbrush
is necessary but for just the everyday
glamorous look I don't think airbrush is
necessary that's just my opinion though
okay favorite drugstore brand my hair
drugstore brand overall would have to be
L'Oreal um I have favorite brands for
favorite products like my favorite lip
products are by Maybelline but overall I
think L'Oreal is the best they have
great eyeliner great mascara they're my
favorite foundation great pigmented
eyeshadows L'Oreal's eyeshadows are
actually the same eyeshadow is armani
there are the same packaging with
different lettering on it they're the
exact same product made in the same
manufacturer
lore'l I think is amazing I think even
down to like their hair products I love
L'Oreal I think they're great so for
sure Lauria
how do you prevent cake face and this is
referring to and your foundation cakes
up but it looks like frosting and it's
just like oh my god you look better
without any foundation whatsoever um a
trick that you can do is when you get
them applying your foundation take a
clean and clean tissue and just Pat your
face and just literally just like smush
it against your face especially over any
little lines that you get like in
between eyebrows the forehead the lip
area push the tissue and that will soak
up the excess foundation that is just
sitting on your skin and the excess oil
so that doesn't move and just sit in
those lines so that's a really easy
trick tell us something that we don't
know about you um I was home-schooled
all through middle school in high school
I did not have a normal teenage
experience whatsoever I was pulled out
of going to regular school because my
family and I traveled all around the
world to third world countries
to donate clothes and toys and food and
water to orphanages and I've been to
Africa like nine times I've been to
India we used went all over the place
just to help people and just give them
hugs and tell them that they're
important and that they're loved and
that they mean something um so yeah
that's something you kinda know about me
I also graduated right when I turned 16
because I was home-schooled I hated
school I wanted to get through it as
quickly as possible so yeah my teenage
years were very different and because of
that I was very bullied growing up um
very bullied like the kids my age just
did not like me I didn't fit into any
mold I was different and creative and I
had a few really good friends and
outside of that people just don't like
me but I am very happy and thankful that
that experience happened to me and not
someone else because I have the
personality and the strength to deal
with things like that so I'm very
thankful that God dealt me those cards
and not someone else who would just
crumble because I
and it wasn't it wasn't that hard for me
um obviously the bowling stops to all of
you who get bullied in high school it
will stop when you get older and you
find your knack in life it will stop
like it will what are you passionate
about outside of makeup
um this is getting heavy but I would
have to say my true passion outside of
makeup is to stop human trafficking I
know that's really intense and I'm
sharing a lot with you right now about
myself but my heart beats for those
women and children and men who don't
have a choice in their life and are
being abused and their bodies are being
sold I mean I have spent hours and days
just in my bed crying because it just
breaks my heart so much that these
people don't have a choice how they can
live their life I mean it kills me
inside there was anything that I could
just snap my fingers and then go away it
would be human trafficking it just it's
it puts a huge huge huge hole in my
chest do you have any tattoos or
piercings I don't have tattoos I wish
that I could I wish I had the guts to
get tattoos I think that they're really
cool if they're on the right person um
when I see a 60 year old woman walking
around on the beach with tattoos I'm
just like nope not for me
um I look at my mother and my mother is
so beautiful and she's so awesome and
she's such a role model of mine and
she's taking such great care of her body
and when I envisioned her with a tattoo
I'm just like no no I don't want I don't
want to have a tattoo um if they were
they only lasted for five or ten years I
would totally get them but I don't have
any as for piercings I have my lip
pierced got that done when I was 15 my
sister acted like she was my mom and
signed a consent form I have my nose
pierced and I have two piercings in my
ears and that's it no other piercings
how do you deal with mean comments and
hate um I really don't care I guess I
just um yeah I mean I guess to me it's
like if you're being mean to me or
you're leaving hate comments to me it
just
I'm like okay it's obviously not me that
is making you feel this way something
that I have learned is especially here
with what I'm doing
tightly main comments on the Internet is
just an outlet for people to express
themselves where they don't have to have
any fingers pointed at them they're
behind the computer I don't know who
they are they might have gotten fired or
had a bad day at work or it could be
going through a divorce or a breakup or
they owe rent that they can't pay and
they see me and my foundation is too
yellow for them and it just pushes them
over the edge and they leave a mean
comment and so you know it just doesn't
really bother me because everyone has
their own thing and if you're gonna
leave me in comments or hate comments to
me I know that it is not a direct attack
to me I know that there's something in
your life
that is upsetting you and bothering you
and you are unhappy with what's going on
around you and that is why you have that
hate in your heart because you don't
know me that well so you cannot hate me
so moving on what is your favorite
perfume anything by Marc Jacobs I love
Marc Jacobs um I used to be obsessed
with Prada candy but now I Justin kind
of grossed out by the smells I wore it
so much am I like really light fresh
sense like dolce gabbana light blue I
like Marc Jacobs dot Marc Jacobs Daisy
just anything fresh it smells like
spring I don't like really warm like
amber sense I don't like anything musky
I like it just to be like ah as you can
tell I wound a little tight and I like
sense that just mmm anything like lemon
just citrus oh yes but will you ever go
blonde again yes I will I will go blonde
again when my hair is really really long
I have intentions of going blonde again
but until then gonna just stick to what
I have but one day I will definitely go
blonde again what is your ethnicity I
two mains our French French and German I
believe okay yeah wow really like I
forget I'm such a mutt will you be my
friend I thought this is the cutest
question ever yes I will be your friend
are you kidding me look at what I'm
doing I'm putting myself
therefore you be my friend like I
thought that was the most adorable thing
ever the in all these comments and
scrolling scrolling scrolling and
someone just asked will you be my friend
yes I'll be your friend we can go
shopping we can drink coffee we'll be
friends who was your first celebrity
crush okay so as far as I can remember
I'm sure there were once and I was a
little girl but Tom DeLonge from blink
182 oh my gosh I can only remember doing
this I was so obsessed with blink 182
like on every CD poster all over my wall
to the death blink 182 I was obsessed
with Tom DeLonge I thought they were
just the coolest guy in the entire role
oh my gosh what is your favorite food
that is a hard one
umm that is a tie between Chicago style
pizza sushi and Mexican oh those sounds
so gross when they're all put together
in the same sentence but yeah only
Chicago style pizza though I like all
pizza but Chicago style is just like oh
I can't get enough luminaries Pizza is
where it's I cannot get enough and sushi
and Mexican food yes yes yes where were
you born
I was born on a farm in Illinois yes
farm girl would you ever been guests
whenever I tell people that thoroughly
like wait what yeah I was born on a farm
live there for a while wore overalls it
was actually a pig farm my dad was a pig
farmer we had corn and beans and yeah
born on a farm in Illinois why don't you
answer your fans questions when I saw
this I had to address it because that
like really hurts that people are
leaving me questions and I'm not being
able to answer them because when I
upload a video I sit in front of my
computer for at least two hours and just
answer questions and I'm constantly on
my Instagram answering questions I mean
like when my husband is driving me
places I'm answering questions I'm
shopping I'm answering questions I'm
getting my hair done I'm answering
questions so it really sucks that so
many of you are trying to ask me
questions and I haven't answered them um
I will say the hardest place to answer
questions is the messages I deal
Facebook is very hard because I get so
many messages on there that it like labs
and it takes forever to open them
because so many come in so you want to
ask me a question I would say to avoid
asking me few messages on Facebook
because I've pretty much given up
because it takes forever um
Twitter Instagram and YouTube are the
main places where I answer questions the
fastest alright favorite color that's
another hard one I don't know my
favorite color my favorite color to work
with on makeup it's warm colors like
oranges and anything with a red base
amber gold like I love working with warm
colors and makeup my favorite color to
wear is probably neutrals my favorite
color to decorate is neutrals see that's
hard to ask someone who is doing makeup
what their favorite color is because
it's like everything I love every color
I just I love color I love color I don't
know what to say about that okay the
last question is my favorite TV show my
favorite TV show at the moment is Modern
Family um my husband I just went out and
bought a couple seasons of them and
we're obsessed we watch them every
single night before we go to bed I'm
obsessed with Modern Family
if Modern Family isn't for you no
judgement but I can't get enough before
modern family I would have to say was
friends I was obsessed with friends for
years I own every single season and even
though it's been done forever
me and my husband still watch friends on
a weekly basis even though I've seen
every single episode probably not
kidding 50 times um I just love the cast
I love friends it's so light-hearted
it's so funny I love it so yeah modern
family and friends for sure so yes that
is our whole question to answer video I
hope that I got to the majority of the
questions I tried to compile them all
together so I kind of touch base on
everything you guys were asking so yeah
we're done and I'm going out of town on
business this weekend but I will be back
at the beginning of early next week so I
will see you soon
mmm bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
