question and answer I was like what is
this called I may be doing a question
answer video for you guys say and I'm
super excited be doing this because I
realized yesterday I have not done a Q&amp;amp;A
on my channel I'm like looking it up
right now on YouTube hold on it's been
over a year since I've done a Q&amp;amp;A which
is way too long I think I only had like
a hundred thousand subscribers or
something when I did my last Q&amp;amp;A that's
actually the only one I've ever done
so today's Q&amp;amp;A is going to be a little
bit more of a personal one tons of you
guys were asking me personal questions
about my life and my family and that
kind of stuff so that's what today is
going to be and then I figured in a
couple of weeks maybe like a month or so
from now we can do a makeup Q&amp;amp;A where
it's just strictly makeup base you guys
can ask me advice or whatever is it's
going on you guys can ask me so I
thought that that would kind of make
sense no I'm saying that way this can be
personal the next one can be makeup does
that make sense let me know how you feel
about that and then I also thought
because so many of you have been asking
to like hear my story if you will of how
I became you know a makeup artist in
general or got a job at Mac or you know
fell into the industry whatever it may
be so I'm kind of thinking of making an
entire video just kind of how I got
started as a makeup artist in the
industry what I did kind of tips that
could maybe help you guys if you guys
want to see a full dedicated video to
that let me know in the comments down
below let tweet me whatever it is just
let me know somehow through some outlet
and I will totally make a video on that
as well so today is gonna be a question
and answer I have screenshotted so many
questions on Twitter oh my gosh is
insane but it's funny because a lot of
the questions are very similar like for
the most part everyone almost asks the
same questions just worded differently
so I'm kind of going to take like a
really popular ones and hit those got
you the number one question oh my god
that I got tweeted about I've got
hundreds and you guys asking this is
when an if John and I are planning on
having children so to answer that
question I have talked about this before
and so if you've been around for a long
time you're gonna the answer to this I
do not have the desire to have children
I love children I love babies so much
and every time I see a baby or a smell
baby listen
okay or I pull the baby I'm like oh my
god and I do have four nieces and
nephews in my family and the youngest of
them right now is four years old so the
babies are gone it kind of sucks some so
used to having infants and babies around
my family and I'm like wait I want
another baby to hang out with but I'm
not ready for my own like I'm only 24
years old everyone thinks I'm older than
that I'm only 24 John is 3 years older
than me and I'm just I'm not there and
honestly I don't feel the pressure from
the world to have kids like I feel like
everyone is trying to put on me when
John I got married it was like everyone
like someone you had any kids
and we're like Hello look our lives if
we can't even afford rent do you think
we're gonna have a baby right now like
that's responsible what is your biggest
pet peeve oh gosh let me think um was my
big feet um if you'd have asked me this
four years ago I would say bra straps
I know it's still random but like if a
shirt like this if you're wearing it and
you're writing normal bra you can see
your bra straps that still kind of
drives me crazy but not as much as it
used to it used to be like like it would
like pick at my skin now I would have to
say being late or if someone else makes
me late Oh
like if I'm ready and on time and
someone that I'm like going somewhere
with they're driving and they're late
picking me up I'm just in the car like
look I can't stand being late I'm very
punctual so I have to say that's like my
number one pet peeve what shows are you
currently watching on Netflix
hello friends has been on repeat repeat
repeat since January first of course I
mean I've walked the show like pretty
much every week - every month since the
show ended like ten years ago but since
it's on Netflix now it's so easy I don't
like change out DVDs so it's like on my
TV constantly I'm not gonna lie it was
on this computer five seconds before I
started recording so friends all the
time what age did you start wearing
makeup well I mean like I don't really
know what exact age I would put on that
because I've worn makeup since I was
like a wee little taught me I to a
pigsty I have worn makeup because my
sister is seven years older than me and
my mom she's always been like glamazon
so I've always played with makeup and
always wore makeup but my mom really let
me express myself at a young age
have pictures like a family Christmas
card where I'm wearing dark purple
lipstick and I'm like seven or eight
years old like my mom just like just let
her do her thing so I don't know how she
did that because I feel like if I had a
daughter a big you are not thinking that
house to be like that but my mom let me
make a fool of myself all the time so I
can't think of like an exact age will
you be launching your own makeup line
soon hmm
I just don't know Netflix or shopping
both I'm not a big shopper like going
out shopping I'm not that big I prefer
online shopping anyway so like hello
best of both worlds well actually best
in all worlds Netflix shopping pajama
pants or no pants and I scream like I'm
sorry but life doesn't get better than
that do you think you would survive a
zombie apocalypse hell yes I so think I
could survive a zombie apocalypse like I
watch these movies and I'm like everyone
is like I'm already high strong I'm
already to anxiety-ridden and so
anything bad happens and my adrenaline
kicks in and I'm like I swear I'm like
that woman who like flips a car when my
adrenaline takes over so I totally think
that I could survive for sure I'd be
saving all my friends and family my
brother would survive - he's totally a
survivor
you go Glen Coco when you were younger
what was your dream job hello to be
Britney Spears what would you be doing
if you never discovered YouTube I would
be doing the exact same thing that I'm
doing right now it is not on YouTube
when I started YouTube I was on my
fourth year at MAC Cosmetics and I was
currently a product specialist with the
company so I was moving upward you know
and my freelance business had just
started getting much busier as you know
YouTube started becoming something and
at that time I thought like that's what
I was gonna do with my life I wanted to
start my own business in a Tampa Bay
area I wanted to hire employees I wanted
to write down space like that's what I
wanted at that moment but then God had
other plans for me and that never
happened but I am so blessed that my
life did go a different direction
but that was my plan and if YouTube were
to shut down today that's exactly what I
would do how do you and John work
through fights if you have them okay I
love this she says if you have them no
we don't fight
like we just wake up in the morning and
it's hugs and kisses and rainbows all
day and we just look at each other and
we smile no no yes John I definitely
fight um I pretty much scream until he
sees my side and then we move on I'm
just kidding
what's the cutest thing that John does
or has done for you mmm oh my god I know
when we were first married I was sick
with the like I had a stomach flu and I
had a really bad head cold and I was
laying in bed like miserable and I was
like I need more cold medicine so he's
like okay let me go get it for you so he
goes to the kitchen and a few minutes
later all of a sudden he right mmm mmm
and I'm like what is that I look over
the side of my bed and he hasn't one of
his remote-control cars and it's like
banging against the bed and I'm like
what yes my husband has remote-control
cars
listen he's a little boy at heart I love
him for it is where this and I'm like oh
my god what is that I look down and on
top of the remote-control car is the day
cool medicine and then a little note and
I'm like stop and I pick it up and the
note was so cute it was a such a quick
note that he'd written but it was like a
sweet little love note and I look around
the corner and I can I barely see his
head he's like looking at the remote
like okay the cart controlling it oh my
god are you
hila keone how old were you and your
husband when you guys met um I was
either no I was 15 I just turned 15 and
John was probably just bout to turn 18
when we just met that's not when we
started dating we knew each other for
years before we started dating I was
actually I had a boyfriend we met and he
had a girlfriend and he came over to my
house with one of his friends and I was
laying on my couch watching Willy Wonka
he walked in a like who the hell is this
up in my house hello let me get a mirror
what is your favorite restaurant in
Tampa oh I love food so much so I was
going to go to restaurants but um I
don't have to say that's if you guys
come to the Tampa area go to - it's
always always busy no matter what day
what time of day you go but it's a great
Tampa restaurant and it's just like it's
Tampa you know it's in the middle of the
hunt our South Tampa and it's a good
Tampa restaurant also yeah I mean their
Bloody Mary's are so good I hate Bloody
Marys but they have bacon in there
so what motivates you to be such a
positive person I don't like myself when
I'm negative
like if I was having a negative day like
some days I'll wake up and it's like oh
I feel like grabbing in a Slayton I
don't describe myself complaining all
day at the end of that day I feel
exhausted and I just feel gross just
like dirty like oh I need to look at
myself in the mirror and force myself to
smile you just don't feel good when
you're being negative so that's all
mostly my motivation is I just want to
feel good I want to be happy so I'm
gonna smile I'm gonna dance until I feel
happy do you ever drink alcohol I've
never seen you post about clubs or bars
or wine or anything I'm just curious a
lot of you guys actually ask me this
question if I go clubbing if I drink
that kind of thing and I don't go
clubbing I haven't been to a club since
I was 19
yeah and even then I didn't drink
because I was 19
um but no I'm just not I'm not like a
party girl
and it's funny because everyone thinks I
am what everyone needs me they're like
hey let's go to the club and I'm like
let's go to the couch if I have a night
off I'll stay on the couch and catch up
on my shows and drink a glass of wine
you know I'm saying telling you I get
the old lady award for youtube right
what are your best coping methods for
anxiety and then she said so proud of
you for putting yourself out there oh so
sweet um yes I have anxiety I I don't
talk about it that often because like
who wants to talk about their anxiety
and their problems if your anxiety you
know exactly I'm talking about um yeah I
have anxiety big-time and I've gone
through therapy for it and I've done
like natural remedies for it and I have
I've done a lot for my anxiety it's a
lot better it used to be I used to
struggle with very severe panic attacks
which were horrible
they were crippling I wasn't like able
to do anything in life because I would
panic so hard but my best coping methods
for anxiety honestly like this is
something I learned about a year ago is
it I will start to have anxiety about
something I'll be what's the worst it's
going to happen right now and I'll just
get serious with myself and I think
right now if you're gonna freak out and
if you're gonna be I can't do this
you're gonna get and you're gonna run
away what's going to happen
like what's the worst and I'll tell
myself the worst I think the worst
things going
and you're gonna get yourself so worked
up you're gonna start crying you're
going to feel nauseous you're gonna pass
out whatever it may be that's gonna be
the worst case scenario and I'm like
okay well I have control over that and
I'm not going with myself get there and
that kind of works for me like anytime I
get in front of a big group of people
I'm like I'm gonna pass out like every
time I'm like oh my god where do I hit
the floor right now
but then I'll ask my something okay what
if what if you hit the floor you pass
out you wake back up you're fine you're
still alive your heart's still beating
you're still healthy like I remind
myself that just that for some reason
helps me to cope with anxiety too big
get over yourself Jacqueline get over
yourself because I feel like people with
anxiety are so in tune with themselves
and that's what I hate about it is I
hate that when I get anxiety it's like I
can't even focus on anyone around me I'm
like so selfish it's like all about me
and my anxiety and I hate that so I'll
big knock it off get out of yourself
think about something else other than
you Jacqueline so maybe it's a little
tough love you guys are probably hoping
for me to be like you know what I just
take a bath no I'm like bitch handle it
I deal pizza thin crust extra cheese oh
my god this crashed it first time you f
first time you blank in front of your
husband I don't use that F word not that
one cuz I mom raised me that that's such
an ugly word so we say like pass gas
even that's like awkward so I got on
camera um the answer to that is I never
have okay that's right you proud of your
girl never have it's so funny because I
think I haven't done that in front my
husband I never will like she doesn't
care of course not like it doesn't
matter but for him but me no more ever
but it's so funny because like anything
else is totally acceptable like I could
have like a gross like growing on
the worst part
my body and I like John come help me
with this
but that oh my god I'm really nervous to
talk about this subject but I'm going to
because so many of you guys have asked
me and it's about my dad I got probably
75 to 100 tweets of you guys asking if I
have contact with my father what
happened to my dad where is he at why
don't I mention him whatever it may be
just in general I got questions on my
dad so someone asked by contact my
father and no I don't have contact with
him at all in any way whatsoever I don't
have contact with him um my parents okay
have said they went through a divorce a
really horrible ugly nasty divorce years
ago um the divorce was finalized
when was it finalized I feel like it was
like three years ago maybe two and a
half years ago the divorce was finalized
and I had not talked to him since I've
talked to him in like two and half three
years so um that's one I have like a
couple subjects of things I've gone
through the past few years that are
extremely touchy and that's one of them
like I have a very very big heart now
though for people who go through
horrible divorces for people who you
know are stolen from or taken from
people who have like lost their father
whether it's to death whether it's a
divorce would no matter what it is like
it's giving me a really huge heart um
for those type of people because I never
in a million years thought that I would
lose my dad I never in a million years
thought that my parents would get a
divorce I felt so bad for every one of
my friends who had divorced parents I
just felt like oh my god that's so
heartbreaking that like their parents on
the two different homes now like I never
thought that would be me um so my
parents divorce was definitely humbling
um brought me down to earth but showed
me what a queen my mom was and showed me
what a mmm my father was so yeah I don't
have contact with him none of us do it
sucks because he was definitely my hero
oh my god I'm not going to cry but we
were very very close we would all call
our family the dream team because we
were all so close growing up and I'm so
thankful for that my dad was my very
best friend we have a lot of
similarities um yeah so extremely
extremely close so to have him do what
he did and kind of turn him up turn on
us and the divorce was just it was
heartbreaking so it sucks it's a really
sense of something pretty sucks and he's
no longer around so that's that what are
your thoughts in the lime crime scandal
I don't get into this too much because
I'll be sitting there talking for 45
minutes Google I'm Google the lime car
google the lime crime scandal if you
guys are interested my thoughts on it I
have made it clear on Twitter and I
posted a little snapchat video I'll link
my snapchat down below because I know a
lot you guys have asked what it is um no
I'm not about that life I think that
it's complete BS and I will no longer be
purchasing from Lime Crime again and I'm
done with them so that's my opinion you
probably get this one a lot of how to do
your husband meet the first time I ever
met him was through a mutual friend he
walked into my house and I saw him and
there he was standing beautifully but I
actually became like closer with him and
like friends with him because he was
actually the drummer in my boyfriend's
band at the time and I was a
photographer like I went to photography
school later and so I would take
pictures and like ban promos for the
band and my boyfriend would always be
like why are there so many pictures of
John here I did it drugs just really
intrigued me
who was your favorite youtuber so
anything we'll ask me this and you can't
ask me to decide that I have so many
friends here on YouTube so like of
course me to say my friends you know
Alex faction pk
have you guys PK is not like in the
beauty community but he has with my
favorite channels on YouTube he does
videos that I just absolute love him
I'll put his link down below so you guys
can check out PK because you'll fall in
love him and want him to be your best
friend too
you guys can't make me pick a favorite
like there's no way ever stuck on an
island and you can only bring to makeup
items what would they be and why mm erst
of all can I trade in the makeup items
for food I would do mascara and
illuminizer
because that way my eyes could pop a
little bit and I could be real nice and
glowy because we know we got that hand
going on so now I got a highlight it of
course what is your favorite kind of
alcohol
drink um my number one just like
favorite go-to drink is white wine
I like Savion Blanc because it's just
like citrusy and fruity and yummy and I
drink Kim Crawford which is my favorite
brand of Swabia Blanc um but I like wine
because it kind of brings me down and
mellows me out and that's what I'm
looking for I love like a mojito I like
fresh things I like things that are like
fresh and berries and lights you know
I'm saying what is your favorite part
about being an adult and if you could go
back and be a kid again would you no I
would not go back to being a kid again
even though I actually loved my
childhood things are so good when you're
a kid everything's so simple you don't
like get the reality of life and it's so
amazing you're so ignorant and it's so
blissful and I love it so much but you
know we gotta be a big kid at some point
so I wouldn't go back but my favorite
part about being an adult is my
independence because my dad was very
controlling and I couldn't do anything
when I was younger like I was 15 years
old and I go to my dad and they hey guy
and I go to the movies tonight with my
friend and he didn't um and II oh why
not
I I've done everything this week I've
done all my chores my room is clean I
did all my school I might ask me because
I said so
okay okay so I guess I'll just sit here
and scratch my ass with the rest of the
night like a homeschool double freak I
love being an adult because I have my
independence and it's like I can go see
it moving the middle of the day if I
want to bitch would you ever get a cat
or another dog I would never get a cat I
am NOT a cat person I am NOT on this
like cat lady grind whatsoever cats hate
me and you might think like no no no
yeah cats hate you real funny and I'm
not kidding cats hate me all my friends
who have cats I told them listen your
cat's gonna eat me and they're like no
never not my cat my cat loved you my cat
loves everybody and I walk in their
house and their cats like
and like I've never seen her do that rhe
cat hates me so I don't do the whole cat
thing um another dog John really wants
another dog I just don't know if you
guys have two dogs let me know if you
guys love it if you think one dog is
better than two dogs
Georgie loves to play and he loves be
around other dogs but he's like so hyper
so often I'm scared he'll terrorize a
puppy so I don't know what I don't know
embarrassing habit when it comes to
shopping oh my gosh it's such a random
question okay who asked me that Kristin
Franklin that is this such a random
question to ask an embarrassing habit
when it comes to shopping but I actually
have one and it's when I go shopping
ever sells a little girl when I try on
an outfit that I really really like I
start to dance and I don't just dancing
I dance hard you know what I'm gonna
call my mom
and I'm gonna have her tell you because
she'll she'll back me up hey hey
moo-ha-ha I am filming right now and
you're on camera you're okay so I need
you to back me up I'm filming a question
and answer video right now and someone I
can't this is the most random question
do you have an embarrassing habit when
it comes to shopping and it's so funny
they ask that because I already told the
camera what it was but I'm calling you
for you to back me up and tell the
camera if there's something that I've
done my whole life when I try out an
outfit and shopping oh yeah it started
when you were a little girl you were
really little if I had you try on
something that you can like you would
stand for a mirror and wouldn't move and
they would just make like this disgusted
face but then when you put on an outfit
that you loved you would always dance is
very sir
hopping around and dancing and twirling
it Snickers yes winner of all we have a
winner
told you all right well thanks mommy
mommy
I'll see you later okay
all-time favorite movie if I had to look
if I could watch one movie for like the
next month it would be Mean Girls that
one will never die so I guess I'll go
with me girls because I definitely like
quote Mean Girls every single day of my
life and I have for 10 years how do you
usually spend your lazy days um I don't
do many activities like a lot of people
who like have a day off so they uh I
went for a hike and then I've grabbed a
green juice and then I went on a 16 mile
walk and I'm like are you kidding me
love to go to the movie theater there's
a good movie out I go to the movies
probably twice a month with my husband
or my mom or whoever my friends I love
going to the movies I love organizing my
house I know that that's like really
most people don't enjoy that but I do I
find it helps my anxiety it like clears
out my mind I feel like if I have a
clear space I can like oh I'd have like
peace and clarity so I like organizing
things and moving things around and
stuff like that so that's typically the
kind of SEP I do on lazy days my phone
is 6% so I have to plug it in the
biggest misconception about me would
definitely have to be I am conceited
cocky stuck-up whatever term you want to
use um I get that pretty often you know
like I've changed the fame has gone into
my head I'm like what Fame what are you
guys talking about just it's a
misconception but I understand why
people think that though you know I
definitely do especially like looking at
my YouTube in my Instagram the fact that
I sit here I talk about you know like
all things beauty and how do glamorous
and makeup you know I'm saying and I
have designer bags and that kind of
stuff you know it might look like I'm
just like that next typical like but
that's not me at all at all I want to
defend myself I have to talk about that
but that's definitely biggest
misconception that I'm stuck up in
anyway or wherever that might be because
if you know me on a personal level or if
you've met me I can promise you that
that's not what you think about me will
there ever be a makeup geek and Jaclyn
hill favorites palette do you have any
advice for boys who wear makeup but get
told they shouldn't because they
of the male gender yes I do have advice
do you boo and screw the rest if someone
else does not appreciate the fact that
you are a male who's wearing makeup then
they can go bye-bye you don't need that
in your life you do you screw the rest
oh my god this is the best question ever
do you think Ross and Rachel were on a
break no what they were not on a break I
so do not support that she was like no a
break from us and he just turns around
and walks away and like oh you're on a
break now and yes I know I know that he
calls and Mark is there but he's even
given time to explain it he goes and has
sex with another girl you were not on a
break to me you were having a hard
moment you were having a hard time but
like the next morning you wake up you
get on the phone you figure things out
you don't go sleep with someone else I'm
100% team Rachel Ross you were not on a
break when and why did you decide to
move to Florida
well I didn't decide I was almost eight
years old I was seven I was very young
but we had to move to Florida because my
dad was involved in the very horrible
severe car accident and his legs are
actually all metal on the inside like he
has skin on his legs but inside instead
of bones he has metal rods and metal
plates he was in a horrible accident a
semi hit him head-on and crushed his car
he could no longer live up north because
his metal rods and his legs would freeze
in the wintertime and he would be in the
worst pain and it sucked so bad because
he couldn't sit outside like my
brother's games anymore in the
wintertime because his legs would freeze
so we had to move to a warm state so
they were like the Sunshine State
let's go so we moved to Florida in
January of 1998 I'd like to know the
story behind how you had your nose
broken I thought it might be a funny
story oh my god so my sister's husband
now her husband proposed to her in the
entryway of our home we came home from
shopping and her husband walked out with
the ring and roses and proposed she did
not know what's happening but my family
it was happening so my dad set the video
camera to record the whole thing we all
walk in the house he opens the door he
comes walking out she's like what are
you doing here because he lived in
Chicago she live in Florida he gets out
he opens it up and we got it all on
camera
la-dee-da I at the time was very into
videoing very into making videos so I
accidentally recorded over a little
piece of her engagement video to get a
piece of it I required over and it was
when he was on his meat in the middle
proposing I recorded over it for maybe
three to four seconds and it was
actually a shot of my sister dancing and
I clicked record and I was it wait
what's this tape so I unrecorded my
sister found that out and I was in my
bedroom listening to music dancing and
my sister comes in and punches me in the
face and when she walked in the room my
huge boom box was there and she tripped
and so when she tripped she like use her
fist like to catch her in midair and so
she tripped and split boom and just
right hooked me right across the face
and broke my nose so because of that my
nose is crooked I hate it and when I was
younger like I said I would record
myself all the time and all of a sudden
all my videos all I could notice was my
nose was just crooked so it sucks and I
thought about getting it fixed so many
times but I'm too scared I'm so scared
to be put under and get a nose job
everyone that I asked I just keep it it
adds character and I'm like whatever so
I don't like my broken nose but that's
how it happened and it is what it is
what's a weird habit of yours oh I have
it my husband loves this about me and I
don't know why but I grunt underneath
like my whatever it's like underneath my
breath I quietly grunt it's not as bad
as it used to be I try to stop and get
our control but like if I feel
uncomfortable anyway or if I'm watching
something it's funny and I know I'm like
about to laugh or whatever it's just
weird things like that I kind of it
there I go and I kind of like do like
this weird like kind of grunty like Moni
almost like an uncomfortable I don't
know it's a really weird habit though
and my husband called me out for it and
I'll be like doing it and I never ever
know I'm doing
don't hear it I don't notice it but I
look over my cousin always be like
looking at me I'm like what am i
grunting let I know that I am and he
catches me so that's a weird habit what
is your favorite type of doughnuts okay
maple glazed why don't people like maple
glazed like I don't understand it's like
these doughnuts are so underrated and
they're so good like of course I love
love love just like you know basic icing
and sprinkles but maple glazed is
everything and then of course the Krispy
Kreme one it's the one with the
chocolate on top and the white icing
inside not the pudding the yellow
pudding I can't do that the texture
freaks me out the icing it's like
frosting on the inside and chocolate on
top oh my god stop stop hey babe while
you're out would you mind picking it
done so that completes this incredibly
