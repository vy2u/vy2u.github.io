question and answer with John so I'm
very excited to see the questions that
you guys have
your breath smells good it's very minty
okay how difficult was that when you
first moved in together what has been
your favorite change about Jacqueline
the difficult part when we moved in
together is that first I was clean and
organized Oh Georgie Georgie Georgie
Georgie I was clean and organized and
she was messy
and I would always get on her case like
babe it's so messy in here why are you
just leaving all your stuff around I'm
like come on we can't live like this and
now it's the complete opposite it's like
he trained me to be clean and organized
and I trained him to be messy so now I'm
the clean one I'm neurotic about
everything being like clean and sterile
and no dust and no messiness seems like
very picked up all the time and now he
is just like just the roses stuff
everywhere and I'm always so it's like
we change roles free-spirited way of
living Oh curse Lucas who is a youtuber
here on that sound system who's a
youtuber here on YouTube she's such a
cool girl do you guys know who she is go
check her out she's so down-to-earth and
just so free and amazing anyways she
asks on Twitter what is something that
makes you both laugh the hardest
together there's so many me and Jonna
honestly that's the thing that Bond's us
the most is our humor and like we just
laugh all the time I mean that's to me
that is the glue of our marriage is our
humor the way she sings every song and
share voice always cracks me up that's
just one of millions though where did
all of Jacqueline's freckles cow I miss
my freckles so much remember when I used
to be such a freckle-faced yes cuz I
posted that picture and I hated it and
now I miss it so much I was covered they
were ever oh I loved it um Sarah asked
can you tell the story of how you and
John got back together after being split
for two months oh let's do it how do
people know that I mean I think you said
it in a video I don't recall ever
animation well we were split technically
a twice two times each time they were
about drugs addiction problems um the
first time was when we lived in Chicago
which is like the darkest time is for
both of us
and I just wasn't like doing what I
needed to as a husband and I went to
work and I got drunk at work and I came
home and when I came home the house was
and like she was gone and like
everything was there and I called her
freaking out
I just left one day and she just left
like her and her mom just went back to
Tampa together and she's like you need
to get yourself well before we get back
together it just pushed me to get to
where I needed to be to to be more you
know a better husband and back into my
relationship of my marriage so it took
it was actually what I needed yeah we
got married very young and you know
getting married at 19 has its plus and
it's negatives for sure like its pros
and cons and we were so in love and had
so much fun together but we were not
ready for all the baggage that we were
bringing into the marriage his parents
were going through a bad divorce and my
parents are going through a bad divorce
and actually they ended up both signing
the papers on the exact same day to make
their avoid divorce official which was
crazy like how having the exact same day
but um we just both came into the
marriage with a lot of baggage and I was
19 and he was 21 and I was getting tight
on you mother I know I have really like
my forehead problem like I was there for
him every single day every single night
and I was working 40 hours a week at the
max fourth time he was so far gone like
he was not like a functioning human
being at that point and I was trying to
talk to about it every single day and
there was just there was no getting
through to him like there was like this
wall there in front of his eyes like he
didn't see anything except like his
poison and his substance abuse and he
could not love anyone because he
couldn't love himself it was very dark
and very depressing and so basically one
day I finally said I can't do this like
I have been talking him for months about
like getting help and he just did not
care so finally one day when he was at
work I left I called his family I said I
can't do this you need to help your son
you need help your brother I cannot do
this like I can't fix this and I was
hoping to by me walking away that it
would kind of wake him up because at
this point he was he was truly days not
if not moments from dying it was so bad
he went
his dad and then I moved in with him in
Bellingham Massachusetts which it wasn't
ever about wanting to leave John I love
John and I never wanted to leave I just
needed him to get fixed and I knew that
by me being there next to him that like
I was enabling him and he would never
ever actually get better and I knew if I
left that it would be a wake-up call and
he did a holy shit I have to change my
life so that's what I was hoping for so
and then that ended up happening and he
went to his dad's house he got clean my
dad helped me we offered because he's a
doctor he helped me like you know
professionally helped me get off of it
without any horrible side effects so
once we moved to Massachusetts John was
clean and that's actually when I started
YouTube my first youtube video was in
Massachusetts once we once we had like
gotten back together after like six
weeks apart and then he went back to
drugs and alcohol again and that's when
he actually went to youtube so start you
to rehab I went to YouTube new exhibit
back to me actually went to rehab for
real and went through the steps that's
when I wanted to go like that's when I
was like I can't do this anymore if I
don't make this decision right now to
take my life serious and change
everything that I'm doing wrong I I mean
like I'm gonna die and I'm gonna lose my
wife so I immediately thought okay I
have to go to rehab and now I have to
come clean to Jacqueline and tell her
everything that's been going on and I
called her one day she was in Chicago
she had no idea that we had Georgie I
was on YouTube and I had no idea that
John was back on drugs and he was back
on them heavily and I kind of had a
slight suspicion but I was like no he
wouldn't do that but that's what addicts
do like they go back unless they had the
proper resources and people to keep him
accountable and he went back he fell
into it harder than he did the first
time I had just recently left Mac and
made YouTube my full-time job so that
was like my only source of income at the
time was just YouTube and so I had to
get on camera and put on a happy face
while my husband was in rehab in LA I
had just found out that he was doing
drugs behind my back and it was so hard
but it's just a lesson for everyone to
learn that you never know what's
actually going on in people's personal
lives behind the camera so now John is
able to talk about it and of course I've
never talked about this because even
though I'm his wife and it affected me
so much it's not my journey right john's
journey
percent and I was just there to support
him and be there for him in any way that
I possibly could and thank God he at
your four year anniversary clean is
actually on Monday
yeah so that's just four years clean
which is yeah it was very scary to know
like okay I'm gonna go to rehab and
that's like a gonna be a known thing in
my life were like I went to rehab and it
got so bad to the point where I had to
do that and all of Jacqueline's family
is gonna know because my thing was I
always wanted to keep it like a secret
and make me make myself look like as
good as I could but I mean everyone
actually knew like you know something
was wrong so it was just kind of like it
needed to happen even when I got back it
was still hard to like stay clean I know
Jacqueline pushed me to you know keep it
going and it just got easier like every
month it just got a lot better than
gradually you know I think it's really
cool and that he's had the confidence in
this moment to finally feel comfortable
enough after almost four years of being
clean because what he went through I
mean it is so common and I think that
it's really awesome that he's come
forward with his story to try to like be
honest and help other people because you
never should feel alone it happens to so
many people more people than you know
they're just hiding it and doing it at
home and they're functioning but it's
still a very big problem so never feel
alone where was the most awkward place
you guys had sex
the Miami bathroom oh my god that wasn't
awkward that was just stupid awkward was
your dad's bed hmm sorry dad Jessica
asks can John say bitch in the sassiest
most Jaclyn way that he can alright okay
and I did it in a weird monotone version
cuz I don't want you to get any ideas
for me but like act like oh you some of
my lipstick on your nose but act like I
just saw JLo performing the Grammys and
it just so late how would I say there
was like
no not at all like that come on bitch
bitch that was okay that was bad
I will make it that one all right how
long from when you met until you got
married
well we met when I was young it was it
was four and a half years yeah
I'm 16 I was 15 I was 17 she like one of
my friends had a crush on her and this
is way before the band mate we're still
friends with him too he's up he's funny
okay so basically is one night me and my
friends were hanging out of my house and
my good friend was there and he's like
hey John Hill has to come over to pick
up his wallet and I'm like all right and
he's like and I don't want you to think
he's hot because everyone thinks he's so
hot
I want you to start liking him and did
it I'm like all right whatever so like
me and him are really good friends so we
see on the couch watching Willy Wonka
and he that kind of started like cuddle
with me like in a weird way now I'm just
kind of like okay like I don't know I
saw him kinda like a brother and like
John walked in he was like holding on to
me I was like they should get off of me
this guy is so sexy I needed telling
that story again he probably live I
didn't tell about Saturday oh absolutely
and I thought we love him he's such an
awesome guy oh my god remember when I
first told him that we were dating and
like in love and I had you on the phone
and you're my phone in my pocket and I
was like I'm in love with your buzz
freighted he was like you the fact that
you did that is satisfied savage just
nasty
I was just where I was my dad's bad I
was like oh my god I hate us so much
we're so annoying would no wonder we
have no friends except Georgi what first
attracted you to Jacqueline physically
and personality-wise physically the
first time okay so she's saying first
the first time I ever saw Jacqueline it
was on MySpace it was like a picture of
her and she had like fire engine red
hair and her teeth were literally whiter
than snow with piss in it no no her
smile was beautiful her hair was like so
cool and her eyes just like compared to
the red hair it was just like explosive
and I was like who the hell is this like
I've never seen a girl look was hot so
one time I was on the balcony and
Jacqueline was out there and she's
talking and she's talking to me and I
around and I just see her eyes beautiful
like kind of slanted up just like these
fierce insane like cat eyes like they
just look like cat eyes and she looks so
beautiful I was just like blown away the
moment I look back I'm like hmm it blew
me away and that to me is yeah that's
the moment when I saw her I was like
holy shit he could even talk properly
and I was like what is going on I was
getting so insecure because I said oh my
god what if you just turned around and
saw me because like I was standing like
in the Sun like what the light beaming
in on me like oh my god this is like the
first time he's seen me like in the
light of day what if he's looking me
right not thinking like oh my god she is
not my cup of tea like that's what I was
scared of and then he told me later
how would he turned around that like he
couldn't breathe because he thought that
I was so beautiful I was like thank God
thank God then like her awesome person
was like then we picked a movie out okay
we're not gonna talk about that part
nope alright me I think my name is Malin
Kay she asked how do you how do y'all
keep your relationship so strong even
though you're both constantly busy T you
start just treating each other like
friends no roommate like friends and
like roommates like you just have this
girl always every time yeah exactly
you're like entitled to them and I don't
think that's cool like I never want to
get used to John just being here because
I think of home one day and John could
be gone and like I could be without him
I never want that to be the case so like
I always want us to like go above and
beyond til each other know like hey not
only do I love you but I like you and I
want to spend time with you and I want
to be your friend and I appreciate you
being around so I just taking time to
like appreciate each other put our
phones down give each other eye contact
ask one other how our day is and we plan
dates we plan terms we're like okay on
Wednesday at 6 o'clock we're turning off
our phones and we're just watching
movies until we go to bed you know like
we make those plans yes those are our
favorite things but just chill mine is
like use you just have to treat it like
you have to try and win her over like at
all times because if you treat it that
way isn't you're never gonna I don't
know you just you keep the zest the zest
just will stay does ask me like a little
lemon zest zest blush diary
ask what is John's most meaningful
tattoo it's hands down this little bitty
one right here that just says hold tight
is definitely the most meaningful one
because he got it after I had a dream it
was like one night I wasn't asleep one
night I was sleeping obviously I was
sleeping if I was dreaming but I had a
dream one night that it was when we were
going through so much bad stuff in our
life and it was so chaotic I had this
dream that we were out in the middle of
the ocean like an open water you can see
no land in sight and they're like these
huge and almost tsunami waves going over
top of us and like we were about to
drown and all of a sudden in my dream
like I would grab on to him and I would
grab his hand like this and I'll just go
hold tight and when we would like grab
each other's hand we would like shoot to
the bottom of the ocean like a rocket
ships and when we would get to the
bottom if we would like stand and we
would hold each other's hands we could
breathe underwater standing in the sand
and like we would look up and we would
just see all the waves and the storm
going over top of us and we were just
big planted in the sand I like this big
bubble where we can breathe and I woke
up and I was like crying and I was like
John I had a dream a dream oh my god and
I remember we sat in bed that morning
and talked about my dream for hours and
so we went that day and he got that
tattoo do as him
we just we stayed close and held tight
Idina ass never drink wine again or
never wear concealer again obviously
that's a question for me because John
doesn't drink or wear concealer and my
answer is never drink wine again I
rather wear concealer then drink wine
for sure what's your favorite meal that
Jacqueline makes she has made me this
bomb meal every morning it's like
Mexican rice with what is it beef ground
beef with like a taco seasoning black
beans rice black beans then red peppers
red pepper
avocado and then break an egg on it yeah
and then I like fried egg and break it
on top and like what the cheese melts on
it right he loves it how is your
hanky-panky life I've never heard
Jacqueline say anything about y'all
getting down
well since I never talk about sex that
must mean that we never do it sometimes
it's okay not to talk about every single
blowy on a Tuesday afternoon just saying
sometimes it is good to talk about it
though awesome last Tuesday moving on
what made Jacqueline want to grow her
hair out take out her piercings stop
smoking and completely change your style
um I would just say growing up I
remember when I got married and walked
down the aisle my grandparents my aunt's
my uncles they all were like why are you
going to walk down the aisle with your
lip rein in your nose-ring like you're
gonna regret that when you look back at
your photos like that's not timeless
like I got so much shit for that and
still I mean it's been eight years and I
don't have either of those piercings and
I don't anything like that but I'm so
glad that I pushed against them and just
wore my piercings and did my makeup the
way I wanted to because I was back at
that and I'm like oh my god that is the
girl that he fell in love with and like
that's how we met that's just that's
what's timeless about it you look back
and it's a time in your life where you
were just that person oh my god you
jumped themselves oh yeah they're in the
corner hiding scared they're terrified
George her name is Casey and she asked
our favorite thing about being married
ooh
my best friend is always at home with me
and takes care of me my best yeah I just
couldn't live with my best friend and
have new memories every year I think
that's perfect that's what I feel too I
love the fact that I just get to be with
you all the time like no matter who I
hang out with or what life like what
curveballs
it throws it's like I just always get to
be next to you at the end of the day
like you're the person I fall asleep
with tonight and that's my favorite part
is just knowing that like I'm in bed
with you every night thank you
you're cuter Cindy asks if you could
freeze yourself at one age what would it
be and why like go on but you would not
age and this
37 is mine well I obviously have not
reached my 30s yet and I honestly think
that 30s is gonna be my best time of
life I don't know why I've always just
had like this premonition if you will
that my 30s is gonna be the best as far
as like me emotionally I'm gonna have a
13 going on 30 moment for me if I had to
choose right now oh probably say 22
because I was so young but innocent and
naive and just blissful I was just so
like just naive and she was a very nice
that's something about job and that I
don't think many people know but when me
and Jacqueline well friends and was just
sort of dating she was so naive she had
no idea that the world had all these
horrible I don't know it's like
obviously she knew that but she was very
naive and she was just very quirky and
animated she wasn't like seasoned like
she is now like she didn't there was
just a part of her cuz she was
home-schooled and like I don't know
there was just like a very school
Joffrey exactly there's just like my
movie awkward side to her and everyone
at her job like kind of bullied her and
she kind of got bullied a lot as a kid
kind of Shh I want as a kid like a funny
way so she really was so weird and like
no one understood me no he's like but I
was always there like just thinking
don't pick on her like I just got so mad
when I remember she had a bully that
bullied her all the time it was like she
harassed her and would call her and be
like I'm gonna kick your ass and you but
like hang up the phone she made me cry
and one time I walk in and she's like
this crying like on the phone I'm like
who is that and she tells me and it's
thick bully and I was like tell her
you're gonna kick her ass cuz she has
never stood up for herself and she was
like really I was like tell you're gonna
kick her ass right now she was like I'm
gonna kick your ass
and hung up the phone and freaked out
and never mess with her again and I was
like see that's why this girl is messing
with her because she never stood up for
herself and now I have no problem saying
it for myself
maybe it's easy you mm-hmm I our first
dance at our wedding that's what we did
because we were such bad dancers really
we were like practicing for a couple
weeks and we're like oh God we're gonna
be so bad at this and we were just like
dancing around basically just like
humping each other on the dance floor
making out like my tongue was down his
throat and no we got done dancing like
the song ended and you're like mr. and
mrs. John Hale we worry about it like it
was just so weird all right how do you
guys saw solve your issues when you
fight I think not a lot of couples talk
openly about their fights but John are
very good men about my problems we throw
we are with the sickness we fight very
hard but murder absolutely I feel like
when we get into a fight and we're just
not seeing each other side we're like
you know what we don't see each other's
side and it's just not happening right
now we're going to sleep and we'll still
give each other a hug and a kiss
goodnight and be like I love you but I
do not like you right now and we'll just
turn our backs and we'll go to sleep and
then we wake up we have clarity and then
we're able to work through it in five
minutes but it's like you just get so
sick of just like the same thing and
with the same argument that you can't
see each other side until you like have
some separation yeah you gotta cool down
and once you cool down you're like yeah
I see your side and then you realize
like you're both right here so I love
this question what is your favorite
memory when you're dating I like that
one I have my favorite memories it's
it's not one specific memory but I have
a favorite memory
driving around in the back of Micah's
car just like wearing our cheap fake
leather jackets and smoking cigarettes
