a back to school makeup look I honestly
feel like this is more like a get ready
with me video just because that was
genuinely getting ready I will book this
morning and had a very short amount of
time to get ready and I was like it's
just totally something that I would do
if I was a high schooler so I just threw
up my camera and recorded myself so I'm
sorry that the lighting or the angles
are not on point but it really is just
me getting ready and showing you guys
exactly what I would do if I went to
high school which I can't really tell
you because I don't go to high school
because I was a homeschooled jungle
freak literally so yeah I hope that you
guys enjoy this video thanks so much for
watching and I'll see you soon
bye guys when hello first thing I'm
going to be doing today is my foundation
I am going to be using mac cosmetics a
face and body foundation this is a
water-based foundation it's great for
teenagers it's very hydrating and its
sheer I'm going to be using a makeup
geek foundation brush this is a
synthetic brush so it goes beautifully
with a water-based foundation like Mac
face and body and I'm just going to be
applying that all over my face evenly
and you'll see it makes you look very
dewy and very hydrated which I love
hahaha then I'm going to be going in
with NARS radiant creamy concealer I'm
going to stipple this all under the
under eye area and on the eyelid as well
which is very important for a day like
this because you want to really conceal
those veins on that eyelid area since
we're not going to be going in with a
ton of shadow because we just don't have
time look at the difference in my eyes
oh it's so creepy looking okay moving on
I'm going to of course do the exact same
thing to the other eye and I just want
to say when you're using a damp Beauty
Blender you can go a little overboard
with your concealer sometimes because
the hydration of that Beauty Blender
will soak up any excess concealer
underneath the eyes making it pretty
much impossible to have cake face then
I'm going to go in with the anastasia
banana color from her contour kit and
I'm going to set that entire under eye
area and it is very very important to
make sure you set that lid because if
you don't set that lid area with powder
it's going to become a very Creasy mess
throughout the day especially since
you're not going to be using tons of
shadow again so really make sure you set
that lid and this will give you just a
little bit of a glow and a nice
highlight
as well as setting the concealer now for
my brows I'm going to go in with the
Anastasia brow Wiz and the first thing
I'm going to do is just fill in any
blanks or gaps that you may have in your
brows which especially in my right brow
I have this area that really needs
attention because it's just like like my
brows just decided not to grow there and
then once I have just lightly filled it
in only in select areas I'm going to go
in with benefit give me brow which has
some fibers in it that really help plump
up the eyebrows and make it look like
you have more hair than you do and so
these two together on the brows really
do give such a natural effect to that
brow area and on a day like this where
you're doing minimal makeup you don't
want intense brows because you can kind
of like the man
see now I'm going to be taking one of my
favorite bronzers and this is Mac care
blend pressed powder in the shade medium
dark and using a fluffy brush I'm going
to use this as a shadow I love using
bronzers and blushes and highlighters as
eyeshadows on days when I'm doing
minimal makeup because it makes it so
much faster I don't have to reach for
additional eyeshadows so that's all I'm
doing is dusting that in my crease
getting me a little bit of warmth and
this will open the eye back up then I'm
going to go in with Becca opal
highlighter which of course is my
favorite highlighter of life I'm just
going to take that on my finger and
press that all over that lid area inner
corner and all I'm just going to smear
it everywhere with my fingers because
again this will save time and I'm going
to use this highlighter later on my face
so I might as well get it out put it all
over the lid and have it out so that I
can use it later these little things
just save a few seconds when you're
doing your makeup but overall it saves
you tons of time when you're really
trying to get ready and get out the door
quickly then I'm going to go in and curl
my lashes of course we're just going to
mascara the lashes today because we
obviously do not have time to be sitting
here messing with falsies so after
curling my lashes I'm going to go in
with two quick coats of mascara with my
favorite mascaras one is by Maybelline
and one is by Rimmel so I'm going to go
in make sure that when you are masked
scaring your lashes you really want to
go in quick little zigzag motions as
you're going up because this will help
volumize and eliminate clumping then I'm
going to go back with that same bronzer
as before it's technically not a bronzer
it is actually just a pressed powder to
set the face but I use it as a bronzer
because I just think it's the most
beautiful formula ever I fell in love
with this formula when I worked at Mac
then I'm going to go in with flower
child blush by Becca such a beautiful
color and it has a
slight sheen to it so it really makes
the face girlie and fresh and awake so
I'm going to put that all over the
apples of my cheeks working back towards
the cheekbones then I'm going to go back
with Becca opal see it all comes back
around and I'm going to dust this all
over the cheek area I'm using a morphe
fan brush and I'm really going to
highlight pretty much every area of my
face I'm going to highlight the chin the
Cupid's bow right up above the brow
because I am very dry and on a day like
this I love looking very highlighted and
dewy because it really makes me look
fresh and alive then I'm going to go in
with my first creation that I made with
drawing cosmetics and this is the lip
gloss in the shade Rose Hill this is the
perfect color for a day like today when
you don't want your lips to be too pink
or too red it's just very beautiful very
girly it makes you look again very fresh
so after that your look is complete I
hope you guys enjoy this quick easy back
to school makeup look I love you guys
and I'll see you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
