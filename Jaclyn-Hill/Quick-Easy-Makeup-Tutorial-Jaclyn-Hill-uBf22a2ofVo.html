when waking up in the morning and
running out the door one of the most
important things to remember is to wash
your face a lot of people make the
mistake of only washing their face in
the evening time and not in the morning
you have to remember that when you're
sleeping all the toxins and sweat are
coming out of your pores so it's very
important to wash your face in the
morning for health reasons and sanitary
reasons but not only that the
moisturizer will act as a primer and the
makeup will lay better on a clean face
as opposed to a dirty face I'm using a
Lancome moisturizer right now it's brand
new and exclusive only to Sephora I
absolutely love it you guys want to see
an index skincare routine that I do
every morning or every night just let me
know in the comment section below so at
this point I had curled my hair two days
prior to this I use the new me titan-3 I
do have a discount code for you guys and
I will list it in my description bar
below basically I'm just running a
teasing comb to just smooth everything
out and I will go in and just kind of
pump up the roots a little bit since I
do have naturally flat hair this will
just add more body in definition if
you're more oily you can use shampoo dry
shampoo I'm super dry so I only want
have to wash my hair about every 3 to 4
days and I will shower of course but I
will just put my hair in a bun on top of
my head to avoid getting it wet so I can
just keep it and wear it like this for a
few days moving on to makeup the first
thing I'm going to be doing is applying
foundation this is the YSL touchy claw
foundation in shade b40 it's a great
shade I would say it's a medium tone
with yellow and beige undertones so it's
not going to be super yellow or super
pink which is exactly what I'm looking
for because I'm more neutral with a
touch of yellow golden undertones which
is kind of tricky to match so b40 is a
great shape for that I'm using my Sigma
f80 kabuki flat top foundation brush
that was a mouthful as always if I'm not
using this brush I'm dead this is the
Maybelline fit me concealer and this is
the
shade light I'm going to just take this
and touch underneath my eye area inner
corner and then just one streak on top
of the lid going back in with this Sigma
brush I don't remember the number F
something I'm not positive but it comes
in the synthetic kabuki brush kids thing
yeah anyways I will list all the brushes
that I use in this entire video and all
the products down below in my
description bar including outfit and
things like that whoa look at the
difference in concealer then I'm going
to just do the exact same thing to the
other eye I love this concealer on days
where I'm moving super quickly because
it's a medium coverage so it's not super
thick it blends out beautifully it kind
of feels like a mousse and it doesn't
crease I recommend it to everyone
plus it's super affordable since it is
from the drugstore and this brush just
blends it out
gorgeously on the entire face and I take
whatever is left over and I just kind of
pop it up by the brows and in the middle
of the forehead and then I'm going to
take my bare minerals original
foundation and shade light this is the
one that has a luminous shade to it I
talked about it in my favorites video
with another Sigma brush that I will
list below and I'm just going to tap
that in my t-zone area I do not put this
above my top lip because I think that
when you put foundation and powder on
your top lip it can tend to break up
throughout the day then I'm going to
fill in just the outer portion of my
brows to make this super quick I'm not
going to do anything to define them
other than just use the Anastacio brow
is this is in shade soft Brown and then
I'll go in with the opposite end on the
spoolie and just kind of buff it around
so that it doesn't look harsh there's no
lines and it'll look a little bit more
blended but just sticking on the outer
tail I won't bring it in whatsoever to
the inner corner this is the easiest way
to bring attention to the eyes and
define the brows
without it looking overboard or taking
too much time on them to make them look
absolutely perfect like we normally do
then I'm going to take any bronzer I'm
using benefit hoola bronzer this is the
easiest way to just kind of sculpt out
your lid and contour your eye without
having to bust out a whole palette and
pick a shade so just take a bronzer and
just put it with a big fluffy brush in
the crease and dust it back and forth
I'm mainly focusing on the outer corner
and bring it up towards the brow area
but I'm also sweeping it in just to
define the entire
eyelid then I'm going to take steel up
kitten eyeshadow one of my favorite
eyeshadows it is such a beautiful
shimmery all over the lid color I'm
going to pop it on the inner corner with
any small shader brush you have or a
q-tip would even work as well and I'm
just going to put this on the inner
corner just to brighten us up and wake
us up a little bit since we aren't doing
any other shadow then I'm gonna take
makeup geek corrupt which is the
blackest black and we're getting
interrupted by my sweet little niece and
we're going to make some faces for you
I'm in Chicago right now at my sister's
house so we are obsessed with each other
that's why this is happening right now
okay moving off I'm going to take this
on just a flat definer brush and just
stipple it right in my lashes and kind
of flick it upward as you can see me
doing I'm not bringing this too far to
the inner corner I'm definitely focusing
on the outer edge of my eyelid that way
I can go in and blend this out and it's
not going to really look like eyeliner
but yet it's going to define the eye so
just using any pencil brush with no
product on it or you can put a little
bit more bronzer on it or whatever you
want I'm just kind of fluffing this
around this is a great way to do
eyeliner when you're in a rush and
you're just running out the door and you
don't have to worry about it being
perfect then I'm going to go in and curl
my eyelashes I am using a new Lancome
eye eyelash curler that I got Sephora
I'm gonna be honest I like the Mac one a
lot better than this one then I'm gonna
go in with L'Oreal voluminous full
definition mascara this is from the
drugstore it's one of my favorite
mascaras of all time it gives such great
volume makes your lashes a lot thicker
for the girls like me who have skinny
little spider lashes so I'm just gonna
coat my lashes I'm going to give them
about two coats since I'm not doing much
other to the eye and then I'm going to
just put on clear brow gel because I did
forget I am using the Anastasia brow gel
I know it's a little bit more expensive
than others you can find at the
drugstore but it honestly keeps your
brows on like glue not one hair is going
to move and I love it so much
I'm using Milani Luminoso blush this is
a beautiful peachy pink color and it's
got a little bit of shimmer in it and
I'm going to just tap this on the cheeks
I'm only using blush today no
highlighter no bronzer since this is a
super quick makeup tutorial and I
think the blush is the most important
and if you have one with some shimmer in
it you don't need a highlighter because
it will just do that for you then I'm
going to use YSL this is a lip stain I'm
not sure of the color I'll list it below
this is the same thing as the l'oreal
one that they have at the drugstore the
why i saw one just lasts a little bit
longer I actually bought on accident but
I loved it so much I kept it so yeah
after that I'm just gonna go on and coat
the bottom lashes just because we can't
forget that this is usually something
that I'll end up doing it a stoplight
and the car if I'm in a rush and then
I'll go back with a q-tip and just clean
up some mistakes I made if you wait for
the mascara to dry it'll just rub right
off with a q-tip I'm using Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray and I'm going
to just spritz my entire face with this
to set everything so that nothing moves
fan it off and give it a moment to dries
to your mascara doesn't get stuck to
anything since it is wet but after that
we are complete with the makeup look and
I really hope you guys enjoy
you
gross gross I don't like it yay any
bronzer no contour no highlight no dry
powder
yeah but that's what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
