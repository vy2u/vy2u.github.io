like already laughs I think just because
like you know just cuz I know that this
video is gonna make me so uncomfortable
and I don't even know why I'm putting
myself through this but this has been a
really requested video for a very long
time coming
this was a really popular video about I
would say a year ago everybody that I
know did it and I just felt like I can't
I can't it's just gonna make me cringe
so hard I can't I can't deal with it but
then you know over the past year of my
life I've done a lot of cringe-worthy
things so I got very used to it very
comfortable with it and I was like you
know what screw it let's do it as a lot
of you guys know there have been some
very big changes in my life as of
recently and some major adjustments are
just rich adjustments and I just thought
that it's like the perfect opportunity
and time to go back and just watch where
everything began here my youtube channel
I feel like I'm kind of like reinventing
myself and coming back to life now that
like some news has broken out recently I
have chosen to share with you guys and I
want to get back on YouTube and I want
to get back to doing what I love so I
thought it's the perfect timing to just
like take a little trip down memory lane
and watch my very first youtube video
which I have not watched in a very long
time I'm gonna Trevor there hasn't
hardened myself even though I know this
is not gonna be let me start recording
my screen I feel so pro right now I'm
recording my screen
I feel so high-tech I need some glasses
I'm not kidding like stuff like this
makes me feel so cool I'm like I am
recording it by computers create it guys
this is big deal oh girl here it is
no I'm gonna be nice I'm not gonna make
vomiting noises I'm not gonna be a
little bitch to myself I'm gonna be nice
oh my gosh I did weather a phase right
there what the heck just a quick
background of where I was in life when I
first started youtube I was currently
dealing with major anxiety and
depression and I was living in Boston
with my ex-husband's father we were on
the struggle bus I was driving the
struggle bus or maybe I was sitting in
the back I don't know but I was
somewhere on the bus and it was not a
good place it was not a good time we
moved in with his father because we were
so broke we couldn't even support
ourselves we couldn't pay any of our
bills plenty care of ourselves it was a
low point and I had just gotten a job at
the Mac in
Natick Massachusetts oh I was working at
the max or there I had transferred from
Chicago to there so that's our I was at
in life when I started my youtube
channel okay let's go
oh we got like my lips
okay so again very wearable holiday look
inspired by my question he's going to be
on the cover of Glamour I just start in
the middle by sentence look at my lips
promo shots for it and I was like oh my
gosh yes I don't think that like I'm
trying to say I look like her or
anything I know I guess I'm not cube if
you're not so annoyed that you haven't
turned out this video I already keep
watching oh good not okay first of all
my lips are so what just like skinny so
thin like I have lip filler and nose
filler so for me to see my nose and my
lips I'm like who is that it's so weird
I can like see the insecurity and me
already in this video like I'm so in
secure like me sitting there being like
I know I don't look like her I get it
I'm not cute and if you're not so
annoyed by this video and you haven't
turned it off already like I was so
nervous and so insecure
damn bitch that's a little ugly
exhausted first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm going to take we get it you're so
tired because any color would work like
right here any color from this entire
palette that's a lot no look at that
palette I have a head natural nails and
stubby nails that's right I used to
always highlight my brow bone first that
was always the first thing that I did
whenever I start my makeup routine was
highlight my brow first I don't know why
cuz now like when I think about it
doesn't make sense if you had your brow
first and then you go in with your matte
shades you kind of wipe off the
highlight so what your point because
once you get a shadow on you're gonna
realize that you don't really want too
much highlight there what is this camera
angles we would have happening later
otherwise just put it there do you hear
the background music I'm literally
listening I'm watching Sex in the City
full blocks while I'm recording a
tutorial like I said that's acceptable
I'm going to
and pigment called vanilla and just like
that yes I literally use this segment
probably I'm not even exaggerating like
70 times my life look at how are you
though are you not exaggerating seventy
times Jacqueline really okay where's the
receipt why are you using a natural hair
bristles to apply look there's not even
pigment going on to my eyes look at this
this is so zoomed in that kind of line
makes me anxious I'm like back up I
can't see what I'm doing right now my
right eye what's happening pretty much
look the same you're just gonna see this
when you look down and close your eyes
look at this shot right now look at this
shot colors texture soft brown a minute
a minute there's colors on my palette
and the Jacksons no palette that
basically are like they're saying who's
gonna place that there I'm gonna take it
up and over top of that vanilla pigment
that we put on over to this side and
when we're done with those steps another
pigment really won't be very vibrant
whatsoever it'll just be a little touch
a little something in the center of the
eyes no I really like was a teacher like
as i'm walking it's like it's hard for
me to even like talk to the camera
because i'm actually like so focused on
what I'm saying cuz I'm just like you
know what she's talking a lot like I you
know where I get that from is Mac
working at MAC Cosmetics they told us
that we were never supposed to be quiet
that we have to constantly talk to the
customer and that's what that is so I
don't that's me just like knowing what I
learn from
as I did make up I was always talking
about my steps and that's right this is
how I always brought my youtube channel
that's why I'm always like trying to
teach and go above and beyond to make
myself perfectly clear it's cuz that's
how I was training it back to me look
now that now that I'm blending out all
that vanilla pigment is gone mile is
blank you should've used some fix+ bitch
oh my god those are a lot of wrinkles
okay Botox yeah do it do it it's just
totally different than hard to my other
now so I just great camera angle
Jacqueline you're doing great sweetie
oh we can totally see everything you're
doing this amazing mama yes there's the
oh that's like your wing is cute
my wing is so different now like I said
goodness because that's actually a tip
that I forgot about agent implement
Madigan's this shot is so zoomed into my
eyeball I honestly feel like I'm an
optometrist dr. kalbi eye doctors really
helped felt like such a dumbass
like it's a lot of eyeball
go in I'm gonna add false lashes and I
will be right back my lashes on now my
shop on the way I said that like Jack
would just stop just Oh
- she's Ernie was okay do you know her
oh you know Kim okay my gosh like I
don't edit out like whitening like
mascara wait now I would edit that stuff
out like I wouldn't keep that in there
it's so different I haven't gotten a
little bit of mascara on that Eric or
mine it's making me crazy I wanted go in
with a q-tip next month I'm really late
my bottom lashes have gotten longer
that's crazy they're shorter here than
they are no bitch what are you doing
this is something that she does Oh does
she always highlight here that's what
you call high waiting here under that
eye in that wing this is sad I'm sorry I
apologize and highlight I'm using oh no
no no Jacqueline this is no no don't do
that no this is not highlighting she's
next
that's a terrible word it was that way I
see nothing and then I highlighted my
nose and I hated my nose because it was
broken and I'm like oh let me just go
ahead and accentuate the thing that I
hate the most
hey manager taught me that oh she's back
she's back she's closed up again kandi
as always from that oh my god look at my
tiny lips Oh Oh finished look oh oh okay
well well she's done okay great I have
to say I was expecting to like like he
can like shrink back and like cringe way
more than I actually did overall the
lighting is horriffic which is crazy
because I remember filming that video
and I use a total crap camera it was
like way less than a hundred dollars and
my lighting in that video was literally
a lamp I just took the lampshade off and
it was just a bulb and it was right next
to the TV and I had sex in the city to
play and I had my light bulb and my
bright idea and a mirror and that was it
and I was like the whole time I was
doing makeup I kept like adjusting the
lamp with my left hand as I was doing my
makeup with my rights like get more
light on my face crazy I just had no
idea what I was doing but you know what
you got to start somewhere and I love I
love seeing people's first videos and
going back to that like almost reminds
me because even though I still think I
have a very far way to go in my career
and like I still don't think that what I
do is awesome like I still think like
every day I'm like how can I make this
better I want to be better still like
it's a great reminder to see like where
I came from and know like you know what
that's where I started and this is where
I'm at right now and I'm really proud of
that I'm really proud of my humble
beginnings and the struggle that I went
through and I loved it so the girl need
some help but you know I'm you learn as
you go so I hope that this shows you
guys that if you have a dream whether
it's YouTube or anything in life that
you just you chase it you go go for you
know run within don't anybody tell you
know because in that video I had so many
people and that's how my life so many
people who didn't believe in me so many
people that were just like oh you and
John are never gonna make it like when I
say make and I'm talking about make it
as a couple which is like make it people
were like what are you gonna do you need
if you have college degrees like you
don't have like a stable job that's
gonna last you forever like what are you
doing like we just had so much
hate on us and I still chase my dream
you know when people talked crap about
it even my own family not my immediate
family not my mom and my brothers and my
sisters but like my feeling that versus
still we're just like what are you doing
your life you're gonna be a youtuber
okay you're gonna do makeup okay people
made fun of me you know and yeah it's
awesome to go back and see that and just
be like hell yeah girl like I want to
give her a big hug and be like you got
this it's gonna be okay anyways yeah so
that's it you guys seriously this is
like the fastest video I've ever thrown
my entire life like I've only been
rolling for 23 minutes like what like
I've never found a video in less than an
hour in my entire life I feel like I'm
missing something but that's it so I
hope that you guys enjoy this video and
now I know that you guys are gonna go
back and watch other old videos of me
and just cringe because I know there's
worse ones than that yeah I know there
are they got a lot worse like later on
where I started adding bloopers in of my
dorky ass okay I won something on it cuz
that's gonna put me in a bad place I
love you guys so thank you for watching
