literally the most spontaneous video
I've ever done here my channel except
for maybe like back in the day like when
I first started YouTube I would like
film videos sitting in front of my couch
I would you like my monthly favorites
and stuff like that but yeah so long
story short I am doing this video for
you guys today because at my cap you
guys have no need to get sassy that's
the way of playing by the way like
that's not them being mean like that's
how they have fun I don't in any way
understand how that's fun but they enjoy
it so yeah back in the day to sit in
front of my couch and like report it was
totally normal but I feel like recently
I don't do like laid-back videos anymore
and I would really like to start doing
more laid-back videos and this is the
perfect opportunity what is happening
Georgie what what do I have Bo anyway so
let's just jump in the video okay it's
getting weird let let's just start
answering some questions
I feel like Ace Ventura okay we're done
long story short I am using my vlogging
camera which is a very tiny camera it
doesn't have a hair suck on my lip it
doesn't have a tripod so I'm like
setting it on like a vase right now
making it work so if this angle is like
all sorts of weird that is why in my
arms look so white compared to like what
what what what's happening so it is it
is 11:15 right now on a Friday night
jonatha the studio and I'm by myself and
I was sitting around and I was like
let's let's film let's do a question and
answer I haven't done one in a while and
I've seen a lot of requests for one
recently so I was like let's do it
Caroline asked what is the weirdest
addiction you have um I don't think I'm
actually addicted to anything but like I
have weird habits if you hear like
grunting like a pig that's Georgie by
the way um I do have a habit though
picking my eyelashes I will sit and do
this like I've done this since I was
like 13 years old just pic and my lashes
like this and then like I'll kind of
like tug on it and I'll pick off the
mascara up and wear mascara it's such a
bad habit I hate it it's not an
addiction but it's something that I do
and like everyone calls me out for
everyone's like stop picking your lashes
and I'm like I don't know but tons of
people are asking me what I use to
whiten my teeth and I still use dr.
George which I talked
back in the day and I also use crest
whitening strips like I'll kind of go
back and forth in my routine do you guys
want to see an updated teeth whitening
routine because if you guys want to take
a whole video on it I will go ahead and
do that for you just let me know
annika asks what camera do you use for
selfies are there any special settings
your photos look amazing and
professional boo on things annika um I
use the one I'm using right after
vlogging it is the sony a5100 like
everybody has it right now I have a
little flip screen so you can see
yourself even though I don't use the
slip screen I just hold the camera I
just like points like I know the angles
I want um yeah sony a5100 is an amazing
amazing camera the flash is what makes
like your details pop like your
highlight pop and your eyeshadow pop and
all that it's an amazing camera for like
outfit of the days shooting outside like
you're going to be in the Sun or makeup
brooklyn asks how how do you do with all
the hate you get PS I Love You PS I love
you too um how do you do how the hate
you get I don't do very well with it
honestly I mean like you guys can see my
snapchats like I I get upset a lot of
times I freak out a lot of times um I
don't know it was never expecting to be
where I am on YouTube never in a million
years I think I had to lay subscribers
and ever in a million years that I think
that there would be hate blogs about me
and never in a million years I think
that people be making up lies about me
and saying I'm a trust-fund baby and I
was born into wealth and I mean like all
the ridiculous things I've heard that
John is secretly cheating on me with
other bloggers it's like oh my gosh this
is the things I do not deal with it well
never in a million years I think this
was my life I was never prepared for
this when I got on YouTube I just
thought like hey I'm gonna get on
YouTube I only knew for the people that
did it and I just thought like you know
this is so cool this is exciting and
kind of scary the same time but let's
see what happens and I never ever ever
thought like I thought greatest scenario
ever would be 100 subscribers like that
was like Oh Queen a hundred subscribers
if you could only use makeup from one
company forever which would it be oh my
gosh I have absolutely no idea I don't
think I could do that I think I would
have to choose Mac just because Mac has
like a range of everything like no brand
has like a range of everything like Mac
does you know what I'm saying but I
don't want it to
Mack but I think that's what I'd be
forced to choose Isabella asked if you
won the lottery what is the first thing
you would do love you love you too
Isabella can I call you Izzy okay we're
like that's good now what is the first
thing I would do um I mean I would get
all my best friends and loved ones out
of debt for sure there are a few people
in my life that of course I'm not going
to name their names because it's no
one's business oh there's a few people
in my life that I would give just like a
huge chunk of money to just like I love
you here you go you're freaking awesome
you deserve it and then I would
definitely start something or either
give like a couple million dollars to
organizations helping children and
helping human trafficking for sure like
that would be like my process of
priorities and then I would buy a boat
Jacqueline where do you see yourself
five years from now do you think you
will still be doing YouTube I honestly
don't know I don't know five years from
now I mean five years is so far and five
years ago I had a five-year plan but
then that plan changed and I feel like
even if I make plans things just happen
so much I mean come on three years ago I
literally couldn't pay my bills Jonna I
could barely afford to eat we were going
to the McDonald's dollar menu printing
out coupons three times a day
and now like my life I'm so blessed like
look at what YouTube has done for me and
look at what you guys have done for me I
mean like I don't know where I'll be in
five years I hope that I'm still making
videos I hope that YouTube still gives
me the opportunity to do this with you
guys
and I mean of course I have plans
outside of YouTube um but yeah I really
hope that in five your smile I'll still
be doing this but God who knows who
knows what will happen in five years
seriously Russia asked chocolate
flavored poop versus poop flavored
chocolate oh my god that is disgusting
hold on chocolate flavored poop versus
poop flavored chocolate who played with
chocolate I can't leave that I'm even
answering this question like
legitimately but hell yeah poop flavored
chocolate I rather eat something that
tastes like poop but yet you know which
chocolate I don't care how good someone
 tastes I'm not eating it
favorite Starbucks drinks at the moment
and drinks you recommend okay so you
guys know like on snapchat that I go
crazy over the same drink so maybe talk
about it because I will start salivating
it so freakin good
I don't drink caffeine when I used to
drink caffeine I was obsessed with a
caramel macchiato with two shots of
espresso and extra caramel on top that
was like my um but now that I don't
drink caffeine caffeine now that I don't
drink caffeine for the past a year and a
half I drink the passion fruit iced tea
lemonade and just recently because of
you guys I get that with raspberry syrup
I asked for one pump because two pumps
can be a little much so I for one pump
of raspberries raspberries are up one
summer we have berries here um and I
also get it sweetened so passion fruit
iced tea lemonade sweetened with one
puff of raspberry it's so complicated
but it's so worth it get a venti get a
venti especially like a hot summer day
you'll be like why the hell did I not
get a venti cuz you're big Jessica asked
if I can do more videos with John and
yes I can told you more videos with John
I'm sure you wouldn't mind getting back
on camera at all you guys just let me
know what you want to see with us and
we'll do it
adalah said on Father's Day you said you
could relate to people who didn't have a
good dad can you explain how you relate
so I mention that on snapchat on
Father's Day um yeah I just don't have a
good dad so uh growing up my dad was
very controlling and very manipulative
my dad has a lot of issues and her our
family in many ways but I think that we
can all kind of look back and say that
we're thankful for what happened because
it made me my mom my brother my sister
so much closer and it made us such a
strong family and we went through such a
terrible divorce I mean oh so ugly and
so horrible that I really look at the
good in it more than anything now
because since that divorce we have all
learned to enjoy life more we have all
learned to lighten up because when you
go through something that sucks so bad
for so many years you learn like the
small doesn't matter you're like it
could be the way it used to be just the
fact that I'm not going that anymore I
feel like I can handle any storm because
I'm like at least it's not as bad as it
used to be you know I'm saying so I'd
like to look at like the positive side
of it but yeah my dad isn't around I
haven't spoken to my dad in years and
who doesn't have a shitty father
honestly like I'm just being real I have
so
my friends and all my friends I think I
have two of them who have good dads so
if you're one of those people who have a
good dad I hope you know how lucky you
are I would give anything to have a
loving wonderful father who wants to be
there for you out of the kindness of his
own heart because he cares and his own
selfless reasons I mean that would be
incredible I don't know what that's like
but that's okay I have one hell of a mom
and I am so grateful for her
Lexi asks how old were you when you and
Jon first met I was I think 14 maybe 15
when Jon and I at first met funny story
my really good friend at the time he was
a guy he told me he's like you're gonna
meet my friend John Hill but you're not
allowed to think he's hot because every
girl thinks he's hot and it drives me
crazy and I was like that is the
weirdest thing for you to ever say but
okay he walked in my house and I was
like holy he's so hot
Lexi said I was offered a job at Mac and
I'm thinking of doing it how do you look
back on your time working there good bad
and why girl take it yes I loved working
at Mac I did not love working at Mac
down south in Florida but all of my up
north experiences were incredible I
loved working at Mac they just took the
artistry so far and they made it so
important and just emphasize on the
artistry and then when I moved it was
more about the money and I was like I
can't do this and it's funny because
when I lived up there they were all
about the artistry and they were like
taking pictures of like the makeup that
you did and they were just so
encouraging and my sales like I was like
the number one in sales like me and this
other girl we were both like tight all
the time like number one in sales and
always like your sales are so great your
tables were great and I like to even
notice I didn't care I was just so
excited to be there and working and
doing makeup then when I moved to
Florida and I came back down here and I
transferred to this Mac they were so
obsessed with sales and so obsessed with
money and I was the worst in the entire
store like my sales were always down
they were constant playing in the office
like your sales suck and I'm like that's
because you guys don't care about
artistry I'm not a sales person like I'm
sorry I don't know how to sell but I
know how to do makeup and I love what I
do and like I just had so much more fun
up there because they were just so much
more focus on the artistry you guys know
I'm saying does that make sense so this
is the second time now that I have had
to go and charge my battery for like 20
minutes
and sit to the side I'm just letting you
guys know because I can case the
lighting changes or like the angle
changes
as my battery keeps dying and I'm just
sitting there like I'm the leave asks I
love your taste in fashion and designer
choices
were you always into higher-end items or
is that something more recent
well something more recent but yet not
something more recent I have always been
into fashion I mean like if you ask me
hey do you want this bag and these
clothes and these shoes and this makeup
or this Mercedes I'm gonna be like I
want the closet like I Drive a Honda
you're I'm saying like that's not
important to me like some people they're
like oh I have to drive the best car
like I have to roll up everywhere
looking amazing in my Lexus I really
care you know I'm saying like I care
about my shoes so I have always this has
been my style I have always been in
fashion always been into high-end things
like that but I've never been able to
afford them um in the past I mean even
when I couldn't afford anything I still
knew designer names and new designer
brands I knew the current handbags I was
looking in the magazines just thinking
like oh my god that's so beautiful or I
would like watch unboxing videos and
think oh my gosh that purse is so
gorgeous like that type of thing but it
hasn't been up until recently that I've
actually been able to purchase them um
but you'll but you'll never see me like
flaunting anything designer like you'll
never see me do a closet tour even an
outfit of the days photos like if I'm
holding something super expensive I'll
like try to like hide it to the side and
I know a lot of you guys will be like
upset with me you'll be like girl you
have it blog to work it talked about it
but that's just not my style because I
never want anyone to think that I'm like
braggy or showing off or like I like
forgotten what's important in life or
whatever maybe and the things that
people come up with just by seeing that
you have nice things you know I'm saying
so I've always loved high-end things but
I haven't been able to actually afford
them until recently Optimus Prime asked
I love that name I used to have like a
mad crush on Optimus Prime yes I'm
talking about the robot from
Transformers I'm not joking I thought he
was like so badass
anyways Optimus Prime asked did you
think that you and Jon we're going to
get married when you were younger at
love-u love-u to optimus um so many
questions about Jon you guys really
wanted Karma I like him too
um yes actually I did when I was like 15
years old I used to always say to my mom
oh I'm gonna marry him I'm gonna marry
him mm big oh I know you are like joking
around with me
um when I introduced him to my good
friend Micah
when I was 18 years old I was like oh
yeah he's my future husband and she was
like I thought you like have a boyfriend
like that you're like on a break with
right now Isaac no I am like I'm with
him but like one day I know down the
road like I'm gonna marry him like
that's how I introduced him to people
behind his back like is that so creepy
I've always known Oh like I swear to God
and we only dated for like six months
and we're like let's get married we were
laying in bed one night he leaned over
and he was like I I think I'm gonna
marry you and I was like I know I'm
gonna marry you and he was like really
because I know I'm gonna marry you - I
didn't want like me to understand
persons get married dev asked do you do
anything every morning to make sure that
you have a great day that's a really
good question no I don't do anything
every morning like I don't like read
daily devotions or anything like that
when I first wake up but every single
night when I go to bed I do pray every
night no matter how shitty my day has
been I will take the time to thank God
for all my blessings for my subscribers
for my home for the air I breathe for my
health for everything in my life I will
just take five minutes John and I both
just to count our blessings and just
thank the Lord for our life and our
blessing so I do that every single night
and it's so funny because I'll tell John
I was just talking to him when we were
eating dinner last night I was like I
feel like sometimes like the whole day
I'm like hey guys and then I get a bet
on my thank you Jesus like I swear
well like I do I make sure every night's
like really go back to what's important
and be like thank you God for giving me
this life because I do not deserve it
Audrey asked if I had any advice for
being successful and then she says love
you girl love you - Audrey um I don't
even think of myself as successful
because that's just like I don't know
everything has just happened so fast but
I will say that if you want to succeed
in anything the piece of advice that I
have for you is to find what it is that
you love and do not stop doing it I mean
it doesn't matter if it's in the makeup
world or if it's you want to be a nurse
you want to save lives you want to be a
fireman like if you want to be a
schoolteacher like whatever it is if you
want to be successful in your field
focus on that one thing and obsess over
it and live and breathe it don't let
people tell you no don't let your family
tell you no don't your best friend tell
you no just keep going like turn their
nose and TSS prove them wrong another
that I've always liked I've learned this
from my husband's father um he always
told me he was like never speak too soon
if you want to do something don't tell
people your plants don't tell them I'm
gonna do this because they're gonna get
into your head and they're gonna screw
with you and they're gonna make you feel
like you're not good enough you're not
gonna achieve your dreams so just shut
your mouth put yourself to work work as
hard as you can and don't start telling
people until you've already succeeded so
instead of saying hey man I'm running
this marathon no no don't say that
because you're gonna have people be like
you you're running the marathon okay
instead train your ass off run that
marathon and then meet them at the bar
and say hey guess what I did today I ran
a marathon and I won I learned that from
my father-in-law and it's helped me so
much just to kind of keep things to
yourself work hard work quietly work
diligently don't get ahead of yourself
and don't share your dreams with
everyone around you because like my dad
always said a four by six mind cannot
fit an eight by ten dream and for those
of you who are dreamers and you have 8
by 10 dreams you can't squeeze an 8 by
10 and a 4 by 6 so you have to dream big
and you have to do it on your own and
make it happen so I mean that's just
what I say as far as success is find out
what it is that you love and perfect it
perfect it like no one else has
perfected it before and just keep doing
it Jesse asked team Jake or team Fitz
from scandal if you guys watch scandal
you're my kind of people
um team Fitz I know tons of you Viper
gaming know Jake he's so hot
know this I am all about Fitz from the
second that show started I was like Fitz
Fitz that's my heartbeat it's saying
fist fist yes I love him so much I feel
like him and olivia hasn't mean that him
and Jake never her and Jake never will I
am team Fitz Megan asks will you ever
come out with your own makeup line I
would buy anything you make hashtag huge
fan Thank You Megan that is so sweet of
you and yes yes I will I have been
working on it for two years and to be
continued pick one Kardashian slash
Jenner go Caitlyn obviously princess
Sarah love your name says would you
rather have long nose hairs that you
can't trim or a beard you can't shave
long nose hairs that I can't trim I
can't contour with five o'clock shadow
Jaime Brauer asks are you going to be
collaborating with makeup geek cosmetics
in the near future
I am girl mom and we excited I'm doing a
like favorites palette with them I'm
also creating my own custom shadows with
makeup geek hey Elizabeth asked if I
like to sneeze and it's actually a
really amazing question because I
freaking love to sneeze I could sneeze
all day every day like sneezing is the
biggest relief ever sneezing is one of
those things that you don't know how
badly you need it until it comes out and
you're like everybody forgot my whole
life
Amanda asked where would be your
ultimate dream vacation Santorini baby
someone asked if you could change your
name to anything what would it be it
would be Riley Riley Riley Hill RI Ellie
why Riley I would love that
do I look like a Riley I feel like
Riley's are just like cool chicks
joseline said I'm probably too late for
the video but do you work out I don't
work out okay I don't want to admit that
I don't work out I used to work out like
a fiend I used to be a cheerleader I
worked out seven days a week
I ran miles around my neighborhood every
single day in the football field I have
not worked out in like the past year and
a half and it is horrible I am like the
doctor called me skinny fat I went to
the doctor a couple weeks ago there
you're what we call skinny fat your body
fat is too high in percentage and I'm
like great she's like but yet you look
skinny I'm like great that's awesome so
I do need to start working out again
very badly I just hate how like
everything is kind of like jiggly and
loose I want everything to be like
it--like it used to like my butt used to
be like up higher and tighter and the
grounder and now she's come on what are
your siblings names I have a sister
Rachel I have a brother Nicholas and
then my Nicholas my Nicholas my
brother's wife is Adina and my sister's
husband is Jon so it's Jacqueline
Nicholas Adina Rachel John and John
there's two doors in our family I know
it can be confusing how tall are you I
am just a pinch under 5 7 favorite
female celebrity oh my god I initially
want to say Jennifer Lopez that's like
my first initial reaction but there's so
many female celebrities I just love it
I'm like ah and I go through like phases
where I'm a close person like I love
Jennifer Lopez because the woman can
dance and like I love her values and her
morals I just I love her like spice to
fire her sass I just love her I love
Christina Aguilera still today because
her voice no one can like get me weak in
the knees at Christina Aguilera can
Jennifer Lawrence as a person I think
Jennifer Lawrence and like her views on
life I like the fact that she doesn't do
social media because she doesn't wanna
be criticized or scrutinized and loved
Jennifer Lawrence for that reason
Cameron Diaz I adore Cameron Diaz Sarah
Parker freaking loved Sarah Parker so
much I literally bought this just
because she's on the cover like if she's
in anything or anything I buy it
I love Angelina Jolie she's at the top
of my list look Haley asks what is one
thing you don't like about YouTube whoo
that's deep Ailee that's deep
the worst thing about YouTube is people
not understanding that you are only
sharing what you want people to see like
right now what you are seeing me might
highlight my pillows this is staged this
is what I want you to see over here
there's courts over here the dogs are
sleeping there's a mess you know what
I'm saying like the TV is on in the
background my house is not perfect right
now it doesn't look amazing but I'm
making it look amazing you know I'm
saying like um I can't that's the one
thing I like about YouTube is that so
many people will just like assume like
oh you're like this perfect oh you don't
have problems like or oh you're so this
or oh you're so that just because they
see a few minutes of your life every
week and it's like oh my gosh it's just
difficult because everyone doesn't
really understand like all these people
are real people with real beating hearts
with real feelings like we we believe
when we get cut and we have issues just
like you guys we deal with things on a
daily basis and it's hard because like
if I want to open up to you guys and
share what is like I'm going through
there's many people out there they're
gonna be like oh my god you're just
whining you're such a complaint or get
over it you know but if I act like
everything is fine I can smile my face
people be like you're so fake um that's
very difficult I just feel like on
YouTube a lot of people don't let people
be human they don't want to see them as
human they want to see them as like this
picture perfect statue that's just like
a music deity and like that's physically
impossible um that's the one thing I
don't like about YouTube but I feel like
that comes with everything you know I'm
saying I just like YouTube's gotten so
political like when I first started
YouTube it was like sitting infront of
your couch was totally normal with like
a little tiny camera like no big deal
but now everything's so like intense and
like amazing like the lighting is
perfection and the cameras are so
amazing it's like ever
videos such a production is kind of like
keeping up with the Joneses like you
have to feel like you're like in this
rat race like to stay perfect and like
make your videos amazing and I just
personally that's what it's about like I
don't like if you're here on YouTube
making video game videos or comedy
videos or beauty videos like whatever it
may be I think that you should enjoy
what you do and upload your content for
yourself and people like it they like it
if they don't they don't and I just feel
like YouTube is kind of turned into a
thing of like who can be better than the
next and it's like that's crappy that's
not cool
um there's my little rant on YouTube
wasn't expecting that to come out but
there it is
favorite movie oh that's so hard I'm
such a movie watcher you guys that is
like my thing my favorite thing to do is
watch movies like that is that's my
thing so I that's really hard um it
depends like what mood I'm in but just
in general overall if I had to just
choose like one movie in all of life
okay so can't choose one movie but I
would choose a director I would choose a
Nancy Meyers movie which includes father
of the bride the holiday something's got
to give it's complicated all those
movies are Nancy Meyers and she's my
favorite director ever like those movies
right there are my favorite movies of
all time like if I'm having a bad day
sit down glass of wine watch one of
those movies I'm just like those movies
just like they're so good they feed my
soul I love them if you could be one
character from friends who would it be
which character would most accurately
represent you oh gosh that is hard and
you know as like a friends obsessor I
have been in this conversation with many
people before and everyone always tells
me that I am a mix of Rachel Monica and
Phoebe because like I'm all three of
them combined I'm like I'm neurotic like
Monica kind of sassy like Rachel but
then I'm like really quirky and dorky
like Phoebe like I'm all three but if
you like if I had to have to had to pick
one at the end of the day I'm probably
more Monica no Rachel I'm like Monica
sprinkled with Rachel all right so that
completes this question and answer I
hope that you guys enjoyed it I know it
was like super spontaneous and my camera
I'm not joking died five maybe six times
during trying to film this so it was not
it was not as smooth as I was hoping but
that's okay so I hope you guys enjoy and
when I get my new camera in the mail
very soon I will jump back to
mama'll tutorials so until then I hope
you guys like this video thanks for
watching I love you guys and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
