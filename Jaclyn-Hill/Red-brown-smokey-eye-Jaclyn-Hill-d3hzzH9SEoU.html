eye it's red and orange tones it's
really fun and you can go a lot of
different directions with it um I mean I
use like a bunch of colors I think I use
like four or five colors my eyes today
you can just keep it down
to or you can add in yellows and oranges
and like brighter Reds I just I have so
much fun with this and when I used to
work at Mac it was the most popular
smokey eyes I would wear every time I
wear these shades women would come in
asking me to apply it on them I was like
this big joke cuz all the makeup artists
that I worked with would get really
upset when I would come in wearing this
and they would be like what are you
doing to us Jaclyn because everybody
wants these colors because when you look
at them you don't think like Oh orange
Oh yellow Oh red but when you see it put
together it's very wearable I absolutely
love it
for brown eyes I know the I obviously
don't have brown eyes I love it for
brown eyes though I think that the warm
tones with brown eyes just like honey
it's beautiful um it's complimentary to
every eye color though so if you want to
learn how to do this just keep watching
hello everybody so the first thing I'm
doing is priming my eyelids I'm using
Mac's painterly paint-pot um any primer
will be fine it's just beyond necessary
that you use one today because we're
gonna be working with a lot of
eyeshadows you do not want it falling
all over your face um today we're going
to be working out of this palette which
is like my reddish yellow palette
whatever I'm going in with Samoas silk
which is like a yellowy light brown
taking this fluffy brush that you always
see which by the way it was from a
limited collection it was a holiday
collection that's why it's gold
um but yeah I'm just gonna take the SMO
silk and go back and forth and when
she'll wiper motions taking it as far up
as I want this is very important because
once you start going with those dark
colors you're really gonna need a medium
tone color to help blend everything
together otherwise it's just not going
to be cute and you don't want to deal
with that okay
then I'm gonna go in with brown script
which is this dark beautiful red Brown
oh my gosh favorite color I'm going in
with a synthetic brush
you want to use a synthetic brush
because if you go in with a goat
hairbrush the goat hair is going to hold
most of this product and just kind of
push it around and it's not going to be
as pigmented as you see here in this
video so using a synthetic brush I'm
just going up into my crease back and
forth don't be scared to take it up
pretty high because I'm gonna have this
really blown out so I'm not afraid to
get this up near my eyebrow today now
I'm going in with red brick and I'm
going to use a goat hair brush now
because I want this to be more softer
because we're going to start to move
upward and take your time with this you
have to be patient and just go back and
forth back and forth it's gonna take a
little bit of time but you don't want to
just pack product on there otherwise it
can start to look like a big awful mess
so just back and forth with this and
then I'm gonna go back with the first
brush you saw and just blend blend blend
and I go back with this brush probably
three times in the whole process just to
blend it up I'm taking rule now which is
this really pretty like apricot Orange
and I'm just gonna toss that up in there
because as you can see it's kind of a
gradient from like this dark deep round
red and then it's going to go up and you
know it's redder and then fade out on
the orange kind of like fire okay so
cheeseball anyways so yeah you already
saw me do that to my right eye now you
get to watch me do it to my left and
it's just the same thing I wasn't sure
if I should put this in the video but
then I was like you know I don't want to
cut it out because I want you guys to
actually get the point of what it takes
you know not just make it look like oh
I'm fabulous I do my makeup so quick no
honestly today doing my makeup took like
a good 30 minutes 35 minutes out six I
had some technical difficulties with my
lashes um but yeah just working back and
forth in these motions and as you can
see I'm going into that inner tear duct
area and I'm putting a pretty good
amount of product in there because if
you leave that alone especially with
these colors it's gonna look kind of
awkward so you want to bring that color
in like you see
now I'm doing my eyeliner and I'm not
going to show you too much of me doing
my eyeliner because everybody does
eyeliner their own way I'm doing it
pretty thick today I mean more than
pretty thick I'm doing it very thick
today and if you guys want to see a
video how I specifically do my eyeliner
let me know in the comments below
because you know I'm not gonna sit here
and bore you with my eyeliner because
out of the whole process the eyeliner
takes me the longest takes me longer
than anything else that I'm doing so I'm
just throwing it on and moving on
because I really don't want to stay here
and show it to you for an hour but
that's what it looks like and then later
I actually thicken it up even more so
whatever I'm highlighting right
underneath my brow and I'm probably
using the color shroom but I just grab
any color near to me I mean it doesn't
matter you can use it face highlighter
eyeshadow whatever you have just
anything light can go up there now I'm
putting on my foundation and I'm pretty
sure I've mentioned it before but this
is a sigma brush a flat top kabuki and
after using this brush for my foundation
I will never use a different brush for
the rest of my life I don't think I mean
it's like 15 or 16 dollars and it puts
Mac brushes to shame it is so amazing I
even just got my mom one okay I'm doing
my eyebrows now which once again is just
like the eyeliner you know I'm doing it
for you but quickly I'm cutting some
stuff out because eyebrows are a whole
other thing themselves everybody has
different eyebrows everybody does it go
away I'm showing you how I use mine I go
in with the color cork by Mac and should
picture of that yeah um but yeah I just
run one of my eyebrows and then I just
brush it out with a spool to blend it
all together so that it's not like
choppy I brush it out pretty good though
more than I'm showing you here but yeah
I just keep going in there with a spool
over and over and over and it'll help
blend it together so that it doesn't
look choppy I used to do my eyebrows
really choppy before I finally bought
this school and now it's like my life is
completely different
okay concealer i'm going in with nw20 is
the shade and it is select cover-up and
i know it looks like i'm putting like
tons on my face that's oh hey i'm
busting out and singing sorry my husband
was playing music in the background move
up um anyways I'm using this with my
finger so my fingers gonna take some of
the product so it's not gonna put as
much on as you think okay Jacqueline
calm down do your makeup anyways so I'm
using my finger and I'm not doing it
correctly you should be working from the
outer corner of your eyes and our corner
of your eye to prevent creasing I'm just
not even paying attention I'm so
horrible at like being on YouTube okay
I'm going up on the side of my eyes you
can see because I had a lot of that red
coming towards my nose from me just like
slopping my brush around so I was just
cleaning myself up but anyways I'm just
doing the same thing on the other eye
and I should be going for my outer
corner to my inner but I'm not because I
do what I want and now I'm gonna set it
with this translucent powder any
transition powder will work I honestly
do not see the difference in drugstore
translucent powder and like Mac and why
I salt translucent powder it's powder
just use it and I do under my eyes and
on my nose because those are the parts
that I feel like my makeup just slides
right off and this prevents my creasing
in between my eyebrows so wonderful now
I am going in with brown script under my
eyes and I'm going in with a smaller
brush first just to get it tight into my
eyelashes and then I'm going to go in
with a little bit thicker one just to
push it all around and blend it out I
don't want it to be like super tight
down there I want to be kind of fluffy
smoked out now I'm going in with lashes
typical these are red cherry
number 43 I have like 20 of them so
they're the only lashes I use but I am
so picky when it comes to lashes and
these are the only lashes that I am just
like absolutely in love with I think I
can wear them with any look and I'm
happy with them yeah now I'm going in
with bronzer that's give me Sun by Mac
this is a great bronzer if you are not
super white
so yeah I'm just lightly I'm not even
contouring I'm just throwing it on right
underneath my cheekbones side of my face
right on my forehead make sure you get
really good in that hairline because you
don't want to see the line in between
your hair your bronzer um
yeah I'm not really contouring I'm just
throwing it in there however and then
I'm going in with the blush peaches by
Mac and I'm going in on the apples of my
cheeks and blending it upward I might
love this color blush with this
eyeshadow is so complimentary I okay but
seriously it's so pretty I love it and
then I'm putting a highlighter on my
cheek any highlighter I think I use soft
and gentle you can use absolutely
anything though doesn't matter I'm going
in with the fairy Glenn lipstick which
was a limited edition for my two years
ago but it's my favorite nude ever not
too nude it's just perfect
highlighting my Cupid's bow just to
bring a little bit more attention to my
new lips because I don't like your lips
to fall away from the makeup and then
I'm just touching that same highlight
just on my nose growl gel the most
important thing oh hello John that's my
husband
um yes keeping my eyebrows in place
because I do not need the flyways I
think it's the most important part of
your look even if I'm doing like a
natural day I like just using clear brow
gel otherwise my eyebrows are all over
the place okay I look very confused and
concerned okay anyways a little bit of
mascara on the bottom eyelashes I don't
like to neglect my bottom eyelashes just
because they're really long and I think
if I don't use mascara you can see the
eye shadow on them and it just looks
weird so I always do a little bit of
mascara down there but you do not have
to by any means the look will look
complete without it and I'm touching a
mascara under my false lashes just to
complete the look and make it look more
natural and that's it the look is done
so
