a Rihanna inspired makeup tutorial this
makeup look is based off of the look
that she was wearing at the CFDA Awards
and I know her dress was very
controversial to say the least but I
honestly could not get over her face
shields so gorgeous her makeup was so on
point
I mean Rihanna is pretty much always on
point for the past six months to year
she has just been everything her fashion
her makeup her hair she has just been
amazing I mean the girl is so beautiful
it's going to take a lot to make her not
look perfect hello it's Rihanna but I
saw the pictures of her makeup and I was
just like okay yes now it's happening I
just thought it was so beautiful
so this tutorial is not using the exact
products that her makeup artists used I
honestly didn't investigate to see if I
could maybe find out the exact products
I just looked at a few pictures felt
inspired loved it and so this is my
version of the Rihanna
makeup look that she wore not be exactly
how to if that makes sense
so yeah if you guys like this video you
like the idea of me doing celebrity
inspired makeup books and give this
video a thumbs up and leave me a comment
down below letting me know who you would
like to see or you can tweet me or
Instagram me pictures of something that
you would like to see but I had a thing
with the sound of a fun idea and I can
do an inspired celebrity makeup look
maybe once a month or so I honestly like
the challenge so you guys send me
pictures of people who look nothing like
me with gorgeous makeup it sounds like a
good time so let me know how you guys
feel about it in the comments again as
always thank you for watching I love you
so much I hope you enjoy the video and
I'll see you soon bye my nose is still
burnt and now peeling from earlier this
weekend not cute use your waterproof
sunblock this is the picture that I am
gathering my inspiration from and the
first thing we're going to want to do is
take a shade like Peach Smoothie by
makeup geek this is a very beautiful
warm shade it's got a little bit of
peach and a little bit of yellow
undertones in it it's very warm and it's
very light so we're going to take an e
40 by Sigma and buff that all the way
from inner corner to outer corner we
want this to be just as pigmented in the
inner corner as we do in the outer since
this is a smokey eye it's not a cat eye
make sure you are distributing it evenly
then we're going to go in with Mac
saddle this is such a gorgeous warm
mid-tone Brown it is perfect and ideal
for doing a smoky eye like this I am
using an e 25 by Sigma again and I'm
just going to buff that really do
Blee into that crease make sure that you
get this color deep in that inner socket
of the eye because that will really come
in handy once you go in with the next
steps then again going back with a clean
brush and just buffing that out if you
buff everything out every step of the
way you'll never have harsh lines when
creating a smoky eye then we're going to
go in with mac cosmetics night divine
this is a beautiful deep silver color it
has some shimmer in it and it almost
looks like a steel blue but yet it
doesn't so using an e 55 I'm just going
to pack that all over the lid make sure
you really get that generous in the
inner corner Rhianna really has that
pushed up tight in that inner corner of
her eye she doesn't keep it low so make
sure you really blend that out I have a
little bit of saddle on this brush from
before and I'm just going to use that to
blend blend blend then we're going to go
in with typographic this again is by mac
cosmetics it's a great matte gray so
using that e 25 brush I'm just going to
buff this all over that outer corner and
not bring it anywhere past that crease
you just want to dig it right in that
socket of the eye but you don't want to
extend it just push it in there and
windshield wiper motions it's a very
creamy shadow it's very easy to blend
and then once you have that on that
whole outer corner portion of the eye
then you can go back with the original
brush that you had saddle on and again
windshield wiper motions back and forth
and this will just blend it out if you
blend every step of the way you'll never
have harsh lines so remember every time
you add a color blend it out then we're
going to go in with Mac Carbon any black
will do this is just what I had sitting
right in front of me with a pencil brush
I'm just going to put this in the outer
corner of my lid you almost want to make
a sideways V shape starting at the lash
line going up to the corner of the eye
and then up into that crease as you can
see me doing this isn't going to make an
insane difference it's just going to add
a little bit more dimension a little bit
more depth and make it look a little bit
more smoky so once you have that packed
on then you can go back with that same
brush again and like I've said blend
windshield wiper motions see blend blend
blend then we're going to go in with Too
Faced shadow insurance glitter glue
we're going to just dab this on the eye
area I recommend using your fingers for
this just because it's the easiest way
to do it as long as your fingers are
clean then we're going to go in with Mac
press pigment in the shade jet couture
as you can see it is a very dark sparkly
color and with my fingers I'm going to
dab this on the lid Mac action
suggests using your fingers when doing
this believe it or not because it really
does work the best
so skip a brush and just use the tools
that God gave us all and I'm just going
to Pat that on the inner corner of the
lid and bada bing done then I'm going to
grab a q-tip and your favorite eye cream
and just clean up under the eyes because
using grays and blacks and glitters they
always tend to fall and using an eye
cream will make everything go on
smoother anyways and moisturize the
under area under eye area so it's like
bonus I'm going to just go ahead and
coat my lashes with any mascara it's
really not that big of a deal because
we're going to cover it with falsies I'm
using my favorite lashes of life these
are the velour wispy sweet-nothings
Rihanna had lashes on very similar to
this that were full all the way from
inner to outer corner they weren't
really cat eye lashes so it's another
excuse to use my faves I am using
tweezers to apply these be careful when
you're doing it at home then I'm going
to go in with Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation and Mac face and body
foundation I am using a shade 5.75 in
George Romani and c3 and Mac for those
of you who are curious using a sigma
flat top f80 kabuki brush I'm going to
just go and circular motions and press
this into my skin all over the face now
once I get to my nose it is going to be
a little bit tricky because it's peeling
and it's burnt and it doesn't feel good
and it's not Q and it hurts a little bit
too I'm now going to conceal my under
eye area using mac cosmetics Pro
Longwear concealer I am NOT going to
make my under eye area to highlight it
because Rihanna did have a subtle
highlight under there but nothing too
intense so I am going to bring that from
inner corner and drag it back towards my
temple using a sigma f80 6 i'm just
going to press this into the skin and
buff it backward it's going to give the
face a little bit more lift and height
and make you look a little bit more
sculpted and then of course try to cover
up that burn on the nose even more then
I'm going to go in and fill in my brows
you guys have seen this before we're
going to move pretty quickly through
this as always I am using the Anastasia
brow Wiz though and I will list the
links and all the products down below
that I'm using such as this as always
but once we have those brows done we can
then move on I am then going to set my
under eye concealer I'm using the shade
emphasized this is a Mac Pro powder and
I'm also using a little bit of the
banana color in the Anastasia contour
I'm high maintenance I need two
different powders to set my under eye
concealer don't judge me
once you start you can't stop at the
problem taking that same Mac Pro
emphasize powder that we use to set the
concealer I'm going to just put that
underneath the brow right on that brow
bone for a little bit of a subtle
highlight Rihanna did not have a
shimmery highlight so this will do the
perfect job then of course taking a
clean blending brush just go in there
when she'll wiper motions to make sure
it's all blended and seamless then we're
going to take any pencil brush I mix
Peach Smoothie and saddle together the
same shades that we use in the upper
crease and I'm going to buff that from
inner corner all the way to outer corner
this will make sure that when we go with
these darker colors were like I am right
now a typographic that it's all going to
look very buffed out and seamless going
in with that brown shade first will
really make sure that it looks perfect
as you continue to blend so I'm just
blending out typographic with that same
pencil brush going back and forth and
then I'm going to go in with night
divine again this will really tie the
upper lid to the lower lid I'll look
like this you really want it to look
like it's wrapped around the entire eye
so you want to put that night divine in
the inner corner and then you want to
put that dark grey and that black in the
outer corner if you take it step-by-step
I promise you won't look like a panda
and then once you have that make sure
again you blend as you can see I will
take this pencil brush and go up around
the side of my eye almost like a
circular motion just to blend the
corners out so that again it all comes
together and really makes it look like a
blown out smoky eye then I'm gonna go in
with makeup geek ice queen and highlight
the inner corners she had a beautiful
highlight on the inner corner and it was
kind of dusted and swept in to that
silver that she had happening so I'm
going to do the exact same thing this is
an intense highlight so I'm not going in
to generous leaks I don't want it to be
like boom icicles then using Mac smolder
this is a creamy coal pencil any coal
pencil will do L'Oreal has a great one
I'm going to rim the entire waterline
top and bottom all the way to inner
corner I know it looks so freaky but
this is what she did and it's just going
to bring that look together if you feel
like you have very small eyes you might
want to avoid doing that it's just going
to make the look even more dramatic and
smoky I'm using mac gigablack lash my
favorite lower lash mascara just to coat
those lashes so that it completes the
eye look then I'm going to bronze
I'm not going to contour I'm just going
to
so using a big fat brush I'm going to go
in with Mac care blend press powder and
the shade medium dark and I'm going to
bronze all along that cheek area and
then do not neglect your forehead when
you're bronzing your cheeks it's always
good to just go ahead and bronze your
forehead and the bottom of your chin
because it'll make it look much more
natural then we're going to go in with a
makeup geek blush oh I am very excited
about this palette these blushes come
out next week I will let you know soon
as they launch they are amazing and I
cannot wait for you guys to try them I
have been having a blast playing with in
the past couple days I did use the shade
infatuation in case you were curious
then I'm going to go in with a matte
lipstick and I don't remember the name
and I'm sorry but I will have it in the
description box right below this video
along with everything else I love that
Rihanna did a like mid-tone pinky brown
nude instead of just a wiped out pale
nude I thought that it just tied this
look together even more it's beautiful I
finished it off with bite Beauty
rambutan and then I'm going to go ahead
and just spray the face with Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray and you're
done I hope you guys enjoyed this video
