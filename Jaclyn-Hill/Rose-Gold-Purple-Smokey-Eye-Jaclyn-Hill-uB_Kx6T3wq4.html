today's video I'm going to be doing a
makeup tutorial on this look that just
co-writes Here I am just like in a good
mood right now because this backdrop is
just giving me it's giving me some sort
of vibe I'm very into I don't know if
I've ever even filled with a purple
sparkly backdrop before but I was like I
think it's very appropriate for this
look I actually just started playing
with makeup earlier today because I got
a new palette in the mail and I got my
dog is snoring so much behind the camera
I'm sorry but I got a new palette in the
mail today um the three 5:02 and I'll
just like I have to play with this I
play with it yesterday and I had to play
that again today and I just have like
this fun look in mine so I was kind of
like was messing around that turned into
like a full glam look and then I got on
the snapchat and I was immediately blown
up with her quest to film a video on
this look so I thought I have to do it
now it's either Now or Never for me but
I'm just obsessed with this look I can't
stop looking at in the viewfinder
because it's like rose gold to purple to
like orange and copper like I just I I
love love what's happening on my eyes
right now so I hope that you guys enjoy
this for everyone who requested it thank
you so much for watching don't forget it
in this video like I'm gonna be using
all different eyeshadows different
palettes but you do not have to use
exactly what I am using this is what
inspired me Musa the palette that I
wanted to use but you guys can use any
to have at home I'm pretty sure I say
that in the tutorial as well tutorial I
hope that you enjoy thank you for
watching and make sure that you give
this video a thumbs up subscribe let me
know how you feel want the glitter
backdrops because I know some people
can't stand them some people love them I
bring them come I like let them come and
go you know sometimes it's a natural
backdrop sometimes it's the glitter
backdrop but I'm into this purple right
now I'm having a moment that's it just
cut me off I love you and enjoy the
tutorial so the first thing I do is I'm
gonna grab this new morphe palette right
here this is the 3 502 I know a lot of
people tend to complain in my videos
when I use morphe palettes but it's
difficult for me because I have such a
huge request to use their palettes but
then when I upload videos using them I
have a lot of people that are
disappointed so please keep in mind if
you're someone who doesn't want to
purchase a morphe palette for whatever
reason and you don't want to buy this
palette and recreate the stuff that I'm
doing today you can recreate this look
with any palette or any a Shou that you
anytime I ever use anything here on my
channel you guys do not feel like you
have to go with the exact same thing you
can recreate this with whatever you have
at home with that being said I'm gonna
pick up the first shade and the third
shade in the palette these two right
here it's gonna mix those together on a
fluffy brush okay I have a hocus-pocus
playing my iPad right now and it's so
hard I'm just like stop and focus on it
like all right so it's gonna go ahead
and put that right in the crease of the
eye and start buffing at that outward if
you don't have a defined crease that's
the beauty of makeup you can create a
crease for yourself just do the exact
same motions and your makeup will turn
out pretty and if you want to make this
super pigment sit on the inner core of
the eye you could you could turn this
into a hey little look and make it super
pigmented in here as well I'm not gonna
get crazy pigmented in there like as the
product is leaving my brush I'm trying
to lightly bring it in there but I want
the outer corner to be a little bit more
intense than my inner corner okay now
I'm gonna take this shade right here in
the second row second one and it's like
a really deep kind of poopy brown color
but I love it I love you some poopy and
some pukey browns I'm just gonna put
that right over top of what we just did
and that our owner in that outer crease
area mmm and make sure after applying
every color when you basically have
nothing left on your brush you always
like just bring that upward and make
sure that everything is really blended
together all right I'm gonna use some
translucent powder and carve this out I
do this in every single video so I don't
know if like I should explain myself
really any more why I'm doing this
because it's just getting redundant I
just changed the angle on my camera
because I felt like it was like looking
down on me and you guys can't really see
what I was doing so hopefully you guys
can see what I'm doing better now all
right now I'm gonna grab this Bordas
orange shade right here in the very
center of the palette and now I'm gonna
take that and put that right over top
again for me makeup especially a smoky
eye is all about layering I don't even
know what I mean when I say especially a
smoky eye I feel like that same way with
my face like when it comes like primer
and then like foundation and concealer
and then just like a little bit of
powder here and powder under the eyes
like I think that you're gonna get the
best results when you layer makeup so if
you're ever wondering why I go in with
like 15 different shades in the outer
corner
like at the end you get such a blended
beautiful blown out flawless effect that
that's why I take those steps every
single time I mean he should I bring
that color all the way down to that
translucent powder and if I wipe a
little bit of the way that's okay
because I can just take the brush and go
right back and just clean it up all
right I'm going to go back with those
first two shades I use in the very
beginning on the brush just because now
that I have that darker color on I want
to really make sure that it's totally
blended out so just with a little bit of
those first two shades we're gonna go
over the edges of what I just did I'm
still using the exact same brush that I
started off with I have not changed that
yet all right so now I'm gonna grab this
gorgeous like intense hot kind of pinky
red shade I'm gonna mix it with this
orange shade in the center that I've
been using just because this all by
itself is gonna be a little bit too pink
for the look that I'm going for so
mixing it and combining it with this one
it's gonna make it a little bit more of
like a terracotta red and not as much of
like a pink red and I'm switching it out
for a little bit of a smaller brush
right now we're just gonna put that
right deep there in the crease area and
just bring it over this way and like a
rainbow windshield wiper motions all
right so now I'm gonna dip into my
pallet sorry this one is so dirty right
now I'm gonna go on with the shade hunty
right here like that really orange and
Ted's kind of like brick red I'm gonna
take a little bit of that and just
deepen this area
all right so now I'm gonna go in with
this really intense shimmery pink shade
right here it has like a little bit of
other shadow on excels playing with it
earlier I'm gonna take that I'm just a
flat brush like this one right here this
is a Mac 248 why I just yeah 242 I gave
my brush just a little bit of spray with
some mac fix+
so that it goes on really really easy
and metallic and I'm going to just dab
this all over the lid
gosh this color is so awesome and you
can see when you spray the brush with
some fix+ like you don't even have to
swipe like you don't have to do anything
you just like barely Pat and the product
is just gonna go right under the lid so
easily so now I'm gonna grab my pallet
and I'm gonna go in with the shade
royalty right here which is this purple
that basically perfectly matches my
background and then with the purple it's
gonna go right over top of that entire
lid I just wanted to lay that pink down
first as a base because I wanted it to
kind of like shine through the purple
you know I'm saying I'm just gonna Pat
this all over the place definitely the
heaviest metals pigmented low down by
the lashline where I'm at right now
and then as we get higher I will go in
with less product and kind of let it
fade out a little bit just kind of move
it around in to that first shade that we
put on the lid ok so then I'm going to
grab this a for a pro palette this one
right here does the editorial one it's
full of so many vibrant and gorgeous
like intense pops of color I'm gonna
take this matte purple right here it's
like a kind of a deeper lilac almost I'm
gonna mix that with the shade Sodapop
from my palette which is the super super
dark purple right here that almost looks
like a blackish like deep brown but it
is purple it's gonna mix those two
shades together and then it's gonna go
right there in the crease with both of
those shades and then just kind of marry
that lid color in that transition color
together
I'm gonna put this powder on my under
eye area since I'm starting to blend I
don't want to have a bunch of fallout
and ruin my foundation all right face
powder at all I'm gonna go in with that
exact same purple shade I've been
working with from the Sephora Pro
palette I'm like a much tiny smaller
blending brush I'm gonna take just a
little bit of that and bring it into
this area I actually like to have a
brush even smaller than this but my are
dirty right now and I don't want to go
with a dirty brush so I'm gonna just use
it this one I'm gonna dip back in it's
that matte warm shade right there in the
morphe palette and just really really
lightly I'm going to go right over the
edge of that purple with that orange
just to kind of bring it all together
because I don't want it to be like a
harsh stop with that purple eyeshadow
you know okay so now I'm gonna go in
with this gorgeous like a rose gold look
at my nails they're covered in powder
this gorgeous rose gold shade right here
in the palette like this is one of my
favorite shimmers in the palette just
like speaks to me and I love the idea of
putting it over a purple I just think it
looks gorgeous together it's such a
pretty color or top of this I love
because it kind of like complements the
crease color and the purple just kind of
brings it all together and makes it one
I'm just putting it right there in the
center and then just really subtly
blending it out okay so I'm gonna go
back in with the matte warms right here
from the morphe palette and i'm also
gonna grab the shade hunty from my
palette which is right here I'm gonna
mix those two shades together equally on
a pencil brush and just blend it out on
my lower lash line I'm gonna go in with
Sodapop right here on the very bottom
again not matte and deep purple
I'm gonna take some gel liner this is
the Maybelline eye studio in the shade
blackest black or just a little brush
any brush will do I'm gonna pop this in
my inner waterline right there on my
lower lash okay I'm gonna go back in
with that really intense Matt already
pink right here I'm gonna mix it with a
little bit of this one as well you know
me I'm always mixing colors from
palettes it's like when I have an entire
palette stay in front of me I don't
wanna just be limits it's using like one
color I haven't dipped my brush into
like two or three every single time I'm
gonna mix a little bit of those tips I
don't want to be too intentional like
dull it down a little bit with that
color and I'm gonna go right over top of
that purple and blend it all together
I'm gonna go in with the first color in
my palette right here this is the shade
and light and I was going to pop that on
the inner corner of my eye for a little
highlight you know how I do I'm gonna
all right so now I'm gonna do my brows
really quickly like I say really quickly
this is gonna take at least five minutes
okay so now that my brows are done and
looking very full if I might add
I just personally feel like no Iowa is
ever complete without lower mascara like
even if you have a really short lower
lashes I don't know I just feel I can
make such a big difference it's like
when you do your eyeshadow like so much
powder just gets all over your lashes
from the shadows and even if you have
like little tiny stumpy lashes like I
just feel like it blackens them up and
just helps out the look in general
okay I'm gonna contour my cheeks really
quickly I'm using the Kat Von D the ever
so dirty Kat Von D shade + light contour
palette right here I'm gonna go in about
middle shade and just lightly sculpt out
my cheekbones
and then I'm actually going to grab a
little bronzer as well and just go or
talk about contour and warm up my face
especially with a look like this like
when I have like a smoky eye that has
any warmth in it I really took warm up
my face a lot so that it looks nice and
even and like everything just kind of
comes together and I am really fair
right now like my spray tan has faded so
much so I want to warm up my skin a
little bit to complement the eyes I'm
gonna go in with a little blush I'm
gonna be using makeup geek summer fling
it's like this light peachy coral right
here
let's I'm gonna take this NARS
highlighting palette right here these
highlights are still beautiful highlight
and a bronzer I'm going to take these
two lightest ones in the palette and go
ahead and just highlight the cheekbone
area
I'm gonna take that on my Cupid's bow I
have like a little blemish right there
on my chin so I'm not gonna highlight
too much there I'm gonna take that
lightest shade in the highlight palette
I'm gonna just put that right underneath
of my brow as a brow highlight realize I
forgot to contour my nose and that is
unacceptable so I'm gonna just go ahead
and grab the kat von d palette again
with that middle shade and just get to
contouring this bad boy
can we just wipe this off
goodbye okay my nose contour looks crazy
and then you find her it's completely
normal on person though who knows how
it's gonna look on camera cuz in the
viewfinder it looks bad but in person it
looks very natural so I think we're
gonna do a really a pale nude lip today
which I have not done in such a long
time I think it's a look just kind of
calls for I've been obsessing these
hourglass lipsticks recently and this is
the shade I wish and this is the shade
one day I was gonna spray Liberty
setting spray on my face
to just seal the deal or here just a
little bit are you guys so that is it
for this video I hope that you enjoy and
this a makeup tutorial that you see

have done purple so I'm really glad that
