hey guys so today I am going to be doing
a makeup tutorial for you I wanted to do
something random and my hubby is calling
me I wanted to do something fun and
colorful and outside the box and on
trend for spring because I am over
winter I'm over sweatpants I'm over
gaining weight I'm over at all and I am
on for the spring trends and ready to
move to the next season so I wanted to
do something colorful that is universal
and is going to complement a lot of you
but yet surprise you because I feel like
everything I do colorful here on my
channel is incorporating purples because
everyone wants to wear Purple's because
they feel like it's the only color they
can wear that won't make them look like
a clown but that's not true it's all
about technique it's all about how much
you're applying where you're applying
and what you are wearing on your body
for instance if you can tell and wearing
neutrals with just pops of color and my
accessories if you can see I have green
bracelets and then green and blue and my
earrings this is like the most common or
anything complementary thing you can do
for coral and pinky and red and orange
II eyes is wearing something like blue
and turquoise and green and your
accessories or your clothing matching
your eye looks or your lip colors to
your clothing is going to do the exact
opposite and it's not going to
complement you and it's going to be a
little overkill it's going to reverse
what you're trying to do so instead of
wearing the same color on your body that
you have on your face try to write the
opposite color because as you can tell
when I bring my bracelets on screen
what's on me that's a scarf when I bring
my bracelets on screen you're going to
see that it's going to make my eyes pop
more because it's going to compliment
the shadow that I have going on I hope
that makes sense it's just a quick side
note because a lot of people big this
doesn't work on me but it's because
you're wearing an orange t-shirt and
you're wearing orange on your eyes and
that's just too much so try to do the
opposite on your body and that tip will
take you far trust me okay quickly I
just want to bring this to YouTube's
attention all of you guys um yesterday
my account here on YouTube was
terminated YouTube deleted my channel
for six hours and it was
the worst thing in the entire world for
those of you who don't know what I'm
talking about I'm very glad didn't have
to be a part of it because it was awful
um it was a mistake it was a
misunderstanding I got it back he was
gone for six hours it was a war six
hours pretty much of my entire life I'm
not even kidding I had everybody on top
of it I I was in front of my computer
and on my phone and using my husband's
phone while my husband was sitting there
next to me like it's gonna be okay
Jacqueline and my best friend on his
computer and his phone I had my mom
taking care of stuff I had my sister
informed like everybody I was emailing
and calling every single person I knew
texting every single person I knew thank
you to candy Johnson Thank You Kenny
Johnson was so sweet
so supportive so encouraging and just
amazing like I can't believe I'm talking
about Kenny Johnson right now I can't
record numbers even in my phone like I
have been a candy fangirl for five years
oh my god yes and I didn't know who I am
like oh my god candy Johnson but
seriously like candy you are the
sweetest woman ever I love you so much
I you're just the sweetest I love you I
just want to say a true thank you to

greenback Jacqueline and so many of you
were telling me that you know you're not
just my fans or my family you'll follow
me anywhere ah I love you guys so much
and so when I got my youtube back I
cried so hard I sobbed like I saw my
husband told me he's never seen me cry
that hard in my life and I'm not a crier
I don't cry easy but I bawled my eyes
out like a baby like it was and I could
right now because I'm just I'm so
grateful to have money to back I'm so

the world it's crazy how life changes
you know at one point I'm homeschooled
and no one wants to be my friend

and thousands of people are Tania's are
crying so it's like ah I love you guys
you guys make me feel like I have a
place and I hope that I do the same for
you so I love you and I hope you enjoyed
this makeup tutorial we're gonna do
something fun and glittery and colorful
to celebrate me still being here on
YouTube thank you God and thank you
YouTube I love you guys I'll see you
soon bye we are starting off with a
fresh face and no makeup so let's do
this first and foremost as always we are
going to start off by priming our eyes I
am using Mac Pro Longwear concealer in
shade nw20 this concealer was made with
a technology to help prime your eyes for
shadow so use it it's the bomb calm then
going in with makeup geek eyeshadow and
Peach Smoothie one of my all-time
favorite transition shades it's got a
little bit of a yellow undertone in it
so it really works on any skin tone that
has some olive in it and once you have
put that in your crease all the way from
inner corner to outer corner okay don't
fall asleep Jacqueline and you have just
a little bit left on your brush start
blending upward towards the brow and
this will really help in the blending
process then going in with makeup geek
Mango Tango this beautiful peach color
so gorgeous going in with an e25 brush
which is just a smaller denser goat hair
version of the e-40 so you can really
get in there much more precisely again
take your time doing this and just move
from inner corner all the way to outer
corner doesn't matter how much of this
you get on your lid you're just really
focusing on your crease the literally
doesn't matter so just keep blending
upward the less product you have on your
brush the more upward towards the brow
you want to move then going in with
Razzleberry oh I just love the name from
this eyeshadow I just want to talk about
all day okay so the exact same a25 we're
going to put razzle berry all the way
from our inner corner to our outer
corner as you can see I'm not focusing
on blending this beautifully on the lid
but we are focusing on the crease so
just like I said before make sure you
get this densely in the crease all the
way from the inner socket to the outer
corner of the eye and then blend up then
going in with Too Faced shadow insurance
glitter glue this is going to save
everyone's life who works with glitters
or pigments or anything chunky that has
fall out tap on the back of your hand
tap it all over the area that you're
going to place any pigment or glitter
and then go in and watch the magic
fold I'm using Mac Rose pigment it's a
beautiful true rose shade this is an
oldie but a goodie in the Mac world and
using a Mac 242 brush which the only
reason I'm really using this is because
all my e55 s are dirty I need to wash my
brushes very badly and you know it's a
dreaded job I'm just going to pack this
all over the lid to make sure that we
don't have fallout all over our black
eyeliner that we're going to apply go
back and forth and rub like you see me
doing that will make it so if you have
any fallout it's going to fall right now
and not later throughout the night so
pack Pat it on and then rub back and
forth I'm telling you the Too Faced
shadow insurance glitter glue life
Savior when it comes to keeping on that
pigment then using Maybelline gel liner
and blackest black I'm going to put on a
pretty thick band of liner for looks
like this I recommend doing as thick as
you are comfortable within your liner
because when you're using a color like
pink it can easily become looking like
an infection so when you do a thick band
of black liner it's really going to
separate and it's going to make it look
more like a beautiful eye look and not
pinkeye okay who I talked too much I
have on velour lashes and I use lash in
the city and now I'm going in with NARS
and sheer glow foundation in Punjab that
is the shade that I am using
specifically and I'm just going to
breeze through this because I talk about
my foundation and the f80 brush away too
much then I'm filling in my brows with
the Anastasia brow Wiz in the shade what
is the shade is this ash blonde in the
inner corner and then caramel on the
outer tail then I'm going to just sculpt
my brows because I just want to clean
them up a little bit and make them more
precise I do have a video I'll link down
below where I talk when you too much
about my brows you guys can go watch an
in-depth tutorial on that if you're
curious how I achieve this exact brow
then going in with the Mac Pro Longwear
again and shade nw20 I'm just going to
tap this with my finger inner corner
down and upside down triangle all the
way up making the concealer face that we
all have to is our mouth hanging open
and just going back towards my temple I
always use the Sigma F 86 for this which
technically isn't a concealer brush but
the reason I'm not using it today is
because again it's dirty then I'm going
in with the Anastasia contour
palate using that yellow banana shade
and mixing it with Mac Pro emphasized
shaping powder using a sigma tapered
highlighter brush I'm going to just dust
this all under that eye area I always
suggest patting it on first and then
swiping it afterwards this is just going
to make it look the most airbrushed when
applying these specific products using
this specific brush then I'm going to
tap it in the middle of my forehead
bring it down a little bit on the bridge
of my nose Cupid's bow and tap it on the
chin just for a natural highlight then
we're going in with makeup forever
bronzer and number 20 and we're going to
contour as always with the NARS eita
brush we are focusing our contour today
on the outer portion of our face back by
our ears and on our temples and then we
will just slowly blend this inward but
we don't want anything harsh because our
eyes are really calling the attention
with this pop of glittery pink so just
make sure you blend blend blend blend
blend and then blend some more when it
comes to your contour oh that rhymed
points then we are using Clinique's
new blush this is pretty much the same
shade as what's going on with my eyes
which is fine because if you match your
blush you want to do a little bit
something different with your lips so
we're matching our blush and then we'll
do a little something lighter with our
lip color and I'm using a Mac 129
short-handled brush just to blend this
backward in with my contour and just
buff it out then we're going in with the
balm Cindy Luminizer this is a new
highlighting powder by then it's just
like the mary lou manizer but it's
Pinker as you can see and it almost has
this pearly acid like pearlescent lilac
undertone to it or it's like a purpley
pink and it's beautiful for spring and
it will look good on so many different
skin tones this was my second time using
it and I absolutely love it you can see
I just yeah I'm expressing how much I
love it that's the way I do that for you
and then I'm going to go in using any
pencil brush and Mango Tango again by
makeup geek from inner corner to outer
corner and just make sure you keep
blending this under-eye area can quickly
become a hot mess because you don't
blend I assure you if you just keep
working and blend blend blend blend
blend it will end up looking perfect
like everyone wants it to then going in
with razzle berry again I'm using a
makeup geek brush I believe this is just
called the pencil brush and I love
because it's super tiny and easy to get
in those hard-to-reach spots on your
eyes so not everyone's going to want to
put pink underneath their eye you could
just do the Mango Tango or you could go
in with a purple or you could go in with
a dark brown I wanted to do the pink
though just to make this look more fun
then using nylon eyeshadow by Mac I'm
going to pop that in my inner corner to
highlight this is a very intense
highlight it's also beautiful on the
brow bone and the cheekbones just make
sure you don't use too much now I'm
using Rimmel lash accelerator on my
bottom lashes just to complete the eyes
please leave me your suggestions to your
favorite lower lash mascara down below
because I'm on the hunt for a new one
then using dose of color a lipstick in
the shade angelic this is a nice creamy
orange shade I'm going to just apply
this all over the lip but we're not
going to stop there we're also going to
go in with dose of color cotton candy I
didn't realize that this was a dose of
color day mixing these two together is
going to create a tone down version of
our eye look it's not going to be too
pink or too orange or too bright so it's
like that perfect soft almost nude color
to complement what we have going on our
eyes our cheeks so I really hope that
you guys enjoy this video I love you
guys so much and as always I'll see you
soon bite
