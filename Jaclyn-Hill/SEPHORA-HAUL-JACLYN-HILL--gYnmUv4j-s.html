background I'm still sitting in the
exact same room as always but I took the
time to order oh girl my hair is not
that nother level anyways we'll get to
that in a minute I took the time to
order like a professional backdrop setup
and some actual backdrops and lighting
and all that jazz I feel so like fancy
except not really because her I
literally didn't do my hair today
today's video is going to be ice if you
don't already know from the title I went
to Candyland my happy place these new
bags though like I haven't been to
Sephora in so long last time I was at
Sephora is last minute a Sephora haul
which was months ago so yeah it's been a
long time and they like revamped their
stuff like their new bags and like my
Sephora has like a whole new layout it
just seems so like luxurious so before
jumping in the video I just want to
quickly talk about something that
everybody in my life keeps tiny not to
talk about everyone's like just don't
talk about it just let it go Jacqueline
but like I don't know why I always
listen to everyone else telling me what
to do cuz that's never been Who I am but
sometimes I let people get into my head
and this is what I do like this is my
channel and I'm a woman and I like to
talk about things like I can't help it I
talk that's what I do and I just feel
like I've built a friendship and a trust
here on YouTube with you guys my
subscribers and I don't want to not talk
about things you know
so anyways I'm sure you guys tones of
you saw the snapchat that I did
addressing the whole eyeshadow palette
on the becca cosmetics and I release
together for the champagne collection
and I just basically wanted to get her
on YouTube and tell you guys how sorry I
am for this entire situation we decided
to pull the entire palette so it's no
longer available on the website and it's
not been released in stores because of
the fact that they were extremely
inconsistent that could tried a new lab
that came very highly recommended to
them and by other big brands and they
thought that it was gonna be amazing I
just want to say how sorry I am to those
of you who got a bad I shadow palette
who got a bad batch like it really has
been awful just to go through this
process and I'm not talking to the
haters out there I know there's people
out there who are like just waiting for
me to fail waiting for me to
so they can kick me while I'm down I get
it like those people it doesn't matter
what they say I don't care I can delete
block and move on I'm talking to the
people who actually like love me and
watch my videos because they want to
hang out with me and they trust me and
to you that's who I'm speaking to when I
look into the camera always and if I
anyway have made you doubt me thinking
that I'm shady or doing this for any
other reason whatever it may be like I
just want to say how sorry I am to you
this was just a mess that didn't come
from any evil nasty money-hungry place
whatsoever and I am so beyond sorry to
you guys and I
I take accountability from my part in
the collaboration and that's why I
called them begging him to pull the
palette because once I saw that they
were inconsistent and started finding
out the reasons I was like gotta go and
the fact that Becca just without
question was like okay yeah let's pull
it let's do it I was honestly shocked I
did not expect it to be like that
because most brands out there honestly
you guys all they care about is money
they're like well bitch we went ahead we
paid the money we made it we're gonna
make the money back so sorry you're
gonna deal with it that's how most
brands that's how most businesses in the
world work and the fact that Becca was
just like understanding and like yeah we
don't want our name on this either it's
inconsistent it's not good quality they
release an apology about it and it's
like that honestly like made me kind of
reef all in love with Becca
and made me like remember why I start
working with them in the first place
because they are such good people I just
want to say from my end you know I I'm
sorry and I love you guys and I believe
that respect is not given I believe that
in respect to something you have to earn
and if I lost any of your respect I will
work very very hard at earning that
respect back and I'm a very hard worker
so look we'll get there we'll get there
again um so yeah that is basically it I
just wanted to bring it up to you guys
because I don't know I still want to sit
here and act like Owens in a hump and
like it did happen and it sucked and I
know it in like the big picture it's
just I shadow I get it there's so many
people are leaving comments it's like oh
my god it's just eyeshadow and I get it
you can go get full refunds send it back
walk into your local Sephora but still
like it's my integrity and my integrity
is everything to me you know
everything and so that's that I just
want to say I love you and I'm sorry and
thank you to all those who have just
been supportive and cool so yeah let's
go ahead and finally jump into this big
old bag of stuff cuz I did some damage
I've take off my jacket
I put August I was so cold and this
thing second my throat I was so cold and
now I'm like boiling hot I feel so like
summertime that's my summertime dance
sorry scar like get that shoulder
highlight on fleek real quick okay now
we can move on I never put the wave ever
this year wave you'll see it yes
Jacqueline take it quickly what's in a
bag of magic mysteries okay that Birkin
that I got so gonna bust in a box book
whatever the product will still work
this is my fresh and it's called the
sake bath it's with ginger root X
extract the reason that I got this is
because my friend Jackie while shopping
with she has talked about this for like
literally two years and it's pretty
expensive it actually very expensive for
like a bath product and she has been
convincing me to get this because she
says that when you use this in your bath
you feel like you just had like a couple
glasses of wine like it's so incredibly
relaxing apparently pregnant women can't
even use it I'm like what I'm kind of
nervous to use this I'm like wait am I
gonna do drunk cuz I don't like feeling
drunk like I'm such a control freak but
yeah so I bought this because she
convinced me cuz I love taking baths so
much like I'll put on my Michael Buble
Pandora I'll like all my candles I'll
have bubbles overflowing else there with
a glass of wine or sometimes I'll have
my iPad I'll watch a good movie like I
love love the bathtub exfoliating and
shaving the whole process I'm obsessed
so she told me that I need this in my
life so I'll report back guys buying on
snapchat one night like I used the sake
bath you'll know you'll know actually
purchase this online and it shipped to
my house the day that I went shopping if
that makes it so I just like through the
bag and figured let's add it to the
whole and I purchased this because while
I was in LA I spent some time with Brett
man rock I'm sure you guys know who he
is if you don't well then that is the
thing that's missing from your life if
you feel any emptiness it's him um you
can find him on Instagram he does some
YouTube videos he is so
hilarious he will make you laugh even in
your hardest times of trouble
and in person he is just so sweet and
kind and humble and just adorable I just
really enjoyed getting to know him and
spending some time with him
so anyways last week he texted me and he
told me that I needed this oil in my
life and if you tell me that I need an
oil I'm not even going to question you
not gonna lie it doesn't matter if you
tell me an oil I'm like not a problem
I'm already on my Sephora app I'm
ordering so this is by is it by Sunday
Riley called Luna I think so so it's by
Sunday Riley it's called the Luna
sleeping night oil and it says
next-generation retinoid oil reduces
pore size improves appearance of damaged
skin and fights wrinkles I'm not really
asking for much more and on the back it
says that it is an essential oil complex
so I'm like hi like anything essential
oil it says it focuses on damage caused
by Sun time pollution lifestyle and
stress it sounds so amazing so I'm
really excited to try this
it looks like super bougie like the
packaging good sturdy packaging I'm a
sucker for it like this is yes this is
nice and the bottle looks like these so
I'm really really excited to try it I am
still using the exact same skincare
routine that I filmed like months ago I
know recently so many people have been
telling me that my skin looks like it's
glowing more and I'm like okay I don't
know why no I'm not pregnant um put out
there cuz the comments oh they'll roll
in I am not pregnant
I'm using the exact same all Sanitas
skin care but I will always always add
an oil to my routine so I'm so excited
to try that cuz stuff has just been
sitting in the bag ever since I went
shopping four days ago and I'm like Oh
dying to try these things I picked up my
favorite dry shampoo I have two favorite
dry shampoos and one of them is the
Elizabeth and James I think it's called
like the Nirvana and there's the white
one in the black one they're like the
same thing with different scents dr. bad
dry shampoo is bomb it's expensive but
it's so good and then this is the other
one I can't live without this I oh my
gosh you guys I probably got through
eight bottles of this like no joke it's
by the brand dry bar called detox dry
shampoo and I got the one that's made
for brunettes because the original one
it leaves like a white cast in my hair I
of course can like rub it out and like
use a blow dryer and you won't be able
to see the white cast but I thought
maybe the brunette will
we'll look better with my red hair I
wish the dry shampoo brands would make
redheaded shampoo like I want it to
spray like a red tint on my hair now say
that's what I want so then I got five
make up forever eyeshadows make up
forever has some of the best eyeshadows
in my opinion I love the pants I like
those big fat meaty shadows I love them
and the quality is like unlike any other
they are just so bomb and so I got five
different shades the first one is this a
gorgeous like a mermaid turquoise and
this is the shade any - 304 I'll put
like all the names down below because
I'll put like em you - trio for
turquoise because they're kind of
strange like follow along they're like
kind of complicated numbers but look at
this color Oh
oh my god and then I got this one which
is more blue but oh my god equally is
beautiful and this is d / - 3 6 get
ready my god they're so gorgeous I just
love these colors in the summertime so
much I think they're so beautiful if I
would wear these with my outfit right
now it might be a bit much but honey I
am a bit much I'm going to say the best
shadow for last I'm gonna set for less
but I got this like khaki kind of
brownish green shadow right there so
pretty for a smoky eye and then I got
this one that reminds me a lot of like
Mac amber lights because it's like so
yellowy rusty golden right there
look how pigmented these are they're so
beautiful last but certainly not least
the best one in my opinion this is the
shade n - 846 I liked died right there
on Sephora floor and was defibrillated
and brought back to life when I saw this
it was a whole process it was a show
this is like the most gorgeous matte
creamy pigmented purpley red I've ever
seen in my life does this shadow not
like speak to you and many different
languages are you kidding me
I just want to take this and like rub it
all over my entire body as I'm digging
that's how much I love the shadow I
picked up a sugar lip treatment just for
my purse because I'm
running low on lip stuff and I think
ever since I got my lips done I don't
know why but I feel like my lips are
chapped just always at all times like I
can't even like put enough chapstick on
them they're always Chaplin like is it
cuz the skin is like expanded like
what's going on with these dry lips
I got a lipstick fight beauty my beauty
has such beautiful lipstick formulas
they're creamy but yet they still last a
while they're not like too creamy
they're not too matte this is in the
shade sugarcane and you guys are gonna
guess like obviously would you be so
shocked I pull out like this bright
purple you big who are you look of
course it's a pinky nude of course I
have a sickness okay I buy these things
I'm like I have nothing that looks like
this and I go home and I'm like I have
185 lipstick through this exact same
color but like to me they're all like my
children my babies and I'm like I don't
discriminate
I don't favor any of you like you're all
equal to my heart speaking of a lipstick
I got two that are from the new urban
decay advice I had to keep looking at
viewfinder to see if like I'm in focus
the urban decay of Vice lipstick a lion
I haven't really heard anything about
these like I know they had that amazing
event with Ruby Rose in New York I
couldn't go to cuz I was working I love
you rose so much she is like my ultimate
girl crush the first one I got right
here is called safe word and this is a
comfort mat meaning its matte but it's
comfortable you get it it's such a
gorgeous shade it swatches beautifully I
will say that I'm sure it's gonna be
gorgeous because it swatches like a
dream it's such a pretty color and then
oh well okay and then this one is in the
shade unicorn which is probably the
exact same color is this one right here
because it's like a pinky nude let me
swatch it below it
oh no they're different they're totally
different they're like so different I
swear to God but they are they're
different they're so different this one
is more lavender and I see I'll justify
anything I am dangerous don't take me
shopping with you because I'll be like
oh girl you need that that is so
different you can't bring about that so
then I had a little love affair with the
brand
what's a call it hold on
hold on hold on the este edit which is
like the new kind of not the new brand
but yeah like the new brand from Estee
Lauder and I was talking to girls before
about it and they were saying how
basically Estee Lauder is like they have
like this name to be for more like
mature skin and like the older woman so
they want to do something like fresh and
young and different so that's what this
bread is all about this is going to seem
sponsored because the fact that I have
Sony products when the SA edit but here
today seats not sponsored I just had a
lot of fun because I was really excited
about this new brand and it just looks
so pretty and Kendall Jenner's face
looks so beautiful and I was like okay
okay I'll vinyl um the thing I am most
excited for though where is is this
right here because my friend Marissa who
works at Sephora told me that this is
like the Jewess most hydrating
foundation so I was like girls just stop
talking and put it my bad yes please I
am sold like if you just say dewy
hydrating highlighting like those
keywords I don't have questions I don't
have to just put into bed I'm fine
it's called the skin glowing ball make
up with pink peony so I am so excited to
try this
I can't wait it just looks like this and
I am all about that glow light then I
got this flash illuminator in the shade
morning light again this was off of my
friends recommendation she said that she
mixes it in with foundation and she
loves the way it looks so judging by the
texture this is not something that you
would want to put on top of your
foundation because it's definitely very
balmy but mixing it in like it's such a
pretty like golden glow it feels really
it feels so different it doesn't feel
like a liquid it feels like a balmy
texture so I'm really excited to mix
this in with my foundation and glow to
the heavens I picked this up because it
was like sitting on the gondola as soon
as you walked into Sephora and those
gondolas always get me that are standing
there and I'm just like oh yes of course
it forced honey I need these things so I
need to buy them this is called the
bronze team I'm sorry bean team bronze
hydrate + glow so I bought this
specifically for what's inside of the
two because it haven't this concept
where there's like a bronze gel in the
tubes and there's also this right here
it's like a highlighted bronzy thing
right there I'm going to be honest
though I don't think I'm ever going to
reach for that I bought
for what's inside I thought that the
color is such a pretty brown shade and I
really didn't think I had anything like
this so you can mix this with your
foundation you can put it on your body
whatever you want it's a liquid bronzer
and I just think that it looked really
really beautiful and it doesn't look at
all glittery or sparkly it just has this
gorgeous Sheen and I love that I love
when something just has a sheen and not
like a glitter in it then the last two
things that I got are both lipsticks
from the Estee edit and the first one is
in the shade sundae a vibe and I have
like this kind of cool like blue on red
it goes down the silver bottle it's
really it's really different um this
color is really really pretty
totally different everything else I have
ready oh my god that like basically
looks the exact same as the color right
there I'm not gonna lie at this point
like that's very similar but they're so
beautiful I'll give one to a friend if I
like one better um but this is a matte
lipstick it's called mattified I still
like a creamy matte I would guess super
pretty and then this one is called a
natural and this is called the Baris lip
color Rouge nude this one is like really
sheer and has like a really glossy Sheen
to it like you'll see when I swatch it
like you can barely even see it I
honestly don't even know if it's gonna
serve a purpose but I just thought that
it looked really pretty and different in
the fact that it was just like so shiny
and glossy I thought I want to try this
and this one I love because it has an
ombre white weight in silver that's so
pretty
are you guys that completes this Sephora
haul I hope that you enjoyed kind of
like you went shopping with me I do have
a ton of makeup right here that I have
not used yet I went through all my
packages I opened everything up so I
have like everything from the past six
weeks that have been sent to me through
PR and I think I want to do it a
full-face first impressions video like
everything for the first time like
foundation bronzer blush lips brows
everything first impressions I think it
sounds kind of fun right let me know if
you guys want to see that so okay I stop
rambling I love you guys thank you for
watching I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
