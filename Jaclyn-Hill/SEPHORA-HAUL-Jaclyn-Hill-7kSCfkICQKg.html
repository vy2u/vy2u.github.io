myself so that you guys aren't getting a
little peep show leggo I did buy all of
this at Sephora Oh Candyland
hello everybody so today I'm going to be
doing a makeup haul I have made quite a
few trips to Sephora in the last couple
of weeks to a month ish and I figured
that I would show you guys everything
that I have purchased because I'm super
excited about everything I love shopping
for makeup more than anything in the
entire world not to mention I'm also
trying to kind of film videos that fill
in the blanks until I can do a makeup
tutorial because the splint that I have
on my pinky right now makes it very hard
to film a tutorial because it is in the
way the entire time so figure this is a
good way to just kind of fill in the
blanks until I can fill it tutorial for
you which will probably about a week so
let's just jump right into it I've got
two bags from Sephora so let's not waste
a time all right first things first is I
got the philosophy purity one-step
facial cleansing cloths
I love purity if anyone knows me and
watches my channel they know that purity
face wash is my favorite face wash of
all time I love how gentle it is it
removes all makeup and dirt and is just
so awesome so when I found out that they
had the face towelettes and the
speechless speechless love them okay so
I get the Josie Maran 100% pure argan
oil in light this is her new argan oil
it is the same as before it's just a
lighter edition so it's not going to be
as thick and heavy on the skin so for
people who are very oily this is a great
alternative for you to apply at night to
combat your oil and it's not as heavy I
personally bought this for myself as a
daytime moisturizer I got it yesterday
and I ran home and took off my makeup
and start from scratch which is what I
always do whenever I go shopping for
makeup and I applied it as a daytime
moisturizer and went in and apply my
foundation afterwards and I loved it it
looked beautiful all day long so then I
got some products we're really outside
of my comfort zone for me because I
normally gravitate towards the same
lines in the same types of products but
I thought that it would be fun just to
kind of get things that I haven't ever
gotten before so this right here is an
alum as
cheak highlighter I have never bought
anything from Illamasqua in my life
there's a first time for everything I'm
super excited I've heard great things
about this brand this is called gleam
and it's in the shade aurora so this
right here is a cream highlight and on
the back it pretty much says that it can
be used for anything eyes cheeks body it
is very wet I don't know if that makes
sense but it is like creamy creamy
creamy it looks like that right there it
is
I've got swatches all over the place it
is very creamy it's beautiful I put it
on yesterday on my cheeks chin and then
center of the forehead and blend it out
with my foundation and oh my gosh I wish
I knew about this product in the
beginning of summer because it is so
beautiful and gives you such a gorgeous
natural glow okay moving on with
products that I have never owned before
this right here is the terra cotta
bronzer by Guerlain now I have heard so
much about this bronzer for years and
never purchased it because of the price
finally broke down and got it I got mine
and shade one it definitely is a terra
cotta tone it is very Orange II I must
say it is beautiful on the skin it
blends out so gorgeous but the smell is
insane like it is so full of fragrance
and smells like straight perfume to the
point that when I even using it as a
compact I got this like two days ago
yesterday yeah I went shopping yesterday
and I was holding him yesterday to apply
my lip gloss and just holding it I could
smell it and I was like oh overwhelmed
by the scent so we'll see but I tried it
on and it was beautiful so that's that
then I got urban decay they had these
new moon dust eyes shadow sand I got two
of them they are so pretty they remind
me so much of Mac's pressed
pigments packaging looks like this and I
got two different shades
I got space cowboy and Zodiac zodiac is
this gorgeous gorgeous green it is so
pretty like is that a joke it is so
beautiful and then I got space cowboy
like I mentioned which is just an
all-over really pretty neutral shade
they almost look wet they're so full of
shimmer
in glitter they are beautiful I love
them I love love products like that then
I got the cielo all-over shimmer duo and
kitten eye through the packaging away
for this the moment I tried it I loved
it so much I even think about I see the
packaging away it's so awesome so this
is a cheek highlighter it is so
beautiful this right here is like a
pinky highlighter and this is more beige
you can see them like that this is beige
this is pink sorry I'm trying to keep my
splint out of the way um I love these
because one can be used for a lighter
skin tone and the other for a darker so
you can see there's the light one and
there's the darker one
the darker beige one is too dark as a
highlight on me I can't use it up on the
high point of my cheeks I can use it on
the balls of my cheeks but it's a little
too dark and it looks a little too muddy
up here which is actually a good thing
that means that light and dark skin
tones can use this so amazing products I
love it keeping with Stila I got the
smudge crayon waterproof eye primer
shadow and liner this too is in kitten
oh my gosh I love oh I already have a
swatch on my hand from earlier so you
can see it right there it's been on my
hand for about an hour and a half so you
can see it's dry now and once it dries
it dries it does not move I have this
actually on the center of my lip today I
used it as a primer just to make that
pink pop a little bit more um it's
beautiful that gorgeous I love anything
kitten from Stila it's like my favorite
eyeshadow in the world I've gone through
tons of them because I just love love
them okay
then for some reason I went over to
Saint Laurent and thought I was Donald
Trump for five minutes and bought three
different lip products so first I got by
accident actually this lip stain which
one are you
you I didn't even mean to I thought it
was a lipstick and then I grabbed the
package got home realized it was a stain
no once I owned it I loved it so much I
couldn't return it so this is like the
exact same packaging is the L'Oreal lip
stain if you guys are familiar with that
one it I will say that the Saint Laurent
one is better it looks prettier feels
better and lasts longer so I guess in
this case you do get what you pay for
it's that shade right there it is so
pretty I was wearing it yesterday
I and so many people were asking me what
I had on my lips it looks so natural
it's a little bit of a gloss but it the
color is amazing it just looks so
beautiful and then I got two more these
are the new rouge ville upside so these
are lipsticks that looked almost like
glosses when they're on your mouth I
have one on right now with a lip gloss
on top
I got shade 13 and shade 9 I just I love
the packaging so much I think the
packaging of why I sell lipsticks are so
luxurious I'm such a sucker for it so I
got this one right here this is number
13 it looks like this
you can see when it goes on it does not
come off opaque or pigmented it's just a
really pretty shine and then this one is
nine and this is the one that I am
wearing on my lips right now looks like
that right there
so pretty I love how natural they are
these are like my favorite types of lip
products ones that aren't aren't very
loud and intense okay
two more things I got the Urban Decay
long wear lip pencil this is 24/7
glide-on lip pencil in native I got this
to match the lipstick that I own I love
this shade it's such a natural nude
pinky shade you can see that swatch
right down the center right there I love
this lip liner this is my second
favorite type of lip liner my first one
is definitely the Mac Pro Longwear
pencil this is next in line though Urban
Decay's 24/7 is really really a great
lip pencil okay I am obsessed with this
gloss seriously obsessed this is the
buxom what is this buxom full-on lip
polish and this is in shade Samantha
it's a very neutral gloss it doesn't
come off really thick and opaque like it
looks in here it comes off with a really
gentle baiji oh so ready I love the way
it feels on your lips oh my god you have
no idea
it's like minty but it doesn't tingle
it's like smells like mint vanilla is so
amazing I love anything I'm menthol just
all over my body and then I got three
foundations to finish off this
Paul first I got dates the Smashbox
liquid halo HD foundation this
foundation is so pretty it has a
beautiful iridescent glow to it it's not
shimmery and it doesn't look cheap I was
really nervous at first I was gonna look
like you know it yeah you get it it
doesn't look like chunky shimmery no
glitter nothing like that it just has a
really beautiful fine pearl essence to
it and it looks so gorgeous
I want twice now in the last couple of
days so beautiful both times I love the
packaging it's a glass bottle it has the
pump
I love the foundations with pumps as
opposed to the next one I'm going to
talk about I have a very love hate
relationship with this foundation this
is the NARS sheer glow foundation I
owned this foundation forever I love the
consistency I love the way it wears I
love the way it looks I'm actually
wearing it today but I had to mix a
different foundation in with it because
I can never find my color this color I
thought was perfect this is Barcelona
Barcelona medium for and I tried it on
my arm in the store and I was like it's
perfect it was just a little bit lighter
than my arm and I was like okay that's
exactly what I go for is just a little
bit lighter than my arm is usually the
color that I want on my face then I got
home put it on my face let it oxidizes
and it was like two or three shades
darker so now I have to go back and get
a different shade and the shade lighter
than this I think is strong bully and
that one is so yellow it's like green
which I know isn't going to work on my
skin so I'm in a predicament because I
love love this foundation so much but I
need the right color and I feel like all
the colors in this particular foundation
are either like jaundice yellow or like
hot pink and I need something a little
bit more neutral last but not least for
the foundations I got the new NARS
radiant creamy ssin the way it comes in
the packaging is very different it looks
like this I got medium to Santa Fe and
then it comes with a separate thing that
looks like this you open it up and he is
going to just sit in there like that
tada and then we open it like so and
then it's got a little place let me not
blind you it's got a little place right
here okay this is so awkward with my
hands for a sponge which I am NOT going
to put a spine
I only use brushes so it's it's an
interesting compact for a foundation
it's fairly large for the amount of
products you're getting but it is what
it is it is so creamy it has a beautiful
radiant glow to it but it is extremely
hydrating so if you are not dry or
normal you're not going to like this if
you like a full coverage matte finish
this is not your foundation but for my
ladies who have dry skin or normal skin
and want to have that glowy dewy fresh
look
then this foundation is absolutely gorge
okay so that wraps everything up that is
my entire haul oh I won't do that
quickly hopefully you guys are able to
keep up with me and hopefully you have
an absolutely wonderful weekend thank
you so much for watching this video and
I'll talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
