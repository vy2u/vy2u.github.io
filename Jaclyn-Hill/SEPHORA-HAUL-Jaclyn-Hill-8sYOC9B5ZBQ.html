a Sephora haul I asked you on Twitter if
you prefer to see a lush haul or Sephora
and Sephora one by a tiny bit most of
you were just like do drugs or just like
combine into one video and I was like oh
my god when you see how much makeup this
girl bought you're gonna be like you got
a problem I understand why you can't fit
both into one video so this is not just
one trip to Sephora this is a few trips
to Sephora combined into one big
gigantic bag also I just want to say
thank you very quickly to those of you
who came out to the meet-and-greet
yesterday at Brandon mall and Brandon
Florida um to the lush cosmetics or it
was so awesome it's always so awesome
meeting you guys but I'm like loving
these local meet and greets recently
like as opposed to IMATS where it's such
chaos like I feel like yesterday I
actually got to have more time even
though there was a moment where it was
at panicked and rushed I only got to
spend like 10 seconds with each of you
um it was still awesome
for those of you who hunger on the store
after everyone left and did some
shopping and I got to talk to you guys
like one-on-one and really get to know
you you guys just touched my heart's
like I just love you guys so much I came
home last night like talking Jon's ear
off about yesterday I was like it was
about my life so I just love you guys so
much I'm eternally grateful and
appreciative for you watching my videos
and supporting me and just like
listening to the recommendations that I
give you like I'm just so glad that this
product knowledge I have is reaching you
guys and helping you guys so yes thank
you thank you a million times thank you
and for all of you who were like where's
John John was at home in bed he has
ilysm to situation going on right now so
he's in some pain but moving on let's
get to the hall
let's do this Hemme a makeshift table
I'm gonna cut my bag right here next to
me and dig in as I go because this is
heavy
first roll problems just went honestly
my shopping bag is too many
so first product is the Tarte pure
maracuja oil it took me quite some time
to purchase this because Tarte is
obviously a makeup brand and whenever I
make it brand comes out with a skincare
product I'm always kind of like about
purchasing it really fast I kind of wait
around to see what other people think
and hear reviews or if my friends try it
out just because it's like you're
obviously good at makeup but makeup and
skincare are two different worlds with a
lot of different ingredients so I've
heard great things about this so I
figured why not you guys know I love my
beauty oils and honestly the packaging
was so durable take this little wooden
hut it's so cute I've used it twice now
and I just keep putting it back in here
cuz I'm like I like it so it's just in
this nice package purple bottle and I
love that it got like a button at the
top to fill up this little eyedropper
than here so yes so far I've only used
it twice I think and it felt really
really nice on my skin then I got the
bare minerals bio Lucent mineral
brightening treatment this was actually
recommended to me from you guys someone
left a comment on one of my recent
videos telling me that I need this in my
life and then a few you commented on
that comment saying like oh my gosh
Jacqueline you do I'm assuming that it's
new I don't know much about bare
minerals that is a brand I'm not very
educated on this is supposed to help
diminish the look of dark spots and
discoloration while brightening the skin
it is so pretty on the back of my hand I
have not used it yet since its new but
it has no shimmer and no sparkle but
yeah it gives this beautiful a
luminosity and almost makes the skin
look like it's a little bit tighter I
don't know if you can see that but it's
all on the back of my hands so I'm
really excited to try this this seems
like a makeup not a makeup a product I
would love in the summertime on days I'm
not wearing makeup if that makes sense I
got the Too Faced sweethearts perfect
flush blush in the shade peach Beach
great yes peach Beach
obviously the packaging is absolutely
adorable it's two-faced and this was my
favorite blush as opposed to the other
one that came out this is fairly new um
the pigmentation is beautiful on the
back of my hand it's a gorgeous color as
you can see it does have a little
shimmer in it and tiny little specks of
glitter I tell you that because some
people absolutely despise glitter on
your cheeks I am not typically a fan of
it but this one it's very finely put in
there so we shall see I've never used a
two-faced blush before so I am excited
to see how this goes I got the new buxom
show some skin weightless foundation
this was recommended to me by Marissa
she is a girl who works there at Sephora
yes I know them all on a first-name
basis are you surprised it looks like
this is a sheer to medium coverage on
the back of my hand she told me that it
is buildable it is a light to medium
coverage that says here on the bottom
with a broad spectrum SPF 30 I do not
like a high SPF of 30 in my foundation
typically like at all but when I felt
this on the back of my hand it's such a
beautiful foundation for summertime it
feels much more like a tinted
moisturizer or maybe a BB cream so I
just wanted to get it because in the
summer time I do typically like to use
on a daily basis a much more sheer
foundation or attention oyster Iser as
opposed to a full face because I do live
in Florida and a full face of makeup is
just life Oh but even tinted moisturizer
is like oh so there's really no hope and
then totally random but I got the Peter
Thomas Roth triple acid peel I got this
because I've been having some issues
with my skin texture recently because of
this weather change I believe also just
some hormonal things going on but if you
can see in here it comes with all these
different applications and then a pad in
the center it's very different I've
never seen anything like it I'm very
very excited and eager to try I'm going
to try this so as I get done filming
this video but I haven't having
sure and unevenness I don't know if you
can see I do have texture where you
typically get it with hormones like
around my chin and nose area and so I
just want to do a peel just to kind of
go and deep and dig it out so that's
what I got this for and then I got both
of the new josie maran a facial mist
which I was so excited about when I
found out that she was coming out with
some facial sprays this one is the
lavender and this one is the rose so the
rose is more energizing and it literally
smells like a straight bed of roses it's
the more pink tone and then the lavender
one literally smells like lavender which
I love because I am like a high strong
person who enjoys lavender it relaxes me
very much so and this one is more like a
calming blue shade literally smells
exactly like lavender and roses they're
both just meant to hydrate help the skin
glow make you look useful that sort of
thing so I love facial sprays and I'm
super super excited about these and then
I got the first aid Beauty facial
radiance serum my sister who's an
aesthetician she loves first aid beauty
I've tried a few things I love this
brand so I wanted to introduce a serum
back into my skincare routine because I
have not used one for almost two years
and it's definitely important to use a
serum it definitely helps penetrate
almost it's almost like the most deep
penetrating product that you put on your
skin so I wanted to go ahead and get one
eye lift into it this one looked like it
was right at my alley it's supposed to
illuminate and help texture and reduce
discoloration which is exactly my
skincare issues right now so I'm really
excited to use this as supposed to
brighten it has vitamin C all that good
stuff so I'm excited to finally get back
to using a serum and then I got three
ambient lighting blushes by hourglass
this was one of the main reasons that I
went to Sephora last week was for these
blushes when they came out because I've
been super super excited and waiting
their arrival so I did get three
different colors I got radiant magenta
that looks like this
as you can see it has like the lighting
powder running through it like a little
river it's so cute radiant magenta looks
like that as you can see
it's a really light flush on the skin
it's not crazy pigmented this one right
here is diffused heat this has more of a
rose reddish undertone to it with again
that lighting powder running through it
that is radiant heat right there and
then last but not least I got dim
infusion which is a really pretty curly
shade and might not focus honestly and
that one is down there on the bottom of
my hand which I don't know you can even
really see because these are very very
sheer blushes but the thing I like about
them the most is these kind of blushes
will really appeal to the average woman
because the average woman isn't going to
want to be using frankly scarlet from
Mac which is like the most hot pink
blush in the entire world so these kind
of blushes are really nice because if
you go a little overboard it's not going
to be like oh my god because there's
such a light wash of color so I am
really excited about these and I love
the idea that giving like a really nice
glow from within along with a shade it's
just it's a really gorgeous idea and I'm
excited about them I got two lip glosses
one in the shade Pierre and one in a
shade I cannot even pronounce so I'm
gonna try so this right here is Pierre
it's a nice neutral color but it has a
little bit of rose in it so it's not an
actual nude and then this pink one
underneath is the color that I cannot
pronounce that all have listed below for
you but I will show you what they look
like Pierre is the one on top and then
the shade that I cannot pronounce is on
bottom but again I will have that in the
description bar below this video I got a
new Anastasia brow is in the shade
caramel do you say caramel or do you say
caramel because I said caramel when I
like my entire childhood and as an adult
somehow it's transitioned to caramel
because caramel is much prettier like
yes I love the ground a camel
Frappuccino yes I'm somebody anyways I
got Anastacio brows in caramel caramel
whatever because it has been my favorite
brow pencil recently to fill in the
outer portion of my brows what I'm using
today love it and I was just running out
so boom I finally got the Dior skin nude
BB cream I have been here
this is the best BB cream in the entire
world for so long I figured okay spring
and summer is finally amongst us and I'm
going to go buy it because spring and
summer is what I usually like to use BB
creams the most so I've heard that it
like the price is it's worth every
single penny so I thought that I would
try it out and so I'm obviously you're
not gonna go see if a BB cream looks
good on camera I don't why I'm doing
this for you right now but just putting
on the back of my hand in the store I
was like oh feels so luxurious it's read
donkey dogs then I got the benefit gimme
brow and honestly like it is the cute
little thing in the entire world I don't
even know what it's supposed to do I'm
just assuming that it fills in your
brows but it's so cute
I just had to have it because this
packaging like I am such a sucker for
packaging when I saw it in the store I
was like stop like honestly but I don't
know why it's so small honestly like
what is this gonna do fill in one brow
hair then I got two buxom lip colors
these are these are the buxom full-on
lipstick they are the matte color
I got it in Sydney and London I did not
know that they had a lip color that was
all matte so I was kind of excited about
this so the lighter pink one right here
is London and then this one over here is
Sydney so they're a nice light wash
they're not really intense which is a
little bit different for a matte but I'm
excited since they're matte and they're
not really deep we're getting towards
the end thank you lord I got a NARS duo
eyeshadow and easel Tristan easel right
that's how I think of the name from that
movie such a good movie I just had to
have it because it's these beautiful
warm colors like you guys know me
there's nothing new and when I bought it
I was like why are you getting this you
own these colors but then I got home and
I was like I actually don't like these
colors are so pretty and I thought
they're gonna be just like amber lights
and antiqued from Mac let me get myself
in focus but they actually have more
color payoff and much more brightness
than amber lights and antique so I'm
really glad that I got these because you
guys know me
love these colors I made my first ever
purchase from Clinique weird I know I've
had a few people comment me ask me why I
don't use Clinique and it's not like a
specific issue it's just I don't really
care for their makeup or their skincare
products so I did love these eye so I
got two of their new blushes and I
really loved the packaging how they're
in this clear packaging you can see the
blush sitting in it you can see all the
products that you get to the very bottom
and I got peach pop and plum pop I was
trying to get something that was a
little bit different than what I already
own because once you start to own so
much makeup you get to the point where
you're like is this all starting to look
the same but in a makeup junkies mind it
never looks the same you can have sixty
blushes they're the exact same color and
you're like nope all totally different
so this is the plum pop and this is the
peach pop and they both have flowers and
grade into them and they are super cute
they have great pigmentation and I
wasn't even going to really look at them
I walked past him a couple times without
even watching them but then once I
actually gave them a chance I was like
oh wow these are gorgeous and they had
this beautiful sheen with no shimmer or
glitter which is ideal for mature women
who do not want to be emphasizing any
lines or wrinkles or dark spots or just
any problematic areas so I am impressed
so far and I cannot wait to use these I
got the Tarte clean slate flawless 12
hour brightening primer so this is
supposed to be a long lasting primer I'm
always looking for new primers just
because even being a makeup artist and
working with every brand you can think
of for the past what four or five years
I still do not have a primer that I
really stand by and think like you can't
live without this like to me if you are
cleansing and moisturizing properly and
doing your makeup in the steps that they
should be taken primer really doesn't
make a difference I've never seen a big
difference so I'm always trying to prove
myself wrong and find something that's
just like yes
so this one is silicone free waterproof
and
right knee Antipas left last 12 hours so
I was like hmm they have this same one
that is supposed to be
poreless helping with enlarged pores I
don't have an issue with that so I got
the one for brightening because I'm
always trying to brighten and make
things more dewy and glowy so I'm
excited to try this because I'm always
waiting to find an amazeballs primer
this is the Make Up For Ever HD cream
blush in the shade 3 3 5 and I'm not a
crazy cream blush person but I really
like this color because it looks more
like a bronzer and I did use it once
when I got home and I really really
liked it because again and once
springtime comes around I start using
products that are easier and more
natural-looking I don't know why I just
do it that way don't ask but I just
relate this color it's got a little bit
of peach in it but it's more bronze
color so I really really like it then I
got two new eyeshadows by Bobbi Brown
I got champagne quartz just because mine
broke during my move and it's one of my
favorites so I'm not going to show you
that because I used in a tutorial before
and then I got Bobby Brown rose gold
eyeshadow why did I not know that this
was a thing and why is it broken it's
got a little shatter in it but we gonna
be okay look at how beautiful this color
is I had no idea that Bobby Brown had a
true rose gold shadow this is so free so
it's got this romantic pink undertone
begetteth this gorgeous shimmery
champagne
oh I when I saw a tunnel vision like I
was so excited so I absolutely love this
this would look good on so many
different people I I love this I'm so
excited to wear it the last product that
I got was the clean skin perfume this
was like a gift with purchase and it was
like a little tiny bottle and when I
smelt it I was like oh my god I love
that I want the full-size bottle so I
got the full-size I
like the actual bottle itself how it's
like this purple to light ombre and it
smells so good it's one of those
perfumes that like you not everyone's
gonna like this perfume but I personally
I love it like I love it
I personally very clean scent but I
don't want to smell like I just got done
doing laundry because there's some sense
that are so clean that it's like raining
in like the morning woods I don't want
something that's going to be smelling
like downy or Tide
but this one is like perfect it has a
touch of warmth in it but it still
smells super fresh and clean so I am so
excited whenever I find a new perfume
that I like because it's such a big deal
to me because I'm gonna out where this
thing the next four months and I'm gonna
hate it
alright you guys know I have ever used
the words obsessed excited shear tone
and buttery I'm done as you can see I
did some damage these past couple of
weeks but that's what I do welcome to my
life I hope that you enjoy the Sephora
haul as always I love you guys so much

with a makeup tutorial not bye

emotions there needs to be one that's
