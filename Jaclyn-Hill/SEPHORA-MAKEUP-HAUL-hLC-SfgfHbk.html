be doing a mega Paul
not just any makeup all in the mother
lode of makeup hauls so I'm so excited
to be doing this because I ordered all
the products that you're about to see
online about a week ago and then they
came in the mail while I was in New York
City for two days and so I have not
looked like go through them and swatch
things yet because I decided to put it
off and do it all on camera here with
you guys who can experience the beauty
of makeup together I asked you guys on
Twitter if you wanted to see a haul and
everyone was saying yes so I figured
that I would wait till now to open
everything up and show you guys what it
is that I purchased I would have loved
to do this like literally the day after
New York City but oh my god you guys
this weekend I had a pipe burst on my
washing machine so my house was flooded
and I have wood floors and then my guest
bedroom closet where we keep like coats
and clothes and like home decor like the
entire closet is jam-packed full it came
tumbling down to the ground apparently
there was a weak piece of wood holding
it up and the whole thing came crashing
down I was like I was in my husband and
I was like did you sign me up for
adulthood and I wasn't looking at
because I just sign up for this like the
fact that I have been like worrying over
like the damage on the wood floors and
the pieces of wood and the way we're
gonna reconstruct the new guest room
closet it's like oh my gosh should so so
much so funny I feel like I was sick
blonde with braces like yesterday and I
just like blink and now my go welcome to
adulthood right so it's been a very
adult weekend having to deal with like
real life responsibilities so I'm super
excited to be sitting here on camera
just talking to you guys about makeup so
let's jump into the hall funny enough
this like online makeup shopping spree
was inspired by a subscriber of mine on
my last video I think it was it might
have been like the one before but some
somewhere on the last two videos of mine
I saw a comment from one of you that
really like yes like it was just a great
comment and it was constructive
criticism but it was done in such a kind
sweet way and this person was just so
nice about it telling me like you know I
love your videos I love your style but I
do feel like you use a lot of the same
products I wish you would switch it up
and not only use making peak as often as
you do
so on and so forth and she assumed that
she would like to see some different
techniques and she liked to see like
more in-depth videos of me explaining
what I'm doing and why I'm doing it like
I used to do like a year or two ago and
I don't know I just really appreciate
the comment because it was just so kind
and it inspired me to get online and
look at all the new makeup that's
happening and everything that's going on
and I'm gonna buy a bunch of new stuff
and get inspired to start stepping
outside of my box and using new products
and different things you know I'm saying
because I can't fall into ruts you know
we all can and even though like makeup
geek is my favorite shadows it doesn't
have to use it every single tutorial so
I really appreciated whoever you are for
leading that comment it was so sweet and
it had like 100 or 200 thumbs up so I
know tons of you guys saw and agreed
with it so I want to say thank you that
was like super cool just to come at me
in such a kind way because you to
remember when people come at you in a
mean way keep in mind your immediate
response it's like get defensive
which'll balls up and not hear it you
know and so when you leave a mean
comment to anyone on social media that's
gonna be their response there's gonna be
they're not you want to hear it but when
you come to someone from a place of love
they're going to receive it better and
I've always said because John can have a
hard time like I'm getting on a tangent
but John can have a hard time like
speaking his truth to people someone's
at my door I always tell them like you
can say anything you want to anybody as
long as you come from a place of love
and that's just like what I live by you
can always tell your truth you can
always say what you want to say as long
as you come from a place of love so I
just really appreciate whenever you guys
come to me give me constructive
criticism or giving me your opinion from
a place of love and I will always
receive it well so thank you for that
let's jump into the tutorial notes the
hall what did we get oh I bet one is my
brushes package how perfect is that I
got my makeup brushes while filming my
haul looks like so mint okay so I guess
I'll just show you guys this first
because it literally just came in the
mail this second like how perfect and
this is the artiste I believe it's
called our teeth brushes I purchased
this because I've gotten so many tweets
asking if I've used these and what my
thoughts on them are and so on and so
forth so I thought okay let's buy level
with one and see how it goes the eye
brushes from this brand I don't feel
like I can get on board with I'm just
like huh like I'm used to blending in a
certain way I still feel like that's
gonna be for me um so I purchased the
Oval eight brush from the elites
collection and let's see inside it looks
like this very cute
okay and so it looks like a toothbrush
and just get in there oh my gosh this is
so interesting I don't know how I'm
gonna feel about this I'm gonna try this
tomorrow though because I'm kind of
excited I have absolutely no opinion on
this yet I've never tried it so I'm
gonna use it I'm gonna let you guys know
how I feel about it so the first thing
that I got is the Kat Von D me vida loca
I think that's yeah maybe to loca I was
so excited when I saw his palette on
line because I just love things that are
overdone I know that this might not be a
practical palette because the fact that
is very large and this just slides right
out it's not perfect Akala t but I just
love palettes like this they're just
like so boss makes like command the room
I love it so the second I saw this I
knew I had to have it because I have
recently been so impressed with Kat Von
D shadows like I think that the past
year the Kat Von D branded as a whole
has gone to another level and they
definitely have my attention I've been
loving the shade light palette the face
and the eye la thing so I am super
excited to play with this palette right
here and I love the concept with the
neutrals right here in the center there
all mattes and then literally just a
rainbow a beautiful rainbow of
eyeshadows so I'm so excited and online
this shadow right here is the reason
that I wanted this palette so bad
obviously
hello that is pigmented yes honey and oh
look at that bat orange are you kidding
these are freaking awesome
oh so this right here the shimmer I'm
sorry so this one right here in the
center that is called skulls is like a
shimmery white highlight very white very
like silver cool tone highlight really
pretty it reminds me to have like a
crystal Avalanche from Mac so fun so
excited to play with this
so this is the Marc Jacobs primer and
I'm so excited tries products I've heard
great things about it and I have been on
a primer kick for like the past year to
year and a half back in the day I never
believed in primers what did I know
don't listen to her but now I am all
about primers like I just I have this
kind of thing for primers because
sometimes they completely suck they
don't work at all and other times
they're just like they surprise you and
they really are amazing so I've really
been into primers recently and this is
by Marc Jacobs and it is called the
undercover perfecting coconut face
primer anything with coconut has my name
written all over it coconut smoothie
coconut primer coconut face bright I'm
all about the coconut life and I love
the bottle on this anything that's white
is silver like Hello this is literally
how I decorate I could just like sit it
right back there anywhere in my house I
love this packaging and all it says
about this primer is it's instantly
impeccable skin smoothing makeup
Maximizer say that five times fast and
the consistency on the back of the hand
it comes out white and it's goes over
your skin like a milky kind of serum
consistency very thin
it feels very moisturizing it doesn't
say anything on the box though as far as
like if it's supposed to be oil control
moisturizing or anything like that so
I'm gonna try it out and I'm gonna see
and I will report back and you know like
I'm kind of like tough on primers so if
it doesn't really impress me and then
I'll be like you're going back cuz I
expect a primer especially for that
price to be doing a lot for me I got a
new perfume yes I order this online
without smelling it don't ask but I just
was like gonna take a chance and thank
God I opened this one up I cheated okay
I open this one thing up and I love it I
spray it on myself today and it smells
so good so this is by the brand Bull
Bulgari vulgari it's either Bulgaria or
Bulgari I'm not really sure but you know
what it's kind of irrelevant in my life
I don't need to know how to pronounce
that brand to be honest but they have a
perfume that is called coral like
Bulgaria curl coral god Johnson get it
together and it's in the exact same
bottle and it smells so good but it's a
little bit too warm for me any warm
perfumes just you mediately smell like
Bo
don't ask and I'm not kidding I can love
a perfume spray on my body and 20
minutes later it's like ooh someone has
like the Pitts tank like it's not cute
so I can't wear it so I was excited when
I saw one that was in the blue because I
just assumed that that meant it was
gonna be more like a cool fresh scent
and I love things that smell like floral
mixed with laundry I know it's a little
strange but it's so yummy it doesn't
even have a description but I'll link it
down below so you guys can I check out
like the perfume notes if you want to
but it's very very fresh and just
laundry esque and then next I got two of
the exact same lip products because I
love them so much I've talked about
these lip butters before my chorus
before but it was when I was talking
about the one that had like no tint in
it and then I discovered this one after
that and it is now like my ride-or-die
lip butter I love it that was a really
really weird noise which came from
outside but moving on
this is my ride-or-die nut butter I love
it so much I use it all the time if I'm
wearing makeup if I'm not wearing makeup
I just love it it has a tint in it but
the tint is like just pure perfection
I'll show you what it looks like how big
my nail into it on the back of my hand
oh you can't see that me put it on my
lips you can see it there I just have a
little bit of gloss on right now but you
can see it just my got a little effect
my lip gloss it just gives a little bit
of a like neutral tint so it's in the
shade jasmine speaking of course I got
the coarse Greek yogurt cleansing and
makeup removing wipes because I love
removing wipes I have them all over my
house for like when i'm swatching and
testing products and i remove my makeup
at the end of the day sometime in the
middle of X I'm just not having any more
so I'm always looking for new wipes
trying to discover the best ones the
purity ones and also there's um by ponds
at the drugstore the one in the white
package with purple on it it's like the
nighttime calming one I love those ponds
makeup wipes
I love the pier you want as well so I'm
always looking for new good wipes so I
wanted to try these out it's all they
had the Greek yogurt and
I follow that I love the Korres Greek
yogurt line so I want to get those try I
got a makeup brush that I'm so sad about
so I have my eye on this one for a while
and this is the way after sneeze oh my
gosh how was it a spiritual awakening
lashes are still on okay let's get back
to it so this is the face brush 3 by
Marc Jacobs and this is a buffing
foundation brush and I love foundation
brushes so much I feel like foundation
brushes are my favorite brushes like out
of all brushes and I just love how short
and fat this guy is like how dense and
perfection so I'm really really excited
to try this I'm really rough with my
brushes like I'm like a maniac did you
see me the second I put out I'm like
like that's what I do with all my
brushes like soon as I get them my first
thing is to immediately like rub them
around on your pants like rough them up
because I just feel like brushes works
so much better once you like beaten him
up a little bit show him who's boss kind
of like break them in so that's how I
work with my brushes but I picked this
up before and held it in my hand and it
just feels like a brush that I would
like so I'm so excited to try this so
next thing I got I'm so excited about
because she is a huge sensation on
Instagram and I follow her of course you
should probably follow her I'm sure you
already are following her and her name
is Hooda huda beauty I think that's how
you pronounce it I probably haven't
pronouncing her name right and totally
butchering it and I so apologize if I am
but huda beauty is a huge sensation over
and Dubai she has had her lashes over
there in Sephora and like her face is
like all over the window display it's so
awesome and so the second I saw these
were available on Sephora calm I was
like yes and I'm sure you guys if you're
on Instagram a lot and let the beauty
community of sure you see the pictures
like the girls like this with the lashes
so cute but I feel like for me it's more
like that's more like an accurate
representation of me as a person so next
I think this is a new brand the Noren is
carrying because I know that they just
pulled in a few new brands recently and
this is called Dino Platts and this is a
pearl shimmering base or hi
lighter and for some reason it like came
with like a sticky note with like a
phone number on it and I was like yo
Sephora I don't you trying to do but I'm
married the packaging is like literally
like a thinnest cardboard ever um but I
haven't tried this out yet I wanted to
try out on camera to see that because
it's me up consistency on the back of my
hand
oh that Marc Jacobs primer is still like
really like serie me like moisturize on
the back of my hand
Oh oh my God look at that else this is
oh my gosh this isn't really like
liquidy so when it blends out it just
has like a luminosity but it's not like
an intense liquid highlight when I order
this I was thinking that it was going to
be like a high beam by benefit like an
intense highlight but this one is much
milkier and thinner and more of like a
luminosity as opposed to like an intense
luminous highlight you know I'm saying
maybe it says on the packaging so it
says here how to use apply as a primer
over the entire face using fingertips or
brush and if you want to use a liquid
highlighter dab a small amount onto your
cheekbones temples bridge of the nose
etc okay so this is like meant to be a
primer and look what High Line okay I
mean like I like that idea of using this
as a primer because I love luminous
primers absolutely love the L'Oreal one
the becca one so i'll try this as a
primer and see how that works i am so
excited to talk about these next two
palettes i snapped about them because i
was like flipping out when i saw them on
Safaricom i'm assuming they're new
because I did not see these like a month
ago or so so I'm so excited to try them
I mentioned and it was like my July
favorites or my August favorites one of
those I mentioned this brand and one of
the palettes saying how like it was so
expensive my friend told me I had to try
it because it's such amazing quality
shadow so I broke out and bought it well
it's true I love that palette so much
I'm constantly using it but I put off
not doing a tutorial with it because in
the fact that is so expensive and I
don't like the idea of doing a tutorial
with a palette that's so expensive and
the people will feel like oh I want to
create this look but I can't because to
expect you know what I'm saying so I
haven't used it but oh
9 look at these ballots okay so we'll
start with this one because this is my
favorite and this is the VISAA art visit
art I'm not sure cut to visit art revise
our I really am gonna figure that out
when I get done filming cuz I really
should educate myself on that but this
is 0 for dark Matt this is just
literally like dreams come true right
here look at this
flippin palette day so we have Browns we
have Burgundy's we have like burnt
oranges we have such a gorgeous at
creamsicle orange purples we've got some
like darker blues you got this green and
like this kind of pukey olive green
which of course I love because anything
that looks like baby vomit like I'm all
about that life when it comes to
eyeshadow so I love this palette I can't
wait to use it like I said the other
visit are VISAA art palette that I have
is very very pigmented very blendable so
I'm so excited and this is just like the
electric palette on steroids this is
just like fire in your face clearly
you're not going to want to make a look
using more than like one or two shadows
in here this is like this is a palette
that you have in your back pocket and
you're doing a neutral look and you like
I want to pop a color today so I'm going
to use this or this or this you know I'm
saying this is a palette full of your
pops of color and this is the 0-8
editorial which is the perfect name for
this I'm going to swatch a color to see
mm-hmm yes perfection pure perfection
mm-hmm production let me see this orange
because this orange is speaking to me
you guys look at the pigment of these
these are mattes sick next II this blue
right here oh it's doing things to me oh
it's doing things to me let me swatch a
few from the other palette so you guys
can see that one as well
that's kind of pretty are you kidding me
look at these shadows you guys next I
got a Bobby Brown shimmer brick in the
shade pink glow one of my subscribers
tweeted me and told me that I had to
this in my life and I was like say no
more girl I got you wait this is not
shimmer cim sigh this is technically
just a highlighting powder not a shimmer
brick and it looks like so I don't know
if this is limited edition I don't know
any information on it all I know is I
purchased it because my subscriber told
me to and I was like I've got you and it
is so beautiful very very unique it's
like an icy I don't want to drop this
it's like an icy frosted pink and it's
just gorgeous oh my gosh I love that so
this might not necessarily be an actual
highlight that you wear the tops of the
cheekbones but more a blush overlay that
you kind of swoop over the apples of the
cheeks oh this is so gorgeous and this
is a shade that you can wear if you're
extremely fair which I love like you can
be like white as milk and you can wear
this so it's just gorgeous the second i
swatched it was it and this is why I
have the best subscribers in the world
so thank you so much to ever tweeted me
and told me that I needed pink glow in
my life because well you were right
then I got a bobbi brown shimmer brick
because I literally collect the shimmer
bricks like it's not even funny and it
comes in the special packaging I'm
assuming this is for holiday or
something because I've never had this
packaging before and I got this one just
in pink because I do not own just the
pink shimmer brick which I want to know
if this is like identical to the pink
glow because if they're like the exact
same thing I'm going to be like mm-hmm
I'm seeing a bombing I see you shaking
that is ah well I'm technically the
shimmer brick has a little bit more
purple in it the pink glow the pink glow
is prettier if you're going to do one do
the pink glow over the pink shimmer
brick my opinion the pink shimmer brick
is a little bit frosty earn as a little
bit more purple undertone both beautiful
though I got to Bobby Brown eyeshadows
because I love by Ron eyes shadows I
think they're really expensive and they
come in like the squares like this which
I'm not crazy about cuz I love my Z
palettes I love things
compact so I don't buy them as much as I
would like to because of those reasons
but her shadows really are great great
pigmentation her mats are my favorite
the shimmers I'm not so crazy about but
the math I love them very blendable very
creamy a very high pigmented so I got
two Brown shades and this one right here
is rich Brown number eleven so as you
can see it's a very rich kind of cool
tone Brown which I like because I feel
like I can never have enough dark dark
Browns and I feel like it funny enough
the makeup industry doesn't make enough
dark rich Browns I feel like we have
5000 medium tone Browns and I love a
sentence like black and I need more deep
Browns that are close to black but not
actually black so that's why I got these
and this one right here is black plum
which is just gorgeous like why do I not
own this as soon as I saw this online I
was like wait as I get this out of my
collection okay we're going to change
that right now so you can see the
pigmentation very very pigmented on the
back of my hand right there that is rich
no that's black plum and then I will
swatch for you guys rich brown and you
can see black plum is way more purple
and warmer and this one is a very cool
tone more ashy Brown which I love them
both why is my hand but white compared
to my face then over at Mac I freaked
out so this is the mac 135 brush and let
me tell you why I freaked out I have it
right back here waiting this right here
huh this is the map 136 brush they're
exactly the same as you can see but this
one is synthetic hair and this one is
goat hair so let me tell you this turd
with a Mac 136 I purchased this when I
was 17 years old maybe 16 I don't
remember if it was limited edition or if
it was just out for a while and they
discontinued it I'm not sure but this
brush was my favorite brush for probably
five years for bronzing and contouring I
use it all the time and when I worked at
the MAC store
I remember they still had smoothies left
over but they weren't still available
and they told me that you have to stop
using that because you're making the
clients want it and they can't because
discontinued and I was like bring it
it was like so upset about it so when I
was on that Cosmetics calm and I saw
that they had like the exact same one
back in stock lost my so excited
about this because like I said it was
one of my favorite brushes ever for
doing like a light contour and bronzing
so I'm so excited had this back in my
life and I cannot wait to use it
tomorrow because if it's as good as that
one I'm gonna become obsessed all over
again
alright you guys that completely doesn't
make a Paul I know that was a lot of
makeup but I am feeling very inspired to
try new things and branch outside of my
box and use some different products and
some different pallets for you guys so
of course as always let me know the
types of looks that you would like to
see let me know what types of palettes
what different brands you want to see me
use and I would be happy to do that for
you so just leave your requests down
below tweet me Instagram comment me
whatever you do you do it so thank you
so much for watching I love you guys and
I'll see you just a couple of days
