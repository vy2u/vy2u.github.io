September favorites I tweeted you
earlier asking if it was too late to
film this and you guys were like yeah so
we are on really quickly before I jump
into this video I am going to be having
another meet and greet next Saturday
October 12th it's going to be held at
Nordstrom International Plaza in Tampa
Florida from 1-3 p.m. it is the launch
of Topshop at Nordstrom if you don't
know Topshop is it is an awesome
clothing brand I absolutely love it
they're one of my favorite lines and
Nordstrom is so kind they're going to be
having me there from 1 to 3 to hang out
with you guys and take pictures so if
you guys are from Florida and you want
to hang out with me then I'll be there
from 1 to 3 you know so excited okay
enjoy the video so I actually don't have
that many products this month which is
kind of refreshing because my video
won't be an hour and a half like my
other favorites so the first thing is
it's a 10 miracle blow drive volumizer I
just got this like a week ago and I love
it I've only use it once or twice
because I don't wash my hair that much
because I'm super dry this smell of it
oh my gosh it seriously smells like MACT
aquatic perfume it's so refreshing I
want to use it as a perfume
oh I haven't said I absolutely love this
you think I'm weird right I could've
told you that in my first video so when
it sprays out it sprays in like one
perfect stream I absolutely love it I
spray it on my damp hair and then I go
ahead and blow-dry my hair just like it
says miracle blow-dry volumizer
it's not really disgusting or sticky in
your hair which I actually don't mind on
like root lifters that are kind of
sticky because I don't mind the texture
in my hair it's just me I just love this
it gives your hair a lot of volume
that's what I have in my hair right now
um a lot of you guys have been asking if
I've been wearing extensions recently
because you think that my hair has been
looking fuller and longer it is not
extensions but I will be trying
extensions soon I actually just got some
and they're sitting at home waiting to
be dyed so I will be trying out
extensions for the first time very soon
my next product I'm actually really
proud of myself because I've never tried
anything from this line before and it
was not a recommendation to me and I
just saw when I was in the drugstore and
I thought that looks really pretty it's
by Physicians Formula
and it is the powder palette mineral
glow pearls and shade light bronze pearl
so this is what I'm wearing right now on
my cheekbones as a highlight I
absolutely love it it is so pretty it
has like the perfect amount of
every highlight shade in it it has like
a little bit of silver neutral a little
bit of bronze so I'll put on the back of
my hand for you if you can see it right
there is that showing up on camera
yeah that's showing up right you can
suit a lot of inexpensive highlights
they go on choppy and gluey and chunky
this one doesn't it goes on nice and
smooth I was really surprised by how
much I actually loved it when I got it
so thumbs up Physicians Formula
next is the bareMinerals original
foundation I have mentioned this a
couple times in my videos but seriously
I'm so in love with this it's the
original formula I think I just said
that mine isn't shade light and I
actually use this just set my t-zone I
might have actually mentioned this in a
favorites video a month or two ago I'm
not positive but I use it every single
time I do my makeup it's a loose powder
and it has a luminosity to it and so
when you apply it it has this nice like
shimmer to it where it's not completely
dull and matte but yeah it's not like
actual glitter it just it's really
pretty I have it right now on all my
forehead and my t-zone area my chin this
whole situation because even though I am
dry I still need something to set that
area so that it doesn't move around
because I make a lot of facial
expressions this is a super basic
product I actually think I don't have
the time to appreciate really basic
items like this and this is just a
mascara from the drugstore it is the
l'oreal full definition voluminous
mascara I absolutely love this mascara
it has been like my ride-or-die for the
past six months it's just got such a
nice fluffy basic brush head it makes
your lashes so thick and like the right
ways it does not get clumpy I can
seriously put six coats of this stuff on
my lashes don't get clumpy it really
just makes them nice and full because I
do have longer lashes but they're so
spider skinny it's insane so I have been
loving this I actually have not been
wearing false lashes false lashes much
recently
because I've been embracing and them
with this mascara now I am wearing them
today so I know I'm sorry
next I have a few lip products the first
ones are these L'Oreal color riche lay
lack and lay matte so they just look
like this I saw an advertisement for
them like over a month ago and it has
taken me forever to track them down so I
really do love them this one is my
absolute favorite it's this purple tone
I think it is so pretty you can see how
rich it is I have been mixing this with
like all of my nude pink lip colors for
that perfect midtone shade I actually
love it and then this one is the lay
matte and this one is more of a straight
coral shade and obviously matte the
purple one I love because it looks like
a gloss almost on the lips it has such a
beautiful shimmer in it I want to get
every color but the place that I
actually found the not only had those
two so I was like okay it's better than
nothing this I actually have mentioned
before I believe this is babydoll this
is a chroma joystick by the Kardashians
I have been obsessed with the shade if
this beautiful just everyday pink color
it's like such a gorgeous nude and I
actually have mixing it with this purple
shade by L'Oreal so you can see the
color that that makes I really really
like that tone down a babydoll purpley
pink so all of these are drugstore items
right here and they have been my
absolute favorite all month long I've
been going back and forth back and forth
mixing these colors right here I just
absolutely love them so I'll take like
the Kardashian one and put it all over
my lips and I'll take the purple one and
just put it in the center for kind of
like an ombre pop of color it's really
beautiful this is much more of a
high-end color but I'm sorry I have to
mention it this is the YSL lipstick and
the shade one if the Rouge will looked I
have been obsessed with this it's very
similar to like creme Cup by Mac or
native by Urban Decay it is a beautiful
basic creamy everyday pink it is so
amazing I purchased my first why sell
lipstick in my entire life I think about
six or seven months ago
and now it's so hard not to want
everything even though they're expensive
they are so luxurious and the packaging
honestly like there's no prettier
packaging than that packaging when it
comes to lipstick I'm sorry it's the
truth don't hey me the really basic
product and I think I mention all these
basic products because I am in Chicago
with my family right now so I'm not out
purchasing new things and I don't have
my entire collection with me so I'm
using things I brought and I'm really
learning to appreciate the things I have
so this is the Sigma small angled East
65 brush I know at my meet and greet a
lot of people were coming and asking me
what brush to use for eyeliner because I
want to purchase it today and it is the
e 65
just makes putting on that eyeliner so
easy if you are a gel liner where I do
really recommend that you 65 um I think
it might technically be a brow brush but
that does not matter to me because a lot
of times brow brushes are shorter and
more dense and eyeliner brushes are
longer which makes no sense to me
because that makes it harder to control
the longer the bristles are so I have
just been really loving this for just a
nice precise angle wing I just I love it
so 65 amazeballs
shout out to benefit because I'm gonna
tension mention two products number one
is eight another basic but it is the
hoola bronzer you can see that I'm not
lying I've been loving it is my favorite
bronzer right now just because since we
are going into the winter months it
doesn't have too much orange in it or
too much Brown it's the perfect neutral
it has a perfect amount of red and
golden undertones it's just nice and
natural on the skin I think it's the
most universal bronzer for all skin
tones also doesn't have any sparkle in
it so you can use it as a bronzer on the
cheeks or contour I just absolutely love
this color I think it's perfect you can
wear it if you're super pale or if
you're a little bit more on the tan side
so I've been loving this also by Benefit
is the newer blush this is the rocket or
it is a rose gold blush it's what I'm
wearing on my cheeks right now along
with that highlighter I absolutely love
the shade I was so hyped for this to
come out I couldn't wait and it
definitely did not let me down other
than I will say it is not super easy to
blend if you have a hard time blending
your blush then you're probably not
going to like this one because it's not
a blush that you can just throw on and
blend out like Mac I feel like their
blushes are super super easy to work
with it's like they're not choppy this
one if you're in a rush it's probably
gonna look choppy you really have to
blend it out make sure it's perfect but
once you get it the color is just
absolutely amazing there are some days I
put it on I have no issue with it but
then like today when I was putting it on
okay this is like really choppy all over
my face so kind of goes back and forth
to more products and this is a big one
for me this has been my obsession for
foundation recently and I know it is
high-end but I'm sorry I love it and for
you guys who really believe the skin is
the most important thing on your face as
far as makeup is concerned like I do
then I don't mind spending a lot of
money on foundation and then going
cheaper with things like the lips and
the eyes this is
Giorgio Armani a luminous silk
foundation I absolutely love it I'm in
shade 5.75 oh my gosh I have nothing bad
to say about this foundation it does
everything I want it doesn't make me
look too hydrated where I'm greasy but
it's not matte it's like a perfect
natural beautiful finish it lasts so
long
it hasn't settled in my little fine
lines I have what yes I have them we all
have them it's okay it is just so pretty
I absolutely love this foundation it has
not let me down I use it every single
day with my Sigma f80 hello I didn't
need to say that you guys know I use it
with my Sigma f80 I just love it out of
the packaging - yes - psychotically
dirty because my nephew got into it look
how dirty that is No
last but not least is a makeup geek
eyeshadow I'm gonna get on my palette so
I can actually zoom and eventually this
is called chickadee and I know that the
color is a little bit scary but I have
been obsessed with this color I'm
wearing it right now on my top lid and
my bottom lid bottom lid under-eye my
under eye chickadee I absolutely love
this it's like a yellowy orange I don't
think the camera is really picking it up
it's a little bit more orangie a little
bit darker than the camera is making it
look um I absolutely love it I've been
using this as a transition shade and my
crease a lot recently for the fall it
just really pretty just gives you a nice
warm glow it's not super insanely
pigmented it's just perfect this is what
it looks like on the skin I know once
again it looks a little bit like barf
but I'm just drawn to those shades what
can I say so that is it for my September
favorites I really hope you guys enjoy
