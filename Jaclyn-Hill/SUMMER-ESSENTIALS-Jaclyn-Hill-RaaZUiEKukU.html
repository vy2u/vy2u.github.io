you
hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
my summer essentials video this is the
same thing in the summer must-haves
video it's just basically everything
that I love to use and consistently use
throughout the summer months this was a
very requested video I have tons of
stuff to talk about I feel like so I'm
going to try to just so that this isn't
completely and totally boring so the
first thing I'm going to talk about you
guys might be a little surprised because
in the past I have mentioned I'm not
crazy about this products like these
products but it is a primer I know I've
talked about how I don't think that
primers are really necessary but this
one is really great the new benefits
stay flawless 15-hour primer of course
the packaging is absolutely adorable why
wouldn't it be it comes up like this
it's like a bomb comes out like that you
just use it on the skin make sure that
you don't share this with people because
this could easily be extremely
unsanitary so just use it on yourself
and I went to Sephora while I was there
I asked if they had come out and they
said it wasn't releasing for like a day
or two but they had some in stock so the
woman went ahead and sold it to me long
story short she told me that in the
video the benefits said Sephora they
were very clear on saying when you apply
this to do one cheek and then apply
foundation the second cheek and then
apply foundation not to just rub it all
over the face and then apply foundation
because it dries very quickly so make
sure that you are applying this in
sections and then going in with
foundation to get the best results I
really really love that primer I use it
for about a week now okay next is a good
foundation you're going to want a good
foundation probably a different one that
you are using in the winter time so I
have it two different things here first
off I want to say the Revlon Colorstay
whipped foundation absolutely amazing if
you are at all oily I would recommend
this to you I mean year round but
especially here in the summer time it is
a whipped foundation it feels like
heaven it stays on for 24 hours I
believe it it is a
incredible it just grabs onto your skin
and it actually looks prettier the
longer that you wear it whenever I go to
wash my face after my makeup is been on
for eight nine ten hours I look at my
face and it looks even better than it
did when I applied it I know that's hard
to believe so good foundation is
definitely very important for the summer
months with all of this light and
humidity happening then for my dry skin
girls something like a tinted
moisturizer this is the Josie Maran
Argan to moisturizer I talked about this
in my a favorites video absolutely love
this it has a Mineski about thirty in it
so this is what I wear on my skin when I
am going outside if I'm going to be at
the pool or I'm going to the music park
this is where I wear on my face for my
SPF protection because if I actually
wear a sunscreen from like banana boat
or something it's going to break my skin
out so I use something like this plus in
the summer months when you get a nice
tan and a really pretty glow going on
you don't really need to take your face
up with tons of foundation to have an
everyday summer look it's very easily
too easy to accomplish with just a
tinted moisturizer next bronzer
obviously everyone wants to be bronzed
especially in this summertime it's all I
hear so I'm going to talk about two that
I think are very universal that anyone
is going to love this is the NARS Laguna
bronzer this is such a popular bronzer
so it's just a really basic medium tone
bronzer it has a tiny tiny bit of
shimmer in it I've said before how I
really don't like to contour with
shimmery bronzer because it can make you
look very muddy as in the sense that
you're dirty a lot of people have asked
me what muddy means just imagine taking
dirt and rubbing it on your skin it's
blotchy and it has kind of a gray tone
in it and muddy and shimmer and sparkles
can do that a lot of times in bronzer
but this one doesn't seem to ever do
that on me or any of my clients I've
used it on I don't contour specifically
with
I really like it just to like I'm not
wearing it today but I really like it
just to coat the cheeks and just to give
a nice glow it's a very very pretty
bronzer and if you're not sure which one
to buy and you want to buy bronzer for
the summer I highly recommend Laguna
everyone loves it every client I put it
on always thanks me for putting it on
them they just love it be next is a
higher-end product this is the Chanel
Universal bronzer this is a cream
bronzer it is so beautiful though it
doesn't look like it's got dark but it
is the bronzer on
you know it's bronze around me works for
my skintone I'm like an NC 30 right now
third yeah I haven't sunless tan in a
while so I'm like an NC 30 right now but
um this is just beautiful I would say
this is going to be a bronzer until
you're at NC 40 and Mac foundation up
until NC 37 it is just so beautiful a
little bit of tinted moisturizer and put
this on your temples and your forehead
and your cheekbones oh you are going to
be like bronze glowing goddess it is so
pretty I love cream bronzers right now I
don't think there's enough cream
bronzers out there in the cosmetic
market I think there should be more
because I just think they're so
beautiful but moving on a highlighter
this is something that anyone can afford
this is the hard candy tiki highlighter
this is a baked bronzer but it's a
highlighter I don't know why it's called
a baked bronzer it's clearly very light
I've used it in a few of my videos and
I've gotten great feedback on it people
really love it so this was like $8 at
Walmart I had on the top of my
cheekbones today I mentioned one of my
videos I wasn't crazy because it had
mineral oil in it as like its first
ingredient or something its third
ingredient has mineral oil in it and
everyone was asking why is mineral oil
bad and i was responding to a bunch of
comments telling you to look it up but
basically mineral oil just clogs your
pores and it can age you and it can
cause wrinkles and me personally I like
to use monoi oil on my skin ever because
it breaks me out it irritates me I mean
they
that our oil to repair cars to like
grease up the engine and stuff so when I
think about the fact that they're
putting this ingredient into a skincare
product that they rub on the engine of a
car that freaks me out I don't want that
on my face so it's just a personal thing
you guys are more interested in learning
about mineral oil just type it in on
Google and you'll find everything about
it okay next a blush this is my favorite
most Universal blush I feel like I'm
trying to everything Universal right now
on not just a sturdy for me but things I
recommend to other people for this
summer as well so my most favorite blush
for summertime for a majority of all
skin types is Sun bask I absolutely love
this blush every single summer when like
the hot muds come around I find myself
pulling this out of my blush drawer and
putting it on my vanity because I just
love it so much
it has like the perfect amount of bronze
a little bit of peach and a little bit
of rose it is beautiful absolutely
beautiful once again not wearing it
today I'm doing a terrible job I'm
showing you all these products I love
I'm not wearing any of them to show you
but it's it's an absolute beautiful
blush I have used it on every skin tone
I've used it on an NC 22 an NC I would
say 55 and it's beautiful on everybody
so I'm gonna move on to my three
favorite lip products for the summer
these are all things I recently
purchased in the last like two weeks and
I'm just like obsessed with right now
I've got my mom obsessed with them too
um this is totally random but the first
ones are the buxom what are these called
buxom lip tarnishes they're made by bare
essentials these colors are just so
gorgeous so my two favorites are
extortion this is the first one I bought
and I loved it so much that I went back
and got a second one this is extortion
right there it is so pretty my mom saw
me wearing it and she ran and she bought
it to like seriously for the young girls
out there something like a
a tinted moisturizer a bronzer and this
lipstick right here is lip tarnish
mascara you are done like it's the
easiest go to summer look that there is
and then the second one is where are you
wardrobe malfunction okay and this is a
little different for me this is a baby
doll pink if you notice I don't really
do baby Pink's not cool tone Pink's I
don't like to do really cool stuff on my
mouth on my lips I like to keep it
pretty warm so but I really really like
that one I think it's beautiful
my mom was the one who convinced me to
step outside my box and get this one I'm
trying to talk and with the song as if
it's another to get all over my face so
I'm going to mention really quick if you
didn't see my last video I have to give
a shout out this is very important to me
for the last two summers three summers
two summers I have to have a sunless
tanner because I do not sit on the Sun a
lot I do not go to tanning beds it's
just not my thing I used to do it not
anymore so I may be in the Sun maybe
maybe maybe once a week with just like
my family hanging out but I'm not like
laying out I'm like playing with my
muses at the pool and I'm also in the
shade so when it comes to getting a tan
I definitely have to fake it
million-dollar tan is my absolute
favorite this is the spray it's super
dark this is the lotion it's clear and
this you rub on like you know once a day
once every two or three days and this is
going to give you much more of a gradual
beautiful natural tan where this is like
bah boom you are a different race I have
to say it mention this before this is
the body buffer the tingly peppermint
scrub I don't know if you guys that
peppermint I / o I personally am a
peppermint freak I love everything
peppermint like candles lotions
moisturizers scrubs like quiet love
peppermint so I love this stuff it's an
exfoliator for the body so amazing and
yours post exfoliate before you use the
product so that's what that is for I
still have my
pawn code for that Jacklyn and all
lowercase is the coupon code for that
yes for a discount on million dollar tan
I'll put the links below
but it's my faith okay and then after
that sticking with the tanning thing I
don't have a cap and that drives me
crazy but this is the Sally Hansen salon
airbrush links water-resistant medium
glow it's like rubbing off such an
awesome product this is nothing
permanent and it's not going to last all
day long but you just shake it up spray
it on your legs
take your hands rub it in and it covers
your legs so much like I know Kim
Kardashian has psoriasis and she was
posting all these pictures of one leg
with this stuff on and one leg not with
it on and it completely covered up her
psoriasis and just evens everything out
it looks beautiful
my mom she uses it a lot I got her
really into it and she's in her 50s and
when she wears it everyone's always like
your legs are so pretty so it's a great
product once again it's not going to tan
you it's only going to stay on until you
shower so keep that in mind okay and
then the body obviously SPF we're going
to be in the Sun we have to protect our
skin right now I'm not one of those
crazy people that's like SPF 70 no
cancer
like we like to get its hand we like we
like to look nice but I am about
protecting your skin and doing what's
best for you you know your physical
health and mental I'm a little crazy
though okay so I have two right here
these are my two favorite band brands
banana boat and copper tone the reason
why is because I have judged the
ingredients and I think these are the
best over Hawaiian Tropic and Australian
gold and I camera via the ones I have
spent a lot of time judging the
ingredients and these look like they
have the best ingredients in them as
opposed to the other brands so I don't
have oil and the reason why I try to
avoid oil is because if you get like the
spray Australian gold oil or whatever it
is literally straight min or oil and
it's going to dry you out and clog your
pores and it's going to irritate my skin
personally and it just doesn't
little good it just feels like nasty oil
whoo hair I'm getting hot my roots are
intense okay so what I do is I have an S
kiss eight and spf15 judging what time
of the day it is where I'm going to be I
put on my SPF and if I want to get a tan
and that's why I'm focusing on I then go
in with coconut oil I know it sounds
random but coconut oil is so amazing for
skin is so good for your body inside and
out it's going to act just like any
other oil to want to attract the Sun it
has no SPF in it though this is made for
cooking with moisturizing with whatever
you want it's all natural organic
amazing so I'll put on like a 15 on my
body for the protection and then I'll
put this really healthy oil on top for
the Sun to come to my body and give me a
tan instead of using a straight oil I
hope that makes sense it's just my way
of avoiding the really bad ingredients
and the skin irritation and the maturing
that I can do to my skin and you get it
all the damage so that's my way of
making myself feel better it doesn't
feel as nasty doesn't stick forever like
the other mineral oil ones do and it's
so much better for you so a couple more
things I rarely talk about hair products
but I just love love love these um this
is a heat protectant this is by kenra
platinum it is a breast-cancer addition
I got these things up in Chicago heat
protectants are so important the summer
time just don't forget use it before
blow-drying your hair curling your hair
straightening your hair even going out
in the Sun another trick that I learned
when I was a little girl is to let your
hair down in like the shower or the bath
tub or whatever before you go swimming
or go outside because your hair is kind
of like a sponge and if you get it wet
with good water and then you jump into
the chlorine it won't make your color
bleed it won't damage and give you split
ends like chlorine contend to do so
that's a little trick but he protect it
is very very important to me especially
this time of year because even from
letting my hair air dry I'll give myself
a little heat protectant just because
I'm going to be out in the heat in the
Sun
two more things is the bed head head
rush this is a shine spray it is
absolutely amazing you guys are always
asking me why my hair is shiny and this
is it I love it I love how it smells I
love that doesn't make my hair greasy
okay I'm like a cloud of the stuff
around me right now this is by the ball
this is sold at Ulta once again I don't
have a cap I don't know why it just
bothers me this is flexible and super
flexible hold supple okay I don't know
hairspray spray modeling I don't
understand safe for color treated hair
humidity recessed resistant hair sprays
long-lasting hold I love this hairspray
whenever I curl my hair I used to see
neatly afterwards except I've forgotten
to today because it's falling down but
this hairspray is awesome it smells so
good it's not super expensive love it
okay also I know you guys gonna ask
about my hair because you always do it's
so funny this right here is a mini wand
I use this to curl my hair today this is
my favorite one to use especially in the
summertime it gives such like cute tight
beachy waves it's not like super loose
where you're like flowing in the wind
but I think it is just so cute I love
the way this looks this is with a 19
millimeter wand I believe by new me
I do have a promo code that is still
available I've had it for a while now
it's just new me style for any classic
wand I use this one and this one these
are my two favorites for the summer I
will put the link below for these things
my code has a humungous discount it is
huge it's like 60% off or something so
I'll put that below if you guys are
interested in these but I really like
these tight barrels as opposed to the
huge ones for the summertime and I get
so many compliments on my hair whenever
I roll it like this so that's that last
thing is a pair of high-waisted
shorts now if you know me you know that
I have the hardest time finding a good
pair of high-waisted denim cutoff shorts
everything makes my butt look so weird
and awkward and just like big and out of
place or I look like I'm wearing mom
jeans it just doesn't work on my body I
have tried every place you can think of
order them online I've gone into every
store I've gone really really cheap
stores I've got the thrift shops like
I've tried all can't find it until I
found for the highness which is this
random website online so awesome the
shorts fit me perfect it has a little
like emblem on the back I showed this in
my last video I believe they're all like
curled up because I wear them so much I
love the stud details they're all so
cute I'm gonna have to get more I just
absolutely love them they're
high-waisted in all the right ways they
don't come up like super super high
where they're cutting off your
circulation they're the perfect length
they cover up your butt in the back I
show these on Instagram a couple of
times I love them so much you don't feel
like hoochie mama when you're wearing
them they're perfect last but not least
I just want to remind you guys about the
bed but I always say Bed Bath Bath and
