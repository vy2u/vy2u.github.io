a super easy summer makeup tutorial for
you
this is not something that I would
typically wear if you know me you know I
love my warm colors my warm Browns and
my goals my copper's but today we are
working with all cool tones so we have
cool tone eye cheeks and lips so this is
very outside of my comfort zone but I
figured that I had to make this into a
makeup tutorial because yesterday I wore
this in a hurry when I was running out
the door and my husband would not stop
complimenting my makeup all day long so
I figured that that was a good sign and
I should do a story for you because it
is so super easy and there's some great
techniques in this that you beginners
can really use to advance yourself and
makeup artistry so this is very
appropriate for all ages anyone who's
watching my video you can do this
there's nothing like crazy about this I
just think it's very appropriate for
summertime so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will be seeing
you soon bye
first thing I'm doing is priming my face
I'm using benefit stay flawless in my
opinion this is the only primer I've
ever used that truly works then I'm
going to go in with something like a BB
cream or a tinted moisturizer these are
my two favorite products for the
summertime as far as foundation goes
with this primer you want to work in
sections so you do one cheek and then
you blend in I am using the Smashbox BB
cream here and I'm using shade light you
work cheek by cheek and then you go on
immediately over top because this primer
does dry very quickly this is how
benefit apparantly design this primer to
work and I'm not going to mess with it
because it really is amazing this primer
makes your makeup not budge it's like
glue and as always I using the Sigma
flat top kabuki brush this is the f80
can't live without it best foundation
brush in the world I have tried so many
in these last couple of months and still
to this day I cannot say one bad thing
about it this is my favorite foundation
brush ever then I'm going to go in with
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer I'm using
shade nw20 I'm using a damp Beauty
Blender and I'm going to Pat this all
under my eyes and on top to conceal for
the eyeshadow that we are going to use
now in this summertime I go a little bit
lighter with BB Creams and tinted
moisturizers on the skin but then I
still use a full coverage concealer hi
hubby I still use a full coverage
concealer under the eyes because
recently I have had very bad dark
circles and I still want something full
coverage so I use that to kind of even
out so full coverage under the eyes and
then light coverage on the rest of the
face then after that I'm going to use
the Mac mineralize skinfinish this is in
shade light because right now I am very
very fair I have not used my
million-dollar tan which is a self
tanner and quite some time then I'm
going to use this stark white powder
it's a Mac Pro and I'm going to Pat it
underneath my eye with a sigma
highlighting brush I'm just going to
lightly Pat am I actually dusting I'm
just patting because if you actually
dust your brush you will move around the
foundation and concealer like I'm doing
right now I'm doing that intentionally
because some things won't blend it out
then I'm going to go in with makeup geek
mishima eyeshadow and this is a sigma
brush i don't know the number of it I
will put it down below this is the one
that I've told you guys has replaced my
Mac 242 can't live without this brush
all my gosh so I was patting this all
over my lid as you can see I am NOT
going above the crease and I'm focusing
this on the inner corner then I'm going
to use the Urban Decay Naked basics
palette and I'm going to take naked 2
right in the center I'm going to use
again a sigma brush this is just like
the Mac 217 a big fluffy brush and I'm
just going to dust it in the outer
corner of my eye so this is a cool tone
transition shade so if you have pink
undertones and you are not you know a
warmer person where you have yellow
golden the olive tones this is a great
color for you to use as a transition
color for all of your makeup and
eyeshadow needs then I'm going to go in
with crave that matte black I'm going to
use this pencil brush any pencil brush
will do by the way the ones that I'm
using right now with the gold tips the
ferals are from the Sigma extravaganza
collection oh just elegance anyways I'm
going to just lightly push this into my
lash line on that outer corner and as
you can see I'm really taking my time
buffing it up and then whatever is left
over my brush I'm not picking up any
additional black whatsoever I just
string it in along the lash line I'm
being very careful with this keeping
everything really low and then I go in
with that same brush with nothing on it
and buff it out so this black kind of
turns into a grey and I'm just keeping
it really really low on the lash line
and the only part that I'm flicking it
up as the outer corner
remember do not buff this any higher in
the crease you want to keep this very
low in the crease so this gives you a
really natural smoky daytime eye so once
again you start in that lashline as low
as you can and then you kind of pull up
an outer corner if you want you can
leave it just like that and then go in
with some liner that's beautiful but I'm
doing it a little bit differently today
and just dragging along that entire lash
line and then just smoking it out with
that brush remember don't put anything
additional on that brush otherwise it
can overwhelm it a little bit then I'm
going to curl my lashes I'm using a Mac
eyelash
curler that I've had for years and years
any lash curler will of course do and
I'm so sorry my camera was going in and
out of focus this whole time and I
wasn't really paying attention I was
moving very quickly but this is the
L'Oreal voluminous mascara the original
come to find out of all the expensive
mascaras I own that's my favorite I'm
using Venus that color that you saw all
the way to the left again in the Naked
basics palette with another Sigma brush
that comes in the extravaganza palette
and I mean you know not palette the
brush set and I'm going to highlight my
inner corners in that teardrop just for
more of a pop then I'm using the
Anastasia brow Wiz pencil brow is not
pencil just the brow is and I'm going to
fill in just the outer tail of my brows
and drag it in very lightly and
naturally I'm not going to fill it in as
I normally do because I want this to be
more soft I don't want this to be an
intense harsh look and then I'm going to
use the anasazi a brow gel and it's
going to look really wet and crispy but
it'll dry a okay then once again I'm
going to use that same Venus shade and
just highlight under my brow with that
same amazing brush that I use all over
my lid then I'm going to go back and add
in just a little bit more of that naked
color just because I felt like it wasn't
enough as I was sitting back looking at
myself so just dusting a tiny bit more
on then I'm going to use Mac's boot
black this is totally optional yesterday
I'd even do this but I just thought why
not so I'm just going to take a tiny bit
of this and just shred it right along my
lash line literally just press it down
on the lashes and drag I'm not going to
go on the skin and make a harsh line and
then let that dry and do your bottom
mascara so that's what I'm doing right
now again with the L'Oreal original
voluminous it's an eighth hand bottle I
will put all the information for it
below now after that's dry with no
additional product on my brush I'm just
going to drag it on that lash line a
second time and this will smoke it out
even more and just give the eyes more
definition and make your lashes look
longer and fuller then I'm going to use
Tarte Amazonian clay blush this is
implicitly it's a babydoll pink with a
little bit of coral tiny bits you know
I have to have a little bit of coral
somewhere in my makeup and then I'm just
going to buff it out with any brush once
again I'm so sorry I'm out of focus you
guys this is again a sigma brush and I'm
just going to buff it out and then I'm
going to go in with this limited edition
mac mineralize skinfinish it's called a
door it's out right now with the new
collection and I'm going to use this
just to go over top just to give me more
like a highlighted effect this is such a
pretty color it's got some cool tones
and some warm tones in it but it's
coming out more cool on my skin it is so
pretty and then the mary lou manizer by
the balm of course the most amazing
highlighter of all time and I'm going to
just run this along the tops of my
cheekbones for a highlight again this is
optional to really oily you may not want
to do this but I love this especially in
the summertime drag it along the chin
the very top of the mouth of the Cupid's
bow and it'll just bring more life to
you now I'm going to use Mac mineralized
lipstick oh gosh I love this color so
much this is divine choice mineralized
rich lipstick and you guys know how to
prom lipstick but I'm actually not using
a liner for a purpose this summer it's a
very big trend not to use liner but to
have more of a blown-out bold lip as
opposed to an intense perfectly shaped
bold lip it just looks very feminine and
soft and then I'm going to go in with
Mac's snob lip gloss but you could use
one like the buxom lavender Cosmo which
was the other one I had absolutely
gorgeous I've been loving the buxom line
recently absolutely beautiful and then
I'm just going to set my entire face
with the Urban Decay chill makeup
setting spray fan yourself off and you
are good to go I will see you guys soon
and thank you so much for watching bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
