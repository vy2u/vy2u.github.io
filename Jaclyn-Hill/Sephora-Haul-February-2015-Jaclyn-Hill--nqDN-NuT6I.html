Sephora haul let me just a crazy story
this is the first haul I've uploaded in
five months what five months out on
which is crazier the fact I have a
little haul in five months or the fact
that I haven't gone makeup shopping in
five months like so weird I honestly
just got to a point in late September
where I was like I'm satisfied I'm good
I'm more than enough makeup I'm a little
overwhelmed to be quite honest so the
past few months I have just enjoyed my
collection and been telling myself that
I don't need more and because you know
you constantly feel like you need more
more more more more all the time no
matter what area of life it is and I
just I'm trying to just be satisfied
with what I currently have so that's why
I've been doing for the past few months
I've given tons of makeup away it's been
a weight off my chest so after five
months of mouth shopping I did some
damage you already know I did some
damage sick I will be doing a limited
collection soon there's a lot of a go
back there so you guys can be
overwhelmed with me that will be coming
up in the next few weeks it felt so good
to be back in Candyland
today yeah see here this is it this is
my full you see this looks like I bought
nothing are you kidding looking for
someone badass we see that I could make
foam but no of course like what is this
well order first thing I got which is
not even mean I wanted to get I was like
oh how do you want to spend my money on
this but I had to get another Issey
Miyake perfume I talked about this in my
most recent favorites and the cap is
broken and it shoots perfume out
everywhere and it's a hot mess swipes
how to get anyone because the cat was
broken I hate spending money other
things I don't actually like you're I'm
saying it's like why doesn't a break
then I picked up two of the newer shades
from the Too Faced melted liquefied long
wear lipstick collection these
originally came out months back and I
really like the formulation of them but
the colors were very bold and very
bright and I typically am NOT a bold lip
kind of gal on the day-to-day I
typically like my neutrals and I knew
that my pinks and those type of shades
so super excited when I thought these
were coming out I actually had even
swatch them yet because
Sephora was madness today I didn't even
have time just swatch it in the store so
I actually have no idea what they look
like so you're gonna get to see them
with me for the first time okay let me
see please be pretty please be pretty I
don't want to have to turn you oh my god
I died
oh okay so melted sugar so far is
friggin gorgeous like I love that and
this one is called melted Chihuahua okay
that's kind of wrong melted Chihuahua
like what No
oh that is so pretty I thought I was
going to be a little bit more rosy but
this is still so pretty
so that is a melted sugar and that is
melted Chihuahua I didn't want to say
that melted Chihuahua like is anybody
else feeling about disturbing hundreds
of you guys have been tweeting me about
viz this new tint in oil
YSL nourishing lip oil color enhancer I
really don't know what it is but because
so many of you been tweeting me telling
me that I need to get it I just trusted
you and I was like okay and I got the
color I rose you I don't know what it
does so I can't tell you because like I
said for was so crazy today I did not
have time to do anything like I was just
grabbing things like throwing it in my
basket there were so many people it was
just such madness it feels like
straight-up oil and I'll get back to you
much you know how I feel but I'm excited
but it's called the Tintin oil because
anything that's nourishing moisturizing
oily I'm all about that life I heard
this one online and this is another wise
all product hung on so much money just
like I've been pulling these out of like
why did we spend this much money again
this is the YSL glossy stain in number
18 I don't know if this is new but in my
mind it's new so I needed it and it just
looks so pretty I love these glossy
stains but I only have I think two of
them because hello there why I sell they
are expensive um you're barely gonna be
able to see on the back of my hand I bet
right there I have noticed that watching
them does not show as much on a hand as
they do on the lips now because this is
a pale color I don't know
this is going to show it when to lift at
all but the other two that I have I
absolutely love them they're glossy and
they are stained so it's just very
different and I love the way they wear
they are super similar to UM the lore'l
stains in the drugstore I will say like
I honestly wouldn't spend your money on
this if you're like debating it go to
the drugstore get the l'oreal ones
because they are super super similar
just being honest and then I got another
why I sell products I told you I did
some damage this is the eval of sheer
candy and I have two of these and I love
them I will put these on when I'm not
wearing makeup because they're super
sheer I just like this color because
it's very mommy and you'll see as I put
it on like that just barely any color
shows up and I just really like these
four days when you're not wearing makeup
or let's say you're baring we're wearing
fairly any makeup and you don't want to
do it a bold lip but you just want a
little color these are like ideal I love
them and I don't know of anyone else
that have this formulation or anything
close which used to paint our Mandalay
or to get this but I've looked for other
companies that make something similar
space which is a very sheer wash of
color and very moisturizing and I can't
find it so I love these this is my third
color that I own and I've almost gone
through the first two because they're
just so perfect when you don't want a
bold lip so Marc Jacobs reformulated
their lipsticks Oh hallelujah because I
tried other his lipsticks when his line
first came out and I was like but today
when I went in my friend Marisa she
works in my Sephora so she always like
takes me around and shows me what's new
tells me what's great tell me was not
worth it and she told me that this was
worth it so Marisa I trust you so I've
got the shade strange magic from Marc
Jacobs and it says on the box Marc
Jacobs new news sheer lip gel so I'm
excited to try this the packaging looks
like this it's like a very interesting
color honestly it's like a berry I'm
going to be honest
blase kind of baby-barf nude but that's
okay I'm not judging the packaging
because what's on the inside looks
gorgeous do you see this beautiful baby
pink so I picked this one up because you
know I love my pink
anytime I try a new collection or new
makeup line I always go with in neutrals
because I know neutrals it's what I love
it's what I wear all the time so I feel
like I can really judge a formula by
trying the neutrals first so it looks
like this right here on the back of the
hand it's a beautiful baby pink and it
says it's a gel and it definitely feels
different it feels very moisturizing it
has pretty much like no scent at all
I got the new naked um the new Urban
Decay Naked skin
weightless complete coverage concealer I
am super excited try this I actually
ordered this online when it first came
out i order it in the lightest shade I
don't lie when it got to my house it was
so white I was like oh oh my gosh like
it was very very light so I went back
today and I got light neutral so yeah
that looks much much better much more
like my color right there cuz I like my
consider to be a little bit lighter than
my foundation but not too much lighter
and the consistency feels like I might
fall in love and I'm a little excited
about this but when it smells it apart
I'm like I'm so weird I know but just
the way it feels it feels like jelly
just feels cool I'm excited I'm Betsy
purchasers are quite expensive I was
talked into getting them for my friends
all my fine and this one is the fresh
black tea firming over my mask it says
it's with soothing Bell do neut okay
nope I can't pronounce that anyways this
supposed to be anti-aging and it's like
an overnight mask but it feels more like
a moisturizer on the skin I love the
black tea facial mask
I bought that last year man Oh a year
and a half over a year ago and I have
been loving it for a long time so I'm
really really excited to try this
because I love the masks so much and I
love the idea of keeping something on my
face all night long I'm all about
sleeping in masks and overnight masks I
think they really do make a difference
as opposed to like a 5-10 minute mask
where I don't typically see a very big
difference in my skin I am so excited
this is like the number one thing I
notified about in this entire haul no
that's a lie
but I am really excited about this this
is a Peter Thomas Roth 24 karat gold
mask
by Marisa told me that this makes a very
big difference in your skin and it
really gives you a beautiful luminous
glow afterwards and it's supposed to be
anti-aging like it's intense
that's intense I'm excited to put this
on and be like hey go man the Heinkel
member I'm just saying if you're a true
fan of Beyonce you know all about that
Goldmember life then I picked up two
different contour kits this is a
smashbox step-by-step contour kit
I love the smashbox step-by-step contour
stick through the creams i have been
crazy crazy into cream contouring and
cream bronzing will recently like the
past month that i have it's all I've
been doing i will the video on that very
soon so i also wanted to try this
smashbox step-by-step contour kit
I feel like contour kits have been
coming out every single week anastacio
start a huge trend I believe with her
contour kit and out tons of people are
doing it so I have been pretty much
buying all then because I I want to get
the feel for them and get the feel for
what's best so I can stick with that one
and then I got the Laura Mercier
flawless contour palette and this is
cream so I'm super excited about this
right here it looks like that so you
have different I'm going to six on
my chin you have different shapes to
contour with right there and then you
have this little highlighting color as
well so they are all creams there are no
powders in this but I really like these
three shades I would definitely need
this first one right here at contour
with but I see this is excited so I'm
excited to try this because like I said
I'm all about cream contour recently I'm
like addicted right now then I got the
cover FX illuminating face primer
because I had a sick obsession with face
primers recently for the past couple of
months I've been trying every single
face primer like under the Sun because I
just want to find something that truly
makes a difference and right now I am
loving the Smashbox primer water and
also the Smashbox hydrating primer um
but I'm just always looking for
something that was really gonna make a
difference and I've tried the popular
ones at the benefit Porefessional and
the Tarte one and I didn't see I didn't
see but my issue isn't pores so a lot of
those that work for everyone else with
the whole pore filling issue that's not
really what I'm looking for but once I
find a primer that is like I will let
you know I got the Urban Decay Naked
skin also different
and powder foundation I got this because
I'm always looking for powders to set my
t-zone area um I a lot of times will use
a highlighting powder or I'll get a
powder as a foundation and buy a share
two lighter because I like that area to
be a little bit lighter like that and
underneath my eyes just for a more
naturally defined highlighted look I
wanted to try this powders because I was
feeling it in Sephora and it just feels
so creamy and the coverage looks
incredible so I did get this in my shade
as opposed to a highlighting shade
because I swear to try it I used to use
the Mac mineralize skinfinish all the
time to set that area but that can
sometimes break up on me even though I
love that has it a nice glowy effect
sometimes it just breaks up and just
does not look good after a few hours so
that's why I think that little baby I
got the Kat Von D everlasting face
shaper blush and this is in the shade
heart 2 gram this color is super
different from anything I own at least I
thought I feel and I think that it's so
pretty it has a nice shimmer in it and
it's just a really pretty like rosy ooh
rosy purpley love that is that so pretty
so much coverage and assuring it is just
gorgeous I'm super picky about my
blushes in the way the shimmer looks
because I don't like to look frosty or
glittery it has to have just like a nice
sheen and this is just gorgeous so I
just feel like it was necessary in my
collection so I don't want anything like
that then last but not least I came home
to this bad boy waiting for me my front
door and I was so excited this is the
new anastasia beverly hills contour
cream series and i haven't even opened
it up yet so I went over to IRA joy it
so it has three different palettes right
here with all contour cream colors this
is like heaven to me right now and like
look at all the different shades in
there for different skin tones oh my god
suicide so I would be the light one I'm
sure I would be the light one I go to so
excited oh come pray oh my gosh look at
this look at us oh my god I'm so excited
Obie's feel nice oh my god yes I'm so
excited right now my gosh look how nice
this blend look at the darkest color and
the lightest palette and I'll show you
how it blends out like you can see how
it's nice and creamy oh yes so nice I'm
so excited try these I will be using
these when I do my makeup tomorrow I
can't wait I've been so excited to needs
to launch I don't even know when they
launch exactly I know that they sent
them out to everybody today um like on
our PR list I'll like the instagramers

getting them today and posting pictures
