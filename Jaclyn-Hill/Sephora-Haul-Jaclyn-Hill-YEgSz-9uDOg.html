Sephora haul and let's just before
jumping in the video let's just disclaim
the hair okay it's super messy and I
just I wasn't committed today I wasn't
committed to being a woman or an adult I
was just like I don't want to do it that
maybe do it so I got to own that makeup
and I was like we're done okay to say
the least
Aunt Flo she's being a little bitch
right now so I have the right to be a
little sassy this is my moment okay okay
I honestly just want to be on the couch
right now like overdosing out ice cream
and watching friends with pretzels salty
sweet and not too much to ask
is anybody else obsessive pitch-perfect
I know that has nothing to do with this
video right now but I am so obsessed
with the second pitch-perfect like I
can't handle it the first one I was like
oh that's cute love it but that was it
you know I've only seen the first one a
couple of times in the few years that
it's been out the second one obsessed
I've seen it three times in theaters now
and I do not remember the last time that
I saw a movie more than once in theaters
like when I was a teenager but I have
gone to see it three times and that in
love with it I honestly want to gain 50
pounds and dye my hair blonde just to be
fat Amy
because I feel like she is like my soul
sister I love her so much
okay so let's dive in I had to of course
just get like a few things I was running
low on that was just absolutely
necessary like urban decay chill makeup
setting spray this is probably no joke
like the 8th bottle of this I bought but
I'm telling you I don't know how to live
without our educational makeup setting
spray it's the only setting spray that I
feel like it actually hydrates and set
mine at the same time like mac fix+
that's not actually a setting spray more
than anything that just going to make
you look very dewy and it's going to
make your powder kind of set and look
more natural in your skin this on the
other hand I feel like it actually sets
my makeup to the point that it doesn't
crease as much and it does last longer
and look better so I can't live without
our educational makeup setting spray if
you are more oily I would definitely
suggest to not go for that one and go
for like the all nighter one or like
model on a bottle Scandanavia one of
those but if you are normal to dry every
decay chalega setting spray Dulli
magnifique
so I finally got the Marc Jacobs Daisy
perfume I get like little roller balls
all the time and like little tiny like
sample sizes but for some reason I have
not bought like a full
my bottle of this since John and I got
married which is just so weird to me
because Mar Jacobs Daisy is still one of
my favorite scents of all time and like
I have some friends that make fun of me
and they're like really Marc Jacobs easy
like that sounds like a teenager smell
and I'm like girl get on my face this is
the sense that I wore on Jean Rhys
wedding day and I drenched myself in it
and still to this day every single time
I spray it I get like this like euphoria
for my wedding day I've mentioned this
before and I just love it so much so I
try not to wear it too often I try to
only spray it like once a month or so
because it's just like it's such a
special scent to me and like that period
of our life like John and I were just
kind of like young and silly and stupid
and rebellious and we were always like
wearing like leather jackets and like
ripped up jeans you're like sound cool
and so whenever I spray this I always
think of my wedding day and our leather
jackets I don't know why I just I love
my Jacobs disease a special for him to
me
I'm another fresh cream body lotion by
philosophy this is actually no joke
probably my 10th to 12th bottle of this
lotion I love it so much
John loves it so much it's just oh it
smells so good even though I couldn't
even smell it because this thing was
still on it but I just know that it
smells good oh so Marc Jacobs came out
with new lip glosses which I was super
excited about when I saw him in Sephora
because I love the other Marc Jacobs lip
glosses Georgie's sleep yearning for my
charity snoring so here something that
is not me passing gas dog anyways I love
the original Marc Jacobs lip glosses but
they leak they I don't know what it is
but the cap it leaks and it will like
destroy your purse and everything in it
it's a hot mess Marc Jacobs really needs
to really like do that packaging so when
I saw that they came out with lip
glosses that have like a more secure cap
I love like oh hi I'm about this life so
I got two shades of course I don't like
colorful lip glosses like you will never
catch me buying a red lip gloss or a
burgundy lip gloss or you know what I'm
saying because they just believe so
easily on your lips it is a very rare
occasion I were will wear a lip glosses
bright in color and I'm wearing
right color like anastacio or good
lipgloss I love it so much but that's
because that color is so ridiculously
gorgeous I make the exception and the
fact that it's a gloss otherwise I don't
do bright glosses I only buy neutral
glosses and I will do bright lipsticks
in case you care you guys are probably
like I don't give a tiny rats ass tell
me where that's from tell me where that
line is from I'll be your best friend
I'll give you hugs and cupcakes so I got
two shades for Marc Jacobs I got pink
flamingo and I got sugar sugar so pink
flamingo is it's a nude pink guys let's
just get real but this is one swatch and
I really just liked the way it looked
because it's so hard to find glosses
that are glossy a lot of glosses
nowadays they're so overly pigmented
that when you apply it you're like this
is a lipstick and a gloss form and I
miss glosses that are just glossy I want
a glossy gloss Kris Jenner queen of
glossy lips I swear to god I'm like what
is her makeup artist using on her lips
because her lips look what so this is
sugar sugar I'll swatch it for you this
one is super nude which you know me I
like pink flamingo and sugar sugar I'm
excited about these because they seem
like a glassy block but I have not
played with them yet so I'll let you
know and of course they're expensive
they're Marc Jacobs so I'll get back to
let you know they're actually worth the
money or if it's just like moi more
goodies let's see goodies kidneys I got
another naked skin concealer because I
am already out of mine like literally I
just used the very last of it this
morning I like ran out halfway through
and I am the shade medium light neutral
that is the color that I use that is
like the color that pretty much is just
barely a highlight on me if I want to
like highlight with the concealer I will
use the shade light but medium light
neutral is the one that I use day-to-day
absolutely well this concealer it is
hands-down my favorite concealer I've
ever used ever I was so excited to smell
this perfume because I love Burberry
sense but at the same time I can't
really wear them because they're just so
like warm on me and I can't
but you guys but warm scent smell like
Bo on me like they smell so good in the
bottle like flower bomb smells so girl
in the bottle it smell so good on my
sister and any time I do meet-and-greet
so many of you that I hug I'm like
flower bomb mm-hmm it smells so yummy
spray it on me wait 10 minutes and
you're like it smells like Bo it's not
cute so I am like super picky with my
perfumes I don't want them to be too
warm in their scent so this is the
Burberry Brit rhythm and this is the
floral one yes this is the floral all
did toilet it is so yummy I wish you
guys could just smell it cuz it's so
hard to talk about sets on camera the
perfect amount of like warmth fresh and
floral it's too hard to explain on
camera bliss smell it for yourself get a
sample I'm not gonna sit here and bore
you because I suck describe you sense
but it's good okay so then I went a
little like bronzer crazy and you would
think that I have more than half
bronzers right now but I'm just on this
bronzer kick so enough you different
spray bronzers and the reason being is
because my good friend who is also a
makeup artist she was telling me that
she is obsessed with what obsessed with
this girl Ain terracotta bronzing powder
mist and it has a sunscreen of SPF 10 in
it I honestly you guys don't know
anything about this she's coming over
later today so I'm gonna be like help me
Mom
but she used to work at Sephora and she
told me that every single day that she
was walking to Sephora she would spray
this so I was like okay so I got the
terracotta spray I'm super curious I
have not I didn't even know this existed
but apparently it's years old she works
four years ago um I got mine in shade
medium zero two so honestly I don't I
don't know how I'm gonna use this
because like I said I don't know
anything about it I'm gonna oh let me
see
so again I'm gonna have her come over
here today and kind of walk me through
this because I don't want to waste us
cuz this is expensive and again I have
never seen anyone use I don't know
anything about it so we'll find out and
then I got one more because again I'm
like so intrigued by these spray
bronzers right now and this is the
Sephora brand one I've never used
anything Sephora brand I don't think but
again this intrigued me and this is just
the exact same thing it's for Faison
body says it's a perfectionist airbrush
bronzer no gas and oil free so just want
to see what these are like
whoa that's kind of fun but the
Terracotta one I think I like the color
better but like I can see it right there
on my arm
hey workout that's not looking the best
so then I got a powder bronzer because
this was a new Smashbox bronzer and I
really wanted to try it because I love
Smashbox is original bronzer and this is
called bronze lights deep matte bronzing
powder so it looks like this it comes in
a square shape which I like squares it
looks like this right here and the color
just looks really nice and when I was
playing with in Sephora it seemed super
smooth and very blendable so I'm excited
to try this site like I said I loved the
original Smashbox bronzer so I'm looking
forward trying this one as well and then
this is the product I think I'm most
excited for out of everything this was
the reason I went to Sephora was because
my friend who works there told me you
have to come in and get this and I was
like done this is a new YSL cream
bronzer ah so excited it dry guys you
guys know how much I love the Chanel
Soleil de tan so late and a Chanel cream
bronzer whatever it's a cream bronzer
this Genomics okay and it's good so I'm
really excited to try this one I got
mine in this is the number three that I
got mine and I'm not sure if this is
going to work but that's the number that
I chose it seems super creamy in the pan
the way it goes on it's kind of like a
mousse it feels museet on your hand then
when it goes on it really sheared out
and it blends really evenly as you can
see it looks very natural I don't know
why my hands look so much lighter than
my face in my body because that's better
back there because I don't know why my I
promised my body is all the same color
but for some reason whatever
first of all problems moving on yeah I
am extremely excited to get my brush
into this product and try it to see how
it works on the skin I love cream
bronzers I swear cream bronzers are one
of my favorite products in the makeup
world like I just love them so super
excited about this
and I will let you guys know if it works
and if it's worth the moolah and a last
but not least I got the mother lode of
blushes okay
when I got online and saw that Clinique
came out with more colors of their cheek
pop blushes I was so excited they came
out with like 10 new shades I would say
at least so I got four and I felt like
okay four is a good number even though I
honestly guys I wanted to buy every
single one of them so I sat there for
like five minutes - beating what shapes
to get so I got four different color so
the first color I got is called melon
pop it's like a super pale kind of peach
shade so pretty for summer
I got pansy pop which is like this
gorgeous pale lavender I love this color
this color blush is so beautiful if
you're working with corals or like blue
so if you have like blue on the eye and
coral on the lips this is like so far
the cheeks if you really want to do
something very fresh and springy and fun
love love lavender shades like this so
pansy pop this blush right here is
pretty typical for me this is definitely
a Jacqueline color this is fig pop right
here and this is like a warm kind of
copperish brown color oh love it so much
this is definitely to be the one that I
use the most but I'm trying guys try to
get my comfort zone or break habits if
you haven't noticed because you only get
about yours now and then the last one I
got is super different for me this is
called Cola pop and I was so excited
when I saw this so I literally don't own
anything like this Shea which is very
exciting so you go Clinique bringing me
something different and new into my
collection this one I love the name that
it's Cola because it really does kind of
look like coca-cola like it's definitely
like a ready brown shade it's so
different that's what gorgeous on girls
with really darker really tan skin
beautiful so excited about that shade
alright so that completes this haul I
feel like I went through that so quickly
because it looks like so much product
but I feel like I like sped right
through everything you know this video
will probably still manage to be 45
minutes look I don't know how that
happens but I'm so excited I get to
finally play with this stuff now because
I went shopping like almost a week ago
and all this stuff has just been sitting
in the Sephora bag and I've been like no
do not give in to temptation so now that
I have filmed
get to finally dig into everything and
play with it so I'm super excited about
that all right thank you so much for
hanging out me and watching this video
you guys I love you and I'll be seeing
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
