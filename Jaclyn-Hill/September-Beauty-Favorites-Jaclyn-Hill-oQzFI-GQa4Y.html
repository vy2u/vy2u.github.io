my September beauty favorites and I'm so
happy to be doing this because I skipped
last month's beauty favorites which is
not like me to skip a monthly favorites
there was like a year and a half there
sorry I think I have a hair stuck on my
face and I keep pitching it and it's
very uncomfortable um there was like a
year and a half there where I did not
miss one month like the past six months
I've missed two which is not OK so I
need to get more on top of it but the
month before last I was gone for like
two full weeks maybe fifteen days and so
I was just like out of sorts not in my
element not in my environment not trying
new stuff here I'm saying so I didn't
really have anything to talk about but
this month on the other hand I do I had
a lot to talk about I narrow it down to
like my top favorites that I've been
like in love with otherwise this video
literally would have been 45 minutes
long so I had so much stuff I apologize
right now I'm home alone and the dogs
are in some sort of mood if you can hear
the situation I'm really really sorry if
you can hear them like barking or making
noise I keep like trying to get them out
of the room but they just keep coming
back pressure the door they scratch on
it like mom why do you abandon us do you
hear them usually when I film I have
John like take them on a walk take them
with him or John is like doing something
in the house I have to like keep the
dogs next to him but today John is gone
playing drums and so I have the dogs and
it's just ah hopefully you animal lovers
understand Georgie I clap them like when
they're being bad I go no but I think
that they think that I'm cheering them
on because it just like intensifies it
and I'm like when they're like hmm I
should probably mention this as one of
my favorites for the month even though I
was like not planning on it I'm just
genuinely drinking this right now this
is these Starbucks toasted graham latte
I drink my decaf because as I said
million times I don't drink caffeine um
I don't even know how to describe it to
you it's just perfection it's not too
sweet not too salty it's just amazing so
if you guys are wondering it
kind of amazing drink you should try
next try the new toasted graham latte
it's incredible and it's a seasonal
drink I used to be in love with the
creme brulee latte that they had but
they got rid of it and I don't know if
like they're going to come back with it
this year I don't know what that one is
amazing too but this is so good like
anytime I pass Starbucks the past couple
weeks I'm stopping at a drive-through to
pick that up because it's just so weõll
me
so the first beauty product that I have
is this Becca primer and this I used in
my last video actually and this is
called the Becca backlight priming
filter you guys know the I like
ride-or-die it for the makeup forever
primer like the radiance and the
hydrating one I have gone back and forth
and used those primary for the past few
months
also the smoothie one as well and I
really loved them but the past week and
a half I would say maybe two weeks this
has completely overruled those primers I
have been loving this so this is going
to be ideal for those of you who are dry
who have dry skin who need more radiance
more of a glow this is not going to be
ideal for those of you who are elite or
you're trying to get a matte finish
because the fact that this does have a
luminosity in it and that is what I
absolutely love about it if you watch my
video that I did last you will be able
to see when I apply the primer on my
face initially the radiance that
immediately gives the skin but it looks
like a liquid or cream highlighter
honestly when you apply it to your face
because it's just so luminous but it's a
primer which I love also a great way to
use this is to take a pump of it and mix
it in with your foundation and that will
still help prime the skin while I'm
mixing it and with the foundation and
giving you a glove it's going to like be
more for the foundation if you know what
I mean back in my Mac days our regional
trainer used to always do that trick mix
the primer in with the foundation even
if it wasn't radiance primer that's how
she did it because she thought that it
worked better on the skin so that's a
little trick that I picked up from her
back in the day and I love that trick so
mixing this and with the foundation will
give you even more of a luminous glow so
I have been loving this next I have two
foundations that I have been going back
and forth with the past month two months
however long it's been
I'll talk about this one first because
this is the one that I discovered first
and this is the cover FX
to finish oil-free foundation I love
this foundation obviously that's why I'm
talking about in my favorites video this
is a very full coverage let me say that
again very full coverage foundation like
I'm not joking the size of a pea is all
I need for my entire face so your money
is really going a long way when you
purchase this foundation I've never used
a foundation that's this full coverage
before so you have to be careful if you
have a heavy hand because I can tend to
be heavy-handed you have to be careful
when applying this because you can
become cake face and look like you got
frosting on real quick but I personally
love this because is like a natural to a
dewy finish if your oily you're going to
think that this is straight-up
dewy but for me because I'm dry I think
it's more of a natural to dewy finish
and for those of you wondering the shade
I am in this foundation I am g4t I
actually have the shades g30 and g50 and
g30 is my pale color g50 is my really
tan color but I usually mix them
together half and half to make g---forty
next foundation is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation stick oh my god okay
so I bought this online like over like
soon as it came out I bought this online
but it just sat right there on my desk
and I didn't use it yet because that's
what happens I buy stuff it sits around
for a month and a half two months before
I even touch it because I have so much
stuff constantly coming in I'm
constantly giving away stuff and
donating stuff and it's just always a
lot up in this room so it takes me
sometimes two months to try a product
out so this had been sitting on my desk
for probably a month at that point and
one of my good friends Adrian who
currently works at Sephora and I used to
work with her at Mac she text me was
like have you tried to make it forever
HD foundation stick yet you're gonna
love it and I'm like okay well she tells
me I'm gonna love it I know I'm gonna
love it because we're just weren't there
we see each other eye to eye when it
comes to makeup so I pulled it out I
tried it and Adrienne was 100 percent
right I am 100% in love with this
foundation this is one that I have been
using for the past week or two straight
except I did use a cover of X today this
is such a beautiful foundation and I
have the fact that it's a stick it just
takes me back to like the old school
days I remember when I was like 14 years
old I had this covergirl foundation that
was so awesome like I wish they came
back with their baby was Maybelline I
don't know but it was super dewy and it
was a stick and I would drop
face and at the time obviously blend out
with my fingers and it takes me back to
that time I loved the stick foundation
so this is definitely a dewy finish it's
a medium to full coverage depending how
much you put on it to make it more of a
medium coverage I do a stripe on my chin
two stripes on my cheeks maybe three on
my cheeks if I really want to go crazy
and one like big one across my forehead
and then I applied or you can take your
brush and pick it up like this and then
apply like that whatever you prefer but
I just love this stuff again it is a
natural too dewy finish medium to full
coverage and I just love that it's
compact and it's in a stick it's just
like easy for traveling who goes in your
purse for touch-ups that kind of thing
love the sound ation okay this next
product I am so excited to talk about
number one because the profit self is
Bob and anybody who tries this is going
to just like lose their mind and become
instantly obsessed Frankie honey we're
not doing that and number two because
the fact that it is by the blissful body
and I absolutely love talking about and
supporting this company so much because
it is owned by an independent woman who
does everything on her own her family
helps her create these products fill the
bottles packaging them up themselves
ship them from their homes she's just
such an awesome lady and not to mention
she donates I think 10% of her proceeds
to women at charities to help out women
which is just so awesome so anyways I've
mentioned the blissful body body butters
before because they're my favorite body
butters but this you guys oh my god so
this is called the miracle Beauty oil
and serum my entire family is now
officially obsessed with this I'll just
say this it is all natural is all
organic it is pure oil my mom try this
before me she called me one morning is
like Jacqueline you have to try this oil
oh my gosh I woke up I swear to God my
skin looks plumped it looks ten years
younger I was like okay you sound like
an infomercial you need to calm down and
then I put it on and I call my mom I was
like oh my god mom my skin looks so
amazing like we're in love with this up
so anyways if you look at the
ingredients of like a typical beauty oil
in Sephora you are not going to find the
ingredients that this one has right here
that's why it's so amazing like this is
literally nothing but incredible
high-grade pure all natural oils so if
you look at the ingredient on the back
it says back
rated E oil can be really bad very seat
will comment it will are my little
carrot soup oil
Maricruz it will create very cheap oil
sea buckthorn oil but very seed oil well
take play with literally every amazing
oil is in this little bottle right here
and it is incredible so you guys saw a
couple videos ago I don't remember what
can makeup tutorial was but I mix this
with my foundation I believe it was the
cover FX and I have done that quite a
few times and I loved it just one little
drop is all you need and basically what
that will do is it will share out any
thick foundation it'll make it look more
dewy and more natural if you are dry
this is something that you would love a
trick that you can do with any oil
doesn't necessarily to be this one but
it's a great trick if you're dry and
you're looking for extra hydration
throughout the day take any sort of
Beauty oil drop it in to your foundation
and then apply it life-changing anyways
I will link the blissful body down below
she does a couple and I think it's my
name and that will save you 10% off but
I am in no way receiving any recognition
Commission nothing from match I do not
want to take a penny from her I don't
want anything from this so that coupon
code has my name in it but it is not in
any way like benefiting me she's just
doing that for you guys and for my
subscribers who are going to her because
I love her products so much next is this
very dirty disgusting looking sponge and
it's funny because this was clean as a
whistle the day before yesterday and
this is just two applications that made
it look disgusting but this is the Real
Techniques Beauty sponge I don't know
what it's technically called I just keep
calling it the Beauty Blender dupe
because it's replaced my Beauty Blender
I this is wet right now by the way so
when you first get it it's half the size
it's tiny and then you put it under the
sink you squeeze squeeze squeeze squeeze
lick the Beauty Blender you're going to
squeeze it probably 15 times and it's
going to expand expand expand and it's
going to get to this size take a towel
wrap it around give it a squeeze to
wring out the excess water and then
you're going to have a damp sponge it
looks just like this and it is so great
I actually think I like this one more
than the Beauty Blender and the reason
why is because of the fact that it has
this flap side right here and not just
the pointed side it was shaped only like
this
I like the Beauty Blender better because
the Beauty Blender has a
our point this one is like a little too
fat the Beautyblender is more like this
one is like squishier and fatter than
the Beautyblender the Beautyblender is
like a little bit tighter and this one
it like has a little bit more
squishiness but i like it this is an
eyeshadow but i have recently been in
love with and this is makeup geek desert
sands I've owned this forever I've used
it once or twice but all of a sudden
this past couple of weeks I'm just like
can't get enough of this I am wearing
this and creme Brule both by makeup geek
on my eyes today and those are the only
colors that you see on my lids so what I
love about this is it's just such a
beautiful camel shade it's just so
perfect for this time of year just looks
like a caramel Frappuccino it's good
it's a good color I love it this lip
gloss has been oh my god this I magnin
kidding this is the only lip gloss that
I have used for the entire month maybe
the past five or six weeks this is the
only lip gloss that I have been using
day to day like I'm not kidding and this
is NARS Chelsea girls so if you guys
remember I used to obsess over the
original NARS Chelsea girls and the pot
back in the day oh my gosh I felt like I
use that every single video it was my
favorite ever but it's like one of those
you could take off the top and like dig
your finger in the pot and apply it like
that which isn't ideal but I didn't care
cuz I loved it so much now they have it
in their new lipgloss formula which
their new gloss formula is so awesome
this is why I'm wearing on my lips right
now at the same time I haven't written
coffee so it's completely worn off but I
will show you the shade on my lips it is
it's perfect it's the perfect shade it's
a nice neutral with a little bit of
color in it it's got a little bit of
peach it's got a little bit of pink it's
got a little bit like taupe if you look
at it right there you can see it's the
perfect nude because it's not too nude
but it's not too Brown and it's not too
tan it's got like a little bit of
everything mixed in and it's just
perfect it is the perfect gloss shade
and it's glossy which I love and it's
not goober SuperDuper pigmented which
again I love because I have a love-hate
relationship with all these new glosses
that are so crazy pigmented so I'm like
what happened to glossy glosses and I
feel like this one is pretty glossy so
NARS Chelsea girls I've been in love
I talked about this in my favourites
video but I have to mention it again
because I'm not kidding I probably wore
this color not being dramatic in between
10 to 15 times more no more than that 15
to 20 times in like the past five weeks
which is a lot to wear the same lip
color over and over and over so this is
Kat Von D Lolita you can see like all
around the cap it's like already getting
dingy because I've used it so much the
one thing about these everlasting with
liquid lipsticks that I don't love which
it's rare that I talk about something I
don't love so this is kind of weird for
me but the thing that I don't love about
it is that you have to apply it several
times because they can be very patchy
have any of you guys noticed this
because this one I absolutely have to
apply it twice if I apply it once
it'll be okay there's like a spot over
here that's come like kind of fading
there's a spot over here that's darker
but if I'd go over two or three times it
looks better the darker ones are way
more intense like the dark vampy ones I
have to go over them like four times
like do the whole thing once let it dry
for 30 seconds go over again wait 30
seconds again and maybe even a fourth
time otherwise they're super super
patchy but I will say once they dry they
are probably my favorite liquid lipstick
formula other than the one that Kathleen
likes did with Oprah that is the best no
joke and be best sequel lipstick I've
ever put on my lips in my life I've worn
it twice and oh my god like I cannot it
I'm not kidding I can't believe I don't
know what they did what kind of magical
powers they have all open their liquid
lipstick but Oprah cosmetics I've only
tried the one that Kathleen did but oh
my gosh so good but next to that the
everlasting ones by Kat Von D it's a
little bit of a biatch to apply it but
once you have it on it lasts all day it
doesn't get crazy dry and it doesn't
give you the disgusting but whole lips
that some of the other liquid lipsticks
and the cosmetic industry can you know
I'm saying I talked about that but way
too long I am sorry you guys next we
have actually we have all cheek products
left okay so next is a blush from NARS
and I use this in my most recent
tutorial and this is in the shade lustre
this is what I'm wearing on my cheeks
today
a along with a contour shade and a
highlight but this is lustre and I am so
in love with this color recently I can't
even deal let me give you a good little
swatch it's kind of similar to like a
Mac warm soul in the sense that it has a
really beautiful bronzy peachy glow with
some gold shimmer in it it just looks
beautiful especially for this time of
year if you're looking for a really
pretty natural looking blush that's
neutral and can pretty much go with
anything I would really suggest a blush
like NARS luster because it really is
just so easy for everyday it's a
beautiful shape I mentioned this blush
and my fall favorites as well but I
absolutely had to talk about it one more
time because the fact that I have been
using it so much these two blushes I
have gone back and forth back and forth
between the two of them for the past
couple of weeks and I cannot get enough
of this color I have said it before and
I will say again I swear to you I am I'm
not kidding I own over a hundred blushes
it's sad but it's true I do not own a
blush that is like this one like at some
point they all start to look the same
this one though really makes its mark
and my makeup collection collection
because it is so individual and unique
in its own way and it is so crazy
pigmented like are you kidding me again
you really get your money's worth
because of the fact that when you apply
it I'm not kidding I take my brush I go
and I go and I dust off the excess and
then I apply it like just one little is
all you need it is by Giorgio Armani it
is the shade two hundred and Rogi no I
believe you've still unsure about how to
pronounce that but it's just gorgeous
and I know it's expensive but I have to
mention it because I just love it that
much last but not least we have a
contouring powder by Mac and this is a
sculpting powder in the shade shade stir
so we were saying in the shade shade
stir I originally got mine on Nordstrom
I buy like anything that's ever sold nor
should I buy it on norcombe comm because
they have free shipping and free returns
355 days a year and I'm kind of obsessed
with that um but I just got on nortre a
couple days ago and they don't have this
anymore so it's now on MAC Cosmetics
calm I don't know anything about this
product I'm not up to date with mafic I
used to be so I don't know if this is a
limited edition product that came out
like specifically for a limited edition
collection I don't this is permanent I
have no idea where
today right now I've been wearing it
constantly for the past couple weeks it
is one of my favorite contour shades
I've ever use I'll show you the Kat Von
D shade light palette this one right
here I use this one a lot when I'm
contouring and then this is the map
shape stir so the Mac shape stir is a
little less gray it has a little bit
more dark depth to it so and that is
what I love about it so much the Kat Von
D one these shades can be a little bit
too cool on me and if I'm not careful I
can quickly look actually and kind of
gray but this one doesn't do that to me
this one is just like the perfect shade
for my skin tone so if you guys like
through the same problem as me when it
comes to finding perfect contour colors
I would really try this one out again I
can only find on that cosmetics calm so
it might be in your Mac store you guys
can call your local Mac and seeing that
jazz but that's where I saw it
alright you guys so that is it for my
monthly favorites I really hope that you
guys do enjoy this video I love monthly
