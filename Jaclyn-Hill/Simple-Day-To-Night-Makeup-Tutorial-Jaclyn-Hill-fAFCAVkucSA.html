Muno climb is yeah I'm going to be doing
kind of my everyday makeup routine and
how I transition it into night time
appropriateness what the past couple of
weeks I've been really busy in the
morning and not had a lot of time to get
ready
well actually correction I haven't made
a lot of time to get ready because I
like to sleep so when I wake up in the
morning I have found a way of doing my
makeup that makes me feel like a little
bit better a little bit more alive I
look healthier I look glowing but yeah
it's not over the top it only takes 10
minutes super easy but I've gotten
really comfortable with this makeup look
and I really been enjoying it so and
then a lot of times I'll get busy eat
later in the day and so I'll transition
my makeup from that kind of morning
fresh glowy look to a more nighttime a
little bit smokier look and I'm saying
so I thought that'll get out here and
show you guys what it is I do to kind of
create that morning look and then
transition into a nighttime look this is
just me personally what I've been doing
I'm not saying in any way you should be
doing is exactly routine if you want a
full coverage foundation every single
day I support that and if you want to do
winged liner and lashes every single day
I support that too this is just what I
have been doing and what I've been
liking I'm going through the phase right
now where I'm really into the natural
lashes I'm into this lower lash line
really smoked out it's just my thing and
there was a minute there where I was
wearing false lashes all the time
because my right eye these lashes were
just messed up like there was something
going on they were at all different
directions some of them are falling out
it was just a hot mess so now I have
been embracing my natural lashes again
the past couple of weeks because of that
so I'm gonna stop talking I love you
guys thank you for watching this video
and I'll see you soon
so today we are going to be starting
with the face and the first thing I'm
going to be doing is just moisturizing
my lips I'm using the chorus
lip butter that I mentioned in my most
recent February favorites video now I'm
going to prime my face and I'm going to
be using these Smashbox photo finish
primer water I absolutely love this
stuff I am dry skin so I love this
because I feel like it really hydrates
my skin makes my foundation last longer
and look better because it's not
settling into lines or cleaning to dry
patches yes I'm going to be using the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
I'm currently using a
5.75 you can use whatever you prefer on
a day-to-day basis that this is my
favorite foundation ever I just love the
way it lays on my skin it applies
smoothly and it gives a very nice dewy a
very fresh looking face so I'm going to
go ahead pump that on the back of my
hand and then I'm going to use a sigma
f80 flat top kabuki brush to apply this
I'm actually going to spray my
foundation brush with a little bit of
fix+ from Mac this finishing mist this
finishing this has blisterin in it and
so that's going to kind of help I like
it i adhesive like a glue to the skin
it's also going to share out the
foundation a tiny bit and just make it
look very natural and glowy on the skin
so I'm just taking that foundation off
the back of my hand and I'm going to
apply it to the skin I am NOT going to
put on a thick layer of this foundation
I'm going to go more lightly since we
are doing an everyday look I'll
continuously spray that brushes at one
time as I'm applying the foundation and
as you can see my face is much lighter
than my neck that's because I use
sunless tanner and if you guys are
wondering what my favorites almost
tanner is it's loving tan I talked about
a few months ago it's still my favorite
but anyways because I use that my face
is a lot lighter than my body because I
don't always tan my face and I exfoliate
my face all the time so because of that
I have to take my foundation a few
shades darker than my face in order to
match up my neck in my body so because I
do not have bad dark circles today I'm
going to do the craziest thing in the
world and I'm not going to be using
concealer Oh what I know I'm actually
just going to take a little bit of that
foundation and just run that slightly on
the under eye area I'm not going in with
like a fresh compound ation I'm using
whatever is left on this brush so I'm
barely putting anything on this area
this is honestly just a big time-saver
not using concealer but if you feel like
you have to have concealer of course you
do you that's not going to take away
from that natural esque look I just feel
like I don't personally need it day
today you know I'm saying I would really
really recommend these Mac prep and
prime highlighting sticks they come in
three different shades they come in a
yellow a rose and a peach so all
different skin tones can kind of conceal
and correct and right into the same
and with these I absolutely love love
love these concealers concealer six
highlight I think there's actually
beautiful and are quick easy way to get
the job done okay so now I'm going to
take a little bit of this Becca
under-eye brightening corrector huh I
love this stuff this is like my new
obsession I just are using about two
weeks ago it has a really really
beautiful brightening effect to it but
yet it's not shimmery it's not sparkly I
just have this gorgeous glow which I
love so I'm going to be taking it on
just my ring finger and tapping that
underneath my eye area and you will be
able to see the difference immediately
of what this does it has a nice kind of
soft pink pearl essence to it so it
gives a beautiful glow to the skin now
I'm going to be going in with the soleil
ten Deschanel cream bronzer so my
favorite part of my gonna love this
product so much I've talked about it so
much recently I'm going to be using the
Sigma angled kabuki brush this is the
f-84 this is my favorite brush ever to
apply at this cream bronzer so I'm just
going to take that brush in there get a
generous amount but then I'm going to
tap some of it off on the back of my
hand so that it doesn't go on to patchy
or anything I'm just going to take that
brush and I'm just going to bronze the
cheek area when I'm applying this
bronzer I constantly tap the product
into the skin
I don't drag I'm just pressing and as
you can see I'm bringing this a browser
up on like a higher point of my
cheekbone because I'm not actually
contouring I sculpting the face I'm
bringing like a little bit of a
sunkissed glow to the skin if you will
so I'm going to bring this up kind of
all over the cheek area as opposed to
just a sculpting face I'm going to add
some warmth in here so you take a little
bit of that and just put it on the base
of the chin continues your my voice
crack a language in so now for blush I'm
going to be using this benefit of a
major red I think it's called a mock
white shirts in the back then it's a
cream to powder blush which is
definitely true teasing you for supply
it applies totally like a cream but then
once it's on the skin it blends out and
looks like a powder I'm going to be
using a Mac 130 brush which is just a
205 or Cottage
step brush you can use whatever you want
this is just what's sitting in front of
me now with this product as opposed to
the bronzer where I was pressing this
one I'm actually rubbing I'm not
pressing this one I'm kind of rubbing it
very light handedly in circular motions
now I'm going to fill in my brows and
since I'm doing a day-to-day look I'm
going to fill them in very um where's
the term lightly Wow get it together
so now I'm going to go and with makeup
geek Peach Smoothie eye shadow I love
anything with a little bit of like a
peachy undertone because it'll just make
everything look a little bit fresher and
on Andy 40 brush all I'm going to do is
just lightly dust that back and forth
and when she wiper motions and that's it
this is just going to give the eye a
little bit of definition but no one is
actually going to be like oh pretty eye
shadow you know what I'm saying it's
just gonna make your eyes a little bit
more defined a crease now it's gonna
curl my lashes and I'm just going to
kind of pulsate on them for a few
seconds okay so now for mascara I'm
going to be using the Tarte lights
camera lashes mascara oh my gosh this is
my baby and the top is missing because
Georgie got ahold of it and shoot it
right off but whatever I'm just going to
work in zigzag motions kind of teasing
my lashes going up I'm taking this
Revlon lip gloss in the shade super
natural and this is a very natural shade
it's got a little bit of a pink in it
but for the most part pretty much is
going to look like your lips which is a
little bit glossy err okay so now we
have our daytime look complete I hope
the camera picks it up what I see is
sometimes I'm editing these videos I'll
be like why doesn't it look the same so
I really hope that this new lens isn't
picking up the way it looks in person
because in person it just looks so fresh
very natural very kind of youthful and
dewy so I love this look I've been
wearing a constant in the past couple of
weeks I feel so comfortable in it I feel
like I look just like myself but just
everything is a little bit more enhanced
and just a little bit better it's a
little bit better version of me not
gonna lie so now I'm going to show you
how to take this simple daytime look and
transition it into more of a smoky and
nighttime look so let's jump into that
okay so we are back it has been about an
hour since you last saw me I let my
makeup sit for a little bit and when I
got some water I
Oh side shots for my intro so now we are
going to get back into this let me just
make my hair real nice and tight the
first thing I recommend when
transitioning your daytime look to a
nighttime look is using a damp Beauty
Blender first thing the reason being is
because when you do your daytime look
you're obviously not going to transition
it to a nighttime look for hours later
or maybe like almost the entire day by
that point your makeup will baby be
moving maybe it'll be settling into some
little like fine
smile lines or some lines between your
eyebrows which I've always get because
hello I make a lot of facial expressions
so I always take a damp Beauty Blender
get it nice and wet bring out all the
excess water with a towel or paper towel
or anything like that then take that I
just kind of DAB it underneath the eye
area on the chin the smile lines in
between the eyebrows this will just pick
up any excess product or if you have dry
skin and it's been like clinging on to
patches this Beauty Blender will just
make everything look nice and fresh
again so now I'm going to be setting my
under eye area with some powder and you
might be thinking why didn't you do that
for your daytime routine and the reason
why is because I just wanted to have
that kind of light fresh dewy look
underneath my eye and I don't use
concealer underneath my eyes so I wasn't
going to have anything creasing but
because I'm about to go in with some
darker shade on my lower lash line I
don't want them running or moving down
so I'm going to apply powder underneath
my eye area first and that way it'll
keep everything in place taking that
same highlight shape I'm going to put a
little bit right here on the chin a
little bit on the Cupid's bow now I'm
going to go in with the eye shadow
saddle and this is by Mac this is one of
my favorite eye shadows up all-time I
have been using it for years I'm going
in with a sigma e25 blending brush and
I'm just going to put that in the crease
area and go back and forth pretty much
the same thing that we did earlier with
Peach Smoothie but now darkening things
up a little bit you ain't got no life oh
my gosh this morning to get out of my
head right now now I'm gonna take a
little bit more of that peach smoothie
on the e-40 brush and just blend that
out now I'm going to go in with a black
eyeliner and I'm going to be using one
by ardency Inn and this is the monster
eyeliner in the shade black talked about
this so many times it is the best
eyeliner ever especially for your
waterline it is so smooth and so
creamy and doesn't irritate my eyes I
love this stuff I got mine on Sephora
calm so now I have eyeliner all over my
top and my bottom waterline and you
could say like this in move on it's
going to make your eyes look much more
squinty and smaller so I like to go in
and smoke out my lower lash line because
I think that it brings more like a kind
of sexy smoky look to the eyes as
opposed to this can just kind of close
your eyes a little bit make them look
kind of squinty some people can really
pull this off I do not like the way it
looks on me so I'm going to go in and
smoke out my lower lashline I'm going to
take a sigma e15 this is a flat shader
brush and I'm going to pick up this dark
brown right here and this is maca and
bark it's just super dark I don't want
to go in with a black 20x I don't want
it to be that dramatic so taking this
dark brown I'm just going to push this
right on that lower lash line and I'm
just an to move back and forth okay so I
want you to see how messy this lower
lash line looks right now I'm just very
harsh just going to show you like the
steps in the process of what we're going
to do so next we're going to grab a
pencil brush we're going to blend that
out but you can see right now it's super
Java T it is not flattering at all but
we will change that by the next step so
now I'm going to go back in and grab a
Mac saddle again on a pencil brush and
I'm going to just take this and go
directly over that dark brown that we
just placed and I'm going to go all over
the outer corner to the inner form back
and forth I'm going to go in and curl my
lashes again just to get more volume
back in them I'm going to be using
Milani Luminoso blush and a morphe
g-eight to apply that just for a little
bit of a refresher on my blush and so
little bit below then for my favorite
part I'm going to highlight my cheeks
I'm going to use hourglass ambient
lighting powder and the shade luminous
light and I'm using a morphe and five oh
one brush I talked about this my
favorites this is look vivos brush over
her highlighting
and I'm just going to take that on the
tops of my cheekbones yeah take a little
bit on the chin take a little bit put on
Cupid's bow take a little bit on the
inner corner of the eye take a little
bit input on the brow bone this is all
over my face and you can use any color
of lipstick will match this you can use
a hot pink if you use a dark red you
could do whatever I'm going to do a pink
lip I'm going to use my lipstick by
Gerard why did I just check the bottom I
look like what's the name of this you
know I named it this is buttercup of
sick then I'm going to go over that with
butter cream lip gloss and done Oh

whole time when I was putting my head so
