my first New Year's Eve makeup tutorial
this was so spontaneous it is Saturday
night right now and I was not planning
on filming until Tuesday morning because
I'm busy with my family tomorrow on
Sunday and then Monday I have meetings
and appointments all day so I'm not
going to be able to film on Monday so I
thought I wouldn't be able to film until
Tuesday morning but then I was singing
from the mirror just now just playing
with makeup like I always do before I
wash my face at night and I was like I'm
feeling inspired so I just sat down and
turn on the camera and decided to film
this video before I wash my face and go
to sleep for the night so yeah I hope
that you guys enjoy this super
spontaneous makeup look but I thought to
myself the next makeup look that I'm
gonna be doing is much more dramatic it
has a pop of color and of course
incorporates glitter but I wanted to do
something that is more for those of you
who like the minimal makeup look because
this is a very minimal day-to-day makeup
look with just an extra pop for New
Year's Eve so a pop of color on the lips
and then some glitter liner is really
the only extra steps in this look
everything else is very minimal and very
day today so I hope you guys enjoy this
video thank you so much for watching I
love you guys and I'll see you soon
bye hello so today I am going to be
starting with my face and I'm going to
be priming my skin using benefits day
flawless 15 hour primer I haven't
mentioned this quite a few times mainly
in the past about like a year ago when
it first came out I'm not the biggest
fan of primers but I do like this one I
think that it makes the foundation stay
put and not crease it definitely does
kind of feel like glue on the skin
though just all morning I'm gonna be
going in and doing my foundation with
this foundation from I believe it's
called Co Gendo Co Gendo I will put the
name down below instead of butchering it
for you guys thank you very much
then I'm gonna be spraying mac fix+ on
my foundation brush i'm using the morphe
g6 brush for foundation i spray this on
my brush just because it gives a little
bit more slip-and-slide to the
foundation and it will also share out a
little bit and help my skin look very
dewy and moisturized so I am using the
shade number one two three and the same
Basheer coverage foundation and as you
can see i'm gonna put on a very sheer
layer i do not want my skin to be like
packed with coverage today because i
really want this to be a natural kind of
minimal make-up look with just a little
extra oomph for New Year's if you know
what I'm saying so putting a light
coverage of that foundation all over the
face and you can see how it looks on my
skin we can still completely see-through
it to our natural skin then I'm gonna go
in with NARS radiant creamy concealer
and I'm going to put this on the entire
under eye area but I'm not going to be
putting a generous amount on my eyelids
if you guys have very pigmented eyelids
and you really want to conceal and cover
that up you by all means do so but just
because I wanted to keep this very
minimal and easy I didn't want to pack a
ton of concealer all over the eyelids so
I will just very lightly blend whatever
is left over on that eyelid area but I'm
not gonna put a huge generous amount I
am as always blending my concealer from
the inner corner of my eye and AV motion
and then up towards the temples of my
face just to kind of give a slight
lifted appearance then I'm going to set
the under-eye area just using a little
bit of the anastasia beverly hills
banana powder which is found in her
contour kit or sold individually on her
website i believe just setting that so
that nothing creases or moves because my
under-eye concealer will crease if i
don't set it oh right in the face i'm
going to then take a Nastasia contour
color in the shade camel i have her
contour book that she sent out to tons
of people but this is also sold
individually not in the huge gigantic
book so I am using camel to go in and
sculpt out my cheekbones I am using a
makeup geek blush brush to do so it's
just a very small round dense brush it
is ideal for contouring it gets in every
little nook and cranny of your face
perfectly so I am going to make this
contour semi intense okay
it's pretty intense I'm not gonna lie
listen I went a little overboard but hey
you can't help me okay when I'm doing a
minimal makeup look sometimes I have to
go overboard on at least one thing just
give me something okay I'm just gonna
blend all of that out so that we have no
harsh lines because I was about to say
there's nothing worse in the world then
a harsh contour but then I was like wow
Jacqueline get it together first world
problems moving on I'm taking that exact
same camel shade from Anastasia Beverly
Hills and I'm
going to put it in my crease using a
sigma e40 which is just a big blending
fluffy brush I do this technique a lot
where I take a bronzer or a blush that
I'm using and I just put it on my eyes
as well just to kind of even everything
out and give a little definition to the
eyes then I'm gonna go in with Becca
blush in the shade Sweet Pea but this is
one of my favorite blushes recently and
then using a g8 brush by morphe to apply
this blush I'm gonna go on the apples of
the cheeks right above that contour up
towards the temples and kind of blend
this together with that contour shade
then I'm going to just lay right over
top of that the hourglass ambient
lighting powder and luminous lights I am
using a morphe eye shadow blending brush
to do this because I don't want it to be
like overboard but I do want to have a
little bit of a glisten and a glow on
the cheeks of course we were talking New
Year's Eve people like just dumped my
entire body and glitter to even that out
I'm going to put a little bit of it on
my chin and I also tap the tiny bit of
it on my Cupid's bow as well then I'm
gonna go in and curl my lashes I'm using
in Lancome lash curler that used to be
my mom's and I swear this thing is held
up for like 25 years but any lash curler
will do I'm going to go in with Tarte
lights camera lashes mascara which is my
current favorite mascara it is so great
at volumizing and lengthening I just
absolutely love it if I'm going natural
lashes and not using falsies I'm going
to definitely be using this mascara for
sure it's my favorite at the moment so I
am putting on two coats of that mascara
and then I will also make sure that I
put mascara on the lower lashes as well
my favorite lower lash mascara is Rimmel
lash accelerator and then this one that
I'm using right here is mac gigablack
lash I just love this tiny tiny little
brush it makes it so that you can get
every single lash very precisely then
I'm going to fill in my brows and today
I am filling in my brows much
differently than normal I was about to
be like I don't know if you guys noticed
in the intro but like seriously I'm sure
you guys didn't notice my brows in the
intro but I'm filling them in
differently and I am loving this I think
they look much more natural this way I'm
kind of leaving the inner corner of them
a little bit more blank so they don't
look as harsh and I'm just not going as
hard and as intense as I was before and
as you can see I think they just look so
much more natural this way now I'm going
to be taking a lick
cosmetics glitter glue and glitter so
this is the glitter glue that you can
see right here they have a small little
travel-size and then a bigger size that
I am holding I'm going to be using the
brush that they sell on their website
and today I am using the glitter in the
shade Marilyn Monroe which is the most
perfect silver platinum glitter ever
when I saw this glitter I was like shut
up it is absolutely perfect so using
that brush that comes in like on their
website I'm going to just be lining my
upper lash line I'm not going to be
doing a wing I'm not gonna be doing a
flick and nothing fancy you can make
this as thin as you want or as thick as
you want but I'm literally just going to
drag this right along that upper lash
line and that is it there is nothing
like overboard or not--not trickiness to
this you know arms say like it's just
such a foolproof easy awesome look so
then I'm going to just coat my lashes
with one more coat of mascara because we
do not want any glitter stuck in our
lashes because that is not a cute look
so one more coat to kind of wipe away
any loose glitter that may have fallen
in our lashes so that it doesn't look
messy as you can see that was the
easiest thing ever right it's like
foolproof I absolutely love it now i am
taking a sigma lip base in the shade
rhapsody and i'm going to be lining my
lips and then completely filling them in
isn't this such a pretty color it's like
such a wine cranberry kind of burgundy
shade i think it's so pretty but then
i'm going to top it off with Lime Crime
Velveteen in a shade utopia I don't
think I've ever used this shade before
on my youtube channel and I just love it
and I have just raved about the Lime
Crime Velveteen 's recently they dried
to a completely matte shade they are so
pigmented and the only thing that gets
these babies off is olive oil trust me
alright so there we have our completed
look I hope you guys enjoy this super
quick New Year's Eve makeup tutorial
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
