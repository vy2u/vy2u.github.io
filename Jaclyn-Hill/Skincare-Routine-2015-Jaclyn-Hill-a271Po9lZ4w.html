be filling my skincare routine for you
and I am so excited to be doing this
video like you have no idea because I
know that this is hands-down the most
requested video on my channel right now
so I'm looking very forward to getting
this out and putting it up I've
attempted to film this twice in the past
like month and both times it was a total
failure
so I am ready to finally get this done
and get it up for you guys I have been
using this skincare now for actually on
off for about four and a half years but
I came fully committed to the skincare
I'm going to talk about today about a
year ago and let me just say off the
back it has truly changed my skin like
my skin is not even close to being this
thing that it was even when I started
YouTube and I know that tons of you guys
have made comments telling you that you
notice that my skin keeps improving and
getting better and better and better and
it really is true if you go back to like
my first year on camera and you look at
those videos you will notice that my
skin looks completely different than
than it is now I mean I swear it's like
as I get older my skin is getting
younger and that's all because of these
skincare products for sure I always try
to make my skin the best it can be
because of the fact that hello your
makeup isn't going to look as good as it
can if you're not taking care of your
skin the best that you can you know I'm
saying so I finally found every single
product that my skin needs that works
for me and I am so happy with my
skincare routines funny enough it's very
ironic that I'm choosing this week to
fill my skincare routine when my skin
the past week has not been this bad in
months like my skin right now is
freaking out I have so much texture
right here and I have a blemish right
here I went to LA for seven days and my
skin hated it I don't know what happened
with like the last two days there my
skin starts flipping out it came back to
Tampa it's flipping out so it is what it
is but we will move past that I know
that it'll just last for a couple more
days and then we'll be good to go um so
anyway starting off I will say my skin
is dry to normal and actually funny
enough the last couple of months I've
been producing a little bit oil in my
t-zone which is crazy and I'm very
excited about it I never thought in a
million years that I would be oily
because I've been so alligator
my entire life but I'm now starting to
produce a little bit of oil at the end
of the day I'll be oh my god I'm a
little bit of oil on my chin like I'll
have it a little bit here on my nose and
I'm like so excited about it you guys
who are really order you're probably
like really you're excited about that
but I want my skin to have oil in it
because that will help preserve my skin
and keep it younger and youthful longer
I'm gonna jump into the products that I
have been using recently and tell you
guys about them I have some notes that
for each product so I can tell you like
what it is that they do and why they
work for me the skin can I'm gonna be
talking about is pharmaceutical grade
skincare and if you're thinking like oh
great I will ever be able to use my
hands on that if you are interested in
purchasing any of the products I'm going
to talk about today all of these
products I get through a family member
of mine her name is Diana fountain I've
mentioned her before and I know quite a
few of my subscribers have gone and seen
her and had phone consultations and she
is an amazing aesthetician I mean she's
been doing this for like 30 years I
think and she has like every certificate
and award you can think of she's
magnificent she teaches classes she's
incredible so we're very lucky to have
her in our family it is because of her
that I have the skin care routine she
has helped me improve my skin so so much
if you guys are interested in purchasing
any of these products if you're
interested in a consultation she said
that you guys can give her a call on the
phone and if you mention me and my video
who just name-dropped me that she will
give you guys a 10% discount and she
will ship to you whatever is that you
want if you're interested in these
products and know that is in no way in
affiliation and I'm not gonna earn a
penny off of that I know that people are
media they're going to be like gosh is
this sponsored no this is not sponsored
um she's just very sweet and because I'm
family she told me that she would love
to do this for my subscribers so if you
guys are interested in this I'm going to
put her information down below with her
cell phone number you can call her or
you can text her she communicates
greatly through both if you wanted a
phone consultation she would be happy to
do it for you if you want to get the 10%
off you want to get a product shipped to
you whatever may be call her she will be
your go-to gal for this shoot absolutely
in credible and so I just want to put
that out there for you guys if you're
interested in any of these products I
would very much discourage you from
getting online finding me some
I am and purchasing them for yourself
and then not ending up working because
they are pharmaceutical grade I really
highly recommend you talking to a
professional about them and describing
your skin and even if you could go see
her if you're in the area and actually
get a facial oh my god it'll be like the
best experience of your life she's so
amazing okay so first thing we're going
to do is talk about cleansers and then
we're going to go in each step of how
exactly I do my skincare routine I'm
going to be showing you my nighttime
routine but also going to be mentioning
everything that I use in the morning as
well so first thing is first this is
super embarrassing but this is my purity
paste Aquash because I took the big
bottle it was so low and I squirt it
into this one when I was traveling to LA
and then me and Jackie use it the whole
time we're there so there's like none
left and my new bottle should be showing
up tomorrow so just don't mind this and
yes the cap is gone so this is the
purity one set facial cleanser this has
been my ride-or-die cleanser for the
last three years at least maybe four
years I'm not sure exactly and I have
the best perception of time but that's
okay this is the best cleanser I've ever
used I probably tried 50 different
cleansers and I always go back to this
one it removes all my makeup it's so
gentle I have very sensitive skin and
it's so gentle on my skin
it doesn't burn my eyes it just takes
everything off in one quick motion it's
just so easy it doesn't dry me out it
doesn't break me out so I feel like this
is going to be my baby until the day I
die is the purity one-step facial
cleanser so the next product that I go
in with right after I get done watching
my skin is the Sanitas brightening peel
pads and I know I mentioned these in a
favorites video quite a few months ago
and you guys I can't even begin to tell
you how much I love these pads and how
much they have truly changed the texture
of my skin I've always struggled a
texture right here like on the cheek
area just little tiny bumps underneath
the surface of my skin the brightening
peel pad made a difference in my texture
within three days so I use these every
single night you can use the morning and
night but I'm super sensitive so I don't
irritate my skin so that's the reason I
only use them at nighttime and the
description of these says it has three
different acids in them to help
resurface your skin diminish appearance
of fine lines and wrinkles lighten dark
spots and minimize appearance of large
pores I'm right or dive these babies so
after I go in with the brightening
he'll pass I'm going to use two products
that are both by the brand bio to
cosmeceuticals and the reason that I
purchased these in the first place is
because Diana told me that she's been
using them for ten years and she can't
live without them Saul's like okay throw
in the bag let's see if they work and
it's now 13 months later and I can't
live without them I am now addicted just
like she is and the first one is
actually medical grade oxygen it looks
the same as like those Evian water like
spray miss things you can find it like
Ulta but this is medical grade oxygen
with a patented amino Plex says right
here that the patented amino Plex
contains over a hundred ingredients to
help heal and feed the skin it also
helps to soften fine lines wrinkles and
brighten so next we have the blue gel I
like to call the blue gel that's with me
and Miss Diana call it but it's kept
really called the amino some moisture
gel and it just goes hand and hand with
this one because they both have the
Pakatan amino Plex in it which has over
a hundred different ingredients to help
everything with your skin and this one
actually has hyaluronic acid in it as
well it says it helps bind water to the
skin feed the skin and it helps plump
the skin so you're going to get a lot of
moisturization with these things and
they can be used for all skin types so
next step is I will go in with my serums
and I use a different serum in the
morning and then I use a different serum
at night so I'm going to start off with
my morning serum I think that this is
one of the best products that Sanitas
sells I have gotten so many of my
friends and family on this serum and you
can use this morning and night I only
use a different Sam for night because I
tried them and I love them so much so
now I use a nighttime serum along with
the daytime but this one is incredible
and I notice such a dramatic change in
my skin after using this for a couple of
weeks and this is the peptide and tight
aging serum so this contains 40% of high
concentrated biogenic peptides which is
in saying to get 40% peptides which
means your skin is going to be able to
soak up a lot of peptides and peptides
are going to help with anti aging and
your fine lines and wrinkles and it says
here in the description that the
peptides are going to help relax wrinkle
formation improve lymphatic circulation
reduce inflammation while stimulating
fibroblasts at production of collagen
and resource skin's natural elasticity
holy moly can you keep up with that
description
I don't think I can even keep up with
that description but basically long
story short it's just going to help your
skin is going to improve its going to
anti-age and it's a bomb and it freakin
works so now for my nighttime serums I
have two different serums I go back and
forth I have the vitae rich serum and I
have the vitae C serum so they're both
jam packed with vitamins and on Monday
I'll use the bio rich Tuesday vitae C
Wednesday vitae rich Thursday vitae see
like I literally go back and forth every
night it some nights I'll mix them both
in my hand and make a little vitamin
cocktail and use them both together they
both come out as an oil into my hand and
yes I look like a greased chicken after
I apply them but that's why I love it
because at night time I'll my face up so
I feel like it really does balance out
my skin I feel like once I introduce
these serums into my nightly routine
that is when I started to produce more
oil that does not mean that it's going
to make you produce more oil it just
means that it was helping balance out my
skin because I was too dry I'm now more
normal but a couple years ago I was way
too dry and it wasn't good like Diana
would look at my skin under the
microscope and be like oh honey we have
got to get some more oil on your skin
like it was really Aging in causing fine
lines and wrinkles at such a young age
because my skin was like alligator skin
so these two serums I feel like are
really the things I mean I have to give
credit to everything the entire routine
but I feel like once I introduce these
serums it was within a month or two I've
started to notice a little bit more oil
coming to my skin because they're really
helping balance me out with all the
vitamins so the fighter rich serum says
it's 100% active preservative free
moisturizing serum it nourishes
anti-ages protects against photo damage
support cell growth improves texture
firms stimulates collagen reduces
redness and irritation so this is going
to be great for sensitive skin it's
going to give you relief it's going to
help calm down any inflammation any
redness and it's going to moisturize and
protect absolutely amazing I love these
terms so much they're like one of my
favorite things to apply by skin because
they just feel so rich and luxurious -
complying butter now for the vitamin C
serum obviously it's gonna be jam-packed
vitamin C because it's called vitamin C
zero so this one says that it has 25
sent a vitamin C which is crazy high 25%
that's amazing and then it said that it
protects from photoaging
neutralizes free radicals stimulates
collagen improve skin texture lightens
and brightens hyperpigmentation
moisturizes and promotes healthy skin
growth so just think a vitamin C and how
every single doctor tells you to get
vitamin C in your diet because it's
going to help to prevent and protect
your body from getting sick and getting
this and that now it's such an important
vitamin this is basically that for the
skin to put it in simple terms that's
how it makes sense in my mind so now it
is time to moisturize and just like my
serums I have a daytime moisturizer and
I have a nighttime moisturizer and at
first I only had this one moisturizer
that I use day and night but I told
Diana like I feel like I need more
moisture my skin is still so dry so she
was like okay let me give you a thick
nighttime moisturizer and oh my god this
night time moisturizer is so amazing you
guys if you're dry look no further this
Vidor rich nighttime moisturizer is so
amazing I can't even tell you it is so
rich and creamy it's like a body butter
for your face it doesn't break you out
like it is so good but I'm going to
start off with the oil-free moisturizer
this one is light it's oil-free and
nourishes it heals protects skin with
antioxidants improves your texture firms
and smooth skin and it's for all skin
types so basically it's your everyday
great go-to moisturizer it's one of
those moisturizers that you apply and
within three minutes you can and feel it
on your skin it just soaks in and poof
it's gone I will say though the bio rich
moisturizer is my favorite I use this
seven days a week every single night of
my life but I will also use this during
the day kind of feeling dry like in the
winter this is my daytime moisturizer
when I'll set in LA my skin felt so dry
that I use this every single day and my
when I was in LA because I just needed
like that extra richness in my skin so
as you can tell by the name of it Weiser
rich moisturizer
it's jam-packed with vitamins and it
says here the vitam vitamin oyster Iser
softens and firms and shield your skin
from agressive external influences it's
highly concentrated with 100% blend of
active vitamins of a C D and K so it is
jam-packed with vitamins it is richest
can be when you apply it to your skin 30
minutes later you will still be able to
like see the glow of it lick on your
skin
I can person see the globe on my skin
all day long I can feel it on my skin
all day long but not in an annoying
sticky greasy way but it almost feels
like it feels like it's shielding my
skin and it's just if you're dry you
will love this if you're oily not so
much just being honest but if you're dry
oh my gosh it's amazing
okay so last but not least this has got
to be the number one staple of
everything I'm talking about right now
because this product everybody in my
life is in love with no matter what
their skin type is and this is the
peptide eye treatment oh my god this is
the best eye cream I've ever used in my
entire life and I use this morning and
night it's light enough so that I can
apply it on my eye area and then go do
my makeup twenty minutes later and it's
not going to crease it's not going to
make my concealer like settle and get
all nasty I also apply this around my
lip area because Diana taught me to do
that and if you use a generous amount of
this around your lip area your lips will
almost have like a slight tingly
plumping sensation and you'll see it'll
plump up like the outer area of your
lips because this will plump and it will
tighten and it will make an immediate
difference in your fine lines it is so
incredible it doesn't matter if you're
60 years old or you're 16 years old
this is such an amazing eye cream I
seriously feel like everyone in the
world should own this it makes
two difference it has such a high
concentrate a pharmaceutical grade
peptides it's just amazing are you guys
so that's what makes my skincare routine
I really hope that you enjoy since it
was so highly requested again if you're
