she said but seriously it's gigantic oh
my god she said that too
hi everybody so today I'm going to be
talking about skincare and my personal
skincare routine and what works for me
and hopefully you guys would get some
tips and tricks along the way this is a
very requested video I'm doing it
because of all the requests I have
gotten for it and I understand the
requests please I love watching people
skincare routine I love hearing about
what works for them and what kind of
skin they have and I just love it and it
gives you some tips and products to look
at for yourself so yeah I'm happy about
making this video for you guys so first
off I will start off by saying I will
describe my skin - so you know what we
are working with here I used to be
extremely dry but um I was a smoker at
the time so I was very very dry then I
quit smoking and all of a sudden I
started developing oil around my nose
area um yeah I got a lot of air a lot of
oil in this area but then I was still
dry on my actual nose it was very weird
like I'd be flaking on my nose but oily
on my cheeks and I developed these tiny
little bumps on my cheeks and they had
no purpose they were not blackheads they
were not whiteheads they were not
pimples they're the exact sense colors
colors my skin
they were just texture they were just
bumps and I was like what are you doing
and I went to a facialist and talked to
her about it and talked to my sister
about it was Nessa Titian and I was like
asking everybody please help me and
everyone's like those things are nothing
they serve no purpose they're just
texture and it's like great so that is
the story of my skin so at this point I
am still combination ish more dry than
anything though like if I get out of the
shower and I wash my face and I don't
Pro moisturize within 5 minutes my skin
is like types like I can feel tightness
in these areas so it's dry um so yeah I
notice you know a little bit
skin type you can see the things I use
to fix those issues okay so first and
foremost I'm going to start with the
things that I use are not actually
skincare there are things from my home
in my kitchen I use on my face and put
my body to make myself healthier to make
my skin look better you might think I'm
afraid but that's fine you can leave
some comments below telling me how weird
I am totally acceptable okay first thing
if you watch candy Johnson which by the
way candy Johnson is my personal
favorite makeup artist I think that she
is so talented and so beautiful and such
a lovely person
and she's very inspirational so if you
watched her you may have seen some of
her old videos where she mentions this
and I use it as well it is the Norwegian
cod liver oil I know I know but it
tastes like straight-up lemon the only
thing that's weird about it is that it
is oil so it's like drinking olive oil
it's like the texture is kind of hard to
swallow but it's by Carlson and there
are so many beauty benefits in this but
if you look up online they'll tell you
more about it if I can't go into really
in-depth with every single product
because I'll be here for an hour but yes
it's amazing it makes your skin glow it
makes you so DUII truly I mean it's not
all those processes it's gonna do it it
does I mean I use it for a while people
were complimenting me all the time about
how glowing my skin was and I was like
oh thanks and then I stopped I didn't
use it for about a year and I went to
unbox them again I've had it for like a
month and a half now and you can see how
words I take a shot every morning or
night Norman on the mornings it's kind
of gross to it we start drinking oil
like I'm in oil holic I just started
using it again and I had to make fun of
the day and some friends were over and
they were telling me how how dewy and
glowy my skin was with no makeup on and
I was like has got to be that cod liver
oil so yeah it's it's awesome and you
can tell a big difference okay next
thing my exfoliator you're gonna think
of
that's okay I use organic cane sugar to
exploit my skin it's fine you can go
ahead and judge me but I'm the one
paying four dollars for my Slater that
lasts me a year and you're paying like
thirty for your crap I'm kidding
nothing in the world exfoliates my skin
like sugar does I have used many many
exposures and this one's the best since
I am dry and a little bit oily but not
really and combination and whatever I'm
very sensitive this is my best friend
I've tried so many different sugars and
all different brands and this is my
favorite one
right here I get mine at the public
screen wise I'm sure you can get it
anywhere though but it's my favorite
it's like very small beauty crystals and
I like chunky and they don't hurt they
don't leave my skin red but they do get
away all the dead skin and I do it's
about three or four times a week
depending what kind of week I'm having
depending on time of year I use it to
scrub my body sometimes and it works
amazing plus sugar is really good for
your skin and go look it up who is
texting me so next my last thing that I
use from my kitchen is honey I do not
use this specific honey this is the
honey that I use in my tea um but I do
use all natural pure honey on my face
and I use it when I have an incoming
pimple or is it or something I use it
and it dries out like nobody's business
you can put it on your like wherever
your problem area is and walk around
your house for like 20-30 minutes you
can leave it on for hours my mom when
she has an incoming pimple she sleeps
with it on like a little dot I feel like
I can't do it was it'd be all over my
pillow um but yes honey amazing for your
skin go look up the reasons why and it
works on to the skincare on days where I
am wearing makeup like today I first go
into bathroom and remove my makeup and I
use these you can I use like any
different talents that I can find that
we remove makeup but this is the ponds
evening soothe that
used to use the map ones I love them
some people don't like the smell I did
but now I don't pay for them because I'm
not getting them for nothing I'm not
going out tonight in 20 hours on
backwards on a normal daily basis I next
go in with the enzyme cleansing gel and
this is by Mario Badescu Mario Badescu
is the main of my skincare right now I
have been through hell and back with my
skincare routines and I was using a
skincare on routine at one time it was
working out great for me and then
stopped working out great for me and now
marva desk goo is coming to the rescue I
think so I'm pretty happy about him
right now normal daily basis I take off
my makeup with that and then I go on
with this the reason I use those wipes
first is because this does not get off
your makeup now to me I was like okay
this is weird if it's not cleaning off
my makeup then it can't be cleaning the
dirt on my pores like let's be serious
but it does because when I'm done using
this I can feel that my skin is clean
and then I'll go in with my toner and
which I will talk about next I'd go in
with my toner and there won't be
anything on that toner like on that pad
because it's getting off everything so
it's pretty impressive but first I'm
going to talk about this one this is the
glycolic foaming cleanser this is for
all skin types as the first one was -
now this one is more for combination
skin to oily skin so I can't use it all
the time I'm not even telling correcting
for you guys I'm sorry but this is a
great great cleanser this takes off
every speck of your makeup I mean it
breaks down everything it gets off your
eyelash glue you can go into the shower
the full face makeup and you will come
out with nothing um but this is awesome
but if it says you have dry skin to only
use it once or twice a week and if you
have oily skin to use it three or four
times a week so it's not supposed to be
here every morning and every night
cleanser which by the way I don't know
if I mentioned to you guys I do wash my
face every single morning and every
single eye I don't think I missed a
night without washing my face since I
was probably I would say 1415 years old
it's been you
years and years and years since I have
gone asleep without watching my face
even on the days where I did not wear a
second makeup I still watch my face
before I go to sleep because it's like
ooh my skin has seen the world today and
all the dirt that has to offer I'm not
putting out my pillow it grow it grosses
me out it's not whoa okay anyways
dramatic okay so then next after I wash
my face which whichever one I choose to
wash I then go in with my cleanser and
it's called the cucumber cleansing
lotion now I use this one because I am
once again on the drier side there is
another one called the special cleansing
lotion that one was amazing but I'm too
dry for it it didn't it like it dried me
out way too much it was yeah it was bad
but these toners I think are the best
part about Mario Badescu this toner is
what changed my skin it got rid of all
those bumps it controlled the oil and I
use this mainly only at night but if I'm
feeling like oh god these areas are
bothering me I go in with it in the
morning as well but this stuff is
incredible it's like it knocks out
everything that's even thinking about
happening okay so yes the toners are
incredible
so then during the day I will go in with
either one oh I'm not mentioning any of
the prices to you guys I'm sorry
umm I have them all listed in the
description bar below but both of these
the enzyme cleansing gel is $12 and the
glycolic foaming cleanser is $15 and the
prices on this but yeah they're all like
in-between like twelve and like twenty
dollars every single product so they're
not extremely expensive but they're not
super super cheap um okay so then these
are my face moisturizers for daytime
this one is the collagen moisturizer
with SPF 15 I use this on days where I
am feeling not super dry and when it's
really humid outside because this really
lets your skin breathe and when you put
on its conscious like there it's
immediately gone you don't feel
moisturizer on your skin at all which a
lot of people like I like to feel
moisturizer because I'm dry so also my
skin hates SPF every time I put this on
skin gets a little red and a little
blotchy for like 15 minutes and then
goes away so this is only my summertime
moisturizer but the hydrating
moisturizer with bio care and hydraulic
acid this is amazing this is thicker so
I use this I don't see at night time I
use a different moisturizer so that's
why these are strictly daytime but I use
this one when my skin is feeling more
dry I would say I use this four to five
days a week because even in the
summertime my skin is dry as can be and
I do not understand why but I am just a
dry person and I'm very very jealous of
you all a monster's out there even
though your life my makeup doesn't stay
on it's like no shut up you're gonna age
slower and you're gonna get wrinkles
later in life and no it's not fair i I
want more oil
I hate being how dry I am I mean I'm not
like crazy dry but I just I'm jealous of
you guys you can powder it's it's hard
to get rid of dry skin it's very hard so
then at night time I use josie maran
argan oil if you've not heard about this
it is so amazing it is 100% natural it
can not clog your pores and it can also
be used as an eye cream this little vial
was $15 I've had it for about I would
say two months if you can see it is
right there
click the cut off line so you can see
how far it's gone so I would say this
vial would last about three to four
months for $15 I don't think that's not
bad this has changed my life with my dry
skin this is so amazing I put it on at
night and my skin is just like and I
wake up in the morning and it's like I
have a new face I'm not even kidding I
have referred this to so many my friends
and family none have a bad thing to say
about it some of them are extremely oily
some of them are combination it's
amazing it won't call your pores and
it's not like oily oily it will like
your skin will soak it up it's awesome
and then this is a sample but I want to
go get the big one I'm not going to do
it summed off my sample but the Mario
Badescu samples are friggin awesome
they're huge but this is the herbal
hydrating serum and you can put this on
they say at night over top of your
normal moisturizer or you can use it
during the day for
light moisturizer but it's just filled
with minerals and herbs and it is
amazing I just put like a pea-sized and
it's enough for my entire face and it's
just like okay last Marva desta product
is this facial spray it's with aloe
herbs and rosewater um it's a lot like
fix+
or the mineral spray from Mac these guys
right here you can use it to set your
makeup you can also use it to refresh
dull looking skin all the ingredients in
it are amazing if you go to Nordstrom
which is where I buy all my skincare
products I am nor shown if something is
sold at Nordstrom I'm gonna buy it there
whether anywhere else because Nordstrom
is just my store I go there before I go
to alter Sephora or anything because I
love Nordstrom but yeah if you go there
they will give you a Mario Badescu
booklet it's like fifteen or twenty
pages it tells you everything you need
to know about the brand and all the
products and it helps you really figure
out what oh my god oh my god okay the
biggest squirrel I've ever seen in my
life just ran up on my window seal and
jump from one tree to another and it
literally has an entire piece of sliced
bread in its mouth the bread is as big
as the squirrel okay so that is my
skincare routine in general um more than
anything skin is the most important
thing to me more than makeup because if
my skin doesn't look good I don't even
want to put on my makeup and like do I
know that too a lot of people makeup is
to cover up the skin but to me it's like
my skin is gonna show through so I want
it to look good you can't hide your skin
as much as we all wish we could your
makeup is only gonna look as good as
your canvas so I just like to take
really good care of it and yeah um I
think I basically covered everything and
last but not least I get tons of
questions on my teeth Oh my pearly
whites no I'm just kidding I don't
really think I have that wide of teeth
and never notice them I live with them
but people tell me probably every single
day that my teeth are white and they
asked me about my teeth all the time
it's really funny actually like being
complimented on your mouth like
oh yeah no but seriously you just don't
understand my teeth when you have them I
guess but yeah people are always telling
you this oh right so I've got so many
questions from you guys about my teeth
and what I use to whiten them
I used to use crest whitening strips
years ago and then I use all the
toothpastes and Rembrandt in like the 3d
white strips and then I use some weird
things that like I bought online but
anyways moral the story is after
probably eight years of whitening my
teeth with different products I found
the best product in the world and oh I'm
kind of sad showing this to you guys
because it's like it's my product okay
but it's dr. George's dental white it is
so amazing okay so what I do with this
is I went out well actually I couldn't
find them in stores so I bought my own
Amazon nice guys some little mouth guard
things and they were like I think 99
cents for a mouth guard and I got myself
wondering my husband won so two dollars
for both of us and then we dip them in
boiling water and then I stick them in
my mouth and I just go and I like
Preston and I mold my own mouth tray and
it is that easy then I take this and I
just squirt it in the mouth tray and I
put it in there and when I first got it
I did it like three times a week for ten
minutes at a time and in one week just
three times I was like oh my god this is
a big difference so it is absolutely an
amazing and it's gigantic
and it is so cheap I got my bottle for
eight dollars so that price won't be
beat I hope that you liked this video I
hope that you picked up on some tips and
tricks and let me know if you guys use
any of these products and how you feel
about them or how you use them or let me
know any more at home remedies that you
have for your skin I know I have
millions I have so many like do it
yourself at home masks and moisturizers
and things that I use but I'm very
interested in all this so if you have
anything that you want to share with me
please do go ahead and leave comments
below letting me know what a freak I am
using sugar and honey on my face but I
don't care be my guests okay guys thank
you so much for watching and have a
great night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
