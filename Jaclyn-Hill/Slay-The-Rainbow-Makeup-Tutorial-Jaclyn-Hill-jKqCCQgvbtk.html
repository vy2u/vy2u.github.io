we're gonna be giving a mega tutorial on
this supernatural just very minimalistic
little products just minimal everything
everyday makeup look perfect for church
I actually went to church to be totally
honest but that just means new clothes
even Who I am you belong to make me not
sorry
okay Siri for those days video is
dedicated to all my unicorns out there
everyone who has left hundreds and
thousands of comments asking me to do
something fun and different and step
outside my box and really go outside my
comfort zone because normally I turned
my straddle the line of my comfort zone
today I blew half that covered the line
I go with the deep end like and it was
so much fun like I still have a salad
this makeup look makes me feel alive
like I had some good times releasing my
inner child today creating this look for
you guys
I was actually totally inspired by this
jacket edweird and that sound I
purchased this ensemble as you will like
oh we can have two weeks ago it actually
has like matching shorts down here hey
this outfit is Chanel which kind of like
I get so uncomfortable and you've no
idea I can't look in the camera my face
work out a lot mirror like I never
thought I'd see the day anyways I had to
have this like the second I thought oh
my god it's just so cool Bokke me on so
many levels I love the color I love the
texture I thought everything about it so
spunky is different and I love it so
when sharks to my house a couple of days
ago I put on a garment bag
so I hung on my door because that's just
something I do whether it's making
products clothing or handbags
accessories if there's something I've
really been wanting once I get it I like
put it on display somewhere where I can
see it every day I got what I want I am
sight anyways I had to pay me on the
door and like 20 times a day every time
I walked past it I wouldn't have to do
it makeup look like revolve it around
this I'm just so inspired by it so this
is what I came up with I hope you guys
enjoyed it it makes me think of Lisa
Frank so much but I would have died to
be able to wear this makeup and like
this color around a little girl like up
until the age of like 15 this would have
been my dream makeup look like you have
no idea so I don't know this is really
fun to kind of it connecting with my
inner child if you will and you guys do
like this colorful makeup look please
give this video a thumbs up I believed a
little button is a right below the video
is the right hand side hit that little
bump mark to let me know that you would
like to see more color incorporated here
on my channel and also please subscribe
and you haven't already unless you just
don't like like me or just want to hang
out with me but that's fine too
I am clearly so excited to be filming
today's video as if it wasn't obvious
enough already so I would just state it
one more time
my eyes are primed and good to go the
first thing we're going to do might seem
a little strange but we're going to pick
up some jeffree star liquid lipstick in
the shade Queen B I'm going to take a
synthetic brush and just go ahead and
pick up some of that lipstick and begin
to apply it on the inner corner of my
eye I didn't have a Paint Pot or a cream
color base for the eyes in the shade of
yellow so I thought we would improvise
and it worked beautifully
just going to look down and let that
drive like 20 seconds and then it'll be
set and good to go
next I'm going to pick up a makeup
forever eye shadow in the shade M - 7:20
which is like super perfect because
that's my birthday and I freaking love
this color I actually should have done
this first before the yellow but it
doesn't matter just do you slap that
bitch on and you'll be good to go I just
wanted to apply this in the crease area
because we are going to be going in with
a lot of shocking more intense colors
and this will help the blending process
as we move forward with everything else
now I'm going to pick up a Nastasia
waterproof cream color in the shade ice
blue this color is so beyond beautiful
it speaks to my soul I'm going
pat that on with a synthetic brush and
as you can see I'm literally patting it
not rubbing with the cream-colored I'm
going to lightly blend that into that
yellow and it's really cool because
it'll make kind of a green shade as we
mix them together and they'll just look
amazing later on then I'm going to grab
some mac cosmetics basic red this is an
old product I'm ashamed I even used it
but you know what it was creamy still
and it works so thank you for coming
through Mac in a time of need love you
and appreciate you I'm going to actually
create a wing with this which is so
intimidating at first even for me I was
like I'm going to do a wing with a cream
and then try to blend that out like it's
intimidating and it seems that you're
going to fail and mess it up but
honestly you can do it if you just use a
tiny bit product at a time and as you
can see me going over it over and over
and over to blending out you will get to
a blended point and then you'll be able
to go over top of it with shadow and
make it seamless I promise then we're
going to go in with a jeffree star
cosmetics androgyny palette we're going
to start off with using this fetish
color right here which is a really
beautiful red shade and I wanted to
initially go in with a deeper red like
this as opposed to a really bright
intense shocking red because I don't
like to use too many bright intense
shocking shades on the eye because it
won't I don't know in the end I'm not
going like the end result as much so
kind to mix more muted colors with
really bright colors so I'm picking up
the Urban Decay electric palette and I'm
going in with this gorgeous shimmery
purple shade in the shade urban I'm
going to just pack that on the whole
outer corner and originally laid down
all these cream bases first in case
you're curious is because it's going to
intensify the pigment in the shadows so
much more and because we're putting this
purple over top of that red it's going
to change and manipulate that purple a
little bit and just make it look
different than it would on its own then
we're going to pick up some charm which
is a gorgeous matte creamsicle shade
from the androgyny palette I'm going to
put that right over the edge of that
purple just to help blend out cuz I
wanted to go from yellow to blue to
purple to like pinky red to orange like
I want all the colors just to be like
flowing together as one you obviously
you can see my vision I'm going to grab
a makeup wipe just wipe underneath the
eye and just use my finger to clean up
and make it nice and sharp then I'm
going to go back into the electric
palette and I'm going to go in with I
don't even know what this shaded
actually called I can't read it from
here sorry but I'm going to grab a
little brush
begin to put that right over top of that
orange e red shade I initially went in
with just for more of a pop now I'm
going in with the purple shade again but
this time we're going to spray the brush
with six plus and we're going to go over
the exact same area to make it pop even
more you can do this with mattes and
shimmers anywhere on your eye if you wet
your brush with a little bit of fix+
it'll just really intensify the eye look
then we're going to go in with the
Aurora palette by anastasiya we're going
to pick up this Beauty full icy blue
shade and I did wet my brush with some
fix+ with this as well just so you know
because it did have a lot of fallout so
I did get a little spritz I'm just going
to pack it on right over top of that
blue just to give it that really
gorgeous metallic shimmer which I love
then picking up this color which is
called the rash it's like neon yellow e
green on 3rd I'm only going to put it
where that yellow meets the blue I'm not
going to take it all the way to the
inner corner because I love how that
yellow corner looks super yellow with
the jeffree star liquid lip but I wanted
to go from like bright yellow it's like
that neon green to blue now we're going
to go in with this gorgeous makeup
forever star powder don't even get me
started on this highlight look at this
we're gonna take a moment of silence
look at this highlight you guys we take
a minute I've owned this for like maybe
two months ever cited my Sephora haul
and you guys I think it's almost gone I
use it every day so I'm going to prime
my face and I'm going to go in with my
foundation I'm going to be using the
Dior forever foundation you guys oh my
god I'm have to go into depth about the
foundation in my favorites video coming
up but I cannot even begin to tell you
how much I love this foundation it is so
gorgeous
it makes my pores look like they don't
exist like when I wear this I cannot
believe how many people compliment my
skin and ask me what my skincare routine
is and I'm like it's not my skin it is
literally this foundation then of course
I'm going to be using some Tarte shaped
tape for my concealer under my eyes and
then a dance Beauty sponge well since we
did our eyes first and we created that
sharp line to make sure that you're
using a Beauty Blender that has a point
or a brush that has a point so you can
get right up and tight next to where
that shadow is but not actually damage
it or smudge it or ruin it now to set my
face I'm going to be using this
Charlotte Tilbury powder and a big ole
fluffy brush I get questions every time
I use this brush and it is by
then I'm going to move on to my lower
lashline and I'm going to start off by
going in with charm once again and a big
fluffy brush for underneath that lash
line to really buff and blend out and
make it super blended and intense I'm
going to use that color to connect the
lower lash line to all the products that
we applied on the upper lid then I'm
going to go in with a more precise brush
I'm going to apply that same purple from
the Urban Decay electric palette it is
really really buff that nice and good
all of that lower lash line and
connected to that purple that we have
going on so we applied earlier on the
upper lid I'm going to go back in with
basically every single color that we use
and put it right there along my lower
lash sorry off with the orange the
purple then blending out with that more
like intense shimmery kind of electric
coral if you will just so that
everything on the top blends really well
and matches with the bottom I want it to
look like a peacock when I'm looking off
to the side you know like from my side
profile
I want everything to line up now I'm
going to grab this absolutely gorgeous
matte blue that was just speaking to me
and I didn't know where to use it or how
to use it so I just picked it up on my
finger I just tapped it right in between
that beautiful blue and that purple just
for an additional pop and I loved it as
I get add something so special to the
look that I wasn't expecting but I love
the way it tied like the entire eye look
together
now going back in with that shade thrash
I'm going to put that on the inner
corner of my lower lash line and then
I'm going to just throw on some mascara
I'm using the l'oreal voluminous carbon
black mascara then for lashes i'm going
to be applying house of lashes in the
style boudoir don't worry everything
that I use every brush every product I
will a sit below in my description box
because I know I am moving quickly
through this for my lower lashes I'm
going to be using the Mac extended play
gigablack lash mascara because it's my
absolute favorite for lower lashes and
it has been for years I think it will be
my whole life and then to make this even
more intense and really stand out I'm
going to just put some fascinating eye
Kohl by Mac on my inner waterline to
really make it pop now for contour I'm
going to be using the Marc Jacobs Omega
bronzer which is technically a bronzer
but I'm going to be using it in the
technique of contouring today so using a
kind of precise brush I'm going to start
at the top of my ear area and I'm going
to bring it down towards the corner of
my mouth not bringing it all the way
though otherwise it will look a little
bit too dramatic stopping about same
percent of the way and then blending it
all over the hairline as well then once
we've done that I will go in and just
bake out this entire contour using the
perfecting setting powder by coverfx
this has been one of my favorite powders
like I came to be going to tell you guys
it is so beautiful it looks so natural
on the skin
I was so right or die for the RCM a no
color transition powder this one has
definitely taken its spot it's just so
natural and so not drying and I just
love just love the way it looks it looks
beautiful in pictures it looks beautiful
on the skin it just looks like skin and
it's just it's an amazing powder I can't
say enough good things about it now I'm
going to go ahead and just coat my brows
with some clear brow gel this is the
Anastasia of Beverly Hills a clear brow
gel just to lock those bad boys into
place then for the blush I'm going to be
using this color pop highlighting blush
duo I don't know the name of this you
guys I got these in PR and there's
literally nothing on the box like there
it doesn't say anything it's blank I'm
going to find it for you I'll find it
I'll link it down below now for the fun
part I'm going to go in with these
Sourav ski crystals I found at Michaels
they have them in a million different
colors I bought them and I think like 30
different colors honestly I'm going to
put a little bit of lash glue on the
back of these and just pop them in the
center of my eye and I used like a
greeny blue iridescent one that I saw
just matched this look so perfectly and
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to highlight the inner corner of my eye
using another starlet powder by Make Up
For Ever this is in the shade 0-2 it's
got a really intense kind of gold greeny
undertone in it and I thought that it
was absolute perfection with this look
so I'm going to put a generous amount of
that on the inner corner and I'm going
to put an even smaller one of these gems
and it's actually just like a plain
light lime green I'm going to put that
right over top of it it came in the same
exact packet is that your Destin twins I
have on the lower lash line I'm going to
pop it in there in a corner okay so now
for a highlight I wanted to do a really
fun just like holographic different
highlights so I'm going to be using to
make it forever star powders in a few
different shades and I started off with
the purple one then I'm going to go back
and with the same one I use on the inner
corner of my eye that has that green
undertone I'm going to put that more at
the top of my cheekbone what I want
basically is it's big green blue
purple so I'm going to go in with this
Kat Von D holographic palette and I'm
going to pick up that blue sapphire a
very generous amount of it and I'm going
to put it at like the highest point of
my cheekbone that way it goes from like
a greeny gold to blue to purple and the
cameras going to pick it up as much in
this lighting but in person it was
intense and I was obsessed for the lips
I'm going to be going in with jeffree
star cosmetics mannered a lot of jeffree
star cosmetics happen in this video this
is another one of his liquid lips in the
shade mannequin it's one of my favorite
news of all time but I knew I wanted to
do a liquid lip in this video and I
definitely want to do a nude one because
I didn't really know which route I was
going to take I'm going to show you two
different options here and I definitely
wanted to highlight that Cupid's bow of
course if that Cupid's bow popping I
want the whole face in the whole body to
be highlighted very intensely for this
and then I actually started off by doing
a silver metallic stripe down the center
of my lips to really make this like look
like a festival look and this is a Pat
McGrath silver eye shadow that I use and
I mix it with some mixing medium and
John was standing behind the camera
telling me that he loved it but I was
like I think I can make it better and
he's like it is super super cool and I
was like no I want to try something
different so instead I packed on some
mac cosmetics reflective teal glitter
and we both agreed that it made the look
way cooler like we just liked it you
could even do this with the silver
stripe if you wanted but I didn't want
to be too much and too extra so I just
stuck with this that complete this look
you guys honestly I hope that you enjoy
it so much I had such a great time
filming it for you I love you and I will
see my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
