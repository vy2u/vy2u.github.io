it like as big as your cheek that get
worse go away yeah mm-hmm that's right
that's the fat five yeah I'm watching
enews and I'm obsessed with watching it
because they're talking all about the
Olympics and every day I watch it I'm
just like
so enjoy the video that didn't work this
is a very sultry sexy cat I think that
it will look good on absolutely anybody
and I mean anybody this is gonna look on
anybody as pale as you are as dark as
you are line eyes brown eyes this is
going to look good on everybody it's
beautiful and it's so Universal beast
all matte shades there's no shimmer in
this whatsoever no sparkle so it's going
to look good on every single skin tone
it's just like it's just like a basic
going out smokey eye I mean for anything
but it has like a really sharp line on
the edge so it's going to give you an
edgy look to so it's not just like a
blah been-there-done-that smokey eye but
it's got like a little something to draw
the eye so I hope that you guys like
this let me know and I will see you soon
I
okay so the first thing I'm doing is
priming my eyes I am using select
cover-up which is just a regular
concealer and I'm using this because I
want to bring it down around the side of
my eye because I'm going to be putting
scotch tape yes
scotch tape on my eyes first I'm going
to put it on the back of my hand and
then I'm gonna peel it off so that the
main stickiness is gone so it's not too
harsh on that sensitive skin around my
eye area and I'm gonna line this up make
sure you get underneath your eyelashes
on the bottom and I'm gonna line this up
just like I did with my recent gel
eyeliner tutorial and you want to make
sure they're both even obviously I don't
know how I figure it out so quickly I
just pop them on but you just want to
follow that bottom lash line and up that
natural curve of your eye okay so now
I'm going in with vanilla this is a
matte eyeshadow by Mac and I'm just
going to use a big brush I'm just going
to Pat it on that inner corner yeah I'm
not really needing that much color in
there so it's just a light wash now I'm
taking typographic this is a dark gray
it almost looks black but it's not if
you can see it by the black that I
showed there it's just a really dark
grey so I'm going to take it on a pencil
brush and I'm going right along that
tape on my outer corner I'm gonna bring
this about half way to a quarter way
into my eyelid just rubbing back and
forth this tape method is really fun
because you get a perfect cat eye every
single time and you can be so messy
I mean you can be like as sloppy as you
want to be because this tape is going to
save you every time so now I'm going to
load up my brush with wedge and this is
a mid-tone Brown it's a really great
basic Brown from Mac and I am just going
to messily blend that up and into my eye
basically I just want to eliminate any
harsh lines with that gray that I put on
I don't want that gray to be super
defined I just want to get that smoky as
kind of a base for the black that I'm
going to go in with so as you can see
there's no like really method to this
I'm just blending it all over the place
by the way if you just saw a little head
walk by that was my niece not a ghost
okay didn't want to creep you guys out
anyways I'm blending this all over my
eyelid you can take it as far as you
want and then I'm going to take carbon
this is by Mac in any matte black will
work basically every eyeshadow palette
now has matte
blacks in it so I'm going to take that
and then follow the same steps that I
did with typographic and I'm also going
to take it and just put it up in my
crease if you don't have a defined
crease that's okay you can still do this
motion and it'll turn out and I'm just
taking it from the point and just
bringing it up then I'm taking this
brush which is it you can use it clean
or put more wedge on it it doesn't
matter mine is a little dirty because I
filmed this tutorial before and I
accidentally deleted it so I'm refilling
it so there's probably some wedge left
on it from before or whatever but just
take any blending brush and just blend
that black up and once again I'm not
doing anything super precise I'm not
trying to stay inside the box or any
lines just have fun with it and just
smoke it around because this is a super
smoky eye so you're able to have fun and
not be like really intense and precise
on everything so after I have that on
there I'm gonna go back in with more
carbon and put it right over that tape
again just to darken it up even more now
you don't have to do this you don't have
to use the carbon you can just use the
gray to make it more of a light smoky
eye but I personally don't like Gray's
in the outer corners alone I think they
need to be balanced out with some warm
Browns or blacks I just don't personally
like grace a lot of makeup artists I
know feel that way as well and it's just
a personal opinion
um but I'm just doing the same thing to
the other eye now and as you can see I
kind of swooped down under the crease
and then wing it up and I just blend
that through to kind of get that cat eye
so now I'm taking smolder and this is an
eye Kohl from Mac and I'm gonna dab it
on a brush any eyeliner brush or
smudging brush whatever you're
comfortable with you can use a q-tip I
mean it doesn't matter I'm going to take
it I'm going to smudge it right at my
lash line you can bring it up as high as
you want then I'm going to take my gel
liner that I always use and I'm going to
trace over top of it I'm sorry I'm not
in focus right now but the reason that I
did the eyeliner the smolder first is
because I want this gel liner not to
look really intense and harsh I want it
to have a little bit of a smoky area
effect so now I'm going to take red
cherries lashes and number 43 and these
have a wing on the end so it's really
going to emphasize that cat eye as you
can see right there I mean this look
definitely calls for false lashes it
really is going to help emphasize your
look so now I'm taking makeup Forever's
HD foundation and mac's mineralize i'm
using two in two different colors
because i got way too much sun this day
and i am so i am burnt if you can see my
chest in my neck I am so pink so I was
trying to find a color that wasn't like
really scary on me is the normal color
that I wear was way too light cuz I got
really a lot of color so I know that
this looks like really yellow and golden
on me and maybe kind of orange but that
is because I am so pink okay so I'm
doing a bold brow for this look because
I feel like bold eyes bold brows okay so
I'm using quark by Mac and the same
brush that I use every single time I'll
have all the information down below and
then I'm going in with select cover up
concealer in shade NW 25 and with my
concealer brush I'm going to start in my
inner corner and I'm going to work down
into a v-shape and I'm going to go up in
a little bit past that wing that I have
on my eye and then I'm going to take it
and I'm going to put it up really
tightly in my lashline as you can see
I'm showing you right here and I'm going
to use this as a primer for the
eyeshadow I'm gonna do under my eye you
can just put on some mascara and call it
a night I'm going to show you how to
make it even more dramatic and smokier
with the under eye shadow so next I'm
gonna take Ben Nyes banana powder and
this is really popular right now because
of Kim Kardashian's makeup artist he
says that he uses it on every single
client that he has sit down in his chair
and it's great because it's a yellow
undertone so it really helps to
highlight and brighten that under area
and I love it because I'm having a
reaction to the Mac's mineral powder so
this is my replacement and I'm really
really loving it
now I'm taking max give me Sun bronzer
and I'm going to use a small 109 contour
brush and I'm going to carve out the
hollows of my cheeks with this going
underneath the cheekbone and up on the
sides of my temples and right by my
hairline and you can see here what a
difference it makes with one side done
and one side not it really emphasizes
the cheekbones and this is something I
do almost every time I do a smoky eye
because it just really helps give you
that edgy carved structured look and I'm
to put up right by my hairline on my
forehead on both sides once again it's
just going to help slim down the face
and just give you more structure to the
look now I'm taking smolder again and
I'm putting it under my eyes now I know
this looks weird but I'm using that
brush I use to highlight to just push
lightly in on my eye and this will help
for me tugging that area down really
harshly
um now I'm going to take a small pencil
brush with wedge again and I'm just
gonna go back and forth once again
nothing too precise I'm just going back
and forth back and forth and I'm gonna
blend out that liner that I just put on
there it's gonna fall down naturally
because it's a coal and it's really
creamy so I'm going to take what's
falling down just move it around my eye
area now this light brown color and that
black is going to create kind of a grey
but that's okay because it's going to
help match the outer corner of the eye
and I'm just going to continue to just
go in and just buff it out I'm not
putting any additional products on my
brushes I'm just gonna move it around to
really smoke it out but because I'm not
in love with that gray look again I'm
gonna go in with embark and this is a
dark chocolate brown and it's more warm
I'm gonna take this and just dab it in
there and rub it around and this is
going to help warm that up so that it's
not such a cool tone smokey eye because
I don't want cool tone Gray's on my
under eye area I just don't think that
it's that flattering so this warm Brown
is going to help give it more of a
chocolate smokey eye which I think is
more flattering and I'm just taking any
brush I haven't used this before it's
clean and I'm just moving it around back
and forth just sliding it across my eye
and it's gonna help just smoke it out
okay now I'm going in with peaches blush
don't neglect your cheeks when you're
doing a smokey eye and contouring your
face because it's really easy to let the
apples of your cheeks just kind of fade
away and especially flash photography
you look really washed out now I'm
taking Mac's soft and gentle or just any
highlighter and on that same brush I'm
just going to brush up over top of my
cheekbones and the blush I just put on
once again is just going to help draw
attention to the face I love Mac soft
and gentle
I'm putting mascara on my lashes to help
bind the natural and fake ones together
and then I'm going to do my lower lashes
as well um again
if you don't have long lower lashes you
don't have to but mine look weird
because they're covered in eyeshadow so
this is a must for me I'm taking
Revlon's color burst lipstick and soft
nude and I am applying all over the lips
you know how to do it and I normally
don't wear really nude lips but I
figured this was necessary now just take
any nude lip gloss you have and just top
it off for a really shiny coat and you
are done and I hope you enjoy this
completed look and you have a great
night
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
