hey guys so today I wait no I have not
been here on YouTube for I think about
seven days but it's my get this video
uploaded just wanted to let you know if
you don't follow me on Twitter it's
because I have been sick on Friday night
I decided to get a sore throat and then
feel like crap for five days bad beauty
guru so I have not been filming videos
because of that and then finally
yesterday I went to the doctor just to
find out that I basically have an
infection from here up so I have now
been on antibiotic for 24 hours so don't
worry anymore but anyways I just wanted
to apologize for like my short absence
here because I ate that like I was
literally on the couch all weekend just
feeling miserable and I I cannot stand
to laying on the couch all day just like
watching TV and being meaningless to the
world like I just hate that being so
unproductive it drives me crazy so I've
been putting pressure on myself to get
back here and film videos which i think
is actually making me feel worse because
I'm like you guys do it little God
you're gonna do it but I'm incapable so
anyways just thought I would give that
disclaimer throw it out there if I seem
a little it's because I am a little
so anyways today's video I am going to
be doing a makeup tutorial on the look
that I wore on on in my June favorites
video which was two videos ago because I
have never my entire like time here on
YouTube ever had so many requests for a
makeup look that I was wearing so I'm
still getting tweets every day and
comments asking to see that makeup look
so I felt like it would be mean of me
not to do this makeup look for you guys
so anyways I did comment a few be back
telling you that it's a kind of similar
to the rose sparkle tutorial we get
totally different I mean like spoken
like a true makeup junkie right it's the
same but different but honestly it just
has like a similar look to that tutorial
but it is completely different honestly
so it is very girly it's very summery
it's very blurry it's very fun it's very
warm this is going to look good on green
blue and brown eyes it's just really
going to make them pop so I really hope
that you guys enjoy this tutorial as
much as I have enjoyed doing it this is
the fourth time I have worn this look in
the past couple of weeks I just I love
it this is like my favorite look on
myself right now I want to wear every
single day so I hope that you guys enjoy
it is really easy as you will see so
yeah let me know what you think I love
you guys as always thanks so much for
watching this video and I'll see you in
a couple days with another makeup
tutorial hi guys I'm so dizzy so as you
can see who's just one of those days
that I could not get going
I was like no please I just we're lay
around and cry but pull ourselves
together and get it going so I'm going
to go in with my favorite foundation of
life which is Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation I am using a makeup geek
Foundation sibling brush to apply this I
have been loving this brush recently I
know it's kind of weird so I'm not using
the Sigma f80 brush but I have been
going back and forth and this one is
just absolutely beautiful and I think
it's a better price as well so I'll link
that down below for those of you who
want to check it out so I'm just going
to blend this on the entire face and
then once I have done that I'm going to
go in with my concealer I'm using Mac
Pro Longwear concealer and shade NW 20
and NW 25 because I'm not really into
that stark white highlight anymore but I
don't want it to be as dark as my
foundation because I do a little
highlight I always make sure to run this
over the lid as well because this will
help prime it for eyeshadow whoo I was
kind of like a monster like a one-eyed
monster when I only have one eye of
concealer done it looks so tiny and
squinty and scared anyways I am using a
sigma f80 six to blend this out because
it's my favorite brush ever to blend out
concealer then I'm going to just set
that area I am using the banana color
powder from the Anastasia contour kit
just to set that under-eye area now once
we have done that oh sip of tea just
real quick
being sick sucks I'm going to go in with
makeup geek chickadee eye shadow I'm
going to use an e 40 brush from Sigma to
blend this in the crease this is an
orange eyeshadow with some peach in it
and it can look a little scary but if
you use a fat blending brush like I am
right now and just go nice and slow and
your strokes as you can see it does not
look like wow that's orange it honestly
just looks like a really beautiful glow
then I'm going to go in with Mango Tango
and I'm going to be using an e25 brush
to blend this out again this is from
makeup geek makeup geek are my favorite
eye shadows in the cosmetic and
street and the price is right so
blending this back and forth going from
all the way from inner corner to outer
corner I'm just going to mix it in with
that chickadee and then I always always
always go back with an e forty brush
just to buff that all out completely so
we don't have any harsh lines I do that
in between every single shadow then I'm
going to go in with Matt cosmetics
Brown script as you can see I'm a fan of
this since I have hit pan I think I've
gone through three or four of these
eyeshadows in my lifetime I just
absolutely love Brown script it's one of
my favorite colors ever so using that
same brush I'm going to dust again from
inner corner to outer corner and I
really do stress that you get all the
way in that inner corner all the way to
the outer corner that way it looks
really even and then again go back with
that same brush and just buff it out so
you have no harsh lines then I'm going
to go in with one more makeup geek
eyeshadow and this is called bitten I
don't know if I have used this in a
video before but this is one of my
favorite eyeshadows ever right now it is
such a beautiful brownie purple color it
is just so easy to use so again I'm
doing the same thing I've done with all
those other shadows and just buffing
from inner corner to outer corner it
just builds up that color and gives more
dimension by using all these different
shades then I'm going to go in with a
Stila
magnificent metal foils eyeshadow in the
shade metallic dusty rose oh mouthful
going in with Too Faced glitter glue I'm
just going to tap this all over my
eyelid using my finger doing this is
just going to make sure that any shadow
or payment that you go on is just going
to stick even if I'm not using a
glittery product I will use the glitter
glue because it will really hold it
literally like glue I find with these
steel eyeshadows using my finger works a
million times better than any brush look
at how gorgeous that is oh my gosh I'm
so obsessed with this eyeshadow it is
insane so I'm just packing it all over
the lid again using my finger I'm not
using a brush whatsoever and it gets the
job done great and quick
so from inner corner to outer corner
bottom being done then I'm going to fill
in my eyebrows I'm using the Anastasia
brow Wiz and my brows are a little
intense today but I'm not gonna lie this
is the first time I've done my makeup in
five days so I got a little heavy-handed
at times so no judgement but I am just
lightly sculpting out the brow area with
some concealer because I was a little
bit messy then I'm going to go in with
Mac
shroom eyeshadow and I'm going to just
highlight that brow bone this always
just completes that eyeshadow look and
just really blends it all together and
makes the eyebrow look really lifted and
everything looks much more glamorous
then I'm just coating my lashes with
some mascara I am using the miss manga
mascara I believe it's called just going
to run that over super quickly nothing
fancy
then I'm going to go in with an e 17
brush this is a brush from Sigma that I
have been using the past couple of weeks
that I'm obsessed with so all I'm going
to do is just tap this really tightly
against that lashline area and what it's
going to do is it's going to make the
base of my lashes a lot darker and make
my lashes look a lot thicker so that
when I go in with these falsies right
here everything is going to look so much
more amazing to say the least
so I am using velour wispy
sweet-nothings they're my favorite
lashes ever and then just using a pair
of tweezers I'm going to pop those on on
the lash line and you will see after
going over as you can see right now I
just go over that one more time just to
make sure that that entire false lash
line is jet-black again and it will
really just come together and look so
beautiful in the end then I'm going to
take some Brown script and any tight
line brush and I'm just going to buff
that out on that lower lash line area I
am using a makeup geek pencil brush to
buff this area out I have been loving
this pencil brush recently you can go
with anything down here Mango Tango
Brown script bitten I am using all three
of them and just buffing all of them out
but anything you want will work then I'm
going to go in with my favorite eyeliner
of life this is coastal reach by Mac I
have used it before and a couple of
tutorials but it's just my absolute
favorite it is a really beautiful warm
burgundy brown color and this looks
gorgeous on everybody Kim Kardashian
used to wear this eyeliner and it just
looked so beautiful on her brown eyes I
suggest it for every eye color it is so
phenomenally beautiful okay enough with
coastal region I'm now just coating my
lower lashes with mascara and doing a
horrible job of demonstrating that for
you outside of the camera I'm using mac
gigablack gigablack Lac gigablack lash
mascara woo then I'm going to contour
using Bobbi Brown golden light bronzer
I'm going to be using a makeup geek
brush so many makeup brushes today right
I know all my other brushes are dirty
and I'm just in love with these brushes
I'm going to be contouring with this
brush which has been
one of my favorite ways to contour
recently this brush is so tiny and dense
it makes it so easy to get in the house
of your cheekbones and really buff
everything out so I'm going to sculpt
out that cheekbone right underneath the
cheekbone area and then I'm going to
just blend that out on the temples and
the forehead as well make sure you blend
because a harsh contour is not cute on
anybody then we're going to go in with
makeup geek spellbound blush this is one
of my favorite blushes right now I
mentioned it in my monthly favourites it
is such a beautiful warm pink as you can
see on the cheekbones it is just
gorgeous I am going to top that off with
one more bra blush and this is called
summer fling again by makeup geek I just
had to do it exactly like I did in my
June favorites and this is what I was
wearing that day so I didn't want to do
anything differently so you guys could
get the exact same look then going in
with the beautiful Bobby Brown shimmer
brick in the shade beige this is the
most beautiful highlight oh my gosh it
is ridiculous
I am using a sigma tapered highlighter
brush just to hit the top of the
cheekbones and bring it down on the
cheek area and then I put a little bit
on the chin and a tiny bit on the
Cupid's bow as well that I'll just make
everything look much more even and glowy
now we're going to go in with BH
Cosmetics forever nude lipstick you can
see how incredibly nuda is it's so
pretty the color reminds me a lot of mac
cosmetics mith lipstick but oh I don't
know like a quarter of the price cheaper
then I'm going to go in with color your
smile butter cream lip gloss this is a
lip gloss that I created thank you so
much to those of you who have tried it
and been loving it and sending me
pictures you guys are the sweetest now
I'm going to set everything by just
using Urban Decay chill makeup setting
spray and we are done I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching I love you and I'll see you
soon bye
