Instagram and got so many comments and
requests for a tutorial on this look so
here we go
so first thing I'm doing is taking mac
prolongwear concealer I'm using shade
and w20 on myself but I'm going to use
this as an eyeshadow primer priming your
eyes is the most important step when
applying your eyeshadow if you have not
heard me say before in this concealer
because the technology it has in it not
to crease and settle on the fine lines
works beautifully as an eyeshadow primer
so then I'm taking the shade bamboo this
is a different shade that I normally
start with so it's kind of exciting okay
so I'm going to take on a big fluffy
brush as always and I'm going to dust it
in my crease all over the place no rhyme
or reason as always um today's look it's
going to be really blown out in the
outer corner but more put-together in
the inner corner so on that outer corner
you can feel free to get as messy as you
want um I can't help myself I am gonna
go with a little bit of soft brown just
because I really want a base that's kind
of rosy and bamboo wasn't dark enough
for my skin tone if you're really fair
then bamboo would be awesome but I
really needed a little something else
cuz I'm gonna go in with some darker
shades and the point of the shade is to
make everything really seamless that you
put on top of it so I'm going to go in
with mylar and this is another eyeshadow
by Mac on a flat shader brush this is
the 242 brush and I am just going to
press that all over my inner lid as you
can see I'm only going about half way if
maybe only quarter and I'm really making
sure I get it in that inner corner even
up into that inner crease I really want
that inner area to be very highlighted
so make sure you concentrate mainly
there and don't take this out far I'm
going to take texture which you've seen
me use before and I'm going to take it
on a 217 goat hair brush and I'm using a
go hair because it's going to apply it
nice and sheer I don't want this to be
really thick or pigmented once again
this is just another caramel base color
that we're going to put on top before we
go in with a couple more darker shades
as you can see I'm do using this at my
lower crease and I am bringing this in
fairly far and I'm just kind of
dustiness everywhere I don't need this
in any precise way all over on that
lit about halfway in is where we want
this to go I'm going to take brown
script as you can see I'm using my
favorite shades I think I've used all
these shades before but today I'm
showing you a new way to use them which
i think is fun since you already see me
use them in the more generic easy
everyday ways if you have gone out and
bought in those colors which I know a
lot of you have you now have another way
to use them and if not you can
definitely get dupes for these shades I
know that Maybelline has some great
dupes
for the shades I'm using right now that
are really pigmented so anyways back to
what I'm talking about I'm putting this
deep in the lower crease I do not want
to take this very far if at all above my
crease on my outer corner I'm keeping
this pretty low and as you can see when
I get to the crease I'm kind of turning
my brush sideways just so that it
doesn't go flying up and make like a
really strict intense dense line I'm
taking Swiss chocolate and I'm going to
just pack this really low once again in
that outer corner I don't want to take
this up any further than I took the one
before I want this to stay deep
especially because I'm gonna go in with
a really thick liner which is going to
really help and emphasize this look a
lot and I want that Swiss chocolate to
be right on the outer corner of my liner
right by the little wing that I'm going
to put on my liner just because that'll
really give more dimension and depth to
the eye and make it look smokier than it
actually is
oh by the way I was just using a clean
brush going over the very top of
everything I just did just to buff it
all out I wasn't going in with any
additional product but now I'm using a
rule going back with this really big
fluffy brush this is unnecessary if you
don't want to Orange but I want a little
pop of orange up there on my outer
corner just because it's going to really
complement the purple under my eye so
I'm taking a little tiny eyeliner brush
that I just showed and I am doing my
eyeliner and I'm showing a tiny little
clip of it just to show you that I am
doing a wing if you want to look at an
eyeliner video in depth of how I do this
I do have one here on my channel I'll
link it below you can also just type in
eyeliner on my channel to search it so
that I'm going to use graftobian
corrector palette I love this palette I
got it from leh cosmetics calm awesome
website I'm a
palate and I'm going to use that
lightest shade just to highlight along
the face and I'm going to put it down
the bridge of the nose around the nose
under the eye area right on the very top
on arch high point of the brow chin yeah
I like being really stupid okay so then
I'm going to take both these foundations
both a drugstore and a Mac Foundation
they are both my absolute favorite right
now I'm going to mix them together and
I'm going to blend out that highlight
this brush this Sigma f80 it actually
broke on me and I contacted Sigma and
they replaced it for me immediately no
questions asked so I thought that was
really cool that they demonstrated such
great customer service so I'm very
impressed by them because I was really
sad when that brush just fell to pieces
for no reason um I'm taking my Beauty
Blender after I blend it out I took my
Beauty Blender with no product on it at
all and I just tapped it all over my
face just to absorb any additional
foundation that's going to possibly cake
up throughout the day I have found a
love for this Beauty Blender especially
used like this just to absorb the excess
foundation that you don't need sitting
on your face for absolutely no reason
I'm also using it to apply my concealer
because it makes it lightning fast and I
no longer have to spend you know like
three or four minutes on my concealer
it's literally like 30 seconds and I'm
done so I'm going to take this huge
brush and I'm a bronzer by Mac it's
actually a mineralized powder and shade
dark and I'm going to take this and I'm
going to just slightly contour on the
corners besides my face sorry I'm tired
right now but I'm still making the
effort to make this video so I'm sorry
if I'm stuttering all over the place I'm
not just contouring though definitely
bronzing more than anything I really
want my cheeks to be bronzed today and
not really contoured I want the focus to
be on my eyes because I really really
love this look so the face I'm trying
just to keep on the bronzy side no crazy
contouring know crazy blush so I'm just
kind of buffing it out bringing it down
my neck you always want to bring it down
your neck a little bit I'm going to show
you a little sneak peak of my eyebrows
because my eyebrows are the most
requested tutorial that I get on YouTube
and Instagram and Facebook you guys
asked for and I brought tutorial all the
time so I just low
I line the bottom of them with this flat
to12 brush by Mac and I use the shade
cork it's an eyeshadow and then I just
follow along I do the top and then I
round out on the outer corner and that's
about it everything you're seeing is
what I do so then I'm taking this Mac
Pro which you can only get at a pro
store there are a few of them but there
they are around and I'm taking this
highlighter shade buy them I'll list the
names of everything in this tutorial
below including this and I'm gonna dab
it all underneath my eye I love this
highlighter I can't use it when I'm
really tan so I'm really embracing it
now that I'm more fair because it's
really really light and it's got a
little shimmer in it so now for the fun
part I'm going to take max sketch
eyeshadow same brush it's a 2-1 to the
same one I use it for my eye brows it's
just a different brush different one
same brush though okay that's kind of
confusing I'm going to push this really
tight all against my lower lash line
okay so you're not really concentrating
on the way it looks right now you're
just getting that color and the
pigmentation on there so you can go back
and work with it in a minute so it's
going to look you know kind of jaggedy
and really line the eyes thick not so
cute but that's okay because we're going
to go in with a pencil brush and a shade
called satellite dreams any medium
lightish tone shade especially with
shimmer will really help you out because
that shimmer will help blend out this
product as opposed to another matte
which can kind of just do the opposite
effect and kind of chunk up so I'm just
taking this and I'm just working this
brush from inner to outer corner and I'm
allowing this to kind of be as sloppy as
it wants as strange as that sounds for
the under eye area but I really want
this to just kind of be blown out and
really purple and just give like a
really falling out underneath the eye
smokey effect if you know what I mean
this is what really makes this look
Alpine bronzed is a mineralized blush
that came out with the praised chic
collection at Mac and I bought this like
two weeks ago
and I have not gone a day without
wearing it I'm not kidding it is I think
my favorite blush that I've ever used in
my entire life which is insane because I
am obsessed with blush like addicted I
have to have every blush color in the
world or I'm just I can't sleep at night
but seriously it's a great great color
so I'm popping on eyelashes same
eyelashes I use anytime I ever wear
false lashes they're by red cherry
number 43 and then I'm going to just
highlight my under eye area with mylar
the same eyeshadow that I used on my
inner corner I'm doing that in between
apply my next false lash as the glue is
setting on it I'm just rubbing that all
over there I don't a really shiny look
because once again I want all the
emphasis to be on my eyes and eyeshadow
not any shimmer or highlight going on so
then I'm just going to make sure that
this lash is on nice and tight and then
I'm going to apply any black mascara the
black or the butter for this part and
I'm going to just tap it on underneath
my false lashes on to my natural ones
just to kind of bind the two together
try to be aware of your false lashes
because if you get a bunch of mascara on
your false lashes it'll definitely
lessen the life of them and they won't
look as natural and it's just a pain so
try to avoid those I'm using Mac's angel
lip glass they came out with all their
most popular lipsticks and lip gloss
form and gorgeous it's like snob and
Saint Germain
pretty please and angel is my absolute
favorite so all these gorgeous colors
are not on lip gloss so I'm obsessed
this is was what I was wearing my
Instagram picture and I had so many
comments and messages beyond messages of
people asking me what color this was so
angel gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
I'm just topping it off with a little
mascara on my bottom lashes because I
can't go without it just kind of spy
rahman al ittle bit and then after that
you are all finished so here's the
completed look I really hope you enjoy
this it's a great way to bring yourself
into the spring trend so have a good day
you guys I love you mmm bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
