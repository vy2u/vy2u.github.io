up to just like wanted to be a part of
the fun so today I'm going to be doing a
question and answer for you and this is
not at all I had planned so basically
long story short if you don't follow me
on snapchat what happened was I was
sitting down to film my first fall
makeup look for you guys and a couple
days ago two days ago to be exact I use
a new sunless tanning pot all over my
face and it gave me a reaction you can
see I have like a bump here I have it
some situations here and a cluster right
here and my right eyelid has like
hundreds of tiny little microscopic
bumps and when I applied makeup it
burned and it hurts so bad that I was
like mmm we're not doing this so I took
off my makeup I got on snapchat I let
you guys know the deal and almost all of
you guys are asking for me to film a
video with no makeup on and do a
question and answer on snapchats for you
so that is exactly what I am going to be
doing so I apologize in the delay of the
fall makeup look but it will be out in a
couple of days so until then let's see
some questions I'm actually happy to be
doing this video with no makeup on
because it's a reminder to the young
girls out there watching my videos that
you don't have to wear makeup to be
comfortable in your own skin even if you
have a crooked nose or if you're having
a reaction or breakouts whatever it may
be or your lips are uneven these are all
issues that I have with myself
personally but who care it is not always
about your outer beauty it's not always
about the new hottest beauty products
and the beauty trends I know that's what
I sit here and I talk about constantly
on my channel but that's because this is
a beauty channel but at the end of the
day I am fully aware that these are not
the things that truly matter in life
they're fun things and they're like
sprinkles on top of the cupcakes but you
have to have the cupcake and the cupcake
itself is who you are inside and that
might sound cheesy but that's very
important for me to know that the young
girls watching my videos are always
aware of you know if I meet a subscriber
in public whether she is wearing the
most bang doubt cat eye or she has no
makeup at all I love and appreciate you
and I remember your face I remember your
smile it doesn't matter if you're
wearing makeup or not so now I have
that out there in the open let's jump in
to the snapchat question an answer so
I'm going to ask you guys on snapchat
right now to send me questions and we'll
answer them snap me your questions right
now and we're going to do a snapchat
question and answer only on snapchat not
Twitter I hope that it sound bitchy
sometimes I might do it just don't you I
don't know I can get kind of intense
sometimes and like say things was so
much like that I sound sassy I don't
like that but okay let's do this oh my
god so cute on that woman's snapchat her
question across the screen says what is
the best cure for depression um I really
want to make a video dedicated to my
story with anxiety and depression but I
can't sit here and tell you the cure I
am NOT a doctor I I can't sit there and
tell you that but I do plan on making a
dedicated video at some point all about
my story because if you guys don't know
I have suffered with anxiety panic
attacks and depression since I was a
teenager I've been diagnosed with all
different things diagnosed with
agoraphobia social anxiety generalized
anxiety panic attacks depression many
different things I've been diagnosed
with over the past few years so I've
definitely had a struggle um fighting
depression and anxiety but I really do
want to make a whole video dedicated on
that but I keep putting it off because
it's gonna be a really really hard video
to film and it's probably gonna make me
very emotionally drained and I'm just
nervous for do see like my neck is
getting red and patchy
yeah that's anxiety my neck gets red and
patchy all the time when I get anxious
and it's funny because my first start
YouTube my neck was always beet red and
people were always like your foundation
doesn't match your neck and it's because
I was so anxious about being on camera
making videos that my neck was red from
anxiety and then when I would turn off
the camera within 10 minutes the redness
would go away weird right but I always
get red and patchy oh I love you so much
and what was your favorite thing to do
during the summer oh my god long queue
okay so my everything to do during the
summer now as an adult I don't have
anything it because it's so hot here in
Florida that during the summer is not
when I do activities the fall in the
winter want to actually get to go out
and do stuff um
going up during the summer was riding my
bike and skateboarding I would ride my
bike everywhere and I was like such a
little like punk skater girl but I was
like so like skateboarder ow
so she asked if I could collab with any
makeup brand worldwide who would it be
and what product would it be and you
know what's funny is if you ask me this
a year ago I would have said Becca and I
would have said I would have created a
highlighter and now that is exactly
what's happened I haven't even thought
into the future past anything like I
mean I am working on other things right
now that are extremely exciting and I
can't wait to come out um but if I had
to pick anything else what brand would I
pick honest to god you guys I don't
think I would pick anything I'm so
beyond content and satisfied with my
life in my career right now I don't even
there's no there's no one like I'm so
happy with my collaboration with bat god
I'm so happy with the things I have in
the works right now that I don't have
anything really
um and then her next question was are
you ever going to come out with your own
line that is in no way a collaboration
with any other brand and yes I have
answered this a couple times before but
yes I am currently working on should I
show you guys ah no I'm not gonna show
you guys I have a prototype of something
but I'm not going to show you but yes
I'm currently working on something that
is 100% Jaclyn hill I am the one that is
paying for it I am my only investor and
it is my product that I'm coming out for
you guys I've been working on it for
almost two full years it's been 23
months I've been working on it so yeah
coming soon coming soon oh my god
they're coming in so quickly that
they're not loading I'm tapping them to
load they're not vote now my brother is
calling me what
sorry I'm in the middle of filming
that's why I'm like intense like do you
see how quickly these are coming in do
you do see how I'm trying to like tap
them to load them what the heck this
sucks my phone is like not keeping up
with
how quickly they're coming in actually a
really good question so since I have
completely dropped the announcement that
I am collabing with makeup geek um how
do I put this without like putting
anyone on okay so basically my
collaboration with makeup geek was
supposed to launch this fall but then
there was an issue with like inventory
and shipping and all that jazz I'm not
going to get into long story short I
have another collaboration I'm working
on that is supposed to launch in
December and so because I have that
coming in December me and makeup geek we
decided to take my palette and put it in
the beginning of next year
so now makeup geek is getting pushback
because makeup geek is also
collaborating with somebody else and so
that we're kind of switching things
around like they're taking the place of
me we're switching and then I have
something else coming out in December
and then my palette coming out next year
I know it's very confusing it's a lot um
but yes the makeup e palette will be
launching next year it is absolutely
beautiful I've given you guys a few
swatches on snapchat before a lot of
bronzes topes oranges just very me um
yeah so that is coming out next year but
I have other things coming out before
then my gosh that's so hard I could go
anywhere in the world where would it be
there's so many places that I would fly
to if it was just like a five-hour
flight but every place that I want to go
is so far I need to fly over water in
the dark and I'm like I mean my ultimate
dream is to go to Santorini and Greece
oh my god
it literally looks like heaven on earth
love to go to Italy love France I would
love to go to like the countryside of
France with like all the little like
homes and cottages I love it so yeah I
want to go to Italy I want to go to
France I wanna go to Santorini
those are my three places I want to go
so bad
for you when you started getting into me
oh she's so beautiful okay so how old
was I when I start getting into makeup
there really is no age we were just
talking about this when we were in Vegas
someone from Sephora asked my mom like
how old was she was she start getting
into makeup and like what did you think
about it did you encourage her her dream
and her chosen path and my mom was like
I never had a choice I start getting
into makeup when I was like not even
walking yet I would steal my mom's
lipsticks and hide them underneath in my
bed when I was like two-and-a-half years
old my mom would give me chopsticks for
my birthdays and Christmases when I was
like three because those were lip sticks
to me so she would give me chopsticks
and I had like a hoard a huge box like a
hoarding chapsticks that I was like my
lipsticks my makeup what is my favorite
animal and why I love lions
I think lions are so cool so giraffes
when I was 10 years old and we went to
Africa one time and we took a safari we
saw like the wild elephants and giraffes
and lions and tigers and that was like
the most amazing experience of my entire
life
so I would have to say one of those I
just think lions and tigers are so cool
how loud they can roar and how fast they
can run John always says if I were an
animal I would be a tiger I don't know
why but he said that ever since we were
dating he always tells me is like he
looks so much of a tiger I'm like what I
don't take that as a strong compliment
but he's trying to give me one so I'll
accept it I want to show you guys
Georgie hold on I know it's so random
but you guys didn't see him with his new
haircut look at Georgie with no no top
knot look a little baby he's so round
isn't he I know he's complaining he's
like mom these lights not happening
you're Frankie come here let me show
them your haircut come here
where are you you guys haven't seen him
in a long
I'm there he is he's gotten so big can
you believe it that's him look how tired
both of my dogs are he is the sweetest
dog in the world you guys like I swear
look at him he's the sweetest most like
a gentle kind hearted dog you will ever
meet like are you kidding falling asleep
right here so sweet now that I'm done
making up to my dogs let's get back to
snapchat do the things that he likes do
my phone keeps freezing oh oh
I once knew a personal favorite like bad
boy man that you obsessed over when you
were little what was my personal
favorite boy band I obsessed over when I
was little um and sink first sure like
everyone was like debating over who was
better and sinker Backstreet Boys and to
me I was like no contest like are you
kidding me why are you even having a
battery boy conversation like I was in
love with NSYNC and I was in love with
Justin Timberlake like in love but then
I got over the boy band stage like
really quickly and moved on to actors by
the time I was like 12 maybe even 11 and
I had such a hardcore crush on Josh
Hartnett like you have no idea an Ashton
Kutcher like you don't know my crush on
Ashton Kutcher oh my god when dude
where's my car came out I think it was
13 I was done like I was so in love with
him I even made like a music video for
him when I was 13 years old it was a
good joke but I sang on the Mariah Carey
song all I want for Christmas is you and
I like dressed up like such a weirdo and
I was like standing under mistletoe and
I was like fake bawling my eyes out like
making myself look super ugly and I have
like all these posters of Ashton Kutcher
it sounds so creepy but I did it like as
a joke and that video like went viral
throughout my family and everyone in my
family was so obsessed with it and
thought it was so funny and we actually
lost the footage of it which I died like
I
believe I lost it we lost it when I
moved um from Boston to Tampa
we lost the footage and if I still had
that footage I would put it here on
YouTube for you guys because it was the
most ridiculous over-the-top video you
guys could see what a little creative
weirdo I was when I was 13 years old but
yeah I was in love with Ashton Kutcher I
know that question was about my boy
bands but it just transferred over to my
lover Ashton Kutcher and I look back and
I'm like good times Jacqueline good
times
phone is like legit freezing and not
where do you see yourself years where do
I see myself with John in ten years well
happily married I would hope and living
in a big house two cars in the garage I
say a big house because I mentioned this
before but my whole life I've always had
a dream of having a very very big
beautiful home that I can host my family
dinners and Christmas get-togethers and
Thanksgiving parties and that's just I'm
very family-oriented and it's the cancer
and me apparently I just found out
recently that like because I'm a cancer
that makes me like super family-oriented
and I'm a homebody and my home is very
important to me so I've always had a
dream of having big huge house and two
cars and you know a big pool in the
backyard so that all my nieces and
nephews can come and play and have
sleepovers and just host big
get-togethers the home filled with love
so yeah that is where I see us and John
myself and John in ten years I literally
can't even click because they're coming
in so fast and I'm topping them to load
them and then it freezes so I have to
ask everyone to head over to Twitter
instead and ask me questions there
because this is not working anymore guys
head over to Twitter and ask me
questions it since fall is coming and I
live in the very cold state Montana what
is your favorite hot drink from
Starbucks oh my god you have got to get
the salted caramel hot chocolate what is
your name Danielle Danielle you've got
to get the salt and caramel hot
chocolate and it's not a coffee drink
but they also have a salted caramel
latte
salted caramel hot chocolate will change
your life the second it comes out in the
fall I am so sickly obsessed I go to
Starbucks like every single day and I
even try to make it at home but it's not
the same at home it's just not it's not
same so I take my niece's to Starbucks
all the time in the fall in the winter
salted caramel hot chocolate inga asks
matte lip or glossy mom that's so hard
because I would say overall glossy but
this time of year coming up Matt yes
Matt Megan Richardson asks best palette
for cool toned smokey eyes um I would
say the new Kat Von D eye palette is the
shade light eye it is so beautiful like
the grays and the black and just the
medium tone Browns
I really really like that palette
especially for their cool tones if you
can only use one makeup part for the
rest of your life what would it be oh my
god what would it be
yeah mascara no it's so basic um you
know what it would be it would be a
cream bronzer oblate the Chanel Soleil
did tan whatever the heck that thing is
called bronzer or like the terra cotta
like spray bronzer it'll be a bronzer
that's what it would be because I feel
like you know if you're going to wear
nothing at all if you can like warm up
the face with like a cream bronzer it
just gives you like bronzer Morgan asked
would you ever get a tattoo what would
you get if you did just because John has
so many have you ever thought about it
yes John and absolutely covered in
tattoos and I love it I think that he
looks super cool and it totally fits
John no I will never get a tattoo I have
had a lot of ideas of tattoos that I
would love to get but I've never
actually followed through with them um I
will tell you guys the tattoo that I
wanted to get for like three years
and I still would love to have it but
I'm not going to but I'll tell you guys
in case any of you think it's cool you
can go ahead and get it for me and I can
live through you um but I've always
wanted to get a tattoo right here like
not on the actual neck but not like on
the actual back like right this is
awkward like right here I would love to
get a tattoo right there that says
destroy what destroys you because that
is one of my favorite lines ever and I
have told myself that since I was 16
years old it's like very powerful short
and to the point but encouraging it just
makes you feel like you're like you can
take on the world so I would love to get
that right there on my back and I also
thought that it would be cool like one
day if I had kids you know like how cute
kids signatures are when they're only
like five years old like they're in like
preschool like first grade their
signatures are so adorable I would love
to get like my child's signature like on
the back of my neck or like on my wrist
right here like their little sloppy
signature just cuz I think that that
would be so cute like of just having
like that memory like your child when
they first learned how to write their
letters I don't know I just think that
like that would be really cool too
random stuff what advice do you have for
new girls starting out on YouTube um
just to stay true to yourself and I know
that that sounds like cheesy and simple
but it's not simple because once you
start getting like the rise to fame here
on YouTube and brands start reaching out
to you and companies start reaching out
to you and people want you to talk about
some product like the pet corrector and
they're like we want to pay your
thousands of dollars and you're like but
I don't even like this it's not always
easy to turn down a big paycheck
especially when you've got bills coming
in so um stay true to yourself and when
you start YouTube start it for the right
reasons start it because whatever it is
if your channel is about whether it's
cooking beauty fashion whatever do it
because you love it and continue to
remind yourself every day I'm doing this
because I love it not to please people
not to make money but because I love it
and remind yourself that before you get
on camera because people can see that
and people can feel that um I've always
said like the second I stops loved
YouTube I'm done like I do this because
I love it I love sitting here I love
talking to you guys I love my
subscribers I love meeting you whenever
a subscriber comes up to me in public
and is like I'm so sorry to bother you
I'm like don't you dare apologize and I
grab them and I hugged them because it's
always good to meet you guys like I
genuinely love this and yes there's
haters and yes they're gonna bring you
down at times and you're gonna get upset
and you're gonna spend a day crying
imbedded or once in a while but doesn't
matter the good sober doesn't that and
I'm getting off on a tangent I was
trying to tell you guys my advice to you
and then I start talking about
subscribers and haters um but stay true
to yourself Laura Marie asks can you
describe what your makeup style was as a
teenager yeah aha
if you could change your eye color what
would it be hmm
I would probably say brown because brown
eyes are so beautiful and I know all the
brown eyed girls out there are like oh
my god like why do brown eyed girls hate
their eye color so much I don't know any
time I would ever work on a model who
had brown eyes I'd be like I think brown
eyes are so beautiful you guys can do so
many things to make your brown eyes pop
and you can wear so many colors there's
so much trickier with someone with light
eyes so I love right and 9 v of my eyes
I like my eyes but I love brown eyes so
if I had a change I would switch to
brown or like a pure grain because I
have green and blue like pure green is
so rare my niece has just pure green and
I think it's gorgeous April asked
looking back at your life and how it
used to be before YouTube did you ever
imagine being at a place that you are
now um oh yes and no a very strong yes
and in a very strong no I never saw
myself doing this but it's really funny
because I will say that like for me
personally I feel like if anything makes
me believe in God it's where I am right
now in my life because there is no
question that my whole life has led up
to what I am doing the fact that I've
been interested in makeup since I was a
little girl and the fact that I was so
interested in video ography and
photography and then those two came
together and created the situation
that's going on right now but at the
same time when John I got married I was
only 19 years old
and we had absolutely nothing like not a
penny in our pocket we started our
marriage with just the money that we had
gotten from friends and family at our
wedding and we had just basic jobs you
know what I'm saying like I was working
at Mac in Tampa and he was working at a
restaurant serving and so it was just
and we could barely pay our bills even
doing that it was so difficult and we
went through the hardest times ever I
mean it got worse and worse and worse
for like two and a half years just not
being able to make ends meet I know I'm
going off on like a really big rant
right now I'm not meaning to talk so
much about the situation but anyways
even when our life was miserable and
even when I mean we
afford Wi-Fi or cable for years we
didn't have those things until we've
been married for like three three and a
half years we could not afford Wi-Fi in
cable that was a very big luxury to us
um so I remember like when you just lay
on the bed lay on the couch all the time
we weren't working so we had no money to
do anything no money to go anywhere so
we just sit around constantly if we want
at work and I remember even then just
always saying to John like this is
temporary things are going to get better
like things are going to be amazing one
day like John I'm telling you like one
day we're going to be driving a Mercedes
we're going to have a beautiful home
like it's good it's going to happen like
I always believed in myself and I always
believed in us and I look at other
people and I'm like they're working
their asses off and they're making it
work so I can't - you don't saying
that's why I'm always saying that to you
guys I'm always try and remind you like
don't look at me and think like oh my
god she's just so lucky or she's just so
this like you can have this - I am NOT
like special I am NOT like God's gift to
the world sorry it's thundering you are
God's gift to the world - and you can do
the exact same thing as me you can have
a product in Sephora you can make
youtube videos you know I started using
a lamp as my lighting and like a $40
camera from China so you can do it - so
to answer that question did I see myself
here no not really but at the same time
I've always believed in myself I've
always believed that hard work pays off
and believing in yourself pays off and
having a positive attitude pays off so
it was a really long answer but yes and
no crystal asks do you think you'll ever
do a live makeup class where we could
come and see your magic in person I
actually would love to do that I've
thought about that I'm doing like a live
seminar and having you know like a
couple hundred tickets sold and like
renting out like a hotel or something
having people come and do a live thing
basically what you see on camera but in
person and I would use a model of course
I think that would be super fun but the
reason I haven't actually acted upon it
is because I hate the idea of charging
people to do things you know I'm saying
I've had a lot of people reach out to me
and asked if I would like to do like a
livestream class it's $1 to watch like
an hour and a half long and it's $1.00
to watch and I would work on a model and
I've turned it all down because I just
don't like the idea of charging you guys
$1 to see something when I can do it
right here on YouTube um so doing a live
class would be so fun but I just don't
like it
of charging you guys and want to know
where make you pit you know I'm saying
you know I'm saying
Cecile asks what is your favorite
friends episode mine is with the holiday
armadillo penis I love you hope your
eyelid gets better I love you too Cecile
okay what is your favorite French
episode
think like one of my favorites is the
one where Phoebe gets like the record

times and I still cannot watch that

that's her name Jada princess asks if
you had the chance to go to space would
you
hell no oh my god space is like my
booboo below hmm space is like my
biggest fear in the world I think it is
so amazing that astronauts can do what
they do when I was a little kid I wanted
to go to space so bad but oh my god the
thought of going up out of our
atmosphere to the galaxy and looking at
the planet that we live on
oh that brianna asks if you could have
any car in the world what would it be I
love you so much I love you so much -
Briana any car in the world would be a
Mercedes g-wagen like I dream you need

before on Twitter like probably two
years ago the second that I saw that car
oh my god I'm gonna have it like I will
have that car one day I will I will have
it just ask me love you Jacqueline I
love you too Jess she said I was
wondering how you deal with body

really care about that and I really
don't like I've gained 20-something
pound 23 pounds since I've been on
YouTube when I started YouTube I was 98
pounds somewhere around there um I was
very unhealthy and now I'm 122 so I've

blew up when I was 13 years old like you
know I've got the situation going on
down there it happens and I've seen a
few people leave comments like oh my god

that her face is getting fatter don't
you think it's like the fact that you
guys are calling me fat is so ridiculous
like I don't I don't struggle with the
body image thing and even if I gain more
weight get over it my body and not yours
if you're never gonna hear me talking
about someone else's body like oh my god
like who cares it's their body
let them be you know as long as it's not
like it's a member of mine that is
unhealthy like people just need to get
out of other people's business and stop
pointing fingers everyone else and just
deal with their own issues that's how I
feel
