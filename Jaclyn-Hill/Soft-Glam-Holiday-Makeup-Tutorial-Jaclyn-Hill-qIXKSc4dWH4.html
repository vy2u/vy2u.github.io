my first holiday look I am super excited
to be doing this oh my gosh so the story
behind this yes there's a story as
always
so I uploaded my vlogmas just a couple
of days ago and if you guys watch that
then you would see that I have my
friends in town in that middle vacation
and then I got sick to top it off and
it's like the number of new sickness but
anyways because of that I haven't gotten
around to doing holiday looks and I have
all these ideas and everything and so
last night I was setting up my lights
and everything to film this morning and
I wanted to do something like really
crazy colorful and glittery and just
like painting the holidays and then I
was like you know what yes those things
might be fun but we're ready in the
middle of the month and I thought I want
to do something it's more neutral and
wearable for you guys that are actually
watching this video because even though
it can be fun to watch something like
glittering over the top and like what
like you know like not actually useful
for the average woman and we're already
in mid December so it's like I figured
let's just do something that like you
guys can actually take tips from you
guys can actually use for yourself at
home you know what I'm saying so I I
love this look it's like a very soft cut
crease we have some glitter in there but
it's not too much not overboard I just
think that this is very subtle but at
the same time
screams the holidays you compare this
eye with any lip color that you want
right now I'm wearing OCC lip tar in the
shade harlot I thought it said Marlowe
harlot is what I am wearing so yeah oh
my god and I teeth is wearing it too
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys so much I hope you enjoyed this
tutorial and I'll see you soon bye so
I'm going to be starting off priming my
eyes because we are going to start with
our eyes today since we are using
glitter I don't start with my foundation
because the glitter can fall down and
kind of ruin the foundation so starting
with eyes I'm going in with Mac kid eyes
shadow this is a great transition color
if you're familiar with soft Brown it's
kind of similar just a little bit cooler
and lighter in tone which I absolutely
love so using an e 40 brush from Sigma
I'm going to concentrate this on the
upper crease of my eye I'm trying to
kind of avoid the lid just be
we are going to do a soft cut crease
today now I'm going in with a morphe
eyeshadow and this is number 62 this is
a little bit darker than kid and it's
very neutral and tone so it's not going
to be too warm or too cool using a sigma
e25 I'm going to just put that again in
that upper crease area kind of trying to
avoid the lid once we have that on I'm
going to go in with another morphe
shadow and this is number 15 which is
much warmer in tone I'm going to take a
makeup geek blending brush you can go in
the same 25 this was just laying there
so I just use it for you know no really
different reason but I'm going to again
do the exact same thing with this and
I'm going to just start buffing
everything upward again just avoiding
that lid board the fact that we are
doing a soft cut crease then I go in
with an e 40 from Sigma always this is
like the magic wand in my collection
just to buff everything out and make
sure that we have no harsh lines then
I'm going to go in with Mac shroom this
is very loved in my house as you can see
I go through probably I would say one of
these a year because I just absolutely
love it it's gorgeous all over the lid
it's gorgeous as a brow bone highlight
as a cheek highlight it works pretty
much on all skin tones it's just a great
color so using a 242 brush from Mac I'm
going to just press this all over the
lid and I'm going to help it to carve
help carve out that lid area even more
so we have more of a defined cut crease
as you can see I will push that up on
the entire lid up into that crease area
to kind of erase some of the brown that
fell down on our lid this will just help
define it just a little bit more and
then as always I will go back with a
blending brush and just ever so slightly
make sure that we have no harsh lines
because even though I'm doing a slight
cut crease I still don't want it to be
too harsh so now taking a makeup geek
pencil brush and makeup geek corrupt
eyeshadow which is a very black intense
shadow I'm going to just ever so
slightly press this shadow on my upper
lash line only on the outer corner of my
eye this will give kind of like a
romantic soft smoky effect but I love
doing this only on the outer corner and
leaving the inner corner blank because I
just think that it really gives you like
that cat eye and it's just very romantic
as opposed to lining everything which
can be a little bit more dramatic and a
little bit more harsh Plus this brush
makes this step just like foolproof
anyone can do it then I'm going to go
with a pencil brush and literally just
buff it back and forth with really no
rhyme or reason just so that it's not
harsh whatsoever because I do not want
it to be too black or too intense at all
I want it to be nice and soft and subtle
so now for the fun part I'm going to be
going in with MAC Cosmetics loose
glitter and this is in the shade reflex
pearl this is a Mac Pro item mine is
from an old Wonder Woman collection but
you can still get it online on just the
regular mac cosmetics website to adhere
that to the eyes I am using Too Faced
shadow insurance and glitter glue I put
this on the back of my hand and then I
kind of pick it up with a 242 brush
anything that's flat and I press that
glitter all over the lid and then I
immediately put my brush in the glitter
and I start dabbing if you do this your
glitter will not move it will not fall
on your face it will not crease this
glitter glue is everything there are
many different brands that have glitter
glue but I just love this one it's like
my tried-and-true it literally is like
superglue for glitter I absolutely love
it I've never had an issue with it so I
put it all over my lid and then
immediately within 10 seconds I pack on
that glitter while it's still tacky now
I'm gonna go in with flutter lashes in
the style Kim oh my gosh I love these
lashes they are so fun they're like
halfsies lashes so they're not going to
go on your entire lash line they're only
going to go on the outer corner but they
are so cool I was not expecting to love
them as much as I do but look at how
awesome that is like it's just a little
extra something so I didn't want to go
overboard the lashes because I wanted
the inner corner to be nice and subtle
and kind of blank and I wanted the outer
corner to have more like a romantic kind
of flirty vibe so I love these lashes
for that purpose I'm going to be priming
my face and I'm using hourglass veil and
I'm gonna rub that all over and then I'm
gonna go in with what do you know the
same foundation as always Giorgio Armani
luminous silk I'm using shade 6.5 and no
it does not match my face whatsoever but
it does match my neck and that is what
we want to color match it with I need to
get my sunless tanner on though because
this is not a good look for me so yeah I
need to remind me to do that later thank
you moving on I'm going to go ahead and
conceal my under eye area I'm using Mac
Pro Longwear concealer which is
tried and trued absolute favorite
concealer ever ever ever ever for the
under eye area I'm mixing shades
nw20 and NW 25 just to get my perfect
color I really wish that they would make
like an W 22.5 because hello I need it
up in here using a damp Beauty Blender
I'm going to blend that concealer out
towards the temples just to kind of give
a slight sculpted lifted look to the
face then I'm going to set my under eye
concealer as always i'm using anastasia
banana powder from her contour kits i
also mix it with mac pro emphasize
shaping powder I am using a tapered
highlighting brush from Sigma which is
ideal for that under-eye area then I'm
going to use a mineralized skinfinish
from Mac and shade medium plus and I'm
just going to put powder on my nose
because I don't like a shiny nose I'm
totally out of focus here for my brows
so I'm gonna move right past that
because I just did a brow video and I
will link it down below so after my
brows I am highlighting my brow bone
using the same color that we used on the
lid which is shroom by Mac then to
finish off the eye area I'm going to
take the same black shadow from makeup
geek and I'm going to just put that only
on the outer corner of my lower lash
line and then buff it out with a pencil
brush as you can see it took two seconds
I don't really want it to be perfect
under there I want it to be a little
messy just to kind of give that soft
romantic feel and then on the inner
corner I'm just going to highlight as
well using any highlight that you want I
think I'm using shroom here I might be
using crystal avalanche because they're
right next to each other in my palette
but whatever you want I'm putting a
quick coat of mascara on my lower lashes
I'm using a Rimmel lash accelerator from
the drugstore so that is our completed I
look and now to finish this off we will
move to the face I'm going to use a Mac
Studio care blend pressed powder in the
shade dark which is technically a face
powder but like I've said many times
before I love using face powders for
sculpting the face because I think that
they usually are the softest ones and
most blendable since they are designed
to be a full coverage foundation I
typically like those the best for
contouring so using a makeup geek blush
brush I believe this is I'm going to
just put this on the temples I'm going
to contour a little bit well then I'm
going to go in with a morphe mb5 and
just buff all this out so that it looks
more like bronze and not like whoa in
your face contour then
going to go in with Becca flower child I
wanted some pinkie cheeks and I am going
to be using the morphe what is this this
is the morphe M no g8 the morphe g8 as
my blush brush I absolutely love this
brush for blush it's like my favorite
right now for highlight I'm going to go
in with artist couture this is the
diamond glow powder and I am going to be
mixing the shade conceited and yes I
can't take myself seriously when I say
that I'm going to be mixing those two
colors and highlighting my cheekbones
I'm going to be honest this looks way
better in person the camera is picking
it up very chunky which I am not happy
about but in person these really are
very beautiful
to complete this look you can pair any
lip color you want but I did choose to
use OCC lip tar in the shade harlot and
I will put the lip liner that I matched
it with in the description box down
below so that completes this tutorial I
hope you guys enjoy I love you so much
happy holidays and I'll see you soon bye
