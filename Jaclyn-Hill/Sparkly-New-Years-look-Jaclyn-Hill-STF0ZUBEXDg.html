light under my eyebrows and this is a
really frosty light shade I'm using this
because I want to be really shimmery and
highlighted especially for a New Year's
Eve look I definitely want to be bland
and now on a flat shader brush I'm
taking the color shimmer Moss which is a
shimmery blue color and putting it all
over my lid very generously now on a
fluffy brush I'm taking soft Brown which
is totally an essential color by Mac I'm
just throwing that on back and forth
windshield wiper motions up to the brow
bone and this will help blend all those
colors out now I'm taking plumage which
is a deep blue green I'm taking out on a
stiffer brush so I can really get into
that deep lower crease in that corner
and I'm blending in and slightly up just
to blend that light brown and that
frosty blue together and just keep
looking at it take a step back until you
feel like it's even when I'm going back
with that same brush from before just to
blend it out so we don't have any harsh
lines you don't want that and just touch
up as you see accordingly you know I
want that to be pretty deep out there
that way the inner color really sparkles
and shines and gives a lot of contrasts
compared to that outer corner and just
do the same on the other eye
going back with that fluffy brush and
just blend blend blend
now I'm taking mac's fix+ which I love
I'm going to spray my brush and dip it
into Mac's loose glitter and then I'm
going to tap that with that same brush
in that inner corner and now it's pretty
wet right now which is good and you can
get that nice and wet and then you can
go back with your brush a second time
and then it'll really pack on that
glitter and you want to put the most
glitter in the inner corner to really
make your eyes pop and this will be
really pretty when you look down
now I've applied eyeliner I'm going to
throw on a pair of false eyelashes to
give a really intense more dramatic look
because I feel like that's what New
Year's Eve is all about you can do it
ever you want with makeup I'm taking a
really light powder and I'm putting it
in a v-shape right underneath of my eyes
to give more of an intense highlight
smudging that cream on my outer corner
bringing it a little bit more than
halfway in just rub it along that line
nice and tight and then get shimmer Moss
and go ahead and throw that and your
inner tear-duct
to complete the under eye area throw in
a coat of mascara and you are good to go
I'm putting Mac's smolder pencil in my
waterline just to smoke it out even more
and this is totally optional and then
I'm using that same data light hyaline
highlighter from under my brow and
putting it on my cheekbones and then I
am putting a little bit of light pink
blush on the apples of my cheeks and
finishing off with a clear lip gloss and
I am all dying it so easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
