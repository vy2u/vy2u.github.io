jump start on spring trend tutorials I
don't know how I sense the way that just
came out but anyways I am very eager for
the spring trend to be amongst us and so
leaving Fashion Week I thought that this
was like the perfect opportunity to go
ahead and start spring trends I live in
Florida so I already feel like it's
spraying for those of you who are
braving the horrific storms and all the
snow and ice up north I feel you I was
once there with you I'm sorry it
seriously
stinks so bad so here I am bringing you
a little bit of sunshine I have been
wearing this I look for nine years of my
life which is a pretty big deal to
continuously wear the same I lived for
nine years and still like it and still
might get sick of it not to mention I
have done this look on tons of my
clients in the past and it really does
look good on all skin tones and even if
you are very fair a lot of people who
are super fair and burn easy feel like
they can't wear copper you totally can
and especially those with blue and green
eyes this is going to make your eyes so
bright and those with brown eyes it is
going to really bring out the honey in
your eyes so it's beautiful on everybody
I hope you guys enjoy this spring a huge
trend is copper eyes oranges yellows
coppers warm Browns which I love because
you usually think of autumn and fall for
that type of trend but this year it's
spring and you guys know me that is like
literally right on my alley
I am so super excited so I thought that
I would go ahead and show this with you
it's a very fresh face super easy not
even wearing any eyeliner today which is
crazy for me right so I hope that you
guys enjoyed this video I hope that you
do it yourself at home if you do don't
forget to tag me in any pictures and as
always all the information every single
detail every single question every
single product that I even mention in
this video is going to be in the
description bar below so I love you guys
so much I'll see you soon bye we are
going to start off today with the skin
so first thing I'm going to do is prime
my face using Dior glow maximize your
light boosting primer and we are going
to press this into the skin it will make
such a difference if you press your
primer into your skin as opposed to just
rubbing it across your pores then we are
going to go in with gnar
sheer glow foundation and Marc Jacobs
mixing these two together just gives me
a really nice natural luminous finish I
just that's just me I like mixing my
foundations and I am using a sigma f80
brush to apply the foundation as always
and then I'm going to go in with Tarte
Amazonian clay concealer which I don't
think I've ever even used on camera
before but I actually really like the
finish of this and I'm using it just to
lightly highlight some areas of my faces
where needed so around the lips Cupid's
bow chin nostrils where you just get
hormonal e red and as you can see this
is not a very intense highlight it's
nice and mild which I really like for a
look like this since we really do want
the skin to look nice and fresh and
youthful but we don't want it to be like
BAM highlighter or BAM contouring your
face so a little trick is just using
your concealer for the face and I do
prefer this concealer on the face as
opposed to under the eyes I find that it
creases a little bit so under the eye I
am going to use Mac Pro Longwear
concealer this one is in shade NW 20
which is a pinky beige undertone and as
you can see it looks like I'm putting a
lot on but I'm actually blending it out
and my finger will pick up a lot of the
excess and then this is the f-86 brush
by sigma and the reason I love this
brush so much is because it picks up so
much excess concealer so you really
don't get that buildup of chunky
concealer that creases underneath your
eye I just love this brush because of
that I'm also sweeping that across my
eyelid to prime for my eye shadow then
I'm going to go in with my Bobbi Brown
foundation stick to contour I will put
my contouring video down below that's
all about cream highlighter so you can
see exactly what I'm doing and how I'm
doing it but I am just using an angled
brush again by Sigma absolutely love
this brush for contouring as you can see
it just blends out so naturally so
beautifully I do pick up the product on
the brush first as opposed to drawing on
my face where the contour can be a
little too strong and intense this will
make it look much more buffed out and
natural just like you've been kissed by
the Sun then I'm going to go in with
Smashbox suntan matte bronzer with the
NARS eita brush and just hit that on
that high point of my cheekbone and just
dust it out I'm not
going to really take this or drag it all
around the face just to bring more depth
to certain areas and then using a Marc
Jacobs foundation brush don't ask I'm
obsessed with it I don't know why I
bought it and now I'm just I'm in love
this brush for buffing out my bronzer
then I am using the brow bar to go this
is by whitening lightening I have fallen
in love with this product recently so
I'm just going to use the lighter shade
to fill in the inner part of my brow and
the darker Brown to fill in the outer
part I am using an Anastasia brush I'm
not sure which one it is but I will list
it down below then using the Anastasia
contour kit I am going to go in with
this banana color right there in the
center and mix it with Mac emphasized as
always and then just lightly dust that
around the eye area I am using a sigma
tapered highlighting brush to do so and
as you can see I am just patting patting
patting you don't want to go too
generous with this highlight because
again you don't want the skin to be
really intense today you want to keep it
nice not natural natural is not the word
because this definitely isn't natural
but you understand we don't want
anything to be too intense and
in-your-face so make sure using a light
hand with all the products that you are
applying so I'm just using these
highlighting powders just to set
everything that I've done then I'm going
to go in with amber lights and copper
ring both by mac cosmetics these are the
two shadows that I have been wearing for
nine years of my life mixing them
together it's just absolutely beautiful
so I am using a sigma e25 brush just to
buff this all over my lid which is just
a white goat hair blending brush and
this is the only brush that you will
need for this look on the top of the
eyelid and because these shadows are so
creamy and smooth you don't even need
another brush or another color to buff
it out where typically you need a
transition shade and this look this is
all you need with putting no additional
products on that brush just buff upward
and it will just naturally blend itself
out just make sure you continuously go
and when she'll wiper motions then with
any pencil brush this is an old-school
pencil brush I just use it all the time
as like my tried and trued I don't even
remember what brand it's from it might
be Sedona lace just put that all
underneath your eyes from inner to outer
corner buffing it back and forth again
make sure you get even amount of product
of the gold and the copper if anything
I'd like to pick up a little bit
additional gold then with no additional
products on a blending brush I just go
back and forth just to buff that out
even more and give it a really blown out
feel then I'm using giorgio armani eyes
to kill mascara which oh my gosh I'm
falling in love with this is a sample
size and I do not want to spend that
kind of money on a mascara I'm pretty
sure I'm going to have to then I'm using
Mac Spring Sheen blush which is
absolutely gorgeous
it's the perfect peach with a little bit
of pink and I'm going to dust that on
the apple of my cheeks working backward
blending it into that bronzer toward the
temple area making big buffing circular
motions to again add to that sunkissed
glow look then I go in with the same
brush that I used to highlight and I
just kind of go over that blush area and
that's what gives you the really blown
out airbrushed look on the cheeks then
I'm using the Becca highlighter in the
shade opal which I am falling in love
with this is such a great dupe from Mac
whisper of guilt which is only comes out
like once a year in a collection and
everybody loves it and it's such a
beautiful highlighter but this one is so
close in comparison I absolutely love it
so using a sigma tapered highlighter
brush again I'm going to touch on the
high points of my face moving on and I'm
just going to coat my bottom lashes and
any mascara you want just to finish off
that I look now it is totally optional
but I'm just gonna pop on a pair of
false lashes with a look like this false
lashes can be really really pretty and
you don't need any eyeliner as long as
you get it close enough to your lash
line these are s Kito lashes I'm not
sure which style but I will list that in
the description bar with a link to it
and then using the Maybelline gel liner
this is totally optional I just wanted
to show you an easy tip just to push it
up on that top waterline this will make
your lashes look thicker fuller and
blend your natural ones with your fake
ones it's also a great tip just to make
your lashes look fuller even if you're
not wearing falsies then using the Tarte
Amazonian butter lipstick and golden
pink I'm going to also mix that with the
YSL rouge will up the number 15 using
patting motions to get my favorite lip
color for spring absolutely love then
setting everything with
Urban Decay shall make up spread setting
spray I'm going to take a shower in it
just so everything is set and then
you're all done so I hope you enjoy this
fresh face spring tutorial I love you
guys and I'll see you soon

do warm shades put this e in my blue
