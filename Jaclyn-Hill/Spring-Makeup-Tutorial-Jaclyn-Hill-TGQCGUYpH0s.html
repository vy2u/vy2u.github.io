showing you this very spring fresh fun
colorful eye makeup tutorial that was
really long introduction oh I actually
have filmed this video now for the
second time I'm pissed
so four days ago I got my new camera in
the mail and I was like yes and I filmed
this exact same video in the exact same
spot the exact same thing and then I
took my son sim card out and went to put
in my computer and it just wouldn't work
nothing worked
the camera just didn't work I'm so upset
so now I have to set it back and get a
new one so I'm still using my old camera
that needs to be replaced so um so upset
it's gonna be okay these colors are
gonna look good on and literally every
single person's eye colors especially
brown eyes Oh hazel eyes yes my eyes is
actually the one shade that isn't going
to look the best with this color which
you can still see that it works it's
just not like I feel like it kind of
drowns out my eyes a little bit but it
still works because I have the warmer
shades up here with the cooler shade
down here so if it was a blue tear and
up here it would totally draw my eyes
out but it works because of the
complementary colors that we're using
together so yeah I really hope you enjoy
this look and I will season ma bye first
thing I'm doing is taking Mac's
painterly paint-pot you can use any
eyeshadow primer of your choice Urban
Decay primer potion is a great one I
also use concealer from time to time
anything just to cover up the base of
your eye and this will help your look
your eyeshadow stay all day be very easy
to blend out and it won't crease then
I'm taking Mac's goldenrod eyeshadow
this is a very yellow eyeshadow I've had
a lot of people requests asking how to
wear yellow in a normal daily basis and
I want to say this is normal day but
this is definitely a way to wear yellow
where it's not like oh my god you're
wearing yellow but this shadow has um a
little bit of shimmer in it but it's not
frosty and I'm taking just a synthetic
blending brush which this is the Sigma
version of the Mac 224 I will go into
lots of depth in my next video
brushes and I'm just taking this
concentrate on the outer corner of the
lid and blending this color up towards
the brow area I don't want to cover the
lid area by the lash line I want to
leave that inner corner bare and just
basically blend this from the outer
edges just kind of smoking it up and
outwards I can just like kind of blew up
but I don't want to put it pack on the
lid then i'm taking maybelline eye
studio this is their gel liner and this
is in the shade blackest black i'm just
going to take a liner brush do a thin
line normally on the lid and then i'm
going to just take this and extend it so
that i have a wing on the edge this is
what really pulls this look together i
think you can do this without a winged
liner and just put the turquoise
underneath but i think that the wing tip
really changes this look and gives it
something a little bit more spunky so i
just go ahead i grab that outer tail
like you saw i fill it in now i'm going
in and i just kind of trace in you know
just going around the lines and then i
extend it a little bit just to make it
just a little extra pointy at the very
tip and then you see how we have that
liner if you want to see more in-depth I
do have a liner video now I'm going to
take brown script I'm going to take this
color that I absolutely love as you can
tell because I have hit the pan on a
little stiff brush and I'm going to just
touch it to my liner in that crease and
then bring it up I'm not going to blend
this out too much this isn't really a
cut crease I'm a cut crease is much more
precise in this but this is kind of a
softer version of a cut crease where I
just want to put this color in that
crease area blend it out just a tiny
tiny bit and then leave it alone so you
can see that I dug this right in that
liner right in that crease of my eye
um this is different for me doing
yellows and like Reds together because
it kind of looks like fire and I don't
really like those shades together mix on
my eye but I love love love the way it
complements the turquoise at the bottom
and pulls it all together anyways moving
on I'm using l'oreal true match
foundation it's actually L'Oreal True
Match Lumi I'm using it in shade w5 with
my Sigma f80 kabuki brush to apply my
foundation don't mind the goofy faces
that I make when I apply foundation I
don't know why I feel like I need to
look like a monkey when I do this but
you can see it's a shade darker than my
skin but it is what it is I've gotten so
fair recently I don't know what to do
about it just waiting for you know the
spring to come around and then I can get
a little more color so I'm using the
Betty Youth the Betty blender the beauty
blender this is just the original pink
one and they have it in tons more colors
now that's besides the point I'm using
Mac's Pro Longwear concealer in shade
and w20 is always it's funny because
it's starting to actually be the same
color as my skin tone and not really
like have all that brightening effect
because I'm getting so light but it is
what it is
blending that out all over the place if
you want me to go in depth about the
beauty blender and why I love it so much
I can do so just let me know so then I'm
going to take the Mac to 1/2 or 212
brush and I'm going in with the
eyeshadow cork and I'm gonna fill in my
brows I usually always start on the
outer tail of the brow and then I bring
it forward always keeping it underneath
and then I kind of go up with this brush
as you see me doing just kind of drawing
in like sparse hairs I don't like to
fill in the whole inner corner of my
brow and like round out or square it out
because I think that it makes me look
very mean and I normally don't do that
too many people um but you know there
are different circumstances of course
and then I go up on top and I round it
out I just follow the natural hairs
I don't really create any fake hairs on
myself but I am doing a very bold brow
today so anyways next I'm going to take
this map Pro under-eye highlighter and
emphasize this is a starch white shade
with a little bit of shimmer in it which
seems weird because for the under eye
area but I really really love it
right now in Mac foundation I am like an
NC 25 maybe even an NC 20 at this point
I'm so light but I wouldn't use this if
you're any darker than an MC 30 to 35
once I get to a 30 I mix it with other
powders because it is very very light
anyway so next I'm taking matte shimmer
Moss this is a very turquoise shimmery
beautiful turquoise shade I'd loved it
so much I used it in a video one of my
first videos ever from a long time ago
so anyways I'm just going to take that
same shaped brush as a Mac two and two I
don't
the name of all the Sigma brushes that I
use so I always just referred them to
them as the macro numbers which I
shouldn't do I should really get like a
list and memorize them and need to take
some time to do that but anyways I'm
just taking this and I'm using this
because I need something a little bit
stiff that can draw a straight line
because I'm following the outer tail of
that liner just perfectly right
underneath I'm just spreading this out
all over the lid and just pushing it
into that lash line I really want to
make sure I bring it all the way to the
inner corner all the way to the outer
tail if you can see I got a little bit
of concealer on my outer um wing right
there on my liner but that's okay
because you can take just your old brush
with some liner leftover on it and just
go over it and touch it right up so same
with if you get this turquoise all over
your liner it's no big deal you can fix
that no problem then I'm just going to
take a pencil brush and just blend all
of that out all over the place from the
inner corner all the way out to the
outer part of my eye you can just blend
it however you see fit pretty messy but
then on that outer tail of the liner I
don't really want to blend that that
much I want that to stay nice and sharp
then I'm taking Mac's fresh water fresh
water again is a very very shimmery
shade and I'm going to take this and
just pop it specifically right
underneath my eyeball but if you're
looking straight forward into the mirror
I just want to put it directly
underneath where my eye is sitting this
is just gonna give an extra little pop I
didn't want to just do a one dimension
turquoise because you wouldn't think
that I have two colors on when you're
looking at the pictures but it just it
gives a little bit more of a pop and
it's more 3-dimensional I just I love it
so then I'm taking red cherry lashes in
number 43 of course and just popping
those on I always use tweezers to get
them on I should do how to apply false
lashes video because everyone's always
asking me how and why I use tweezers
then I'm taking Mac's mineralize
skinfinish and medium deep it looks
really really light in the camera but
you can see as I'm putting it on it is a
bronze color I use this just because I
think it looks very natural it's not too
matte not chalky it's not too red it's
not too orange I just love this shade
right now and I'm using any big brush
that you have will do this one is my
personal
favourite of the moment for this I
hadn't really been specifically
contouring my face recently especially
for this time of year I really just like
the kind of blown out bronzer look as
opposed to really defined contour
sculpted cheekbones it's just my
personal thing right now but I'm just
going all around the outer corners of
face down by the jawbone you know
then I'm taking Mac's spring shine blush
oh love love love this color it's very
similar to NARS orgasm it's a peachy
with a little bit of an orange II little
bit of a pink a little bit of a goal
it's got everything and I'm going to
take a 1:29 brush from Mac and just
stipple this all over the cheek area I
start right underneath my eye area and
then I kind of hold the brush sideways
and I go up to the sides of my face and
I blend it all out with the bronzer boom
done so then I'm going to take mary lou
manizer by the balm this is one of my
favorite favorite highlighters of all
time it's absolutely beautiful
and I'm just going to pop this right
underneath that eye area on the top of
that blush just to pull this all
together very spring very highlighted
then I'm taking Mac's shroom my favorite
all-time color to highlight under the
brow bone and inner corners of the eye
pop that on and then I'm going to finish
off with Mac angel lipstick the lipstick
that Kim Kardashian has made oh so
famous after that you have your
completed spring fresh time look I hope
you enjoy I love you and I'll see you
soon
