makeup tutorial for you and can we
please please to stop it
take them away from my back crowd I'm
sorry I just need a minute
if you guys know me at all you know I'm
obsessed with glitter I'm obsessive
wearing glitter looking at glitter
whether it's an address whether it's
makeup my whole entire house is
decorated in like whites in Silver's and
accents of glitter eye glitter and I
wanted to have a glitter background
since before I even started YouTube but
I just have kind of put it off because I
felt like it was gonna be like too
difficult to take away from like the
personable aspect or just whatever it
may be or like I felt like a lot of
girls were doing a glitter background at
one point so I don't know I've just put
it off for a long time but I found a
bunch of different ones on Amazon and I
was like yes please
two day shipping and so I thought I
would give it a whirl and a few minutes
you're gonna see this backgrounds gonna
disappear I'm gonna be doing my makeup
with my normal background but honestly
guys let's just get real this background
is not as amazing as it seems it's being
held up by two lamps and it's about to
follow me at any second just letting you
know but let me know how you feel about
this glitter background if you just like
it in the intros maybe you would like an
entire video with a glitter background
every once in a while let me know
because I am very big and like obsessed
with my backgrounds and I want it to be
aesthetically pleasing and I want to be
something that you guys enjoy looking at
so I always like hearing your opinions
on my background so let me know how you
feel but please do not hate on the
glitter because I would really hurt me
last night I destroyed my thumb I'm not
gonna get into it because it's absolute
disgusting but long story short I picked
up a huge serrated knife to open up a
UPS box and instead of going to the box
it went right to my thumb and just oh my
god it was so disgusting
so today's makeup tutorial was
definitely a challenge for me not being
able to use this damn thumb because it
hurts so bad let me just say applying
lashes was a whole new level of
difficult not being able to use this bad
boy so if you're wondering what this
ugly bandages that is the current
situation at hand no pun intended
today's makeup tutorial was actually the
exact same look that I wore in my best
of beauty video back in January I know
that's so random but when I posted a
picture on Instagram it was like the
most requested tutorial I
ever seen from you guys and you have
continuously requested this video on a
daily basis so of course I had to do it
and I hope that you guys enjoy I
absolutely love this look so much I hope
that you love it as much as me if you do
give it a big buzz alright I love you
guys thank you so much for watching I
hope you enjoy and I'll see you soon bye
guys
well hello my love's I have missed you
so the first thing we are going to do
today is prime our skin I am using the
Smashbox primer water I'm over half done
with this bottle I love it so much and
then I'm going to go in with a second
primer that's right this is the makeup
forever primer and this is the smoothing
one I do have all of them and I'm trying
them out one at a time this smoothing
one really really smooths out my pores
filled everything in but it also made me
very matte I personally am NOT crazy
about being matte but I would definitely
recommend it to those of you who want
that matte look because my oh my this
made it happen then I'm going to go in
with the Dior nude air serum foundation
and I'm going to mix it with the Kevin
Kwan liquid highlighter oh my gosh you
guys these two are a match made in
heaven
I will go more in depth about them soon
but I absolutely love these too so I
just kind of make a little cocktail on
the back of my hand of both of these and
then I'm going to just stipple it on my
face using a sigma f80 flat top kabuki
brush I'm going to just press that into
the skin what I love about this duo
foundation is it truly looks like skin
and this highlighter is so beautiful it
gives such a natural radiant glow like
you can see right here I just love them
together then I'm going to conceal my
under eye area using the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer I have been using
this almost all month and I've really
been enjoying it more than anything I
love the applicator like I just love
this little like flimsy wand but it has
it makes it so easy to apply so using a
damp Beauty Blender I'm going to just
press this into the skin and blend it
outward then I'm going to set that
entire under-eye area using my under eye
setting powders same thing as always I'm
using a sigma tapered highlighting brush
to do so on the entire under eye area
and I also set the lid that way my
eyeshadow is going to go on a little bit
more smoothly so now we get to move on
to the eye area first shadow I'm going
to take is Peach Smoothie by makeup geek
and I'm going to
apply that with a sigma e40 this is not
a must for everyone but it is just a
must for me I pretty much use Peach
Smoothie in the beginning of every
single I look because it's just ideal
for my skin tone then I'm going to go in
with the Jaclyn hill favorites palette
by morphe I'm going to take this kind of
very light medium brown transition color
we're going to call it it doesn't have a
name so that's my name for it going in
with the exact same efore tea brush I'm
going to just dust that back and forth
in windshield wiper motions and I'm
going to kind of blend it upward and
outward with this brush so we have no
harsh lines then I'm going to mix these
two colors together this very dark
chocolatey Brown and then this kind of
almost like a raspberry purpley Brown
and I'm going to take an e25 from Sigma
and I'm going to start packing that in
the outer corner of my lid and then
blending that out you can put this all
over your lid if you want it doesn't
matter because for this look we are
going to go in and cover up the majority
of the lid area so you can be kind of
sloppy and kind of messy with this and
work it kind of all over the place but
the key to blending is always going back
with a bigger fluffier brush like I am
right now with that 40 and then
continuously going back and forth back
and forth back and forth with those two
brushes the bigger one and then the more
small dense one that will really make
sure that nothing is harsh then going in
with a definer brush I'm going to just
pack that brown on the lower lash line
you don't have to put this down there
you can put all purple down there
but I go in with this first and then I
am going to go in with Anastasia
iridescent purple and I'm going to pack
that very intensely on the outer corner
of the lower lash line because I really
want a purple down there just for some
fun this but you could use the Purple's
from The Jackal favorites palette but I
just wanted to use that one so it's
happening now I'm going in with the
makeup forever shadow indie - 5 5 - and
I did wet in my brush a little bit with
some mac fix+
if you don't own that you can use eye
drops it'll pretty much work the same
using a Mac 242 brush I'm going to just
pack that silver color all over the lid
once we get to the outer portion of the
lid I'm going to kind of stamp like you
see right now I have to wait for word to
dry so I'm doing a quick little dance
and then once that fix+ has dried I'm
going to go in with that same Sigma
brush and kind of blend out the edges
because I don't want it to be too harsh
or like jaggedy then I'm going to go in
with a Mac Pro this is high def SIA
on this is a very very intense blue
eyeliner it's available online and at
Mac Pro stores but it's not available at
like regular Mac stores you can use any
blue but that's what I wanted to use I
had a very difficult time with my
contour today I don't know why
everything was coming out very muddy and
very dirty so I'm kind of rushing
through this process but I am using the
Kat Von D contour kit to do this and I
did use that really intense yellow color
just to kind of highlight everything
because I thought hey if the contour
isn't working that great we're going to
highlight away and just fake it till we
make it now I'm gonna go in and just
coat my lashes with mascara because we
know that we're gonna pop on some
falsies and get ready for it just get
ready no thumb no thumb yeah is a go
girl go girl no thumb no thumb most
difficult moment of my life I mean not
really first girl problems but it was a
little difficult so now that we have our
lashes on I am going to go in with
makeup geek blushes and I'm going to mix
spellbound and head-over-heels these are
my two favorite blushes to mix together
for a nice pink cheek and I wanted to do
something pink instead of coral because
I always do coral and I've been loving
pink recently so that's what I did
taking the hourglass ambient lighting
palette I'm going to use the middle
shade and I'm also going to be using the
morphe M 501 brush to highlight the top
to the cheekbones and I will also bring
this on the center and the apple of the
cheek just for an extra pop of highlight
and glow I'm going to coat my lower
lashes with mascara as always I can't do
a makeup look without doing my lower
lashes I feel and then to finish this
look off I'm going to use the colour-pop
lippie stick in the shade cake absolute
love this color it's like a bright
corally pink it's just so beautiful for
spring finish everything off with Urban
Decay chill makeup setting spray give
yourself a quick bath in this fan
yourself off and we are good to go so
it's pretty easy I hope you guys enjoy
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys and I'll see you soon bye
you know this is on fleas lover blah
blah it's actually really good
oh can you see it yeah yes bitch this is
what I'm talking about that's the JD
thing I've ever seen
we need to get thinking around here
what can hold this up as I'm background
it you kidding you look miserable well
then what let me give you though it is
strap it now my background is so basic
it was much better when that was up are
you can I give me a wedgie
I'm trying to make your crack now
oh oh because the camera could really
see that what oh I'm sorry but this
background is too glamorous and this
bitch cost me $4.99 where'd you get it
mmm aim is on time mmm-hmm give me some
