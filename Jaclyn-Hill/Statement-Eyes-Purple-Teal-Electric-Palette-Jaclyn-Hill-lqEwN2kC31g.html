not that for discussion it was in a bun
I got a headache now it's out of a bun I
don't have time to make it pretty so
moving on I wanted to do a makeup
tutorial that it's really fun and
outside the box bold colorful where I
get to actually be creative because
typically here in my channel I work with
neutral tones and looks that a lot of
people can achieve and are very wearable
for the average woman daytime and
nighttime so I just wanted to do
something different and I picked up the
Urban Decay electric palette last week
and I just I love this it's like Rainbow
Brite and a palette you have ten shades
that are just crazy colorful and crazy
pigmented so as you can tell this is
totally perfect for the average woman
you know
lawyer doctor whoever when I first saw
this I was kind of nervous that the
colors were going to be maybe chalky or
dry or difficult to blend because those
are some common difficulties that can
come along with really colorful shadows
these are so pigmented they are so
buttery they're easy to blend I really
really like this palette I had a lot of
fun creating this look I needed to do
something really fun to like get myself
out of this neutral rut that I've been
in I know this is obviously not everyday
look this is not something that
everybody is going to be rocking but at
the same time it's a lot easier to get
away with fun eyes shadow like this in
the summer as opposed to the winter time
so don't be afraid to embrace color have
some fun I hope that you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching I love you and I'll see you
soon
but hey guys so the first thing I am
doing is priming my eyes I'm using Mac
Pro Longwear concealer in shade nw20 it
is so important to prime your eyes
especially before going in with a lot of
color like we are about to I am first
taking this silver shade in Revolt and I
am going to take a Mac 242 which is a
very flat brush this brush comes in
handy when you're working with any sort
of glitter or a pigment that might be a
little bit chunky says it's so flat it
really packs it on so I'm just pushing
that in the inner corner only and then
I'm going to go in with this shade
jilted this is a pink shade and it has a
little bit of shimmer in it and I'm
going to
use that same brush and pack it all over
the entire lid from inner corner to
outer corner I'm making sure that I'm
pushing this up in my crease you don't
want to exceed your crease but you want
to make sure that you get this pink into
that crease and create that little shape
then I'm going to go in with Mac's soft
Brown I'm going to take a sigma e25
brush and just buff soft brown back and
forth as I have mentioned before soft
Brown is such a necessary shade because
it really blends out any color as you
can see right here it is going to blend
out this pink shade and it really works
well because it has a little bit of a
pink tone in it anyways then I'm going
to go in with the shade urban this is
such a beautiful purple I'm going to
start on the mid corner and start
working this to inner and outer so it
looks like I'm covering everything up
but what this is doing is giving the
ITINs of dimension so it's not just a
purple eye it's not just a pink guy pink
guy okay moving on instead it is going
to give a lot of dimension because
you're going to have those different
layers of color I'm going to just blend
that out again with a sigma e25
and then I'm going to go in with both of
the shades gonzo and chaos I am using a
pencil brush this is the Sigma e30 this
pencil brush is ideal for packing on
color so I'm going to pack this all over
that outer corner in a v-shape and then
once I have it packed on with no
additional product on my brush I'll just
kind of move it very lightly and
windshield wiper motions in that outer
corner and that will blend it out for us
then I'm going to go in with the e30
brush from Mac Mac Sigma this is in my
all-time favorite liner brush and I am
using Maybelline gel liner and blackest
black which is my favorite gel liner of
life I'm going to create quite a long
wing because I want this wing to really
stand out I think that a dark black wing
really looks beautiful when you're
working with tons of color like this
then I'm going to clean up with a q-tip
you can use an eye cream you can use a
makeup remover a moisturizer whatever
you want and I'm just going to sharpen
up that edge now this is the trick you
go back in with that blue shade now that
you have on that liner and you're going
to pack that on and deepen it up and
you're going to extend it so that it
looks a little bit more like a cat eye
then once you have that on you just
quickly go back over your liner and make
it black again but this is full
to make sure that you have a really
pigmented eye shadow look that looks
really good with the cat eye then we're
going to go in with mary lou manizer by
the balm which is a highlight and I'm
going to put this all over my brow bone
and as you will see I'm also going to
slightly blend my shadow with this this
is just another trick that will help
blend out that area because it's easy to
get harsh lines when working with colors
like this but if you do these tricks
it'll be nice and blended then I'm going
to coat my lashes with mascara nothing
special and then go in with s Kito
lashes I'm going to use the Wallow lash
it is my favorite one buy them it's a
beautiful cat eyelash it's a very wispy
I absolutely love these so I'm going to
pop those on and you can see what a
difference it really makes to the look
then I'm going to go in with Smashbox
Studios skin 15 hour foundation I had to
smell my brush because I was like wait
what's the smell anyways I have been
loving this foundation all month long it
really holds tight onto the skin and I'm
going to just buff this out all over the
face I know doesn't match my face but it
matches my neck because my face is pale
right now then I'm gonna go in with mac
prolongwear concealer I am mixing the
shade NW 20 and NW 25 I know I know it
looks like I am packing on the concealer
here I had way too much on the back of
my hand so I threw it on my face and
then I blended it out with the Sigma F
86 brush that's why I love this brush
you really can't overdo it if you put
too much on this brush will pick up the
excess products for you it's pretty much
impossible to have a cakey under eye
area when you're using this brush boom
okay I am using the Mac prep and prime
highlighter and light boosts just to
highlight the rest of my face this will
make such a difference in the end result
and I'm just buffing it out with my
trusty F 80 from Sigma I'm going to fill
in my eyebrows but I'm not going to talk
about it long I will put my brow
tutorial down below voila
I just don't feel like you guys need to
see that every single video let's get
real so now I'm going to go in with the
shade fringe again from the electric
palette this shade is giving me life
right now I'm going to just push that on
the lower lash line really tight in
those lashes then I'm going to go back
with that same brush that I use those
blues on my outer corner and I'm just
going to buff it out I'm not putting any
additional product on it
you can if you want then I'm going to go
in with the shade freak which is that
beautiful green shade in the palette and
just put that all over the inner corner
then I'm going to take mac's fix+
and I'm going to wet any pencil brush
this is again the same pencil brush just
a different one it's the e30 from Sigma
and I'm going to go back with that
revolt silver color and I'm going to pop
this all over that inner corner and wrap
it around that inner part of my eye to
really get an extra pop to the inner
corners this just completed the look for
me I absolutely love the way this silver
looks on the inner corner it's so fun
then I'm going to just go in with Mac
chroma graphic pencil and shade nw20 and
NC 15 it's the same pencil but that's
the name of it as you can see I love the
way this looks you can go in with a
shade that's a little bit more white but
I like the more nude eyeliner it really
separates the colors and opens up the
eye so they don't get lost in all that
fun color now I'm going to set the
under-eye under-eye concealer with the
anastasia banana shade in the contour
kit using a tapered highlighting brush
from sigma going in with bobbi brown
bronzer and golden light I'm just going
to contour using my NARS eita brush I'm
just going to put this in the hollows of
my cheeks up around my temples
I do have an entire video on this I will
link it below I always have it linked
below in case you guys are curious it's
a little old but that's okay and then
once I have that place all over my face
I will then go in with the Sigma fo5 and
just buff all of that out just to make
sure we have no harsh lines
nothing's too dramatic we do want this
to be a pretty sharp contour though to
bring back shape to the face then I'm
going to go in with Kat Von D bellissima
blush I prefer to go in with a brighter
blush when I'm working with really
bright shades like this on my eye I
don't like a really pale cheek but at
the same time I don't my cheek to be
overboard so I like using something that
has a lot of color in it but really
buffing out so it's not too intense then
I'm going to go in with Mac angel and
it's almost gone this is gonna make my
fourth one that's going to run out
because I'm obsessed to say the least
it's a beautiful baby pink color and
it's
two pink and then I'm going to top it
off with OCC interlace this is such a
gorgeous nude shade and I'm just going
to put that on just so that it's not as
pink and it will give a really beautiful
nude pink effect because like I said we
don't want anything overboard since the
eyes are definitely doing the talking in
this look then we are just going to set
the masterpiece by spraying Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray all over the
face and this will help set that powder
and make it look much more natural
natural oh thank you so much for
watching I love you guys so much I hope
you enjoy this colorful makeup tutorial
