eight date night makeup look well
actually it's hair and makeup but the
hair is just like super fast super easy
at the very end of the video I wanted to
create a summertime smokey eye that is
still wearable but it has color
incorporated into it so we are not just
dealing with the basic Browns and blacks
and grays like you typically see in a
smoky eye but we are using some color
the color that I chose is going to look
great on all eye colors and all skin
tones and it is so easy to achieve and I
know I say that exact same thing the
beginning of every single video of mine
but I say that because I do truly mean
that and I know that core of fact
because when I'm creating a makeup look
I ask myself is the average woman who is
not a professional makeup artist going
to be able to achieve this look and it's
going to look good on everybody all eye
colors all skin tones and 90% of time
the answer is yes to both questions and
so I mean that when I say that in the
intro of my video I'm not just saying it
to say it I mean it so this look is easy
to achieve and it is fun to create and
it's fun to do and it's still little
Excel treat and sexy is silky but you're
incorporating some color so it's not
just that basic run-of-the-mill every
weekend smokey eye you get it you get it
I said I quickly say thank you so much
so so so much to those of you who just
out poured so much love on my last video
I was not expecting that and I was blown
away I was very nervous to upload that
video and kind of on the fence about it
like oh gosh do I do this do I not do
this and you guys who work you guys
who's amazing like you have once again
just confirmed that I truly feel like
friends with you like you're my best
friends you're my family like I love you
guys it was just it was awesome and I
say thank you I love you guys so so so
much I'm so grateful for you and that
just it made my day it made my weekend
named that weekend it's gonna make my
month it's probably going to make my
year so thank you again I hope you
enjoyed this video I love you so much
and I'll see you soon bye I'm going to
start by prepping the face I am going to
use mac fix+ this is a facial spray
infused with vitamins and minerals it's
super hydrating and it's going to really
help the foundation to adhere to the
skin then I'm going to go in with my
favorite foundation and this is Giorgio
Armani's a luminous
silk foundation this specific foundation
really looks like skin on the face it's
a beautiful luminous texture that looks
very natural I'm buffing this in
pressing into the skin using a sigma f80
flat top kabuki then I'm going to go in
with mac prolongwear concealer at this
moment I am mixing shade NW 20 and NW 25
I can't commit to the fairness of 20 but
I'm not quite at 25 and I don't want a
super intense highlight so I am mixing
at the moment I am blending this in and
out with the Sigma F 86 brush the most
amazing concealer brush of all time make
sure when you are using this concealer
to get it nice and generous on the lids
because Pro Longwear concealer does have
a technology in it to prime for
eyeshadow and it won't crease then I'm
going to go in with Mac prep and prime
highlighter in the shade light boost
this is a yellow based highlighter which
works for my skin tone they do have
three different colors so all skin tones
can find a shade that works for them
doing this step will give the face more
dimension therefore looking more natural
then I'm going to go in with Anastasia
brow Wiz and fill in my brows I'm just
going to do this very quickly on camera
because I have done this a million times
and if you want to see an extensive
detailed eyebrow tutorial I'll link it
down below
moving on to shadow we are going to go
in with Mac's soft brown as our first
shade this color is so necessary it's
not a shade that you're like oh my gosh
that's beautiful I have to have it but
it's a shade that you'll be thankful
once you own it really blends out any
color and works on every skin tone I'm
using a fat buffing blending brush and
this is from Sigma and it is the e-40
taking it from inner corner to outer
corner and the high point of the crease
then I'm going to go in with Mac star
violet this is one of my favorite
Purple's to work with because it is a
neutral purple it's not too warm and
it's not too cool so it really
complements pretty much everybody and
patting that all over the lid with an e
55 and then once we get to the crease
I'm going to go and windshield wiper
motions and really press it in there so
that we can go in and blend it out I'm
using an e30 eight brush and this is
completely clean you can add some more
soft Brown if you want to make it a
little bit more intense but my brush is
clean and I'm doing little circular
motions back and forth once you get to
the step really take your time and
blending because it would a huge
difference then going in with mary lou
manizer
by the bomb this is such a beautiful
highlighter I'm going to use a ff7 T ya
f7v concealer brush as my highlight
brush and look at the different snap
makes it pulls the brow up higher
it helps blend out that color and your
upper crease and it just gives such a
glamorous look then I'm going to take
any Kohl pencil one of my favorites is
the l'oreal smoldering eyeliner which is
from the drugstore this one i'm using
right now is the sigma eclipse it's
black and it's super creamy and i'm just
going to push it densely into that lower
upper lash line i need on the outer
corner of the eye and then with any
small blending brush i'm just going to
start buffing back and forth back and
forth and this will blend that out and
give more of a smoky appearance so as
you see that line is harsh and then i
will just push it around back and forth
really work with that product and this
will make it look a little bit smoky err
when we go in with lashes i'm going to
just coat my lashes you can totally just
do this curl your lashes and move on but
i am going to add falsies for the drama
so any mascara will do since it's going
to be covered up with lashes and then
i'm going to use the lower strike the
pose and look at how fluffy they are
these are one of my favorite lashes ever
i actually love them they are so
beautiful so fluffy and they look so
natural and they're easy to apply i'm
excited if you can't tell then i'm going
to go in with mac pro this is a
highlighting powder called emphasized
and with a sigma tapered highlighting
brush i'm going to just press this into
the skin
I prefer pressing before swiping because
pressing into the skin will really help
it look a little bit more natural and
the foundation will grab onto the powder
then we're going to go in with Mac
sketch if you don't own this I highly
highly recommend you do it is the
prettiest wine color purple and it
seriously looks good on every one I'm
going to take a flat definer brush and
put that from inner corner all the way
to outer corner then I'm going to grab
any pencil brush and just buff that out
with a little bit of soft brown on my
brush I'm using an ever so slight amount
of soft brown I typically put a lighter
shade on my blending brush just because
it will really help it blend out a lot
better and easier then I'm going to just
line my waterline with a black kohl
pencil again this is from Sigma
I really like the lower lash line to be
very smoky so I'm going to go in and
blend that out again all the way from
inner corner to outer corner a really
smoky lower lash line is really on trend
right now so I am loving this I'm going
to just pop that same mary lou manizer
by the balm and the inner corners just
really open up my eyes and bring a
little bit more attention back to them
so they don't get sunken in and look
like wrap you guys I'm going to mascara
my bottom lashes which I recommend to
all of you even if you feel like your
bottom lash they're tiny this does make
a difference then I'm going to contour
I'm using benefit hoola bronzer and
oldie but a goodie and for your surprise
I will be using an fo5 brush to contour
today instead of the NARS eita I have
been loving this I wanted to find a new
brush to contour with because NARS EDA
is always sold out so difficult to get
your hands on and I thought we got to
find something that's just as good if
not better so so far I love this the
length of this brush in the density is
impeccable then I'm going to go in with
Becca damselfly blush which is such a
beautiful pale corally pink shade so
pretty and I am using a makeup geek face
buffer brush to apply this blush and I'm
going to buff that out going backward
towards the temple then I'm going to go
in with Mac myth to finish the lips this
is a super super new color it's a little
bit too nude for my taste
so I'm going to go over it using color
your smile lip gloss and the shade coral
craze I'm going to remove the plastic
from my mirror because a lot of people
forget to remove that plastic and it's
like why doesn't my mirror work remove
that plastic then you have a mirror and
you can see what you're doing so that
completes the what I consider a perfect
nude coral lip so now that we have that
where it's going to set it with some mac
fix+ just to sandwich it make it look a
little bit more natural and very
hydrated now that we're done with the
makeup look let's move on to care
oh I am going to be using the lily hair
five LME these are thick thick thick 260
grams and 20 inches long I do have a
detailed video about Bellamy showing
exactly how to clip in the extensions I
will link that below if you're
interested but I was going to clip in
three separate pieces of hair and that
is all I need because it's so thick and
then I'll move on to curl
I am using the Bellamy 6n1 hair curler
this specific wand comes with six
different sizes so you can get big curls
small pros medium curls all different
shapes I am using the 25 millimeter and
I'm curling this away from my face
going backward I'm going to do my whole
head and then fluff it up
once my hair is completely cooled down I
am then going to brush through all of my
hair this will really make everything
look so much more natural and you won't
be able to see any difference between
the extensions and your natural hair I'm
just using some hairspray to lock it all
in and you are good to go I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you soon
