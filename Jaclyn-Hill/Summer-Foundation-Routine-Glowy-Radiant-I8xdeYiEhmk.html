hey everybody for today's video I'm
going to be doing my summertime
foundation routine I don't I don't
really know I'm calling it exactly yet
but this is like the most requested
video on my channel right now I was
actually planning on filming something
else before this but I asked you guys on
Twitter several days ago if you would
like to see my current summer go-to
foundation routine however I worded it
and that wasn't my most favorited tweets
of all time so I was like okay I would
take that as a very strong yes and get
to filming so I actually filled this
exact video yesterday
and when I sat down last night to edit
it halfway through the video all of a
sudden everything becomes very
overexposed and completely out of focus
and I do not know why but as I was
editing it I was like I was so
frustrated so I'm gonna film it again
today and do it right because I am NOT
about to upload a video that's blurry
for half the time so if I seem to be
doing this the entire time and looking
at the viewfinder it's because I'm going
to try to make sure that that does not
happen again I don't know what the heck
happened it's been a very long week I
have missed you guys it was my birthday
week I turned 26 it was such a weird
birthday was just weird like I'm so
young like 26 is still such a baby but
like for some reason this was the first
birthday I've ever had that I was just
like not feeling it I just think because
I feel like birthdays are just happening
so quick now cuz the older you get like
your perception of time like speeds up
or something I don't know it's just it's
just weird okay I'm gonna stop rambling
it's been too long and I'm gonna jump
into the video now okay so first thing
to do is prime my skin I highly
recommend priming your skin before you
go in with foundation which is crazy to
even hear those words come out of my
mouth because up until just like a year
or two ago I wasn't even a believer in
primers but they feel like the priming
world has stepped up their game and my
absolute favorite one is the Becca
backlight priming filter I have bought
this three times this is my third bottle
it has a beautiful luminosity to it it
feels like a lotion on your skin it
doesn't feel sticky or tacky or silicone
II it doesn't feel like your skin can't
breathe it just feels like a regular
moisturizer it has a beautiful
luminosity and I feel like when I apply
my foundation it really like hold on to
my foundation and I think that it makes
my foundation and my skin throughout the
day just look very glowy without looking
like greasy or too dewy it's going to
take like a pump and a half on my
fingertips and make sure that your
fingers are clean when you are applying
otherwise you can spread bacteria and
cause breakouts even though my hands are
not clean right now so for today's video
I'm going to be using the Josie Maran
foundation oh my god this foundation is
incredible
Josie Maran came in out of nowhere and
just like stole the foundation game in
my opinion every single person I have
recommended this to is in love with it
it's so crazy to me I don't know what
this like voodoo black magic is my
friend Jackie and my friend Christian
and my friend Marisa they are all very
oily all different levels of oil and
they all of this foundation I am very
dry I love this foundation my mom has
very much her skin she loves this
foundation I recommended this to my
cousin's my friends my family everyone
loves it
no matter what skin type they have it's
strange because it's like has a very
dewy finish but yet it just like stays
all day and my friends who are oily I
can't speak for this but my friends who
are oily they say that it keeps them
looking dewy all day but it doesn't let
the oil break through so they don't get
greasy looking so I can't really speak
for myself on that because I'm not oily
but that's what my oily friends say
about this foundation I'm going to be
mixing you cover FX custom enhancer
drops into my foundation today now you
might be thinking that I'm totally crazy
because I'm going to be mixing a very
intense liquid highlighter into an
already a vibrant and like radiant
foundation but I love this combination
so much I've talked about these a couple
times before they are crazy pigmented
I've never seen anything like this
they're so innovative they're so cool
they're like the most intense liquid
highlighter seen in my life and this is
actually my favorite way to wear them is
to mix them in with my foundation I
absolutely love the outcome so I'm going
to do two pumps on the back of my hand
just like that I don't even know if I'll
use all that honestly because this
foundation a little bit goes a very long
way and I'm using the shade moonlight in
the cover FX drops and I'm going to do
like a drop and I want to drop and a
half there we go I don't want to do two
drops I think that'd be too much so two
drop and a half it looks like that in
the back of my hand
and then I'm going to just mix that all
together
alright so now I'm going to take that on
my finger I'm just going to dab it on my
face just make sure that it's not stuck
in my nail or anything I start off with
a very small amount of foundation on my
face I always start like kind of towards
the center of the cheek I don't start on
the edges because I can always add more
I don't like to take it and dot all over
my face because then it can become too
much too quickly and it's kind of hard
to eliminate so I start with a little
bit and then I just continue to add and
build up so I'm going to go in with the
morphe M 439 this is been my favorite
foundation brush for quite some time it
is a synthetic kabuki brush it blends
out everything so beautifully um there
is the Sigma f80 that's a great one
that's also synthetic that's a flat top
there is the tarte kabuki brush which is
like a big fat one that one is really
nice as well but this is just always my
go-to there's something about it that I
always go back to it so just taking
another stamp I always kind of start in
the center of the face and then work
outward because I want the most coverage
to be in the center of my face so that's
where I'm initially going to put the
product and then blend everything out
from there this foundation goes such a
long way I already have like this whole
part of my face is done and look at how
much I still have but honestly you only
need one pump of this foundation to do
your entire face I'm going to assume you
guys in a little bit I'm scared of zoom
you in a lot because this is when
everything went out of focus yesterday
and gotten blurry so I'm really nervous
oh I'm going to be looking at the
viewfinder constantly okay so now I'm
going to move straight on to concealer
and I'm going to be using my favorite
one this is the Urban Decay Naked
weightless concealer I'm using the shade
medium light neutral and what I'm going
to do is paint this under my eyes I'm
going to start in the inner corner my
brush never gets this area in the inner
corner with foundation I'm going to
bring it down the sides of my nose and
I'm going to put it underneath my eye
all the way down here so I give this
entire area coverage and it all looks
even in one color not flipping it over
and using the other side of the wand I'm
going to do the exact same thing I'm
going to do a little strip down the side
on my nose totally crooked but whatever
blend that out I'm going to do a little
cross right there I'm going to give my
upper lip some coverage because my upper
lip looks so bad right now my god
and then I'm also going to put it over
that little blemish that I have right
there as you can see I did not use a
concealer that's a lot lighter than my
foundation maybe one shade lighter if
that but I still wanted to put it under
my eye and in the t-zone that way
everything looks way more even out and
balanced once I blend all the concealer
out into my foundation I'm going to be
using a damp Beauty sponge I cannot
stress enough how much everybody needs a
beauty sponge in their life it is a game
changer this one is by morphe they send
it to me months ago straight from their
lab because they know the eye and like
die hard for beauty sponges I love the
Beauty Blender the Real Techniques
sponge so they sent this to me and asked
me if I liked it and I told them yes I
loved it and it's the only one I've been
using ever since this one is pink the
ones that they sell on the website are
red but they're the exact same ones and
I have to say it's my favorite damp
sponge so far so I'm going to be
pressing into the skin as you see I'm
not going to be rubbing I am pouncing
and pressing into the skin using a
decent amount of pressure and not only
will just press the foundation into the
skin but pressing it in like this will
also picks pick up any excess product
that would be sitting on the skin if you
were to use a brush so you won't get
cake face throughout the day and you
won't have buildup make sure on your
under eye area you go back and forth if
you just go one way over and over and
over it can actually do the opposite
what you're trying to do and make your
concealer crease into your fine lines
this is like the best foundation tip in
the entire world if you're looking to
take your foundation to the next level
applying it with a synthetic brush but
then going over everything with a damp
blender is just like I swear the most
beautiful outcomes you can ever get now
the very next thing I'm going to do is
set my under eye area I have a couple of
different methods that I use to set my
under eye sometimes I will use a
translucent powder and a transit some
power that you have that you love will
work and I use a damp blender to apply
that but recently especially for
summertime I have been using my go-to
products which are Mac Pro emphasize you
can get this on mac cosmetics calm it is
like a shaking powder you can use on the
under eye or anywhere on the face of
course and it's not a map
but it's not a shimmery powder it's got
like a satin kind of glow to it and then
this one right here is the Anastacio
banana powder that is sold in her
contour kit and also individually I
think on its a4 website so I'm gonna be
using the morphe 49 this is from their
new elite collection and I'm going to be
using both of those products back and
forth like an even amount of them and
I'm going to press this into my under
eye and I make sure that I literally
press it into the skin no rubbing
allowed because by pressing it I am
ensuring I'm not going to remove any of
the concealer that I've already applied
I'm not going to move anything around
I'm just going to set what I have done
I'm also there do the same thing on my
eyelids because I do not want my eyelids
to crease because that's just like
inevitable okay so now for the next step
I'm going to set my entire face with
powder and if you guys have been here on
my channel for a while then you would
know that I am crazy picky about powder
and up until recently I haven't even
really set my face of powder on a daily
basis I'll kind of go back and forth but
because I am dry most powders tend to
make me just look kind of like chalky or
just like dusty and throughout the day
just kind of gets like I don't know just
it just does a little good it's kind of
creepy and it's just not flattering on
my dry skin but I have been absolutely
in love with this especially for the
summertime I don't know when winter
comes along if I'm going to keep using
this we'll see but especially for some
are just wanting like that radiant glow
I cannot get enough I raved about this
in my favorites video if you want to see
me talk more about it there but this is
by Lancome and it is the shade absolute
golden and this is the absolute powder
has like luminosity in it which is kind
of a strange idea to take like a
luminous powder and put it all over my
entire face but I just love the way it
looks I mean I just played with it one
day when I was sitting at my vanity and
I wasn't going anywhere so I go what's
the worst that can happen I look like a
disco ball who cares I'll wash it off
it's just makeup but I absolutely ended
up loving it and so now use all the time
so I'm going to be using the morphe e41
brush to apply this as you can see I
have a very small amount on it I do not
pack my brush whole that otherwise I
will
a good disco ball just a really small
amount and I always start at the bottom
of my face I recommend using a very big
powder brush for this like the bigger
the better because you're not going to
want to use something like small and
dense because it'll pack on way too much
and then you'll have like boom shimmer
on your face so something really big and
just a light application so I'm going to
put this on the entire outer perimeter
of my face the only areas I'm going to
kind of avoid is this area right here
where I already set my under eye and the
reason why I avoid that is because
recently I've had a lot of texture right
here I don't know why I don't know
what's happening I need to go get like
my face looked at and get a facial with
this entire area I've had some very
strange texture and I do want to put
this powder there because the more
powder that you put on and the more
shimmer and glow aprox you put on the
more attention it's going to bring to
texture so since I already set my under
eye area with a light highlighting
powder I don't want any more otherwise
I'll make my texture stand out so I'm
going to avoid that area but everything
else I'm going to cover in this powder
and each time I dip it in I make sure
that I don't have it too much on the
brush all right so now I'm going to go
back in with these two highlighting
powders right here this is just like so
unappealing this looks so messy too just
gross but whatever it's reality and I'm
going to go in with the exact same brush
I usually set my under eye area and I'm
going to put those products on my chin
my upper lip in the center of my
forehead
so my t-zone area just to bring a little
bit of a highlighted effect there over
top of the powder that we just applied
to kind of match the under eye area I'm
going to be using Makeup Forever bronzer
in the shade 25 eye or 25 won one of my
favorite bronzer formulas ever it looks
like this and it is waterproof I didn't
realize it was waterproof but it is and
to apply that I'm going to be using this
brush by more fetus's the e 2 I talked
about this in my favorites video as well
as well I absolutely love this brush for
bronzer so I'm going to apply this to
the entire outer perimeter of my face
starting on the cheek area I want
everything to be the darkest back
towards the hairline
I never apply Roger in the center of my
face and on my nose and all my cheeks if
you do that and you feel like it looks
good
that's awesome more power
to you I definitely look very splotchy
and blotchy and not cute when I do that
so I kind of just stick to the outer
perimeter of the face I'm going to go
ahead and apply some blush and highlight
these Rd Becca cosmetics split pants
featuring my baby champagne pop and then
this one is their mineral blush flower
child right here and I'm going to apply
flower child on the apples of my cheeks
I don't want to be too intense though
yes honey
oh all right and then I'm going to
highlight using champagne pop and I'm
using a fan brush by morphe this is the
m31 zero
oh hello leather mm-hmm give me some mmm
mmm some mmm I'm gonna highlight the tip
of my nose I don't know why I'm even
doing this I don't even like the way it
looks when I have at my nose but
everyone does it so I feel the pressure
it's gonna run over my cheeks with my
blush brush just so that it's not like
so highlighting that blinds you let me
just go ahead and finish off like my
eyebrows and like fix these crusty lips
real quick and I'll be right back
so I was gonna do my hair for you
because I thought like this is just
unacceptable but my sister is at the
pool right now and she's texting me to
come to the pool with her to Saturday
afternoon so I'm like why am I about to
do my hair and make it look pretty where
I'm gonna go sweat my balls off at the
pool the pool is not a pleasant
experience here in Florida in case you
were wondering it's kind of miserable I
don't know even why we go to the pool in
the summertime because you're just like
it's not a good look for anybody anyway
so that completes this video you guys I
really hope that you enjoy I had fun
making this I hope that it was as good
as yesterday's videos I feel like I'm
always better feeling something the
first time around and since I had a
refill in this I hope that it's still
you know it's like a good video for you
anyways the one tip that I want to leave
with you before ending this video is for
absolutely everybody the most universal
tip no matter if you are dry oily
combination no matter if you mature skin
and whoever you may be out there the one
tip that I would recommend to everybody
is to apply your foundation with a
synthetic haired brush whatever brush
that may be it doesn't matter a
synthetic hair brush blending it out
working in circular motions and then
pressing it into the skin with a damp
Beauty sponge I know it seems little
high-maintenance but this is where I
picked up along the way
these two together there's something
about blending out liquid foundation
with a synthetic haired brush and then
pressing it into the skin with a damp
you sponge oh my gosh I don't know what
it is but I just find that it gives the
most airbrush flawless finish to the
foundation so that's it you guys I
really want you to enjoy this video
thank you so much for watching I love
you guys and I will see you in a couple
of days bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
