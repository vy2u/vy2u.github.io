one I mean like it's not that serious
but I am so excited to be doing this
video because I mentioned to you guys on
snapchat about a month ago I would say
that I wanted to create a fall tag video
because I feel like tag videos used to
be so big on YouTube and I don't know
why I personally they've died down a
little bit and I miss it
I love how tag videos ring like the
whole community together and they get
subscribers involved and I just enjoy it
you're I'm saying that's why I love
monthly favorites video is because you
guys are telling me your favorites I'm
telling you my favorites and it just
gets us talking about fun stuff outside
of like the busyness and the real stuff
that we have to deal with in life I love
things that just are simple and fun and
girly so I wanted to create a fall tag
to really get everybody just excited
about the fall season because for me
personally and I know there's tons of
you guys out there who live in very warm
climates and you can completely
understand this I never feel the fall
spirit here in Florida because it is
always like a hugger degrees the
humidity is through the roof and so I'm
like looking at pictures of everyone
living up north wearing their cute boots
and their scarves like me so I wanted to
create something where I can talk about
my favorite things for fall and really
feel the fall spirit this is my favorite
time of year I know that I share that
same emotion with tons of people I know
that a lot of people enjoy the fall
season it's just a great time of year
because like the nights start getting
cooler and the leaves start changing
when you're up north and it's just so
nice and then you have Halloween and
Thanksgiving come up and then you go
into the holidays and you have Christmas
in the winter so I just love this time
of year so much so I wanted to embrace
it and create a time video for you guys
so I am creating the fall favorites tab
I mentioned on snapchat about a month
ago that I wanted to create a fall
tag you guys gave me tons of ideas so
thank you so much for that and it's
funny because I started tweeting about
it and then someone tweeted me back and
they're like Jacqueline I think this tag
exists and they sent me like the I heart
fall tag I think it was cold and I'm
like no apparently there is a tag many
times very similar to the one that I am
doing right now so
I thought I was being like totally
inventive and creative coming off with
this but it's been done before
apparently but this is just kind of like
my own spin you know I'm saying and I
Creed the questions and stuff like that
so yeah I'm excited so let's jump in to
the tag John actually helped me with
these questions because I was stumped
for a while I've been writing questions
in my notes work the past two or three
weeks and John helped me finish it last
night cuz I was like I just need like
one or two good ones because I was like
so he helped me with some of these so
thank you to my hubby for being a part
of the fall favorite tag so the first
question is favorite fall candle and I
absolutely had to make this question
first because I am so in love with
candles like I feel like my house is not
a home unless I have a candle burning so
that being said I could not pick what I
tried so hard when I have a top 3 for
you but I was trying so hard to pick one
today I was gonna making John smell them
and he was like I can't pick I can't
pick another me either and every fall
season these three candles are like my
bitches they are all from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
merked back the mine works anyways the
first candle is a marshmallow a fireside
oh my god this is so incredible this is
a candle I only burn in the evenings and
the night times during the fall in the
winter because to me it doesn't smell
like a daytime candle to me it smells
like a bonfire it smells like you're
roasting marshmallows it just smells
like an evening candle so I like to burn
this in the evenings in the nighttime I
honestly cannot describe the scent to
you it really does smell like you're
roasting marshmallows on the fire it's
not too sweet and it's not too masculine
it's like right in between I love it
john loves this candle the next one is
vanilla pumpkin marshmallow this one is
much sweeter than the marshmallow
fireside clearly I have a little crush
on marshmallows this one smells like you
are baking like muffins that are pumpkin
and marshmallow this one is much sweeter
and it sells smells like you're in a
bakery when you walk into your house oh
it's so good and then the last but not
least is pumpkin pie this one last year
was called heirloom pumpkin because if
you know bath and Bodyworks you know
they come out the exact same scents
every fall sometimes they'll add a few
but for the most part it's the same
sense but they rename them so last year
this was air
pumpkin this year is pumpkin pie and it
is so good I would say if you have to
get one get the pumpkin pie because it
just legit smells like pumpkin pie it
just smells straight-up like the fall
there's like no marshmallows there's no
sweetness it doesn't like a bakery it
just melted calm kanpai it is so
freaking good next question is favorite
lip color and this one I didn't even
have to think about it it is hands down
Kat Von D lip paint in the shade Lolita
did I just hit loaded top in a shade
little detail that's what I'm wearing on
my lips right now I just discovered this
maybe a month ago maybe six weeks ago or
something and I have been wearing this
so much that it's already starting to
get like gathered up and crusty around
the top I mean if you guys follow me on
snapchat you can see that I have been
wearing the heck out of this I get
tweets every single time I wear it
asking what I'm wearing on my lips and
it is always Lolita I have been wearing
this like crazy I'm not gonna swatch it
for you because what I'm wearing right
now it is just such a beautiful fall
color and I love that it's not too Brown
or too red it's right in between and
it's just so beautiful it can be worn as
a neutral if you want with a smoky eye
you can with barely any makeup at all
it's just such a gorgeous shade and Kat
Von D is actually coming out with a
Lolita number two which is really
exciting so it's gonna be like lalita's
little baby sister and I'm sure I'm
gonna love it just as much because this
shade is bob and it's always sold out
because it's so long so if you get the
chance to buy it buy it because it's
good next question is favorite fall
drink and I have mentioned before hands
down it is the salted caramel hot
chocolate from Starbucks salted caramel
hot chocolate in general is amazing but
the one from Starbucks there's something
that just like so off the chain it's so
salty and it's so caramel e that it's
just like when two become one
Oh gonna make love to yet payment do you
guys in a song cuz if you don't I don't
know if we can be friends anymore
they made a salted caramel latte I would
drink that too and decaf but they only
make a salted caramel mocha I'm not
crazy about milk bugs but I'm sure it's
bomb um but the salted caramel hot
chocolate hands down is my favorite
drink I know the pumpkin spice latte is
like everyone's jam but I I know I'm
gonna have like so many people being
like what but I honestly am NOT big I'm
coming to spice lattes I don't really
care of him that much I know it's weird
they used to have a creme brulee latte
that was like so amazing don't disturb
us and I ordered this and he handed me
this cup I was like Oh cups and the guy
was like and I was like okay thank you
so much
okay next question is favorite fall
blush this is another one that was like
oh you're too much pressure behind that
is actually won by Georgia El Monte and
I know it's really it's really expensive
I know but hear me out I bought this
last fall and I don't think I've ever
actually talked about it because I just
felt like it's so expensive I don't talk
about it I don't know about something
it's so ridiculously overpriced and make
people want to buy it so on and so forth
but I've been using this the past week
and I just I love it just as much as I
did last fall so I just want to mention
it it is in the shade 200 and it's
called
and Wragge know and Rogi know I will
link it down below in case that was I
totally messed up at 200 and Rogi know
anyways it is so freakin pigmented I'm
wearing it today
it is so pigmented that I swear this
blush if you used it every single day
would probably last you at least eight
months to a year so with that being said
like just a tiniest swatch like do I see
how lightly I like barely even touching
it and do you see the pigment on there
it is crazy with your brush I'm not
kidding this is how you would apply this
this is how I apply I literally like
this and then and that's it that's all I
use you can see all the pigment on that
brush so with that being said your money
really is going to go a long way it's
just such a beautiful kind of like burnt
warm reddish auburn it's ah it's so
beautiful and I swear I feel like I
don't own anything in my collection like
this so Giorgio Armani 200 and Rogi no I
will link it down below
again I'm probably
that name but if you're looking for an
amazing blush you don't mind spending
the money this is incredible
I have a couple other ones another blush
that I love that is much more affordable
to say the least
is by makeup geek and it is called
infatuation and this one I've seen a lot
of people actually used to contour and
bronze with I've never used that method
with this blush I just use it simply on
the apples of the cheeks but this is
such a beautiful matte kind of bronze II
warm peachy shade and again I just think
it's so beautiful in the fall this is a
shade that someone who has really fair
skin and wants to get like that bronzy
look without looking muddy or orange or
grey on the cheeks this would be a great
shade for you so that is makeup geek
infatuation I just love it I use this a
lot last fall and I've already used it
this week so it's just one of those
blushes I go back to every year I'm like
oh it can't wait to use this one because
it just feels fall appropriate but
that's just me one more blush for you
guys this is in the shade margin I can't
get it out of this right here and I
don't want to try it so I'm cracking it
that's what happens in that word I can't
say I'm only loyal to this blush in the
fall I definitely yours use this
year-round but I feel like what makes
this so fault appropriate is the
beautiful shimmer that it has in it it's
kind of a peachy bronze color and it
barely has any pink which is why it's so
desirable for the fall season
it's right there if you can see it and
if you want to have that really pretty
glowing from within highlighted look but
yet you feel like you don't want to go
overboard and actually use highlight I
would really highly suggest something
like Mac margin because it'll give you a
really glowy beautiful cheek but it will
be over the top so maybe if you feel
like you're too mature for that try
something like Mac margin blush just
dust it on the apples and I'll just give
you like a little gold shimmer as
opposed to a highlight you know what I'm
saying next question is favorite
clothing item oh this was like so easy
for me the second I thought of it I was
like um leather jackets leather jackets
are my favorite clothing item in life in
general for the fall time I'm so excited
use it finally starts to cool off and I
can finally wear them and it's like
socially acceptable because I personally
will take a leather jacket and wear it
to dinner during the summer nights
if it
95 degrees I'll take it with me and
where the restaurant cuz it's always
cold and I'm always I'm just like a
cold-blooded person I'm always freezing
leather jackets are just like my
favorite clothing piece ever I have them
in every style you can think of I have
them with fringe on them I have them
cropped I have them oversized I haven't
been black I have them in neutral camel
gray like I am too obsessed so let me
show you a few of my favorite other
jackets let me grab them real quick
I want to show you guys a few of my
favorites in case you guys are
interested in getting some good other
jackets
I have raved about this one so many
times before and Nordstrom keeps
bringing it back thank God because it is
such a good piece so this is like lie
this is by Blanc NYC you can get it like
they're savvy department I have owned
this jacket for years there's actually a
saint oh yeah there's a stain on it
right now that I need to get dry clean
that I just noticed you've seen me wear
this in tons of pictures and tons of
videos it's a really great great price
for a faux leather jacket it's super
edgy it has like these zippers that go
around the back right here the leather
looks a little bit worn it has this
stitching detail on the elbows I just
think that it looks so cool and the way
like this goes up straight on this side
with the stitching detail and then the
lapel flaps over on this side it's just
so edgy we get girly and it fits like a
dream and it kind of gives you a waist
in here because of these zippers that
cinch out it's just such a good jacket I
love it so much so again I'm hoping you
can still find it in Nordstrom because I
know it's been there for the past three
years straight it's by Blanc NYC if I
can find it I will link it down below
for you guys or if I can find it
anywhere other than Nordstrom in case
they don't have it I will go searching
and I hope put it down below for you
guys if I can find it this is one I got
from Zara love you guys have seen you
wear this a million times to reason I
love this one so much it's just because
of the gold detailing onyx I love black
and gold so much because I'm always
wearing gold jewelry
I'm sure Zara still doesn't have this
because Zara it's like grab while you
can because their stuff is gone forever
I feel um but if I can find anything on
Zara that similar to this I will link it
down below but I know that every single
fall and winter Zara comes out with some
really great leather jackets but again
if you want is are a jacket grab it
because they really fast it's happened
to me and my good friend both where
we're like we want that and we go back
to these later and it's gone
all right great this is my newest
addition to the leather family and I
really like this one because it is
cropped if you can tell on camera so it
hits like right at the hip area which I
love especially you're wearing
high-waisted jeans and a cropped leather
jacket I think it's so cute
so this leather jacket is all matte and
then it has buttons that are matte as
well so I just like how it's just
completely solid black with no silver
hardware no gold detailing just all
matte black and again this was from ASOS
so these are all the none of these are
like designer overpriced jackets these
are all fairly inexpensive and they are
also faux leather and then this one I
just got this one from Urban Outfitters
it's by the brand's silence and noise
that Rin is still at a few places other
than Urban Outfitters again I can find
this and link for you guys down below on
the inner part of the arm it does have
like a thick cloth material and then it
has this leather and I love how it folds
over this is cropped and it's shorter in
the back and then they hang lower in the
front if you can see that super cute I
love this one this one will look so cool
with a scarf draped around your neck so
those are my four top picks for leather
I will try to find all of them if I
can't find that maybe I'll find
alternatives for you guys down below if
you're even interested in leather I
personally just like that's my favorite
thing ever in the fall leather jackets
and then comes boots and booties but
leather jackets by the way let me know
if you guys like it when I show you like
fashion stuff because if you guys like
that I can try to incorporate more
fashion stuff into my videos from time
to time I know like I've done a few
little things here and there but if you
guys like it and you guys want me to try
to get you like find you like cool
pieces at good prices I can try to do
that for you um just let me know how you
feel
or if you're like no stick to makeup
I'll be like okay next question is my
favorite question of all and that is a
favorite fall movie
I own this movie on DVD VHS and on
Amazon Prime that is how committed I am
to hocus-pocus like I need it at my
disposal at all times when I was younger
I would watch this movie all year round
like it'd be February freakin
Valentine's Day and I'd be sitting there
watching with his focus but now as an
adult I only let myself watch it during
the fall season I want to keep it
special so whenever I pull out for the
first time it's always like a big moment
so yesterday I watched it for the first
time this season when I was cleaning out
my closet okay it's finally happening so
yeah this is my favorite movie hands
down I will watch this pretty much every
single day all the way until October
31st and then I will be done until next
year next question is favorite fall TV
show scandal say no more oh my god I am
so ready for scandals start like I can't
even take it and I saw the new preview
for this season and I'm like dying
inside so next Thursday I am ready I'm
having my two best friends over and we
will pour ourselves a glass of red wine
and we will watch Olivia and Fitz dope
right hopefully and by the way if you
love Olivia Pope's long-stem wine
glasses you know how like she always
eats her bowl of popcorn in her
long-stem wine glass those are sold at
Crate and Barrel just a little tip
because me my sister thought they were
so cool it was long sunglasses and so we
found it at Crate and Barrel so now
we're like hour-long step in the vehicle
glasses I have made everyone in my life
get obsessed with this show my best
friend introduced me to the show last
spring and I watched all of them on
Netflix and then of course I watched it
in the fall and ever since then like
everyone in my life I've forced them to
watch scandal so now my sister is into
it her husband isn't what my mom is into
I got Manny into it I'm like everybody's
across Michelle like if you've been seen
scandal yet watch it it will take you
out of your life it will make you forget
all your problems it is like an hour of
just pure like adrenaline and bliss it
is amazing I love scandal so I'm so
excited next Thursday I can't wait
favorite Thanksgiving food I had to put
this in because I'm such a foodie and so
I'm like oh I know everyone's that
favorite Thanksgiving food because it's
very important to me I can't face giving
as a part of fall right so my favorite
Thanksgiving food hands down is stuffing
but it has to be done right
any stuffing my mom does it right I
don't know what it is that she does with
her stuffing but it is so good and so
full of flavor and everybody it's just
like oh so I am crazy about stuffing my
whole fam and knows it I'm always the
one to take all the stuff in stuffing
leftovers and I'm like a frickin drill
sergeant I'm like how many servings have
you had because you only get one like
that that's not don't just think that
you can eat all you want like that's
nothing belongs to me like I'm like
crazy last question on here is your
favorite Halloween costume that you have
ever been so this is not just your
favorite Halloween costume in general
but your favorite Halloween costume that
you have dressed up as in the past and
my favorite Halloween costume that I've
ever been was when me and John were
first married so this was six years ago
oh my gosh I dressed up as John so it
was so random but John dress up as the
Joker and I dressed up as John like we
even drew like the little tattoos that
he had on my arm and I wore his clothes
I was like his boxers hanging out I
dressed up as him wore a baseball cap
and we took our nieces trick-or-treating
so that was my favorite costume just
because everyone who saw me was just
like oh my god you're John like it was
just so silly and goofy even though
they're like wasn't much effort put into
it it was just a fun time and it was a
good conversation piece so that was
definitely my favorite Halloween costume
for sure so that completes the fall
