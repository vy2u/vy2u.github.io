start I feel like I'm dreaming you that
literally had so many dreams good ones
and nightmares about vehicle Muniz exact
video so I just I can't believe I'm
sitting here right now I have been
thinking about what I'm going to say in
this video for literally over a year
like I like to take baths with once a
week I'll take like a bubble bath when I
sit my bubble bath I always think about
this video like what I'm going to say
and how I'm going to convey to you like
the passion and the heart that went into
this project and now that I'm actually
sitting here on camera and actually time
to record I'm just like I just feel like
it's like crickets like I have actually
no idea what is there I would feel so
overwhelmed with excitement so bear with
me okay I'm going to try to do this the
best of my ability so for today's video
we are finally going to be talking about
my palette I created in collaboration
with morphe it is called the Jaclyn hill
palette which just sounds so weird for
me to say but I call it my pal I said
that one else was weird the jack on the
hill mallet it seems so like official we
actually when we first started
collaborating on this we actually wanted
to name it something different like we
wanted to name it like the master
palette or we want to name it
Jacqueline's life palette or and then we
also wanted to do Jackson's dream
palette and we were like I sound too
much like Barbie's dream house
so we settle on just calling it the
Jaclyn hill palette and you can see here
the packaging is all white and silver
because morphe really wanted me and like
my personality and my persona to reflect
and come through in the packaging and I
am all about white and silver and bling
that is just who I am to the core I feel
like if you cut me open like silver
glitter would pop out and then you can
also see on the back there and with red
hair because these photos were taken
months ago and yes I'm missing a nail I
want to talk about it okay I got really
upset elevators all of this videos I
missed a fingernail but what's funny is
that I actually this is the original box
art that we had some forever ago the
font is different I'm pretty sure coming
the verbage is different you can see my
hair color so different it's two years
ago like I look completely different
then the front of the boss is way more
basic right here like you can see my
signature like it's not metallic the
cardboard isn't I'm great like this is
where we started but we decided to kind
of like step it up a little bit and
Linda
like no I think these photos I love them
but like let's remake them like more
updated so we did that's what you have
right here and the images are now glossy
and I have red hair which you can see
how long ago these were taken because my
hair is dark now I had red hair in like
seven months or so but these were taken
a while ago that's the picture on this
box those these were taken like two
years ago or so and I loved it morphine
I named our in like this metallic mirror
I don't know it's just a little thing
that really got me excited so I really
want to give you guys like the story of
this palette and how it came to be and
just why it took two years to develop
because I know that's absolutely insane
but it's really important to me that you
guys know like what this process was
like for me because it just makes this
palette so special to me you can see why
I'm so excited so a lot of you guys will
remember about two and a half years ago
I collaborated morphe for the first time
on a favorite eyeshadow palette so I
picked out my favorite morphe eyeshadows
they put in a palette and then put it on
sale and it was a really great success
made a lot of fun doing it and
immediately after that launched Linda
came to me and was like hey that was
awesome you know if the phone won't stop
ringing the emails are going crazy and
people would love to see something else
with us would you be open to doing like
another favorite color would you be open
just doing something like Jaclyn hill
and morphe x to something else and i was
like you know like basically i love you
so much I'm flattered thanks but no
thanks type of thing you know but I
don't want to be a dead horse I don't
want to turn something that's been
positive into a negative like let's just
let it be she was like okay like I
totally understand I am willing to like
listen to any ideas if you ever want to
collaborate with us again and work
together like much my ears are open my
doors open I'm here and I was just like
I looked right at her and I was like
wait a second what if we do something
completely different completely custom
but you have to give me creative control
like you have to let me come up with my
own colors in my own shade that what
would you think about doing something
completely different like 35 shades
created by me with new textures new
finishes new blend ability but we can
keep it affordable because more if you
knows how to do affordability and she
was like freaking love this like this is
incredible this is a great idea so we
got really excited she flew down to
Florida I'm going to forget we sat on my
couch literally for 48 hours I'm not
joking we both slept on my couch
that night woke up and got right back at
it we went to Starbucks we got muffins
we got bagels you got coffee we came
back and we just kept going for 48 hours
we sat there we with the Home Depot we
went to Lowe's about paint chips Pantone
books we staffed where we would do all
different color samples all different
paint chips just picking out what it was
the I one of my palettes would look like
I thought I described to her you know I
want this type of shimmer this type of
matte like I was it was so much fun just
sitting there in first creating these
colors and we started off with over 100
colors because that is just like I'm a
dreamer and I wanted this palette he's
so amazing on my crab we had like a
hundred and eight colors or something
I'm like I want all of them what I don't
know what to do I don't know what to do
sitting there with all these paint chips
and after several weeks we got down to
the 35 shapes and so once you're done in
35 shades were like oh my god this is
how it's going to look like you know we
start getting an idea well then from
that point we were working with the lab
so I was getting lab samples every
single week and you guys I can't even
begin to tell you how many samples I
went through there's one shade in this
palette and the name of it is obsessed
and I went through over 25 samples about
one color that one color and that's why
I mean to obsess because I'm obsessed
with it and it's bark right now like I
love it the perfect color for all of the
liver smokey eye finally about nine
months into working on this we had our
palette and I'm like the shades are
perfect like we're good it's amazing and
it was time to go into production it was
time to launch it and I was like Linda
you're gonna kill me I'm so sorry if I
hate this it's not right she was like
wait what okay it's not right I know
we've been working on this for nine
months that's a long time but it's not
right and so I went back in I removed
nine shades twenty uses at nine months
and nine shades I removed nine shades
and I completely started over with it
was nine shape so this palette was
actually starting my dog from there
making noise this palette was supposed
to launch actually laughs holiday so
long ago but I just I got so picky and I
just wanted to make changes and I was
like it's just not perfect I was like
yes it's a beautiful palette but it's
not perfect and she didn't question me
she threw her hands up and she said I
trust your process and she just said
that to me literally every week for the
past two years I've heard them tell me I
trust your process you know what you're
doing when it comes to color I trust
your process
I trust your process and I am so just
beyond thankful and grateful for Linda
having so much faith in me I'm just so
thankful that she was next to me the
whole time you know and it's like her
the owner of the company was on the
phone with me and base tightening
applying to Florida all the time to work
on this guy right here so we are very
excited to launch this to say the least
okay I'm going to go ahead and open up
this palette that you guys you will see
exactly what it looks like when you
receive it if you do choose to purchase
it comes in bubble wrap so that stays
protected of course so it will see exact
same on the actual palette as it does on
the box and the back of it has more feed
times Jaclyn hill and then it has my
initials
all over the back which looked at
surprising with that which I thought was
super cute and then on the inside there
is a clear plastic thing to protect the
shadows which is what flying out across
the room that's fine oh sorry I'm so
excited to actually open this up on
camera for the first time hold on I in a
minute whoa I was not expecting to get
that excited huh okay
hmm okay this is do it one more time
okay
so on the inside of the palette we have
this nice pale kind of shiny gray and it
said this palette is dedicated to all of
my loving subscribers and that has my
signature right there again which was
very important to me that this was on
the inside the palette we had solely
different options of things to put there
and I really wanted to put there is
every single day I want you guys to open
this up and just remember how much
you've done for me my life oh my god
gonna good oh okay I can do it together
okay
whoo-hoo you know I am unable to hug
every single one of you and me every
single one of you and thank you in
person for does everything that you've
done for me the way I wish I could but
this is my gift to you guys one of my
gift to you guys and that is why I
teamed up with more fee because more fee
is the only brand that trusted me this
much it was actually able to allow me to
create
35 of my favorite colors my dream
palette was the most beautiful finish
and blend ability for such an incredible
price point they were the only brand and
I think you guys can see why I teamed up
with them and like when it comes to that
because I wanted to be able to give
something to you guys that is incredible
for a great price
so this palette is $38 for 35 shapes and
it is more expensive than their typical
palettes that you find online they're in
the plastic packaging but there's a lot
of reasons behind the difference in the
price increase which has to do with the
colorants that we use is all branding
machines so one of the things that makes
this palette so unique is that every
single shade and this palette was
prepped differently which is a really
big deal because you don't hear that
very often and it's very time-consuming
and tedious and one of the things makes
they've made this palette take so long
and when I first started I have seen no
idea what that meant I'm like pressing
differently pressure like what does that
even mean
but basically the way a shadow is
pressed is what determines its color
payoff and its pigmentation so I went
through every single color and went back
and forth was the last like note this
needs to be press more notes it needs to
be pressed less I personally think that
they are at their absolute max of
perfection like they couldn't get better
the way they were pressed on top of that
morphe also use brand-new machines to
create this palette and also introduced
a new grinding process to make the matte
shades even premier which they basically
had to explain to me that the grinding
processes be grind down like the matte
pigmentation and basically the machines
work like double as hard as a typical
matte because we wanted to make it
really extra creamy so along with like
each shaving press differently in the
grinding process that they're using for
this palette it is taking a long time to
create them much longer that it
typically takes any palette to be
created because it's so specific because
a lot of palettes out there in the world
the majority of them all the shimmers in
all the masks are press the exact same
when you know how it's sometimes there's
inconsistency that is a lot of times
because they're just pressing the same
which is very standard but I like to
press them different I wanted each shade
to feel like its absolute best which I
tried my hardest one of the things that
makes this palette so special to me is
that they're the color in here for
absolutely
everybody and that is why I wanted to
dedicate to my subscribers these my
subscribers are all different people
from all different walks of life may you
be younger older boy girl man woman
light dark it doesn't matter there's
something in this pallet for you and I
really took the time to make sure of
that I test it out these colors on
different skin tones to make sure that
it's not just going to work on someone
with my skin tone and that's it I want
everyone to be excited because what I
have wanted from the very beginning is
to create a palette with 35 shades that
not only can just the everyday woman use
it but also the most experienced artist
I want this palette to be able to go
from someone's home to backstage like I
want it to be able to be everywhere and
there's something in it for everyone out
there and that is a reason why it took
two years to develop because I was very
very hard on myself and had so many
people's opinions I was asking so many
different people at what do you think
could this one shade be better waiting
do you think that purple grab a little
bit more with a pink undertone I felt
like I was crazy because I just wanted
to be perfect and I just loved it
so I would will not just watch it now
that Victor Italy has covered the
majority of the palette I want to show
you guys like without plugging the
camera like how creamy these colors are
like if I just barely
rub my finger in it what you guys can
actually be able to tell like without me
more lift with this oh my god just be
able to see without me cutting the
camera how crazy pigmented these shadows
are like is that not absolutely gorgeous
I love okay this I have never watched
thirty five colors before so I think
we're going to take it by rows going
like swatch one roll my arm and then
swatch the second the third the fourth
in the fifth row I think it's right
there dude yeah okay okay the first
shade in the palette is called in light
and this is a satin formula so beautiful
on the brow bone and inner corners what
I'm wearing on my brow bone in my inner
corner right now I'm also wearing on my
cheeks as well the neutral undertones
going to work on a lot of different skin
tones next we have the shade beam which
is a little bit more frosty and a little
bit more of a yellow undertone I wanted
to put that in there because when I was
doing makeup like professionally on tons
of different skin tones I always wanted
to have a new
highlight for the brow bone and I only
going to have them with a little bit
more unlike yellowy undertone for just
so certain like really tan with a bronze
skin types that don't skin tone sorry
that just don't work with that neutral
highlight they need a little bit of a
yellow undertone this is for you oh my
gosh this next color feels like butter
when you touch it this is a shade silk
cream oh that's what I use every single
day in my transition right here
the Spurs Carla I ever put on my eyes
when doing my makeup for the past year
and a half is silk cream third shade in
the palette fourth shade in the palette
is similar but a totally different
undertone and this is in the shade and
SEO and I named it that because pins are
made for each other when I was a little
girl I watch Sleepless in Seattle and
there's that scene where she's like an
SEO made for each other and I thought
she was just so cool and I love this
color and I feel like they're made for
each other so if I named it next through
the shade faint and this is the first
shimmer in the palette because as you
can see these are satin and these start
to get really shimmery a little tiny bit
goes a very very long way like it's very
intense very metallic just high beam all
the way now we have the shade sissy and
I named it that because this is my
sister of X avorite color to wherever
and this is the first and duochrome in
the palette so it's 50% and gold
zookeeper spent pink which is like a
beautiful rosy gold I love it and I need
after my sister so last one in the top
row is the shade little lady and I'm a
different lady because I think is just
such a great color for just day to day
like you can wear this all over your lid
going to the office whatever age you may
be it's going to work so I thought
little lady was just the perfect name
for it so there is the top row for you
the first seven shades in the palette I
can't throw my hair up really quickly
because I'm just getting it away of my
splashing she's a let's jump on to the
second row the first one is the shade
creamsicle I don't hope you guys can see
me talking on camera this is creamsicle
and this is a creamy creamy pigmented
matte right here oh pretty its main
creamsicle for very obvious reason you
guys
no I can't live without a mustard yellow
like this like I just love it so much
next we have the shade butter and I
named it butter for obvious reasons
because I just love that buttery creamy
matte it does have a oranjee undertone
in it
so gray next we have the shade cooter I
love the day with it so much it's an
ongoing like is this family joke we call
like whenever like someone is be nice
and like whiny we refer to them as a
cooter so I just wanted to like bring
that family inside joke into the pallet
I thought that was the perfect shade for
it next we have you know is one of my
favorite color in the palette
come on going to play games this is the
shade
pukey yes I literally named a color
pukey in the palette because it's a baby
pukey brown and i had subway subscribers
tell me if you ever come out with a baby
pukey brown and you don't name a baby
puke i'm going to hate you forever so I
did name it
pukey this next shade might be my
favorite one in the entire palette oh my
god look at the pigmentation on this mat
you guys it is so freaking it creamy
like I just love touching it it feels so
good look at that color
come on oh so this color is named hunt
and the reason why is because that is my
nickname for Linda that is what Linda
and I call each other and I named this
color after her because this color would
not have been possible if it wasn't for
her I could not get it right she knew
exactly what I wanted I could not figure
it out she went to the lab she handled
it in person sent me the sample and I
was like you are boss I told her I said
this colors movie named after you so I
named a hunt because that's what we call
each other so every time you try to
color on make sure to thank Linda from
morphe from making my dream come true
because literally it would not be in
here if it wasn't for her I was about to
pull the color out of the palette and
she just came in and slave a day next we
have the shade firework for obvious
reasons because it is a gorgeous just
hot red kind of orange coppery undertone
and this is a shimmer so pigmented so
beautiful last one on the second row is
a foiled shadow and this is a pure gold
in the shade
mean tell me that that row does not just
do things to you because it does things
to me and there is a closer look at the
second row gosh first shade in the third
row is obsessed and this is the color
that took me the longest it took me over
25 submissions from the lab to get this
color perfect and when I nailed it I
just like I wanted to cry honestly
because it is just the perfect allover
lid color for a smoky eye if you ask me
I mean it'd better be perfect
damn I worked hard enough on it next we
have the shade SBN which is another
shimmer and SBN is what i named it and
it stands for smokey but natural and the
reason why I named it is because inside
joke with a lot of makeup artists and me
and my friend Jackie especially we're
always laughing about smokey by natural
because when you're working artist it's
like every bride and like just the
majority of women when they sit down in
the chair you're like okay so tell me
what you want today and they're like
well I want to look smoky but I want to
be natural like I want smoky but natural
and it doesn't make anything but yet I
still understand exactly what everyone
means they want something smoky but
natural like I totally understand and so
this is like that perfect allover lid
color when someone wants a smoky but
natural look so I named it Sdn this next
one right here is a cream shimmer so you
will see is crazy crazy creamy I mean
can you see how insanely like treatments
is and when you feel it it almost feels
like there is water in it like it is so
so so creamy it like almost feels wet
and this is in a shade pill stir and I
named this after you guys because this
is like one of my favorite colors for
all over the lid it's a such a deep dark
burnt copper it's so so beautiful it's a
little coarse on green eyes blue eyes
brown eyes it's just it's such a
gorgeous shade I wanted to name that
after just my rider guys the ones who
are there no matter what it wants to get
me to let you know me this is our color
and actually in a palette is a map and
this is in the shade
I named it Roxanne because that is my
middle name in case you guys didn't know
my name is Jeff and Roxanne and this one
right here is a very very pigmented very
creamy just perfect like dark burnt red
I love it it is like my favorite color
like I just love like those deep matte
burnt red oranges and copper so I named
that one after myself even though that
seems kind of narcissistic okay and then
next we have another matte and this is
in the shade
Jax and it's J a cz that's what my
family called me so John has always
called me it's just kind of like an
inside thing like my family's to call me
Applejack and that's what I originally
wanted to call this but I didn't want to
call it Applejack and get in trouble
with like Kellogg's like with actually
Applejack
so I named it Jack J a cz because I love
this color so much God to me I talk
about how beautiful Israel is like are
you kidding me this next color is kind
of a funny story because Linda is
actually the one who requested this
color be in the palette and at first I
was like no I'm not putting in a palette
and I had something else in its place
and then she's like come on but it and I
was like no no no no I refuse to put it
in and then when I was in LA like a
while back there was one color missing
issues I just put the color in the damn
palette and all my side gromek it's the
only color I don't like in the whole
palette by having your way think it'll
be like my mark that's my color I've
it's fine
it's your color then when I was there
last time I was like Linda you're gonna
die when I tell you what color I use
every single day and she was like shut
up and I was like I use bun every day so
she named it buzz I told her like you
have to be the one to name this color
because it is so you and your shade it's
really it's honestly when I first
thought might get it so basic because
it's just like I don't know it's like
very neutral style it's got some warmth
in it but it's not like super fudgy but
it's also not much super red super warm
super orange like it's just definitely
work of there neutral which at first
turned me off but now I use it literally
every day I use it like on a nap
on a smoky day I used today I use it
every day I put my favorite colors in
the palette now so thanks to Linda for
forcing you to put this color in the
palette last color in the third row is
cranapple which is this gorgeous
cranberry shade it is a shimmer that you
see right there and there you have the
third row first color in the fourth row
is the shade o royalty and it is a
shimmer purple press was a glitter in it
so you will see when you look at there's
a little tiny flecks of silver glitter
they don't actually look silver though
it's just like it just adds a little bit
of shine because it's not too much
glitter it's just a tiny bit that was
pressed with it but it will not fall out
on your face like it's not the kind of
glitter is going to be loose and fall
out and be chunky like it stays inside
of that creamy shimmer it's not going
anywhere
this purple dough was a bitch let me
just tell you it took me a long time to
get this purple right because I really
wanted just like a true badass purple
like nothing is going to be too pink to
red to blue to put a perfect purple that
everyone considered purple oh my god
this next color you guys I'm so obsessed
okay this is the shade twerk and this is
like ah so yummy like can we talk about
the fact that it is like two different
colors in one the fact it actually kind
of have it some of this exact same
purple in it it's like I don't want to
call it blue and I don't want to call it
purple and I don't even know how to call
it royal blue but it's like it is just
so show-stopping it is just I'm obsessed
with that color next we have the shade
hustle which is a shimmer and this one
is one of the only truly cool toned
shimmer that we do have in the palette
but I wanted to add in of course took a
really nice kind of pale gray with a
little bit of like honestly purple
undertones and a pinch of like a greyish
purple leaf but definitely on the cool
side cuz I was like there's going to be
some people out there who are going to
only want warm shades so I added a few
that were more cool ahh next we have the
shade Meek's
and this color is very near and dear in
my heart because I named it after one of
my very best friend Mike
my son you guys don't see her very often
on camera because we just kind of like
to keep our friendship like that we
don't like to talk about friendship too
much on social media but she is one of
my oldest friends we have been friends
for 11 year now at this point and she
always just does like very kind of like
minimalistic but bronzy makeup and when
I created this color I like might get
this color so you like it's just so
perfect for all over your lid it just
like your perfect bronze shimmer shade
and she's like oh my god I love it and I
wasn't in naming it after you so I've
always called her Meeks my whole life so
that is why this color is Meeks I would
not seriously probably be Who I am or
where I am without my guy just love her
so much and I'm so happy that she has a
color in my palette I actually have a
little bit of this on the center of my
lid right now it's a teensy bit dab
right on the center but mainly I'm
wearing this next color this next coat
you guys are the trickiest color in the
palette and understand that a lot of
people are going to be like why does
have any pigment why does this not go on
right because you really need to apply
it with your finger or with a very wet
brush and the reason why is because it
is pressed very hard because there's a
lot of glitter in it but I didn't want
any fallout whatsoever so when this goes
on it literally looks like it is wet
like it has a straight wetness to it but
it's what keeps the glitter from falling
out the glitter is really compacted
inside of it it's just like the most
beautiful like if you blend it out you
can see like the glitter just like
raining out of it like it's so gorgeous
and it doesn't feel like anything else
in the palette so please when you use
that shadow use your finger or a very
wet brush to put it on if you going with
a dry brush it's not going to work but I
wanted to be in there because if you use
it right it is like the best color ever
I use it all the time like I said it's
where I have on my lid right now is a
little bit of mix on top in the center
next we have a matte and this is called
chip this one is a much more cool with a
purplish undertone in it mass Brown and
then right next to that we have mocha
which is way more sorry if you nail I
can't like properly do anything with
them I need to get them done so bad in
boys market una but mocha is a much more
warm fuzzy ground which mocha is what I
have
out here on the outer corner of my eye
today and there is the full fourth row
of the pallet okay we are now on the
very last row in the first color in this
row so beautiful it is a duochrome in
the shade pool party it is so gorgeous
it's part gold and parts aqua blue so
you can see combined it is like just
summertime perfection which is why I
named it pool party for obvious reasons
I love this this is like my favorite
color to put on my lower lashline with
like a bronze smokey eye on top with
this in the lower lash line it's just
like so gorgeous and beaming and summery
this next shade in the palette is a
matte and it is so gorgeous this one was
actually very difficult and I named it
after my niece Jada because this is her
favorite color ever and soon as I saw it
I was like oh my god Jay would love this
and I actually haven't even told her
that I named after her yet because I
want to take her like the picture of
like all of the color to her house where
it has her name I want to show her I
want to surprise her so I know she'll be
so excited so that is the shade Jada now
for this green and green gave me trouble
this is a high shine foiled with glitter
at it in it so it's like very intense
very likely just metallic band in your
face I love the color like the undertone
in this green because like I have
mentioned I didn't want it where the
focus original I didn't want to look too
much like Christmas or too much like
spring and one it's just just to get a
perfect kind of a neutral tone marine
that will go Brown bronzes reds oranges
and just never look like the holidays
then right next to it we have a matte
green to match that because I love a
beautiful matte green so I wanted to
create one is very very similar that you
can wear with that color or you could
wear like completely different you can
put this on your lower last time you saw
where's Ravi shades matte green is a
very easy pop of color to use if you ask
me because if it's like done in a
certain way it doesn't look like it's
colorful but it'll select make your eyes
pop then I have a Mac very cool tone
brown and you guys know that I wanted to
name it
Central Perk
didn't want to get any trouble like with
like the TV show or anything because
that's what I actually wanted to name it
after the show friend it's a coffee
house it's called Central Perk because
it just looks like the color of coffee
to me so that's why I made it Central
Park
second to last we have the shade soda
pop which me and Linda we're so excited
about the shade because sorry my swatch
they're getting kind of messy because I
keep wiping my finger like off on a wet
like little towelette and then it's like
swatching uneven but whatever you get it
this is a super super dark purple at
this on-camera doesn't look as dark as
it is in person but in person it's dark
like it almost looks black but it's a
purple which I love you put it on your
lower lashline and no one's ever going
to actually see that it's a purple we're
just going to make your eye color just
stand out even more which I did that
with the green and with the purple I
wanted them to be very dark and very
deep that way they're more wearable
because you can put it on your lower
lash line your outer corner it doesn't
really look like color you know but yet
it still is it'll still make your eyes
stand out and then last but certainly
not least we have a bit which is just
black as can be in that with a really
hard one I really use Linda's help on
this one because we want to be very
creamy and very black we didn't want to
look gray we want it to look black so
there we have it this in final row of
vitaliy all right you guys that is it
