go let's do this I'm number one I like
the big town
hi so Mike we're a tow truck ready yes
that's why I waited for the glass the
lipstick can of course if you laugh
because so damn funny if your coffee and
you can't do that I'm not going to wash
it up I will you work in the asshole
John I know what it always come yet hey
sure you close your eyes are asleep and
close them hmm hey guys this is what's
happening hey guys this is what's
happening
I came up to Chicago to spend a couple
of weeks with my sister I asked you guys
what you thought of us doing this video
and you were really into it
so I took the original tag and we
modified it a little bit I got all of
your opinions and all the questions that
you guys really were asking the same
thing I kind of compiled them just to
turn it into like one sister tag it's
still the exact same amount of questions
as the original one so yeah that's it
and I hope you enjoy it it's gonna be a
 show I'm gonna have my drink
it just feels healthier how old are you
I'm 30 as of last week but let's say I'm
29 for the second year in a row and how
old are you I am 22 baby yay seven years
apart a lot of you guys were asking our
difference in age we are seven years
apart well it almost seems like aches I
turned thirty but her birthday is coming
up so that's why we're seven years apart
but F we're comparing maturity levels it
seems like two I didn't want much sure
when I lost my charm
okay so this we have each other in one
word I'm going to say you are bold and
personality which is almost always good
because you get done I would say
perfection because even though she's not
perfect she's a perfectionist but she's
still basically perfect I mean like
obviously there's more than one word but
whatever for one word to sum it up I
would say perfection
okay do people ever mix you up no no
never never
okay what is something that annoys you
about one another
oh my god do it smegal crackle oh you
can go you can go first on that question
I feel like you have so much more energy
than me that when it comes to like
towards the end of the day I have a hard
time keeping up I wouldn't really say I
wouldn't say annoying it's more like I'm
so exhausted
my ass is dragging across much more and
you're still don't wait like a whirlwind
of energy okay so my energy level is
what annoys you and not today um what is
something that annoys you about me
probably again your perfection because
you're so perfect
okay you know what you can understand
John I got it her husband is filming for
us right now don't bring him into it you
know why is it us because she's such a
perfectionist it's almost like she kind
of um wants you to be as perfect as her
so it can definitely be like but that's
okay moving on what what does it like to
be a sister to a YouTube guru mm well
yeah so when we're alone it's like
normal because we're just sisters
hanging out she does talk a little bit
more about herself than usual what when
we go out and public like today we went
out shopping and would feel appalled all
the stuff and people would not leave her
alone that's that's the big difference
is we can't really go out as much
do things just the two of us haven't
actually like accepted the fact that I'm
actually like a guru like let's get real
I'm not a guru I do makeup but
everywhere we go someone does recognize
her which is like so your bizarre for me
aired but awesome I have like she loves
me and talked to me I love it so don't
stop stop just being a little turd
nugget okay but I love you guys too okay
what do you mind most about one another
oh my hair how great I don't that's not
a good way to put it but how what I
don't know how to put the terms I hey
what a good mother she is that's how you
say it she is one of the best know the
best mom that I've ever seen other than
our mother she takes so much pride and
be a mom and she loves her children so
much and treats them like oh my god and
she knows how to crack the whip when
necessary and she knows how to play with
them and she is just the best mom in the
entire world I can say that if I never
do have kids she is gonna be the first
and one and only person that I'm
definitely gonna be like how do you do
it because that's where she definitely
shines wow that was like really touching
but I admire most about you that it
doesn't matter how many people cut you
down or say bad things about you you
never give up on your dreams and you
never give up on what you want to do
with your life and you never believed
them you may get like sad in a moment
like this person said this about me but
like it doesn't stick with you like you
brush it off and you move forward and
you're like it doesn't matter like this
is what I think of myself and this is
what I'm gonna do with my life has your
sister learned a lot from you I didn't
they were referring to makeup when they
said that not like is she just so damn
amazing that you learned so much from
her have you learned a lot from me
makeup wise I have learned a lot because
I used to be really involved with makeup
years ago and then I had my two kids and
it pretty much became mom makeup which
you know is like mascara or nothing
so I decided about six months ago to
like get back into the swing of regular
life of makeup and the way I did that
was jumping on and watching her videos
and I was like I can't do that like even
though I'm like really busy I don't do
everything she shows I pick up like
little things here and there and I'm
like I could do that
Booya that's all I'm asking is who is a
troublemaker growing up what's your
favorite memory with each other that's a
whole video in itself just in general my
favorite memory is really mom and dad
would go to town and they would have a
babysitter oh my god terrorizing back
then I would be like 17 still like a
senior in high school and there's a
babysitter I thought oh my gosh it was
so bad and you're like boozing yourself
up like behind their back like obviously
I have favorite memories from just like
today but like what first comes to my
mind is we used to travel a time with my
parents like we traveled all around the
world doing trips like Africa India
everywhere you can think of and going on
those long trips on those 18 hour plane
ride course it was such a bad experience
we're going to travel for three days
straight but like those were some of the
funniest memories ever like finally
getting to Africa to this hole at the
wall like peeing in the floor your hair
caught on fire and you start bawling
your eyes no it was me Oh Sharon you're
screaming so I jump up but NIC and Rick
were thicker hair out of their truck hey
what was your worst fight and how do you
overcome it
worst quite good I really don't have
like it we used to fight really really
bad growing up I'll just say that we are
seven years apart
I stole everything from her I went into
a room and I would just take everything
and not tell her and she would come home
so mad at me like your sweater one time
when we were fighting and broke your
heel from Palm Springs like we used to
fight really
Valley it was Dorie like we would
physically fight one times you try our
hair dryer was drying her hair and she
was so mad at me that while it was hot
she put on my arm burped me with it okay
it was so bad and my mom would just let
us fight and my dad would get so angry
he'd be like oh hey
mm just let him go we got over it
I just with age we got over it and I
just learned to understand that she
didn't hate me I was obsessed with
thinking that she hated me I just
learned her saying that she didn't hate
me and it was just actually needed a bit
who takes longer to get ready let's see
moving on heels or flats heels pants or
dresses trans I love dresses but like
day-to-day I won't like cute pants most
embarrassing moment together its
together Oh together oh I have one okay
okay most embarrassing are like rose so
I can't talk about it ever mine is
really disgusting my Dubai developer
holes no we can't go far this is yeah my
life
Oh what is one habit your sister does it
drives you crazy um this doesn't drive
me crazy but it's just a really strong
habit that that you have you go oh yeah
I do that she only does it when she's
feeling something like if she's feeling
like tense or like annoyed or nervous
like she would start doing it right now
Oh got it okay uh what happened that I
doesn't really affect my life so cuz I
can't really called annoying but I just
find it like food is it you're really
super messy I am yeah she just leaves
her clothes won all over her makeup is
all I have too much I can't take it I
need a bigger house so yeah I don't
understand no she just leaves her stuff
everywhere so let's see what I have
just crazy are you too competitive with
each other not anymore
not now no like I'm always happy for
everything that you do yeah I mean years
ago like she could be like oh my god
Jack Lynn I just made $30,000 in one day
I don't even know how but poof I'm rich
I'm going our family watch my kids for
free and I'd be like you rock like guys
like I would be like so proud I wouldn't
even think I rock did I we would not
expect anything I would be let me watch
your screaming children I'll take care
of it you're amazing
what did you used to steal give each
other from her nothing because her hymen
years younger well and your stuff was
all over the place it was always like
smelly and stained and ripped and smelly
I mean now if you live by me I would
steal your makeup yeah but I just take
everything from her like everything like
her body lotion she decides and she
never wanted to use she complained about
all the time I won't go in and take it
from her and it should fight for me and
coming in the middle the night and like
beat me with it I like I took everything
from her and she got so pissed all the
time
who is the goofiest I'm definitely the
goofiest like she's she's like goofy but
I'm like I'm so quirky like you either
like love me or you hate me but key
words are period so Jenna you're
watching a video earlier this is your
tag to get an idea like what it is and
when we're watching it they like on to
the inside joke portion and they just
went off on this rampage so we were like
okay accent little oh you so funny and
it's so cute but like yeah it's like
it's amazing that you guys are laughing
so hard that you're crying but like we
don't get it so we're not gonna talk
about inside jokes that's why they're in
salchow good one okay the last one is if
you're if your house is burning down and
your family is safe what is the one
thing you would save my next time if my
house was brought into the garage I
wouldn't care about anything you did my
family was safe I feel like okay do I
have my family that's all let me go grab
my eyeshadow and my 217 brush like are
you joking absolutely my wallet because
if my house is burned to the ground I
got
sleep somewhere so we're going to the
hotel that was treat maybe my computer
so I would have all my pitch I would
definitely my computer
I grabbed my computer so I have all my
family photos that'd be good okay so you
guys survived probably the longest
sister tag of all time I'm sorry this
was 45 minutes and we love you forever
and bye if your house is burning down
and your whole family is insulted what
is the one thing you would save</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
