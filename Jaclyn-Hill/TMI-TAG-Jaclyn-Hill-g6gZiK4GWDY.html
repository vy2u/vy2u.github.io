it via TMI tag I was tagged to do this
video by the beautiful candy Johnson and
so many of you guys have asked me to do
this video or a new question and answer
video apparently want to know more about
my life so there are a lot of questions
I'm going to be reading them off of my
phone so let's just get started
I am wearing this denim button-up shirt
by Rachel's oh it has a little cutout in
the back by the collar and I was wearing
white destroyed denim with it but that
got uncomfortable throughout the day so
I'm now wearing these Zara jeans if you
like sweatpants
yes yes I have I am married so let's
hope
yes yes I have
I am five six and a half almost five
seven and this is like a big thing
because I thought I was five seven for
like three years and then my mom
actually measured me flat-footed a
couple of months ago and we're like oh
my gosh I'm not technically five seven
I'm barely almost two five seven so
technically I'm five six and a half so
by six and half
I don't own a scale so I can't get on
one right now and tell you because I
totally would because I'm not one of
those people who cares about weight like
whatever your weight does not define you
I don't care how fat or how skinny you
are
who cares it's just a weight it just a
number it's about how you feel and if
you think you look good but I am
anywhere between 118 and 124 for the
past year and a half to two years I've
fluctuated between 118 and 124 so I feel
a little bloated today so I'm just
hitting 124
no tattoos my husband has tons of
tattoos it is not for me I've definitely
had my moments for a minute there I
really did think that I was going to get
one on the upper part of my back and I
was like I'm ready I'm gonna do this but
I look at my mom and she's so beautiful
and so timeless and she doesn't have any
tattoos and I'm like I don't want them
either
I obviously have my ears pierced I have
to hear in my ears I used to have a lip
ring and a nose ring so I did have two
four six at one point but now I just
have four
I don't know what OTP means I don't get
it like someone said something about how
I had to do is like a couple in
Hollywood that they loved I really don't
know I don't know a couple in Hollywood
that I love they seem to all just break
up and
oh okay so I can't pick between four
shows and that is modern family friends
the office and Sex in the City I just
can't I just can't I mean like Sex in
the City
modern family friends no success city
friends mark I can't even put it from 1
to 4 like those 4 are my all-time
favorites I have to have every single
one of them in my life still in weekly
basis I have them all on DVD for
favorite shows of life
I'm gonna say Coldplay because I'm not
gonna start needing every single band
that I love so I'm just going to say
Coldplay Coldplay actually was pretty
much the entire soundtrack of john mize
wedding I actually walked down the aisle
to Coldplay
so yeah I'm they can do no wrong I love
a Coldplay
my sister and her family of course my
brother-in-law and then their two kids
Sophia and Caleb ha I miss them so so so
much every single day of my life I miss
them they live up in Chicago and I live
down here in Florida but they're
actually coming to stay with us next
week and I'm so excited as you know but
I miss them every single day like I've
told you guys before family is the most
important thing in the entire world to
me so I wish that they live by me so bad
are you kidding favorite song there is
nobody that could have answered this
question here on YouTube like honestly
how can anyone pick a favorite song
maybe I could give you like a top three
like depression songs like top three
like I just want to dance my head off
songs but I can't just give you like one
song let me think I'm sorry I can't but
if it was something it wouldn't be like
Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry it would be
like
I am 23 I said 1 &amp;amp; 3
I'm a cancer which is the worst thing to
say like oh I'm cancer
positivity great sense of humor
confidence and just being sweetheart
some Abu John Hill
oh my gosh this has got to be the
hardest question in the entire world
because I have like 500 million quotes
that I'm obsessed with and I try to live
by so I don't know this is gonna seem
cheesy but honestly one of my most
favorite like basic quotes is what Sally
says of Suzy says more of Sally than of
Suzy and I know it's not just tongue
twister and it's so like bouncing off of
say I sell seashells down by the
seashore boom but it's so simple and I
love the meaning behind it and it's so
true
okay so when I hear actor I'm assuming I
can also say actress so again like I
would have to say Tom Hanks and Julia
Roberts because I can't
again pick one I have to pick two and I
absolutely love Julia Roberts and I love
Tom Hanks and like I've I've said a
million times if I saw the Kardashians
in person which I have seen um Courtney
in person but like it's just kind of
like yeah that's a Kardashian that's
weird like there they are in person oh
yeah they look a little different with
the exact same but if I saw Tom Hanks or
Julia Roberts I would probably just sit
in the corner and be like oh oh yes like
I just respect them I think that they
are both so amazing like they're real
actors they are real real actors and I
love them both
white and I know that sounds weird but
like honestly white I'm such a neutral
person my entire house is done in white
and ivory and like Silver's and just I
love white it's so clean it's so crisp
I just I love neutrals so my favorite
color is white
loud music obviously unless you're
trying to go to sleep like relax and
you're like stressed and taking a bath
then obviously I'm not gonna be like but
for the most part loud music all day
every day
um not a physical place but my husband
and my mother for sure maybe my mom's
house but like my husband and my mom
definitely the two people who bring me
back up my sister as well but my sister
she lives across the country so I don't
have like access to her as much as I
would like to so my husband my mom are
usually people that I physically am with
when I'm sad and then my bed and then
Ben and Jerry's
I honestly can't take the fastest
showers in the entire world like there's
times I take a shower
three minutes done and I don't know but
then there's other times that I'm in
there for three minutes I'm just like
laying there like huh
again that totally depends on what the
occasion is whether I'm hanging out my
friends or not doing anything or going
anywhere really but anywhere between 15
minutes and 2 hours if I'm going to do a
little something or I'm gonna do
everything
I'm going to actually have to say yes
because I grew up with a sister so for
the other girls out there who grew up
with sisters yes I have another physical
fight I have never been in like an
alleyway physical fight with like some
random person like beating them to the
ground
my only physical fight has been with my
sister yeah a few times for sure but you
know I was always the victim
positivity for sure just anyone who's
positive sees the good things in life
and isn't just like mmm positivity yes
entitlement I can't I can't stand
teittleman I can actually say I hate
entitlement I absolutely hate it I mmm
entitlement like no just no
I joined YouTube because when I was
working at the MAC store at Woodfield
Mall so many of my clients wanted me to
do makeup tutorials on YouTube so they'd
have to come in and constantly be paying
the fee to get their makeup done so I
started I do even know like what
subscribers were really I didn't
understand whatsoever and Here I am two
years later
I don't even want to discuss my fears
because I don't even want to put them
out in the open and let them go into
your minds and then you guys think like
oh I've never thought about that that is
something to be afraid of like I do not
like having fears I try very hard to
overcome my fears as much as I can so
I'm not going to talk about my fears
my niece's both wrote me thank-you cards
because I took them on this big day of
shopping and then we went to the pool
and they wrote me these long thank-you
cards I had like pictures of a shopping
together pictures at the pool together
and like this big heart with us like
hugging in the center and it was just so
sweet that I shed a little tear it
wasn't like oh oh my god but it was like
a okay I love you guys
today I think I say I love you to
somebody at least every hour of my life
it's my name
I don't read books like to talk about
this is my question and answer video as
well I'm not proud that I don't read
books I just don't get into books I read
through magazines I just don't I just
I'm not a book person never will be
never have been can't do it
I think it was fashion police I think
my husband told him to leave me alone so
I could film this video
so the last person I text was my best
friend chase and yeah he's my best
friend
he's fabulous and he completes me
God have you say Mexican food think so I
can't live without enchiladas and rice
and beans hmm
but then sushi and crab legs I'm a
foodie I love food
for Bora boom like I do not like flying
at all but I would I would suffer suffer
the plane ride to go to Bora Bora
smoothie king
I mean I'm married so young crush ever
today
hello have you not seen my Instagram
there's probably someone insulting me as
we speak
my chocolate hazelnut caramel
strawberries macaroons like what
favorite flavor of sweet all all of them
I don't play an instrument I took piano
lessons when I was younger that was fun
and my husband is a drummer so like he's
tried to teach me how to play drums I
can like carry a few beats but I don't
actually play an instrument I'm like yay
I'm bored let's go do makeup
um I would have to say my watches I have
two of them I have a gold one or than a
silver one they're both Michael Kors
feel like Michael Kors is such just
crazy popular watch now everyone has
them but that's definitely most warm
piece of jewelry but I have like a
million necklaces that were also
classifies my favorite pieces of jewelry
because I love really small dainty
feminine necklaces so
okay so you guys are gonna laugh at me
but cheerleading was the last sport that
I played and listen it is a sport when
you are sweating that hard and getting
that much of an aerobic workout and
screaming the top of your lungs it is a
sport so yes I last thing I did was
cheerleading
that song 23 by Miley Cyrus and all
those rappers because I said my age was
23 and all of a sudden that was in my
head I was breaking out into song and
dance off camera
are your legs tired these you've been
running through my mind all day
totally I mean all day every day all I
do is walk around trying to pick up
random people on the streets my amazing
pickup lines you know it
