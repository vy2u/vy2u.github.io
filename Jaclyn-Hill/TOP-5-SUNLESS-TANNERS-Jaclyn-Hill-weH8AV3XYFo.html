long-awaited sunless tanner video I told
you guys weeks ago that I would be doing
this video soon and I have had so many
requests for it so basically I'm going
to tell you the sunless Tanner's that I
like things I like about them things I
don't like about them kind of helping
you which way to go according to what
your needs are in self-tanning so I'm
going to just go ahead and start with
the first one that I have owned for the
longest time I have owned this for about
four and a half years and this is the
st. Tropez bronzing lotion they have a
bronzing mousse as well st. Tropez has
got a lot of hype right now they have
the really dark one I forgot what it's
called the extreme dark mousse and they
have all different kinds but this is the
bronzing lotion it is a dark brown color
brown it's like so Brown that it's like
green um but anyways so since the sense
this is brown when you put it on your
body you can really see where you're
putting it exactly and rubbing it in I
do like this I have used it for so long
I will say for the price I think that it
should last a lot longer for me
personally it does not matter how much I
prepare my skin for it and shower shave
exfoliate yes I used to work at a
tanning bed so I had to say that drill
all the time but anyways for the price
that you're spending on this I think
that it should last a little bit longer
than it does it only lasts on my skin
for about three to four days tops and
then after that it's like my tan is
completely gone so I do like the color
gives you though I don't think it's very
long so that's kind of a disappointment
but it is a good basic color it gives
you a nice glow it gives you a little
bit of darkness but it doesn't make you
like holy-moly on tan it's just it's
it's a little something-something now I
apply all of my sunless tanners with a
glove this is the Saint Tropez glove
this one is brand new so it's not dirty
at all but you just put on your hand
like this like a glove and then you just
rub on your
products all over your body so that you
don't get your hands all disgusting it
to wash it off
it's one thing I will say about the
saint-tropez is if you do not put a
glove on or use some sort of applicator
this stuff is going to stain your hands
no matter what you do I have tried
scrubbing it with like lemon juice and
sea salt and Clorox like you cannot get
this stuff off of your hands it's insane
so that's one downside to it so I really
recommend using the glove um they're
sold a sephora right alongside of the
st. Tropez and they used to use that to
rub it on your body and you're good
you'll have an even application with no
nasty hands okay so next in line I don't
know how to pronounce this xen tan
extend tan then tan I'm not sure they
say that this is one a lot of
celebrities use I don't know I don't buy
into that stuff but it says quick dry
formula for face and body with instant
color oil free paraben free long wearing
natural olive undertone vanilla set um I
have to disagree with the natural olive
undertone in this that's the one there's
two downsides to this but the one
downside is that the natural olive
undertone I did not get that at all this
made me go from like a yellowy based
skin tone to a pink brown base this does
not give me any golden tone whatsoever
it just made me Brown and when I used it
it turned me a color that I've never
been before where I was just straight-up
Brown it smells really good it does it
smells like straight vanilla smells like
a vanilla like snow cone or vanilla
smoothie smells really good but I will
say that it was so sticky this one felt
wet all day long to the point that when
I would like extend my arm I would feel
it like right here just like oh it
freaks me out so much it started making
me anxious after like five hours of
having it on I was like I have to shower
I can't take this anymore this is so
sticky I feel so gross like I just felt
it all over the place like my clothes
were sticking to me everything was just
so nasty so that's the one thing I will
say but if you want to be brown one
hundred-percent brown
no golden undertone and you don't mind
that stickiness for four to six hours
then you would really really like this I
personally like a more natural golden
olive undertone base tanner
I think it looks more natural I think it
looks prettier and I think that makeup
looks better on that tone as opposed to
just straight brown when it's not
natural Josie Maran has a tanning
product this is the Argonne self-tanning
cream I purchased this online I have not
seen it in stores now I will be honest
with you the only thing that I use this
for is my face because the skin on my
face is so showy sensitive and I am dry
so the argan oil does me good it gives
you a really natural all-over golden
color it's very very light very natural
I sometimes just said once a week I put
it on at nighttime with my other
products before I go to sleep and I'll
wake up and my skin will just have this
really nice even golden tone it's not
like whoa that's brown it doesn't give
you like that weird mustache that like
the sunless tanners will give you when
you put on your face and you're like
scrubbing it because you're like why is
there so much pigmentation there this
one is really natural really good for
your skin won't clog your pores
hydrating so on and so forth I would not
spend the money on this for my entire
body though because it's not going to do
much for you it's going to change you
like half a color so this is definitely
something that I use for the face I love
it if you have a really really pale face
like I do and then your body has color I
would definitely go with this and yes my
face is very pale because I use the
Clarisonic and eiseley every day
sometimes twice a day
and I use vitamin C moisturizers so my
skin is a lot lighter than the skin on
my body so I appreciate products like
this that will give me a little extra
something so I'm not like but white on
the face this is a drugstore product
next this is the L'Oreal sublime run
self tanning towelette this is awesome I
love these I first got introduced C's
when I was working at Mac in Chicago
some girl came in for
she had the most beautiful tan and I
would not stop freaking her out like why
is your chest so perfect what did you do
is that airbrush like why are you so
perfect like her tan was impeccable it
was amazing when she told me was the
lori ellis abrupt sublime bronzed
towelettes well obviously this girl does
have perfect skin and a perfect skin
tone and already had a natural color and
I was just like obsessing over it
because you always what what you can't
have but these do work they're really
great once again they turn you a golden
color which is that's what I'm all about
I'm all out the golden I'm not crazy
about brown I like to be Bowlin so it
gives you a really beautiful no Orange
no streaks I will say the great thing
about this is it says on your Street
free it really is streak free like
there's no streaks it's very even it
will take you from probably can NC 20 to
90 25 I would say or maybe if there was
like an NC 27 like something in there
it's not going to be a drastic
difference it's going to just enhance
the glow and give you a little glow it's
not going to make you dark these are
great though they're cheap they're the
only towels they come like this you open
this up it's a white towel it looks and
feel like you're applying water you
can't see anything you just rub it into
your body
my husband's calling me hi Balu sorry
okay so next I'm going to talk about my
favorite tanning products of all time I
saved the best for last I have owned
these products for about two years I've
gone through a few of them I love them
so much I don't know how I first heard
about them but they're amazing I've got
all my friends and I family obsessed
with them they're the best so it is
million-dollar tan tanning products if
you have not seen these well then time
to wake up these are the bomb oh my gosh
so there's two different ones there's
one that's a spray and there's one
that's a pump and I will break them down
for you the one that's a spray it comes
out like dark dark dark brown you can
see it up there in the top of the bottle
and you spray onto the sponge that it
comes with
then I just drench the sponge and then
you go in and you just paint your body
and so that's it's so dark you can see
every single thing that you're doing I
stand in front of a mirror and I paint
every single piece of my skin and you're
going to look so dark it's going to be
insane and then you let it sit for four
to six hours and then you get in the
shower afterwards you wash yourself off
you're going to see tons of the brown
come off in the shower because the color
guard is coming off but everything I
have soaked into your skin is still
going to be there this is going to get
you so dark in all the right ways the
one with the spray this is hands down
the best tanning anything I've ever used
in my life
as far as getting a beautiful natural
dark tan no joke this will take you from
an NC 20 to an NC 40 and 4 to 6 hours
and I'm talking a Mac foundation it is
amazing it looks so natural it's that
golden olivey tone it's not that like
dark unnatural streaky brown it's so
natural it is beautiful whenever I wear
this people are always like oh you into
the beach look at you you got color and
I'm like no and then this one right here
this is about the pump this is white
this one is just literally it comes out
stark white like when you put it on it
looks like you're applying Elmer's glue
and it's so that you can see exactly
what you're doing
rub it in using the glove or just even
if you want to use just like latex
medical loves whatever just so your
hands don't get stained and you don't
have like orange all over the place so
you rub that in even after 4 to 6 hours
it'll start to develop and you'll start
to smell it because when you first apply
it it smells like it's unscented and
what I mean by that is you know how when
you buy an unscented products it says
unscented but it still has that scent
it's like the scent is unscented anyways
you know what I mean so it smells
unscented and then once you've had it on
for like two hours all of a sudden you
start to smell that kind of typical
sunless tanner smell it's not disgusting
it's not as bad as Mystic Tan what you
start to smell it and whenever I smell
that I know it's time to wash it off
soon because that means it's really
developing this stuff is so dark I don't
need the full power of it I mean there's
time
I only put on for three hours and wash
it off because it is dark it's amazing
so it's so versatile because someone who
wants to get really really dark can use
this and leave it on for like eight
hours and someone who just wants a
little something-something can leave it
on play an hour and a half this sponge
really makes it so easy so that nothing
looks broken up or unblended it's it's
awesome and they also have one for the
face that I love this is the Cabana tan
extreme face it doesn't clog my pores it
doesn't make me sensitive doesn't break
me out so on and so far I love this
stuff it's darker than the Josie Maran
actually gives my face color when I
apply it I apply everywhere and then I
always do my t-zone area laughs so I
start on the cheeks and then I move up
to the forehead I get my ears I go down
I blend it into the face face and then
whatever is left on my fingers
afterwards I then go over my t-zone over
my nose and over my upper lip area and
then between my eyebrows because that
area tends to pick up more pigmentation
so make sure that I do that last
I would never pump it and then start in
that area because you're going to be
super dark in the center of your face
and you always want to be lighter there
and darker out here because it's going
to look more natural so with that being
said I do have a coupon code for you
