closer unless you're doing this hey guys
welcome back to my channel so for
today's video as you can see by the
title we are going to be doing
truth or dare I am so excited they're
nervous probably because they know that
I'm not crazy yes
and when they say dare Mama's gonna go I
tweeted about doing this video no we
literally all retweeted it yeah so many
people have sent like the best ideas so
I'm basically not gonna be thinking of
anything original I'm scan you taking
your ideas from Twitter right now yeah
so we actually have something a total of
three videos today so at this point
Manny and Laura's other videos have both
been absolute you haven't seen them yet
I will link that in the description box
down below
laura has to get ready with me and then
the one on Minnie's channel is a food
challenge it's the most disgusting food
challenge it's like actually like talk
about anymore so guys how we're gonna do
it is we're both like I'm gonna beg to
the dare to them both and they're both
gonna do the truth and both gonna do the
dare yeah so like they had to like
decide together otherwise it might not
work being like just too many yeah it
might not be a factor
I got it okay so okay Manny we're dead
let's start this came from Abby her name
is AB stir to 55 okay she said truth
what is one thing that you guys really
don't like in each other's and makeup
routine
if not I have film videos and I've been
so pale that I'm like not today not
today
and so I will literally put foundation
on my arms my hands it's too fucking my
whole body foundation by my hair we have
some pickle spoon dare dare them to make
out with their hands for 15 seconds
absolutely go come on turn to the side
so they can see there you go John you're
getting into it come on there we go girl
pickle okay so I'm gonna dare them to
pick up a highlighter compact and lick
the compact Oh
my other highlighter shattered while
traveling yes honey just use it while
it's about to be covered in slime
deserves to be used glow goals by Nikki
tutorial I'm getting my tongue not too
wet okay cuz I want to see the ha I'm so
sorry for the highlight on my god I
cannot wait I got you but you get a good
leg honey ready okay go 1 2 3 go
uh-oh it's gross it's nasty
[Laughter]
like minded is too bad it just tastes
like nothing
truth or dare ladies
oh we're doing truth yeah okay so
inspire me her name is Becca buffer she
said truth ask them how they feel about
you as a person what you really think of
so like a really true like if you're not
it's not like true true true if it's not
like the truest like you will be haunted
by penny wise okay okay understand we
should the beauty as a whole should
appreciate you that Jaclyn was one what
if not the first youtubers who ever
collab with a major big brand and that
if it wasn't for being Jaclyn Hilda did
it she set the pathway for all of us it
made every big brand believe in
youtubers as a whole because it's how
successful she is okay and how she made
it such a huge thing so you kind of set
the pathway other brands were like oh
this is what youtubers do well now I
want to work with them but it was
because of you with someone else and
they thought it was like everybody in
this community needs to thank God every
day it was Jacqueline oh I think this
can go like good and bad can I get you
literally I think that you are such a
passionate person and sometimes you're
passionate like maybe it's like people
will take it the wrong way when it's
like not to like it miss Ghetts miss you
superfast so it's like you have to
really like go out of your way to
explain yourself more than you have to
all you have to do I think it just looks
like it stems from the passion like it
sounds I'm like having passion behind
something I feel like it could be baked
could be put in a bad way I just like
that passionate person in general yeah
but I get opinion I can get perceived in
like a bad and a good way yeah that's it
you guys you have anything actually
truth like nasty about me no and I was a
huge fan you before you go yeah so
literally like I don't even have any
never your so you know me man actually
Matt because he was like you wouldn't
stop tweeting me please get Jacqueline
to like my tweets can you guys tag her
so this so follow me I think who is this
guy and then I watch these videos I was
like wait I like him so we're so we have
to sassy for you truth who do you guys
think is the worst and the best youtuber
I'm the worst
drama channels only had their pin ready
like oh I'm totally shaded myself I am
the voice youtuber yeah for sure I use
upload one video a week every week and
I'm like a sassy we could all just feel
like a little feisty out upload to and
now like I upload like oh god really
like maybe three videos a month it's
getting it sucks and I hate that cuz
like everyone else that I always have
like loved whatever they fall off I'm
like what do you do we are going on yeah
but I'm about to hire an editor so weeks
and I hadn't upload the me oxide I had
the time to edit yeah she's like but
she's gonna edit this one but know who's
your worse viewers you're actually in my
ear my best category okay I'll say as a
whole I think channels that make up
fabricated lies forget adsense money are
the worst youtubers on the internet and
you
[Laughter]
whether it's a whether it's a youtuber
who's lying about a sponsored video yes
for best mine I only know the beauty
community really I don't know much
outside it'd be to give me so for me I
you guys are both bomb but I'm not gonna
say you guys you were both so consistent
but I will say for sure for me it's
potty every time I log into YouTube and
check my subscription on mic oh my god
I've been away for two days and she's
uploading 35 she's so good and like her
light he's always bomb or editing he's
always like Oh Bob oh my everything my
bestest outside gonna be the community
cuz I watch a lot yeah I'm gonna say
Casey nice app because I believe he yeah
well did the way of vlogging is like
every vlogger vlogs like Casey no I
shouldn't say every blogger but majority
bloggers took the way he vlogs and now
that suits the way blogging is done he
can upload seven days a week too so
geez I think it's time for a dare
I think I may need to apply highlighter
to Jeff when snows and hot cheeks go out
with his toes what she licked that way
it sanitary perfect what it smells bad
me probably happier for he's not gonna
make it cleaner you guys by the way he's
using a morphe five-10 eat any breakfast
