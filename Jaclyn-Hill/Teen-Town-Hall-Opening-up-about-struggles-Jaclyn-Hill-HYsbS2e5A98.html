different video something that I have
never done anything remotely close to
before I am super excited about it first
of all I apologize for the messy
background I have my camera sitting on
my desk right now where I sit and do
work on my computer in the background
the lighting right now is just natural
daylight and it's about to rain so it's
like super gray gloomy so I'm sorry
about that but I need to sit down and
film this intro for you guys and I don't
have that long to do it so I recently
had the opportunity to work with Lauren
Lloyd she is a Hollywood producer and
she recently started a project called
teen town hall which is a project in
which she is holding events in different
cities around the u.s. and basically
gathering a group of teenage girls
together into the same room and sitting
them down and talking about issues going
on in our society right now whether it's
bullying body image anxiety depression
pressure whatever it may be suicide I
mean anything you can think of just
issues that we have in this world and
things that we have to deal with as
teenage girls she's bringing them
together and giving them a safe zone and
a safe place to sit down and discuss
these things and then what she's doing
is she's recording it with her team and
she's turning it into online webisodes
hoping to share this with the world and
get this known generation talking and
feeling confidence and feeling good
about themselves and in feeling like
they can grow up and they can change the
world they can take over the world and
we as women can be empowered and do this
together and so when she reached out to
me through email and asked me to host
her first event I was like done done and
done like I was so excited to be a part
of this because it's right up my alley
even though I talk about makeup here all
the time on my channel and I'm like and
now we're gonna use that tan carnitine
rash my heart and soul is definitely all
about this like all about it so I was so
excited to host the event so here in a
minute you're gonna see a sizzle reel
that her team put together for you guys
it's like a preview for what went down
but I wanted to film an intro first just
to kind of let you guys know what it is
so you're not like what is this when
you're watching it and totally confused
but basically Sheehan chose 30
subscribers of mine from my local area
we all got together one Saturday
afternoon at one o'clock and we spent
the entire day together it was amazing
we were together until like 6 or 7
o'clock that night I think maybe even 8
o'clock that night you're together
all day and it was so amazing spending
an entire afternoon with 30 subscribers
of mine and getting to actually know
people as opposed to meeting creeps like
hi cheese hi cheese oh so being chief
like you know them saying like it was so
awesome to actually have the opportunity
to get to know you guys and hear about
your live and your family and the issues
that you've had in the struggles and
just bond with you guys there were a lot
of laughs there were a lot of Tears it
was just an awesome day and awesome
experience that would forever hold close
and dear to my heart and thank you too
Lauren Lloyd for giving me and 32 my
subscribers that opportunity because it
was amazing and so appreciated
deep breath Wow I don't know why I'm
still like it might just be because I
just had a footlong sub honestly let's
get real it's probably the reason that I
can't breathe today I'm gonna be showing
you guys this is a real of that
afternoon and then going forward her
team is going to turn that day into two
episodes and so you guys will be able to
watch those webisodes online if you want
to I will share them on social media
when they come out I'll let you guys
know on Twitter and Instagram when
they're live if you're curious to watch
them but I just wanted to take the time
to use my voice or something other than
makeup for a minute because even though
this is a makeup Channel and after this
video it will go back to makeup and you
know beauty this is beauty as well this
is just inner beauty which is the most
important thing in the entire world
because none of this means anything if
you're not happy and if you're not
feeling beautiful on the inside so I
just wanted to take a minute to really
let you guys know at the end of the day
that you're not alone and when I was
growing up 13 14 15 16 years old I would
have just killed to have someone say
that to me because that was my biggest
issue is no matter what my problem was
whether it was anxiety depression
whatever it was the feeling of being
alone and not be understood was the
worst feeling ever it was just the
darkest hole like why this happening to
me and I felt like no one else
understood I feel like I had to keep
some things to myself because it's like
no one's gonna get that no one's gonna
understand and I just wanna let you guys
know that no matter what it is that
you're going through someone else is
going through it at that exact same
moment you are
alone is someone has gone through it
before someone will go through it again
you're not alone and I know it's so many
people leave comments and they're you
know on my you to my social media always
saying like oh my god Jacque when your
life is so perfect I'm so jealous my
life is not perfect my life looks
perfect when I look at my Instagram I'm
like they have this girl like a good
life but that's what I choose to show
you guys you know I have issues in my
life I have depression I have anxiety
I've been physically and emotionally
bullied I have issues in my
relationships like I've lost friends
I've lost family members you know I'm
saying my dad's not around anymore
I've been through a lot you know but I
choose to put a smile on my face because
life is so good and there's so many
things to smile about so I just wanna
let you guys know that it's all about
perception and everyone around you
everyone has issues every single person
you see has an issue there's no such
thing as perfect and we all have
struggles and I just want to take a
moment to share that with you guys and
hope that really sucks for some of you
and maybe that will allow you guys to be
nicer and more understanding to those
around you in your environment and going
forward try to make more peace you know
in this world so I hope you guys enjoy
this video I know that it's so random
for most of you but I've been super
excited to show this and show you guys
this is a real so I really hope that you
guys enjoy leave me comments down below
about anything if you guys you know it's
this video it does anything for you if
it inspires you if it makes you want to
share your story leave comments down
below I would absolutely love to see it
so yeah I hope you guys enjoy and going
forward I will be back with more makeup
tutorials so I love you guys thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
soon bye
this gym Hall is about connecting it's
about communicating and inspiring others
like your problems well I've gone to
therapy for all this people and I'm like
right right I feel under my foundation
that's why I don't wear blush I'm gonna
change the world literally who's gonna
help move this world to a better place
and I know in my heart it's you guys
that you guys you young teen women are
gonna do just that so what I wanted to
do was provide a place where girls can
come and talk and it will help you get
to know what your purpose is what you
want to do in the world it's gonna make
you strong powerful creative beans and
then of course Jacqueline because I
wanted to bring it someone who has a
great positive influence on young girls
today let's start bullying on the
internet doing what I do of course
there's like bullies or haters but like
that's not really what I consider like
bullying I'll talk about my experience
of being bullied more when I was your
guys's age because that's when it was
like too legit to quit suddenly she just
hated me she had threatened to show up
at my house with a knife it seemed like
everyone in my grade was against me you
have chipmunk cheeks your ears stick out
oh you're too pale
she's like no your skin is too brown I'm
gonna make everybody hate you and I
tried so many self tanners like I have
all of them sitting in my drawer he had
a wish in the entire world she would
shoot me cut me up into pieces and then
burn me with acid in her backyard that's
what she told her sister about me you're
a whore you're a you used me to get
popular the bullying came from people
that I thought I could trust and it was
my family when people talked to me about
like bullying I'm like
and my belief if I am whenever we go out
my dad's like oh these are my sons and
I'm like girl I thought it was cool to
beat down other people I was very
revengeful when I was younger this girl
had said that I'd bullied her and I was
like I started crying then I was on the
other side of the spectrum and I was
getting bullied she was like you made me
feel so bad about having big eyebrows
that I shaved them and I felt so bad I
felt really really really terrible but I
couldn't I didn't have the guts to talk
to her like couldn't I was weak in
myself
and I never want to be that person and
yeah she came over standing there in
front of my table like I have nowhere to
sit you know and I looked at her like I
knowing very well she's made fun of me
and everything I look to her I'm like in
it come come sit so she came and sat
down and she's actually my best friend
through this day she was my absolute
best friend and I'm gonna be on camera
and on the internet I want to look ok I
don't want to look too chubby or I don't
want my facebook like this and I'm like
no that's that's the complete opposite
reason why I should be here I've always
had a really hard time with body image
some of my earliest memories are being a
little toddler pinching out her thighs
I'm pinching out her stomach and then
looking around like older girls that
were taller and thinner and different
body types and I'm like well why don't I
look like that I look nothing like
although the girls in school after I had
my daughter I hated myself I started
cutting myself I started drinking I'm
coming in here still really struggling
with an eating disorder and I have been
for years I didn't like feeling like I
was always competing with everyone else
which is something that comes from me
that's not something anyone else did I
was the one that became my biggest bully
I overdosed and I tried to commit
suicide a year almost a year ago
convinced my mother that if I took diet
pills and lived a certain way to try to
lose weight maybe I would feel better
about myself and I like fell on the
floor and then I don't remember anything
and then I remember hearing my dad come
in first which my parents have been
divorced since I was 3 and they hate
each other so for them to be uniting
over anything
huge deal don't think that you need a
completely like turning to someone else
to make the person that you're with
happy I lived through that for a reason
and everyone is supposed to be here if
I'm only focused on hating myself I
can't love over there people you can't
be a good best friend to anyone else if
you're not your own best friend and you
have to support yourself I always kind
of just try to look at myself in the
mirror and I'm like you know what I have
a good personality
beauty is relative in terms of what's on
the outside hearing other people being
so strong and brave makes me feel like
one day there really will be a
possibility that I will be like you guys
I mean this is like one of the reasons
why I want to do this I have a contact
sheet with all of your emails and stuff
on it is and I'd like to send it to
everybody so you all can talk to each
other so then Holly when you're feeling
like I don't know what the hell's going
on or you know what you can you can talk
to other people here who you've spent
some unbelievable time with I'm not
gonna remember one of your bodies I
don't care for 500 pounds I don't care
if you're sometime you can put you in my
pocket
I'm not remember any of your bodies to
say honestly I'm gonna remember your
eyes and I'm gonna remember your spirit
that's all I'm gonna take away from
today I like my smile I like how family
oriented is my resilience my humor my
hair no I'm just kidding is my strength
because I can live two times a week
no one can bring you dynasty love
yourself like you are untouchable you
are up here you are on fire the peak of
a mountain and no one can bring you down
if you love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
