hey guys greetings from my home to yours
and welcome to my first holiday makeup
okay
I'll don't decide I am so excited to be
coming this video because I have not
done a makeup tutorial like a fun one
and quite a while so it was fun sitting
down today and coming this look for you
and thank you so much to everyone who
left me comments and tweeted me and gave
me inspiration for this makeup tutorial
I have seen so many great suggestions
for makeup looks I am officially in the
holiday spirit actually that's a total I
rewind
not on the holiday spirit but I'm in the
makeup holiday look spirit you know what
I mean still not ready to put the tree
but I'm ready to beat thy face and a lot
of people were actually requesting warm
smokey eyes like cranberry smokey eyes
and orange smokey eyes and incorporating
red and I was like yes come to mama
like like a fiend who like needs her fix
when it comes to those warm smokey eyes
but I actually saw one comment that asks
for a olive green and gold smokey eye
and it had like a couple hundred thumbs
up and I don't know that comet just
spoke to me and I was like yes I don't
know if I've done a golden like an olive
green silky i if I have it's definitely
been out a long time so I thought it was
time to do one olive green is one of my
favorite colors like we're in clothing I
absolutely love it especially is like a
dark dark forest green okay love it
don't ask why I draw when I start kind
of weird who knew here in my channel
you'll get used to it promise we'll be
friends in no time takes a minute to get
used to me but we'll get there anyways
all babbling inside this is the look
that I came up with thank you so much
for the suggestions do guys gave me
because it's because of you I came up
with this look and I just absolutely
love it I wanted to make it smoky but I
didn't want to make it like level 10
smokey because I feel like Thanksgiving
isn't the time to be drag queen status
for me personally and you know that
that's like a big thing because I'm
always all about my Queens but
Thanksgiving even though I want to do a
smoky eye I like to keep it like a
little bit more fresh than I would for
something like New Year's Eve or even
Christmas I did you can be open top and
glittery and fun but for Thanksgiving
it's like I was playing today with my
family I'm eating
food I'm drinking good wine and so even
though I wanted to do a smokey eye I did
put a cream eyeliner on my waterline
because I didn't want my eyes to look
like too small to close in and to smokey
so if you're ever wondering why you
would apply a cream liner to your lower
waterline as a posting it just
completely blank it's because it will
open up the eyes and make them look much
more fresh awake and wide so if you have
small eyes to begin with it's a great
tip to always put cream liner in there
it'll really make your eyes pop and so
whenever I did a dark smokey eye and I
want to really make sure that you can
still see my eyeballs and not just the
color that's on my lid
I will line my waterline I can have a
hard time talking human-animal i'm i'm
online i will why am i will hold your
body I'm done okay it's been a long day
thank you so much for watching and
sticking around with me I'm so excited
for my upcoming makeup tutorials I have
a list now thanks to you guys keep them
coming though like because sometimes
I'll bake wait no what is this I want to
this ones that I'll just make choices
last-minute so keep your requests coming
for anything if you want to see during
the holiday season and make sure to
subscribe if you want to see any
upcoming festive holiday look so thank
you so much for watching I love you guys
and I'll see you soon bye okay so today
I'm going to be starting with my face
this is personal preference you can
start with the skin eyes whichever
you're comfortable with but today I want
to start with my skin so I'm going to go
in with the Marc Jacobs undercover
coconut primer I've really been loving
this recently and then for foundation
and concealer you're going to see the
same routine that I've done in the past
two videos because of the fact that I am
moving to a new filming space right now
my entire makeup collection is over
there and I've been organizing it so I
only have like the basic everyday
essentials when it comes to my skin at
my house right now so that's why you're
seeing the exact same routine as the
past two videos so I am mixing ad eco
Gendo aqua foundation with the Mac
moisture SPF 15 foundation and then
blending them together I'm going to be
applying it with a Tarte face kabuki
brush and then for my concealer I am
using the of course Urban Decay
weightless Naked concealer this is my
favorite concealer ever and I actually
oh my gosh should you just hear my
Chicago accent come out I said actually
well anyways I actually
we ran out of my color in the middle of
this video and that's why you see me
using that lighter shade I am typically
light medium neutral and I ran out of it
so you saw me just go in with the
straight light one I usually use that
one to highlight so I put that on the
forehead and the chin as well to balance
out the under-eye area if I apply a
light concealer to the under eye area I
always want to even out by applying it
to the forehead and the chin as well to
make it look a little bit more natural
so now I'm just going to be setting my
under eye area I am using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills banana powder and I'm just
going to lightly dust that in the entire
under eye area so that nothing creases
and then I'm going to be going in with
one of my favorite eyeshadows of all
time and this is by Mac and it's called
uninterrupted it is a pro longwear
eyeshadow and I'm applying it with a
morphe four-for-one brush and just
dusting this in my entire crease area
I'm really gonna hoola-hoop the entire
upper lid of the eye all the way from
inner corner to outer corner since we're
going to be applying dark shade on both
inner and outer corner today I want to
make sure that we start by putting a
nice color in that crease and blending
upward as you can see this is not
blending out perfectly it's a little
choppy in the crease area which I was
not happy with I want my crease to be
very blended I don't want any harsh
lines I want nothing to be choppy so I
did decide to go in with a little bit of
makeup geek desert sands this is
basically like uninterrupted little
sister it's very similar to the color
it's just a little bit lighter in shade
so I just grabbed that color and then I
went over top of it and as you can see
it begins to blend out much smoother if
you ever have an issue with an eyeshadow
not blending out it's always a great
idea to grab just one shade lighter of
the similar shade and go over it and
then that will help blend out any harsh
lines now I'm going to be going in with
dirty martini eye shadow again by makeup
geek I love this eyeshadow so much it is
such a beautiful olive green color I
could just throw this all over my lid
and put on some winged liner and be
satisfied so I'm now going in with the
morphe m4 4-3 brush this is one of my
favorite blending brushes but as I got
to the inner corner of the eye I
realized it was a little too fat for
what I wanted to do you could make it
work but because I had this brush I
decided to go in with this one instead
and this is the Sigma e45 it's just a
much more small
precision blending brush and it just fit
that inner corner way better so again on
the outer corner of the eye I will begin
to pack that and kind of blend it upward
but more than anything we're just
concentrating on really packing on that
color so that it's nice and rich and
then kind of blending it into the socket
of the crease and then as we move
forward I will trade out that morphe
brush for the Sigma e45 to make sure
that I get that color nice and precise
on the inner corner you could use a
q-tip for this and then you could blend
it out with like the morphe blending
brush you don't need to use both brushes
but because I have them both I wanted to
use them both because it made it easiest
for me so now I'm grabbing that original
brush and I'm going back in with Mac
uninterrupted and I'm going to put that
in the crease because we are working
with this matte olive green we don't
want it to get muddy and dirty looking
so we're going to make sure that we
continue to go back in with that
original shade to keep that crease
looking nice and warm and blend it out
because we don't want to bring that
olive green up too high so now we're
gonna go in with an even darker green
and this is called enchanted forest oh
my gosh this color is so gorgeous it's
just a much darker version of the
original olive green that we went in
with so using that same Sigma e45 I'm
going to pack that mainly on the outer
corner you can put on the inner corner
if you want as well but I really wanted
to concentrate it on the outer corner
and then again I will go in with a
little bit more of uninterrupted on the
brush and blend that out cuz we really
want to keep the Greens low because if
you bring them up too high on the lid
that's when it can start to look like a
little bit like a bruise and we know
that a bruised eye is not cute on
anybody so now we are going to be going
in with a foiled eyeshadow by makeup
geek and this is in the shade jester and
I have recently fallen in love with this
color and it is a really beautiful olive
green with some gold reflex in it and so
I am using a Mac 242 brush to apply this
it's a synthetic flat brush so any
synthetic flat brush will work for this
and I'm gonna focus this color mainly on
the center of the lid and then blend out
to the sides and I'm initially going in
with this drive I will spritz my brush
in a moment with some mac fix+ if you
don't have fix plus you can use eye
drops and that will work pretty much
just the same I'm going to make sure I
really focus that wet brush right on the
center of the lid to get a really nice
metallic sheen this is a great trick if
you want to make your eyes look bigger
and around
so if you have small eyes this would be
a great tip for you with any shadows any
colors to really make sure you
concentrate the color in the center of
the eye and then I was taking a little
bit more of that initial olive green and
popping it in the inner corner because I
felt like gesture was kind of
overpowering it and I didn't want to
lose that inner corner depth darkness
that we had now I'm going to fill in my
brows basic we've seen this a million
times before
and I actually ran out of my color and
the Anastasia brow is right as I went to
apply it and you know that moment we
were just like no my brows shed a quick
tear and move on so I'm actually using a
color from my back sock that is not my
right shade but we're just going to see
past that right we can pass it once the
look is done it's fine it looks a little
weird now but it'll be fine so I am
using Mac nylon as my brow highlight
today because this is my favorite brow
highlight ever it has like a nice yellow
sheen to it and it is frosty as can be
so it lasts you forever because the
tiniest bit goes such a long way so I'm
going to put that right on the top of
the brow bone blend out a little bit and
we're going to move on to the lower lash
line so I'm going in initially with
enchanted forest which is that super
super dark green I'm going to apply that
only on the outer half of the eye and
now I'm going to do is I'm going to go
in with the lighter green which is dirty
martini and I'm going to put that on the
inner half of my eye so it's almost like
an ombre effect and we have the darker
color in the outer corner because we did
the same thing on the upper lid
we put enchanted forest that dark green
on the outer and we left the inner
corner with just dirty martini so I kind
of wanted to have that same effect of
kind of an ombre under eye and then
using a pencil brush I'm going to grab a
little bit of that Mac uninterupted and
just begin to blend it out because I
never want harsh lines on the under eye
area I always want it to have the same
effect as the upper lid so I like to
make sure that it's really nice and
smoky and blown out that's why we go in
with a pencil brush and a lighter color
now I'm going to go in with the Mac
chroma graphic pencil and nc15 slash
nw20 which is just an amazing cream
liner and it doesn't bother my eyes so
my eyes are very sensitive and it's
going to line my waterline to really
make my eyes stand out especially since
I have blue / green eyes my eye color
can easily get lost with this makeup
look so this trip this trick will make
my eye color kind of stand out and not
get lost with all the other green
tones then I'm just popping a little bit
of nylon highlight on the inner corner
as well to match the brow bone because
the inner highlight is something I can't
skip and then I'm gonna go in with the
Laurier Laurier Laura Mercier
translucent setting powder and I'm going
to be using an III brush from morphe
just to dust this over my entire face
this is a trick that I do to make my
bronzer or my contour my blush my
highlight just go on very very smooth so
it's not patchy at all then I'm gonna go
in with oh my gosh you guys these lashes
these are the new lashes by velour
lashes and they are sold exclusively at
Sephora and I actually think they're
launching today but they sent them to me
early and this is the style fluff and
wispy a whole my gosh they are probably
one of my fate actually they are my
favourite lashes I've ever used before
so I'll try to find it and link it down
below for you guys if they are available
they're very dramatic but they are
amazing and I'm gonna coat my lower
lashes with some mascara I use Mac
extended play lash because my favorite
lower lash mascara along with the Rimmel
lash accelerator and then I'm going to
bronze my face using Bobby Brown bronzer
I believe this is in golden one golden
light one maybe and I am using one of my
favorite contour brushes at the moment
this is the morphe 5 to 3 brush I don't
know what it was technically made for
but I've been using it for contour and I
absolutely love it cuz it gives a really
easy kind of soft contour much softer
than like the NARS eita brush which I
love as well
but this one I just feel like a softer
and easier and not as harsh and I don't
know I go through moments where I want
really harsh contours and then softer
ones speaking of a harsh contour I'm
going to take just a little bit of that
Laura Mercier translucent powder and I'm
going to use a really intense angled
brush from morphe this is the 4 5 9 and
I'm going to let that sit there for a
few minutes and I'm going to just dust
it off and I of course and setting my
brows I'm using Anastasia clear brow gel
aka brow super glue more like gorilla
glue because this stuff does not move
and then I'm gonna go in with a blush
from the morphe 9b palette I still love
this palette guys it's so good I'm going
to use this blush this coral the top
right corner it has a little bit of
Sheen in it but it's not sparkly or
glittery I'm going to apply that to the
apples of the cheeks and I'm going to
really bring it backward towards the
cheekbones recently I've been into
applying blush a little bit further back
I feel like it pulls the face back a
little bit more than putting it just on
the apples of the cheeks I'm thinking
about doing an in-depth video about
blush contour baking highlights so let
me know if you guys want to see that
video and I'd be happy to do it for you
and I'm going to just dust off that bake
that we had sitting there that sounds so
funny oh my gosh help me and then I'm
going to apply champagne pop to my
cheekbones using a morphe M 501 brush I
get asked all the time of my favorite
brushes for a highlight and it's
hands-down the m500 one I absolutely
love it I've been using it for months
and it is my fave and I am going over
with a second highlight because I'm just
feeling you know sassy today I'm gonna
pop some on my cupid bow and then I'm
going to take a little bit of that same
bronzer I used to contour and just
shadow my lower lip just to give a
little bit more of a lower fuller lip
effects even though my top lip needs the
fullness let's get real not my bottom
but let's move on for lipstick i'm gonna
be using house of dolls pretty MF and as
you can see it's like a really really
light orange kind of creamsicle and I
don't love the way this looks on my
skintone personally maybe I'm just not
used to seeing myself in it but I wanted
to go over it to kind of manipulate the
color a little bit so I'm gonna go in
with a NYX butter gloss this is an oldie
but a goodie and the shade maple blondie
and I feel like these two colors mixed
together are just like my dream come
true for a Thanksgiving lip I just think
it looks like a creamsicle creamy
pumpkin pie I just love the shade that
these two make together and it's nice
and glossy and I just love a glossy lip
so after we have that we're just going
to set everything by using Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray we use any
setting spray you want or you can just
be ballsy and not use any setting spray
all mad respect to you and that's the
end so I hope you guys enjoy happy
Thanksgiving from my family to yours I
love you guys so much and I'll see you
soon mmm hi guys
