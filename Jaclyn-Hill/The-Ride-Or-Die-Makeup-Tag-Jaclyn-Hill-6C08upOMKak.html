excited to be filming this like this is
the sign I've been to some video in a
long time truthfully because I am going
to be creating a tag today as you can
see by the title I'm calling it the
ride-or-die tag thank you to my
subscribers for helping me come up with
this name the purpose of today's video
is to find out people's ride-or-die
cosmetic products from each category so
I'm going to be telling you my number
one favorite foundation my number one
favorite blush mascara lip products like
number one of all-time rider dye
basically if you're going to a desert
island you could only bring one of each
what it would be it's a challenge more
than anything it was so hard to pick out
my ride or dies some things it was like
Grenada without a question I just knew I
just walked my makeup girl and pulled
out other things like I've been making
this list for a week in my phone like
trying to really think like what is
truly my ride-or-die like it's a
challenge so I'm excited to see what
your Ryder diet products are and I'm
super excited to see what other
youtubers ride-or-die products are
exactly like every month it's a new
foundation it's a new eyeshadow palette
it's a new this and that and every month
I'm always I think if I ever got baked
and I'm like what is it really though
because it's like you just get so caught
up in the excitement so I want to know
everyone's true ride-or-die products
like if you were on a desert island
I'm sure this tag has been done before
in some way or the other I couldn't find
it but I'm sure that this is not an
original idea obviously um but I could
not find anything so I'm calling it the
rider dye tag I tag all of you I can't
wait to see your ride-or-die products
I'm going to go ahead and list the
questions down below in the bottom bar
if you guys want to add anything any
totally can make this challenge this tag
your own so let's get started it oh and
yes to address the elephant in the room
hi I do obviously have a wig on I woke
up in my hair I was like oh wait I was
not feeling it it was you know my roots
were growing out my hair is looking dull
not to mention I got a haircut last week
though I'm not too happy with and I need
to get it texturized later this week so
what do you do you found a wig make it
work
alright so let's get started because I
swear my air conditioning is not working
today and I literally have sweat just
all over my body thank God you can't see
it so the first writer dye product is a
face primer I kind of wanted to start
and go in order so for
me my ride-or-die no matter what I know
this primer is going to do exactly what
I'm looking for
that is the Becca I'm in order call be
backup backlight priming a filter this
is the second no I think this is the
third bottle I might be wrong with our
choice at the third bottle all I know is
I've never used a primer as much as I've
used this one I absolutely love it I
will say that it does not smooth out
your skin it does not fill in pores or
fine lines but it is super hydrating and
moisturizing and when you apply
foundation over top of it it just makes
your skin look dewy and healthy if
you're looking for radiance and if
you're looking for just something for
your foundation to stick to it for a
glow this would be a great primer for
you that's why I personally love it so
much for foundation this one was the
hardest hands down the hardest category
for me i sat on this for several days
because there's like five foundations
girls that wait know that so I know that
so what do you think is going to be what
do you think I feel like tons of you
guys are going to guess
Giorgio Armani we want to sell
foundation right wrong that was so annoy
okay I chose the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD stick foundation this to me is the
best foundation ever I always know what
I'm going to get with it I always know
the payoff the coverage the way it's
going to wear I feel like it's weird
because sometimes I can use a foundation
for five months and love it so much and
then go back to it a couple months later
and I'm like why is this not working the
way I remember it working why is this
kind of breaking up on my skin why is it
not blending the way I want it to this
never fails me now it's weird because
this foundation hasn't even been out for
that long it hasn't have been out for a
year I don't think and I'm already
making this my ride-or-die number one
foundation in the whole world like if I
was on a desert island and I could only
bring one it would be this guy right
here it's just so beautiful it's a
natural finish it's got a little bit of
a satin dewy finish to it it lasts for
so long it doesn't break up it's so easy
to blend out it's a medium to full
coverage it's very buildable I swear
it's like it's just my perfect
foundation so next for concealer this is
actually it was easy yes but at the same
time I kind of struggled because I was
like should I think about mac
prolongwear because that that concealer
lasted for a longer period than any
other concealer has ever last
I mean um but I'm going to have to go
with the Urban Decay weightless complete
coverage naked concealer this is just my
absolute number one concealer ever it's
just such a beautiful coverage it's not
too drying it's not too dewy it's right
in between it's not too like I don't use
the word moist but it's just perfect it
blends out so easy like I've been
playing with a lot of different
concealers recently I've noticed some
concealers I absolutely love once I
apply them but they're so difficult to
get them to apply because you'd go over
like a million times and it just doesn't
want to blend out this one blends out so
simple it's just like the all-around
perfect concealer I absolutely love it
it's a medium to full coverage and it's
very very buildable right so now to set
the entire face we're going to go in
with our ride-or-die face powder
this always very hard for me because I
went between two back and forth back and
forth back and forth seriously it's like
this is the most first world problems of
all time the fact that I'm staying there
like oh god what face powder do I choose
like huh but after going back and forth
for quite a while I landed on a Giorgio
Armani a luminous silk powder foundation
because I just feel like it's I don't
know like I love the Mac mineralized
skinfinish so much because I like a face
powder that is a very sheer maybe medium
covered I don't like a full coverage
powder because then it makes me to max
and because I'm more on the dry side
throughout the day I will look very
cakey if I use a full coverage powder
over top of a foundation um so I want
something that just kind of kind of set
my face keep everything in place that
rhyme but not the additional coverage
just make my skin look nice and flawless
um so I did choose this one but I will
say that I was so neck to neck with the
Mac mineralize skinfinish I just feel
like ever since I bought this one I'm
always constantly using this one more
actually just bought a brand new one
because I completely ran out the first
one that I bought so and this one is
even matched me right now because I'm so
so fair like I'm the whitest I've ever
been this is the widest that my body
gets I do not get whiter than this this
was me Niles take it really good
so I wanted to do a ride-or-die under
eye setting powder because a couple of
years ago I have always set my under
eyes
under Isis I first got a job at math
when I was 18 years old and I remember
no one else set their eyes like none of
the other artists they're freelancers
clients didn't want to set their under
eyes I was like how come no one is doing
this um but I feel like now everyone
sets their under eyes thank you Jesus
because now everyone is on board and I
really want to know everyone's favorite
under eye setting powder which is why I
included this in the tag because I'm
very curious I'm always looking for new
under eye setting powders but I will say
my ride-or-die is actually the RCM a no
color transfer scent powder
thank you to kathleenlights for making
me aware of this months and months and
months ago as you can see I'm quite a
fan it's almost empty I need to get
another one the only thing I like about
this is the packaging man like I want to
change it so bad I have it like taped
right here and I just open it up and
dump it in the cap that's how I use it
but uh this is the best tranches of
powder I've ever used I set my under eye
with a damn do deep sponge and that is
just my number one favorite way I always
know the results I'm going to get it
makes it so airbrushed and just flat and
matte and smooth I absolutely love using
the Mac Pro emphasize and the Anastacio
banana powder but I will say as I get
older and I get little tiny fine lines
under there I do see that it kind of
emphasizes those lines especially
throughout the day or if I have texture
in here it will emphasize that texture
where is this does not this actually
helps hide the fine lines of the texture
so that's why this boy is my rod
oh look so now we're going to go for
bronzer blush and highlight and for my
ride-or-die bronzer I actually chose the
a mac cosmetics studio care blend
pressed powder which is kind of weird
cuz this is not even technically a
bronzer but I have used it as a bronzer
for years ever since Mac came out with
this powder when I was working there and
it's my ride-or-die I don't use it that
often
but if I have to just grab something and
it's one thing and I know how it's going
to work and I I know the results I'm
looking for it is the studio care blend
pressed powder I do use the shade dark
it looks like this right here it's what
I use today on my face I use all these
products today I was like since I'm
gonna be talking about it I might as
well use it that's not about this
challenge and that's why I'm excited to
see other people do it because I want to
know like your absolute favorite even if
it's something even touched in years but
like you know it's just that mmm it's
just that go to my ride-or-die
this one was the easiest when I went
through my list I got to blush all the
Coon I didn't have to think about it
hands down it is Mac Melba oh my gosh it
is my favorite blush ever it is a matte
blush I'm looking at the mirror oh my
gosh it's so pretty it's like a pale
kind of warm
corely pinky peachy kind of blush it is
just so pretty it's not too light it's
not too dark when I worked at Mac this
is the blush that I would use on like
everyone Mac has great pigmentation
their blushes it's just beautiful
like it's one of those blushes you can
put on with any look basically and it's
going to work like it's just gorgeous
it's my number one okay so now for my
ride-or-die highlight you guys obviously
know what highlight I'm gonna pick it
would be weird if I didn't pick
champagne pop hello this is hands-down
my ride-or-die and I don't just say that
because the fact that I was responsible
for the shade of champagne pop I say
that because I loved highlighters but
champagne pop was something that I got
to envision and I got to create and I
got to see come to life and I got to
make my favorite highlighter you know
I'm saying I went through so many
samples until I got to this one right
here and I was like this is it this is
the highlighter that I've always wanted
I had never seen a highlighter that had
this peachy champagne undertone that I
was searching for and that is why it's
my ride-or-die
I love it so much it never fails me I
will go through all different highlights
but I always always always go back to
champagne pop but just my number one
it's my baby it's gonna hold a place in
my heart for the rest of my life
champagne pop has just been amazing to
me so but since I helped create
champagne pop I felt like it would only
be fair if I added a second highlighter
you know for those of you who are like
we've heard and have about champagne pop
my second favorite ride-or-die highlight
which is we're excited have not even
mentioned this on youtube yet I mention
this on snapchat
um months and months ago and so many
people start talking about it on YouTube
but I was like I don't even need to
mention it everyone's else is talking
about it um but I'll mention it here for
the first time this is the sleek makeup
highlight in the called the highlighting
palette Souls these salties solstice I
don't even know how to pronounce that
these two highlights right here are
absolutely gorge wah
they're like the most pigmented I swear
it is the most
print just like blinding the formula is
beautiful it's creamy it's not glittery
it's not chunky it doesn't fall off the
skin it's so stinkin pigmented and then
there's this beautiful lavender one that
I've only used once and there's a cream
one that I've never touched um but this
is just so beautiful and it's
inexpensive too but that is my second
ride-or-die all right so moving on to
eyes I want to talk about eyelashes for
this I truly could not pick one I tried
so hard I even did the eenie meenie
miney moe catch a time you're back and
forth I couldn't pick one so I have two
and they're like equally tied and the
first one are the flutter slave
eyelashes oh do you hear the Thunder God
knows he knows how I feel about my slave
lows thank you thank you Lord they look
like this so they are drama llama but
they are hands-down the most comfortable
false lashes I have ever worn I got
online I bought 10 pairs of these and I
thought I used my last pair of I found
these it's like the very back of one of
my lash - I smells like thank you Jesus
and then for my favorite more natural
lashes which are still going to be
dramatic because I know that like my
version of a natural lash is not other
people's version but it would have to be
wispy sweet nothings buyable lower
lashes these are just so beautiful you
can see how much more natural they look
compared to the sleigh lows they're
shorter they're fluffier they're more
separated if I'm going for a look where
I'm just putting on false lashes you
know some foundation and a gloss just
super simple these will be the lashes I
choose for my more natural lash they're
so pretty
or just simplistic if you have really
small eyes these are going to probably
be a little bit too dramatic for your
liking unless you're looking for a
dramatic lash but they are absolutely
beautiful I just love them so much so
slay 'la and with these sweet nothings
so now for my ride-or-die mascara this
one was fairly easy but I did kind of go
back and forth between this one and the
Tarte lights camera lashes I love that
one but this one definitely one and it
is the l'oreal voluminous carbon black
now carbon black this is the shade you
can get it in brown black or carbon
black but carbon black is like black as
my soul it's just got such a good brush
I am never without the L'Oreal mascara I
always always have to have a tube in my
little like vanity right there where I
do my makeup because it's just my
favorite it just makes my lashes look
really nice and fluffy and natural but I
can be like if I want to get it like
clumpy and we're really really
voluminous I can't like I just love it
it's my favorite mascara I would choose
this more than Chanel more than YSL more
than Dior like this is my ride-or-die so
I went back and forth on the whole eye
shadow things I wanted to include
eyeshadows of course but I was like I
can't just say like my ride-or-die eyes
shadow like I don't just have one eye
shadow like I'm hooked up with a look so
I decided to do your ride-or-die
eyeshadow palette because there's so
many palettes out there in the cosmetic
industry more than like ever before so I
wanted to see everyone's favorite
eyeshadow palettes out there if you
could only choose one so I feel like
it'll be really interesting for me this
was slightly difficult but as you know
if you watch my channel I do not use
palettes very often I'm kind of iffy
about it so I'm going to go with one
that's pretty typical for me but it's
the honest truth you guys have seen me
use this more than any other palette for
sure and it is the morphe 3/5 oh I kind
of went back and forth between this and
the Kat Von D shade and light palette
because the shade and light palette is
so beautiful but the shade and light
palette does not have the orange and the
red the mama needs in her life so I'll
be honest I basically do not use these
three rows I just use these four right
here except this one and use this one
several times but other than that I
don't even use these like this right
here is my palette in this section but I
go back to these constantly on a daily
basis when I do my makeup I gratis on my
drawer constantly I use this creamsicle
color right here this orange color this
ready one this like kinda reminds me of
Mac Swiss chocolate this is just my
ride-or-die paddle if I could only
choose one because honestly I just love
warm shadows more than anything else
like that's all I'm asking for and I was
not on YouTube and I didn't have to
change it up for makeup tutorials I
would be the girl that every single day
had on a warm smoky eye that's just how
I would do things and I think
it's pretty obvious okay so now for lips
we're gonna do lipstick liquid them and
lip gloss because Heather want to cover
all the bases because I'm a lip product
junkie monkey I am always a nude girl
when it comes to lipsticks especially I
want a nude nude nude I rock it old
school I know that everyone loves like
these dark colors like I'm wearing right
now I like them too but on a daily basis
mm-hmm I like to keep it nude that's
just how I do so my hands down
Ryder dining lipstick is blush nude by
Tom Ford I've been talking about this a
lot recently but this is just mmm
perfection I always know what I'm going
to get it is the perfect nude it's
creamy it's got beautiful pigment like
it's just the ball it's amazing it's not
too pink because I don't like nudes
they're too pink
I don't like news that have that
brownish gray undertone it's perfect it
is my perfect pinky nude without too
much pink I love it so much it is so
expensive it is ridiculous how expensive
it is okay so for liquid lip this one
was the easiest for the lip products for
sure because this is just my favorite
liquid lip ride-or-die hands-down and it
is the Kat Von D Lolita liquid lip now
there is a Lolita too but I still like
the number one the original it's always
been difficult to find it's always sold
out everywhere for good reasons I've
talked about it several times how much I
love it this is my second tube the first
one I got it pretty much empty I just
loved it I wore it constantly last fall
and winter I like her packaging I was
like a skinny a long stick the only
thing I will say but that color is bomb
that's a bomb color um the only thing I
will say is it can be patchy I feel like
um a lot of her liquid lips can be
patchy it doesn't bother me though
because I'm not like over here to judge
I just like the color so you have to
kind of go over certain spots a couple
of times but once it's on it's on you
are good to go and it's just such a
beautiful color so for a ride-or-die lip
gloss hands-down you guys are ready
gonna know I was gonna try to switch it
up though because I was like there's
other lip glosses that I love so much
but no hands down this is my ride-or-die
lip gloss for life this is the Marc
Jacobs sugar sugar lip gloss it is just
the most beautiful pick
said nude but it's not too pigmented I
swear to God
it was the smell like so good it's like
the most perfect minty fresh scent I
swear this formula is just gold its lip
gloss gold because it's pigmented but
it's not too pigmented and it's got the
sheer beautiful kind of wet looking
glassy look but it's not too sheer
like it can be worn alone Oh or over a
lipstick it's just I swear it's just my
favorite lipstick I'm sorry the gloss
formula ever and sugar sugar is my
favorite color ever it's just perfect
so I have two products left and right
before I left the house to come film
this video my sister looked over my list
and she was like you don't have a
setting spray on here and I was like oh
my god how could I forget so I ran back
in and I grabbed my ride-or-die at
setting spray and that is for sure the
Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray
and love this because it's cooling it's
hydrating I love this because of the
fact that I am dry so I'm not looking
for something to hold or combat oil you
know I'm just looking for something to
make me look a little bit more hydrated
my makeup look a little bit more natural
mix the power the foundation you know
how that goes so I would have to say
chill for sure so for my very last
ride-or-die product I honestly add this
in here just because I'm nosy and I want
to know everyone else is like
ride-or-die
favorite perfume of all time so that's
why I added this in kind of in it works
with Beauty right perfumes maker it
works so my favorite writer diaper team
of all time is misty or blooming bouquet
I absolutely love the scent a lot of you
but I thought that was in the same Marc
Jacobs Daisy because I've talked about
it so many times because of the fact
that it's the scent that I wore my
wedding day but I honestly don't to
spray it that often because I love the
memories that it holds so I don't like
to overdo it
whereas misty or blooming bouquet I
think this is the third bottle I've been
through I've never purchased more
bottles of any perfume in my life that I
have this one I use it all the time and
I never get sick of it
the perfect amount of floral and girly
and yet mature and sexy at the same time
it's just so good
I read you guys that completes this
ride-or-die tag I kind of want to make
it like a rider dye challenge was
honestly it is really challenging
especially if you're like a makeup lover
to pick out like your number one of all
time so I'm super eager to see all of
your rider dye products and again if you
want to add in like for instance I
didn't do eyeliner just because I don't
know I just didn't feel like it was
necessary for the challenge of the tag
but if you guys want to add in like your
ride or die eyeliner or any other
products please feel free to add in make
it your own comment down below if you
want to see other youtubers do this go
out there and tag them and let them know
that you want to see them do this video
and yeah that's it I love you guys so
much thank you for watching the
ride-or-die tag and I will see you guys
in my next video bye I've been looking
forward to this for a long while
