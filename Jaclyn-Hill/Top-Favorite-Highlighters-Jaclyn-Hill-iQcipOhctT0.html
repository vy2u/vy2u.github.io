subscribers okay seriously though when I
say we I mean that because this does not
feel like I've done it on my own I don't
feel like I reached a million I
honest-to-god just feel so thankful the
word thankful does not even mean
anything because it's like there needs
to be another word and then to describe
the way I'm feeling at this moment never
my wildest dreams and I ever think that
anything like this would happen to me
just me like I was nobody I mean like
I'm not trying to put myself down but
like let's get real like I just I was a
makeup artist at MAC Cosmetics and I
love doing makeup and I started doing
YouTube videos two years ago in a very
dark time of my life on a camera that
claim to be HD that was $45 and two
years later
1 million people have subscribed to my
channel and I'm just I'm blown away and
I know like so many people say this and
you're like yeah but honestly like
dreams do come true I am NOT Britney
Spears or Christina Aguilera but this
was my dream to be a makeup artist that
can inspire people and encourage people
and teach them makeup artistry and make
them feel beautiful inside and out
because makeup is just like a universal
language and every time a girl even it's
like oh yeah I don't really like makeup
when they put it on they feel this inner
confidence and they just they feel
empowered and they just feel like yes I
can take on the world and I just I love
the power behind makeup and that's why I
started this channel and I never in my
wildest dreams thought that it would
come to this and it is all because of
you guys and your love and your support
and I am so thankful like I'm not gonna
cry again thank you for your love thank
you for your support thank you for
everything just thank you thank you
thank you thank you times a million
literally thank you so 1 million cyber
hugs I love you guys so much thank you
you really just feel like such good
friends to me and family and I just I
love you I love you and I'm grateful for
you and I appreciate you and you matter
to me so thank you so much ok let's get
into the video ok so today's video is
going to be my top slash favorite
highlighters I'd only go from calling
this yet obvious
all I do know is that I did do a blush
video about a month and a half ago and a
lot of you guys were asking me if I
could do like my favorite highlighter
it's my favorite eye shadows my favorite
Mac shadows makeup geek shadows
lipsticks lip glosses you get the gist
anyways so I am like highlighter
obsessed
I'd love a good highlight so I thought I
would start off with highlighters if you
guys want me to continue doing videos
like this I like my favorite or top
products of a certain category give this
video a thumbs up and leave me a comment
down below letting me know what is it
you would like to see exactly because I
can totally do that for you so today I'm
going to be doing highlighters obviously
and I'm going to be mentioning products
I have used not only on myself but on
clients as well so all different skin
tones all different textures all
different races all of our ages and I'll
let you know which ones I love
personally for my skin tone and things
around my skin tone and lighter and
darker so kind of like a range of it all
does that make sense okay let's move on
I'm not going to talk about highlighters
that you can currently purchase because
when I was picking out highlighters
there were probably like 17 that I was
like this is my Holy Grail no this is my
Holy Grail and as I was doing that I was
like oh they're all limited edition
thanks Mac so the first products I'm
going to start off with are just
obviously they need to be spoken about I
was going to get them out of the way
right now because if you watch my
channel you know this is coming it is
the Becca shimmering skin Perfector in
the shade opal this is like hands-down
right now my top favorite highlighter of
light it is so absolutely beautiful I
cannot deal with it this is ideal for
someone with my skin tone and darker if
you're super super fair you're probably
gonna want to go with the next one that
I'm about to show you this is an amazing
dupe for Mac whisper of guilt which was
an extreme dimension skin finish or
something like that I don't know I don't
work for them anymore I don't have to
know whisper of guilt is a very popular
highlighter in the makeup world and this
is a beautiful dupe it's absolutely
gorgeous if you are lighter I would go
with the shade moonstone this is the
exact same product is the one before
it's just a lighter more vanilla base
this is such a beautiful neutral
highlighter if you don't really want to
look like ronzi or play up that glow
like you would with opal
moonstone is going to be your best
friend it is just absolutely beautiful I
love this so
again so creamy it's when the creamiest
highlighters I've ever worked with I
just love these this is the Laura
Mercier matte radiance baked powder and
highlight zero one it's not matte I
don't know why it says that but it's
just not this highlight is absolutely
gorgeous I'm going to say that about
every single highlighter just because
these are at my absolute favorites and I
just love them but this one in
particular is just so beautiful because
it is so Universal someone who is
extremely fair to someone who is pretty
dark who has a nice tan can wear this
highlighter it is not too gold it is not
too bronze and it is not too white what
I love about this is that it's not a
crazy crazy crazy over pigmented
highlighter if you want to make this
like thing you really can't get this
intense but just initially going in with
the brush and dusting it on the
cheekbones it's not going to be
overwhelming or overpowering so if you
like a really light natural-looking
highlight this is gonna be your best
friend
this is from Victoria's Secret and this
is called the illuminating face powder
in the shade fixation this is probably
so random for those of you who watch my
videos all the time because I've never
mentioned this on camera but I've owned
it for over a year and more than using
it on myself I've use this on clients my
friend was wearing it one time and I
literally was like yes and on my break
walked Victoria's Secret and bought this
because it's just so beautiful it
reminds me a lot of the Laura Mercier
highlighter the difference is this one
has a little bit more pink in it and a
little bit more white but it's very
similar with the way that it applies I
love this highlighter my friend who
wears this is about one shade lighter
than me in skin tone but she's very
yellow and this just looks beautiful on
her it's not too pink and it's not too
white it's a mixture of both and it is
just absolutely beautiful it looks so
angelic on the cheekbones it's just it's
gorgeous it's a great little highlight I
love that it's small easy to throw in
your purse ready to go this is a
Smashbox soft lights in the shade
shimmer it has like a twist cap that
comes off like a lot of Smashbox
products this is a very different
highlighter for me because this is
mainly a pink dusty rosy undertone but
yet it still works as a highlight so my
favorite way to wear this highlighter is
actually over top of my blush sweeping
upward towards the cheekbone you can
totally wear this as just a
my lighter right here on the top of the
cheek I just love wearing it over blush
because I think that it really makes the
whole cheek area pop this is just so
pretty it's different it's not like the
other since it does have that pink rose
undertone in it especially on girl with
a tan if you don't want to play up like
that bronze yellowy highlight and said
you want to go with like a pinky glow
this is just absolutely beautiful mary
lou manizer by the balm i have mentioned
this ever since i think i started my
youtube channel pretty much this is one
of the best highlighters in the world
this is like the third one now that I've
had that it just falls out I have to
super glue them in constantly which is
kind of funny not a big deal I've gone
through so many of these because when I
freelanced this was pretty much my go-to
highlighter that I just slapped on
everybody because it's so easy and if
you are a freelance makeup artist this
is a great highlighter to own because
you can literally use the time the mo
and highlight pretty much the entire
face because it is so crazy pigmented
there's honestly not much to say about
this highlighter other than it's
absolutely amazing if you are into to a
highlight this is like the first one I
recommend to you it is so Universal it's
just that perfect vanilla shade it is
pigmented as can be like there's nothing
more pigmented than this highlighter
right here it's gorgeous if you like an
intense highlight you will get it if you
like a really soft more natural
highlight just go very very light hand
with your brush this is just absolutely
beautiful and one of my all-time
favorites the next highlight is called
global glow this is by MAC Cosmetics
they just got done revamping their
packaging for the mineralized skinfinish
is can I love it I think it's so much
better and it's very sleek the great
thing that I love about Mac's mineralize
skinfinish is is this is not the only
way it can be worn which most products
can be worn in many different ways let's
get real it's makeup with this product
you can get it wet you can use it as an
eyeshadow you can make it more metallic
you can get your blush brush wet and
dust it on your cheekbones with your wet
brush I know it sounds crazy and it'll
give you like the most beautiful
metallic almost like your cheeks are wet
it is amazing if you are going to do the
whole wet thing make sure that you use
either like mac's fix+
or some sort of hydrating mist or facial
spray or even eye drops because water
sometimes can break these products up
and not
make it apply with as much pigment it'll
kind of just work off your face
so especially something with glycerin
which is why I recommend mac fix+ is
ideal to apply these wet if you use mac
fix+ and then go with this on your brush
as an eyeshadow o globo glow has like a
gold river running through it along with
like a bronze eBay g base so it's not
too much of anything it's not too much
bronze too much gold it's just perfect
this is only going to be a highlight on
the cheekbones for someone who is much
darker than me this is Mac soft and
gentle this is the old packaging before
they just got done revamping it this is
an oldie but a goodie for me this is a
more pinky neutral highlight with gold
flecks in it the gold flecks in it are
not glitter they're not chunky but there
are gold flecks
I can't I'm to be someone who only likes
a highlight that is just nothing but
just smooth and creamy and I don't want
any flex or any glitter in it I just
want it to be so airbrush and just like
perfect is that so much to ask
perfect this one does have a little bit
of flex in it but it's done in a very
beautiful way and it's really nice
because it makes it much more Universal
since it's like a pink base B it has
gold in it it makes it very neutral for
a lot of skin tones to use it is
absolutely beautiful
this is seal as all over what is this
all over shimmer duo in the shade kitten
first of all the kitten eye shadow don't
even get me started I have used that a
million times to highlight and that is
amazing I should have included that this
is such a fun product because first of
all its small its compact it can go
anywhere with you
and on one side you have a pink
highlight and on another side you have a
bronzy highlight I personally love
mixing them together because I think
it's just absolutely beautiful but I
love that it's so tiny and you get two
highlighters and one I definitely went
through a fight phase fad phase where I
was obsessed with this pink highlight I
was wearing it constantly like a month
or two straight but they're gorgeous I
love it because you can use this one
where you're fair and use this one in
the summer they're both equally
beautiful they're very pigmented I love
them I just I love how cute and tiny
this is I think it's a great idea this
is totally random but I'm going to
mention an eyeshadow this is nylon by
Mac I have to mention this because even
though it's a show
no it is just such a beautiful highlight
and if you want something they can go
everywhere with you or you can put in a
little Z palette this is your guy nylon
is just so beautiful it is in tents so
just watch out like one little swipe and
it's like boom in your face it will
light you up like a disco ball but when
I was working at Mac I would use this on
girls who liked an intense highlight I
would also use this on girls who are
very fair and I would also use this on
girls who have a lot of yellow and all
of their skin tones so very olive
complexions just a lot of yellow a lot
of people have very yellow skin and
things can be kind of difficult for them
because foundations and highlighters and
blushes I have something in my eye can
all be very pink and just not work so
this is just a beautiful highlight if
you have yellow in your skin it's
gorgeous
again it's intense so make sure that
when you go in with it you are just like
literally is all you need just barely
touch it and that's all you need this is
beautiful as a brow highlight inner
corner highlight keep it bow highlight
cheek highlight it's just like all
around a perfect highlight and it is
nylon eyeshadow by Mac this is my
favorite drugstore highlighter to me
personally it's very hard to find a good
highlighter at the drugstore
I've tried tons of them and for some
reason they always used they always seem
to be very chalky very dusty and you'll
get tons of it on your hand and like
your brush and try to apply it and just
kind of Falls and it's very sad so this
is my favorite it doesn't do that this
is by the brand hard candy it is called
Tiki it is referred to as a baked
bronzer it's not a bronzer it's a
highlight it's absolutely beautiful
it had it's predominantly a gold baiji
tone in it this is so pretty though it
really is it's not like the best
highlighter in the world but if you're a
girl on a budget and you're trying to
find something at the drugstore this is
going to be your best friend it is so
pretty I went through a phase with this
as well where I was using it constantly
but honestly the ingredients in it just
they can tend to irritate my skin which
is why I don't grab this as often as I
would like to because it is so pretty
but I just I'm an ingredient girl I have
an issue with ingredients I just have
the most sensitive skin in the world and
I have to be careful this highlighter is
from the drugstore as well this is by
Physicians Formula
and it is the powder palate mineral
pearls in the shade beige pearl I've
heard some negative things about this
product and I have to just be honest for
me I have not had like any issues like
I've seen some other reviews say maybe I
just got like a randomly good product I
don't know the only thing about this
product is it is very sheer
you really have to pack it on it's not
going to be really intense it's not
going to give you a very thing highlight
on the cheekbone it's going to be a very
sheer wash of highlight which can be
ideal for some people so if you're
someone who just wants a little bit of a
highlight this is ideal for you it's a
very neutralized highlight it's not too
light it's not too dark so it's going to
work on a wide range of skin tones we
are almost at the finish line people
this is NARS albatross I have not talked
about this and so long but I used to be
obsessed with this highlighter this is a
very yellow gold based highlighter it is
very pretty it almost looks green
honestly when you're looking at it like
this it is so pretty
on someone who has a bit of a tan
especially if you are a yellow base and
skin oh my gosh it is so so pretty but
this is very yellowy this is not neutral
this is not bronze this is a yellow
highlight so just be aware of that it is
beautiful beautiful
I used to absolutely love it when I had
a little bit more color in my skin but
it is yellow just no but it's absolutely
gorgeous last but not least is a pigment
from Mac this is called melon I can't
okay there's like fuzzies everywhere in
the air I can't even tell you how
obsessed I was with this pigment I
literally use this as my highlight on my
cheekbones every single day for probably
a year and what's crazy is it literally
looks untouched it is ideal for
summertime I deal with somebody who has
a little bit of a tan and mixing this in
with your foundation in the summer is so
beautiful oh but this is not going to
work on somebody who's extremely fair as
a cheekbone highlight again you can use
anything over your blush any of these if
you purchase a highlight and you're like
this is too dark like it looks pink on
my cheekbone it looks too brown on my
cheekbone it looks dusty on my cheekbone
you put that maybe over a blush and it's
going to work it's just going to be a
highlight a little bit lower on the
cheeks which kind of makes you look like
you've a natural glow as opposed to
highlighting hi
on the cheek because there is definitely
a difference between highlighting on the
top of the cheekbone and then making a
glow on the cheeks does that make sense
you guys are probably like um what that
completes my favorite highlighters well
at least my favorite powder highlighters
because I do have liquid highlighters
and Luminizer as well but we weren't
going to get into that it's a little
much so yes I hope that you guys enjoy
