video I just want to quickly talk about
the fact that I've not been here on
YouTube for an entire week maybe none of
you noticed but it's been very weird for
me and I honestly have not enjoyed this
time off whatsoever I have hated not
filming videos I've hated not being here
with you guys it's been really weird it
was just the busiest week ever my
birthday was yesterday on July 20th and
thank you so much to all of you who wish
me happy birthday and sent me photos and
collages it was so awesome I love you
guys so much um Mike and Mike came into
town to celebrate my birthday with me my
sister is actually still staying here at
my house right now and I was like hold
what I have to film so it's just been a
very busy week and then not to mention
my twitter was hacked earlier this
weekend and so much I love my Twitter
until it was stolen from me because that
is where I interact with you guys than
most I tweet you guys every single day
and keep you updated on what I'm feeling
filming when I'm uploading all that jazz
so it's been really weird not only am I
not filmed in a week we're not having
Twitter this weekend I'm like I feel
like so naked like just weird I'm not
talking to you guys I feel very
disconnected so makes me feel very
uncomfortable as someone literally was
just like mine power trip problems let's
get into the video so as you can tell by
the title today's video is going to be
my top makeup geek eyeshadows I wanted
to do this video for you because it is
one of the most requested videos here on
my channel and since I just got done
doing my Bridal tutorial which was the
most requested video here on my channel
I figured why not just go ahead and
knock this one out two back-to-back so I
was at first going to do a top 10 video
but then it kind of turned into like a
top 18 like 19 of them so I am clearly
not going to spend tons of detail time
on every single individual eyeshadow
telling you why you need this in your
life and why it's so amazing I'm going
to just go through them pretty quickly
give you a quick description show you a
swatch and move on so these are my
personal favorite colors and shades and
before showing you the swatches of each
eyeshadow I will just quickly say that
makeup geek eyeshadows as a whole are my
absolute favorite
eyeshadows and all of cosmetics matte
eyeshadow
are really great as well and I know tons
of people compare Mac and make it peak
because they're always curious which is
better I will say me personally there's
no comparison makeupgeek is way better
Mac has great eye shadows as well I love
Mac but once you get used to working
with makeup geek it's just like and then
you go back to math you're like oh there
is a difference in this so mega gig is
my absolute favorite of all time and the
best part about that is that these are
really half the price of a Mac eye
shadow literally 50% off so these are
like a drugstore price I shadow for a
very high-end product which is awesome
so they come in the magnetic like this
the little magnet just pop right in a Z
palette you can also buy the Z palettes
online at makeup geek or you can get
them in individual compacts I always
suggest getting everything magnetic it's
much easier to travel you're not going
to lose it you're not going to misplace
it it's all right here in a Z palette I
will link all of that good stuff below
for you guys first one is eh smoothie
this is a really creamy milky peach
shade I use this almost every single day
to put in my crease as my transition
color and almost everybody can wear this
just to buff out any neutral toned
eyelet that you are doing to make sure
that you don't have any harsh lines in
the crease it is also ideal for
summertime to warm up that eye area a
little bit without going too warm next
we have creme brulee this is a little
bit darker than peach smoothie and not
as peachy this one reminds me of Mac's
soft brown but it's not as pink as soft
brown it's a little bit more of a
neutral shade but it does have a little
bit of warmth in it but not overboard
everybody can wear it this color
depending how light or dark you are you
can wear this as a transition color or
you can wear as an outer corner if you
just want a little bit of depth next we
have frappe this is ideal for someone
who has a slight tan putting it in a
outer crease corner we're really warm up
the eye area it has a little bit of red
tones in it but again this is not too
red where it's going to make you look
you of pinkeye
a lot of people can wear this color but
again if you have a slight tan this will
be perfect for you this one right here
is called purely naked and what I love
this shadow for is if you're working
with a shadow that just has
the cult time blending and you go in
with this on a fluffy brush and kind of
work that product into the other
eyeshadow this will really help blend it
out and the reason why is because it has
a little bit of shimmer in it but not
too much sure to the point that it's
just frosty it does have some matte
properties but some little bit of flecks
of shimmer in it so you can still use it
as a transition color as long as you're
not really really heavy-handed with it
this color though would be absolutely
gorgeous on a teenage girl who is just
starting a makeup and really wants to
get into building a makeup collection
this would be beautiful all over the lid
in the crease area it's a nice natural
shade which is a little bit of shimmer
and the light will reflect on it really
beautifully next we have preppy this is
such a different eye shadow than
anything I've ever seen which is why I
was initially so drawn to it it is like
a muted down army green it has some
green yellowy properties in it but yet
it still is like a brown shade those of
you who have all of undertones in your
skin this is going to be ideal on you
and what's great about this color is
it's going to compliment brown eyes and
light eyes so so many people can wear it
and then of course text me one of my
most used eyes shadow is of all time
this is Coco bear this eye shadow it is
so amazing it is a very very warm red
tone brown it is deep it is pigmented it
is just juicy I love this color so much
I use it almost every single day even if
I'm just using it to smoke out that
lower lash line I love this it's
absolutely gorgeous and again brown eyes
and light eyes this will make both of
them pop because it's got that warm
depth of brown in it it's just going to
be complimentary on
my color it's beautiful we have
chickadee I absolutely love this color
so many people are intimidated by shades
like this Adobe they are so much fun to
work with especially if you have like a
darker skin tone like a Rihanna skin
tone even darker than that colors like
this are gorgeous gorgeous in your
crease area at a transition color it
just looks so beautiful on those skin
tones I use this all the time if I'm
doing anything warm I'll just put a
little bit of it on my brush and just
buff out up in that crease and it won't
look orange it'll just give a really
nice beautiful glow if you have some tan
in your skin this summer and you just
put a little bit of this in your crease
area it won't look orange it will
honestly just make the eyes look alive
and give it a lot of warmth again brown
and my eyes are going to complement from
this color because of the light buttery
orange shades in it it's just absolutely
beautiful
so that is chickadee this is the shade
glamorous and this is a really nice all
over lid color it's one of those shades
it's very simple it takes really no
thought you can put this all over the
lid and then just buff it out with some
Peach Smoothie or creme brulee and
that's it call it a day oh my god that
rhyme I'm so dr. Seuss's long-lost child
next we have cosmopolitan this reminds
me a lot of mac expensive pink except
cosmopolitan is a lot creamier and a lot
more pigmented therefore it's easier to
apply again this is a shadow that takes
no thought whatsoever you just put it
all over the lid buff it out and you're
good to go or if you really want to play
it up you can add some depth in the
crease and make it a little bit more
smoky and stand out this is such an
ideal color for the summer time it just
has such a beautiful shower of gold yet
pink and rose all mixed into one it's so
gorgeous
and tons of people can wear this this
specific eye shadow it will make green
eyes really really pop it's beautiful on
green eyes now we have shimma shimma
this one kind of reminds me of steel
akin if you guys are familiar with that
shadow it's like an award-winning shadow
by Sela and this is pretty much the same
concept it is very very buttery very
pigmented and a very beautiful shimmery
color that just goes all over the lid
this can also be used as a brow
highlight it can be
high cheekbones the cupid bow remember
when you have an eye shadow it does not
only have to go on the eyes I've use
eyeshadows as contours and highlights
many many times and it's just a
beautiful all-over color pretty much
everybody can use this color for
something it has a little bit of like a
vanilla pinky beige in it it's not just
a white which is what makes it so
versatile following that up we have ice
queen this is a stark white eyeshadow
and it has a little bit of shimmer in it
I like using this as an inner corner
highlight but when I do so I'm use a big
fluffy brush and just kind of lightly
brush it in that inner corner so that
it's not stark white because it can be
very intense this is ideal for someone
who is extremely fair in skin tone and
has a hard time finding a highlight that
actually shows up on them ice queen will
be your BFF next we have moonstone this
is kind of a difficult shade to describe
but it's like a dark pewter e purpley
silvery Mavi shade I think I don't do it
was difficult to describe it is
absolutely beautiful though you can wear
this all over the lid and then you can
buff it out with browns or you can buff
it out with purples the power you want
to play it up and it's just a really
easy way to do a smoky eye and this is
going to look good on it literally
everybody it's just one of those colors
that everyone can wear next we have
mocha this is such a staple eyeshadow
right here everybody can use in their
collection it is a really dark mid-tone
Brown it's a little bit on the cool side
but it's not too cool to the point that
it's going to dull down the eye area if
that makes sense this can be used as
eyeliner it can be used to smoke up the
lower lash line it can be used in the
outer corner just to make the eyes a
little bit more intense it is just so
beautiful everybody can use this
everybody needs a great matte Brown in
their collection so this is mocha this
right here is one of my favorites I
don't think I've ever talked about and
this is called Envy this is such a
beautiful dark green with little tiny
flecks of turquoise in it it speaks for
itself I don't have to say much about it
it's creamy so easy to blend and it's
just absolutely beautiful I'm thinking
about doing a
this student so if you guys want to see
that let me know because I absolutely
love this color next we have burlesque
this pretty much speaks for itself again
it doesn't need much of an explanation
it is just a beautiful dark cranberry
plum --is-- purple and had the perfect
amount of shimmer and it works so easy
to blend this can be worn in many
different ways if you put this all over
your lid area and blend it out that will
just be an easy guaranteed smokey eye
that will look great on absolutely
everybody no matter how light dark warm
cool whatever eye color you have this
will look beautiful on everybody next we
have the shade bit this is my absolute
favorite eyeshadow from makeup geek of
all time
I have nothing like it I've never seen
an eyeshadow like it is just absolutely
gorgeous
it is a matte color but at the same time
it applies like it's a satin because
it's so creamy you wouldn't expect it to
be a matte this is like a purple plum
wine kind of brown color it is hard to
explain but just absolutely gorgeous I
have been replacing this with my Browns
recently so instead of using cocoa bear
I'll use bit in or I'll mix it with
cocoa bear or I'll mix it with mocha
I've been using it to buff out my lower
lash line a lot I have to spend
absolutely loving this and the great
thing about it is it's so perfect for
spring summer and fall
because it's going to just bring an
extra pop to the eye without looking
like you're trying too hard without
really looking like you're wearing
purple because it still has a little bit
of that dark brown to it but yet it is
purple that makes sense it's just
absolutely gorgeous and again this is
going to look good on every eye color
it's just so beautiful so that's been
this is the shade cupcake which is a
really nice light Mabi pink color it is
a matte shade I honestly not a fan of
like baby pink colors on my eyes
whatsoever so I would not say that this
is like a baby pink I did not use this
for a long time after I had it in my
collection because finally one day I was
like wait this isn't so scary I actually
went and used it and it comes off more
of like a dusty rose shade on the eyes
it's just beautiful it has a little bit
that mommy color in it so it looks
really beautiful on tan skin as well as
light skin this is a great color to dust
in the crease for an everyday look if
you don't want to do like a brown or
anything it's also beautiful to buff out
any sort of purples or Pink's that
you're working with
this right here is Mango Tango and this
is like an orange e pinky mango e type
color what I love about this is you can
really play up the pink in it or the
orange in it depending how you do the
rest of your eye look I love wearing
this all over the lid with bitten in the
crease and then I will buff it out with
cupcake and I think it's a beautiful way
to wear this but again you can play up
the orange or the pink in it depending
what your personal preference is our
last but not least I'm going to mention
a basic eyeshadow because everybody
needs a good basic black and this is the
shade corrupt I have used so many blacks
so many black eyeshadows in my life and
I'm telling you there is no eyeshadow
out there that is creamy this one it is
in tense the one thing I will say about
this eyeshadow is if you're going to use
it make sure that you have a tissue
under your eyes or you have nuts on your
foundation and concealer yet because you
are going to have fallout because it is
so so creamy it is so pigmented it's
absolutely insane this is I'm not
kidding the blackest eyeshadow on the
market I've never seen a black or
eyeshadow alright you guys so that
completes my top 19
I shan't focus from makeup geek such a
random number only me but I had to
choose only 19 colors from makeup geek
these would be them right here and these
are going to look good on tons of
different people so I really hope that
