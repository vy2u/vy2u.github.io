going to be very different I don't I'm
like oh so on my mind right now I've
never done anything like this before
I've never put myself out there like
this before I've never felt this
vulnerable turning on my camera before
uh my background is such a mess I don't
know what that is but I just I had to
get on here and talk about something
that's just been that's a boat you hear
like the horn beeping uh I had to get
out of here and talk about something
that's just been weighing down on me so
hard recently I was thinking about like
maybe just quickly bringing it up and a
makeup tutorial I was like no I'm not
gonna bring that into a makeup video and
ruin the video for myself I just want to
bring it up now I just want to get this
off my chest and just talk to you guys
like a real person so if you like
sometimes you guys forget that I'm a
real person just because I get on here
and I'm talking about makeup and I'm
just like then we're gonna blend out the
crease and I'm just always like like so
peppy I think a lot of people forget
that I have blood in my veins I cry when
I'm sad I bleed when I get cut and I'm
just a real person I do not want this
video to be taken in the way that I'm
addressing negativity I am in no way
wanting anyone to feel sorry for me
because I have a very blessed life and
I'm very happy to do everything that I
do on YouTube off YouTube I love my life
I do I'm very appreciative for it so I'm
not asking anyone to feel sorry for me
but this is not about me necessarily
this is about everything and everyone
going on recently I know I can't change
the world I know I can't bring world
peace I know that I'm not God and really
Frankie taking things out of my trash
can um but I just want so badly to try
to encourage you guys to just find
happiness and put your energy towards
the greater good and I know that so much
easier said than done but in the past
two weeks I've had to disable the
comments on two videos of mine Oh which
is the first time I've ever had to do
that in my youtube career I've been
fortunate enough to never have to
disable comments due to negativity but
there's been two specific videos
recently where the negativity has been
so bad and so overwhelming that it's
like bringing me down and it's making me
not want to go to my videos it's making
me not
to film videos it's making me not want
to get creative it's making me scared of
my youtube channel and I know that
there's hundreds and more like thousands
of people out there that feel the exact
same way as me they're scared to leave
comments on my video that are scared to
interact with me because of the
negativity that has been happening and
it's just been getting so bad recently
and I know I can't make a change and a
stop to this but at the same time this
is my channel and so I just want to make
this video to try to do something about
it because the way everyone is speaking
to each other breaks my heart it's not
even about me at this point
I mean people of course are so mean to
me and rip me apart on the daily but it
comes with the territory you know even
though I never planned on having
millions of subscribers I do and it
happens and so even though things hurt
I'm just kind of like tough enough dad
when like gotta take it it happens you
got to deal with it it's just the price
you pay when you put yourself out there
and I get that it's so much past that
though it's so much worse than just that
recently I mean someone will leave a
comment
that's not even rude and then someone
will come in and accuse them of being
rude and then it will go back and forth
and it'll get so out of control that
like an hour later there's now 40
comments and it's just nothing but
people cursing at each other and telling
each other how ugly they are they're
bitches and you're a and you're
this and you're that and it's just like
what is going on this is makeup this is
a makeup Channel and I I just feel so
sad because clearly everyone leaving
these comments are not satisfied and
happy with their life and that kills me
because everyone everyone deserves to be
happy and it just kills me that everyone
is just so quick to just jump down each
other's throats and be so vicious to
each other and I can't take it and when
someone leaves me a nasty disgusting
comment I delete it and when I see
someone else in Ian's nasty disgusting
the comment even if I see them defending
you leaving a nasty disgusting comment I
see it I'm gonna delete it I don't care
if it's towards me if it's towards you I
don't care if some people think that you
deserve it I don't appreciate it and I
don't approve of it I don't want this
kind of negativity and it's everywhere
it's not just
so many of my friends on YouTube and
social media have been texting me
recently like is it a full moon out like
what's going on are you receiving as
much negativity as I am and we're all
like yes what's happening like it's just
getting so vicious out there and I just
want to encourage you guys to think
about the fact that when you're typing
on your keyboards you are typing into a
person's heart and into a person's mind
and you can really affect them and you
can really cause them emotional damage
and make them very sad and I see girls
go back and forth just now I just
witnessed this a few minutes ago it
started off with someone say they're
giving me constructive criticism but it
actually wasn't constructive criticism
because that's something that people do
they say I wouldn't give you
constructive criticism and then they go
on to tell me how I'm fake I'm money
hungry and I'm a bitch and I've changed
and I'm just like but it was a comment
like that there was very very mean and
then someone came to my defense it was
like leave her alone if you don't like
her don't watch her and this person came
back called her the most disgusting name
and then she went back called her
disgusting name 60 comments later
they're telling each other you're an
ugly ho you don't even deserve the love
of a man you're gonna be alone forever
and I'm just like oh my god over a
makeup video and what that says to me is
that it has nothing to do with this
video it has nothing to do with me it
has nothing to do with my makeup look it
has nothing to do with the people that
you're fighting with is nothing to do
with any of this it has to do with you
and that's really hard to admit and I
had to admit those things to myself
because I get on camera and I'm happy
and I'm peppy des filles I love what I'm
doing here I'm not always happy and
peppy I had been diagnosed with
obsessive-compulsive disorder depression
anxiety panic attacks agoraphobia I mean
I have so many mental issues I've worked
through and I was going to a therapist
three times a week for two and a half
hours Monday Wednesday Friday for two
years while I was here on YouTube and
you guys didn't know about it because I
had a lot of personal issues so I
understand those people they're leaving
these negative nasty comments to me
because I get your mind and I know that
sounds weird but I understand it when
you're unhappy you lash out at everybody
like I get it I I've had such horrible
times my life and horrible days they'll
just start screaming at John I'm just
like I
you and John knows it's not about him
and John's like what's this about this
isn't about me am I going to know it
about you and it's about a million other
things that's what happens on social
media if you are going in on someone
making a makeup video you need to stop
and think to yourself for a second what
is really upsetting me because it cannot
be this world it cannot be my video or
the next person's video or this girl who
loved to comment like what's really
going on like there's so much more to
life out there than this YouTube world
in my channel and there's so much more
out there to make up into beauty even
though I love it so much it's a hobby
it's a passion of mine and it's a job
but this is not all that life is about
life is about love and laughter and
family and friends and adventure and in
God and the greater good that's what
life is about helping others giving back
feeling good about yourself in those
ways and I guess I'm going off on a
little bit of a rant a lot of a rant
um but I just I just want to get on here
and just talk to you guys and you know
these comments I just read with these
girls going back and forth at each other
I just look at them and I think to
myself like they both have to be feeling
miserable right now you cannot be in a
social media war and feel good about
yourself you can't go to sleep that
night like like no one feels like that
even if you got the last slap or you got
the last word and you see you can't tell
me it's you honestly feel good about
that
it feels gross it feels nasty inside and
there's no reason to do it my channel is
a happy place I am a happy person I have
worked my frickin ass off to be a happy
person this did not come naturally to me
I have had to put in so much effort so
much effort into being a happy person
because it's not easy to be happy and
positive every single day but like we
have to try that's what this channel is
about this channel is about beauty and
if I am doing a makeup look that reminds
you of something else I've recently done
you can let me know you can tell me
okay I think this is super similar to
like your warm round smokey eye that you
did a month ago or something
that's not gonna upset me like I've
always said to everyone in my life you
can say anything you want to anybody you
want as long as you say it the right way
like you can tell someone you hate their
guts and you can do it in a polite way
like trust me it can be done like but
you don't have to be rude you don't have
to cuss and I'm not just talking about
me I'm talking about everybody on social
media I've just been so sick recently
over comments you guys are leaving to me
leaving to each other leaving to other
people it's just gotten so bad you guys
and there's so many things happening in
our world right now we don't need to be
turning against each other we are women
okay and we already have so many things
against us we don't need to be against
each other like basically I'm just
asking you to take each other's hands
and stand strong and if you don't like
me that's okay don't watch me that is
perfectly fine I'm not gonna argue with
you if you think that I'm ugly or my
broken crooked nose disgusts you or my
lips are too thin or you think my
personality is fake all the things I get
to on daily basis if you're one of those
people who believe those things then
just don't watch my channel for those of
you who are here because you want to
watch my videos and you are learning
something or you enjoy your time here on
my channel thank you so much and all I
ask from you is that you just don't
engage with negativity if there's a
nasty comment try say something nice to
them or just walk away and just ignore
it because that's what I'm trying to do
I'm trying to just walk away and ignore
it or if it's really mean I will delete
it because I don't I don't care how much
I put myself out there at social media I
don't and nobody deserves someone
ripping them apart and just telling just
feeding lies I don't need those lies I
Know Who I am I do not need to see
people making lies about me
I just want our community to be better
than what we are and I was so happy to
be a part of this community when I
started and recently I've been almost
feeling like ashamed and guilty because
it's gotten so ugly and I just want us
to I want us to start fresh you guys I
wanted to start over I never want to
disable my comments again I just want us
to hold hands and unite I don't care how
tall how short how skinny how fat I
don't care the color of your skin the
color of your eyes man woman gay
straight asexual I don't care about any
of
I just want to stand together that's it
let's just empower each other and
encourage each other because no one ever
becomes successful
by kicking others down I have seen so
many people in my life just be nasty to
everyone around them and they never go
anywhere and I'm just like what are you
doing
change your - dude like come on like if
you don't like me don't watch me if you
do like me let's hang out let's keep
doing our thing
let's enjoy makeup let's talk about
beauty products I want this to be the
place you guys can come at the end of
the stressful day after your bosses
yelled at you and you've worked overtime
and you came home to your kids screaming
and one's got an ear infection and it's
now 11:30 at night and you've got a
glass of wine and you're like okay I'm
gonna sit down and watch my make a video
that's what I want to be I want to be
that place that you can come to for rest
in 15 minutes of just relaxation where
you to forget about the real problems
that's what I want to be for you guys so
that's it that's all I have to say in
this video hopefully the message is
received I know that I'm a little
intense right now and I know everything
is very messy behind me but this has
been weighing so strong on me and I just
had I had to get it out I had to say it
so the end of the day I want you to know
my dogs are going crazy I would you know
that I love you guys so much like the
people not I didn't want to say like my
number-one fans or like my hill stores

constructive criticism or maybe negative
feedback trying to help me I still love
you those of you who are just watching
me and care about me and enjoy my videos

very sorry that the negative negative
comments have just been so horrible
recently but hopefully we can make a
change and stand together to do so
