gold but I've never thought that my life
would be this ever and it is truly all
because of you guys and I'm literally

just so thankful for you and it's just
crazy I was thinking about you today I
was like when I first started YouTube
and I had no subscriber to subscribers
so I can't yourself Allen's doing my
thing like I was doing it though just so
passionate about makeup you know like I
had crappy camera equipment crappy
lighting like I was using lamps you know
I'm saying like whatever it was genuine
and that was my my passion which is
makeup what I just loved makeup and it's
crazy because I still love makeup so
much and that passion is just as strong
but on the other hand my passion for
YouTube has now become my subscribers
like I'm no longer as passionate about
the makeup as I am about you guys like I
don't know I'm just I'm so grateful for
like our little community and our family
like that we have built it really is so
real if you're new here to my channel
and it sounds cheesy I'm sorry but I
know that there's thousands and
thousands and thousands of people out
there that feel the exact same way gonna
meet you guys and I swear to God as we
have an instant connection I feel like
we're sisters
like I'm so thankful for you and you are
the reason I went sit down and keep
doing videos no matter how busy I get no
matter how it were won't I think about
my subscribers oh my god I've got to get
back on camera like I missed you guys so
I can't say how thankful I am like I
don't know if I can ever do to repay you
so yeah anyway it's not battling against
this video is actually about which is
this
suppose I'm wearing right now soon
because India and makeup tutorial on
this right here I am full obsessed like
beyond and I hope it made you so much
again you guys for getting me outside my
comfort zone because I've definitely
become like the neutral queen if you
will
I'm not crying I thought okay you get
anyways I'm just obsessed neutrals like
I've got in this neutral rut if you will
to past eight months to a year causing
my three year let's get real I just love
my neutral I do but you guys definitely
inspired me to go outside my comfort
zone and also on by Brooke hell she's an
Instagram artist she's incredible I've
been following her for a very very long
time
and every time she post something I'm
just going to my feet I was always like
kicking back by the beauty of her looks
and she definitely uses a lot of color
so I also want to say thank you to her
for inspiring this look I just I love it
so today I didn't want to do anything
too crazy yet I didn't do it all blue
smokey eye or all purple smokey eye I
wanted to start off below so I stepped
with some warm shades I incorporated
some gold some glitter I'm kind of
straddling my comfort zone right now
like I got one they're going to pull one
leg out if you follow me on snapchat
then you might know that I actually
filmed this video last week and he did
the way it turned out I shade the
footage it was like so yellow silver
both and Rydia voice over and over them
on about my life so long pretty short
action to refill this video today I'm so
glad it happened because I like this so
much more than I did last week
so anyways under thought that me you
guys thank you for watching this video
I love you and I will see you very soon
mmm bye
I am so excited XS are off by priming my
eyes we was using a little bit of the
chart sheet cake concealer and then I
will go over it with a translucent
powder that's what I personally prime my
eyes and the reason I always go over it
with some powder is because the eye
shadow will go on and apply and blend
out so smooth if you have a powder on
first as opposed to going over it just
look like a tacky concealer like tacky
primer eyeshadow just won't blend
properly and it just adds a lot more
work for you so I always recommend
setting your eye primer we got powder I
feel like it makes a world of a
difference I'm going to be going in the
color drain Queen of Hearts I shadow
palette today
I believe why God why why guys do
deserve that you you get back in your
place you get back in that hole I'm
going to start off by going in with
these two shades right here which is air
and Royal Prerogative
both of these shades are a mess and I'm
going to just put them right here in the
lower area of the crease I'm mixing them
together and we dipping my brush in air
and then in royal product head and
tapping out the excess and then going
right in to this crease area and I'm
using a long haired natural brush and as
you can see I'm doing it mainly from the
outer corner and then once I base we
have nothing left on my brush I'll bring
it to the inner corner but the one thing
if you want to avoid is staying away
from this region up here and I don't
wanna get too close to the inner part of
my brow because then it will give me
more like a masculine like kind of look
you can see like I'm just putting that
product right there basically in the
crease I don't want to go above the
crease me inner corner I don't want to
go above the crease on the outer corner
and with that basically nothing look at
my brush I'm going to just softly bring
that up towards the brow area I am going
to using a color pop super shock shadow
in the shade Ibiza I'm just thinking
this on a small little fluffy brush any
brush would honestly do anything to get
that color on the inner corner I'm just
going to put this on that entire inner
corner area we want the majority of this
color right there in that inner corner
like in that tear duct area and then we
want to fade out from there alright so
now we have that turquoise blue in the
inner corner I'm going to pick up the
Queen of Hearts palette again and I'm
going to grab a Queen Mother which is
this really beautiful shimmery purple
shade right here and I don't normally
put shimmery purples in the outer corner
of my eye but today we're we're just
trying a new thing if y'all trying to
thing I'm going to just pack this on I
am using the exact same brush as I did
for the inner corner I just wiped it off
on a paper towel so there was like no
loose blue eyeshadow up on it but just
going to use the same brush and I'm
going to pack this on right out on the
outer corner my first time ever using
this eyeshadow brush and I really like
it so now I'm going to grab your majesty
which is this beautiful shimmery gold
right here in the center of the palette
and then I do the exact same brush again
going to practice on the center and then
blend it let's go slightly put it over
that blue slightly put over the purple
just to blend all of that together
because you don't want it to be too
choppy we don't want it to be like blue
Google purple like we wanted to have you
know kind of like its ombre emotion to
it so I'm going to go back in with a
little more of that matte orange shade
on a fluffier brush I'm going to just
take it right over the corners of that
purple just to give it more of a pop so
now just because I don't love the way
the outer corner looking I'm going to
grab some mac deep damson eyeshadow on a
fluffy brush I'm going to pack that over
the outer corner of the eye and it's
kind of low down here I just want to
have a little bit more depth
I am I got a makeup wife and just clean
up some of this fallout we do it as look
in a really grungy under there so now I
cleaned everything up with a makeup
remover literally all I did is just wipe
it away then I take my nail or if you
don't have long nails you just use a
q-tip and just take it and just go like
right along the side of it and it will
give you like that nice cut I look as
opposed to just being like really messy
like it was before I'm taking a totally
clean brush and I'm just going to
lightly go over this area just to make
sure that everything is of course
blended too filled with no harsh lines
now pick up a little bit of this matte
gorgeous magenta called ladyship I
honestly don't know where I'm going to
do it but I'm just going to pick a
little bit of a bomb expression to see
we're not going to-- pretty I like put
it in this area I don't know I just love
it yeah I love that extra little pop oh
my god so pray all right so now all the
colors that you've applied all the
blending that was done that gold in the
center of my lid has definitely faded
and I want that to pop so I'm gonna do
I'm gonna grab some Vic but I'm going to
dip a brush back into that gold shade
and I'm going to spritz my brush with
the Facebook and then I'm going to just
take this and starting off low on the
bottom and I'm very lightly going to tap
this in the center very lightly if you
go in there start like everywhere you're
going to make a message to really can't
clean up so we're going to start off
really lightly as the brush is wet it's
kind of damp around and then you may
want to wait a couple seconds until the
brush is a little more on the dry side
and then that you can go and kind of
blend it out all right I'm gonna put
some mascara on my lashes and I'm going
to pop on some false ones you better do
not have to do false lashes for this
look eventually just curl your lashes
and do some mascara but you know me I've
gotta be extra once you get used to
using false lashes it's like you feel
like you look weird without them like
it's awful I don't start the false lash
trend if you have it like I know it
sounds silly but just use them every
once in a while on special occasions or
don't use them at all honestly because
when I see a girl that kathleenlights
who always does looks like not using
false lashes I'm always like so at least
to like
oh I wish I could do that by I look
so weird except this grown so accustomed
to seeing myself with false lashes that
six once you start you can't go back
alright so I apply the flutter lash in
the style intoxicating honestly to know
you guys like it's pretty much the only
lash I'd use like that in slay la for
like the past three months and I'm just
so upset I think there's almost
beautiful lashes ever and it makes it so
that you really don't have to wear
eyeliner because the band is really nice
and thick and has a great shapes when
you put it on it gives that black
definition you really don't need to do
any liner which is amazing I'm going to
prime my face i'm using this Sisley
primer that i keep going back and forth
on because it is so expensive and I
really don't want to love it from the
bottom of my heart but I do feel like it
into the primary but I've been going
back and forth between several primers
recently because there's a lot of them
that I purchased the past couple of
months and this is just one of them for
foundation I'm going to be using to do
your skin forever foundation oh my gosh
too bad I'm sure I'll be raving about
this in my favorite video very soon I'm
going more in depth but let me just say
wow so i'ma say Wow I'm using the morphe
m43 9 brush to just buff that in all
over my face
and something I have noticed recently
because back in the day when I first are
doing youtube I always always always
always always under no exceptions always
did my eyeshadow first and then my
foundation and then I kind of got more
into the foundation first routine and
recently I've been going back and forth
is something I have noticed is when I do
my eye first my foundation looks so much
better throughout the day and what I
think is is that when I do my foundation
perfect no matter how much I use powder
or how much I bake I pull up courthouse
fallout where I'm applying my eye shadow
and then maybe I'll be like touching my
skin I like doing my eyes and it just
like this area alright Caragh my
under-eye area especially it doesn't
look as good throughout the day when I
do my eyeshadow birth and then my
foundation my foundation just looks its
absolute best it's just something I've
noticed recently so I've been trying to
do my eyes first unless it's like a
super super easy natural eye look just
because well I want that flawless finish
let's get real
alright I'm using some of the
heart-shaped take on my under eye area
and I'll also put it on other areas of
the face actually
a bit more coverage concealer so much
when you do your eyeshadow first and
then you do your concealer you have to
be really really careful when it gets to
that I shadow line that I created that
line earlier so now I have to make sure
that I use a pointed Beauty Blender and
get right up next to it but you just
don't want to like pass or top of it
otherwise you will ruin the IHI which
you created okay now for powder I'm
going to go in with the Charlotte
Tilbury airbrush flawless finish powder
it looks like this and as I apply it I
think of a tiny bit at a time and I just
lightly stay up as you can see in little
pellets emotions I'm going to take the
exact same powder but in shade lighter I
was using shade two for my face and it's
a shady one I'm just going to put that
right underneath my eyes I do like my
under eye area to be just a little bit
lighter than the rest of my face not a
ton but definitely a little bit alright
let's do these brows voila
bold bold eyebrows alright moving on to
the lower lash line I'm going to pick up
some of that matte orange shade from the
palette and after off by just connecting
that upper shadow to the lower water
this plane is orange all along the lower
lash line
alright I'm going to stop about 75% of
the way in you can get to go back in
with that color pop blue I'm going to
put that in the lower lash line going to
just connect it to that inner corner
alright I'm gonna grab some more of that
match keep dancing which is that dark
purple tie definitely my right is like
starting to water never I'm just going
to push this right up against my actual
lash line nice and tight alright going
back to that same puzzle brush that I
use to apply the orange I'm going to
blend that all together and go back in
with that same original gold that we
used on the center of the eye I'm going
to strip my brush with some thick stuff
again I'm going to pop that in the very
center of the lower lash line I'm gonna
bronze my face really quick I'm going to
be using the colour-pop topaz duo I have
just been so in love with this bronzer
recently it's weird I really haven't
been contouring recently I don't know
why like I've just gotten into the habit
of just bronzing we used to contour
every day I didn't even know how to do
my name without contouring and now I
haven't done it in months I feel like
the trend used to be like contour
contour contour and now the trend is all
about highlighting and so I feel like I
just accidentally fell away from it I
would start contouring again though I
just I mean forget I just start rounding
out like whoops I'm going to use some
Ennis Agia clear brow gel to set these
brows I always always do this after I
brought my face because I know that my
bronzer brush is going to go over my
eyebrows and mess them up when I'm
bronzing in this area right here so I
always wait until I'm totally done with
my bronzer or my contour and then I go
in and set my brows I'm going to grab a
little bit of the makeup forever starlet
powder in a shade 13 I'm going to use
that to highlight my brow bone real
quick well you see that highlight see
how set that is it's another level this
highlight is insane I'm going to grab
this holographic palette by Kat Von D
first of all this packaging is so dope I
don't even really see on camera but it's
so cool and then all these colors just
look like they're really light pastel
but the ones are swash they have the
most beautiful oh my god my nails look
so disgusting that embarrassing
seriously I need to get together right
then do it happily but I'm going to grab
that blue sapphire shade I'm going to
pop that in the inner corner to really
make that like inner turquoise top
oh my god I love oh my gosh that is so
sick I'm gonna grab some of the
Maybelline eye studio gel liner and the
shade blackest black are a little tiny
precise brush and I'm going to line my
upper waterline which looks really
creepy I know the first time I ever saw
someone do this all right what I am
doing but it makes a really really big
difference especially in person outside
the camera fix it up but in person it
just makes your bulk eyelashes look so
much more natural and clearly we're
going to like a super natural makeup
looks today
I'm going to throw some mascara on my
lower lash line real quick are actually
just where I'm sitting with that black
liner on my lower lash line as well now
I'm looking I want to give it more of a
pop so I'm going to just take that exact
same technique using a little tiny minor
brush and just go ahead and glide that
on alright so for blush I'm going to be
trying to cut a cosmetic blush in the
shade x-rated it looks like this
okay and then for highlight I want to
try this highlighter shades it just
looks so beautiful right here it's
bicolor pop and witnesses I don't know
I'm pretty sure their new collection
though because there's a couple of them
but this is going to have like the
Bronte or shade in it and I want to try
to highlight I will find it and link it
down below for you guys
it just looks promising with this flock
that I did earlier so I just want to
know I don't want to be too highlighted
today I don't want to be like blinding I
want to be a little bit more subtle oh
my god Wow okay color pop oh my gosh I
saw the color pop s step up their game
recently like at first I was not too
sure but recently I have been so
impressed with their products
I'm gonna do a tiny bit of that on my
toes just a little boo-boo yeah I can't
help myself I'm gonna take a little bit
of champagne pop boom you guys I just
feel like champagne pop makes everything
better and I love the peachy undertone
of this has in it and so it's going to
mix really well with my eye color so
anytime I do like a golden eye or brown
the I like a peachy coral on my eye I
only want to go on with champagne pop
just because I feel like it is so
complementary to those I shape yeah it
warms it up just a little bit Oh Sophia
I can't help it every single time I
apply champagne pop I'm still like just
proud mama you like how I start off by
saying I just really don't want a
blinding highlight today and I'm like
fine
okay so now for the lips I'm going to go
in with the Kat Von D liquid lipstick in
the shade
really quick with some setting spray the
setting spread I'm using is not yet
available I'm so sorry but a brand said
it to me and obsesses it I'm going to be
using that for today but I'm sure to be
out soon I have to just do one more
thing I want to add glitter to the
center of my lid
I'm aware we've been done something
really
50 minutes and I'm about to get
something to eat now look wait a second
I have to come back and do it really
quick I'm going to be using the Urban
Decay heavy metal glitter liner in the
shade Midnight Cowboy and all I'm going
to do is just lightly sweep this right
across the center of my lid I don't need
to do too much just a little bit but I
feel like I need like a little pop but I
don't know I can't hold it I just always
want to add glitter to everything it
okay that's better
Oh get it started in here why don't you
blow me that's unacceptable
stickin up like a bamboo sup yeah good
