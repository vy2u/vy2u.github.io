alcohol I never get to go to also which
is very disappointing I love all tub I
do not have one anywhere near me but a
couple of days ago it was my niece's
birthday party and there was an altar
right next door so I left like an hour
early and stopped and went to Ulta
priorities let me just start off by
saying that I love Ulta because they
have the drugstore side of it and they
have the high end so you can be like ah
so fancy but then you can turn around
and bring it in for the real thing so I
really appreciate that Ulta fears to
both what I don't know if I want to go
through this like hair and then makeup
or just I'm just going to go through it
whatever it's random it's me right so
the first thing I got is this body wash
my philosophy and this is called melon
daiquiri i okay i Selimiye i I just
realized recently that all my body
washes are just like nighttime body
washes they're all like aromatherapy
like a eucalyptus and like made to help
you sleep and relax and relieve stress
and all that but that's because I'm a
nighttime shower were shower a shower on
the night time but recently I have been
taking showers in the morning and the
only really like daytime fun body wash
that I have that I've really been loving
for a while is the lush happy hippie so
I wanted to try something different
because I just love like summertime
fruity scents oh especially in the
shower and this one just literally
smells like summer in a bottle melon
daiquiri it smells like watermelon but
not like too extreme watermelons
I don't like straight-up fruit like I
don't want to wash myself with just
watermelon or like strawberry this one
has like a little like zest to it but
yet melon that make sense I picked up
this body butter by the body shop I love
this stuff so much it is insane and I
just haven't bought any of these body
butters in years but I used to go
through these like I couldn't really
afford them because when I used to buy
them years ago it was like $18 a piece
and I was like $18 for body butter but I
thought I would buy this because I just
absolutely loved it
my favorite one is like the almond
butter scent I think it is but this one
is coconut OH
just smells amazing and it is so
moisturizing if you have dry girl
problems or if you just like being super
moisturized the body shop body butter is
so luxurious I lather myself in this
before I go to sleep and my skin is
moisturize for literally 24 hours I love
it I got the Urban Decay all nighter
makeup setting spray this is supposed to
make your makeup last longer if you guys
watch my channel you know that I love
your vindicate chill makeup setting
spray which doesn't technically make
your makeup make your makeup last longer
it just really makes your makeup will
look more set and very dewy and fresh
looking but this I have heard great
things about it and especially from my
mother my mom is like obsessed with this
stuff and every time we go to Sephora I
feel like she's replenishing and buying
a new bottle constantly and she's like
you don't use this oh my god so I'm
gonna try an all nighter makeup setting
spray because my mom likes it so I feel
like I will like it it's oil free
paraben free and temperature control
technology so who says you I got the Too
Faced primed and poreless pure this is
oil free so they have like the original
primed and poreless but this is like a
newer version that is pure so it's oil
free skin smoothing face primer for
sensitive skin because this face is
sensitive to say the least
like anything will irritate my skin
anything will make it red anything will
give it bumps and texture my skin is
just like all times extremely sensitive
so I'm excited to try this because a lot
of times primers will irritate me since
I'm sensitive primers have some
ingredients in it that can just tend to
irritate my skin let me know any of you
guys have tried this yet because I have
not heard anything whatsoever about it
and I'm excited to try it but I would
love to know your opinion so if any of
you have tried the new primed and
poreless pure leave me a comment down
below and let me know what you think
about it cuz I'm scared I got two tools
by the brand Ulta like Ulta like
actually makes products too and I got
the professional skin clearing tool
which is just one of those tools that
has it two little holes on each end and
you use it to get rid of blemishes um
I've always wanted this and I don't know
why I've never gotten one
so when I saw it I was like yes my
sister who's an aesthetician I've seen
her use these tools and basically when
you have a blemish like you'll just take
it and like slightly push it over your
blemish and just kind of like slide it
down and it will literally like extract
the blemish for you so I've got one of
those tools it's called the skin
clearing tool because I'm excited to see
if it will work because recently I've
been getting blemishes that are not cute
and need to go and then I got the
artificial well it's just the last lash
placement tool the artificial lash
placement tool so a tool to apply your
falsies because I always use tweezers
but I've heard so many people say great
things about these tools that make so
basically it's light tweezers but it's
not as pointy so it won't stab your eye
out in case you get like scared or
something as you're applying so I just
wanted to see how this works for me
because I haven't used this tool before
when I was freelancing these weren't
like a popular thing so I'm excited to
try it out and see if I like it better
than tweezers I got razor it's necessary
I got two different mascaras one is new
to the mascara world and one is an oldie
but a goodie this is the l'oreal
voluminous extra volume collagen I just
love this mascara I've used it before
it's a very very volumizing very
thickening and it can definitely almost
make your lashes on the clumpy sorry
kind of but I really like this to apply
mascara before my false lashes and the
reason why is because it gives my
natural lashes lashes tons of volume and
makes them pitch black so when I put on
my false lashes they just blend in
beautifully I just that sounds silly but
this is my favorite way to use this
mascara before falsies I'm hyena's this
one was in the new section and it's been
able being pumped up colossal and I got
this one just because it says it has up
to 16 times the volume and then a
picture of the brush right there and I
liked the way the brush looked let me
open it so I can actually see it for the
first time
this is work okay I like the way it
shaped it's like a bullet love that
brush looks superb I love brushes like
that especially brushes that get fatter
and then smaller it's great for getting
every little hair okay I'm excited to
try this now
I've got this product off of your
recommendations because in my
highlighter video so many of you guys
were leaving comments down below your
favorite highlighters and I was reading
through them and the Too Faced
candlelight was mentioned a few times
from you guys so this is the Too Faced
candlelight glow and I don't know if you
can see it on the camera but this side
like half of it is like a pink highlight
and then this side is a white more beige
highlight but there is a gold undertone
in it so when you swatch it all together
because that's how I will use it is mix
it all together it comes out a really
beautiful beige that does have more of a
gold tone in it it looks really nice it
looks really creamy it's not insanely
pigmented like a lot of highlighters I
like but that's okay
I am really excited to try this because
I really do love the color of the
highlight I'm looking at you I are
trying to see like confuse C it looks
purty
I'm actually most excited about this
next product this is the Jane bronzer in
the shade inspire like it's like the
most simple thing but I'm so so excited
about this the packaging was super cute
but I took it off immediately and how to
swatch it cuz all like I'm so excited I
I went shopping a couple days ago and I
have like waited till this moment to dig
back into this bag and show you
everything so I have kind of swatched a
few things in the meantime said been
excited this again was a recommendation
from you guys on my drugstore video some
of you were saying that's the Jane Jane
bronzer and inspire was working at
drugstore bronzer because I just can't
find a lot of drugstore bronzers that I
absolutely love I like the NYC sunny
bronzer but it's still not like yes like
I'm not going to choose that one over my
high-end bronzers if that makes sense
it's good but it's not my favorite ever
this though so far it looks like it's
going to be an awesome bronzer I love
the color
in it okay again is it's showing-up it's
a very light bronze color it's nothing
crazy it's more like a caramel color
bronze it's not too red or two orange it
doesn't seem like it's going to be dusty
or powdery so I'm really excited to try
this
so for those of you who recommended this
me thanks in advance that's what the
Jame bronzer looks like right there I'm
excited I got a Maybelline eyeshadow in
the shade Berthe taupe okay this is
gonna be difficult to open give me a
second
oh my gosh it's off the entire sticker
from the back so I got the shade earth
taupe from Maybelline because when I saw
this I was like have I found a
transition color because I've mentioned
before that I cannot find good
transition colors from the drugstore
when it comes to that perfect color in
the crease to blend out shadows I have
the most difficult time finding like the
perfect beige brown it's going to be
similar to like make a deep creme brulee
or Mac soft brown something along that
line just to help blend everything out
and so when I saw this I thought maybe
maybe so now that I am just watching it
it does look like it's going to be a
nice transition color but you're going
to have to be very fair because it
doesn't have tons of pigment but it
still looks like it's going to work so I
will try it and let you know if you
don't hear from me that means it sucks
I just got a Marc Jacobs Daisy
rollerball for my purse and it's going
to be silly to even say this out loud
but I warned this poor perfume for so
many years and I stopped wearing it a
few years ago and I wore this in a very
very happy happy time of my life and you
know how cents bring back memories
this scent just brings back the best
memories for me so because of that I
only wear it every once in a while when
I'm just like wanting to feel that joy
that this brings me like I was on my
wedding day and so like if I'm doing
something that makes me nervous all wear
Marc Jacobs Daisy like if I'm doing like
a meet-and-greet or if I'm flying or
something that just kind of gets like my
nerves all shaken up I will wear this
and it actually truly like takes me to a
happy place and makes me feel calm and
peaceful inside' I know that's so random
but that's why I
the rollerball because I want it in my
purse just to use randomly cuz I just I
love it it's just a happy set and it
brings back happy times so there's a
little fad I got a two-faced la creme
la creme la creme color drenched lip
cream look okay so anyways I got a
lipstick from Too Faced it is called
razzle-dazzle rose I just thought it was
such a corny color and I don't have one
well let's get real yes I'm sure I have
something that looks identical to it but
not in my mind I just love the way it
blends out it's so like sheer but in a
good way it's sheer but yet it has the
perfect amount of pigment and it's very
creamy and it feels very moisturizing on
the lips I just think it's a beautiful
shade I love toned down colors they're
still a vibrant color that makes sense
it when you look at it you're like oh
that's a beautiful pinky purple but then
when you put it on you're like oh it's
very subtle I love that look especially
on days we're not wearing a lot of
makeup you can just pramukh mascara comb
through your brows and pon a lip color
like this and it just looks very fresh
and young and I just I love that so this
is razzle dazzle Rose such a cute name
razzle - then I got the Revlon Colorstay
ultimate liquid lipstick in the shade
altima twerkin I am very much into these
purple undertones right now for the lips
it is difficult to explain the
consistency of this liquid lipstick
because it's definitely not a gloss but
yet it doesn't feel like a lipstick when
it dries it almost feels more like a
stain that has a little bit of
creaminess in it it's hard to explain
but it does feel nice but it is
different than anything that I've ever
warm for I did but this open when I got
back from all-time Tryon sue me I just
kind of help myself it's so pretty I
wore this over cream cup the other night
like a couple of hours before I wash my
face and I just love it I think it's
absolutely beautiful
so does the Revlon liquid lipstick in
the shade altima - orchid I got a Tarte
Amazonian clay blush because I love
these blushes and I got it in the shade
dual face doll base I just thought this
was a very beautiful color and I really
truly feel like I don't have anything
extremely similar to it it's a very cool
tone baby pink it kind of reminds me of
pink swoon from Mac except this is a
little bit more
Palani if you guys can't tell I'm so
into this whole purple movement right
now I'm loving it so this is beat arch
12 our Amazonian clay in the shade
Dollface okay I am super excited about
this lipstick this is by Urban Decay
it's their revolution lipstick which the
scale in lipstick could have I believe
and by the way I mentioned it many times
before but just one more time the Urban
Decay lipstick formula is amazing it's
one of my absolute favorites it's
beautiful this is in the shade a liar
I've got this shade because when i
swatched it on myself I was like that's
Kylie Jenner but seriously it reminded
me so much of that 90's lip color that
kylie jenner has been rocking recently
which is so beautiful and everybody in
their mom is obsessed with it wearing
that with Macworld lipliner you've got a
Kylie lip right there it's absolutely
beautiful it's the perfect amount of
brown and rose and mauve mob mob all
mixed into one so it's beautiful liar by
Urban Decay I got the Rimmel London
show-off lip lacquer which what shade is
this it's in shade luna this is a
beautiful coral shade look how pigmented
that is it is amazing let me swatch it
for you like so you can actually see me
swatch can you see can you see okay
hello it's just beautiful it is a
gorgeous gorgeous orange color orange e
coral shade perfect for summer I
absolutely love oranges I love corals I
love all that I typically wear those
colors on my cheeks and eyes mainly but
I love them on the lips so I'm very
excited to try this and I honestly want
to go get these Rimmel lip lacquers and
every single shade now because I'm soul
they're so pigmented and creamy like yes
the last thing I got is a Maybelline
Color tattoo I got this because I really
like the color tattoos I think they're
great for especially underneath of
eyeshadow and there's supposed to be
24-hour wear and I think this color is
beautiful it's like a grey that has some
purple in it it is actually gorgeous
this would have been beautiful
underneath in my cool tone smokey eye if
I were to put this all over the lid
first and then gone in it would have
just given it more and
density it is so pretty and I honest to
god do not have anything like this so I
was like okay mine okay I only have a
few things left and they're all hair
products I know this video was probably
30 minutes in then I got two products by
the line below Pro I I've never tried
blow Pro and I've honestly never heard
anything about them but I was just
intrigued by the packaging and the name
I thought it was really funny this is
the body by blow as is the no crunch
bodybuilder meat mousse I cannot speak
today mousse mousse with pure protein
blend pumps up body and strength hold
style all-day resist heat damage
protects with UV they'll filter and I
was like oh I just love anything that's
going to give me body or volume because
I just have like a weird shaped head and
my hair just doesn't lay right and I do
you might think like but I'm serious
like my head just does it like it's not
like roundup here my head must be like
up here for some reason and my hair just
likes to dip me so I think anything is
going to give me a volume and body
that's what I mainly look for in my hair
if you have any recommendations for
volumizing anything you know what to do
this again is by blowpro it's called the
blow-up root lift concentrate it says it
adds lift long-lasting height that's
literally all I had to see and I was
like I just have any sort of volumizing
product that's like a root booster
that's going to give you more volume and
height so this is exactly the kind of
thing I'm looking for and I've tried so
many by so many different brands and I'm
always excited to try a new one so I'm
obviously excited to try this one last
but not least we have the Oscar blondie
dry texture and volume spray I have used
this a many times before I love it I
always get it in the smaller bottle but
I wanted to just get commits and get the
big bottle because I absolutely love it
I know I love it it gives great volume
it gives texture it's awesome if you're
wearing your hair really wavy and you
just want like that extra like kind of
Bed Head messy messy messy flirty look I
spray this in and just run my fingers
through it and it's just it's perfect
the dry texture and volume spray by
Oscar blondie boom alright you guys that
completes my haul I have products all
over myself and I'm trying not to touch
anything right now anyways
