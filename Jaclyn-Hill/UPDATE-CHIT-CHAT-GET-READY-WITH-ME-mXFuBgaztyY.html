my new Beauty room I'm so happy to be
here right now like I'm trying to like
doll down my excitement a little bit I
filmed this intro like 30 times because
I just I know I get a little overboard a
little over-the-top I'm not gonna lie
I've been having a dance party for the
past 30 minutes yes all by myself
cool so cool and I'm just so happy to be
in my beauty room and especially since
it's the first video 2016 I'm starting
it in my new space and just I feel so
relieved and just happy to be here so
yeah for today's video I wanted to do a
chit chat get ready with me because a
ton of people were requesting a chit
chat video and a lot of people are
asking if I would do an update video
just kind of like telling you guys like
what's going on with my life and all
that jazz so I thought why not combine
it I didn't want to just sit here like a
robot and just like talk to you so I
thought let's do our makeup together and
update you on my life and just chit chat
and hang out and do a girl's do best
right like this is my favorite thing to
do with my friends like they'll come
over to my house and we'll just sit in
my makeup room for like hours and just
listen to music and talk and drink wine
today is coffee because it's noon so
wine we waited until 5:00 okay we're
going to keep the plastic keep it classy
so yeah let's jump into it just a heads
up I am going to put every product that
I use on my face in the order that I use
it in the description box right below
this video in case I'm like rambling and
I forget to mention a product which I
can totally do um I'll have everything
listed now there for you guys if you're
curious and I apologize I keep like
drinking this drink it's like kind of
rude but I got this before I came here
to film and it's just so good I get the
caramel ice latte and I get four pumps
of sweeteners out of six because I think
it's too sweet I taste the coffee more
than the caramel caramel hmm you know me
I'm gonna start off by priming my face
and I'm going to use the Nivea men
aftershave balm and this is the
sensitive one
I know nikkietutorials is like
ride-or-die for this stuff she is
definitely the one who brought this to
the cosmetic industry um and now ton of
people are using it so I know that a lot
of people really have been loving it and
Nikki says to rub it into your skin I'm
like Nikki mom dad mom call me nikki
says to rub it into your skin until it's
nice and
because at first it really is like
extremely silky smooth and it starts to
get stickier and tackier and harder to
blend and that's when you know you good
to go oh yes I smell like a sexy man now
okay I'm going to be using the ex1 and
visit where foundation I have a little
bit of tan on right now a little bit
let's get real
I just got sprayed last night and so
this should be my perfect they'll color
I'm going to take a little bit of this
beauty oil this is by tatcha and I'm
going to put a few dabs of it like on my
actual Beauty Blender I don't know if
I'm gonna like this oh I really want to
go for like a dewy fresh face look today
with a really bold lip very neutral
minimal eye makeup and lashes
I'm just feeling that look right now so
that is the goal that I have in mind
let's see what happens I haven't used
the Beauty Blender and so long to apply
foundation and honestly like it really
is so nice it just the only thing is I
feel like I have to go over stuff a
bunch of time to get like the desired
coverage and like to even out let the
redness like if you can see right now
have a lot of redness right here between
my eyebrows and right here on my cheeks
and I feel like I have to go over those
spots over and over and over when I use
a Beauty Blender opposed to a brush like
I think I prefer brushes mole lower but
beauty blenders for under the eyes are
everything okay wow this oil smells
freaking incredible oh my god oh my god
what is that oh I want this in like a
candle this is Sun this is like the best
not oil Bevers not my life I could burn
a candle I could burn several candles of
that in my home that smells like a spa
but like the best spot or smell my life
okay okay gotcha go ahead and get me
addicted to your extremely expensive
product no big deal let's move on to
concealer I'm going to be
they make up forevers concealer and the
Ultra HD and it's the shade are 30 oh
crap that's really light no no no no no
no no no what's gonna stick to what we
know we're going to use our 32 I'm going
to mix our 32 our 30 just because I
don't want to waste well I already put
on the back of my hand so that's all a
wee bit light oh this stuff is really
really creamy and really pigmented and
it goes a long way so I don't want to
overdo it initially like we can always
add more but it's not so easy to take
stuff away okay
that is white bitch we can work with
this work with this okay it's a little
it's a little too white for me directly
there under the eyes so let me see what
I can do to fix the situation here what
I'm going to do to fix that is I'm going
to add that highlight that same
concealer in other areas of the face so
that it evens out and it doesn't look
like stark white underneath the eyes
we're going to add it to the whole under
eye area chin nose and forehead and then
it'll just make our face look
three-dimensional as opposed to looking
like we have stark white under eye area
also this morning basically I have not
wore makeup in days like I'm talking
days I had a more makeup and you know
like when you don't wear makeup for like
2 or 3 days it's one thing but when you
don't wear makeup for like a week for
some reason like you begin to look like
a man like that's what happens to me
like you have absolutely no residue left
anywhere and like you're I just get
completely lost and you're like what's
happening to me like that's how I feel
and so this morning when I woke up the
second I got out of bed what I did is I
took just like a regular eye Kohl like
an eyeliner and I lined my eyes with a
black eyeliner and I immediately just
went and washed my face and wiped it all
off and the reason I do that is these as
you can see you can see my eyes are
lined right now like tight line it's
basically just like a lazy quick way of
tight lining your eyes so you have to
take the time to do it when you're doing
makeup so that's what I did this morning
so that's why you're seeing my eyes are
lined with black I know it's so random
but these are things that we do okay so
now I'm going to take that
if you like my foundation is oxidizing a
lot darker than my neck no honey we
don't like a sealer on the chin area to
lighten that up I feel like my upper lip
looks like I have a mustache right now
which is kind of weird show I'm white
cool and then I'm going to take
concealer and put it right in the center
of my forehead because this will be my
saving grace as far as making my face
look even in the lightness that I'm
bringing you can make this look like a
pretty flower you can do whatever shape
you want
I just slop it on because when you blend
it out you're not going to be able to
see the difference so it doesn't really
matter how you initially pack that on it
really matters how you blend it out I
think I'm really bad at talking to you
guys when I'm doing my makeup about
other things like I would love to talk
to you guys about a million things right
now but I feel like as I do my makeup
all I want to do is just tell you guys
what I am doing on my face and why I'm
doing it but I need to get better at it
because I have so many requests for like
chitchat get ready with me so I just I
suck at it so this video is like my
first attempt at trying to get better at
that because I would love to do to check
it right he's with me because I think I
could film more often if I did videos
where I just talk to you guys as I did
my makeup so this is my first attempt so
we'll see what happens we'll see how I
do I know that a ton of people have been
asking me questions for the past couple
of months if you follow me on snapchat I
have shown kind of like sneak peeks of
my Beauty room and on my new office
space that I have here and a lot of
people have been asking me especially on
Twitter like what exactly this space is
why I got it what I'm using it for what
the purpose is all that jazz you know
we're all nosy that's how it is
especially as women like we have to know
every little detail I totally get that
basically a very long story short John
and I have been trying to buy a house
for hold on the me Matt back straight
we're in January John I have been
looking at houses since last December so
like 13 months ago John I started
looking for homes to actually purchase
because right now we are living in a
condo we're renting it and we actually
wanted to purchase the connor that we
lived in but our landlords want to keep
it which I totally understand because I
would want to keep it to this
here it was kind of like we just
realized that it's not meant to be like
not right now and we definitely had like
some moments of frustration because
there was at one point we thought that
we were getting a house and we were so
excited like it's my dream house there's
a backyard for the dogs and it's the
perfect amount of square footage and I
was so excited I was just like sweet and
charming it just enough space and then
what we went to go do the walk through
the whole thing fell through someone
else jumped in bought it paid cash boom
and it was just like so disappointing
but we were like you know what it's not
meant to be after being frustrated we're
like you know God has a plan and
everything always works out and so it's
just not our time to buy so maybe
sixteenth out 2016 is going to be the
year that we buy maybe it's not like
we'll find out but in the meantime John
and I are truly outgrowing our space
like we live in a condo right now and
with us get having two dogs now if our
family is growing John's drum career is
like taking off he has gotten so many
amazing opportunities recently and along
with that he has more and more equipment
all the time he has so many drum sets
now like he needs a studio to store his
drum sets really because they're in the
house in the garage and he has like two
four six eight nine he has ten drum sets
like it's in ten dogs that's no joke so
and then with all this stuff always come
in sorry be distracted I'm gonna be
going with the Carli bybel palette I'll
my just living room um I have not use
this palette yeah actually so I'm
excited to use it for the first time
today I'm going to go in with this color
I know that I want to keep the eyes nice
and neutral and I think he might be like
super super dark purple lips so I'm
gonna go with this maybe like a bump of
that and the crease we'll see okay so
anyways um try to find a brush hold on
so anyways we're just outgrowing our
space and like I have so much going on
outside of YouTube like YouTube is my
favorite thing that I do absolutely
hands down that's considered like work
but I don't consider YouTube work with
this stuff that I do outside of YouTube
is what I actually consider like my work
because this is like fun I love sitting
in front of the camera I love throwing
videos I love it I've been editing and
filming videos as a little girl like
it's always been a fun hobby for me so I
truly enjoy doing this but there's so
much other stuff going on in my life
right now
that we are truly outgrowing so along
with like the cameras and the lighting
and the backgrounds and the backdrops
and I I'm not can you guys I have like
probably five packages show at my shelf
at my house every single day for stuff
that I'm working on for like approval
stuff from labs collaborations and all
this jazz so it just got to the point
where my anxiety was getting so bad
because I was always working from home
there'd be days where like three days
would go by and I would not step outside
and I would get really bad anxiety and I
struggle with something called D
realization which um my throat gets
tight just talking about it because it
sucks but anyways I'm if any of you out
there and then have struggle with D
realization you know what it is like I'm
right there with you it freaking sucks
but anyways so my D realization was
getting horrible and basically just
means that you feel like you're very
foggy and you just feel like you're kind
of in a dream state and your mind isn't
clear and I was in therapy about a year
ago you guys didn't know but I was in
therapy three times a week Wallace here
on YouTube and my I'm done now like I
just went for like eight months maybe
eight months to a year I think and
during that period anyway so long story
short she recommended to me that I
really really really need to like
separate my home life from my work life
because it was really causing horrible
anxiety and many of you who work from
home and like you have your own at-home
business I'm sure you completely
understand what I'm talking about
because you never know when to shut off
work and turn on like relaxation time so
it would literally be 2:00 in the
morning and I would be like in my makeup
room at my desk like approving things
and writing emails and John wick
Jacqueline's 2:00 in the morning I never
knew how to turn it off so now I have an
office space in Oh joke a quarter mile
away and I get to come here Monday
through Friday and I get to do
everything work-related here like this
is where I come to have phone calls
meetings approvals like lab submissions
everything now happens here and I now
have a space for all of my fan mail I
don't have that clients fan mail but my
mail from you guys my subscribers I have
like an entire huge walk-in closet it's
all of that I actually it's like look at
it and see it like before it was like
crammed like in the because I didn't
have any room and now I have a dedicated
Beauty room with all my stuff out my
lights I'm just
so happy here you guys I'm just so I
could cry I've cried several times just
so happy to have this space I just feel
so lucky now and now I feel no pressure
to rush and buy a house because I have
like my work space I have my YouTube
space and then I have my home and
honestly like even though I love YouTube
so much like the past eight months
filming has been a very big stress in my
life just because it takes up so much
room in my space that we're already
outgrowing and now like the past two
days I have been so excited to film like
more excited than I've been in a year
like I have been so excited to come here
because it's just me up all by myself I
have so much room I'm just so happy to
have this space so for those of you
wondering like exactly what's going on
and I'm going to do my makeup at this
point I'm just babbling that is what
this whole beauty space is all about
like I said it's literally right down
the street so it's basically like a home
away from home which night might not be
healthy but it is and I absolutely love
it
these shadows are not as soon as Carli
bybel palette I like these these are
really really blendable honestly in this
palette when I got it I was shocked by
how lightweight it is like I wish I
could tell you guys how light it is
because it's couple sorry Carly honest
it's all I'm going to do to my eyes I'm
just gonna walk away because I'll get to
smokey two sooner I want to do that when
I went very basic eyes cuz I'm base look
by the way this background like the
wallpaper is permanent but we are I'm
getting AB and V right here so I have a
vanity here with like some flowers and
I'm actually putting like bling like
actual like rhinestone bling on this
wallpaper which I'm so excited about um
I'm also thinking about getting to I
actually already got them two small
sconces to hang like little chandeliers
to hang on the wall like right here what
do you guys think of that if I have like
two lights like pretty chandeliers
hanging right here on the wall and they
like frame my face like a vanity and my
flowers do you think that that'll look
good I think it'll look pretty but I
also don't want it to look like hello
and welcome back to like home decor but
Jaclyn like this is not the only
background
using this room though I have like a
vanity over there I have a desk over
here so I'll switch it up this isn't
like the only background I'll use but
this is just one of three that you will
see this is not good
ah my eyebrows were looking more like
bushes not brows so I've been getting a
lot of people asking me if I'm going to
be at IMAX LA this year and there's a
long story behind this but short version
of the story I'm actually going to be in
LA the exact weekend of IMAX so I'm
going to be there for business stuff
that I have been planning since October
basically I'm going to be there for like
six days and my schedule is Sol and like
what I did is I scheduled like six days
out in LA and I'm using like every day
to do something that needs to be done in
LA like I'm going to different places
and people it's awkward cuz I can't
really say everything that I'm doing
because it's stuff that you guys will
see later in the year but basically I'm
going to be there over IMAX and I want
to go to IMAX and I want to see you guys
but I also don't want to piss IMAX off
because last year there was like a lot
of drama with everyone getting kicked
out and like I went in there and I was
only inside of IMATS for like what six
minutes and had to leave and go outside
and people were upset people were
tweeting at me like you know this is so
wrong you should be able to come at the
same time I completely understand that
IMAX doesn't want youtubers coming in
and causing huge lines and chaos and
then like people can't shop and IMAX
doesn't make money because like it's
like fire hazard and all that so I don't
want to upset IMATS in any way so
basically I do plan on going if IMAX
allows so I am trying to figure that out
on my end of things um and I'm in
contact hoping that I can go there and
see you guys I will of course update you
on snapchat and Twitter and let you know
but I'm not going to sit here and say
I'm going to be I'm at Saturday at 1
o'clock because I don't know if I'm at
says we don't want you here
I'm not going to go look I'm going to
respect that but I will
let you guys know on snap and Twitter
either way if you guys follow me there
of course my snapchat information our
information is always down below the
bottom bar okay I'm going to grab my my
baby
this is my baby I don't know what to
call it it's just my baby I snapped
about this palette I took the time last
week to sit down and no joke go through
every single eyeshadow that I have in my
collection I say single I'm talking like
singles like magnetic eyes shadows and
create a jumbo palette of like my
absolute favorite go to can't live
without eye shadows and that's what this
palette is right here so as you can see
it's like literally my favorite colors
ever so I have a ton of requests from
you guys to do a video going through
each and every shadow and I will totally
do that for you guys later this month if
you really want it you know I'll do it
so I'm going to reach in here and grab
Mac nylon which is the first one in
there I can't live without a bag
knighthood I'm gonna pop that on my
inner corner to get some bang and
highlight go away I don't know why I get
so much satisfaction doing this mozi
Palace where you go oh I don't know why
okay so I'm actually gonna run into this
Carli bybel palette I'm going to pick up
this highlight right down here this like
second one that's kind of yeah it's a
highway to cheek highway I believe and
I'm going to just put a little bit of
this right here on the inner corner of
the eye and just kind of fade it out so
that we have not too much I don't wanna
bring it all over the eye just kind of
the inner corner and then it'll kind of
fade away
oh I'm going to get this thing called
the cool laser treatment in LA it's like
a facial and I'm so excited I made my
appointment yesterday I feel like
everyone in there mom has gotten this
treatment and I'm just so excited um
anyways so it's like a cool it's a good
actual laser and it's supposed to help
with dark spots and like
hyperpigmentation and fine lines and you
guys I am so excited to get this because
I have so many sunspots like this one
right here I can never actually cover it
no matter how much makeup I put I I did
some damage to my
when I was younger I worked in a tanning
salon for a year and a half not to
mention I was like a sunbathing goddess
I was obsessed and I wish you straight
baby oil it's so bad you guys and now
like as a 25 year old I have so many
lines in my skin and I have so many
sunspots coming through and it sucks but
that's why you protect yourself
seriously like I started protecting my
skin when I was like 19 to 20 but from
like 13 to 18 it was bad so I don't know
if the cool laser treatment is actually
gonna help or was just a gimmick but I
have friends who got it done they say
that it's amazing so we'll find out what
am I doing with my life
okay so I do not have any bronzer out on
the table let me find one okay I'm going
to be contouring the face with the Kat
Von D shade light palette okay I heard a
rumor I'm hoping it's true because I
will probably put myself and that is
these are coming out in individuals like
magnetic singles that you can buy
separately and if that's true Oh finally
like prayers have been answered because
I've been saying I want this in a single
for so long this is true I will no joke
buy at least three to four of these just
right off the bat because this is my
favorite under I like yellow banana
powder of all time so for contour I'm
going to use the morphe m-52 3 i know
this is like the weirdest shaped brush
for contour but i think this is my
favorite contour brush that i've ever
used
i don't know what it's technically made
for but that's what i use it for so i'm
going to use just this center color
right here just a little dab'll do ya
and recently I have been using I have
been a little little rude remind
recently I have been applying my contour
higher-than-normal
I used to kind of go like this from the
corner I would bring it down like
straight like this and kind of swoop
recently I've been bringing it like a
centimeter higher and it really has been
making a difference as far as making my
cheekbones higher so I've been doing
this in the past couple of months I've
really been liking it so much more damn
this is intense see that's what I'm
saying
this brush look at how sharp that edges
look at how sharp you would not think
that this
if you add that sharp but it does it's
amazing yes I guess this is honestly
such a good contour shade which is a
little bit of this on the hairline okay
I'm going to go in with lashes I'm going
to be using these who are these even by
I bought these online when I was in
Chicago glossy makeup by Natasha Zakir
and these are in the style Chelsea I
wore these in my December favorites
video and tons of people were commenting
that they loved my makeup and then it
seemed so like natural glam and I think
it's because of these lashes I purchase
them online because I saw someone post
them on Instagram and I was like oh that
looks cool and I just bought a couple
bears and I really really liked them
these have a clear like flimsy band kind
of like the demi wispies from the
drugstore um which some people love some
people hate I'm kind of indifferent to
it but they do have that clear band I
personally think that makes it a little
bit more difficult to get them on the
eyes but once they're on they are more
comfortable that's the way I feel about
the clear band situation
so this is what the lashes look like now
they're on as you can see they are very
dramatic and wispy but they're not heavy
like they're not dense they're not going
to cast a shadow and make your eyes look
small in room say I'm going to put some
mascara on my lower lashes to kind of
balance out these long lashes on top
now for blush I'm going to use this
matte blush in the shade
Spellbinder I just got this from one of
their collections I don't know what
collection it was I can't keep up with
Mac collections anymore like I'm not as
good as it as I used to be um no matter
newer collections I just got it in the
mail yesterday I'm going to pop a little
bit of that took a really nice
corely pink I'm going to take a little
highlight and pop it at the high point
of my brow
okay so now I'm going to highlight my
cheeks and I am so excited to try these
new anastacio glow kits have you guys
seen these like on insta Burt oh my god
I'm so excited to try them I think she
told me that these are not the final
packaging or something I'm not quite
sure and this one is that glow which is
kind of like a bronzy like really nice
summer highlight kit right here the
shades are all like a little bit warmer
and then here this is called gleam and
this is more like cool tone and a little
bit more like springy so pretty so oh
god I don't know what I want to use
there's three options I literally don't
know what the heck to use okay so I'm
going to go in with the gleam glow kit
and use crushed pearl let's see how I
have not used these yet I have
absolutely no idea how they are this is
my first time using it I just got them
so oh yes honey yes you guys see like
all my breakouts right now all those
little texture bumps that's what happens
to me I don't get like ooze II pimples I
get texture like right now I have all
this texture on my cheeks I don't know
what's going on I woke up with it
yesterday and I'm like thank you so
sweet you know
I'm gonna grab just a little bit of
bubbly to go on top of it from that glow
because I feel like I feel like that's
really like icy on me girl I'm adding so
much highlight oh my god
I'm just going like a beat on my news
okay so now I'm going to go in with the
lip and I want to do a wipe off my
chapstick I just got the Maybelline
vivid and matte lip collection sent to
me this is like the Maybelline liquid
lipstick I haven't tried them yet so I
thought I would try this and this is in
the shade possessed plum number 50
it doesn't seem to be drying right now
but it says it's a vivid matte liquid
lipstick so I'm hoping it's going to get
matte soon okay so I've been sitting
here waiting for about three minutes and
it is not drying Matt it's just saying
super glossy um which is fine but not
for this color I don't want it to be
glossy so I'm going to block this off
and go in with the Anastacio utopia not
utopia potion let's try this again
and the anastasi one is mouth mass at
the
I don't think you guys can actually ever
understand how long it takes for me to
do liquid lipstick literally a full 10
minutes of carving out these lips like
everything you see right here this is
all fake like for some reason this side
of my mouth has so much more lip and
this one is just like no I'm sorry so I
have to like bring this down and fake it
so much and keep this one like nice and
tight and following the natural line
it's a process but I'm constantly like
getting up close and like scooting back
and getting them closed and scoot back
to constantly see because my lips are
just so uneven but anyways first of all
problems let's move on my camera did die
at the very end not die but it stopped
recording at the very end because it
records in of 20 minute segments I did
set my face with the makeup forever mist
and fix setting spray great setting
spray when I go forever and a lot of
professional makeup artists love this I
used to use it like crazy back in the
day but this is just going to help with
the longevity of your makeup
it'll help moisturize and it'll also
make your powder not look as powdery so
everything looks a wee bit more natural
also I have been meaning to tell you
guys about this and it just keeps
slipping my mind but be tatcha luminous
dewy skin miss you guys I have been so
in love with this product for such a
long time now and I think that it is
honest to god the best dewy skin mists
of all time like two sprays and that's
all you need but something that I've
noticed is that if I have on eyeliner or
mascara especially a lot of it and I
spray this on my face it only takes
about five minutes and my eyeliner in my
mascara is going to start transferring
like down here I'll get tons of black
dots under my eye it'll transfer up here
my brow bone so what I do is I will
actually grab it a palette like this
cover my I spray my cheek cover my I
spray my cheek cover my eyes spray my
forehead and that way
this never actually comes in contact
with your eyes so your eye makeup stays
in place but the rest of your face can
look nice and dewy so you can just use
your hands cover your eye like that but
that's just something a tip that I
wanted to give you guys some sure some
of you have experienced it as well so
just cover your eyes and spray and
you'll be good to go I've even had John
like skin behind
before I just go like this as I spray my
face on my face all right you guys so
that is it for this video I really hope
that you enjoy I loved making this video
for you I think these are my favorite
videos to fill honestly at least one of
them other than favorites videos
favorite video is my favorite but I
think this is my second favorite because
it's just so easy like just sitting down
talking to you hanging out getting ready
like it just feels very natural to me so
yes I hope that you enjoy if you did let
me know and I will totally incorporate
more of these on my channel especially
now that I will have like this space for
it and like it's just so great like I
want to make John can you leave the
house Sean can you go to this because if
John is home and I'm filming I feel very
uncomfortable because we live in a small
condo and so we can hear everywhere I'm
saying I feel so awkward like talking to
the camera when John is like doing stuff
out there so now I have my own space
like it's just great like I think I can
be as loud as I want I can scream if I
want no one's here it's just me I have
all the room in the world so with that
being said let me know what type of
videos you want to see if you want to
see like more chitchat get ready if you
want to just let me know and I'm open to
whatever so yeah that's it I hope you
enjoy I love you guys I'll be back with
my best of beauty video next which is
gonna be a long one so be pretty pet
alright that's it I'm done babbling I
love you guys and I'll see you later bye
