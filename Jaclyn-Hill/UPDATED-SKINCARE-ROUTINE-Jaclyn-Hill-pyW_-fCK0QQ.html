video in over a week at this point if
you follow me on Instagram and you know
that I have been out of town on location
in Miami Florida I was there for five
days doing insane photo shoot I was so
exhausted you have absent no idea I
worked my butt off while I was there the
first three days I was there and I got
six hours of sleep in total no joke the
first night I slept for 11 minutes 11
minutes like I would be dramatic to say
that I got 40 minutes of sleep at night
it was insane my alarm went off at 1:45
in the morning and I was up for the day
it was exhausting so with that being
said I miss you guys I missed it all so
I was going to film a makeup tutorial
for you guys today even though the
thought of makeup right now just makes
me want to cry because I've been like
beaten with makeup brushes the past five
days um but I actually left my personal
makeup I left a bunch of it at my mom's
house on the way traveling back home I
stopped there when I got back home and
then I left it all her place long story
short I had to do my own makeup with my
freelance kit today which I really don't
like to do so I don't like using that
makeup I like keeping it in my freelance
so um anyways I can't talk I told you I
was exhausted my voice is cutting in and
out getting to the point I'm going to be
doing an updated skincare video for you
guys today this is an extremely
requested video since I didn't have my
makeup I figured I had to do something
else so I looked at the comments and you
know just stuff that you guys are always
saying me and you are constantly asking
for an updated skincare video so I'm not
going to bore you anymore I'm going to
jump right into it
first and foremost washing your face
obviously is an extremely important
thing to do you should be washing your
face every single morning and every
single night a lot of people tell me
that they don't wash their face in the
morning because they feel like they've
just been sleeping and they don't see
the big deal I think it is just as
important to wash your face 3:00 in the
morning than it is at nighttime first of
all you will notice a very big
difference in your makeup application if
you were washing your skin in the
morning and then moist
it's going to almost act like a primer
it's going to remove the dirt and
bacteria from sleeping when you sleep
your body sweats and it goes through a
cycle and it actually releases bacteria
and toxins in that sweat your pores open
you go through some stuff when you're
sleeping and in that time nasty stuff is
going to come out of your skin that's
why a lot of times if you eat really
unhealthy you'll wake up with a pimple
because your body is doing stuff and
it's turning its wheels while you're
sleeping and in that time you're going
to have stuff come to the surface so in
the morning as soon as I wake up I brush
my teeth I wash my face I'm voice tries
to get my skin prepared for the day I am
obsessed with purity face wash I have
talked about this so many times this is
my second or third bottle as you can see
it's gigantic I think it's $30 for the
jumbo bottle which this is obviously it
is the price on it no but I got mine
from Nordstrom that's where I try to get
everything I pretty much can because I
think Nordstrom is a great company with
a great return policy in case you don't
love something so this is a one-stop
shop it's a one-step facial cleanser it
cleans your skin removes bacteria and pH
balances so pH balancing means that you
don't have to necessarily tone your skin
and your face afterwards if you don't
want to I personally do but you don't
have to it really does remove all the
makeup is awesome so this is why I use
in the morning I use the Perry face wash
I also use this in the evening time as
well but right now I'm just going to
tell you guys what it is that I use I
have tons of skincare products that I
use every once in a while but in this
video I'm gonna tell you where I use all
the time that is you know continuous so
this is every morning and every night as
of right now and in the morning I
actually which is just surprising I
actually use the origins ginseng energy
boosting moisturizer it looks like this
I think this is fairly new because I see
posters about it everywhere I go it is
absolutely amazing it smells like
oranges Oh smells so citrusy it makes me
crave like an orange slushie Starbucks
has those new orange like
refreshers you haven't had them huh
they are amazing smells so good so I use
this as in all the face moisturizer now
remember I am dry but this is you can
apply am or PM that it's hydrating it
says a lot about hydration on here and
an energy booster I heard that it's
supposed like you know reduce fine lines
and wrinkles and collagen and plump it
up and stuff like that you know I feel
like every moisturizer pretty much says
that though but I am really really
really happy with that it's not sticky
it's not greasy but yeah it's not too
thin where I don't feel moisturize I
just love it and I think that when I
apply it I usually apply my foundation
very quickly afterwards and I just love
it it makes my foundation go on so
smooth so hydrating I have know that it
is lightening my skin a little bit so it
probably has some vitamin C in it which
doesn't say on here I'm suing it does
because it is brightening my face a
little bit so just be warned about that
this right here is the eye cream this is
as well origins this is the only two
origins thing as things I have this is
the ginseng refreshing eye cream to
Brighton and D puffs oh my gosh you guys
this is honestly the best eye cream I've
ever used it is so awesome it has like
this brightening effect to it it's like
a light beige e with a little bit of
pink and when it goes on if you're gonna
be able to see but can you see how it
actually has a brightening effect I
don't know if you can and I have makeup
on my hand my hands are probably stained
in the last week I'm never going to have
nice hands again
um but it has this brightening effect
that even when I'm not wearing makeup
but I put it on I'll put a I like a V
around my eye it'll have this really
pretty glow in that area it's not just
any eye cream it's awesome it is so
hydrating and makes my concealer
especially pro longwear concealer from
Mac it's such a dry formula and
consistency that when you put it on over
top of this eye cream it's like butter
loads
see told you my voice is in a crack okay
moving on pretty much as all I've been
doing for daytime recently because I've
really really been loving these things
and this pH balances so I don't want to
need a toner for the daytime anyways my
skin has just been very satisfied with
cleansing moisturizing an eye cream for
the daytime and it's simple and I'm
happy with that so I'm going to go into
the other products that I use in the
nighttime I kind of jump back and forth
between this is where the main of my
skincare comes in I'm very picky about
what I put on my skin at the night
because I do realize I'm going to have
it on for probably eight hours because I
tend I achieved my face about an hour or
two before I go to sleep at least I not
that person who had waddles the bathroom
of my eyes closed splashes a lot of my
face and jumps in bed I usually wash my
face an hour or two before I go to sleep
and then I let those skin care products
soak in before I put my face on my
pillow so I'm very picky about what I'm
gonna let sit on my skin for you know
six eight ten hours
well that was Miami and be a lot of
minutes anyways at nighttime I continue
to use the same purity base wash this is
all I've been using recently there is a
josie maran cleansing oil that I have in
my bathroom I really like that one but I
have not been using it all recently
because I just love purity especially in
the summer months I'm not as insanely
dry and I just I love love this love
this okay so with that being said in the
email time I do use one of two toners
depending how I'm feeling that my skin
is doing that day this is the aroma
water from lush it's called toner water
it's a gentle rose and lavender tonic
for everyday use to helps hydrate skin
sends it or mortar scan without causing
it to overreact so it just looks like
this just spray so you just spray it
directly on the face they told me that I
can use it over top of my makeup um I
don't really need to though because I
have so many other sprays to set my
makeup and hydrate overtop of it so this
is just a nice toner it is so gentle it
smells good
nice widespread and across the face it
just feels very very refreshing and it's
very mild it doesn't have any like
alcohol or tingling in it it's just a
very soft toner I really really love it
pretty inexpensive too
so then sometimes I also use my Mario
Badescu cucumber cleansing lotion this
is as well a toner this is for
combination to oily skin which is funny
because I am very dry but the reason I
use this is because once or twice a week
I will use this instead of the Roma
water just because I will feel like I'm
getting some clogged pores or I'll feel
somewhat under the skin bumps you know
those things I haven't truly come to the
surface yet but they're still down there
I'll feel some of those coming and I'll
feel like okay I need to back off all my
extremely like oil packs and rich thick
moisturizers and kind of strip
everything out of my pores and start
fresh and that's where I'll use this
corks I feel like when I use this it
kind of doesn't burn but it kind of does
in a good way and it just smells like
whoo like it just kind of smells like a
hospital like very sterile oh hey the
way Hospital smell don't know why I
refer to that morbid okay but anyways I
just really like this for there's a
couple times a week I'll use this on a
cotton pad I always use a thin round
cotton pad not a cotton ball as with
cotton balls messy and it takes too much
product and it's just it's a mess so I
always use a cotton pad that's thin I
rub it all over my face of course
excluding my eyes and I just really get
really penetrates deep and afterwards I
will feel like my skin is tight and like
oh that just took out any oil I had but
it's a good feeling because then I can
take everything out and go in and
restore that oil with the products so
with that being said this is totally
random I wish on my friend that's and
she was like what this is a serum from
lush and they give you this little jar
keep it in and it's literally a serum
now
it melts all the time just because my
I was just so warm and you're like
remould like according to the jar but
when it comes it's just like target
explained it just comes like a block and
it's a serum and when you rub it on the
skin the moment you put on your skin on
contract it just begins to melt
you know you might see the du Venus but
just begins to melt and this is a serum
she told me that this is what's used
after your toner and before your
moisturizer I do not know what it's
called something mushroom they only have
like two or three of them I think but
it's something mushroom and she said it
was for very dry skin it is amazing I
love this stuff so much I would just
recommend this to anybody with any skin
to go get one of these serums from lush
it comes in a bar totally random but
what I do is I will wash my face tone
and then I will take this and I will
just rub a little bit just like a swipe
here a swipe here and a swipe on my
forehead and then I will take a josie
maran 100% pure argan oil I finally got
the big bottle after going through like
seven of the little ones I finally was
like oh by it I need it and I'll take a
little drop of this and I'll rub it all
together it is so luxurious my skin
feels so hydrated afterwards this argan
oil is amazing it's not going to clog
your pores it's all organic all natural
weally people can use this dry people
can use this combination can use this I
know that a lot of oily people do not
like to use oil and always lend my or
the customers to try using an oil before
they go to bed at night and they never
understand why but it's kind of when
people are extremely oiled they try to
go so far the opposite direction they
try to dry their skin up so much that
they're actually going to make
themselves even oily or by trying to
suck it all out if you put some natural
oil back into your skin it will kind of
convince your face like oh we don't you
produce so much oil because we're
getting oil now and it'll stop being so
extremely oily so I told a lot of oily
customers about that and they've gotten
back to me a month or two later
tell me like oh my gosh argan oil really
did work I'm not as oily anymore so it's
a really great product I suggested to
everyone it can do no wrong it can be
used for your whole body your hair your
cuticles whatever you want it's not just
for the face so multi-purpose product
actually amazing and that can be found
at Sephora all these things I'm
mentioning are either at Nordstrom
Sephora or lush everything I'm
mentioning other than origins origins is
online and in origin stores I'll put the
links below for you guys so don't you
worry my friends okay also an item I use
a different eye cream I use the serum
eye herbal eye cream I don't know how I
made this last so long this is the same
eye cream I mentioned in my last video
which was like a year ago
um it is still completely in there I
don't know how is it lasted so long I
use it every single night I might have
missed a couple of nice I use it every
single night now you don't have to use
this eye cream if you're using a josie
maran argan oil you can use this as your
eye cream because it's natural but I use
this I really really love this it's very
hydrating it's not too thick it's for
all skin types which is a very
moisturizing cooling feeling same with
the origins it truly does be fresh it
almost not minty but it has like it just
feels like a breath of fresh air it's
hard to explain but they both just feel
so refreshing on the skin this one is
super inexpensive I think it's like
twelve dollars or something and it's
last meal I think it's been a year I'm
not kidding it's been a long time at
nighttime I also use the caviar night
cream this is again my Mario Badescu
this is for dry and sensitive skin it is
paste this stuff is thick thick thick I
would only recommend this zone who's dry
it is so luxurious though but like it's
literally you can see like my finger
nail prints in there because it is
seriously thick stuff but it feels so
good it is like butter it is luxury and
a jar when I put it on my face I'll wake
up in the morning and just be like
and my makeup goes on so smooth and yes
believe it or not there actually are
nights where I do that whole routine
I will tone with this to suck out all my
oil and I will go in with this serum the
Josie Maran
in the caviar night creme there's nice
eyes you at all now that's probably one
night a week but when I do that and I
wake up in the morning it's no joke like
I am a new woman and between that I use
my ocean salt scrub from lush this is a
face and body scrub as an exfoliator I
use this probably four to five days a
week I am so dry that I exploit all the
time the color is so pretty I just love
this color every time I open I'm like
huh smells like straight sea salt now I
did mention before in my previous video
that I do yours use organic sugar to
exfoliate and I still do I use the
organic sugar for my whole body and then
from time to time I'll use organic sugar
mixed with extra virgin I'll virgin
olive oil because it is just very
moisturizing very good for your skin
doesn't clog my pores so on and so forth
but this right here I really really love
this for my skin I just think it's great
and I don't know why I have been using
this instead of the sugar on my face I
don't have a I don't know explanation
for you I just have I've just been
really enjoying this so that's that okay
one more thing in there this is called
the love lettuce fresh face mask this is
from lush right here this is a mask I
have been absolutely adoring for dry
skin I love this there's another one by
them and it's oatmeal and it literally
smells like oatmeal when I was in lush
finance with my husband and the girl in
there was like I actually eat this mask
from time to time and my husband was
like and he had no idea where we were
and his reaction was hilarious so we
love to explain to him like everything
in there is natural and organic and
fresh and homemade he was like oh my god
I thought that girl was just and they're
talking about eating a face cream so
silly story anyways I love love this
mask she told me it's for dry sensitive
skin
has lavender oil in it it it has so many
good things in a glycerin almond oil
honey lavender it's just full of good
stuff it's very exploiting it dries to a
very hard mask it's just like this green
color and then when you wash it off it
exfoliates big-time it has little chunks
of almonds in it so when you exploit it
really really gets it off when you're
washing your face so that's that last
product I just want to mention to you
guys in general I absolutely love this
this is the Josie Maran Argan infinity
cream intensive creamy oil I love this
cream it is so luxurious I don't use
this on my face a lot because as you saw
I have so many other products they're so
rich and thick but this one I just love
I love if my hands are truly dry or my
elbows are extremely dry even if you
really want to moisturize your chest
area I haven't shaved my decollete being
dry and it gets super super red I'm sure
it's red right now I'm looking in the
camera and its got like redness right in
here it's always red so because of that
I love to use this moisturizer it's
thick it's creamy but it does absorb
very fast so I love this makes your skin
glow and looks so healthy this is
something you could use instead of the
argan oil on the face and the body if
you really want to I just love in the
line I can't say enough good things
about her she's just she's friggin
awesome anyways so this is my last part
I want to mention I really hope that you
guys enjoyed this video I'm sorry my
brain is like all over the place I have
not back together yet oh no it's in the
Thunder as I go run errands say okay so
yes I will see you guys in the next
video I really hope you enjoy have a
wonderful week I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
