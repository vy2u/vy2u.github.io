not okay hey guys feel so good to be
back oh my gosh I cannot believe how
long I have gone without filming and
then not to mention just being like out
of my element in New York City I feel
like I have not filmed in like a month I
am super excited to be filming this
video today I see that meeting every
single intro like it does not matter I'm
talking about like I could be talking
about cat poop and I'm like I am so
excited but I swear like I really do
love filming and I actually am excited
to film every video so I'm super excited
for today's video because I'm going to
just be basically updating you on my
life on lots of questions I've gotten
recently just random stuff you know I
feel like in so many of my videos I'm so
fast-paced and it's all about like
makeup and I talked 5000 miles an hour
and it's like and I feel like I'm such a
teacher sometimes that I just felt like
I needed to sit down with you guys like
one-on-one and just chill so like grab a
glass of wine grab a snack cuz I
basically just wanna hang out with you
guys I want to catch up with you my
intent in this video is just to talk to
you about a lot of stuff that's been
going on and then you guys can leave me
comments down below and we can chitchat
about stuff that we talked about you
know I'm saying I want to do what girls
do today so recently I have just been
feeling not very inspired when it comes
to makeup like I go through phases where
I'm like so inspired and just like I can
literally see a tree in my car
I see this look in my eyes but right now
I'm in this rut where I'm just like
everything just feels redundant and like
it's been done before and just like
typical and I'm just kind of in a rut
and this happens to me almost every
single year for a month or so where I
just feel like wow and I'm in that right
now so I'm not ashamed to admit that and
so I just thought that getting on camera
talking to you guys just kind of
reconnecting with you will re inspire me
again to make makeup looks and tutorials
and come up with creative ideas no I'm
saying this is just kind of like my
happy place to kind of reboot and
recharge my battery like I truly feel
like I have built a friendship with my
subscribers and sometimes I just wanna
sit down and chill with you so that's
what we're doing today let me just say
right now sweating ass like just just so
much sweat just
it's intense that's what my hair is up
because it is so hot like in New York
City I was like it's so cold I hate this
place when I got back home to Florida I
liked it so if you bet I hate this place
so the first subject that I just want to
talk about and just move right along it
is I'm at there has been so many
questions about what went on with IMATS
and what's going to happen in the future
with IMATS so basically a very long
story short oh my husband is walking
upstairs it makes me feel oh my gosh I'm
such a dork anyways long story short I'm
max no longer once beauty bloggers or
youtubers or you know people on
Instagram and tons of followers to be
IMAX not because of them not because of
their following but because they are
creating such a large crowd of girls
that is intruding with their procedures
their rules as far as like their fire
codes and things like that and people
are being able to get to the booze and
shop because there's such large crowds
they want to keep these youtubers there
they want to keep these beauty bloggers
there they're trying to make it work
like they were moving tons of us around
trying to find different places for us
to stand to make it work but I
understand I really do because even
though it drives the ticket sales and
like people are buying so many tickets
because they know that they're gonna get
to meet you know like someone that they
follow on Instagram or Twitter or
YouTube irreverent maybe I understand
that part but it is international makeup
artist tradeshow so I also understand
their side in the sense that this is not
like a youtubers place we cannot just
walk in here and be like boom bitch get
out the way I'll take it over you know
what I'm saying like this is IMATS and
they can create their rules as far as
what they want and if they don't want
this huge crowd of people swarming and
blocking booze that's all on them I just
personally think that someone needs to
create like a YouTube event where all
these people can come and just strictly
meet and hang out with youtubers it's
like honestly someone out there needs to
do that
needs to create something along the
lines of IMAX or beautycon but just
literally places with backdrops and food
and just places for someone to like tons
of people just to come and hang out like
I swear like we need that so bad so
that's the deal with iMac it's not that
they hate youtubers or they hate beauty
bloggers or makeup artists or whatever
it may be it's just they're causing very
large crowds and every year it's getting
bigger
I'm bigger and bigger and it's making it
harder and harder and harder for people
to shop and get to booze and they're
breaking like fire codes and conduct and
stuff like that so that's to deal with
I'm at so going forward I don't know if
I'll be attending imax anymore just
because of the rules but we're gonna
figure something out we're gonna figure
something oh I'm talking so much with my
hands today and I think it's secretly
because my armpits are sweating so bad
that I'm trying to be like a windmill
over here and just cool myself off
honestly I'm just gonna be real
tell the people my sister just asked me
what's the difference between a tinted
moisturizer and a BB cream girl I got
you tons of people have been wondering
if I am still planning on doing a video
with my husband John and yes girl I am I
tweeted a couple weeks ago that him and
I we're gonna be filming a husband does
my makeup tag or challenge whatever it's
called and then we didn't get around to
it because John got extremely busy as
you busy oh oh you got extremely busy
doing stuff in the studio he is a
drummer you gotta do the hand motions
otherwise you wouldn't know her drummer
is right and then I have been extremely
busy with my schedule plus we both went
to New York so it's just been a lot but
we are planning on filming next week
sometime between Monday and Wednesday no
no I'm sorry I just lied that is not
true because he has to do his thing on
when listen we're gonna film next week
okay we're gonna film next week he's
gonna do my makeup and it's gonna be up
with him probably ten days at the most
okay what's next what's the next okay
I'm about to talk about the most asked
question in the world I ready dumb dumb
to mix my skincare hands-down the most
asked question on all social media is my
skincare what does my current skincare
routine and I know I had not even
mentioned skincare and like a favorite
video and so along I know but I'm gonna
explain that right now in the reason why
long story short I was bitching and
complaining on camera for quite some
time about my face my texture my trying
it
and I've had enough so basically my
brother and mother-in-law it's my
brother's wife's mom she basically feels
like my second mom because my brother
and his wife had been married since I
was a wee little tot cuz he's 11 years
ordering me so she is an aesthetician
and amazing aesthetician she's been
doing it for like almost 30 years she's
won tons of awards and so last year I
was like you know what I'm gonna take
advantage of her being a part of my
family I'm like I'm gonna take advantage
of this woman you guys are like whoa TMI
I think I'm gonna take advantage of her
be and my family and I'm gonna go talk
to her about my skin so I went I talked
to her she like gave me a consultation
as if like I was a client and not family
it was amazing she gave me a facial and
we sat there for like three and a half
hours one afternoon and just dissected
my skin and talked all about it and all
that jazz so when I walked out of there
I ended up buying this skin care called
Sanitas and this is all I have used ever
since and I haven't talked about it
really for any other reason other than
it can be kind of hard to get your hands
on it can be really difficult some
things are like a very some things I can
average price and something that a
skincare line are very pricy for me
personally skincare like I would pretty
much sell my soul skincare is the most
important thing in my face routine it's
what's going on my face the most it's
more important than anything else and if
you don't have a good base you don't
have a good face I think it's pretty
obvious why skincare is so important
your makeup is only gonna look as good
as what's underneath and I'm sorry I'm
literally picking my nose right now but
my allergies are not cute I'm finally
starting to learn snapchat and I'm
feeling so proud of myself just saying
so you can see how many people
screenshot and it was something like
2,500 people screenshotted the picture
that I posted of my skincare so I was
like young people are interested so I
thought that would go ahead and talk
about it I will totally do an entire
skincare routine for you guys if you
want but I just thought that I would
tell you guys what it is that I am using
Sanitas is a full huge lion they have it
for everyone they have it for acne for
dry skin for combination skin up
everything you can think of so she
basically did a consultation with me did
her thing and then she told me what it
is that I needed so I am using many two
things I'm using the vitamin C serum
plus I'm using the pep peptide anti
aging serum my favorite moisturizer that
I've ever used in my entire life is
right here and it's the oil-free
moisturizer and it said it's for type
combination oily so when she gave this
to me I was like I do not want oil-free
I am NOT combination I'm not oily she's
like trust me your skin needs this well
it is a very thick very moisturizing
very rich buttery moisturizer but I
pumped like one or two pumps in my hand
I put it on my face and I look dewy
almost to the point of greasy but within
10 minutes my skin now looks completely
normal it absorbs but yeah it feels so
good and I'm telling you since I've been
using this as someone who's dry at my
makeup my foundation has never laid
better like there's something about this
oil-free moisturizer that I'm obsessed
with and the other product that I'm like
she just introduced this to me on Easter
but I've been using it every single day
since then and I'm just like yeah and
this is the Sanitas brightening peel
pads and it's literally like there's
probably like 200 pads in here oh my
gosh this has like every good acid in it
that you can think of and I am crazy
sensitive so when she gave this to me on
Easter she's like be careful because
this might make your skin irritated coz
I am so over-the-top sensitive but it
hasn't hasn't irritated me at all and it
gently exfoliates and it makes your skin
so bright like I don't even want to wear
makeup some days because I'm like my
skin just looks radiating so that is
that those are the main things I've been
using I have quite a few products from
Sunita speaks in us because they have
just been everything you usually have to
get them like by a aesthetician at a spa
and things like that you know we're like
at a salon but this isn't something that
you're typically gonna you're not gonna
ever find actually in like a Sephora or
anything like that so if you guys are in
the Tampa area I'm going to put my I
call her my mother-in-law but she's not
but whatever I'm gonna put her
information down below for you guys and
you guys can give her a call if you're
in the tampa area and go see her if
you're interested in the most
life-changing facial of all time she is
revamping her website right now so I
don't have like a website for you guys
but when I do have her website I will
share with this is super duper random
but this is something too
asked about since I started YouTube and
I don't know why but I've never talked
about it it's like it's so done coupe
earrings I have three boxes of these
we've just filled with hoop earrings if
you know anything about me
hoop earrings hoop earrings and leather
jackets that's like I swear those two
things define me since I was like 13
years old hoop earrings and other
jackets so tons of people always ask me
where it is I get my hoop earrings so I
thought that I was go ahead and tell you
guys
Claire's it's that easy I'm not kidding
I get my hoop earrings at Claire's
they've all different sizes all
different colors some have texture on
them some are just solid some are bright
gold summer brassy gold some have like
little swirls in them this is where I
get it Claire's I'm telling you they're
like anywhere between three and eight
dollars a piece they even sell like
those freaking Beyonce hoops like hold
on look at these hoops are these not
awesome honestly like the bigger the
hoop the bigger the ho these are firm
clears right here and these were $8.50
for the big ol earrings which not many
people can pull off but for those of you
who do pull these off and that respect
for you and that was that I have never
thought that hoop earrings like went out
of style but so many people are always
trying me like I love that you still
wear hoop sound like do I miss the memo
that hoops aren't cute anymore because I
have no joke than wearing hoop earrings
since I was 13 years old like there's my
favorite so Claire's is where I get them
they're just the best they're better no
one's at forever 21 the ones at forever
21 rust too quickly and then there's
ones they're the more expensive ones
those always are too small for me like I
this is like my perfect size hoop right
here just like right there that is my
perfect that's my perfect to the one
that I'm wearing right now is actually a
little too small for my taste but since
my hair was back I wanted to go to
smaller hoop but telling you Claire's
done my hair color this is one of the
most ash ass and get it together asked
questions as well my hair people are
always asking about the color and the
tone and what it is that I do for it I
actually went to my hairdresser recorded
with him like him doing my hair in the
process came home lost the footage like
top of the footage was not there I was
so angry so he's like it's okay will
someone get next time you come so I'm
still playing and doing a hair
where I will show you guys exactly what
he does and then I'll come home and I'll
show you my shampoos and conditioners
and everything that I use for my red
hair if you're going to a hairdresser I
would just tell them that you want a
dark rich warm auburn dark warm rich
Auburn that's what like I always said up
until like he got to know what it is
that I really wanted dark warm rich
Auburn is what I asked for
we now makes three colors together we
always mix a dark brown a bright red
like fire engine red and a copper those
are always the three shades that we mix
and sometimes we'll go we'll mix a
lighter brown sometimes I'll mix a
darker Brown right now I have a darker
Brown in so you can see that it has like
a deeper richness to it but when I have
a lighter brown mixed in with the right
of the copper and that's when my hair is
a lighter shade but right now I'm kind
of feeling this darker shade I think I'm
gonna go even a little bit darker but
yet I'm like I want to know why like I
swear to God I can't keep up with myself
for all of you who are always asking how
my hair doesn't fade it's because I
don't wash it okay that's disgusting
I wash it but I don't wash it that often
I only wash my hair twice a week and I'm
telling you it is you know when I do
wash my hair it still doesn't look
greasy like I just have dry hair and
I'll use dry shampoo for extra volume
and all that every couple of days so I
wash my hair twice a week and because of
that my hair doesn't fade as fast as it
should but let me say when I do shower
it is a couple of baths like sometimes
I'll be showering and I'll forget and
I'll beg everyone then and I'll look
down a bit cuz I'll think that I am
bleeding to death because it's like a
zombie apocalypse up in that shower but
I will be making a video all about my
hair very soon so just stick around for
that so I posted you snapchats while I
was in New York on Friday and I was
wearing a super dark brown smokey eye
and I've had so many people ask what is
it I was wearing it if I could please do
a tutorial I feel like it's not
necessary to do a tutorial because I've
done look so similar to that before so
all I was wearing was Mac's saddle in my
crease and then I was wearing Mac and
bark which is a dark matte brown all
over my lid and then I was wearing
makeup geek corrupt which is a matte
black all over the lower part of my lid
so it was like black dark brown light
brown it was just a gradient from black
to brown your I'm saying so super simple
if you guys really really want to see a
tutorial I mean like I can do it that's
what I'm here
but I just don't really see the point
you know I'm saying it was pretty easy
peasy so that's what I was wearing on
snapchat
speaking of snapchat I am like snapchat
obsessed right now like you guys pushed
me and pushed me and push me and now I'm
finally like yeah it's like 24/7 on
snapchat like I swear I love this thing
and I think the reason I love it is
because I feel like no one's actually
watching like I feel like I can just be
myself and do what I want and say what I
want to say I'm just like I had it just
like goes out into cyberspace so I think
that's why I love it so much and then
I'll like go and look how big oh my god
I mean thousand people watch that like
it's scary but that's why I love it like
I feel like I can just be myself and
have fun and so many people have been
asking me what my snapchat is and it's
just Jacqueline our Hill just my middle
initial middle initial are is in between
Jacqueline Hill and that's my snapchat
but only come watch my snaps if you're
