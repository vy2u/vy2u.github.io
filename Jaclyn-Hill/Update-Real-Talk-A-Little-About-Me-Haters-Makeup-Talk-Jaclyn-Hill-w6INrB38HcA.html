sorry hey guys okay so I'm sexting me
can I get a minute filming usually
people know when I don't respond then
clearly filming my best friend is
literally so dramatic
I'll get done filming and I haven't
responded to her texts like three hours
and she'll be like okay ten more minutes
I'm calling the police I'm like a girl
calm down so today I'm going to be doing
a video that is a little different for
my channel I've never done anything like
this before it's going to be kind of
like an update get to know me what's
going on whatever you want to call it
this is not like a question and answer
video even though I did ask you guys on
Twitter and Instagram if you just have
like any questions for me around the
subject so I will just be answering a
few little things along the way
basically I wanted to make this video
because I personally am very big on
communication and all my relationships
in my life my family my friendships I'm
very big on communication I believe that
like having an open communication
constantly flowing like you can work
through anything and that's just like I
really I really live by that I just feel
like here on YouTube you guys are a very
big part of my life bigger than you even
know I wanted to sit down and just make
this video for myself and for you guys
just to communicate with you guys about
what's been going on because I realized
that a lot of times I'm on camera and
I'm doing makeup and I'm talking about
her miles an hour and I'm super silly
and goofy and I don't actually take the
time to sit down and communicate with
you guys can tell you like what's going
on and why is this happening why that's
happening and things are coming up in
the future and stuff like that so I
basically just want to take the time to
sit down and make a video and just talk
to you guys about what's going on like
person that person human being to human
being if you know I'm saying um what
really led me to make this video is if
you guys follow my channel my social
media accounts I'm sure you are aware
that I uploaded a video it was a vlog
for my California trip I uploaded it
last week and I did delete it 24 hours
later after I upload it and I have never
ever and my time here on YouTube had so
many comments and questions about any
particular subject that I
about this California vlog I non-stop
all day is all I'm seeing or questions
on this vlog so I really wanted to take
the time to address it to you guys more
than just I got half assed tweet I
really wanted to sit down and talk to
you about what went on on my side my
point of view and why took it down and
all that jazz um and so basically what
happened is I filmed my last video
before this that was up that was like my
my chairs like turning to the side next
thing you know were to be like not to do
that I put up was like that sparkly look
I can't remember my own tutorial his
envious mermaid it was a makeup tutorial
I uploaded and then I got sick after
that and so after that I was sick for
three days I got like a 72 hour cold and
I went to California and I got to count
which California the day that I started
feeling better and I was not able to
film a tutorial and I was very
frustrating so I don't I feel much at
Oriel the Friday before I left but it
just couldn't work because I got sick
and yes for those of you who are like
are you sick all the time I kind of am I
have a very weak immune system I take my
vitamin I take my minerals I just I get
sick if someone's sick around me I get
sick I hate it it sucks um if you have
any tips for that let me know because
that's just like Who I am and I hate it
um but anyway so I went to California
tweeted you guys and so I let you guys
know I wasn't able to get a video up due
to my sickness and so many people were
asking for a vlog that's exactly what I
did to my little camera along with me
I've logged the first few days of myself
in California with my mom and my sister
and some friends we were there with and
business associates as well so I blogged
about the first three or four days maybe
and then how did this whole ordeal
uploading it it was a process because
the Wi-Fi wasn't working so we had to
drive to Starbucks and drama drama
so anyways got the vlog up and cut up
for about 24 hours then all of a sudden
it got ugly and it got ugly fast and
once one of the comment came all the
sudden was just like and I woke up the
next morning after I had been up for
about 24 hours open up my computer look
at the comments and I was just blown
away by the hate and just the anger and
the pissy Ness that was coming from
people I was blown away
I was shocked it was so I just caught me
off guard and I'm not going to go into
detail about what everything said but
I'm just letting you know that is the
reason that I took down that video my
sister we were sharing the bed my sister
was next to me that looking over my
shoulder and she was just silent she was
just looking like not saying a word
because I know that she's in there
thinking like I'm saying thing like do
you Jacqueline but I was just sitting
there like in shock and shock it was
just it was awful and like of course
like you know you people always get hate
comments here on YouTube social media
whatever it may be once you get a
certain amount of followers I guess is
just comes with the territory which I
can't stand that because it's like why
can't people be nice but you know what
happens but this was different this was
like another level of hate and there was
just so much anger happening and just so
much negativity and it's one thing for
people to comment like this makeup look
your brows are too strong your brows are
too thick as good as it's fine
but this video people were going after
who I was people were going after my
heart making false accusations just
calling me just horrible names things
that I hate things that I would never
want to be portrayed as things I just
never am and just hurtful things and you
know I know they say like six and stones
may break my bones but words will never
hurt me I'm sorry that's like
I'm sorry pardon my french looks like
fun someone's classier I'm sorry but it
is it sucks
anyone who's going to sit there and big
hair is gonna hey and just like Africa
doesn't get to them that's true most
part most the time but there's moments
where it's just too much in that video
pushing you overboard it just hurt me it
sucked and the fact that people were
going after my family making false
accusations and being mean towards them
I just couldn't deal with it and that's
what I'm just like I'm done I'm deleting
it my sister was at YouTube we do nails
like I'm deleting it I've never deleted
video before but it is gone it is not
coming back and to those of you who have
been so sweet and so wonderful to me you
guys have no idea because this really
did affect me and it sucks but it did
and for those of you who have told me
how you loved the vlog and you know you
could tell that I was just excited and
hyper or whatever like you guys are
great I have been reading so many
comment to me recently the past few days
and I really love sorry that I'm
swerving
much back and forth got that swerve
action but I really do just love you
guys so much those of you who have been
so sweet and kind encouraging like I
love you guys honestly like you're going
to keep me going and so I just going to
sit down open up with that because so
many people been asking about it and so
many people have been like what do they
specifically say and I don't want to go
into detail there were so many mean
things said but more than anything
recently that I want to touch base on is
I've noticed a lot of people making
comments um sorry if I'm talking so fast
my mind is literally in 45 different
places from hell but lately so many
people been making comments saying like
I changed or the fame has gone to my
head or whatever it may be in for those
of you who have watched me from
beginning of those of you who feel like
you know me or for my friends and family
who are watching us right now who do
know me that has to make you laugh
because I just have to like I have to
yeah ok I was going to I was gonna be
real with you for a second I'm getting
it really real I went through a horrible
horrible time in my life before I landed
here on YouTube and when I first hired
something videos I was 21 years old I
was a baby I still ended avium 24 I have
a lot to learn I don't know anything
about life yet um I was in a very dark
place when I start building YouTube and
so I have changed in the last two and a
half years here on camera and it's been
for the better because I have finally
come to a happier place in my life a
better place in my life I'm not going to
cry so yeah I have gone through changes
but they've only been good changes and
they've been changes that I'm very proud
of the changes that I've needed to make
because I went I went through some
sights keys before I got to this place
that I am right now and some bad stuff
and I'm not going to go too deep in that
but we all have problems you know every
single one of us and I remember my mom
used to have this frame in our house
when I was growing up and it said you
know everyone you meet is fighting some
sort of battle you know and it's the
truth like be nice to everybody who's
everybody you meet is fighting something
and so that's the one thing I tell
myself about these people are leaving
nasty comments that tell myself like
they're going through a hard time too
they oh she's in their life - that's the
thing
it keeps me strong and keeps me able to
come back and keep doing this but now
that I'm here on YouTube and I'm able to
share my passion with you guys and
you're so accepting
so accepting of what I love to do it's
the happiest I've ever been so you are
going to see me go through changes
especially starting at 21 touching on
like I've let the fame go to my head I
don't I can't even begin to tell you how
much I don't understand that because I
am NOT famous I do not think of myself
as famous and the least that I make
youtube videos anybody can make youtube
videos it does not make me the Queen
Latifah of all people that's what think
of anybody can do what I do just turn on
the camera and start doing it I feel
like so so so so so so many people are
so nervous I'm gonna change I'm gonna
turn into a sellout and I am just
telling you like you don't to worry
about that I'm not going to change I'm
not going to turn into a sellout I have
a very close family that keeps me very
grounded and if I ever were to get cocky
or sassy or think like or become
entitled to anything I have a good mama
a good sister and a good big brother who
would literally just slap me around and
put me in my place and lock me in a room
and take away everything I have and be
like hi I guess now because that's my
family I'm never going to change or get
coffee or whatever it may be so so many
of you guys recently have been really
like into sponsorships asking me if I'm
a sponsor and I'm doing sponsor videos
or just making accusations this is a
sponsor video whatever maybe just wanted
to quickly go over this with you guys as
you know I am never ever ever going to
talk about a product that I do not 110
percent love on-camera I could not sleep
at night if I did
I am only speaking for myself and that's
all I can speak for um if I ever do a
sponsor video it's going to be listed in
my description box below my description
bar always has everything you can think
of every product I mentioned sometimes I
put like what I'm wearing like as far as
jewelry makeup outfit everything is
always down there discount codes coupon
codes whatever it may be links to stuff
that I'm loving just anything these pile
random stuff in that description bar
down below every single video and if I
ever do sponsor video I will have that
listed down
for you guys because I am always honest
with you and I'm not going to sell out
honestly I have no reason to do that to
myself or to you guys like I started
this because I'm a makeup artist who
loves to do makeup and I was not sitting
on camera applying makeup I would be
doing some sort of workshop or I would
be I would be doing some sort of
something teaching people how to do
makeup working with the public doing
what I'm doing on camera but not on
camera that makes sense this is what I
love to do and I'm not in this for the
money and I'm not in this for the fame
or whatever it may be I'm in this
because I love this when I started doing
videos on YouTube I didn't know that it
could become a career I didn't know that
it could become connections and and I
didn't know that you can make a life out
of it at all I had no clue that might
sound stupid but I didn't like I said
like I was not in a good place in life
and I was very disconnected from like
the world and social media and stuff and
I honestly started YouTube because all
of my clients were asking for me to do
videos and at a time I only knew like
two people on YouTube that did it and I
just thought they did it for fun I have
no idea so what I found out like oh yeah
this person no this person and it's all
connected and it's all at this whole
entire like beauty world and you know
you can make money from this and it was
just like that leads me to my next topic
so many of you are always asking if
YouTube is my job and yes this is my job
it's part of it I do many things and
YouTube is one main thing that I do um
anybody can be on YouTube anybody can do
this if you have a camera if you film
yourself if you upload original content
that you own the rights to on YouTube
you are then eligible to start making
money and start getting checks from
YouTube that's how it works anybody can
do it you can upload a video of your cat
and you can get a check for it so
YouTube pays people on YouTube because
they are making money from the views and
then they give you like a small
percentage of it as a check anybody can
do that that's how all of us make money
here on YouTube that's how all of us are
able to continue to make these videos
that's why I don't think like unbend is
because it's like anybody can turn on
their camera when I turn on my camera it
was
five dollar camera from Hong Kong so
it's like if I can do it you can do it
trust me my California vlog I did
mention and drop a few hints that I'm
working on some stuff right now and a
lot of you guys wanted to know about it
and so many of you were just like making
guesses and what it is no I am not
pregnant
so many people think that I'm pregnant
I'm not pregnant well in the sense I am
because I am going to have some babies
but they're not human babies their
makeup babies oh um yes I am working on
some stuff right now you are going to
find out one thing that is happening in
my next video something that I have
created which is super super exciting
and there's a hint for you on Instagram
picture of me and my sister and our lip
color it'll be coming out soon um other
than that I cannot give away anything
that's happening but oh so I know it's
so many of you want answers I can't give
them to you yet so on Solly uh try think
about anything else atomic oh oh is this
super super random I know like what is
this video right it's like it went from
me like addressing hairs now talking
about makeup but everything my life
always goes back to makeup welcome to
the life of Jacqueline Hill this right
here I just have to show you guys
because like I don't know what else I
will oh my gosh can you talk about
deliciousness so this is literally a
lipstick stand that just holds nothing
but lip sticks and can you see the bling
on all the edges it's like these pretty
little rhinestones it's literally a
tower of lipstick I am so oh hey sorry
look at how pretty that is like honestly
it's literally a tower of the fix-it
some Zara Beauty it was a little
expensive I bought it before I'm in
California and it was delivered while I
was gone I'll link it down below I'll
find all I need it for you just like I
didn't know how I found out about I saw
on Instagram I think and I'm just so
excited about it I'm like this is every
girl's dream a lipstick tower like it's
so awesome it holds so many lipsticks so
I know it's super random but I want to
talk about
I love it and I also wanted to talk
about hold on I was in my lighting okay
20 brighter
make it work I went to morphe brushes
when I was in California one day we
stopped on the way back from a meeting
in Burbank and we went to morphe brushes
and I did not realize that they shadows
hmm I thought they only had brushes and
so when I went to sell their eyeshadows
it got all weird and when i swatched
them i was like what is life they are so
freakin awesome so this is a palette I
got so many of them um let me just say I
would compare these two Mac eyeshadows I
have not tried all of them I am wearing
almost all more VI shadows on my eyes
right now with coarse a little makeup
geek uhm as to say so far I would
compare these two Mac eyeshadows are you
ready to the price are you ready
two dollars people ten dollars apiece
you can get a good entire palette like
20 bucks like what like I blown away
when I was in there watching these I was
like oh my god what's going on people
like that
I'm just shocked it I hope you guys are
are you feeling like do get it like two
dollars hello I literally met the owner
of the store she came out towards the
end when I was shopping and we were
talking to each other and I was like um
hi yeah how do you sell these for true
dollars like honestly how does this work
business-wise how is even physically
possible with solid eyeshadow it's good
quality for two dollars and she's just
like so sweet and she's like cooler is
kind of like an accessory Frost I was
like well I'll take them all accessorize
me so so random I know but oh my gosh
like I'm wearing this one on my eye
right now look at the pigment all right
like this right here is really similar
to Mac cranberry look at the pigment
like hello yes like they're just so
gorgeous I love them like I said I only
use what I have on today
which are like four maybe five and six
or bye-bye shadows but so far like I'm
the love I'm a love two dollars apiece
so that is morphe brushes I honestly
just couldn't contain myself I didn't
want to wait to talk about it because
today I was just like like oh I don't
help it I'm so excited by makeup I can't
deal with it so I think that's really
all I have to talk about in this video I
think I pretty much covered everything
so I know this was super super random I
just really wanted to take the time to
get personal with you guys let you know
why I just on my blog let you know that
no I'm not going to change I'm not going
to get pretentious like anything that
you may see on camera just remember
that's only what you see on camera that
is a very small piece to my life and a
very small piece to my personality
what's going on around me and just
remember that we all have problems we
all have issues we all go through tough
times
including me we all have hearts we all
have a soft spot and so yeah I suppose
it down and talk to you guys like a
friend one on one it just been so long
since I've actually uploaded a video
it's been two weeks and that is so
disappointing to me I hate that but I
have cleared my schedule I'm home I'm
unpacked and I'm ready to go so I will
be back with a makeup tutorial in two
days tops three days depending how long
it takes me to get together and edit and
all that I'm going to wash my hands I
