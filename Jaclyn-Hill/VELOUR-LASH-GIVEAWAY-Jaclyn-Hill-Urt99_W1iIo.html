know this is totally random I'm sitting
on my couch I am sweating buckets and
it's like about to be dark outside but I
really wanted to film this for you guys
to get up as soon as possible I'm sorry
I had taken the past week off it has
been craziness anyways so today I'm
going to just jump to the point I'm
doing a velour and lash giveaway the
lure is actually the one who's hosting
this giveaway so a big THANK YOU to them
seriously they have watched my videos
they see how much I love the lure I am
obsessed
I said I'm obsessed with everything but
I truly am obsessed with the lure
they're the best fake eyelashes I've
ever used in my life so five of you are
gonna get the chance to win a pair of
these of your choice so I'll just tell
you a little bit about velour they are
100% mink fur there is no animal cruelty
involved in this process of making the
eyelashes I will put the link to their
website below if you want to read about
how exactly they do that they can be
worn up to 25 times and that is no joke
I know that sounds crazy but they truly
can't be worn for 25 times I've done it
myself
do not put mascara on the velour lashes
the mink lashes put your mascara on let
it dry and then put the mean flashes on
after the mascara is set you can't go
over it with eyeliner to you know make
the band look a little bit more natural
even though you don't really need to
with these because the ban of these
lashes are a jet black so it's not like
it's that clear awkward color where you
can see it and you have to cover it up
these right here are my personal
favourites they're called strike a pose
if you are a winner and you don't know
which one to grab and asked for or if
you want to buy a pair and you don't
know which ones I would say strike a
pose they're gonna be beautiful on
everybody they are so wispy so full and
luscious they are just beautiful so
beautiful
anyways so yeah I am so excited about
this because the ones who win this
giveaway you guys are never gonna want
to buy any other lashes again you're
gonna be obsessed with these and for
those of you that don't win I have a
coupon code for you
it is Jacqueline 2013 and that is all
caps so my name J ACL why n 2013 and
that will give you 15%
of your entire order I know that myself
and my family and my friends will
definitely be taking advantage of that
discount code once again I really
recommend this strike a pose if you're
not like a lash expert and you don't
know exactly which ones to pick because
it can be overwhelming especially doing
it online so that's my favorite all of
the rules for the giveaway are gonna be
down below if you're interested in
entering and not just using the coupon
code please click the little description
bar thing to whatever open expand it and
look at all the rules the only actual
rule for me is to please be a subscriber

hill and other than that it's all hosted
by avalor so you can go to their
Facebook and that's where you're gonna
enter they're going to post this video

that a one more thing I know you guys
are gonna ask because you are always
asking about my clothes and my videos
and I feel really bad because then I
comment and I one sees it so I'll tell
you right now this shirt is a bleeding
Chanel shirt it's from Haute demand or
hot demand and it's got a big side
opening and then my shorts right here
are from thank you your for your
highness for the highness I can't
remember for the Highness I'm not a fan
of high-waisted shorts but I love these
because they actually cover me up like
I'm not into high-waisted shorts where
your butt cheeks are hanging out and
flopping all over the place that's just
not my style so I absolutely love these
because they have like a dip in the
front in the back where I'm covered so
love love love these I am so happy that
I found them as summer is coming into
play because I will be wearing these
babies all the time so I am done I am
talking your ear off I love you guys and
I will see you very soon in my next
