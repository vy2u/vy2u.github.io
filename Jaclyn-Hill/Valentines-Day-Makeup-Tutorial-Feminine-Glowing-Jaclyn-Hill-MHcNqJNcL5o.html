a makeup tutorial for a Valentine's Day
hey I am super excited to be doing this
makeup tutorial because this is very
different for me and my channel like you
know I'm always looking for an excuse to
do like on bang and smokey eye or
something super dramatic but that's just
my style if we all have our thing and
that's definitely a my vibe but today I
wanted to do something a little bit more
subtle very feminine but very glam ultra
girly so I am super excited about this
look I did not think I was going to love
it as much as I do I feel like I want to
live in this look right now I am crazy
about it so I have had this in mind for
quite some time ever since this Tarte
lip palette came out by Tarte cosmetics
I ordered it on Sephora as soon as it
got to my house I immediately knew that
look I wanted to do but I was like what
are wait so Valentine's Day because I
feel like it's just very appropriate and
idealistic for Valentine's Day
such a girly feminine holiday and of
course you guys can you know do a smokey
eye and a bangin red lip or like hot
pink like very sexy but I want to do
something a little bit more of a
laid-back kind of casual sexy let me
just say sometimes I get a little
uncomfortable using the word sexy on
camera moving on I hope that you guys
enjoy this look it is craziness for me
because I left my lower lashline blank
and you know I always smoke out my lower
lashline and I always put mascara on my
lower lashes so not doing that stuff I
felt kind of naked at first but I'm
definitely getting used to it
but I did that because I wanted to give
the eyes a squinty a more girly effect
which I think just it's just so pretty
this look would look good on so many
people you've dork course objected to
your own needs your own face you can
take steps away you can add steps you do
you so I hope you enjoy let me know what
your plans are for Valentine's Day down
below if you have any in the comment
section I would love to know what you
guys are up to John and I we have
decided just to hang out by ourselves at
home we're going to cook dinner together
and we'll probably end up eating a box
of chocolates past
on the couch watching a movie because
that's just how we do things around here
we're always looking for an excuse just
to sit around and do nothing and just
hang out because we're both definitely
homebodies we don't go out and do like
events a lot we just like spending time
alone so that is what we will be doing
so let me know what you guys are doing
for Valentine's Day and I hope you enjoy
this video I love you and I'll see you
soon bye guys so I'm going to be using
the tartlet palette to create today's a
look and the first shade I'm going to be
using is supermom if this really nice
matte vanilla color and I'm going to be
taking a fluffy brush and putting it all
over my entire lid my eyes have already
been primed but I'm going to pack this
color on all the way from lid up to brow
because we're going to be using all
matte shadows today this will help
everything blend out and not stick to
our base then I'm going to go in with
force of nature this is a really great
beige transition shade I am using an M
502 brush from morphe and I am taking
this and predominantly putting it in the
upper crease area going up towards the
brow then I'm going to go in with the
shade force of nature and put that right
over top basically we're going to start
off light and we're going to go one
shade darker darker and darker to create
a really nice three-dimensional kind of
soft cut crease so I am going back in
with the same brush as before I'm just
packing that right over top and
windshield wiper motions then I will go
in with a shade best friend which is a
really pretty cool tone kind of Mavi
purple shade and now I exchanged out the
M 5:02 for the m5o 3 by morphe I am
loving these new brushes that they came
out with I think they're amazing so as
you can see I'm putting that a little
bit tighter and denser in that crease
I'm not going as intensely above the
crease with this but I will continue to
go back and blend everything out because
I don't want anything harsh I want this
to be nice and soft then I'm gonna go in
with bombshell which is a very dark true
cool tone purple color and using any
angled brush I'm going to just really
put that tightly only in the outer
corner of my eye just to really carve
out that crease you can use any angle
brush you want and pretty sure this is a
brow brush but you do you and then of
course I will go back and blend it out
because I don't want this look to be too
harsh then I'm gonna go in with my
favorite color from this palette which
is the shade Caregiver I love this as an
all matte palette overall but I love the
shade specifically because it's such a
pretty very ultra pigmented matte kind
of babydoll pink shade I think it's so
feminine and so flattering so
I'm using a 55 brush from Sigma which is
ideal to pack a color like this on all
over the lid I am taking this all the
way to the outer corner and then I will
go in with a pencil brush and I barely
have any products on this just a little
bit of the shape best friend I'm going
to slightly carve out that crease one
more time then I'm going to do my
eyeliner I am using a Maybelline
blackest black gel liner and I'm going
to carve out a winged liner and then
fill that in you do not have to do a
wing this is what I'm comfortable with
you could do no liner you could just do
a little thin liner but I chose to do a
wing because that's just me I'm going to
go back in with the shade supermom and
just put this on the brow bone I didn't
want to do a shimmery brow bone
highlight because we have an all matte
eye I kind of wanted to stick with that
matte look and just do a natural
highlight I'm gonna be using a blinking
Butte lashes which are my new love Oz
and this is in the number six
I love these lashes look at look just
look just look so feminine so pretty
just dainty and beautiful I thought it
was perfect for this look so I will list
those down below and then I'm going to
prep my face using these using the
Smashbox primer or water drench myself
because I can never get enough and then
I'm going to take a little bit of mac
fix+ and i'm going to spray my brush i
am using the sigma f80 flat top kabuki
because it's one of my faves and then I
am using the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation in shade one two three the
reason I spray some fix+ on my brush is
because it kind of helps to share out
the foundation and moisturize my skin as
I'm applying it so it makes it so that I
don't get cake face because I can
definitely be heavy-handed with my
foundation so if you wet your brush
first even if you wet it with just a
little bit of water I don't make it so
that your face does not get overboard
cakey and you can keep your foundation
more on the sheer side same with the
Beauty Blender that I'm using right now
I'm using Mac Pro Longwear concealer and
I am just tapping out with a damp Beauty
Blender and using a damp Beauty Blender
will do the same thing and make your
concealer not too heavy then I'm going
to go in with the Chanel bronzer and I
am using a sigma f80 six I believe to
apply this I did not want to contour my
cheeks
I just wanted to bronze my cheeks
because again I didn't want this look to
be too over-the-top or too intense so I
am just going in with a cream bronzer
putting this kind of all over the cheek
area all over the temple area and I will
leave the under eye area at the chin the
nose and the center of the forehead
untouched
everything else I'm just dabbing with
bronzer just to give a really nice kind
of healthy sunkissed glow as opposed to
like a structured contour you know what
I'm saying it's just a little bit more
feminine then I was going to set my
under eyes because they will crease if I
do not set them so I have to set my
under eye no matter what I'm going to be
filling in my brows using the Anastasia
brow Wiz in the shade taupe and I'm
filling in my brows differently today
than normal which I'm think I'm gonna
start doing it like this from now on I'm
only filling in the lower part of my
brow and I'm not touching the top of
them and they look much more natural
this way then I'm going to be going in
with the hourglass ambient lighting
powder in the shade a luminous light and
I'm going to put this bad boy all over
those cheekbones this is my favorite
highlighter if you are looking for a
highlight that's going to look natural
there's no glitter it honestly just
looks like you are glowing from within I
recommend it to all brides I think it's
beautiful there is a palette with three
different shades I highly recommend that
it is just gorgeous especially if you're
trying to go for a look like this then
I'm going in with makeup geek blush in
the shade head-over-heels this is kind
of a shimmery icy babydoll pink and I'm
going to put that all over the cheek
area just to give a really nice feminine
and pale cheek I'm going to take a
little bit of natural beauty shadow and
on a pencil brush just put out tiniest
tiniest amount underneath my eye area
because I just felt like I looked too
blank and too squinty I just wanted a
little bit of a shadow you'll see it
really didn't make that big of a
difference though and then I'm going to
go into my inner corners with supermom
again and then you could even take some
highlighter and put it in there but I
want to make my eyes look a little bit
brighter then I'm going to finish off
this look using colour-pop lippie stick
in the shade bound which is one of my
favorites favorite colors right now it's
such a pretty baby doll pink and I'm
going to set everything with Urban Decay
chill makeup setting spray and then I
took a look at myself and I was like oh
wait a second I want a little bit more
pink on these lips so I used OCC Digital
acai believe it's called it because this
is a super babydoll pink which I love
and I tap that on the center of the lid
and just blend it out and once I did
that my look was done so I hope that you
guys enjoy happy Valentine's Day to you
I love you guys so much and I'll see you
soon
oh I need to chill myself let me just
say the word chill has a whole new
meeting once you get into the urban
decay chill makeup setting spray because
sometimes like you need to chill and
like grind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
