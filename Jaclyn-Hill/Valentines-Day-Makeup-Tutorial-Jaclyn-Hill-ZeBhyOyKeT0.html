hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
a Valentine's Day makeup tutorial I
chose this specific look for three main
reasons because it is romantic it is so
easy to accomplish and it's a little
good on everybody and I wanted to do
something really universal here on my
channel for Valentine's Day
that way all different ages all
different skin types all different
colors you can all rock this look and
all feel pretty and this is one of the
few looks that is truly a little bit on
everybody I have done this look on many
people in the past and it never fails
it's such an easy romantic soft go to
look so of course you can modify this
for yourself to whatever you feel is
appropriate for your Valentine's Day or
whatever you can wear this whenever you
want not just Valentine's Day but I love
it it's a really pretty date night
makeup look my husband loves this makeup
look even though there's a lot of
products being put into it and it's
still glamorous it's very soft and
wearable so I hope you guys enjoy I love
you so much and I'll see you soon bye
I'm going to just pull my hair back so
that it's not hanging in my face this
whole time and it is a struggle because
I am wearing extensions by Bellamy today
so I've got a lot of hair I'm going to
prime my eyes using Mac Pro Longwear
concealer it's important when doing a
look like this to prime your eyes with
something that has a concealing power
that way you don't see all the veins in
your eyelids since we're not using that
many eyeshadows I'm going to start off
by using mac cosmetics grain eyeshadow
this is such a beautiful beige color
that really works on everybody and it is
not too shimmery and it has no glitter
it is a beautiful color for more mature
women who are looking for a glow but
don't want to wear shimmer I'm using an
E 55 brush and make sure you get in that
inner corner for an additional highlight
then I'm going to use Mac bamboo we are
doing all matte shadows today baby and
then using an e 40 brush which is just a
big fat fluffy brush we're going to
blend this out mainly focusing on the
outer corner but bring that to the inner
corner as well you can use a light
bronzer for this if you want all we're
going to do is just kind of sculpt out
that I area these shadows aren't going
to be super noticeable but it's just
going to bring more definition to the
eye and end result then using a sigma
eyeliner pencil this is in eclipse which
is black I didn't have an eye eye pencil
sharpener anywhere and so I
grabbed this and I'm so impressed by how
nice this eyeliner was it's great so I'm
just going to get this deep down in
those lashes as you can see not perfect
that part doesn't matter that's what
makes this look so simple and then
grabbing any gray that you have this is
typographic by Mac I would definitely
use a grey over a black because when
blending a black can be a little too
harsh and messy so using any pencil
brush this one is by Sigma it's the e30
just start blending back and forth you
can make this as intense as you want I'm
choosing to keep it a little bit toned
down and then using any sort of eyebrow
brush eye pencil brush whatever you want
eyeliner brush just give it a slight
little wing as a cat eye and then blend
blend blend blend blend as you can see I
get a little messy on the outer corner
but that's okay keep blending you can
use tape if you want to kind of cut off
that edge to make it sharper I chose to
do it this way I also apologize for the
focusing and angle in this video I am
working with a brand new tripod camera
and lighting so give me a couple videos
I'm getting the hang of it but we're
going to get there baby
and then I'm going to clean that up
using any eye makeup remover towelette
and that is how we're going to sharpen
out that line so that's why I don't have
to worry about being precise I'm telling
you this is the easiest makeup tutorial
and then we are going to go in with any
mascara I'm using L'Oreal and then
Eschete Oh false lashes these lashes are
what I actually inspired me to do this
look for you guys because they just felt
perfect for this eye makeup it just
completed it so I absolutely love these
lashes then using Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer this is the luminizing
one so it's going to give you like this
nice bronzy golden like effect all over
the face as you can see I'm going to go
on top of that with NARS sheer glow
foundation as always what do you think
I'm using my Sigma flat top kabuki brush
to apply this you guys know by now this
is my Holy Grail brush no one will
separate me from it as you can see this
foundation does not match my face but I
assure you it is dead on with my neck
and I want to match my neck so that in
the end it all blends together then I'm
using Mac Pro
we're concealer I could barely get that
out of my mouth in shade nw20 and I'm
using the f-86 kabuki brush to blend
this all out by Sigma this is the most
amazing brush of all time to blend out
your concealer it picks up the excess
and it makes sure that you don't have
cakey concealer it's it's just perfect
whatever you have left over on your
brush
I always just dab it on the forehead and
the chin to balance it then we're going
to go in with anastasia dipbrow pomade
okay here's the deal with this stuff I
love it it is amazing it is so smooth
it's so creamy it cuts my time in half
I'm filling in my brows but let me say
there is no color that is working right
for me so my brows are looking in tense
in this video much more sculpted than I
would personally prefer as you can see
they're like BAM so I might be going
back to the brow Wiz but I love this
stuff so much but I need a different
shade because it's just not working so I
am using the Sigma brow highlighting
pencil and then just blending it out
with a definer brush I've been really
really liking this recently there's many
different brands that have this sort of
brow highlighting brush and then just at
the very high point of that brow at that
arch I'm going to dab shroom by Mac only
at the high point and then to even out I
will put a little bit of shroom in my
inner corner as well just to match that
shroom on my brow it just ties
everything together then going in with
the Anastasia contour kit I'm going to
highlight my face using this yellow
shade right here in the center if you
are darker in tone I would recommend
this one by Mac Pro which is soft focus
I just thought that I would show you the
other one cuz this could be too late for
anybody who is about three shades darker
than me so I am just going to use a
sigma tapered highlighter brush just to
set this underneath of my eye area and
that truck upside down triangle motion
on the chin Cupid's bow down the center
of the face and forehead just lightly
dusting this just to set all those
liquids and creams and keep that
highlight and then I'm going to go in
and contour with this shade on the
bottom left of the palette it was my
left you are right whatever and then I'm
going to contour the NARS eita brush let
me just say when I was looking at this
footage I was shocked by how intense my
contour looked on camera it did not look
like this in person it is so like bam in
your face on camera so
another little thing I'm gonna have to
work out but anyways we're going to
contour and if you want to see how I
contour in depth I will put my contour
video down below and I'm going to go in
with Mac Melba this is one of my old
school favorites and I'm just using a
Mac 129 brush to put that on the apples
of my cheeks and work it backward and
just mix it into that contour and
bronzer and then I am using Mac whisper
of guilt highlight I try not to use this
on camera because it's very hard to find
if I can find it anywhere online I will
list it below for you guys it's just a
beautiful gold color and I'm going to
tap it on the areas of the face where we
want to specifically highlight then I'm
going to use bamboo again underneath of
that eye and just blend it back and
forth just a little bit so that we don't
leave that under-eye area completely
bare just a little something will bring
more definition to the eyes then I'm
using L'Oreal voluminous carbon black
again just to put some mascara on those
lower lashes again just to bring more
attention to the eyes I never like to
leave my under eye area completely blank
it makes my eyes look very small then
using the shade native by Urban Decay I
am going to coat the lips in this
lipstick which is the perfect perfect
pink and then go over with maybelline
petal pusher which I talked about in my
favourites video absolutely love this
gloss and you are completely done so I
hope you enjoy it I love you guys so
much and happy Valentine's Day
