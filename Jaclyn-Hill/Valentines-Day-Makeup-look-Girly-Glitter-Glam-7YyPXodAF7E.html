Valentine's Day a makeup tutorial for
you I asked about a week ago about a
week ago if you would prefer to see a
soft feminine makeup look for
Valentine's Day or something more
dramatic and glittery for Valentine's
Day and in most everybody said they want
to see something soft and feminine but
incorporating glitter and I was like oh
like the way you think so I immediately
start thinking about look I wanted to
create for you when I actually filmed
this video for you on Sunday and I hated
it like I loved the look but when I put
my footage into my computer I was like
this is awful oh not good like I didn't
know what the issue was that I actually
found out today that the issue was my
camera settings my camera settings were
so out of whack because I was helping my
sister shoot for her blog on Saturday
and I didn't even think about the fact
that the camera settings were completely
changed so the ISO was too high I was
shooting on the wrong mode it was just a
mess sorry so anyways I sat down today
and I really like perfected the settings
in my camera so hopefully today's video
is more on point than it's ever been
fingers crossed I'm actually glad I
refilled it though because I actually
like this look better like now the
second time that I did it's the first
time I was kinda like we're just gonna
wing it
um but yeah I like this better now so
I'm glad that I refilled it for you guys
so much more happy with this so anyways
for today's look I use a lot of baby
Pink's I really wanted to emphasize like
the eyes in the sense I wanted to keep
them nice and soft as far as the shadow
went but I did add the glitter and then
the lashes to make it look really flirty
and girly and then the cheeks are very
highlighted and baby pink just to really
emphasize like the natural beauty and
bring out like those kind of spring
pastels I am so ready for spring makeup
looks you guys you don't even know I am
done with the dark I'm done like I am so
ready for spring trends I'm so excited
to be doing like fun pops of color and
springy looks I can't wait I'm so I'm so
excited I feel like I usually am not
that excited for spring because I am a
fall and winter girl I love my dark
colors but this year I'm like I can't
wait anyways I am babbling keep in mind
that this look is not just specific to
Valentine's Day you can wear this any
day
you want I personally feel like this is
gonna be one of my new go-to looks for
days where I just want a little extra
something something but I want to still
keep my face looking kind of more
neutral and natural if you will so yeah
and you don't have a Valentine this
Valentine's Day don't feel bad you can
be my Valentine I feel like I never had
a Valentine really before John which is
not okay because I dated the same guy
for three consecutive years but I feel
like we were just always like
conveniently on a rainy like whatever
Valentine's Day would roll around and
I'm pretty sure they're just a cop-out
for him to not have to buy me chocolate
or jewelry oh the things I wish I could
say to my 16 year old self I'm gonna
stop babbling now for real I hope you
enjoy this video if you do make sure to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe and
that's it I love you guys and enjoy mm
bye good morning everybody for today's
look I'm going to be starting with my
face duh or else we're gonna start our
butts anyways so I'm going to be priming
my skin using the cover FX illuminating
primer and then for foundation I'm going
to be using the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD foundation stick as you can see my
body my hands my neck everything is much
darker than my face because I did
recently get a spray tan and I did not
spray my face because I just didn't want
to dry it out so I am using shade one
two three even though technically my
face is probably like a negative 13
right now and I am using the artiste
oval 8 brush just to blend this out as
you can see I'm drawing the stick
foundation onto the skin and then I'm
going to go and pretty much circular
motions lightly over the face to blend
this out that's my favorite way to use
this brush for application and then I'm
going to go in with concealer I'm going
to be using the Urban Decay Naked
weightless skin concealer it is my fave
right now this is my all-time favorite
concealer just so everyone knows like I
have other ones that I love but this
takes the cake for me it's number one it
really is weightless it's hydrating it
doesn't crease it doesn't settle it's
sheer I love it and then I'm going to go
in with a very damp Beauty Blender and
I'm going to just begin to tap that out
because I put on so much concealer my
Beauty Blender I made it really really
nice and damp that way it didn't get
cakey because the extra dampness will
really help to absorb that
so now I'm going to go in with a lighter
shade and this is the aegyo and with
like the light medium and this one is
the light shade and I'm going to take
this and just draw a design in the
center of my forehead one line down the
bridge of my nose as you can see the
chin the Cupid's bow and I'm going to
make lines right there on my jowls if
you will and then I'm going to just
again with the damp Beauty Blender go in
and just blend this out this is just
going to be a way to kind of naturally
highlight the face if you want to bring
highlight and depth to the face it's a
really good time to do it when you're
working with your cream products because
it can tend to look the most natural now
I'm going to go in with the RCN a no
color powder I showed this in my most
recent haul and I'm going to grab a
brush and just begin to dab this on my
under eye area as you can see doing a
light application nothing crazy I'm not
going to bake under my eyes or anything
I just want to set the under eye area
you do have to like shake it out and get
it to the cap that's my only complaint
with this is that the packaging isn't
amazing but you get a ton of product and
the product itself is amazing I'm going
to moisturize my lips really quickly
because I do not want them to get dry
since I'm going to be using a liquid lip
today and then I'm going to go in with
the Kat Von D shade light eye palette
and I'm going to grab this peachy shade
over here all the way on the right hand
side and I'm going to use a blending
brush and just put that in the outer
corner of the crease I am using the
morphe m4 33 brush but any blending
brush that you have and you're
comfortable with will do I'm doing a
light application and I'm going to
remain on the outer corner I don't want
to cover my entire lid I don't want to
bring it to the inner corner I just want
to keep this kind of nice and light and
natural and airy on the outer corner of
the eye put the main intensity right by
the lower lash line and then begin to
blend upward toward the brow as you can
see I'm staying in the crease right now
and then I'm going to go a little bit
higher as I don't have any product on my
brush now I'm going to grab my Natasha
de Nonna palette which I absolutely love
and I'm going to grab the shade 6 4v
shale it's kind of a kind of a tongue
twister I'll put it down below for you
guys um I was trying to find a shade
comparable to this one but this is
honestly just so beautiful and so unique
it's a gorgeous dusty rose shade and
with that same m-43 3 I'm just going to
put that right over top of that peach
color just for more
dimension and bring a little bit more
depth and those pinky tones without
looking like we have pink eye and I'm
not trying to be funny I contend to look
like I have pinkeye if I use the wrong
shades of pink that's why I love this
shade because it's like the perfect
perfect dusty color now I'm filling in
my brows and I'm using the new Anastasia
brow definer and as you can see it is
the easiest thing in the world like
legit this is it that's how quick it is
to fill in your brows it's ridiculous
I'm going to go back in with the Kat Von
D shade light eye palette and the mac
242 brush i'm going to pack this white
color on the inner corner of my eye at
first it might look a little spooky
you're like holy moly this is white but
you will blend it out and then it'll
look much better especially once we
continue the look this really light
white inner corner will just make
everything look really feminine and
girly and it'll really make your eyes
stand out in a quote natural way I'm
doing the quotations with my fingers can
you see it can you envision it okay now
I'm going to highlight the brow bone
using mary lou manizer by as a balm
oldie but a goodie highlight I used to
be die hard for this highlight and it's
still a good one so I'm going to use
that just to put it right on the top of
the brow bone just to bring a nice
highlight that's a little subtle not too
intense I'm going to go back with that
same etosha Dena shadow and I'm going to
put it only on the outer half of the
outer corner of my lower lash line oh
that was a tongue twister but using any
pencil brush just go ahead and slap it
on there and then once you don't have as
much product on the brush kind of wrap
it around bring it down blend it out
make sure it is not too harsh so it's
nice and blended and light now we're
going to go in with Mac reflex pearl and
I'm also going to use some of the lit
cosmetics glitter glue I dip my brush in
the glitter glue I dip my brush in the
glitter itself and then I just begin to
pack it on the lid when I'm working with
glitter I do not swipe I pass so as you
can see I'm just going you like that
noise up and down and just packing the
glitter on if you swipe your brush like
you with a shadow probably the glitter
is going to fall down all over your
cheeks or it's not going to apply the
same this is the best way to apply a
glitter to get the maximum payoff and
not have a ton of fallout for lashes I'm
going to be using the Lily lashes
ghalichi glam in n yc4 I'm going to just
coat
eyelashes with some mascara because this
will make the lashes look much more
natural just a little tip to go ahead
and mascara the lashes first and then
I'm going to pop these babies on and
make sure they are very nice and close
and tights the lash line that way they
look the most natural even though these
lashes clearly aren't natural you know
what I mean you don't want any gaps
especially since we didn't use any
eyeliner so you want to be nice and
tight to your natural lashes that's also
our mascara helps then I'm going to go
in with the mac mineralize skinfinish
powder in the shade medium and I'm going
to just lightly dust this on the cheek
so I'm going to put this kind of on the
outer corner of the face that way like
the bronzer the contour the blush all
that jazz goes on a little bit more
smooth and then I am going to be using
Mac's shade sorta contour I really
wanted to use the new makeup geek
powders but I brought them to my house
and I left them here and since I am at
my beauty space right now I'm I couldn't
use them yet but I'll use them in the
next video so I'm going to lightly
sculpt out my cheeks as you can see
blending up I'm going to make sure that
I really get the entire edge of my
entire hairline that's what's really
important to me I think whenever I'm
bronzing the face is to make sure you
get all around the hairline and then
sculpt down on the cheekbones then I'm
going to just sculpt everything out
going back in with the same RCM a no
color powder and I'm going to let that
harsh intense line just sit there while
I apply blush I'm using the urban decay
and Gwen Stefani blush palette look how
Purdy I'm going to go in with the shade
cherry which is a really light kind of
lavender baby pink and I'm going to just
lightly dust that on the cheeks right
over that contour up towards the temple
these are super duper pigmented I am
loving these blushes and then I'm going
to just go in and blend out that harsh
line and as you will see it's going to
reveal like a really intense contour
line if you don't like it that intense
blend it out a little bit but if you
like it to be like that girl you good to
go then I'm going to apply mascara on
the lower lashes which as you can see
I'm super talented at doing that on
camera and then I'm going to grab the
hourglass ambient lighting palette the
morphe M 501 brush and I'm going to just
lightly sweep this all over the
cheekbones kind of down the apples of
the cheeks everywhere basically because
it's so natural and subtle and then I
will go and with mary-lou manizer by the
balm and I'm going to use the morphe fan
brush that I raved about in my favorites
the
three 100 and I'm going to highlight
specifically on the tops of the
cheekbones I like using that ambient
lighting powder underneath though
because it gives a nice glow but then
this is like POW right on top you know
what I'm saying that's the noise I
envisioned when I highlight just so you
know now for lips I'm going to go in
with Kylie cosmetics candy Kay lip liner
these lip liners are super creamy as you
can see how I'm applying them on camera
they just really glide on very easily if
you are someone who likes a more dry lip
liner kind of like the Mac lip pencils
you won't like this one if you like a
creamy lip pencil this is going to be
your best friend it's a really really
really nice formula so I'm going to line
my entire lips and I'm also going to
fill my entire lips in that way my lips
are completely covered in the creamy lip
liner then I'm going in with cocoa k
liquid lipstick again by Kylie my
initial impression I will say is that
these apply really beautifully but most
of them overall dry very flaky and tend
to just kind of flake off on your lips
Coco K on the other hand did not give me
any issues whatsoever it lasted for over
three hours beautifully it was
comfortable at the same time I did
exfoliate my lips this morning in the
shower I also moisturize while I was
doing my makeup and I use a creamy lip
liner so that may be one of the reasons
why Coco K worked so well for me but I
personally think that those steps are
necessary in order to make these liquid
lips comfortable so yeah that completes
this video you guys I hope you enjoy
