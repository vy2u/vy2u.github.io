going to be doing a Valentine's Day and
makeup tutorial for you hi I was like
I'm going to do something like so
intense like pink and purple and sparkly
gasps no no with Jacqueline get-together
and all reality probably honestly 85 to
90% of women on Valentine's Day aren't
going to realistically want to do like
hot pink and purple in glitter like
they're going to be something more
flattering and feminine and soft but
still kind of sultry and sexy you know
I'm saying so this is a look that I came
up with I really wanted to focus on like
the inner glow of the skin and not so
much like a blinding highlight like a
Mack truck coming at you like in the
dead of night on Interstate but more
just like an all-over
glow from within so I definitely took
the steps to do that today if you are
oily and if it is your nightmare to be
all over glue like glowy's or dewy then
just skip skip right past that part of
it as far as the eye I wanted to keep it
smoky but soft and subtle there's no
black incorporated no black eyeliner no
black eyeshadow so it is very very
simple and of course a bold red lip just
to give it that little pursuit from some
I really hope that you guys enjoy this
top is falling off of me like I need to
do it together I'm not going to lie I'm
wearing sweat pants right now you want
to see you want to see the truth of life
yeah
um I really am thirsty today hello
everybody I'm so happy to meet them it's
Super Bowl Sunday and you already know I
don't give up it I took a poll on
Twitter a couple days ago asking us if
you prefer voice over or talk through
makeup tutorials and talk through one by
a ton I think it wanted like 70
something percent so yeah I would be
doing a costume makeup tutorial today
for Valentine's Day for today I'm going
to be using some new products but we've
new to me or things that I uses a long
time maybe I don't know I don't want
this to be the same thing as always so
I'm going to try some different
techniques I'm kind of trying to switch
it up pull up so you'll always do and
let's jump into it okay so I'm gonna
start off by priming my face of course
I'm using the girl on primer whatever
primer you want for your skin and knees
go ahead and slap that bad boy on make
sure your fingers are nice and clean the
rule of thumb don't want to spread any
germs don't want to get any bacteria on
your skin so make sure your hands are
clean before doing or anything on your
faces two fingers I'm also going to take
some makeup forever smoothing primer as
well and put that in the center of my
face because I definitely am battling
some texture right now so I'm going to
take a pretty generous amount of that
and I'm going to put it right in this
area around my nose I'm going to be
using the hourglass vanish stick
foundation it's my hair foundation ever
but I actually wanted to use something
different for today's look but I can't
because I don't have my shade in any
other foundation currently then these
vanish one so last night on Sephora and
order like a bunch my favorite
foundations in my shade because recently
I have been just embracing my like
natural fair skin so everything else is
like a deeper golden shade from my spray
tan so I'm going to be sticking with
this today I'm going to be using shade
ivory and shade bisque and just drawing
stripes on my face I know it looks like
I'm applying a lot of foundation as soon
as I am applying a lot of foundation but
the thing I love about this hourglass a
nice foundation is I honestly feel like
you can put so much on and it never gets
caked you doesn't do
uppercuts slimy I don't know it's weird
but that's why it's my favorite I'm
going to be adding into cover FX custom
enhancer drops they come in several
different shades I am using the shade
celestial because it is the lightest one
and what I'm going to do is just with
the dropper I'm going to put this on the
back of my hand and if using a much
smaller brush to normal I'm going to be
using a small synthetic guy like this
I learned this tips from Nicole known as
lipstick Nick she did my makeup when I
was out in LA for a photo shoot and she
was using his tiny little brush and
Oliver you using and she's like it's the
morphe e8 I love using a 2/5 foundation
I was like interesting and I love the
way my foundation looks so now I've been
using a small synthetic brush and I love
it and this is a more feet why 10 my
third gold collection so I'm going to
just pick up a little bit of that
highlighter on the brush I'm going to
tap off a little bit cuz that's a wee
bit too much I'm going to begin is to
blend this out I'm going to pick up a
little bit more of that highlighter on
the back of my hand on the brush and
then just do the same thing to the other
cheek and if you weren't going to use a
stick Foundation and you wanted to do
this all you would do is just mix it all
together on the back of your hand you
would do like a couple pumps of your
foundation and back to your hand and
then a small drop of the highlighter and
then just mix it together and then apply
it on your face but I'm doing it this
way since I used a stick foundation
alright I'm going to be trying a
different concealer today and this is
the Estee Lauder Double Wear stay and
place flawless wear concealer my friend
Jackie told me that she loves this
months and months and months ago so I
bought it and I just misplaced it and I
found it yesterday and I was like oh
let's give it a try you guys have
absolutely no idea how hard it is for me
to try a new concealer when I am so
dedicated to a like current one like
right now the Tarte shape tape is my
everything so just putting this on my
face and like move over like it I don't
know I'm so crazy about concealer but I
need to start branching out and trying
more things need to get it together I'm
going to just grab a dance beauty sponge
and just blend that out and let's see
how it looks
oh my gosh I just love a damp Beauty
sponge I swear to God I think it's a
tool I will never be able to get up
nothing blends out my
there I like a DMVs much all right now
I'm just going to take some RCM a no
camera translucent powder you already
know it's on the tip of my dance
Beautyblender and yes the Beauty Blender
is still damp make sure that it's not
soaking I mean if your Beauty Blender is
really really damp it's not going to
apply your concealer or your powder
right so make sure there's no excess
water in and if you totally wring it out
and then you'll be able to use any
powder you want and I think the dance
Beauty sponges apply powder so
beautifully now I'm going to take some
cover FX translucent powder and I'm
going to just very lightly like from the
cap just take a little bit and just
super duper lightly put this on my face
I don't want to like any coverage or
anything I just want to make sure that
everything I apply is in a state in
place right now I'm going to fill in my
brows normally I do eyeshadow and then
brows but recently have just been
getting crazy dog and getting crazy up
in here and do my brows first so I'm
going to just comb everything upward
with the sleet and I'm seeking fill in
where I see needed can you imagine if I
left my brows like this you guys to love
me okay sorry I'm watching the
foundation off my lips because it was
looking like super crusty and gross
anyways for today's eye look I'm going
to be playing with the new color pop
single eyeshadows which I am soulless by
the playlist because these were sent to
me like the past two weeks I was saying
thank you color pop for sending me these
are so pretty these are just the
neutrals either not like the whole
collection by put the neutral inner
palette of course you know me I was so
excited about the colors and i swatched
them with two nights ago and was like
woah like the pigmentation they seemed
so pigmented and so creamy so I'm really
excited to actually like use them today
give them a go and see how they apply
gonna start off with the lightest matte
Brown and this is in the shade wake-up
call I'm going to apply that to my
crease area with a fluffy brush I'm
going to zoom you in I'm going to place
this right in that outer corner and then
just dust in this whole crease area I'm
not really going too much into the inner
corner I'm staying where out here and
then once I basically have nothing left
on my brush that's all just like so
lightly
to Luba in this area alright now I'm
going to pick up note to self which is a
little bit deeper and more like a
caramel brown or color is so pretty
I'm going to layer that right over top
of what we just did which is packing it
on this lower crease a little bit more
not lower pretty sorry outer corner of
the lid a little bit more to deepen and
that up and swoop it up into the crease
alright now I'm going to pick up this
really dark kind of neutral brown and
this is initiated cloud 9
now I shadow all of them up snails and
on a small definer brush like this guy
right here I'm going to just put that on
the upper lash line I want this to be
the darkest on the outer portion of the
eye and so once I get to the center in
the inner corner I'm going to go really
really lightly because I don't to be add
pigment in that area I basically have
nothing left on my brush right now and
I'm just kind of going over to Seoul
agreeing it and putting a little bit
more on my brush and just slightly going
upward and now we're going to go back
and forth
okay so just a quick note as I'm
applying my eyeshadow I'm noticing that
this new Estee Lauder concealer that I
tried is breaking up on my under-eye
it's not super bad but tart shaped tape
would not be doing that to me
alright and now for the lid I'm going to
go in with some shimmer we can make this
very feminine and dainty and Ali and I'm
going to be yeah I'm going to be using
you know the drill
I'm also going to mix it with let me
explain because I like them both this
one's like a little bit darker or
champagne and this was like a lighter
champagne so I'm going to mix them
together and apply those two lid okay
yes these are pretty nice
if you get a little bit more of that
dark brown and pop it on this lash line
because that shimmery color just covered
a lot of it up which is fine that it
covered some of it up but I just want to
make sure that we have a little
definition in there I'm going to take a
little precision brush like this I have
been obsessed with little brushes
recently just to get nice some time in
the certain areas and I'm going to just
take that dark brown and just emphasize
a little bit and just make sure that
this outer area not picking up high nice
and low it is going to make sure that
it's not really thanks to make sure that
like this really lower outer corners
right here not up in the crease just
super lows just have that depth see on
this eye how it doesn't have like a lot
of depth right there we'll just find if
you want to keep it soft like that but I
just want to get in there and make sure
it's just that outer corner nice and
dark just like a little bit of like a
sexier more smoldering sultry look it's
going back and a little bit more of
those Browns I used before I'm going to
make sure that we have it you know nice
lines so for my lower lash line I'm
going to take that same dark brown shade
I've been using basically the whole time
and I'm going to just lightly put yes on
the outer corner for this moment picking
up those light brown max I'm going to
just blend this out with a fluffy brush
I'm going to apply some mascara now so
that my lashes are nice and black I'm
using the Loreal voluminous carbon black
I'm going to be using my favorite lashes
of course I'm obsessed with them right
now and they are the intoxicating lashes
by soul letter oh my gosh they are drama
mama which is why I love them they just
make any look so just sassy and flirty
on the set but they are dramatic so
don't buy these unless you want the
drama
I am so frustrated at my undereye right
now from this concealer I do not like it
like it is breaking up so that I'm
trying to like add some powder under
there to like stop the breakage and
maybe give some coverage back but it's
like oh no I'm not happy with it all
right kind of put some mascara on my
lower lashes I'm going to be using the
Mac extended play gigablack lash such a
long name for a mascara I'm moving on to
the face I'm going to be contouring
using the Charlotte Tilbury film-star
bronze &amp;amp; Glow a palette it looks like
this I know I used a highlight before I
don't think I've ever actually used this
like bronzing sculpting shape so let's
hold it look free I'm always really
scared to try new contour colors I don't
know it's just like it's just something
that I'm afraid of because like the
whole face is basically done at this
point if you put on a contour color it's
like super muddy or just to red or just
not your color you're right damn it like
I don't know I get really nervous I
think that's why I really like to stick
with my bronzer and contours like I'm
very devoted and I never want to like
step outside the box so it's very hard
for me to try new things this is a
pretty color this is pretty yay
definitely has a little bit of a red
undertone on me which I don't typically
loved you feel that texture right there
let's going on with me for blush I'm
going to be using Becca cosmetics flower
child I want my cheeks definitely to
have like a pink blush a very creamy
fern just taking that same damp Beauty
sponge of the earlier and kind of
carving out what I just applied to keep
it nice and clean I pretty much do this
no matter what unless it's just like day
today and I'm using a huge fluffy
broader brush to apply bronzer kind of
everywhere
I always carve this out just to clean it
up so that it doesn't look messy I'm
going to put in some clear brow gel I'm
letting it that sit let's get these bro
under control I always wait towards the
very end to do my clear brow gel just
because as I'm applying my makeup like
I'll hit my brows I'll move them around
so I plate until the very very end to
apply this so that they're just signed
sealed delivered now I'm going to clean
and that up with a brush you can see it
just makes that area look much more put
together and just not not like a hot
mess I'm going to grab the hourglass
ambient lighting powder and a shade
luminous light one of my favorite
highlighting powders if you want a
really like natural subtle glow I just
love this one so much it's what like all
the women in my family use I'm going to
grab a brush what I'm going to do is
basically just dust this almost
everywhere like on all of my high points
because it's so subtle but it's just
going to give you like honestly a glow
from within it's just going to give you
inner radiance it's not going to be like
very I'm high light it's just going to
give you a really pretty soft feminine
glow
now if you are really oily this would
probably be your worst nightmare but if
you are drive to normal and you don't
have to fight with oil constantly
breaking through your makeup then this
would be the ideal way to really get
that just like inner beam of radiance
that girl like me who are always drives
normal are searching for I'm going to go
back that Charlotte Tilbury highlighting
and contouring palette I'm going to grab
a really light amount of this highlight
because it is already a really really
subtle shade but I'm going to just put a
pinch right there the top of the
cheekbones alright and now for lips I'm
going to be using one of the new morphe
liquid lipsticks in the shade morphe
let's do right you're like more be red
okay use my coat please choose my calls
so now to finish this look I'm going to
go with some makeup forever a mist and
fix setting spray I'm going to spray my
entire face whenever I'm waiting for my
finishing spray to dry I always just
kind of stare straight forward because
if you look up or look down you can make
your eyeliner or mascara smudge all over
your face use your face is wet or try to
look just straight forwards like a full
60 seconds until it's dry all right so
that completes this look of course I had
to change and put on some pretty
earrings but leaving the greasy hair in
the ponytail
okay okay anyway so the one thing I take
away from this video try a couple new
products is the Estee Lauder Double Wear
concealer I did not like and I hate to
say that which is why I don't typically
do first impressions on camera because I
hate hate hate to say negative things
about brands typically if a product
comes out and I try it and I don't talk
about it that means I don't like it if
that makes sense like I tried to take
off camera the on camera
I just wanted getting things a negative
review I know a lot of people like the
honesty and I didn't like this concealer
it went on so beautifully they're in
full coverage and it drive really
quickly and very matte so I had really
high hopes but throughout doing my
makeup
it was just breaking up creasing it's
kind of like fading away was I just
running down my eye area so I am NOT a
fan of that concealer sadly as far as
the color pop eyeshadows I am super
duper impressive these these are really
nice especially for the price like very
creamy very pigmented I have any trouble
blending whatsoever like really really
beautiful I hope that they expand the
line I love me some single eyeshadows I
hope they make it a really huge line
because they're really beautiful the
only thing I don't know a lot about them
there is a lot of kickback meaning like
when you take your brush and you like go
to like dip into a color I let them
focus I just go to like dip into a color
like this like you see how much product
comes up so you constantly have to be
tapping cause you have to be blowing off
the product which is not that big a
video
the price if it's going to be like a $40
eyeshadows and I bothersome but for the
price that I think of a deal but that's
honestly the only negative and then that
I discovered so yeah that's it you guys
I really hope that you enjoyed the talk
through Valentine's Day look I
personally love this book I think it's
super girly and super feminine and it's
pretty easy to do if you guys follow
along
I think it's brazii so can it stop
talking I love you guys thank you so
much for watching and have a wonderful
Valentine's Day even if you don't have a
man even if you're all by yourself I
hope that you have a wonderful day
celebrating you so thank you so much for
