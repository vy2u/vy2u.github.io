calling yourself sexy like no hello I'm
gonna go wash my face now by two slices
of cheese
oh hi everybody
hi everybody so tonight I'm going to be
showing you how to do this really dark
smoky eye I have got a lot of requests
for Valentine's Day sexy makeup and I've
got a lot of requests for really dark
smoky eyes and I've also had a few
people tell me how I do the same look
every single time so I kind of wanted to
just put all those things together and
make this video because I love this look
and I have not worn this look or done
this look on myself and probably at
least a year and a half I think the last
time I wore this look is for my three
year anniversary year anniversary oh my
god it's been a long time
it isn't really really easy to
accomplish you'll probably be shocked by
how actually easy it is I know it's
intimidating because you're going in
with a dark black and a lot of people
are scared of looking at they got
punched in the eye or having raccoon
eyes but when it's done right it is so
beautiful and it looks growing everybody
from very fair to very dark since we are
working with black it looks good on
everybody so this is very universal
that's why I chose this for my
Valentine's Day look I think I might do
on one or two more Valentine's Day looks
hopefully I'm hoping if I can have the
time to get around to doing some more
tutorials that'd be great umm yes
it's really pretty really easy to
accomplish so I really hope that you
enjoy this love you ma bye
so the first thing I'm going to do today
is take Mac prep and prime vibrancy eye
primer and put this all over my lids now
I'm not a big fan in Mac skin care and
prepping prime system there's a few
chosen things though that I think are
amazing and this is one of them I'm
going to use the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation today we're really going to
concentrate on the skin we're going to
switch things up a little bit and do it
kind of backward eyes now and how I
normally do it but I'm going to use the
Beauty Blender and I'm going to Pat this
foundation all over my skin I have been
obsessed with this Beauty Blender
recently I've owned it for a while and I
didn't really care for it but I think
I've really just taught myself how to
use it in a way where I really like it
and I get it really wet under the faucet
and it just sheers out my foundation and
makes it buildable and looks so natural
so I'm using studio Fishkin studio
finish concealer and NC 30 I'm going to
take this and put it in the areas I
think are necessary if you can't tell
here I'm really sick that's why my eye
area is super red I'm really right
around my mouth and my nose I was
extremely dry as well I was really
really sick for like six or seven days
and that's when this was filmed so I'm
gonna blend that in all over with the
Beauty Blender once again I cannot get
enough of this thing and I'm going to
use Mac prep and prime highlighter and
the shade radiant rose this is the pink
shade there's three different colors and
I'm using the pink one for the under eye
area to correct and I'm going to use the
same one but in the shade light boost
which is the yellowish one and I'm going
to put that all over on the face to
highlight I don't want to put the pink
one all over the face because that would
give me too much warmth in my skin and
too much pink and it would make me look
pale you know how some girls when you
see them highlight they look too fair
and it's too much and it kind of like
defeats the purpose um this will stop
that so pink under the eye and then
yellow tones on the rest of the face and
again I'm going to use my handy dandy
Beauty Blender to do all of these things
because it just blends everything out so
easily and perfectly and this thing is
my obsession for my concealer now like I
don't even want to pick up anything else
for the rest of my life to do my
concealer because it makes it so easy
and you're going to see what I'm talking
about here in two seconds I'm using the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer
always obsession this is a 12-hour wear
concealer and I use it as my primer like
every day because it has a technology in
it where it's not going to settle into
any fine lines and wrinkles which also
makes it amazing for more mature skin
and that older generation of ours we
have because this will really not settle
into those fine lines and once again I
recommend doing it with a beauty blender
because it'll keep it nice and thin and
you won't really pack it on and get too
much I'm going to use Mac wedge this is
a great all over color that's not too
warm or too cool this basically looks
good on all skin tones and I'm saying
all skin tones this looks really good on
I'm taking this on a big fluffy brush
and I'm just dusting it all over my lid
as you can see I'm bringing it down in
the outer corner because we're going to
round out that outer corner to the
bottom and we're going to connect the
two and that's why I did my foundation
first today if you are on a lower skill
level of makeup artistry I would suggest
doing your foundation last with this
look um because it by the way I'm going
with the color saddle right now and I'm
keeping it lower in my crease and not
buffing it out as much as I did with
wedge but I just wanted to say that you
probably know into your foundations
second just because with this dark
colors that we're going in the color
will fall down all over your cheeks and
ruin your foundation if you don't know
how to properly use your brushes and
apply these colors it can get really
messy so you might want to do that last
but I just wanted to show you that this
is how I'm doing it when I do this look
I don't do this all the time and there's
many many reasons for that if you want
me to expand but today I'm doing it like
this I just really wanted to concentrate
on the skin first because it's very
important to have you know flawless
looking skin when you're going in with
such an intense eye so I'm using Mac's
Paint Pot and quite natural you can see
mine looks like it's super dried out
along the edges it's like completely
hollowed out it is still completely
usable it's not as creamy as it once was
but a lot of people are like oh my Paint
Pots completely dried out I can't use it
anymore
it's still usable I don't know why I
have not been like taught as to why this
happens to all my Mac Paint Pots but it
does and it is still completely in total
usable so I'm going to go in with a
matte black this is a jet black this is
max carbon but basically every single
line has a color just like this if you
have the naked palettes they both have a
great matte pigmented black and I'm just
going to pack this on all over the lid
I'm using a synthetic brush you're not
going to want to use any white hairbrush
for this because it's going to hold onto
your product and it's not going to make
it as black so you're going to want to
use a hair that's not white on your
brush and that will really get you the
darkest most pigmentation that you can
get from this shade and as you can see
I'm keeping it low I'm not going at high
up above that crease and then I'm going
to use that goat hair to just kind of
slightly blend it out I don't have
anything on that brush at all and I'm
going to continue to bring it up just a
little bit more just step-by-step but
I'm moving very slowly because the last
thing you want to do is bring this black
to high and that's when you will look
like you have been punched now if you
guys think that I already do look like
I've been punched that is a personal
preference but this definitely is the
correct way of doing this smokey eye and
the correct way of blending I was taught
this smokey eye by an artist at Mac our
regional trainer back in 2009 of how to
do this technique and it just makes it
so easy you know just packing that black
on really low and moving up very slowly
and then continue to look at yourself in
the eye and continue to back up and kind
of look at yourself from different
angles and if you're using a magnifying
mirror make sure you look at the regular
mirror just to kind of see what's even
and what's not and you'll see how far to
bring it up on your eye shape and then
remember to kind of relax the eye and
then lift your eyebrows just to see the
difference in your expressions that you
will naturally be making and you can
kind of work with it from there so I'm
taking that same shade saddle that I
used before and I'm just dusting it all
underneath my eye and I do that before I
go in with black which I'm going in with
the same black shadow right now and this
is where I'm rounding it out on the
outer corner I'm connecting the black
from my top lid to my bottom lash line
and I'm going to bring it all the way
into my inner corner I'm not going to
bring it to the point where it meets the
black in my inner corner as well because
if you do that then it will become a
very very dramatic
I don't want it to be that intense so
I'm going to line my inner waterline
with any black kohl pencil and as you
can see I'm like pushing it like pretty
far down all my lashline and I'm not
pulling and tugging at my lashline
either I'm like pushing up at the very
bottom so my waterline kind of just like
flips down you don't want to tug at this
area so delicate and I'm going to take a
Mac to 1/2 brush and I'm just going to
buff this out and I'm going to drag that
smolder pencil along with that black and
as you can see in the outer corner I'm
doing a little bit more in the inner
corner I'm doing a little bit less so as
you can see this is a very easy look I
mean I'm hoping that this looks easy to
guys and isn't overwhelming at all in
any way I'm using Maybelline eye studio
gel liner in blackest black and these
brushes I'm using that have the pink on
them they are by Stu Dona lace
I've been trying them out some of them
I'm like in love with like I really
really love this liner brush it's
awesome but I'm not really saying much
about them I'm still testing them you
know still don't have my opinion formed
yet
I do love my Sigma and Mac brushes Sigma
for life um red cherry
number 43 lashes these are my go-to
lashes I basically use them every single
video they fit my face well they really
they work with my eye shape they work
with my bone structure so red cherry
number 43 eye or them on eBay I don't
know the name of the seller I think it
has the name Joanne in it but I just
type in red cherry lashes on ebay and I
usually buy about 20 to 25 of them at a
time for like 35 bucks so there's that
I'm going to take benefits hoola bronzer
another favorite of mine right now and
this huge Sedona lace fluffy brush I
don't know the number of it but I really
really love this brush I've been using
it a lot because if you know me in all
my videos I really don't care for I'm a
very structured contour all myself I
love it on others um I don't really like
doing it on myself I think it takes too
much time I prefer to concentrate on my
eyes most of the time so I like brushes
like this just to kind of do a slight
like buffed out
toward that I'm not sitting there for
five minutes really sculpting my cheeks
I just want to get in there and move on
so I really like this brush because it's
not too huge and it's not itty bitty
where I have to put in all this effort
I'm going to take max shroom on any
fluffy brush and I'm going to dust that
just pop it right in my inner corner and
you can really bring this on the side of
your nose if you want that will kind of
separate the eyes so you don't look like
you've got two black holes it'll kind of
separate them and bring a lot of lights
then then I'm going to go in with Alpine
bronze which I am addicted to like I
don't even know how to live without this
right now it came out and the limited
appraised chic collection by Mac and I
am I am just so obsessed with this blush
it looks good on everyone every skin
tone every fate it is it's perfect I
just I love it so much so I'm just
slapping that all over my cheeks and
then I'm going to use what is this
called it's by I don't even know mary
mary loumanizer
is that it yeah whatever anyways so yeah
mary lou manizer and i don't know who
this is by I can't believe I forgot the
balm that's who I'm going to take this
and I'm going to kind of dust it all
over my face very lightly as you can see
I'm not going back for additional
product I'm just lightly dusting it over
the high points of my face for a little
glow then I'm going to use Mac's cream
cup lipstick which is a baby pink and
I'm going to top it off with NARS
Turkish Delight lip gloss that Kim
Kardashian made ever so famous for those
nice glossy lips to just do these eyes a
favor and after that you are complete
and I hope that you enjoyed this look I
love you guys so much thank you for
watching have a great night bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
