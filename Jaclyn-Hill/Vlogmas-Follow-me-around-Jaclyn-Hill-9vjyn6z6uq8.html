that sometimes will happen to me when I
get really really stressed I'll like
break out in hives but this isn't highs

pimples and the making and I haven't
tried anything new so I don't know maybe
becoming allergic to my husband George

loving so far I'm obsessed with this one

song

brother's house and we got cupcakes for
the nieces because because John is
keeping the cupcakes very safe by
buckling them in in the seat belt and um

what hey mom hey I'm recording your it's
something called vlogmas let's talk
about it later come look at my skin oh I

filming everything okay
okay oh my god so this is the product
that I use last night to blow up my face
out and what I'm now calling hives it is
a self tanner I got Sephora for like ten
dollars on Black Friday it was gift

it I have them all over my face all over
my forehead I have texture all over up
here and then all over my chin area it's
just it's insane so that problems a
no-go so it is day two of vlogmas it is
the date it is Monday
the night you can see all my unchecked
everything I suck at life so yes woke up
this morning to see that my allergic
reaction is becoming much much much
worse as you can see I'm beginning to
feel like vlogmas is turning into a
progress report on my acne my mom was
like it gets my before it gets better
so we'll see if that's actually true I
don't I don't know and I don't want to
go to a dermatologist because they're
just gonna put me on really strong
creams and ointments and drive me on an
antibiotic and I don't like that stuff I
I'm not going to wear makeup all day
because I think that this needs to
breathe and I have to run a lot of
errands I have to go to the mall I have
to go to a doctor appointment I have to
go to a chiropractor appointment I have
to go to Petsmart and I'm not going to
wear makeup so let me meet any of you
guys today you know hello
seriously now you know that like when
I'm on camera telling you how much I
love products
it's no joke it's seriously my life like
I love products it's Christmas movie
night I ordered a bunch of my favorite
Christmas movies I have not seen in a
while I mean not all these are new but
like four of them are the Grinch I don't
know what you guys but this was
seriously my jam growing up like
Thanksgiving night I would watch this
every single day until Christmas I saw
it in theaters I'm not joking I think
six times when I was like 13 oh my god
no I was around 13 obsessed obsessed
obsessed alphas actually the only movie
that I have never really got into it
only seen it once but every Christmas
everybody is like oh my god so I figured
I had to order online and then the
absolute classic of all time Miracle on
34th Street this is John Hughes made
this film if you guys have not seen
Miracle on 34th Street you really are
missing out it is the sweetest little
Christmas movie I love it so so much
it's so charming and this literally it
just always makes me feel like Christmas
is here it's just it's a great movie and
honestly for this one just don't judge
me so I am seriously dying from this
right now somebody tweeted me is that I
feel like Jacqueline Hill needs one of
these so she stops getting hurt slash
sick and I'm literally laughed so hard I
was almost in tears when I first saw
this because it's literally my life like
I need to be put in a plastic bubble
what is up with my luck
