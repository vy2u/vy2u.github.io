and I got glam
um and then I haven't even seen him in
hours he went into my office and shut
the door and I left him alone and I have
been dealing with emails and fun stuff
like that and phone calls and then I
decided today that I wanted to announce
my collaboration with Becca and so um I
kind of normally there's no way to like
be like yeah yeah I'm so excited I'm
gonna wear it getting probably not is so
surreal I'm so excited anytime my
friends are always like oh my gosh this
is so amazing I'm like stop talking
about it it makes me feel weird I'm
uncomfortable but I'm so excited but
yeah so because of that there's been a
lot going on like with Becca at the
office and a lot of phone calls and
emails and stuff like that so I'm so
freaking excited I can't even believe it
but we are going to go see the new snow
white movie mm-hm um we've to leave in
actually 30 minutes and I can't wait to
see it it looks so good I never even saw
the first one I I saw the first one but

love Kristen Stewart as an actress the
only movies I love that she's in is a
Twilight movies other than that I don't
but I love Emily Blunt and she's in this
love Emily Blunt so I'm really really
really excited to do this I just can't
wait either
we're gonna bring food I feel like I
should start a show I didn't call it car
ride confessionals wait no that's
already a show isn't it well I have my
red light rants and you best not be
stealing those I feel like it's perfect
it's just so easy to learn in the car
all right confessions I should start
doing a separate show a separate Channel
Jacqueline heel car a confessional
reversal and I could have other
youtubers on it wait this is bum like
and I could like interview them like
James Corden is that his name oh I could
get like Manny and Patrick and Jeff of
course nearing all the queens and PK oh
my god that'd be so much fun wait
actually be amazing though are you
kidding me right confessional then we
can think is get in my car I'll pick him
up dry them around and just like talk
for 45 minutes talk I love that and
then in every single one we would stop
at Starbucks that we could hear like
their order Oh everyone loves to know
what you ordered our vote good idea and

favor talking like a combine I'm dying
for this idea
Karen crushes I die I want I like I want
to do this thank you he's super cute oh
my gosh you're in a relationship knock
it off I did look people think I'm so
weird because I truly do not look at
other guys like John is the only person
I look at and I compared everyone to him
I'm like yeah Chris Hemsworth is like
super hot but doesn't have John's eyes
okay that's super freakin cute but also
super no I'm dead serious right

really don't John will say the other
girls are pretty and I don't care and of
the day I always compare everyone to
John so does him John is gorgeous John
is freakin gorgeous
I don't think the world actually knows
how hot he really is look is so badly so
many tattoos and like his hair so grungy
and he's so grungy I don't think you can
actually see his face but his face is
like Wagle I don't want to change into

my camera though so I couldn't vlog as
much as I wanted because like we were
standing in the Beehive Bay hives I was
the big hive and so I like come on bumpy
and it fell and broke my camera broke so
I had a second one at home so I came
home put my memory card in and so that's
why I couldn't film more at the concert
and I have to say just for anyone who
wants to sit in the beyhive that's my
first time ever seen beyonce first time
in the hive and i have to say i wasn't
in love with it at all
i might have just been raymond james
stadium I've heard other great reviews
about the beyhive The Beehive
at other stadiums and arenas but
honestly I didn't love it there were
moments where she got so close that it
was like oh my god like very surreal
because she was literally like three
feet away at one point it was like right
there my face and yes Beyonce does have
pores and they're perfect she's so thin
in person like she's such all-around
body goals but I didn't realize how tiny
she was a person like she is so freakin
ridiculously gorgeous she has the most
mesmerizing smile oh my god it was just
an amazing performance it was absolutely
incredible it's such a fun time uh I got
to meet so many of you guys which was
amazing and any of you were calling my
name and I didn't turn around it's
because I didn't hear you when we got
into the car Jackie was like Jacqueline
there were a few people that were
screaming your name and I had absolutely
no idea but like Jackie was walking
behind me and said that she could hear
people and so I'm really sorry if you
yelled my name and I didn't turn around
I swear to God I would never do that
intentionally ever ever ever if I hear
your name I'm gonna turn around I'm
gonna talk to you um was really funny
though saying that this guys we're
leaving he was like I was like oh my god
he's gonna grab all of us and I took a
picture with him he was so sweet and he
was like you're my biggest fan we were
dying like instead of saying I'm your
biggest fan he said you're my biggest
fan I was like hell yeah that was so
much fun anyways okay so we stopped on
the way home and got Taco Bell
I'm so hungry can we eat this is that
we're come up at Taco Bell in like four
years
yeah can't wait I know I said okay I
don't talk about four years I haven't
