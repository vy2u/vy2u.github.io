an intro today because I'm on my way to
work
I'm moisturizing my lips for our dark
lip later and then I am going to take
soft brown as always I know it's getting
repetitive but it's necessary especially
for the fall and winter so I'm taking
this color I am putting it all in my
crease with a big fluffy brush a fluffy
brush is absolutely mandatory for this
look you need one if you don't want to
buy a Mac one you can get from from
Sigma I bet you can get this exact same
one from Sigma for like ten dollars and
it's necessary and it will change your
life
so with that soft brown I'm going from
inner corner to outer corner up to my
brow in by my eye socket everywhere I
want this to be very very blown out and
smoky I'm going to take texture this is
a warmish Brown it's kind of like a
caramel color and it's got a little bit
of sparkle in it but it's not like it
looks matte like see how it looks matte
yes it looks matte but yet still has
shimmer in it so I'm going to take this
on a flat shader brush I'm going to put
it all over the lid and I'm going to
dust in my crease like you see me doing
but then you'll notice that I'm going to
kind of turn my brush to the side and
it's going to help shade that area even
more see how I'm turning it to the side
now because that's going to bring it up
a little bit in my crease so you just
want to keep packing that on so that
that color that's basically matte keeps
getting more pigment IG's I don't it to
be washed out I'm going back in with
soft Brown a second time I'm going to
take this and I'm going to go in between
the shade texture and the soft Brown and
I'm going to kind of manipulate those
two together I'm keeping my brush word
out aside with like a sidewards
angle but I'm also going to go back to
like straightforward with it and I'm
just going to really smush my brush in
there and move it around to really get
that blended out we do not want this
precise we do not want to keep this load
on our lid we want this to be blown out
especially once we go in with the liner
and lashes it you're going to be very
happy that it's blown out and once again
I go back with that first brush with no
additional product and just help move it
all around so I want it to be blown out
so then I'm going to take Swiss
chocolate
favorite eyeshadow by Mac of all time
I'm going to take this on a fluffy brush
with no precision at all and just
basically focus on the
my eye doing this extra step will just
help give you more dimension so that
it's not flat and it really helps to pop
it's just going to give you a little bit
more warmth and depth and I'm not doing
anything to precisely like I said now
I'm taking uninterrupted this is the
color of vomit to be honest but for some
reason I'm really attracted to these
shades I see them and I'm like that's
disgusting I have to try it now it's a
pro longwear eye shadow so it's
extremely smooth and it doesn't require
a primer in order to put it on I'm
taking on a 222 brush and it's a very is
this much smaller precise blending brush
and I'm taking that and I'm blending it
up above everything else just smoothing
it out the reason I'm using this is
because it's got a lot of yellow tones
in it and I really like that
um this is not necessary at all see how
blown out that is when I look in the
camera because when I'm looking down you
can't really tell that much but when I
look up but you can really see how blown
out this is again I am just fluffing a
brush over my eyes I'm just picking up
products and fluffing it out you know
cuz I do not want any lines in this so
yeah I did my eyeliner if you want to
see how I did that I'll put a link below
for my eyeliner video you can see how I
do it but that's my eyeliner got a
little wing it's not super thick not
super thin I'm going to pop on my lashes
these are red cherry number 43 I use
these eyelashes basically for every
single look I do unless I'm doing
something specifically where I want a
different type of lash but I do order
these lashes specifically in bulk I'm
going to use this voluminous false fiber
lashes mascara
it's drugstore mascara I don't need
anything special especially for this
part where I'm just going to be dabbing
it on my real lashes underneath my fake
ones I'm just dabbing as you can see
avoiding the fake lashes I'm just trying
to blend the real and the fake together
okay yeah you can see me in there
touching up my eyeliner just to make it
blacker I'm not very good at staying in
the camera okay I'm taking natural
radiance Mac prep and prime primer it's
awesome I'm putting all of my face it's
the only primer that I believe in really
and after that I'm going to take max
line filler and I'm going to put that in
between my eyebrows I know this seems
like a lot but that's because it is but
seriously I get these horrible lines in
between my eyebrows when I use really
cream
foundations which is what I'm using
today I'm taking fix+
and I'm using this to set my entire face
with hydration because I am very dry and
the cooler gets outside the dryer I get
taking mineralized foundation with Max
Studio sculpt SPF 15 they are both in a
shade NC 30 in case you're curious and I
am using the Sigma I think this is the F
80 stippling brush to put this all over
my face please don't leave me comments
about how my foundation is too yellow
because I am aware that the camera makes
it look yellow
but it does not look like this in person
it's the exact same color as my neck my
arms and my body so no hate haters then
I'm going to take dazzle light eyeshadow
and I'm gonna use this to just pop a
little bit of highlight underneath my
brow bone I'm using dazzle light because
it's got some yellow base in it and it's
going to blend well with the yellowy
tone I put on last Pro Longwear umm
concealers where I showed Anna
Maybelline concealer I mix those two
together
I'm loving this Maybelline concealer
right now so much I have mine in the
shade fair it's the second to lightest
one and I'm blending that all underneath
my eyes and then up towards my cheekbone
and I go back with my foundation brush
just to help blend that together so that
I don't have like a distinct white
concealer and then I'm taking
mineralized skinfinish in the shade dark
I'm using this as my bronzer / contour
taking a big stippling duo fiber brush
and I'm going to just drag that
underneath my cheekbones along the side
of my face top of the forehead the whole
deal I really have been loving this
brush again for bronzing and contouring
I forgot how much I loved it and I'm
really glad that I've gone back to it
because it really makes it look
airbrushed it gives it like this
flawless perfect effect so yes I'm all
about this brush right now I can't get
enough after that I'm going to take Max
Coppertone blush looks like this I have
it in the little pan for my blush
palette eyes popped out so you can see
it's a matte blush you can do mat or you
can do shimmer I just liked how I had
Matt eyes and I want to do a matte blush
as well with a little bit of highlight
that way you know I'm kind of all matte
today it was I was just feeling it with
a creamy emollient dewy foundation I
just like the look so then I'm going to
take
max extra dimension highlighter that
came out with the Holiday Collection and
whisper of Gil if you have this go you
it's freaking awesome I'm going to tap
it on the top of my cheekbones just to
give some highlight you can see I don't
know if you can't really see actually
but it looks really it's a beautiful
highlight it looks like a cream but it's
not I'm taking max care blend powder in
light I think this is shade light or
maybe light plus light and you'll see
what a difference this makes here if you
pay attention how I gotta have my mouth
hanging open and order to do this for
some reason I don't know why it doesn't
work if I don't have my mouth hanging
open but I'm going to go down kind of on
top of my blush a little bit and it'll
really help blend in my blush to my skin
can you see the difference between my
eyes because I can that's a big
difference so yeah I just I bring that
powder down and it just really really
helps bring in the blush and the powder
and the foundation the concealer it just
makes it look very natural if I skip
this step throughout the day my face
will kind of start to look a little like
creepy but if I do this my skin will
look like this all day long so then I go
back with that same brush before with no
additional product on it just to smooth
out the blush and if any white powder
fell down on top of it I just want to
kind of get rid of that so that's why
I'm doing that with that brush then I'm
going to take soft brown and texture and
I'm just going to go back and forth
packing this on my eye and I don't
really look at myself when I do this
because I can just feel it and for this
look especially you don't have to be
precise you just want to get it on under
there and blend it out buff it out all
over the bottom lash line and then I'm
going to take Mac's Swiss chocolate the
same one that I use in the crease
upstairs on the eye and I'm going to get
that as tight as my lash to my lash line
as possible and just run it back and
forth I'm taking it all the way into the
inner corner I know a lot of people are
like should I just do this in the outer
portion should I bring it in all the way
I never know I bring this bad boy in all
the way I want that under eye to make a
statement and then I take just a clear
clean brush preferably white hair and
just blend it out so that there's no
lines under the eye taking any mascara
you have and just doing the bottom
lashes I really like doing this for this
look because it really opens up the eyes
and that's what I want this look to be
about I wanted
to be a nice blown-out Brown smokey eye
but yet still look fresh and wide-eyed
and have a big pop of color on the lips
and not too shimmery not too matte you
feel me so I went in with Mac's lip
primer which I really have become
obsessed with because it's necessary for
these dark lips night moth's lip liner
is what I'm using as you can see it's
super dark it's super gorgeous um
but yeah you guys if you have issues
with your your lip liner moving or your
lipstick moving i really suggest the Mac
lip primer I was never a big believer in
it but I am now it's it's awesome it
will keep your lipstick in place for a
very long time without bleeding or
moving around so then after I have my
lips lined I'm using Revlon's black
cherry lipstick Thank You Heidi cupcake
for the reference love you I'm gonna
pack this on I'm gonna be totally honest
with you guys right now I only did this
part for the video I took it off
immediately after and I went to work and
then I reapplied it I was running pretty
late at this point rushing that's why my
lipstick is not looking so hot I was
just trying to get it over with so that
I could show you guys and then wipe it
off and jump in the car and go to work
and reapply it so bear with me I am
taking this NARS eyeliner I don't know
the name of it I'm going to have it
listed down below but it is amazing
because it's this cream color and it
helps open up your eyes and give you
this fresh like glowing white eye look
with any shadow and it really
complements this dark lip and these
smokey eyes and highlighted skin so yes
this is the finished look and I hope you
guys enjoy and have a wonderful fall in
winter bye girls and guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
