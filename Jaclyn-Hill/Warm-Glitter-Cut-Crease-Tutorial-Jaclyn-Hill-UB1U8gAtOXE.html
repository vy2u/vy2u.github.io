videos I need to admit that my copy is
on totally a bad word like the front of
it so basic with no joke like the time
is right here like it's on backwards
it's from Topshop the front is a basic
view no big this looks so much cuter
like why would I wear this in the back
of me we're new and consuming for
today's video I am going to be doing a
makeup tutorial on this list to see a
rest here and I'm so excited because I
am using the coloured raine Queen of
Hearts palette yay I had so many
requests to use this palette I mentioned
it in my best of beauty for 2016 it
looks like a zit and I also mentioned
that like I wanted to do a tutorial but
I really didn't know how to do a
tutorial without making it okay the same
warm smoky eye that I always do so I did
this look today that I am obsessed when
I saw this picture wake up and makeup
posted it if you guys know that account
it's a great account for makeup and they
posted this artist her name is Kay Rin B
I was super inspired by this I do know
actually like replicate it like recreate
the look but just in general I was
really inspired by this I just went in
it like added some glitter and did like
my own shape and technique alright guys
i'm gonna stop rambling i wanted to be a
five-minute intro and all my other
videos i'm trying to get better at that
i hope you enjoy the super casual makeup
tutorial very ideal for brunch team with
grandma early morning church service
maybe meeting the boyfriend's parents
very subtle so I hope you enjoy thank
you so much for watching and I love you
guys
look I was coming to the sky boom I
think hey guys we're going to just jump
right into it today so first thing I am
doing of course it's priming my eyes
this is an absolute must
whatever primer works for you will do I
personally use concealer and a damp
Beauty sponge and then I just go over it
just really lightly dusting a
translucent powder that way the
eyeshadow goes on nice and smooth and
it's not sticky or tacky whatsoever and
it's much easier to blend the shadow so
I'm going to be going in with the Queen
of Hearts palette and I'm going to start
off just kind of medium tone warmish
brown shade and I'm going to be going in
with this brush I don't think I've ever
actually used before it's much more
longer and denser and almost like a
little bit more stiff but I use it for
this look because it was honestly
perfect for creating a cut crease as you
can see I'm getting it like nice and
tight in that crease area and the
bristles aren't moving so I'm going to
make that just as pigmented
all the way in the inner corner as I am
all about the outer corner going back
and forth in when
why promotions then we're going to pick
up this hot orange shade I'm going to go
right over top of that in this moment
I'm not trying to be SuperDuper precise
like if this shadow gets down my lid
that's fine this isn't where we're going
to create the cut crease we're going to
do that later but at this moment just
make it easier on yourself later and you
don't have to do as much work just try
to keep it in your upper crease area and
not be too sloppy with it on your lid
because it'll just make everything
easier on when you do go to cut out the
crease so as you can see I'm going back
and forth over this many times just make
sure that we don't have any harshness
whatsoever now I'm going to pick up this
gorgeous like purpley magenta oh my gosh
I love this color and I'm going to put
that on a much tinier brush much more
precise and just fit that right in the
crease I'm going to keep this a little
bit lower because the other two colors
like the warm brown and orange I kind of
blend it out a little bit higher I'm
going to keep this one nice and low
really tight and dense just in that
crease because I want this to kind of be
an ombre effect from like purple to
orange so now I'm going to mix both that
Mac magenta shade and not shimmery
purple and on a fluffier blending brush
I'm going to begin just to pack this in
the whole outer corner of my eye going
up and touching the shades that we
already applied in the crease and then
bringing it downward I really want this
outer corner to be the darkest part of
the eye look and also like very very
purple at one point you're going to see
me put like that cranberry shade over
top of it and I ended up going back and
recovering it with a purple but I just
thought it looked the best the most
flattering with the darkest purple right
here in the crease I know I don't put
shimmers in this area but I love it like
I really really really loved the way
this look you can see even with a
blending like natural hair brush the
pigment on these shimmers are no joke
I'm going to pick up that cranberry
shade right here I'm going to put it
right in that crease but then I brought
it down a little bit on the outer corner
and I actually ended up not liking that
so I'm going to go back and cover that
up with the dark purple later but I do
want that cranberry color to be in my
actual crease if that makes sense just
not on the outer corner so now I'm just
picking up any concealer that you have
and any synthetic brushes you have and
this is the mac 242 brush it's nice and
flat so it works perfect for this I'm
literally just going to carve out and
cut that crease and as you can see it is
so simple if you try this out for
yourself like it is the easiest thing
ever and you can go over it with shadow
and boom there's your
crease it's so so easy I love how sharp
it makes it I did take that concealer
and just kind of flick out a little bit
because I knew that I was going to do a
glitter cut crease I'm also going to go
back with that tiny precise brush and a
little bit of orange shadow and just
make sure that it's totally blended on
the inner corner and then grab a makeup
wipe and clean up all the fallout and
just kind of make that wing a little bit
more precise then with more orange on a
blending brush I'm going to just make
sure that everything is completely
blended on the outer corner up towards
the brow then I'm going to go in with
the white color on the palette this is a
very shimmery very white color it's got
like a little bit of maybe a pinkish
undertone like reflects ever so slightly
can't really see it that well though
especially on camera but I'm going to
just go ahead and go right over top of
that concealer to make this really pop
and this is what's going to make that
cut crease and that line even more
intense but I didn't feel like I need to
be SuperDuper precise clean.you I was
going to go over with glitter but you
can really get in there nice and tight
and carve out with this color I'm going
to grab that gold but I felt like it was
not sticking very well so I sprayed my
brush with some fix plus of course which
I do is most shimmers because it just
makes it so much more metallic and
honestly way easier to apply I'm going
to put that in between the white and the
purple I'm going to grab more shimmery
purple put it in the crease and I'm
going to go back with more gold stamp
over top of it just go back and forth
back and forth until I have like the
perfect like ombre effect of white to
gold
to purple and then at one point I'm
going to grab my brush with a little bit
more of the white shade on it as well
and go over that just to make sure that
everything is just gradient and looks
lovely
at this moment use your best judgement
whatever you think is good good if you
want to go with more gold more purple
use ooh you boo I'm gonna grab some gel
liner difference by morphe in my last
video everyone was like oh my god Hollis
frozen over Jacqueline's not using her
Maybelline gel liner it's because I'm
all out of my Maybelline right now so
this is what I'm using but I honestly
love it it is very inky and very black
so I'm going to create a winged liner
for this look you do not have to do that
you can honestly just mascara on lashes
but I wanted to just have the full-blown
effect I haven't done like a really
intense to drama eye and what feels like
forever I'm sure it's only been like two
weeks it feels like it's been a while so
I wanted to do a really intense eye then
I'm going to grab the Urban Decay
Midnight Cowboy glitter the glitter
liner comes in a little tiny tube too
but I'm sorry that sound like I said - a
little tiny tube I love love this liner
like I can't live without it
but then I felt like it needed more of a
pop so what I did is I grabbed some eye
candy cosmetics knees are super
inexpensive and it's in the shade taffy
and it's a beautiful like rose gold
pinky shade and I thought like this
really made the look pop like I didn't
think it's a Midnight Cowboy popped as
much as I wanted it to and I want to put
this on all the key yes and I use the
litter glue and just dip my brush
directly into the glitter glue the lit
cosmetics glitter glue is hands-down the
best that I have ever used I don't know
what I did before it I do not know what
I did I'm going to just use some L'Oreal
carbon black voluminous mascara and then
I'm going to put on some false lashes
I'm going to be using the blinking
beautifu mantle lash which is one of my
favorites I mention it in my best of
beauty video because I just love how the
outer edge has like that gorgeous wispy
like flicks to it just gives like such
it just emphasizes the wing even more I
just love them now we're going to move
on to the lower lash line we're going
back in with that warm brown and I did
do my foundation concealer and powder
and I did not like put that in the video
because I saw you guys have seen that
routine 5000 times I wanted to stick to
the eyes but we will go on to the rest
of the face later so for now I'm going
to take a tiny bowl precise brush and
I'm going to run at that warm Brown
along the entire lash line then I'm
going to grab that shimmery purple I'm
going to put that right on top of it as
close to the lash line as possible using
a definer brush that one right there is
a sigma brush whenever you see that gold
handle that means it's Sigma because
it's from their extravaganza collection
but any every brand basically has that
brush get it nice and tight on the lash
line then I'm going to grab some that
orange and put that right over top again
with a really tiny pencil brush and it's
kind of layering all the exact same
colors I use on the upper lid on my
lower lash line as well to really get
this smoky and like really blended out I
felt like the lower lash is what really
brought this look together in the end I
thought it made it like everything just
pop so much more then going in with some
translucent powder and an angled brush
just to clean up that area and I would
see immediately wipe it away and it will
just give you way more of like a defined
look that way if it was like messy at
all in the lower lash line of keep it
nice and right
hi you know how we do then we act on my
brows of course using the anastacio brow
definer and a shade chocolate I got a
little heavy on my brows today I'm not
gonna lie I've been a little
heavy-handed recently and that's why I
go in with the spoolie and I brush it
out and blend it out like crazy but then
the thing I actually have to do when I'm
doing a smoky eye especially is grabbing
some concealer on a definer brush and
just blending that underneath my eye and
then basically with no more concealer
left on this brush I'm going to blend
back and forth and kind of up and down
and this is what's going to like really
blend my shadow into that concealer so
that nothing is harsh and the shadow
doesn't actually touch the brow I don't
want my shadow to touch my brow like I
want my brow bone to have like its own
moment I want it to pop on its own I
don't want my shadow all the way up
there so that's why I do that concealer
trick then taking that same chances and
powder and that same brush that I used
on the outer core my eye I'm going to
stamp it all over my brows blend out the
spoolie because it's just going to give
it way more of a natural look it was
just looking super harsh and I was like
girl you mean so innocent galva these
brows are intense then for my brow bone
highlight I'm using the artist Couture
diamond powder and a shade cocoa bling I
would recommend doing this before you
put on your false lashes though I didn't
think about it just because it will kind
of fall down on top of your lashes
you'll have to like clean them up and
dust them off but this has been like one
of my favorite brow highlights recently
it's just so pretty then using a tiny
little brush I'm going to go in with
that same exact white shadow from the
palette and just stamp that on my lower
lash line using a white liner would be
the trick but I forgot - so I use this
one instead just use a shadow and it
stays on there just the same it's
actually a great tip if you want to keep
like your liner on your waterline all
day just go over and set it with an
eyeshadow and it'll keep it on like
bulletproof all day long then I'm going
to go in with benefit hoola bronzer and
this big ol fat tomforde brush which I
love
honestly I have forgotten how much I
love hoola bronzer especially with my
super fair skin like I love this bronzer
I keep having people tell me you're not
that fair you're not that pale
I am the lightest shade of foundation
almost every single brand I'm either the
lightest or the second lightest so I am
pretty fair right now I don't know why
maybe the camera makes me look like I'm
not that fair but I am I mean you can
see I have a little bit of a yellow
undertone to me so maybe that's the
difference I don't know but trust me I
am
very light right now and I have been
loving hoola bronzer so I'm going to
grab some cover FX translucent powder
I'm going to just basically carve out
that whole area and then clean it up as
you can see I'm using that blender just
to go around and really like erase
anything blend out that entire cheek
area so it's a nice soft contour nothing
SuperDuper harsh I've been loving that
trick recently just going over and
basically erasing things and blending
things out with that powder for blush
I'm going to use an oldie but a goodie
this is the Mac Pro Longwear blush in
the shade rosy outlook it's just such a
pretty shade it just goes on so natural
and nice especially when you use a big
fluffy brush like a swan so Sigma brush
but I do not know the number but I will
put that I'll put all the brushes in the
description box to you guys and then I'm
going to just set my brows with some
clear brow gel of course
and then for highlight I'm going to be
using the J Cosmetics citrine highlight
and I chose this one for this look
because it's nice and light and it's got
like a vanilla bean to it but it also
has like a nice golden undertone because
when you're as pale as me you can't use
like an actual gold highlight because it
looks like basically yellow on your face
and it's not really flattering so this
one is a really pretty golden undertone
that I thought was very flattering to
the eye look of course I'm going to put
a little pinch on my nose my Cupid's bow
my chin if you're oily you probably want
to avoid the chin in the nose but I'm
not oily I'm dry as an alligator and
then for my lips I'm going to go in with
lip land liquid lipstick in a shade
spotlight so pretty I love this color
and I'm going to take some Kylie
cosmetics lip gloss in the shade so cute
which is her palest nude that she has
and I love I'm putting just on the
center of the lips like a pow a glossy
look I'm going to set everything with
makeup forever
mission fix and this look is complete I
hope you guys love it thank you so much
for watching and I will see you guys in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
