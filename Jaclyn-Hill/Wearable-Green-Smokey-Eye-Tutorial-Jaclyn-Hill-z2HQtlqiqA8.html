background I'm finally home after a
month of being away and it is so nice to
be back and settled in I was in
Minnesota for my Sigma meet-and-greet
and then in Chicago for three weeks for
vacation and then in Tampa for F for
another meet-and-greet and now I'm home
thank you so much to all of you who came
to Miami and greets you guys have
absolutely no idea what an honor and
privilege it was for me to be there and
meet you guys and put some faces to the
people that I'm speaking to on social
media and the Internet it's just it was
so surreal and so amazing thank you so
much for the gifts and the presence and
the cookies and the um socks like Hello
whoever gave me Shih Tzu socks you guys
are amazed all's as promised since I am
home I'm going to jump right back into
the swing of things and get back to
makeup tutorials I'm starting off I'm
going to be doing this green smokey eye
this is very fall appropriate it's gonna
look good on everybody but especially
brown eyes brown eyes will really shine
in this look but the technique anybody
can use it's a very different technique
I don't know I think I might have done
it once in a video before it'll make
your eyes look bigger and rounder and
just bring more attention to them so
yeah I really hope you enjoy and if you
have any questions don't forget to check
my description bar below my video I
always have so many things down there
discount codes information every product
I use details of everything so yeah I
really hope you guys enjoyed the video
and I'll see you soon bye
I'm starting off by priming my eyelids
it's mac prolongwear concealer I'm using
shade and w20 if you watch my videos you
know that this step never changes I
always use this as a primer as a
technology to not crease and settle in
any fine lines and it goes in and
concealed any blood vessels or redness
you might want to cover I'm giggling
throughout this whole video because I'm
watching Ferris Bueller's Day Off as I'm
recording so I'm sorry I'm going in with
makeup geeks Peach Smoothie eyeshadow
and Sigma Z 40 blending brush and I'm
going to use this as a transition shade
as you can see I am just throwing it in
my crease all the way from inner corner
to outer corner back and forth and
windshield wiper and circular motions
just to ensure that it's completely
buffed out that way these colors don't
have any harsh lines then I'm going in
with makeup geek makeup geek creme
brulee eyeshadow and an e25 blending
brush this is more of a tapered blending
brush so you can get more precise in the
crease area and I'm doing the exact same
motions from inner corner to outer
corner back and forth and I'm using a
very generous amount of this as you can
see I'm not being light handed I want
this to be dark and smoky just as
pigmented on the inner corner as the
outer then I'm going in with the Urban
Decay vice to palatal and I'm going to
use this green shade right here called
stash this is a really really beautiful
deep dark sparkly glittery green the
moment I saw it it was the first color I
was drawn to in this palette so I'm
going to use an e 55 shadow brush by
Sigma and just pack this all over the
lid starting at the base by the lashes
and then working your way up to the
crease once you get to that crease area
where you see I am right now you don't
want to put any additional product on
that brush you just want to go back and
forth back and forth to blend it out
don't get frustrated if you have to
blend back and forth for a minute or two
because you don't want it to look like
my right eye right now you want it to
look like the left so you don't want any
harsh lines so just keep blending back
and forth back and forth in that crease
and wiggling it around then go back with
the blending brush and just kind of buff
it out to ensure that there are no harsh
edges and everything is buffed out
perfectly then I'm going to go in with
Anastasia lavish palette I know I'm
bouncing around
palette palette palette today I'm going
to use this color moss basically what
I'm doing is packing this just in the
center of my lid as you can see it's a
lighter color green so we want the
darkest green to be the base and then
moss is going to go in the center just
to bring us a little bit more light as I
have talked about many times before when
you use a lighter shade it's going to
make something pop out that's why we
highlight the cheekbones so when you put
a lighter shade in the middle of the eye
it's going to make it look rounder I'm
going in with another palette a few of
my favorite things by Too Faced this
palette is so amazing it is absolutely
gorgeous and I'm going in with the shade
tinsel it's an even lighter color green
and I'm barely going to touch that just
in the center ball of my eye and this is
totally an unnecessary step but I'm just
showing you guys what you can do to
really get your eyes to pop so darkest
all over the lid and then lighter
lighter lighter gradually in the center
you want to make it pop even more you
can pretty the lighter color like just
dab it right in the center then I'm
going in with Inglot gel liner I bought
this at Macy's when I was in Chicago
I've never used any in glass products
before us this is my first time using
the liner I really really like it as you
saw it is like black as night so I just
thought that I'll try out and so far so
good
I'm just cleaning up the excess using a
makeup wipe and then I'm going to go in
and put on just a super thin layer of
mascara just so that I can pop on some
false lashes without my natural lashes
looking like they're all pale and green
and then I'm using the lower lashes and
strike a pose I have told you guys a
million times velour lashes are my
absolute favorite you can see what a
difference they make they're so
beautiful and since you can use them
like 25 times
I just keep using the same pairs over
and over and over then I'm using a YSL
foundation the touchy clot and I'm in
shade b40 using a sigma f80 brush that i
use in every single video every single
day of my life I'm just going to buff
this all around my face and then I'm
going to use Pro Longwear concealer in
nw20 the same one I use to prime my eyes
as a concealer underneath I am using a
sigma kabuki brush I'm not sure which
one this is but as always I'll have all
the brushes and information listed down
with links and so on and so forth so I'm
just highlighting with this color
blending it make sure you press nice and
deep in the under eye area that way it
prevents anything from settling in the
little fine lines that we have and then
I'm going to set that concealer with
these two Mac Pro powders they can be
purchased at mac cosmetics calm you do
not have to go to a pro store order to
get these I'll list all that information
below as well and using a sigma
highlighting brush I'm just going to dab
that all around so that my concealer
does not move this is like the most
highly asked question that I get in my
videos is my brows and so I will be
doing an in-depth brow tutorial soon so
I'm kind of skipping over this quickly I
use the Anastasia brow Wiz and soft
brown for those of you who are curious
I'm going to be highlighting my under
brow area with shroom which is an eye
shadow by Mac I also forgot to mention I
will be doing an in-depth lash tutorial
in the next week or so to show how to
apply false lashes because it's one of
the biggest requests that I have then
I'm just going to run over my lashes
just to cover up the lash line in the
first place just using any black liquid
liners which you can't see the base of
the lashes it'll just make it look a
little bit more natural then when that
new black eyeshadow in an angled brush
I'm just going to push this up against
my lash lines focusing just in the outer
corner of my eye I am going back with
the same brush that I used to apply my
eyeliner which is the e65 and the same
Inglot eyeliner and pushing this in my
waterline you can see what a difference
that makes
and this liner lasted and it did not
make my eyes burn so I have super
sensitive eyes and they get red from
everything and this did not do that with
any pencil brush I'm just buffing out
the outer edges I'm not dragging us in
I'm just concentrating on the outer
corner to give that really smoked out
almost cat eye look that way it's not
too dramatic and over the top then I'm
just coating my lower lashes with
L'Oreal full definition voluminous
mascara I always forget what it's called
and then after that I'm going to go in
and contour myself with hoola bronzer by
benefit if you want to see an in-depth
video of how I contour and all the steps
that I take and exactly why I will link
that video down below I do use this NARS
brush it is like my
holy grail brush eversince I purchased
it it's the only way I contour you can
see what an awesome precise line it
gives and it blends out it's just the
brush is amazing it's one of the best
brushes I've ever used
in makeup I think so I'm going to go up
on the top of my forehead as well just a
little bit not tons I don't want to do
over-the-top bronzing I really want my
eyes to be the main focus of this so
just a little bit now I'm going to go in
with Milani blush in the color alumina
so this is a really beautiful pinky
coral shade it's got a really nice hint
of peach in it and I'm just going to dab
this on the apples of my cheeks and
dragging it back a little bit and
blending it into that contour and then
I'm going to go in with Physicians
Formula highlight I'm not quite sure the
name of this highlight I forgot I
mentioned it in my favorites video I'll
just sit below though it's a really nice
subtle highlight so I'll have that
information down below and then I'm
going to just wipe off the foundation I
have on my lips and you can see that my
natural color lips are very red and very
bright people are always asking what
lipstick I'm wearing so that was kind of
the color that I wanted my lips to be
and so I'm using makeup geek lipstick
and adorable I believe it is I'll double
check and once again put in the
description bar but I thought that that
was the prettiest most complementary
color to these eyes I didn't want
anything too pale or anything with too
much color to disrupt the eyeshadow so
I'm just going to go over it with Revlon
Bellini lip gloss and after that you are
all done so I really hope you guys enjoy
this fall look and I will see you my
next video love you bye
