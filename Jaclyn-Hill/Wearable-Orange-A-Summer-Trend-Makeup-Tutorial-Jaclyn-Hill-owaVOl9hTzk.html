a makeup tutorial and honest to god I
have no idea what I'm calling this yet I
am so scatterbrained right now I just
literally grabbed some eyeshadow sat
down and just filmed this as I was
coming up with it in the mirror so
typically I am much more thought-out and
put together before I film a tutorial
for you but this was just like look I
was inspired to do this because twice
yesterday I saw in a magazine article
and on a TV show how orange eye shadow
is so on-trend for summer but so many
people are intimidated by the color and
don't know how to wear it so I was like
got it because if you watch my channel
and if you are new to my channel the
first thing you should know about me is
I am orange obsessed anything warm brown
orange corals gold yellows I just I love
so I thought that I would do a tutorial
for you guys showing you how all of you
can get an orange eyeshadow look that is
not overwhelming it's not going to be
scary and is going to complement all
shades this look is really going to make
light eyes such as mine Bluegreen hazel
eyes really bright and really stand out
they're very complimentary sorry I'm
like talking so much with my hands way
too enthused about this situation my
personal favorite eye color for this
look though is brown eyes any time that
I use these shadows on a brown eyed girl
oh so beautiful it will just make the
honey stand out in your brown eyes and
just really shine through so this really
will look good on all eye colors and as
you will see in the tutorial it is so
easy to achieve so I'm gonna stop
rambling everything if you guys enjoy
this video sorry for being a little all
over the place in a little wacky
Jackie's always but I love you guys so
much thanks for watching and I'll see
you later hi hey guys
so the first thing I'm going to be doing
today is applying lip balm I am using
the sugar lip treatment it's always a
good idea to moisturize your lips before
you apply your makeup so they don't get
dried out then I'm using an oldie but a
goodie L'Oreal True Match Lumi
foundation I'm using my Sigma f80 flat
top kabuki brush to press this into my
skin this foundation is ideal for
somebody who is dry to normal and skin
type because it has such a beautiful
dewy luminosity to it it does not have
any glitter or any shimmer or sparkle in
it it just gives a really dewy fresh
face glow I
love it it is from the drugstore but it
feels much more like a high-end
luxurious foundation it is beautiful on
the skin then we're going to go in with
mac prolongwear concealer and I'm going
to tap this starting in the inner corner
of my eye
lightly dragging it down make sure
you're very careful towards the temple
and then going in with Sigma F 86 this
is not technically a concealer brush but
I use it as a concealer brush because
since it has the synthetic fibers it
really soaks up the excess concealer so
if you're somebody who can accidentally
be too heavy-handed on your concealer
application this will really soak up the
excess product so that you won't have
creasing or cake under eye area then we
are going to go in with Mac Pro soft
focus which is the yellow shade and
emphasize which is the white one and
we're going to mix them together and
just tap this underneath the eye area to
set that concealer using a sigma tapered
highlighter brush I use this brush for
many different things and this is one of
them I'm currently out of my Anastasia
banana color powder so I am using the
soft focus one instead which is
absolutely ideal for anybody who is a
little bit darker and skin toned than me
but I'm making it work then I'm going to
fill in my brows just like normal and
I'm using Anastasia brow is now I am
using oh yeah look at the difference in
those brows baby I am using a different
shade accidentally like I told you I'm a
little over the place today accidentally
using the wrong shade to fill in my
brows so because of that they come out
looking a little ashy today but we can
see past that and just move right along
I'm filling them in like normal though
no intense like shaping or anything just
a typical brow fill situation then we're
going to move on to eyeshadow I'm using
makeup geek Peach Smoothie and a sigma
e40 fluffy brush and I'm going to dust
this from inner corner to outer corner
as you can see I am lightly building it
up but I'm starting off with just a tiny
amount of eyeshadow and just making it
more intense as we go it is so important
to start off with a light color like
this higher up in the crease this will
really make it so that you're blending
just comes out perfectly start with a
light color first then move downward and
darker shades going in with makeup geek
chickadee and an e 35 brush an e 35
brush is a more taper brush it has
less hairs and it is longer so it's
going to blend a little bit more
precisely and get deeply in that crease
so I'm going all the way from inner
corner to outer corner back and forth
and windshield wiper motions then back
with the e-40 to buff it out you can use
more Peach Smoothie if you want you
don't have to just make sure you blend
blend blend and winchell wiper motions
this is the part of the tutorial where I
accidentally didn't record the majority
of me applying eye shadow so I am going
to explain to you exactly what I do I am
using makeup geek glamorous eye shadow
as you can see right here in this clip
it is a beautiful bronzy gold shade it
is more of a rose gold with some copper
tones in it it is absolutely gorgeous
we're putting that all over the lid from
inner corner to outer corner then we're
going to take makeup geek gold digger i
shadow we're going to put that on top of
the shade glamorous in the ball of our
eye so right in the center of that lid
we're going to put gold digger over top
just to get a pop so now you have that
bronzy copper and gold going on on that
lid then we're going to mix chickadee
and cocoa bear and rub that all over the
lower lash line and then last but not
least we're gonna highlight the inner
corner and the brow with Becca opal
highlighter such an amazing highlight
look at that thing it's beaming it's
amazing and then we are going to get
back to reality okay we are now applying
the lower lashes and wispy sweet
nothings these are like my top three
favorite lashes of life I just
absolutely love them and I am using a
different glue than normal this is a
house of lashes I ran out of my duo glue
this month and so I have been using this
for a few weeks and so far I really
really love it so no liner just lashes
then I am going to take that gold digger
shade on any brush that you choose and
I'm going to push on my lower waterline
if you lightly push the waterline will
flip out and you can get an easier
application without causing wrinkles and
tugging on that lower waterline it might
seem weird that I'm using eyeshadow
instead of eyeliner but for people who
have sensitive eyes eye shadow can
actually work better because it doesn't
hurt or burn your eyes at all as opposed
to some liners and it really will stay
for a long time then I'm just going to
coat my lower lashes with lashes with
matte gigablack mascara and this should
be your eye look
so far so very gold very warm not
overboard in the orange right I think
it's the perfect amount of orange then
we're going to go in with Mac care blend
pressed powder in the shade dark using
the NARS eita brush I'm going to lightly
contour I do not want to do a heavy
contouring but I do want to do a little
so we are just going to buff this out on
the cheekbone and then around the
temples and the hairline I typically
don't like to go too far down on my
forehead I like to leave a nice circle
and the center of the forehead as a
highlight and then I just contour by the
hairline on the outer portions of my
forehead make sure you blend then we're
going to go in with Becca cosmetics
songbird blush this is such a pretty
color we are going to start on the apple
of the cheeks and just work backward
blending it into that contour and going
backward on the face towards the temple
just make sure you lightly dust and
blend and then we're going to go in with
Mac Global glow this is a newer
highlighter - Mac and this is my first
time using it and as you can see I am
already a fan this is really beautiful
on someone with my skin tone over top of
a blush if you want to use this as a
specific highlight on the face you're
going to need to be a few shades Tanner
than I am then we're going to go in with
the Mac limited edition lipstick in the
shade what rose this is very similar to
blankety so it would be ideal for
somebody who is again a shade or two
darker and skin tone than me I'm getting
all you tan girls many recommendations
throughout this video then I'm going to
go over that with color your smile coral
craze which is a new lip gloss by them
it is a nudie peachy pinky coral shade
it is absolutely beautiful so after that
your look is complete I hope that you
guys enjoyed this video I love you so
much
