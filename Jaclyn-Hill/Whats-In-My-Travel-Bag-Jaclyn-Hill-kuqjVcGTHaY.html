what's in my travel bag video kind of
like a what's in my bag video what's in
my purse video what's in my suitcase
video we're gonna be doing a what is in
my travel bag video which is basically
just the bag that I carry with me when I
am flying and I am traveling so what I
travel I do not carry a purse growing up
I traveled all the time I would carry so
much with me it was ridiculous like I
would have a person then I don't have a
carry-on bag and then I would have like
a carry-on suitcase and it was just
miserable
walking to the airport and then you
always want to bring a jacket because
it's always cold and it's just like it's
so much and I personally get very
anxious when I travel very easily like I
can have a very pleasant experience but
then like one little thing will set me
over the edge I'll be like oh this is
too much I can't take it as get very
stressed out very easily so I have
learned to like condense like
consolidate and make things easier when
I travel and keep things as light as
possible so when I am traveling and I am
flying I only bring one bag and that is
it that's the only thing I carry with me
is one bag that way all I have to do is
think about this one piece and nothing
else in my mind just stays at ease if
you know what I'm saying these guys I'm
telling you
so as for my actual bag it is a
camouflage green bag which I love I
absolutely adore camo I think that it is
so fun especially this bag because of
like the gold studs on the side it just
makes it a little bit more girly and
glamorous
some people hate camouflage I love it I
think it's so fun to work with and I
just think it's so cute umm I treat camo
as a neutral I know a lot of people I've
heard say they like a hard time wearing
camel mats I don't buy it
I treat it like a neutral bag I wear it
the same way I would wear like a black
bag or a brown bag I just use it as my
gigantic pop of camo I love love this
bag I have my eye on it for months
before I purchased it and it is amazing
it is so huge it fits everything in here
like you could put like a couple of kids
in here and you wouldn't even know that
is by Valentino yes it is a designer bag
and I do not want to have to go through
the whole disclaimer and justifying my
purchase because I feel like I have to
do that any time I ever mention anything
designer on my channel but I'm trying to
stop
because so many of you guys get after me
and you're like stop justifying your
purchases so I have been listening to
you guys recently so let's move on to
what is inside the bag so the first and
most important thing to me when I travel
hands down is my iPad I cannot live
without this if I flew without my iPad I
would probably not get on the plane like
I'm not being dramatic this is so
important to me because I am an anxious
flier and I have learned the only thing
that really makes me like ah chill and
laid-back on the plane is watching
movies or TV shows or whatever that may
be so this is my iPad Mini I just think
it's so much easier and smaller than the
regular iPad obviously but it still gets
the job done and I can still watch
movies just fine so the actual case is
from Kate Spade I got it from Nordstrom
like a year and a half ago or so and it
opens up in the back like a picture
frame so you can like rest its I
purchase any movies or TV shows in the
iTunes store and then it just downloads
directed to your iPad and then you have
it right there saved into your videos
folder so these are the movies I
currently have on my iPad right now
ready to go
The Devil Wears Prada How to Lose a Guy
in 10 days it's complicated just friends
just go with it just married Wow I
realize how many movies I have with the
word just as the first word the title
that's weird Miss Congeniality my best
friend's wedding the other woman and
pitch perfect
I can't wait for pitch perfect to to
come out also need to download Sex and
the City and bridesmaids I would love to
have those two on here as well and in TV
shows I have a couple seasons of friends
and the sixth season of Modern Family so
yes I take my movies very seriously on
the plane as the plane takes off I'm
like getting on my iPad and tuning in oh
my god time to relax so next I have my
headphones I've mentioned this in my
what's in my purse video back in the day
these are the exact same headphones
they're the Bose headphones I swear to
god they're like the best headphones in
the world and what I love about these is
not only the sound that it gives but on
top of it the actual headphone part is
super squishy and you don't realize how
much you love that until you need to
take a nap on the plane and if you're
watching a movie and you like rest your
head they're squishy and they're like
little pillows on the side of your face
then I just have my wallet obviously
necessary I have
little adapter that is really an awesome
invention but it actually doesn't work I
don't know if it's my iPad that is
messed up Orbitz this adapter that's
messed up but basically what it is is
you plug this into your iPad and then
two people can both use headphones at
the same time so my mom and I will both
watch a movie together at the same time
on the iPad with this little adapter
it's from Best Buy they're inexpensive
they're like 9 to 10 bucks but this one
is not working and I actually think it's
my iPad because this is the second one
that hasn't worked recently so I think
it's me I have a pair of sunglasses I
just bring these for obvious reasons
when I'm in the airport a lot of times I
will wear sunglasses and look like a
douche bag because I don't like to
travel I kind of want to be like leave
me alone
so these sunglasses are by saline they
are gigantic as you can tell I look like
a bug um but that's what makes them
perfect for traveling when I travel I go
to LA I'm taking a very early morning
flight I look like a zombie and so I
bring my sunglasses along to cover up
thy face I have a pair of socks with me
because I cannot travel without socks
because my feet are always freezing I am
just like such a cold blooded person
it's so ridiculous by even bring socks
with me when I go to the movie theater
like I'm not kidding like even if I'm
wearing heels
I will bring a pair of socks in my bag
like in my clutch and pull them out and
put on socks movie theories my toes are
always freezing it doesn't matter like
what temperature I'm in so I always have
to have socks with me and I love these
because it legit looks like Frankie and
Georgie on here so I always have to have
socks I have a pack of gum I actually
have two packs of gum right here um I
have a sleep mask which is just a
standard sleep mask
nothing like super duper cute but they
came with pajama pants that I bought at
Victoria's Secret so I use a sleep mask
I'm on the plane like I'm serious about
getting some rest I'll put on my sleep
mask so that I can actually like zone
out I have a little baby tub of body
butter this is by the blissful body as
you guys know I've mentioned the
blissful body many times it's my
favorite bad body butter of all time I
could barely get that one out and so I
just carry this with me when I travel
because my hands are so dry all the time
when I'm try
Blayne I absolutely hate the feeling of
dry hands and when I travel my hands get
extra dry not just because of the fact
that we're 36,000 feet in the air
but also because I am a little bit of a
germaphobe so I washed my hands
constantly when I travel and the more
wash my hands the drier my hands get so
I am always using this and it is such
nice thick moisturizing body butter I
love it then I have a bottle of fix+
I threw this bottle in this bag right
before I've done this video just for the
purpose of the video because my mom is
actually asked them all right now and
she's picking me up another travel size
fix plus because I just ran out of it
and I don't have it to show you guys
anymore
um but this is just in here for the
purpose of the video but when I actually
travel I will have a fixed plus but it's
a mini travel sized bottle and I can't
live without that when I travel I will
spray fix+ in my face two or three times
during the flight and I swear it's just
such a lifesaver because all that
recycled air just makes my skin so dry
that I'm not joking being dry as it is
after getting off of a five-hour flight
all the way this I know big ah my face
feels like it's gonna crack cause it
just feels so dry so spraying this all
over my face a few times during the
flight just keeps my skin so hydrated
and is a lifesaver in the side pocket
over here I just have my phone charger
BYOC bring your own charger my phone is
constantly dying so I finally learned to
carry a charger with me because I cannot
stand being in an airport being anywhere
and not having a phone it's like it's
like a butt-naked and then the last
thing in the bag is just this little
baggie right here that is just the bag
of tricks filled with all sorts of
little gadgets um I have an emergency
packet which is just vitamin seed okay
my camera just like turned off in
mid-sentence because it was apparently
overheated and I was like get it
together I have a little mirror and my
bad because my entire life I have never
carried a mirror with me it's so weird
right like all the makeup that I have
and I do I never carry a mirror with me
it's so weird but I'm always asking
people loosening my ID give a mirror who
I need to touch on method lost you've a
mirror and oh my gift together
Jacqueline and get yourself a mirror so
I have this little mirror right here the
House of lashes sent to me as a lash
game strong on the back of it and it's
perfect because it's just so tiny and
that so now I finally have been carrying
a me recently and I'm like yeah I've
been adult it's the little things so
then I just have fragrance and here I
have three different fragrances these I
bring with me in my bag even though
these are going to be what I use at my
destination so like these are my fig
rinses that I'll use while I'm on my
trip but I bring them with me because
airports can be really disgusting and
really disturb me and like I've said I'm
a germaphobe so I bring things that
smell good because if someone next to me
has like rancid bol just big so I have
Coco Chanel Mademoiselle and then I have
this one from Anthropologie and I don't
doesn't have like a name on it or
anything it smells like a garden and
then I have Daisy by Marc Jacobs which
like I've said before I bring this with
me when I travel because the smell the
scent just makes me think of a wonderful
times it's the scent that I wore on my
wedding day as cheesy as that is and it
just makes me think of good times makes
me think of John so I'm out of town I
travel I smell this and it just takes me
to a happy place did you know that scent
is the number one thing in a human brain
to trigger memory isn't that crazy like
out of all of our senses like a scent
can bring back memories like the easiest
and the fastest isn't that so cool I
love that this is the sugar advanced lip
treatment by fresh this is just like the
basic one that doesn't have a tint and
it doesn't have an SPF in it my favorite
one it smells just like lemonade and
it's very moisturizing and then I have
just this little tiny Ziploc baggie and
the reason why I carry this is because
you might be wondering like oh can you
actually take these types of things with
you because they're liquid you can carry
liquid with you anything less than 2
ounces when you're traveling but if
someone insecurity is a real stickler
they'll tell you that your liquids have
to fit into a small ziploc bag so like
legit I bring this with me my person if
someone gives me a hard time I literally
take my liquid put them in the bag and
zip it up and they're like okay you're
good to go I know that's the most ram
thing in the world right but this is
what I've learned your liquids have to
be less than 2 ounces each and they have
to all be able to be condensed into a
small Ziploc baggie so there you have it
and then last but of course not least I
have hand sanitizer
and tampons just keeping it real okay so
that is it for what is in my travel bagg
video maybe my carry-on video I'm not
really sure what I'm calling this video
yet but yeah that completes everything
that is in my bag for when I am
traveling I feel like it's not that much
personally I am just by nature and
over-packer but this is the place I have
come to that this is all I need when I
travel and I feel like it's the perfect
amount where I'm not overwhelmed but yet
I have everything that I need so that is
how I do it so I will actually be in
California when this video is uploaded
it's kind of like we're in the future
not really but maybe a little bit this
is actually going to be the longest trip
that I have taken since I was a teenager
I'm gonna be away from home for 14 days
14 days that's a long time to be gone
I'm gonna miss Chun so much and Frankie
and Georgie oh my god Frankie's gonna
change so much while I'm gone it's gonna
be weird I haven't been gone for that
long
since I was like 16 years old from my
home so it's gonna be really strange but
yeah I'm already looking forward to
getting back and getting kind of more
routine and filming videos for you guys
and when I get back I'll finally have my
new camera so I'll be able to do
tutorials for you and the month of
September is such a chill month like I
don't have anything booked in September
so I will literally just be dedicated to
YouTube and I'm already looking forward
to it but this trip is so necessary I
have been waiting for this trip I've had
this trip scheduled since March we are
knocking out so many things that need to
be taken care of for business so I'm
excited to go and power through the next
14 days and I will see you guys soon
they say absence makes the heart grow
fonder right I guess we're about to find
out if that statement is true so yeah
thank you so much you guys for watching
this video I hope that you enjoyed and
I'll see you guys soon bye I went if any
of you were wondering what lip color I'm
wearing today it's Veronica liquid
lipstick by Anastasia of Beverly Hills
oh I'm a bum cheerleader she is always a
fair when you need her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
