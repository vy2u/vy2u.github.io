about these videos years ago someone was
like oh yeah these girls on YouTube they
just make video showing all the crap
inside their purse and people love it
and there's millions of views and I was
like what the hell is wrong with this
world and now I'm like hey what's inside
my bad video hey guys so as you can tell
I'm sitting in a different part of my
house today but I'm just sick of the
same scenery in every single video like
I'm honestly bored with myself like
seeing the refrigerator in the
background and it's just it's getting
old and plus I like my couch and I like
sitting in my living room
so yes this is my couch and I'm sitting
in front of it I posted a picture of it
on Instagram recently and a lot of
people were asking about these pillows
and this guy right here really sparkly
one is from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and then
this one like nothing but sequins and
beads is from home goods and they are
both there right now basically I'm gonna
show you all the crap inside of my bag
so that you guys can be like wow you're
even weirder than we expected so let's
just jump into it I want this to be a
short video so first of all my bag it's
like a taupe um brownish whatever muave
color I don't know if you can really see
the color um anyways it's from Nordstrom
in the BP section it was only fifty
dollars which I love because I am a
handbag freak but I don't like keeping a
same handbag for a long time and when I
have designer bags I'm just over it and
just whatever I can't stick to a bag and
commit to it for a long time so I'd like
to get cheap bags that way I can just do
my thing I move on and no I did not go
through here I did not clean it out or
try to hide any of my dirty secrets I
put in my bag and I was like okay I
don't know if this is gonna be
interesting or not but whatever so many
people have asked me to do this and I
think it's so funny I'm like try not to
laugh at myself but I'm doing it so I'm
just I'm doing it saying is my makeup
bag which is just like this crap bag
from forever 21 um I'm not gonna go
inside here because that's a whole 20
minute video on itself but there's just
like a little pixie in there yeah oh
Lord okay but that is going to be
no not now oh hey so when I look into my
bag the first thing I see is my wallet
again it's nothing really exciting um
this is a Michael Kors wallet I got it
on sale at UM a Bloomingdale's outlet is
originally like 140 or something and I
got it for like sixty so I was like okay
um yeah if I could go back and buy it
again I wouldn't because I haven't even
had it for a year and it's completely
falling apart and I take good care of my
wallet so I don't understand why okay
next I have a schedule my schedule for
November so you guys can come stock me
at Nordstrom okay no but seriously we
get our schedule an entire month ahead
of time and it makes it kind of hard to
live my life because I don't know what
I'm going to be doing in a month from
now like our entire December schedule is
coming out like this week it's like I
don't know what days I need off in
December that's a month and a half now
okay so like whatever all I'm saying is
like getting you feel me if you picture
schedule ahead of time it's not all that
fun okay next thing is a teasing brush
comb that I don't use but it's in there
just you never know I have hair spray
and this is I don't know this brand and
I rarely use it but it's like there were
like two days in the same week where I
was like nobody in this entire
department has hair spray and I was so
annoyed that I finally was at CVS one
day like okay I'm buying hairspray and I
throw to my person I haven't needed it
since so whatever um hello tide pen oh
my god I am obsessed with this except
it's never around me when I need it to
be near me because when I'm at work I
have to keep to something like a locker
upstairs and I can only bring
bag with me and so whenever explicitly
on myself this is like a mile away and
I'm like oh great
covered in something and I don't have my
type in but if you guys have not used
this it is amazeballs
then I have sunglasses they're from
forever 21 they're really cheap and
they're really ugly because I don't care
and then I have another pair of
sunglasses in my inner pocket which are
Ray Ban aviators um they're just like
normal
aviators they're not anything special
and they look kind of like Mad Max I
have hand sanitizer
because the world is disgusting and I
don't want to be part of it have hand
moisturizer this is hand lotion this
smells like oh my God look at how
retarded I am
nothing likes me in this world like
hello you are supposed to be in there
really this this is a cap okay but
anyways it's not like oranges and I love
it and apparently it's been sitting
upside down for a long time so right I
have a Tampa pen pencil I mean because
I'm obsessed with Tampa and when I
didn't live here I was really depressed
and then my husband bought this for me
in the airport and I like sat on the
airplane back to Massachusetts crying
hey I have Carmack's I'm obsessed with
keeping my lips moisturized like I know
this isn't the only moisturizer in here
but I have Carmex oh yeah and then I
have Burt's Bees and then I have an EOS
lip balm this is the sweet mint one I
wish I could just give it to you guys
smell that smell it I'm very dry so
anything moisturizing my hand my body my
face my lips whatever I I want it all um
oh hey yes I just bought this this is
why this is still in here this is revlon
black cherry lipstick and i bought this
because of heidi cupcake if you haven't
seen her on you - she is so freaking
adorable she has like the edgiest style
and I love her and she mentioned this
and I was like oh my god I have to
I was on her lips and it was gorgeous
and I used it once and it's gorgeous it
is amazing I have a newfound love for
Revlon lipsticks I own a few of them but
now that I have this one I'm like you
are my obsession for the fall here I'll
put on my pants as you guys can see it
but you really should just go watch a
video because oh yes
and I have Rhodos I don't know if you
guys have ever tried these before
obviously because I don't know you these
are the most amazing eye drops of all
time this isn't the one I like I like
them with the green cap this one
literally feels like icebergs are
piercing your eyeballs it was seriously
gets the redness out of your eyes like
Zapotec oh my god think of bobby pins um
in this little case I don't know I got
it at Walgreens but I like it because I
can keep my boxers in there and I have a
little sample in my purse I get samples
of perfume every single day it's
actually kind of bad working in
Nordstrom instead of like buying
perfumes I just go over to fragrance and
I'm like give me that I want it in a
sample cup so oh oh no oh no in my
outside pocket I have tanning goggles
because I like to sometimes not practice
what I preach and go fry my skin I used
to have a friend who and it was sunny
outside she would literally ride around
in the car with these on her head and
it's like what the hell are you doing go
buy a pair cyclos being a makeup artist
I basically just want to put people's
eyes out with my gum and then baptize
them with my mouthwash like these are
necessary before you book an appointment
I think I'm done I've got a ton of
change in the bottom of my purse I have
oh one of my business cards right there
I'll cover up my phone number unless you
want to give me a call just let me know
Oh more hand moisturizer this is the EOS
m moisturizer I love this stuff because
it's like a little egg I even know it's
in there it's so tiny and I just let the
weight shape because it's so easy but
it's not as moisturizing as this one and
that's why I have this one because
finding a lot of moisture on my nails
okay and then this is the last thing
which is
a expensive watch just hanging out at
the bottom of my bag I'm just I'm awful
this is my Michael Kors watch I feel
like everybody in their entire mother
has a Michael Kors watch now it's like
it's such a big deal but um I don't know
if I can see it that's I'm in the
correct time because I haven't even
changed his back but yeah this is my
Michael Kors watch and I got it at the
Nordstrom anniversary sale two years ago
I believe and I have it in my purse that
I can put on when I go to work and then
last but not least I have a butterscotch
candy on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
