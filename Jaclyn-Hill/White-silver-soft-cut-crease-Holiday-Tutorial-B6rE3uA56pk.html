be on this silver and white cool tone
soft cut crease perfect for the holidays
thank you so much for everyone who
requested a look incorporating these
colors you guys totally got me out of my
comfort zone so if you like what you see
it go ahead and please subscribe and
let's get started I was freezing while
filming this video so I'm gonna be
wearing this gigantic robe I hope you
guys don't mind I know I look like a
polar bear but I'm gonna start off by
priming my face using the cover FX
illuminating primer this is my first
time using it and I actually really
liked it then I'm gonna be going in with
the LC micro silk foundation and I am
using the morphe m4 3:9 foundation brush
and I did spritz it with some mac fix+
because mac fix+ has glycerin in it and
it's 90% water so it just makes the skin
super hydrated and it actually helps the
foundation to stick to your skin and to
the foundation itself for concealer
today I'm going to be using the new Make
Up For Ever HD concealer this is my
third time now using it and I am loving
this concealer it goes on very very
creamy I was nervous it was going to be
super Creasy when I first applied it cuz
it was very very dewy and very creamy
but this is like I said my third time
trying it and I've set it with a powder
each time and I've been loving it it's a
very full coverage it blends out really
beautifully I'm not getting any creasing
throughout the day it looks nice and
natural I'm I'm really loving it you
guys so now I'm going to set everything
using the Laura Mercier loose
translucent setting powder I'm going to
make the most attractive face of life to
set the under eye area as always and I'm
going to run this brush across my entire
face I'm going to completely mattify
myself which I actually wish I didn't do
once this look was over I was like I
wish I was a little bit dewier for this
specific look but that's okay cuz life
goes on even when you have a matte face
so now for the eyes I'm going to start
off using the Mac shadow in the shade
kid and I'm initially going in with the
morphe m4 4-1 brush I'm going to try to
keep this high up in the crease area as
you can see I'm not going to go on the
lid because of the fact that we're doing
a cut crease the shadow kit is
absolutely amazing if you are looking
for an amazing transition color that's
not too warm not too cool I would really
highly suggest the shade kid it's so
wearable now I'm going to go in with
Bobby Brown cement and as you can see
this is a very nice light
pale cool gray and now I'm using a
smaller blending brush and this is the
morphe m4 33 because we're gonna get a
little bit tighter in that crease as you
can see I'm still not going on the lid
I'm staying just in that crease area and
I'm going to keep it only in that upper
crease now another Bobby Brown eyeshadow
this is hot stone which is just a darker
gray from the cement I'm really going
one step at a time because when you're
doing a cut crease you don't want to
initially just go in like with this
intense dark color it's going to be kind
of difficult to blend out so I like to
start with a light shade and go one
darker one darker one darker and that's
really going to give you that really
beautiful blended effect so that's just
you know lessons in blending 101 now
we're going to go in with Anastasia deep
brown this is a very deep brown 100%
cool shade and now I am using the morphe
M 507 and this is a very tiny precise
brush that's perfect for a look like
this when you're doing a cut crease so
as you can see I'm only keeping this on
the outer corner of the eye I'm not
going to bring this all the way into the
inner corner otherwise we're gonna start
to look very 60s which is super cool but
not what I'm going for in this specific
look so I'm keeping it on the outer
corner and I want the main darkness to
be right on the outer edge of my eye and
kind of fade it up as we go then I'll go
back with that 4-3-3 brush and just make
sure that's blended out I which is just
going back in with a little bit of kid
or cement one of those light shades on
your brush just a little bit just to
blend that out so that nothing is harsh
again avoiding the actual lid area
strictly staying on the upper crease
once I blended that out I realized I
want to just touch more of the Anastasia
so I went back and with just a little
bit more of deep Brown now I'm going to
go in with this makeup forever palette
this is a new palette at Sephora I love
these shadows they are so pigmented so
beautiful and I wanted to go in with
this really bright white if you don't
have this palette I would suggest
something like Mac crystal avalanche or
like Mac vanilla pigment you could even
just use like a NYX like jumbo white
pencil
but I really love these shadows and I
had the palette sitting in front of me
so I wanted to use them and as you can
see they are pigmented as heck this is
not using a wet brush or anything this
is just the color payoff which is so
amazing so I am using a Mac 242 to apply
that which is just a flat top synthetic
hair brush and that will any flat
synthetic brush will apply like
shimmers the best and now we're going to
be going in with Mack Platinum pigment
this is my favorite silver of all time
it is a true silver platinum and I'm
going to put this on the middle of the
eye and the outer area of the eye I
really want it to be kind of ombre like
the inner corner stock white and then it
fades like a platinum silver so using
that same 242 I'm going to begin to
press that on the outer corner of the
eye and I'm going to actually kind of
use it to clean up that cut crease so if
you were messy at all or you had any
fallout on your lid this is your time to
really kind of carve it and go back and
forth to make it nice and sharp again
I'm taking a little bit more of a
Nastasia deep Brown and that same morphe
5:07 brush i'm going to put a little bit
more just to make sure that it's nice
and sharp but yet still blended does
that make sense a sharp and blended you
got me you're keeping up so now we're
going in with Mac Pro emphasize this is
a highlighting powder and I'm going to
just put that in the inner corner of the
eye to really highlight I'm going to
dabble it a little bit over that inner
corner highlight that we have going on
I'm going to bring it all the way up so
it's kind of going towards the brow area
to make everything nice and soft and I'm
going to bring it underneath the eye
area about half way in on that lower
lash line I really wanted the inner
corner of my eye to pop and look very
icy so I'm just putting a lot of this
all over that inner rim but I didn't
want it to be too frosty that's why I
didn't go in with like Mac nylon I
wanted to still have kind of a matte
inner corner of the eye that's why I
chose that now for my brows I am using
Anastasia brow Wiz as always I'm so
excited for her new brow product to come
out have you guys seen her pencil yet on
her Instagram I'm like dying I'm so
excited to try it because I'm so die
hard for the brow is I love it so much
so I can't wait anything that she
develops for the brows I'm so fangirl
about it it's ridiculous now I'm gonna
be going in with house of lashes boudoir
eyelashes god I just love the name of
these lashes they're just so fun to say
I'm just gonna pop those on the upper
lash line as you see I did not apply any
liner go ahead and apply some liner if
you want you can do a wing you can do a
smoky liner you can do just a straight
line whatever you want but I didn't want
to apply any liner I wanted to keep this
look nice and simple and I'm going to go
back in with that same a Nastasia deep
Brown again and I'm going to pop that on
the lower lash line and I'm going to
keep that strictly on the outer corner
of my eye only I do not
bring it in and start getting that lower
lashline too smokey I want to really
keep that highlight nice and bright on
the inner corner and then using any
pencil brush I'm just going to buff it
out I did put a little bit of kid on my
pencil brush that would we have the
lighter color to buff it out because
it's hard to buff out a color not using
a lighter one so since I put the duct
one I pick up a little bit of a lighter
shade and I buff it out so it's nice and
blended and smokey only on the lower
half of the eye you'll see after I do
this step how much like my eyes are
going to look open and make them pop and
that's the point of this this look and
these steps I'm applying just a vanilla
liner it does not matter which one
because what I'm going to do next is I'm
going to go back with that exact same
white that we use on the eyes and a tiny
little precision brush you can use a
q-tip if you want I'm going to pop that
right on top of my waterline and
basically what it's going to do is it's
going to keep that waterline really
bright the entire day it'll also make it
so that it doesn't bleed it doesn't move
it doesn't fade and it's also going to
make our eyes pop way more if you just
have a stock white eyeliner you can use
that but I did not have that I ran out I
don't know where it went
I haven't had it in years so this is
what I did setting your liner with
powder and your waterline is a really
great way to make it last the entire day
doh
though if you guys have issues with it
moving and running so now for bronzer
I'm going to be using the hourglass
luminous bronze light my sister's the
one that introduced this bronzer to me
and it is so beautiful so I would highly
suggest it for those of you who are very
fair out there because my sister is very
very light like milky colored skin and
it looks gorgeous on her
I'm not gonna lie I'm very flustered by
how this showed up on camera it looks
blotchy it just doesn't look good it's
causing me stress but we're gonna move
past that okay move past it for blush
I'm gonna be going in with the balm
Argyle Argyle is the name of the blush
and it's just this beautiful matte
babydoll pink the balm has such great
blushes and I feel like no one ever
talks about them but they're so good
they're be honestly such a beautiful
formulas I love them then I'm going to
go over that with the Bobbi Brown
shimmer brick in the shade pink and I'm
going to put that right on the apples of
the cheeks because I personally would
have gone in with a light babydoll pink
lip which is what I exchanged it for
after I got done filming and pink cheeks
but I wanted to do something different
because I know a lot of you guys have
really been in
kind of dark purpley ma B Brown shades
recently but I really love a pink lip
with this look side note for the
highlight I'm using champagne pop and
pearl pearl is now permanent by Becca so
if you're interested in it you can
purchase it separately it is not just in
this palette anymore they just release
it which is super exciting because it's
such a beautiful unique really really
light highlight for those of you who are
super fair I'm also going to highlight
my Cupid's bow and then I'm going to set
my face using the Urban Decay chill
makeup setting spray and I wanted to do
this first before I apply these little
gems on the inner corner of my eyes that
way the Urban Decay makeup spray didn't
like wet in them and make them move or
slide around from the wetness of the
spray so I'm just going to use one of
these little rhinestones this is a pack
of like I don't know a thousand of these
little rhinestones I got it from Amazon
it was like $2.99 for this pack using
tweezers I'm literally just going to pop
it on the inner corner of my eye it's so
easy and if they don't have an adhesive
on the back just put a dot eyelash glue
on it wait 20 seconds and pop it on and
you're good to go
so easy you can put these all over your
lid to which will look gorgeous for the
lips I'm going to use color pops
stingray this was developed by it's my
ray-ray here on YouTube congratulations
girl it's beautiful I've had mixed
emotions about these colour-pop liquid
lips but this one is gorgeous it's
beautiful the formulas great the price
point is amazing so this is a really
really nice shade and I have been loving
it recently so once you have your lip on
you are good to go so I hope that you
enjoy this video you guys thank you so
much for watching I love you and I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
