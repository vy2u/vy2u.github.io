you
hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
a makeup tutorial for you I have pretty
much been wearing this look non-stop for
the past month any pictures or videos
that you've seen me in this is what's
happening I've gotten a lot of questions
and requests from you guys about this
look so I figured I'd make a video for
you it is a very warm toned look a lot
of mustard colors a lot of oranges a lot
of warm Browns peaches and that is very
on-trend right now and it will continue
to be on trend until spring 2014 and if
you've been watching me for the past
year then you know that this look is
right up my alley because I love warm
colors so hopefully this will give you
an idea of how to make it a little bit
more wearable so yeah I really hope you
guys enjoy and I'll talk to you soon bye
for those of you curious I did use the
new me titan-3
curling wand to curl my hair today and I
was not expecting it to be so big but
it's happening so I'm going with it I
look with a discount code for it and the
exact size of barrel that I use in the
description bar below bye
so my eyes are already primed and the
first thing I'm going to do is take this
color called toast
it is a Bobby brown eyeshadow i'm using
a sigma e40 brush to buff this in my
crease mainly focusing on the outer
corner and buffing upwards seamlessly so
that we have no lines if you're
wondering why the Farrell of this brush
is a copper color it is the new
extravaganza collection that I am using
at this moment then I'm going to go in
with champagne quartz this is another
bobbi brown eyeshadow and mention all of
these and my monthly favourites on how
much I've been loving them and with a
sigma e55 brush I'm going to Pat this
all over my lid mainly focusing on the
inner corner is when I where I want the
most pigment and I'm just going to kind
of dab it out to the outer corner of my
eye then I'm going in with the shade
camel this is a really pretty mustardy
yellowy very warm Brown and using an e25
brush this is just more precise I'm
going to just dust this in the outer
corner of my crease slowly and gently
working upward but with the most pigment
on this brush you want to keep it as low
as possible in that outer corner kind of
making a v-shape and then slowly working
up then I'm going to take makeup geek
chickadee which is this awesome yellowy
orange e shade I love it for blending
anything out and again on that fluffy
brush I'm just going to take a little
bit of this and I'm going to fluff it
upwards just to help warm it up and make
sure there's no lines then using a
makeup forever eyeshadow and number 162
this is a much darker version of
everything else we're using and it's got
a little bit of purple tones in it but
it's still in the warm family so using
any pencil brush I'm just dabbing this
in the outer corner and as you can see
sloppily kind of making a v-shape once
again and then using that exact same e25
brush just to blend it all out so as you
can see I'm now blending inward and
upward so I'm kind of dusting this into
the middle of my lid as well and then I
am going back and putting a little bit
more on that brush just to make it a
little bit darker in that outer crease
area then i'm going in with eyeliner i'm
not sure exactly what eyeliner i'm using
here it is gel and as you can see i'm
using a little bit of a different
technique than you may have seen me use
in my previous videos but I basically
just line out that liner starting with
that outer wing and then I just fill it
in just like when you're a little kid
coloring in a coloring book and you just
trace it out and build in the lines I
have just musing this
technique recently and it's really easy
and I really been liking it then I'm
using a velour lashes I'm not sure which
ones these are I think they're from a
Holiday Collection I will put that down
below then I'm using a new foundation
that I'm trying out this is by Dolce &amp;amp;
Gabbana it's called the perfect luminous
liquid foundation and when I put it on
its not gonna look it matches me I know
but as you can see it matches the rest
of my body perfectly my face is much
much lighter than the rest of my body
even when I don't fake tan it's much
lighter it's just how it is from washing
and exploding my face all the time so
using an m-80 kabuki brush from Sigma
I'm just buffing this in all over the
skin other than the under eye area
that's where I'm going to put this NARS
concealer this is the radiant creamy
concealer creamy reading concealer you
know what I'm talking about then I'm
using another kabuki brush by Sigma I
don't remember the name of this I never
do I'm so sorry I'll list it down below
and I'm just using this to buff out my
concealer I love this because I feel
like it takes away any amount of
concealer that shouldn't be there and it
just makes it perfect I've been using
this brush everyday for concealer then
I'm setting my under eye concealer by
just dusting a little bit of powder not
too much or it can do the opposite and
make it look crepey just to set it then
I'm going to use makeup forever bronzing
powder this is in number 20 and I am
using my NARS Ida brush a brush ITA
brush still know how to pronounce that
one and I'm just going to contour my
cheeks I will put my contouring video
down below my description bar along with
my false eyelash video and my eyebrow
video for you if you want to see any of
those things in depth but I'm just
contouring and then I'm going in with
this Marc Jacobs brush I know don't
judge me it was tempting me so much in
Sephora and I gave him but it's
amazeballs to blend out bronzer
then I'm using NARS Gilda blush which is
a matte color that I absolutely love is
the perfect amount of peach and pink and
rose all put together and I'm just going
to buff that all the cheek area working
straight back we're blending it into the
bronzer then I'm taking the Laura
Mercier baked highlighter and 0/1 with
this random fan brush that I've never
seen in my life and I have no idea where
it came from and I swear it looks like
it's from an art supply store but all my
other brushes were dirty and it was
sitting there so hey I'm just
highlighting the cheeks in the chin in
the upper
you know how that goes then I am filling
in my brows the same way I always do
with Anastasia brow is in the shade soft
brown I will put that video below for an
in-depth tutorial on that then using the
bare minerals original foundation and
this brush from Real Techniques I'm
going to dust the slightest tiniest
amount of powder just to set that t-zone
then using Anastasia clear brow gel I'm
just going to set my brows otherwise
they will be cray cray and all over the
place this will just make sure they
don't move or flap around in the wind
then I'm going to use Mac shroom as you
can see I love it it's down to the pan
once again I've probably gone through 10
of these in my lifetime any Sigma
concealer brush so random but I actually
just picked this up one day when none of
my brushes were clean and now I use it
every day for my under eye highlights I
love it so much then I'm going to take
any pencil brush and dust that same
color of toast underneath the eye area
just from all the way from outer corner
to inner corner I always start with a
lighter shade then taking a more precise
brush I'm going to take that same makeup
for ever color and keep that more just
on the outer corner and lightly blend it
in words but mainly on that outer corner
then I'm going in with camel that
mustardy Brown again and I'm just going
to rush that everywhere back and forth
and this will just give you that really
smoked out under eyes soft feeling and
as you can see there's more depth in the
outer corners in the inner which I
personally prefer using shroom and this
brush that I honestly don't know the
name of but once again I'll put it below
it's from Sigma I'm going to highlight
my inner corner and then use Rimmel lash
accelerator mascara to coat my bottom
lashes with mascara this is always an
absolute must for me even if you have
tiny little ashes you don't think they
exist I always think this makes a
difference on anybody then I'm going to
go in with my two favorite lime crime
lipsticks the first one is BAE bet which
you can see right here how beautiful it
is oh I love it it is the perfect pink
with just the right amount of peach and
I have been obsessed with this lipstick
and then over top I'm going to put Cosmo
pop which is very orange I'm going to
focus that mainly on the center of my
lips and then lightly kind of buff it
out to the rest and then
smack my lips together just to make it
look like this perfect peachy orange
shade that I love and it just
complements everything it ties the eyes
and the cheeks all together then using
Urban Decay gel makeup setting spray I'm
going to douse myself basically take a
shower so that everything will not move
and I will look nice and dewy because we
know it's wintertime and I am dry so I
hope you guys enjoy I love you so much
I'll see you soon bye
I can't think I just want to eat my taco
tenda hala so I know my hair is huge
right now seriously looks like barf
ba-bow Oh
brand-new brushes so now I just don't
know what to do with my hair
Deepu oh no no that's because he's not
eating
hey guys so today and I really hope you
enjoy the video and I'll see you soon
bye
