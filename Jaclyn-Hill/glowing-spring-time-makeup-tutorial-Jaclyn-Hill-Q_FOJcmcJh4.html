learn to pronunciate oh my god and get
on my nails are the same color as my
shirt what why do you have to be so
bitchy stop judging me call me okay oh
god my hair looks bad I can't look at
myself so I did this daytime look um
easy neutral colors you can do it with
or without eyeliner you can simplify it
a little bit if you want to um I think
that it's a daytime look that I wear
during the day you can easily wear it at
night you can throw on some lashes or
just make your eyeliner thicker um yeah
it's very fresh it's very dewy and glowy
I think it's springtime even though
there's not like pops of pink that
doesn't necessarily mean spring to me
when I think of spring makeup
I think of minimal makeup that's very
fresh ladylike with corals and pinks and
neutrals and just glowing
Here I am no makeup hating life okay we
get it
so I'm priming my face with Smashbox
photo-finish and I'm really loving this
primer lately and then I'm moisturizing
my lips with yo s lip balm because it
just smells and tastes so yummy
I'm using Mac's face and body foundation
today and this is such a different
foundation from anything else I've ever
used before it's so thin and it's so
hydrating it's like 75 percent water I
think or 80 percent water so you can put
on layers and layers and layers and it
never gets cakey now as you can see I'm
using a synthetic brush to apply this
and the reason why I'm doing that is
because this foundation has so much
water in it you don't want to use a
natural brush natural hair usually comes
from the belly of a goat no they are not
hurt so don't be sad but when it's a
natural hair you think of it as a hair
in your head and if you were to put
water on your hair and then try to take
that and put it on skin it wouldn't work
because your hair would absorb all the
water so therefore I am using a
synthetic brush it's fake hair so it's
not going to hold the product it's just
going to put its shirt on my skin so now
I'm spraying fix+
directly on the brush to do another
layer of foundation because like I said
it's so thin that you can put on like
three to five layers and you're still
going to look natural I'm you doing this
because it's going to make my skin look
really dewy and glowy which is what I
want because that's what I like my face
to look like in the springtime
especially since my skin is so dry right
now this is really nice now I'm putting
select cover up in nw20 on my eyelids
only and I'm using this as a primer I
know everybody uses Paint Pots and
primer potions but I use concealer I
think that it works the best for me it
gets rid of all my discoloration and
veins and it just gives me a really nice
even toned canvas to work with
I like this bar than anything else now
I'm taking nw15 umm concealer from mac
which is the new mineral concealer nw15
is quite a few shades lighter than me if
you can see and I'm doing the V where
I'm going down side my nose and then up
to the top my cheekbone and I'm going to
just emphasize that V with this brush
and then I'm going to go in with my
fingers and blend it out because I think
that gives you the best blending over
any brush I like to use my fingers for a
lot of things and makeup over brushes
because I really like the warmth of your
fingertips on your skin
it'll emulsify it and basically just
make it look a lot more natural I'm
continuing to blend but I'm going to
keep it in that v-shape I don't want to
go down too far on my cheekbones I don't
want to go up on the sides of my nose
okay I'm filling in my eyebrows pretty
basic I'm using lingering brow pencil by
Mac um nothing special I'm not going to
bring the color in up all the way and in
all the way and all that jazz I'm just
like filling out the wing and just
little tiny sparse hairs in the inner
corner and then I'll just fluff it out
with the spool because I think that
really makes looking actual I'm using
dazzle light by Mac to put a highlight
underneath my brow then I'm gonna take
soft brown which is a shade that
everybody should own and I'm going to
just buff that and my upper crease as
you can see and it's across the lid and
once you lie promotion this isn't going
to be deep down on the lid really as
more an upper crease and up towards that
highlight color it's just such a
beautiful color it's so easy to blend
you can just take it out to your brow I
love it and as you can see it blends so
beautifully but that's also a lot of
credit to the brush because the 224
brush by Mac is just fabulous I'm taking
fascinating.i Kohl and just lining the
inner part of my eye because now I'm
going back in with that same dazzle
light color that I used under my brow to
highlight my inner corners and that
fascinating I call isn't necessary but
it will have a pop I'm taking the shade
texture which I did not show you guys
I'm sorry
very very lightly and I'm just pushing
it down all of my lid I'm using the 217
brush because I don't want it to be
intense I want it to be really light and
the 217 will really buff it out
beautifully as opposed to packing on the
color and I'm taking that same texture
color along with soft brown mixed
together and I'm just rubbing it under
my eyes then I'm taking that same 217
it's rubbing it all along to feather out
now typographic is the name of this next
show
by Mac and I am taking it on a natural
hair brush and the reason I'm using a
natural hair is because I want this to
go on really lightly and not densely and
not thick so instead of packing it on
I'm using two natural hairs I'm going to
use the first one and now this 217 you
see and I'm going to use this to just
lightly touch it on now if I were you
use a synthetic hair it would put all
the products on my lid like my
foundation brush did but since this is a
natural hair it's holding on to some of
that product so that it's not really
thick this is a great brush for people
who are just starting out and make up in
our scared of color because it's going
to put everything on really lightly I
think this is one of the first brushes I
ever owned by Mac and also people who
are more mature and older and age they
usually like this brush as well because
you know if you're using like a shimmery
color it's not going to put on as much
shimmer is more of just a light wash of
color I'm curling my eyelashes now not
anything special but I was having a
horrible eyelash day where they were all
over the place and I was not okay with
that but I'm using black track now which
is a gel liner but I love I cannot live
without you and I'm doing just a really
thin line well then in my opinion I'm
just really tight across my lash line at
the very top I'm not doing anything
special I'm not winging it out it's not
going to be thick or you know bolder on
the edges just nice and tight against my
lashes and I'm doing this just because I
like the way it looks with the black and
then the gray and then the light soft
Brown I just think it's a really
beautiful gradient right there and as
you can see I'm taking a little bit more
that type of graphic and just dabbing it
on the outer edges just to soften up
that line even more on the edge um I
just think it looks really pretty like
that I just like how soft it is now I'm
taking Mac's prep and prime eye
highlighter and this is in radiant rose
and I'm gonna like streak it like a
zebra all over underneath my eye area
where I did with my concealer and I'm
doing this last because if there's any
fallout from anything it's gonna clean
it up and I'm just sweeping it all
across that area it's really thin it's
not going to add much color or anything
I just do this just because I add the
highway
and with a look like this for spring I
really enjoy this under-eye highlight
just because I think it makes you look
really fresh and awake and alive but it
has to be done right otherwise it can be
like raccoon eyes to the max kind of
scary not a big deal I'm taking crystal
avalanche which is a bright white color
and I'm just going to dab it in my
waterline just because I don't want to
use an eye Kohl on the eyeliner because
I feel like it's starch white and it can
look like it's too much it doesn't look
like your everyday woman it looks like
you're a makeup artist and I want this
look to be a little bit more on the
natural side so I use eyeliner
I mean eyeshadow instead I think it
looks much more natural and it doesn't
irritate my eyes as much and it just
gets rid of that reddish pink tone in
there because I don't want that tone in
my waterline with the neutrals that I
have going on but that's just me being
like crazy and now I'm adding mascara
this mascara is getting to the very end
so it's not doing its job as well as it
used to it's really sad but just
remember when you're applying your
mascara to tease your eyelashes just
like you tease your hair when you want
volume so if you can see I kind of tease
it at the root and then zigzag it down
you'll get oh you'll get much much
better results if you do this over just
grabbing your mascara wand and just
going straight up and down over and over
your lashes will really grab onto the
mascara this way okay it's time to do my
face I am using something special which
is a cream blend blush by Mac and I'm
putting that on the apple of my cheeks
and dragging it up just a little bit now
cream blush has come a long way it's not
your grandmother's blush anymore
it is amazing now and Mac has come out
with a new technology that is just
gorgeous so don't be afraid of it
because it is my obsession for spring
well it's my session last year - I'm
taking a light powder um it's actually
the eye shadow vanilla by Mac and I'm
tapping it right there on the outer
edges just to get even more of that
highlight but I'm not using shimmer
colors up there
I'm staying with matte velvety colors
because I don't want to be super frosty
I'm taking a medium dark mineral powder
and just
finding the side of my forehead and then
this lipstick is cream cup and I am just
putting on a lipstick like a normal
human being
nothing special feeling awkward yes
I'm ending it off by spraying fix+ all
over my face generously and just letting
it sit and soak in and you are all done
