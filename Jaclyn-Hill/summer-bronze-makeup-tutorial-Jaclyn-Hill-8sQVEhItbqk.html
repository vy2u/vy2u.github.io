on Instagram yesterday asking you guys
if you wanted to see a bronzed summery
look in a lot of you said yes so I am
here giving you what you want and this
look incorporates golds and browns I'm
using a different technique today than I
normally do where I do like the light
shade on the lid and then the darker one
in the crease this is a little bit
different um this will make your eyes
look on the rounder side and it'll
really make your eyes pop and stand out
on no matter what color your eyes are
brown blue green it does not matter this
look is gonna make your eyes stand out
just because of the shape and the colors
that we're using the gold being in the
center and the brown on the inner and
outer is really gonna make your eyes
stand out so I hope you guys enjoyed let
me know if you try it let me know if you
like it you obviously do not have to use
the same products that I am using
use whatever you have at home it doesn't
matter you know just as long as you have
browns and golds you can follow along so
I hope you enjoy I hope you really like
this on yourself and I hope you're
having a good summer alright bye guys so
the first thing I'm doing is taking soft
brown and Samoas silk I'm gonna take
these and mix them together because soft
Brown I felt like was a little too pink
and Samoa silk was a little too yellow
but they're both great transitional
colors for the crease so I'm just mixing
them together and I'm going to put them
in my crease and I'm gonna put a pretty
good amount in my crease area as you can
see I'm doing just as generous of an
amount on the inner corner as I am on
the outer you don't want to focus this
anywhere in particular just all over the
top from outer corner to inner lid but
I'm going back and forth and you can go
back and continue to pick up more until
you feel like you've got the right color
and the right amount that you're going
for but just make sure that you get that
shape where you're not just focusing on
the outer corner since we're going to be
putting darker shades in the inner
corner as well and then next I'm gonna
go in with amber lights this is such a
pretty gold color it's beautiful and so
I'm just going to take this I'm going to
pack it in the center of my eyelid I'm
not going to bring it all the way into
the inner corner or the outer corner um
if you if you're a little messy with it
it's not a big deal just make sure that
the main pigment of it is in the very
center of your eyelid but it doesn't
matter because we're going to go in with
saddle next and we're going to blend
this all over the place so this is a
shot of saddle right there and I'm going
to take a fluffy blending brush and I'm
just going to start dabbing this on my
outer corner and I have my brush held
sideways just for now just to get the
depth in there and just the shape and
I'm just gonna bring that sideways into
the inner corner and just pack it in
there and I'm going back and forth back
and forth and with this look I like to
continuously dip my brush into the shade
I don't like to just sit there with tons
of that product on my brush and just try
to go into all at once
I'm continuously going back and dabbing
a little bit dabbing a little bit and
now I'm blending upward as you can see
I've turned my brush a different way now
to kind of get it higher and more
blended out and I'll let you watch me do
it again to the other eye so you can
understand this technique and you know
just dab dab dab on the outer corner and
then keep your brush sideways going over
top of that amber lights and I apologize
for I have a little piece of like brush
hair stuck in my eyebrow and it looks
like I have like white hair oh god not
yet whatever anyways so back to what I'm
doing in that brush and I'm making sure
that I get just as much pigment in that
inner corner as I am in the outer corner
we want this to all be even so it's dark
brown gold and then dark brown again and
we're giving this a round shape to
really emphasize the eyes now next I'm
going to take that same flat shader
brush and I'm going to spritz it with
fix+
and you can see a really quick shot at
me right there spritzing it with the
Kardashians playing in the background
sorry and then I'm going to dab it back
into amber lights and just dab dab dab
of my lid and this is going to give it
like almost a metallic sheen so that
goal will really pop and glow you do not
have to use fix+
you can use water you can use your spit
for all I care but if your brush is wet
it's gonna work I'm gonna be really
gross use your spit but you know to each
their own you do what you got to do and
now I'm putting on my eyeliner nothing
new I've thought about cutting out me
doing my eyeliner completely in these
videos because it is what it is I'm just
putting on my eyeliner and I'm doing a
little wing as normal and I do change up
my eyeliner sometimes but in my
tutorials I really haven't showed you
guys a variety of it and I'm doing just
a thin line and this one needs like semi
thin semi-thick whatever you know what
I'm talking about and I'm going in with
my foundation and I know I've said this
before but my foundation does not look
this yellow in person for some reason my
camera it's just really driving me crazy
it's become like a very big pet peeve of
mine I hate looking at myself I'm doing
my foundation in part in my skin it's
freaking out because of some medication
that I'm on so it's not too cute right
now but that's okay it happens now I'm
going in with my concealer and today I'm
not using a concealer that's a lot
lighter than my skin tone I'm using one
that pretty much matches me perfectly
and I'm doing this just because we're
doing a bronze look so I don't want to
do a light under-eye area I want it to
be the same color because I want to have
that bronze golden tan glow so therefore
I don't want that whiteness on my face
so I'm just dabbing this under my eyes
and I'm also going to use it to help
clean up the eye shadow on that has
fallen down on the edges umm yeah and
I'm just using my finger and just
patting that in and then when I get to
my corner I just kind of like dab it
right next to my eyeliner to make sure
that it covers that whole area see you
look at me go okay
then I'm going to fill in my eyebrows
I'm using cork by Mac brush and I've
gotten a lot of questions from people
about using eyeshadow for my eyebrows
and honestly I like using eyeshadow
better than pencil because I think the
pencil can make them look too harsh if
you think about it you're used to doing
your eyeliner with pencil
usually do a thick line eye shadow is I
think easier to just blend out and make
your eyebrows look a little bit more
natural and I'm taking that same amber
lights gold color and I'm putting it on
my lower lash line and I'm concentrating
it on the center of my eye but it
doesn't matter you can put it wherever
and I'm going to take saddle just like
the top and I'm going to put on my outer
corner and again on my inner corner and
you can see how I'm just taking this I'm
switching brushes up for no particular
reason don't mind me and then I'm going
in with this brush it has a little bit
of Samoas silk on it and I'm just
buffing so that at the bottom I don't
have any harsh lines you can see how
it's helped blending that out I just
want to eliminate any harshness I would
have anywhere on my eyes because I want
this all to just be very buffed out and
really have no lines but that's how I
feel about everything I say that every
single time don't I ah now I'm putting
on lashes nothing new lashes and then
I'm going to go in with mascara which by
the way I'm deciding to do lashes for
this look because I took my eye shadow
up really high and it was just gonna
look weird without it you cannot do this
so dramatic and you will not need lashes
this could easily be just a very casual
makeup look but I'm making it a little
bit more dramatic showing you guys all
your options now I'm highlighting my
inner corner with a Goldy champagne
color I don't want to do anything silver
for this look because we're sticking
with the bronze and then I'm going to
take give me Sun by Mac and I'm going to
bronze my face I'm not contouring I'm
just taking this big brush and I'm
bronzing under my cheekbones up around
my temples and forehead under your
jawline wherever you feel it's necessary
and you can just do this but that wasn't
enough for me so I'm going in with
orgasm by NARS and this is the most
amazing blush if you want that summer
glow I mean obviously everybody and
their mother is obsessed with it but is
amazing so after that I'm going to take
um albatross again by NARS which is a
highlighter shade and I'm going to take
it and I'm going to go right above that
blush and bring it down just a little
bit
on top of it and that's what I'm doing
right here and I'm just going to drag it
down a little bit orgasm already has
some gold shimmer in it so this is just
going to help tie that all together and
help us out with that bronze look now
I'm just taking this l'oreal eyeliner
intense and i'm just covering up that
glue because it didn't dry like I wanted
it to it was kind of like crusty and
that's just not cute so yeah I'm
covering that up and then after that I'm
gonna take a fluffy brush with more
Samoas silk on it and I'm going to just
buff that under my eyes so once again
help blend everything out because I
don't want any lines in this look now
I'm taking Flor abundance lip gloss by
Mac and I'm putting this all over my
lips I'm using a gloss instead of a
lipstick because gloss is more summery
it's more laid-back it's gonna make your
lips look more full and pouty and I
don't want a structured lip I just want
gloss and then I'm going to throw some
mascara on my bottom eyelashes you don't
have to do this I am choosing to because
I just felt incomplete now I'm going to
take that same amber lights color and I
with a brush and I'm just dabbing it on
my waterline it would be idealistic to
use an eyeliner but I don't have one in
the shaded time so I am just gonna use
this instead after that your look is
complete thank you so much for watching
and have a great day in summer fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
