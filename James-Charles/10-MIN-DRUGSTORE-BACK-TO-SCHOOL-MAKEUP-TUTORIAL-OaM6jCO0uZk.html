welcome back to my youtube channel so if
you guys follow me on snapchat which if
you don't you definitely should you see
that I posted if you need to go about
redoing my entire camera setup I
actually did snap that I wasn't gonna be
posting at all this week because I'm in
the middle of redoing everything from
lighting camera lenses graphics and
everything on this channel I am so
excited now they have so many cool
things and ideas and concepts in the
works and you guys will be seeing them
very very soon but people are like I'll
just film James we don't care and I know
you guys are always so supportive
between the world to me so you know I
got my booty down and we're going to
film today so if you check your calendar
it is officially August which is
absolutely horrifying because summer is
coming to a screeching halt and you know
what comes at the end of summer school
as many of you guys know I did graduate
early and I don't plan on attending
college so thank Lord in heaven above I
will not be in timing school this year
but I know so many of you will and I
myself did for 17 very very long years
so for today's to do i sat down and
we're going to film a back-to-school
quick and easy makeup tutorial
almost all the products I have in front
of me today are Shura the surfer those
knees were on a budget I see your girl
makeup can be super expensive when I was
in school four years ago lord knows I
did not have for did you dollar spent on
a new foundation that was going towards
the new textbook school is also super
time-consuming as well I know I had so
many nights staying up until 4:00 or
5:00 a.m. editing videos or working on a
test or a paper or a project that I had
to wake up an hour later and get to
school so this video is also going to be
a little bit of a challenge today where
I want to do this makeup look as quickly
as I possibly can
I was going to limit myself to ten
minutes but knowing me let's be real
it's not to take a little bit longer so
I'm just going to do this pretty pretty
quickly there's going to be a super easy
light makeup routine that you guys can
use when you are waking up late ten
minutes before your bus gets here
because we've all had those days with
all that being said good morning sisters
I hope you guys enjoy your day in hell I
mean school today and without further
ado let's get started on this super easy
everyday school makeup routine
all right they're already went ahead and
prep my skin it by showering of course
in the morning don't want to be stinky
for school and then I probably face
using my favorite moisturizer for
foundations today I'm going to use a
brand new covergirl healthy elixir
foundation and I'm going to mix a shade
725 and 745 then of course I'm just
going to bounce it into my skin using my
damp Beauty Blender and all that needs
to not happen so this foundation is
definitely a light to medium coverage
foundation is definitely not full
coverage glam which is great though we
definitely don't need to be rocking a
full coverage HD foundation stick to
high school it's really not that serious
we don't have anybody to impress so
don't worry about it you can see my face
today using the Maybelline fit me
concealer in the shade and light there's
one thing that we do definitely focus on
it is probably going to be concealer
just actually really hide any blemishes
or under-eye bags because I'm like I
said we are definitely to be up very
very late working on papers and projects
and not getting very much sleep in
school I've been there before so let's
do everything we can to fix it and once
again just have my Beauty Blender and
I'm going to pounce it into place Kouga
deftly be super super stressful as well
and we have all woken up with just a
loose before and stress breakout so if
you do get one never fear
don't worry just grab your favorite
concealer to put it over your pimple
just the slightest bit and then instead
of using a Beauty Blender I'm actually
going to have a very really light fluffy
brush and instead of counting and I'm
just going to lightly tap over the area
and just blend out those edges by doing
this we're keeping the concealer exactly
where you want it to be right over the
pimple obviously so it's hidden and then
just blending out those edges so it
looks natural okay so my face in place
today I could even be Cody or some
powder you guys know I definitely have a
very very interesting cancer with this
one but it wasn't oldie but a goodie for
the longest time so I'm going to try her
again today hopefully she won't do we
dirty I'm just gonna grab a little bit
of powder really lightly on my r-13
brush from morphe and just set my under
eyes in place that understood my ar0
brush once again from morphe to set the
rest my face I know more P's obviously
not a drugstore brand that is sold in
like CVS or Walgreens or anything but
their products are super super cheap
compared to a lot of their competitors
and they are very very good as well and
you guys know you can use coach James
for 10% off all their products to
highlight and bronze today I got to go
to my next highlight and contour palette
and my morphe m5 on 9 brush and I'm
different to the shade right up in here
and I'm just going to lightly bronze and
contour my face because look
real we definitely don't have time to do
both I'm next underground the same exact
nor p.m. 509 brush that I use for the
contour and I'm going to dip into the
elf blush palette and I'm going to use
this shader brighten up in this corner
right here for just a little bit of
orange pop of color to the face just add
a little bit of light back in so next
one are really good we played the brows
today and for this I'm actually using a
not drugstore product and I'm going to
be using the benefit processor eyebrow
pencil in the shade number three but I
am this for a very very good reason so
if you guys are we talking about on
Instagram a few days ago I had a very
very exciting announces that I posted
about and that is that I am teaming up
with Benefit Cosmetics well my favorite
brands in the entire world to work on a
very very new and exciting project that
I am literally so pumped for I haven't
actually talked to us on YouTube yet
though so hello hi get ready because I'm
going to be one of your four influencer
coaches for the benefit browser search
benefit is basically holding a
competition to find it they're brand new
Bravo so basically once all the entries
get narrowed down 20 people are going to
win a trip to Lake Tahoe here in
California where you guys are going to
be basically going to a brow boot camp
and all 20 contestants will be split
between the four judges so five you guys
will be on hashtag team sisters and of
course we're going to it because you
guys know sister James never loses a
good competition I love my escape rooms
I love competing in general so we
definitely have a very very solid tan I
also forgot to mention as well it's
really not that important though but the
grand prize winner will be winning only
$50,000 if you're interested in the
benefit bro search and you want to be on
hashtag team sisters make sure to check
the description box down below because
I'll put a link where you can check out
the full information and details on how
to enter
good luck all right so I just went ahead
and I quickly said my other brow off
camera we're already getting close to 10
minutes I definitely to speed this up a
little bit because we're going to be
late for first period I'm not going to
do any eyeshadow for this lip today
let's be real if we're getting up 10
minutes before the bus gets here the
last thing we have time to do is a
freaking smoky eye or some like halo eye
or some type of fancy I look so I am
gonna go to the wet and wild
liquid liner though and just do a quick
little line I'm keeping this liner super
super thin and hugging the lash line
very very tightly
I'm not going to doing a dramatic wing
today and I'm also not going to wearing
falsies this is just going to help out a
little bit more volume to lashes when it
comes to adding masks
just a super super simple thin easy line
if you want to be brave into a wing
be my guest girl play that wing get
ready to cut those bitches from the
other end of the biology room at
Bellevue in fourth period we've all been
there
we're definitely not to be messing this
Balthus today nobody has time for glue
and lashes in the morning not me I'll
tell you that right now they're gonna be
focusing a little bit more on my lashes
to prep them for mascara I'm just going
to curl them quickly then for mascara
today I'm gonna be using the new L'Oreal
voluminous last paradise you guys know
I'm a writer down for the benefit roller
lash
but that $31 is another textbook so
we're gonna have to go drugstores today
oh my god I actually really like how
this mascara applies for highlighter
today I'm going to use the brand new one
Wild mega glow in the shade golden
flower crown out of this entire makeup
routine I feel like highlighters by far
the most important part of it not only
we look like a beautiful glazed donut
walking through the halls but also when
your teacher comes up to and it's like
do you have last night's homework and
you know damn well you were up until
4:00 I am watching makeup tutorials you
can be like bad and she'll be so shocked
and blinded that she won't even remember
her question never underestimate the
power of a good glow sisters either last
but not least for the lipid is udon
today I'm going to go to these soft
matte lip cream from NYX in the shade
London my best friend sister Laura
swears they're these two words and every
single day all day long and I love them
as well so definitely a very very easy
lipstick to carry on the go to school
and that's what finally not leads to set
our face in place for eight hours of
Hell sorry again I mean school I'm going
on my morphe husband settings right and
I'm just going to post my entire face
alright guys so this is a super easy and
quick back-to-school glam makeup stroke
all completed let's go ahead and
actually stop the timer and we are at 12
minutes and 52 seconds ooh not bad at
all actually definitely not the ten
minutes I was anticipating for those two
minutes and 52 seconds can definitely
make a huge difference in the morning
but also not bad at all

excited and definitely may comment down
