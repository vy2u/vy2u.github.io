welcome back to our YouTube channel as
you guys didn't see we're not in the
normal makeup studio and for today's
video we were doing a super super fine
makeup challenge
I am literally so pumped for this but
also a little bit nervous I'm not gonna
lie if he makes ago I saw my good-ass
sister nikita dragon do video where she
got ready and Sephora using all tests or
makeup and forties I'm gonna recreate
that video by nikita but we're gonna try
to do it under 30 minutes
I feel like 30 is a pretty good number
for this video being that the average
person probably sends around 20 minutes
on their everyday makeup routine and for
a special event they may take a little
bit more time also for me my average
makeup routine takes me around 2 hours
so 30 bits is definitely a huge major
challenge we also have to take into
consideration that every Sephora is
different and the layouts are all
different so a lot of that time is
probably gonna be spent finding my
shades and finding the products in
general I'm gonna be getting ready today
using all the makeup in Sephora
including their spooky lighting and
mirrors but I did pick out a few things
that I wanted to bring here from home
starting off with a damp Beauty sponge
to blend in my foundation
I've brushes that I felt like I could
not do a makeup routine without being a
contour brush that I'm also gonna use
for brush lush hello in powder a nose
contouring brush a a flat tub concealer
brush a highlighting brush and then a
pencil brush and finally I also grabbed
a pair of lashes these are the new
bouncing Bellas obviously being a makeup
source Sephora does sell all the items
that I'm gonna be bringing with me today
but first of all that's kind of really
unsanitary I'm definitely not trying to
get any size or disease or infections
spooked and to all the sampled makeup
that we're gonna be using it's like out
and open to the public to you but all
these items are prepackaged
and that folks is what we like to call
stealing and for me personally I'm
trying to get a house and a boyfriend
not a lawsuit and jail time without
further ado it let's call our uber by
the way you can use code sister James
for five dollars off your first three
Birds I don't know if I've ever actually
mentioned that in a YouTube video but
you're welcome
beebeep ahead at let's get started with
the Sephora makeup challenge
all right guys we have arrived here at
the poor end of this challenge is ready
to go I'm gonna set the timer for 30
minutes guys I'm a little bit spooked
I'm gonna try my best to clean all the
products of for use and then because it
can sometimes be a very very unsanitary
but we're definitely gonna get a full
clan maple work done
fingers crossed at least in under 30
minutes I have my timer right here ready
to go we're gonna set this baby for 30
minutes exactly on the clock okay we're
ready to go so we have to start other
way just prime our face so I'm gonna go
for the tachi area wherever that is and
that's gonna be in skincare so we're
running running running running so we
got her brush it's dr. Brandt
oh it's touching not in this before I'm
scared way boccia Origen believe it or
not I missed the flora BAM okay
sorting off water cream primer you guys
know this is my all time babe I always
got to moisturize the face before
starting on my makeup routine really
good really fresh and then of the new
touches silk canvas primer as well as a
whopping $52 hello
Tata getting real brave with their
prices God what I love you the most this
primer is so bomb honestly one of the
only good primers that I've ever tried
that actually makes a difference I'm
gonna put this right on the face makeup
challenge I need a mirror I forgot how
spooky that sephora lighting a
foundation let's go
we need the to pay for this a foundation
you guys know that's my all-time Holy
Grail faith and they do carry to face
level two in Sephora I think my shade is
warm I know my not spray tan shade is
warm nude but I'm still spray tan from
Coachella okay I'm just gonna go with it
you know what go big go home this may be
a flat second married type of day a but
better be safe than sorry
I know this one that matches me so we're
gonna make it work what am I now have my
damp Beauty Blender so you guys know
that is only talk about my tips and
tricks to getting a perfect SCANA when
you're doing your base makeup and the
one trick that I talked about was when
you're shopping for foundation you
should always go outside and look at
your shade range with a mirror before
you actually put it on and buy in the
store because the lighting in support is
all obviously whoever said life and
outside lighting is obviously where you
want to make sure your foundation really
really notches but we did not have time
for foundation check today so I'm just
going to blend this in all over my face
so lowered anymore I don't have enough
coverage don't like almost care can't
forget to get the neck if this
foundation doesn't match that's gonna be
the one stayed in grace to hide it if
blend it all the way down I am wearing a
sisters apparel hoodie said I so oh wait
it's on the front
this is so hard don't forget to check
almost out for your cute sisters beer
every couple in the ears as well okay I
don't even have time we need to move on
to concealer welcome to Taiwan ease oh
my god shape is until the Sephora okay
Urban Decay all nighter here she is okay
oh wait
or the NARS radiant creamy concealer to
do ah where's nurse oh no oh no oh no no

urban decay true face buxom where did
NARS go I know we saw NARS hello I don't
have time for this we're going with the
Urban Decay Naked skin because I live it
cannot find the other concealer so
that's great that's too late oh my god
okay this is in the shade light warm
it's too yellow oh my god you've got to
be kidding me
light neutral let's try this again my
phone is ringing don't even know who it
is Ari then they'll make up challenge
gonna put in all the high points my face
center of the forehead or right down at
the bridge of the nose over the massage
area I did shave before this video if
shaving is part of the challenge we'd be
here for an extra hour thing called my
Beauty Blender sometimes just say we're
on the uber right over here because if
this was dry we it would be screwed to
the next level
oh my god using this concealer really
reminds me how much I need a tape tape
in my life why does that mean old Texaco
said they really played us good to that
one go I thought I literally have two
steps down I'm scared my skin looks
horrible okay whatever we need laura
mercier chances better now I'm holding
my eyes open so I don't get creases for
mercy oh here she is hello this is not
good
these are empty we're gonna try this I
don't know what this is Laura Mercier

okay let's try this blend in the creases
oh my god this looks horrible I guess
I'm just gonna dip my Beauty Blender

fates beat peach powder

time for that okay next week to chisel
out and bronze our face so we're going
well miss Kat Von D shade + light you
guys know I must to sir Stan I've been
using that damn shade light house as I
started a new makeup it looks busted and
crunch oh hello this is 30 what mine
looks like kind of to the time using a
morphe amplified brush and not slow to
Sephora but use Co James for 10% off the
lighting in here is literally the worst
I'm scared that's harsh ha we said we
were contour sisters today
Joline we have to be a sister snatched
right at that forehead a fool the gals
into thinking you have a forehead
instead of a five head really snatch it
up good I have blush on this brush
before her brought light here for
contouring and I'm very scared that I'm
looking probably a little bit pain oh my
god we only have 18 minutes five well
how has it already been 12 minutes you
have gotta be kidding me kind of chisel
out the nose my nose contour is mine
what was Plato's out tomato routine I
don't care how long I make up challenges
I am getting a notes contra in there
even if it takes me the entire time
y'all thought I was playing what brand
has setting sprays here let's see um oh
okay perfect so we have all nighter I'm
not ready to really set my face yet but
you know what we're just gonna give like
a dewy right we need to highlight let's
find Anasazi of Beverly Hills I know
she's here okay we have the glow kits
here you guys know my all computers on a
South ESL Hollywood but they actually
don't sell those in stores anymore which
is so rude I don't know what miss laura
mercier was doing with that setting
powder but she was not the T of my face
is creasing so bad
who's Karen we need to blend this in
okay let's do nose highlight same is our
product over here my face looks bad I'm
really scary I need more translucent
setting powder what brand has a loose
setting powder I need to bake my face oh
here's the NARS counter Wow gray Oh
cover fax yeah okay it looks like
there's some powder oh great we found
powder we found how do we thumb how do
we con powder goodness add some of this
up real quick my being able to respect
at the bottom of my thing haha they're
kidding me I need to bake my face
because this looks horrible right now
that's white I'm scared okay for baking
oh my god I'm dropping things okay it's
time for brows and I'm very scared
because I feel like if anything a brows
are gonna be the very very long process
perfect benefit from sin eyebrow number
four let's go over here I can usually do
my makeup routine actually you know what
maybe I should use the goof proof brow
pencil instead okay
crafts op we're using the benefit
precisely or hello benefit group we
don't even have my shade using the
benefit group to prep pencil number five
to snatch my brows up really quickly I
normally hate these shaper brow pencils
but it's much bigger and we really don't
have a lot of time left so I need to
cover the whole sign or brow face in the
short amount of time possible
additionally knees and like normal
starting at the bottom of the brow using
weights sure
Oh No you're kidding hello
that's the worst I brought hours into
entire life what's going on I'm scared
of the eyebrow okay you know what we do
have a concealer brush so we're gonna
clean it up in a second we'll see if we
can do this one a little better my brows
are by far my longest and also in my
least favorite parts I make
opportunities because it's to do the
same thing every single time like you
never get to spice it up or anything
like think if I can finish my eyebrows
and have them looking decent with a few
minutes remaining
I will actually be golden for this
challenge I can pop out of mascara and
lashes and a lip pretty quickly but
these brows may be my death wish oh my
god this iros bad I feel like we can
read this word okay I don't know that
finish this anymore what time we are
left
well NARS is over here no it's not her
is here where is the NARS kind of we
just saw I this is a joke
where Thanks thanks Karl
where's the concealer oh right here okay
great want any more of that and we're
gonna use this to clean up our brows
let's grab the brow kit right here we
have our flat top concealer brush okay
okay okay okay
not not a thought we can do that you can
do that you guys that is a decent sense
of round let's be real could be a little
better but it definitely could be a
whole lot worse let's pull in that
concealer down to my eyelid because what
I'm use that as an eyeshadow primer I
definitely do how time for eyeshadow
look today but I thought we should go
for a wing
can you use my fingers to blow us houses
I didn't bring a blending brush I feel
like at this point we're not even gonna
get a line around so let's just get
right to mascara
I know Bennifer Laurel ah okay let's go
over here then if it were a little ashes
on my all-time favorite mascaras for
literally the longest time I stand by
this it's a really really bomb mascara
using mascara from Sephora testers is
probably one of the worst ideas ever in
the entire world because I use are so
easy here to transfer you guys know I'm
already legally blind so I can't wait to
wake up tomorrow with a sty but you know
what we gotta make do with what we have
so just gonna pop this on I'm gonna keep
my mascara right here we have the losses
and it lips to do still so let's see if
you can do this I have my lashes right
here and my last glue right here let's
see oh my god I don't have to be first
oh my god that is not okay you're
kidding me
I'll clean it up oh my god I can't even
put lashes on wit squeezers let alone
without this is a Joe be careful without
sticking stuff on the floor oh you're
kidding me don't even have time to fix
that okay blood stuff hook those up
we're gonna do this one right here
that's the worst lip application I've
ever done in my entire life setting
spray we need to lock into place oh my
god we my beak looks evaluate actually
let's evaluate as I clean up the floor
hold on let's see what we can do here we
love a humble sister this was so much
harder than I expected like I was saying
going into all the products that I
usually need are all over the place in
every different Sephora whereas in my
neural maker pretend I have everything
right down in front of me I think
majority of this challenge is actually
spent with me running around Sephora not
being able to make decisions on what
products they wanted to use or where I
wanted to use them and not really took
away from a lot of the time doing my
actual makeup I feel like the primer and
foundation application were really fine
but we definitely lost it at concealer
you guys know that my go-to is always
the charge tape tape which I don't
actually carry out Sephora and I have
not used the different concealer than
that and literally it's been a good like
year I think now I think it was
definitely little bit shook when I had
to use a lesser coverage concealer and I
think from that moment on we were just
screwed miss laura mercier she was a
smart sister because she didn't stock up
a single Oh
hooray stock Dustin you played me real
good with a cow well now there's powder
here but beforehand
there was no miss Laura Mercier so I did
not get to set my face today Wow I love
when that happened Hertz
and then we moved on to of course
contouring of course we had the Kat Von
D and light palette you guys know that
is my all-time favorite and then baking
once again we had no chances of sending
powders and we had to end up going with
rubber FX powder which I've never
actually used it for let's see how she
looks
oh not that bad okay it went on very
very white and was definitely sticking
on my face white as well so I was a
little bit spooked not gonna lie that it
wasn't gonna work out but I think my
face actually looks really really good
the lashes are there but I wouldn't
necessarily call them on I don't believe
in a good pair of tweezers for la chop
location so definitely not the best and
then of course we did we had a few
seconds up to put on our lipstick I went
with just a tart liquid lipstick I hate
that's color but it'll be the first
thing that I grabbed with me looks fine
at this challenge I think was a success
I finished everything in time my face
doesn't look the best but from far away
and a little bit of phase 2 and I feel
like we could definitely power for a
full-on event ready glam
maybe alright you guys we just got home
from Sephora and not complete says get
ready with me in Sephora using all tests
and makeup at under 30 minute challenge
we need a better name for that ASAP I
had so much fun filming this challenge
today you guys an overall even though my
face doesn't look as perfect as I
usually like it - I'm definitely really
happy with the results and I think that
that answers the burning question that
we've all been wondering is it possible
to get fully ready in Sephora yes I
think it really is of course I did bring
a few tools but you know we're just
being a sanitarium sisters just a quick
little sister just claim her as well at
the end of all my challenge videos I
always say baby I showed this one at
home
make sure to shoot me a picture and let
me know how wet or for this one please
do not try to duplicate this one we did
talk to the manager staff a Sephora
beforehand and made sure not only was it
ok to fill in there but also do this
challenge in general they were kind
enough to let us do this but that's only
because they knew who I was I shop there
all the time and I know that I was a
beauty guru filming this for a YouTube
video let's be straight up and real we
have all brought products before
especially from drugstore where you
can't actually try it out and we put it
on and
literally loved the worst so I think
that the fact they were able to try out
products in Sephora before actually
buying them is such an incredibly
helpful system that makes makeup
shopping it's so much easier and
although this challenge is very very fun
to film for you guys please do not do
this because at the end of the day it's
very much taking advantage of Sephora
and I don't want to do that to them if
there's an emergency situation
definitely go in for a good impression
sis or glam touch-up the staff is all
amazing and will definitely help you
look at the beautiful and fabulous but
anything more you're doing that at your
own risk
you do not hear this from me Oh Papa
