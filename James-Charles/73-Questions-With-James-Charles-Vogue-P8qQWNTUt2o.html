place do you think you could see us I
marked look at how cute wait that's
definitely Kim Kardashian jealous James
James assume he's up there
exactly where I thought he'd be James
James hello good morning sunshine it is
Vogon we are here for your 73 questions
somebody yes are you ready for your
interview no well it's 1:00 p.m. what
are you doing still asleep for well
around what time do you usually go to
sleep between 10:00 p.m. for well I
guess you'd consider yourself an eye a
louver a morning person mm not
necessarily I'm more recently have been
but speaking of schedule what days do
you usually upload on YouTube Oh
whenever I have a good video right do
you find it difficult to come up with
new content consistently that's the yeah
the beauty community is getting really
boring oh well what are your favorite
types of videos to film I really like
well what video would you say is the
most favorite that you've ever done I
would have to say my singing my makeup
routine video ooh and what did you do in
that video how to improv my way through
the lyrics
it was crazy put so much violence so
would you say music is a big part of
your life I would for sure I've been
singing but I think the whole thing
unfortunately for everybody's ears I see
that there is a piano on the floor do
you play at all playing would not
exactly be the word I would use to
describe it well how long have you been
playing it for then oh I taught myself
kind of right here so I never actually
take it lesson well do you mind playing
us a little something I can try let's
hear it give it all you got
can
before
Bravo that was amazing
who knew you have that all in yo yeah me
neither
well who is your favorite artist
probably dummy and why do you say that
well she's iconic she's beautiful she
has some of the best locals in the game
and we both had pretty bad
oh yes how could we forget flashback
Mary well you've definitely been someone
who's caused quite the controversy
online what scandal do you think you
deserve the least oh and what about the
scandal you deserve the most I mean it's
super super important to grow and learn
from your mistakes and I'm glad that
you're doing just that um well let's go
back to makeup for a second please
what is the worst make it mistake you've
ever made oh when I first read makeup I
could not figure out how to put on
eyelashes speaking of lashes it looks
like you're missing a little something
oh yeah oh my god actually oh no and as
there a reason why you haven't done that
James super super it is insane you're
very welcome
well if that's not your favorite what is
your favorite part of your makeup
routine mmm I would have to say I said
oh just because it boys allows you to be
really really creative hey see what is
your favorite eyeshadow palette probably
way more Fiat 35b
Eva's literally already at hand and
that's like my rainbow power well I've
heard he had a Murphy code what is it
called James returned first of all well
have you ever thought about making your
own palette absolutely it is definitely
slang that is on my bucket list for the
future that's for sure well do you mind
telling us a little bit more about it no
because if I did somebody's
let's do it this beauty industry is
ruthless have you ever had anything
stolen from you I've actually had my
wallet so in three different time oh how
did you manage to let that happen
I'm not exactly the most organized
person
well if organization isn't a strong
point about you what would you say is
I've always brutally honest love ah
interesting what is your sign I'm
allowed empowered Gemini yeah um well
how do you deal with the online gem and
I hate do you feel personally attacked
ever online regardless so I don't really
care about that type of stuff
alright well what is your least favorite
social media platform probably Twitter
and what about your most favorite
probably Instagram it's always really
got my start and it's where my Vegas all
I guess how long ago did you get your
start on Instagram oh my gosh that's
like nothing how long have you been
wearing makeup for then also just over
two years oh my gosh I need to learn
from you because I'm still learning and
it has been well over two years but it's
awesome that you blew up quickly what is
your biggest achievement this year I
just had 2 million subscribers on my
youtube channel and what do you call
your subscribers
how cute but why is that well I think
the word fan is ugliest word in the
world
and I consider them like my family well
having a lot of people following you
online is amazing but does it ever
become overwhelming let us all know Oh
not gonna lie honestly yeah it really
does having 2 million people watching
your every move is a huge weight on my
shoulders but I'm very very blessed to
have the opportunity of being a role
model for a ton of people so I love to
be able to learn and grow
and hopefully provide them with good
morals so what's your favorite part of
having a platform um sorry people I feel
like my favorite part is getting
messages from little boys that's amazing
but do you ever think there will ever be
a day where it's equally as common for
every single gender to wear makeup
hmm that's a question I get asked a lot
honestly I do think so but I think it's
definitely going to take a while
unfortunately do still live in a society
with very very having stereotypes but
because of beauty bloggers like myself
and more and more brands working towards
gender equality
I do think they'll be a day in the
future where everybody gets rockin
beautiful glam amazing way to lead a
path by the way your lashes look
incredible thank you they look amazing I
see you have heaps and heaps of makeup
how much do you think it is all worth if
you could guess probably upwards of a
million dollars some of these brands are
getting real brave no no no that's okay
well here's a classic question I'm sure
you've been asked well over a million
times if you are stranded on a deserted
island what you are robbed pencil
translucent setting powder honestly
those are great options
those flowers by the way are gorgeous
who are they from two-face actually
sometimes we not are hitting two million
they're so sweet oh so sweet
do you usually get a lot of stuff from
brands yeah
these packages Lily right here from this
morning alone oh my gosh well first of
all this is a gorgeous photo of you

the single life Laden problem proud okay

from tinder but not gonna lie he was ooh

would automatically swipe right on Oh

big part of your life uh kind of
I do wish it was a lot bigger part

seeing me and hoodies and sweatpants at
this point amazing would you mind yes of
course of course I see there are a lot
of hoodies on this rack where are they
from you have so many they are so cute

expensive thing you've ever bought ah
