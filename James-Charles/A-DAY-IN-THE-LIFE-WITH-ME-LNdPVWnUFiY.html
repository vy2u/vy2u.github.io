good morning sisters James Charles here
and welcome back to my youtube channel
and also welcome back to sister upload
week today is Thursday I hope everyone
was having an amazing day so far if you
have not yet checked out all the other
videos that have gone up for the past 2
5 days still don't know how I've done it
make sure to go check those out and also
make sure you stay tuned for tomorrow
Sunday which is the final day of sister
upload week and it is flashbacks
brand-new acapella cover it's currently
7 22 in the morning I went to bed at 3
from editing yesterday's video so it
looks like I'm gonna be running on four
hours of sleep today but that's a
personal problem not your guys's today's
schedule is absolutely jam-packed we
have so many fun things to do and also a
lot of business to take care of but
unfortunately most of those things that
I have to do today require me to wear a
full face of glam makeup even though my
job is a beauty guru my heart lies in
doing creative makeup and fun videos and
not wearing makeup around for long
periods of time that is in fact one of
my least favorite things in the world
since I'm just gonna be doing my normal
everyday makeup routine that I've
literally showed you guys 64 times
already I thought I would try to make
this video a little bit more interesting
by making it into a vlog so I'm gonna
take you guys around with me all day
today and to make it even more
interesting we're gonna be testing out a
setting spray that claims it can last
for up to 16 hours I honestly have no
idea what time I'm gonna get back home
tonight and be able to do glam I am
praying it's not 16 hours at this point
if it is I'm just like going back to bed
but yeah if you want to have any fun
little sister's day with me I'm gonna
get up right now because I'm already
running a little bit late keep on
watching
coming tomorrow oh these underwear
literally work wonder maybe we'll go
ahead and use a co James for 10% off
hoodies today these officially sold out
on sisters apparel you guys are so so
crazy this video is sponsored by my
babes over to skin to media I am
associated to be partnering with them
for this video and you guys can now use
Co jeans for 10% off your Scandinavia
products you're welcome
hello excuse me
well sisters today is already out to a
great start
whoo let's do this so before I go in
with any makeup so now I'm gonna spritz
a face using the skin to Navia the
makeup primer spray and this is the oil
control version the spray on this is
literally so soft and it's crazy and I'm
gonna make sure to concentrate most of
this in my t-zone region because but I'm
wearing makeup for of long Priya
logically time that is usually where it
gets oily the fastest as you guys heard
earlier I am partnering with skins in
Avia for today's video so thank you very
much them for sponsoring this you guys
know I don't really do a whole lot of
sponsored come to it's mostly just the
coupon codes they are so so kind and
it's a really really fun at brand to
work with they have been at literally
such a breath of fresh air and their
products are so incredibly bomb too so
for today's video I'm just gonna be
doing my normal makeup I have so many
things to do today I don't even know how
I'm gonna end up doing it I need to get
clear really fast
I have a new video going up I have a few
different protocol meetings I have to go
to Starbucks to get pink kitty drinking
tea at some point for today's a new
upload I have to go get my nails done as
well because these look the most
disgusting ever and then I'm supposed to
have dinner with some friends tonight
and then I also have to go home and film
for tomorrow's video I already know I'm
gonna crash the second I finish editing
later on tonight I'm gonna have to keep
this makeup look on today for upwards of
like 16 to 18 hours and skins the Navy
of setting sprays are known to last for
16 hours which is so so crazy so I'm
gonna take you guys on my ride with me
today on all my fun events and we're
gonna put the setting spray to the test
Canada Scandinavia makeup finishing
spray hold for 16 hours on end we're
gonna find out
I literally wear the same pair of
eyelashes almost every time doing makeup
now like it's getting a little sad at
this point I mean should I stop probably
am I gonna stop absolutely not
I just went ahead and I quickly wet my
bake off and you guys know that the next
up is always Highlander we got to get
the glow on of course but before I do
that I'm gonna go in and spread a face
really really lightly using just the
skin a navy eye makeup finishing spray
this is not my Lexus final spurt
obviously I'm just gonna put a little
bit of this on to really like set all
those powders in place and make them
melt together and then actually I love
doing this before highlighter as well
because it gets the scanner ready and I
feel like it makes the highlighter stick
a lot better and just gives a more of a
blinding luck you see what I'm talking
about
whoa I'm gonna be out and about quite a
lot place so I do want to add some blush
just to add a little bit of color to my
face because I'm looking a little bit
pale and then of course a new lip to
finish off this look
okay wow that s today's look already
complete we literally just did that in
30 minutes I have no idea how I just
pulled that together but I am so
impressing myself right now let's go and
finish this look off once and for all
using the skin tone a via the makeup and
finishing spray once again this is the
oil control version because the sister
gets a little bit of personal grab my
fan do the little warp and then Fanta an
if you guys can once you finish your
makeup and use the setting spray I would
always grab a fan or even like a big
pallet and use that to dry your face off
this is really gonna make the settings
right like melt into the skin and blend
all the powders together and just set
really really smoothly
instead of like setting all crusty and
dusty and vanilla cake looking like on
top alright guys and that is this light
glam look off complete the skin to
Maivia setting spray supposed to last
for 16 hours on end that is a very very
hefty claim in a long time it is
currently 921 in the morning and I am
running very very late for everything
that I have to do today and there is a
lot on the agenda so without further ado
if you'd like to see me putting this to
the test right here and just follow me
around let's have a little bit of a
sister's day keep on watching hope you
think that was probably the fastest I've
ever gotten glam in my entire life oh my
god the iPhone X camera is like scary I
don't even know if I want to keep it I'm
so spooked it's like too good quality
this doesn't even look good anymore
regardless I have three phone calls that
I have to hop on right now that I'm
currently running a little bit late for
I'm they're all business calls one is
with a brand that I really really love
one is with a brand that I don't work
with yet but really want to work with so
I'm looking forward to that one hardcore
and one is with a brand that we've been
going back and forth with on email and
things have been going too well so I'm a
little bit spooked I'm really sure how
it's gonna go but I'm running late
my name is James Reynolds so nice to
meet you guys finally I'm so they were
able to get on the phone today oh no no
no no no for sure I just want to make
sure we're innocent it's like really
gonna get the scissors involved just let
everyone like has a really good time
oh my god you're kidding no way oh if we
want to do just episode it has to be Co
James I mean it definitely isn't the
most but what did you guys created let
me get this right here you guys can't
some of your products to try out first
to make sure I like them before I make a
video for my youtube channel that almost
2 million people watch a week rating so
other manager all of you know like the
contractual and legal boring of mumbo
jumbo and then you can always reach me
on this number if you have a girl I do
not work for free okay YouTube another
good day bye sister this one but you
guys think this is email if you wanna
reach out for any future opportunities
oh my god okay - okay I'll take you
later on
taury color is actually doing just fine
usually I would say you win some you
lose most but today we won most and lost
only one and probably for the better
okay sisters just doing a quick little
check in here it was probably 150 2 p.m.
I just uploaded today's brand-new video
with the Dolan twins it was so much fun
filming and you guys are killing it so
far
I'm currently replying to a bunch of
different comments oh I don't know this
checking they're gonna go back to doing
that but I want to happen because it has
been about 5 hours of writing this now
and look at my frickin face
are you kidding it looks so good my skin
is still extremely not like you can't
see any oil or anything at all looks so
good the only thing is here there's one
little crease and then of course lip
Krusty's but that happens every time I
wear my makeup that's my actual skin it
is still not I see absolutely no oil I
am a little bit shocked by this setting
spray guys this is working way better
than I even expected so I'm quickly
walking right now in downtown LA to get
my nails done
I need a fail so badly please stop
commenting on my videos and Instagram
pictures done in 81 I know god they look
awful I just have not had any time but
I'm gonna go to my normal guy he doesn't
so good it get a nice nude set it is
literally so hot and sunny today in LA
but oh my god that how it looks amazing
I feel really hot on the inside and I
feel like I should be sweating but my
skin is actually staying really really
dry
you
so I just finished a nail appointment it
is currently 356 p.m. at my skin is
still looking so Bahamut guys I'm
literally not sweating not only in the
slightest this looks amazing
that was probably the most needed fail
like ever of history my nails look so
bad
thank God they are now on fleek and
ready to go I'm gonna head home right
now and edit as much as I possibly can
for a little bit and then head over to
dinner I need to see sister Tana ana
Mari and Trevor I have not seen them in
literally so long of course you guys to
be coming with me so let's go it is
really 7:30 at night and my skin is
still looking so so Bom
I am getting a little excuse me miss I
went this er mojo I am still welding my
makeup today Tana do you notice anything
different on my face in a 737 wearing
makeup for almost 12 hours now I think
that is ten hours we love a mouth but
yeah it still looks so good like I
literally have not done any touch-ups
are you kidding oh so good this Nina
hello I just got back home and it's
currently 11:47 p.m. meeting I've had
this makeup on now for more than 14
hours oh my god I am making 150 percent
honest by saying I have not touched up
my face once today and looking in the
mirror it looks still so good if we're
being picky here my lips are obviously a
little bit crusty because I was just
eating I do have a smile crease but
literally I always get that that's
because I smile all day every day and
then my under eyes are creasing as well
but literally like look at my freaking
skin it still looks flawless if anything
is looking a little bit early I would
say it's my nose but like I'm not even
mad at it that happens all the time no
matter what and usually it happens
within like one hour of meeting I wake
up it's been 14 I'm honestly beyond
impressed now with the skin a navy eye
makeup finishing spray this claims that
it's supposed to last for 16 hours and
obviously I only wore it for 14 but
let's be real who's gonna wear makeup
for 16 hours straight first of all not
me I'll tell you that right now I think
it's very safe to say at this point that
this setting spray is a huge huge win in
my book as well as the primer spray as
well both the oil control versions like
I said my face looks so beat still
14 hours I'm ready to take this off yes
but if I need it to keep going out with
this what I yeah probably if you guys
want to check out any skin the name of
your products I will list the stuff and
down below and of course you can use
coach James for money off your products
I just want to say a major major thank
you to skins nav for partnering with me
on this video
they were so incredibly amazing to work
with I cannot even begin to explain they
literally were like do whatever you want
make an amazing video and we'll be happy
with it I can't even tell you how many
brand deals I've rejected because brands
will literally request like a six page
MLA style format essay with like full
citations on things to say about their
product oh my girl it's a foundation
does it look good or does it not look
good it really it's not that deep so
