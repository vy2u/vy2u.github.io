intro club hi guys it's James Charles
welcome back to my youtube channel first
of all I just want to say holy crap
thank you so much for 300,000
subscribers
wow that is already so crazy and now I
feel like every single time I make a
video I have to make some type of little
snippet in the intro where I say thank
you for some very very large obscene
amount of subscribers so that's really
cool you guys are slaying the
subscribing game thank you so much for
all the support on my videos as you guys
know and I said a lot of times already
so far I'm sorted to see like where we
keep going I feel like every video is
getting better and better so that's cool
also I have a microphone on hopefully
the audio is a lot better because you
guys have been dragging me for it so I
ordered a microphone so hopefully you
know I am dedicated to say the least
anyways we've been bugging your
tutorials left and right so when you
make up videos so many different types
of fun things but we have yet to do is a
Q&amp;amp;A so I posted on Instagram asked you
guys for a bunch of questions and now
we're going to answer them and let you
know a little bit more about me James
Charles you already know who I am or
else you won't be on this channel
alright I have all the questions ready
on my phone we're going to go ahead and
get started
Brian asked what do you look for in a
guy a pulse any tips on contouring your
nose um cross your fingers beforehand
and hope for the best
Dana asked what's your favorite snapchat
filter this one Alicia asked isn't
really hard managing a career and school
while they're in two separate places it
definitely could be a lot easier but it
also could be a lot harder
luckily my administrators and teachers
are all like super on board with
everything that I'm doing so they are
helping me kind of make it through
without having like emotional trauma
Tiffany asks what's your favorite thing
about your life now and how has becoming
basically famous affected you probably
the coolest thing about like everything
that has happened to me recently has
been getting to meet all of you guys in
like public places like allows out to
dinner last night with friends and like
15 people like came up to music we take
a picture I was like oh wow I just want
to enjoy my orange chicken in peace but
it was definitely like really really
cool to be able to like see you guys and
see everybody who's supporting me so
that's probably my favorite thing about
it oh imagine my phone dying in the
middle of my Q&amp;amp;A oh it actually just
died as I said that that's fake Sam
asked how long does it take to create a
simple look or even one of your special
ones well it definitely depends like I
threw this together in probably like an
hour but my like more
circuit ones can definitely take up to
like seven hours of my longest one for
Halloween this past year so I could
definitely be a little bit of a lengthy
process to say the least but it's like
obviously what I love to do so I'll just
sit down hang out with friends
FaceTime people listen to music just to
like keep the time going but usually
it's like oh good time
clearly it's a good time or else I
wouldn't be setting seven hours doing
Esther says where you sing me a song you
lovely man oh hell no Maria ask James
tell us top or bottom well Maria when it
comes to my eyelashes my top lashes are
already pretty long so I would
definitely say that I prefer the bottom
Andrew asks how do you say happy and
confident in this world of haters love
you James Oh Andrew I love you as well
that's a great question that I get asked
all the time I really try hard to not
let hate bother me and I know that's
like not the best way to just be like oh
yeah don't let it get to you because a
lot of people can't really do that but
for me it's just like everybody has a
right to their opinion and that's
totally okay if you don't like me I
don't care also now the Instagram has
like hate comment filtering I have a
bunch of like target nasty words filter
it out so it's you can't comment them so
at this point if you do a hate comment
on my photos I'm like slow clap for you
because you really put in a lot of
effort so you must be really really mad
and it's a great thing to be opinionated
these days arrow asked what you're here
flavor ramen pork people would say
chicken I like the program Jay Chou's
ASMR channel coming 2017 Kristina asked
how do you get your teeth so white okay
so this is actually a question I get all
the time especially when I post smiling
pictures on Instagram but I promise it's
not the face tune right until I worked
very very hard for these babies right
here I had braces for a long period of
time and I'm not going to let them get
ugly and crusty and old now I've been
using a teeth whitening kit from Smile
Sciences now for a few weeks I have not
talked about it yet because I really
want to make sure that it actually
worked before I went and promoted
anything because you guys know that I
never want to promote like a crappy
product and I definitely was extremely
skeptical before in trying this but I am
very excited to say that actually like
really does actually work my teeth look
very good as you can see hello right
here there's meat it comes with two
little trays and like teeth whitening
gel and then on the clasp like blue
lights that you just and you let it sit
and then you take it off and bam your
teeth are
whole lot lighter it is cruelty-free
vegan USA made and even though you're
shopping a thing into your mouth doesn't
hurt oh good catch
like I said I was extremely skeptical at
first but after trying it really does
work so it's like a great product of
course you guys know me I emailed smile
sciences that I asked for a coupon code
shocker
you can now use code J Charles to get
the entire set for only $29 deathly
would recommend check it out if you want
to um yeah so that is that on that Lilly
asked why does James Charles our makeup
like when you get married your wife will
make a really bad choice well sister to
I have news for you
are you Virgin Mary asked ah Stephanie
asked will this be the last question you
ask yes thank God we're done alright

interesting ones and some great ones as

about hey that being said if you guys
