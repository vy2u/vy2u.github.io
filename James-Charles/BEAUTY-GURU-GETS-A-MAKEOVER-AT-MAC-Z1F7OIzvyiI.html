welcome back to my youtube channel
cutting straight to the point
hello everybody we are back and we are
sitting down for episode two of this
mini makeover series
if you have not yet checked out episode
one which is last week's video this mini
makeover series make sure to click up
here or up here I'm not sure what side
it's on where we got my makeup done at
Sephora it was so much fun for today's
video we're going to be going to match
to get the same full glam makeover I
made my appointment and we're gonna be
heading out in a few minutes but before
we do that I definitely wanna make a few
quick disclaimers because some people
majorly missed the point of last week's
video and this entire series while a lot
of you guys definitely loved the first
makeover video if there was a lot of
people that misinterpreted the point of
the video first of all I can't even
reiterate how many times I've said it
throughout the video but apparently
y'all's ears were closed the artists in
the video asked for word did such an
amazing job I'm gonna leave the artists
Instagram right here her name is crystal
marine go like her last post and go
comment saying sister James sent you and
show her the love because she did such
an amazing job and I don't know why so
many people were thinking that the point
of the video was for me to shed on her
because it was not during prom season of
all season event season and wedding
season so many people go to these
various different stores and get their
makeup done in order to feel beautiful
and confident on their special day at
the end of each makeover we're gonna
come right back here I'm going to show
you guys the finished look and then
we're going to talk about it every
different makeup store trains their
artists in different ways and every
artist has different styles and
techniques that they do makeup in which
is why I think that this series is such
a cool and fun idea to be able to
showcase different artists different
styles and different techniques and then
how they may differ from my very own
that you guys get to see all the time
obviously I'm not gonna like everything
that they do on me and if I was to do
the makeup on them I'm sure they would
not like everything that I was gonna do
on them either and that is totally okay
I'm not gonna sit here and drag any
artists because the whole point of
getting your makeup done is to have a
different style than your own which is
the whole fun behind it but I will talk
about things that I would have done
differently or preferred so therefore
you guys are watching me from makeup
tips can get a rough idea of what your
makeup or experience may be like if you
want to get your glam done at one of
these places so you can make it more
educated decision next time you have a
special event to go to and finally
before we get this video started the
last thing I want to address is the
comment about me of being treated like a
normal customer at Sephora I want to be
able to give you guys an accurate
patience of what a normal makeover at
one of these stores may look like but
that can sometimes you really really
hard when the employees know who you are
there have definitely been times in the
past where I've walked into various
different makeup stores and have been
greeted with special treatment I've seen
a lot of different products before they
actually hit the shelves I've gotten
products that were supposed to be out of
stock and I've also gotten different
things for free because of my name I do
want to apologize if I came out as
entitled or conceited in the last video
I definitely missed the mark on what I
wanted to say so I'm very very sorry for
that I do not think of myself as any
higher than any other artist I am just a
normal HTML kid with a few blending
brushes like my Instagram bio says but I
did want to address that because it has
happened in the past it's just the
reality of the situation it's really not
that deep all about being said though
there is no denying that I have worked
my ass off to become a name in this
industry if you hate me if you hate my
videos if you hate the way I do my
makeup if you hate the way I talk that's
totally fine but word of advice stop
watching my videos stop commenting and
stop talking about me because you're the
ones keeping me relevant on that
trending page I'm alright that is
everything I have to say I hope that
cleared everything up and without
further ado let's head over to Mac and
get our damn makeup done alright guys so
we are back home from our Mac make over
my appointment was at 4 o'clock today
and we just got home and is currently
601 actually and was about 15 minutes of
travel time there and back it was
probably about an hour and a half
appointment total so it definitely not
bad for a full glam make over my artist
today was named Helen and you can find
her an Instagram and I heart Helen
definitely go show her all the love from
his sisters tell her sister James sent
you she was so sweet and so nice and
just like the last video my artist did
not know who I was and one point she
asked me if I was a youtuber and I was
like yes girl but I only have a small
channel which may have been a little bit
of apply because all your sisters out
there know how big we have become we are
so close to two million subscribers so
definitely click that subscribe button
if you have not already but she was so
sweet and so nice without further ado
let's pull in this mirror and look at
this makeup the super close-up so before
we actually went in and started on at
the glam makeup today I showed my artist
a picture of two makeup look that I
wanted being the same exact one for the
last video I'm Jacqueline Hale it is
right here just in case you need a
little bit of a reminder but I'm gonna
be asking for the
same look from all the different places
that might go I know a lot of you guys
in the last video we're definitely
commenting that it was kind of stupid
for me to just tell the artist to do
whatever they want because as a client
you are definitely supposed to ask for
what you want in order for the artist to
give it to you which I agree with
so once I show them to the photo I
clarified that I wanted book Herbert
Foundation a lot of glow
not too much bronzer and a more snatched
nose and she said okay to all those
things which I thought was really really
great to give her a little bit more
direction based on my personal
preferences so therefore the end result
won't be judged on personal preference
things because a lot of people were
really mad about that in the last video
don't worry I got you so the first thing
that she did we started off with priming
my face and she actually used a Mac BB
cream which is saying that I've never
seen done before she said it was a light
and sticky base to make the skin a more
natural and even off the route for the
foundation process later on she next one
into my brows using the Mac brow pencil
and I honestly really really like how
the brows turned out I feel like she
added a really really nice part um she
definitely do not make them too thick
and I definitely love love love all the
love that she defined the tail and
pulled it out as well as many of you
guys know I've recently been trying to
make my tails more out as opposed to
more down which allows for a lot more
eyeshadow shape these brows are
definitely a huge win in my book next
was the eyes and she first started off
by priming them using the Mac painterly
paint-pot which is a Paint Pot that like
literally every beauty guru in the
entire world uses except for me for some
reason
I have no vendetta against it I just
have never actually got around to buying
one but she used it today and I think it
worked beautifully as a eyeshadow base I
really do plan on trying it out
eventually
I sort of go ahead under the eyeshadows
today she used the Mac single shadows in
the shade soft and gentle Brown script
I'm into it Swiss chocolate sweet heat
and nylon and this my look is really
really good looking at the eye shadow
close-up I am so so shook this honestly
looks really really good as you guys can
see there was a really really smooth and
even transition between of course the
problem highlight the transition shade
the deeper shade in the crease the
darker shade in the outer corner and
then even there's a smooth transition
between the metallic shade on the lid
which is so so well done she even went
ahead and added a black winged liner to
this look I'm actually not even sure if
Jacqueline has a wing on in the original
photo you really can't tell based on the
angle that her face and
is that but she went ahead and added it
anyway and this liner is so good too she
used a gel liner which I was really
really spooked about when she pulled it
out because doing a really really even
and tiny precise winged liner with a gel
is not the easiest thing in the world
but she absolutely slayed it this liner
is ready to cut a bitch that is for sure
on the lower waterline she lined that
using a block I call it and then blend
it out using the brown script eyeshadow
I believe I don't think once again in
the photo of Jocelyn she has black in
her waterline but it definitely is a
very very smoky look and I really really
love how this turned out as well I
actually think I prefer this over at the
light waterline I haven't done black in
the waterline for a smoky look in the
longest time ever but honestly I really
really missed this because it makes my
eyes well my contacts pop so so much
when it came to the lashes once again I
did ask for falsies and I didn't catch
the name of these ones unfortunately but
they were Mac branded and I was really
really spooked because they were like
the original size that I was like girl
my eyes are very very tiny I usually cut
a lot off the lashes and she measured
him and she's like oh you're fine and I
was like woah okay but she actually
glued on the bulb and and she glued them
on so well I don't know what she did I
don't know what she used but I need her
to glue my lashes everyday because they
look so good I literally cannot feel
them either and I have no idea like how
this is even going onto my eyes right
now but I'm not even gonna ask questions
I'm just gonna appreciate the fact that
somebody was able to glue and a full
eyelash onto my eyelid and it feels
amazing after the eyes came the base
makeup and like I told you guys I
definitely did ask for a fall Carmen
Sean Dacian scioscia end of the Studio
Fix fluid foundation which is definitely
full coverage if you are familiar with
Mac products and she mix together the
shades NW 13 and c4 and I think that
this is one of the best foundation
matches I have ever had in my entire
life she then went ahead and used the
lightest shade in the Mac Pro conceal
palette to highlight under my eyes and
then the center of the forehead and she
actually blinded out this entire look
using one of those triangular throw out
Beauty sponges which I was so so
surprised and impressed by obviously at
places like Sephora or alter you're
gonna have Beauty blenders but obviously
Mac does not have those so I was so
impressed that she somehow managed to
get such an even and go to blend using
those tiny ass drugstore sponges so once
the foundation and concealer were all on
and blended out she went ahead and set
my face using the Mac prep and
powder which I will say is not my
favorite looking closely at let me read
definitely is starting to wear down a
little bit under my eyes as you can see
there's some creases up in this region
and then also around the mouth and if I
touch my face it is a little bit tacky
this is totally personal preference but
I do wish she would have applied a
little bit more powder to my face to
really lock it in place and make sure it
stayed all night long because if I was
wearing this out I feel like I
definitely would start to sweat the
makeup off a little bit next it was time
to contour my face and once she was
doing I couldn't help but wonder what
she was using because I had never seen
it before it was there blotting powder
in the darkest shade when I asked she
told me was because it was a cool tone
shade which really obviously helps to
sculpt the face but it doesn't really
have that much covered so it allows for
a really really light and blended out
contour that looks almost natural and
girl when she told me that I was so
shocked because I did such a good idea
and as you can see it this contour looks
amazing she then used that same with
dark blotting powder to contour my nose
which I was so excited about obviously
in the last video my nose looked a
little bit big because I did not ask for
it to be contoured but when I asked at
this time she was very very happy to
give me a snatched nose looking at it in
the mirror I do wish she would have
pulled the lines a little bit closer
together to make him more and more
snatched up hereis but that's totally
personal preference and when she was
highlighting she did use that tiny
pencil brush like I always do to draw a
very very thin lie I know the
highlighter looks a little bit bigger
now but that's a sweat and oil matte
highlighter I promise it looked really
good at the time once the contour was
all on and nice and slayed she went into
the blush and for today's look she's the
Mac blush in the shade peaches and I was
literally so so excited to see her pull
it out I said not asked for I did not
request it but as many of you guys know
that is literally my favorite blush and
the only blush that I ever wear in my
looks it is such a beautiful warm tone
of peachy orange shade that I absolutely
love and she was so shook and she knew
that it was one of her favorites as well
and I thought it paired perfectly with
this look so next came the glow and she
was the Mac highlighter in the shade
soft and gentle which made my heart so
so warm because that's actually the
first highlighter that I ever ever used
on myself I used to use that same eye
harder every single damn day for every
look that I ever did because I could not
afford to buy another one so it has a
very very special place in my heart and
it is still to this day one of my
all-time favorite highlighter shades
looking at my face in the mirror I will
say that she definitely stuck by the
name of the
later being soft and gentle it
definitely is a subtle like glowing from
within type of look and based on the
picture with Jacqueline you can
definitely see that her highlight is
blinding and you guys know I love a
blinding Harley as well so I will say
that I wish to plant a little bit more
highlighter last certainly not least she
went and did my lipstick using the Mac
burgundy lip planner and then filled
them and using the carnivorous liquid
lipstick looking at my entire face and I
think that the lips are probably my
least favorite part of this look today I
do like the color that she chose I feel
as though it is a pretty close match to
the original picture that Jacqueline
wore but I'm not the biggest fan of the
shape before she went in started my lips
I did tell her that I do like my top lip
a little bit over life it is one of my
favorite things to do my makeup
techniques especially because I feel
like my lips are a little bit uneven so
over lining them allows me to get a
really really even imperfect lip shape
but when she applying it I feel like she
actually underlined my lips a little bit
you can almost see get a tiny little
border surrounding almost the entire
lips of where there is lips but no
actual makeup product which is
definitely not my favorite thing in the
entire world this is the finished look
and I honestly love how it turned out I
am so shook in a good way
that's for sure going into box today all
the employees were so so nice and my
artists like I said Helen was so kind so
sweet very very comforting and also
really really talented as you guys can
see she's only that she's been working
it back for the last 10 years which I
was so so impressed by and as you can
see her skill level and experience of
definitely reflects back in the makeup
thinking about my full experience today
at Mac and looking at my makeup in the
mirror I would rate today's makeover a 9
out of 10 the only two things that
really docked points today like I
excited to be the setting powder
I do wish she applied a little bit more
especially like around my smile lines
under my eyes because I am definitely
getting a few creases and there and I do
feel a little bit oily and also the left
I do wish you would have lined them a
little bit more to over line them or at
least even follow my natural lip line I
feel as though they are a little bit
underlying which isn't the most
flattering for my face but neither one
of these two things are deal-breakers
and this makeover was so successful in
my eyes at least alright guys and that
is all I have for this video today
