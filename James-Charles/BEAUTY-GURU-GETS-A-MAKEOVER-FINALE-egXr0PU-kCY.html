welcome back to my youtube channel so
not only welcome back to my channel but
also welcome back to a sister upload
week if you have no idea what's going on
I've been uploading every single day
this week it has been so much work but
it has also been so much fun to put out
so much condit for you guys that I'm
honestly really really loving it well I
do it ever again definitely not but it's
fun well if last night if you guys'd
might have checked out all the videos
that have gone up for the past few days
and make sure to check them out they'll
be linked down below and then the side
bar probably somewhere over there I'm
not really sure check out the channel
welcome to the sisterhood subscriber if
you have not already for today's video I
am so so pumped because today is the
finale of my little mini makeover series
as you guys know I am a beauty guru and
it is my job to do my own makeup almost
every single day but I rarely ever get
my makeup done by other artists last
week I started a super fun at makeover
series
on my channel where I went to Sephora
Mac and Ulta and got my makeup done at
all three locations I asked for this
picture right here of Jaclyn hill I'm
not gonna forget it this time
and each time came up with a very very
different result getting these mini glam
makeovers and showing you guys the
results was honestly so much fun and so
cool to see all the different artists
different styles and techniques that
they use on me I honestly learned so so
much but so many of you guys were saying
that for the finale you guys wanted to
see me do the look on myself and do how
I would normally do the same exact look
so for today's video that is exactly
what we're doing I'm gonna be recreating
that same exact look from Jaclyn hill on
myself or gonna be talking about all
three makeovers and my own makeover
we're gonna be comparing them all
talking about the prices talking about
the products talking about the truth tea
whatsoever I recommend you guys to go to
if you have a very special event so
without further ado let's go ahead and
get glam for one last time for this mini
makeover series grand finale
for my first step of my makeup routine
today I'm gonna grab the top out water
cream which is my all-time favorite
moisturizer I absolutely love using
moisturizer before my foundation and I
think a really really good skincare
routine is absolutely vital to a really
successful makeup routine and the places
that did that were Ulta and Sephora
before my makeover so major props to
them for that once I face is already a
nice and moisturized
of course my next step is going to be a
foundation and for today's look I'm
gonna be using the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD stick and I am in the shade Y
245 right now the Make Up For Ever stick
is definitely my all-time pure
foundations if you guys been subscribed
to me for a while you know that I've
been using it for a very very long time
just as a reminder when I went to
Sephora the artist used the bare
minerals foundation on me when I went to
Mac my artists used of course the Mac
Studio Fix fluid and when I went to Ulta
they used Born This Way and importantly
actually one of my all-time favorites as
well but the color was not exactly the
best match you guys know that I
definitely have a very very full
coverage type of base even when I do my
more light natural looks I still like a
very very full coverage foundation
because I do have pretty uneven skin
naturally and as well in the picture
that Jacqueline posted she is definitely
full beat glam there's no questions
about it so I feel like we definitely
needed a very very full coverage
foundation to match this look today for
consider today of course I'm gonna using
my heart-shaped concealer you guys don't
this is my all-time favorite and I'm in
the shade light sand I'm just gonna
apply this underneath my eyes on the
sides of my nose for the snatched look
when it comes to contouring and all the
high points of my face just to add a lot
of dimension and my Sephora makeover my
artists use the NARS radiant creamy
concealer and iMac makeover my artists
use the new Mac Pro Longwear concealer
and it my alta makeover my artists use
the Tarte save tape just like I'm using
right now so honestly we had a really
really good selection of concealers and
all the different places that we went to
then I'm gonna put this in it very very
well using a damp Beauty Blender
unfortunately we have no triangular
makeup sponges today next one I take my
damp Beauty Blender and dip it into my
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
and just use this to set my entire face
and like my foundation in place at my
Sephora makeover my artists use this
powder which as you guys know is my
all-time favorite have I Mac makeovers
to use the Mac translucent setting
powder which the spoiler alert I
absolutely hated that I my Ulta makeover
he used the it cosmetics trust as a
setting powder which I literally do not
even know it
but worked fine next to Condor my face
today I'm going to grab my Kat Von D
shade and light palette buddies my
morphe m14 one brush and dip into it the
last shade and let's tiny bit into the
middle shade and use this to it chisel
out my cheekbones in the photo that
Jacqueline posted she definitely had a
very very light and soft contour which
honestly is not really my cup of tea you
guys know that I love a good snatched
cheekbone a very very chiseled jawline
and definitely a contoured and lowered
forehead that is for sure but obviously
we're doing our best to recreate the
photos today so I'm going to go very
very light on the contour powder and
make sure not to go too too crazy and I
supported make over my artists use the
hourglass ambient lighting bronzer to
contour my face which i thought was a
little bit weird first of all I didn't
know it existed which obviously means
nothing but I felt as though it was a
little bit of a shimmery product which
is kind of weird for bronzer it
definitely was more of like a bronze or
higher that combo rather than a contour
so I do wish it was a little bit more
chilled out and a more cool toned softer
type of situation and Mac my artists
actually used the Mac of blotting
powders in at the darkest shade which I
thought was so so cool because she used
blotting powders instead of an actual
bronzer her contour and gave her really
really light washed a color which I
thought was super super dope I've never
seen that done before and I think that
by adding that light wash of color
instead of like the intensive bronzer in
contour and by far gave that contour the
most accurate to the original picture of
Jacqueline and I loved how it looked and
then finally for the ultimate over my
artist who's the anasazi Beverly Hills
contour kit this is definitely my
all-time favorites their products are so
good and blend out so smoothly it wasn't
the best contra but it also wasn't the
worst now when it comes to the nose I'm
using a morphe m4a3 3 brush and the same
exact shapes from the Kat Von D shade
and light palette and I'm drawing my
nose contour very very tight together
I'm not gonna talk about my nose contour
in respect to my Sephora makeover
because I did not ask for it to be
contoured which is definitely my faults
that one is out of the picture but I did
ask for a pinched nose contour at both
Mac and Ulta and I think that the result
at both were honestly not the best it is
definitely not like the nose contour and
Mac or alte looked bad by any means it
literally took me a year to figure out
how to actually contour my nose and make
it look decent other than just editing
it and every single photo so I really
don't blame them at all but I definitely
do think at both makeovers if I say
pinched nose it could have been a little
bit smaller and then once again gooder
done by Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder and my damp Beauty
Blender and I'm going to lightly
make my face to really intensify it my
nose contour and my cheekbone contour I
personally don't think it's that weird
that none of the artists chose to bake
me today honestly a lot of people think
that it's really really stupid and
doesn't really make a difference I
personally do see a difference
especially when it comes like the nose
contour baking the sides my nose has
literally changed my nose contour for
the better but I don't blame them baking
is obviously a technique they started
from drag queens and is slowly trickled
its way until I go online and social
media makeup but I feel like hasn't
fully integrated into like the regular
beauty world so I don't really think
it's that strange I ever won like I said
I do love baking so I'm just gonna do it
myself today to really intensify those
highlights alright so while my face is
baking in the oven at 350 degrees I'm
gonna go into my brows and for today's
draw also gonna use my benefit precisely
my brow pencil I always terrified brows
are drawing little hair like strokes in
the center just to add a little bit of
dimension and fill them in slightly but
not make them super super defined and
then I'll just go in and start doing the
tail all the tail more out as opposed to
down this is line that I actually
recently changed my brow routine to but
I feel good as honestly made the world
of her difference it makes my brows look
more arch which therefore just gives me
a more like lifted and a pretty look to
my face and it also gives me a lot more
room for eyeshadow so I feel like
drawing them out is my new favorite
Brown trick and it just flatters my face
really really well for both my Sephora
and Ulta makeovers my artists use the UH
Nastasia Brown definer to define at my
brows and for my Mac makeover
she used the Mac brow pencil which I've
actually never used before brows are
definitely a really really personal
thing when it comes to makeup I feel
like things such as like base makeup
contouring highlighting and then like
eyeshadow or very much like one style
fits most type of situation but brows
like frame the entire face they can
change your entire facial shape or
structure or expression so I feel like
brows are like a very very vital thing
and are very very personal which is
probably why I didn't really like any of
the brows really restore and I
definitely do how much to what I would
normally do I don't think I think the
eyebrows were particularly bad all the
Ulta one definitely could have had a
little bit more attention paid to them
but I just think they weren't really my
style I'm then just gonna go to my
benefit give me a brow gel just to brush
through all those hairs and lock them in
place you guys know that I'm definitely
someone who has a lot of eyebrows that
is for sure so I always like to use a
brow so just make sure those hairs are
not gonna go
anywhere and they're gonna say it nice
and defined all day long so once my
eyebrows are all laid and in place and
my eyelids are all primed and ready to
go for shadow and of course gonna do the
eyes and for today's like I'm gonna use
the brand new morphe 15 D which is the
day Slayer palette I'm first gonna grab
the shade in the crease on my m5 13
brush and put that shade in the crease
Alexa use the m-43 3 brush in the shade
editor and use that to deepen up the
crease and the outer corner add my
Sephora makeover my artists use to
Sephora Pro palette in the warm tones
and iMac makeover she used individual
shadows and in my ultimate career use
the Anasazi of Modern Renaissance
palette I thought oh so for the actual
color of this eye look none of the
makeovers actually were that accurate to
the original I feel like all three of
them turned out very very red in the end
whereas this look is obviously super
super Orange which is a little bit weird
I remember at the Sephora makeover the
eyeshadow look was actually done really
really well but the gold shadow used for
the actual lid was just a really strange
color that didn't match very well my Mac
makeover I think was the best eye shadow
look overall it looked very very
beautiful and well blended and then my
ultimate go but I felt like my artist
used the closest technique to the
original but it was just a really really
weird crease shape I mix it up I might
add 1 to 4 which is just a small Packer
brush and dip into the shade mob and use
this to deepen up that outer V the nerd
scenario IM four three three one more
time for my last step and go over those
edges to make sure that there are no
harsh lines
they're gonna grab the brand-new morphia
cream shadow in the shade of bronze this
from the new holiday clucks and you guys
have to check these out and I'm gonna
use that to card out the land and then
just add a little bit more glitter to
make it pop I'm gonna grab the Urban
Decay heavy metal liquid at glitter
liner and just pop a tiny bit of that on
the lid when it came to the actual lid
my altar artist was the only one who
actually embraced the whole half cut
crease type of situation which was
definitely going on in the Jacqueline
photo but even still all three artists
only use it by eye shadow for the actual
base I found that a little bit weird
because in the photo of Joplin you can
definitely tell that there is a little
bit of a glitter situation going on I
was disappointed in the lid situation to
all three different locations especially
Sephora and Ulta because the steel in
liquid metals things are sold in both
locations and those are so beautiful I
use those for almost all my cut crease
and they're extremely glittery as well
so I do wish something a little bit more
glittery or true to the original photo
was used so that is why we're going
extra glam today for the lower lash 7
person to grab 4-3-3 brush and the shade
editor and just buff that in and then
just using a I'm 513 brush that I had my
original transition shade on I'm gonna
go over those edges to make sure they
are really really blended out I'm then
gonna grab an Abbott one five one brush
into the shade mauve and I'm going to
use is to hug at the waterline and then
I'm just gonna line my lower waterlines
that I using they're pretty vulgar
pencil and obviously the nude shade I
definitely like a good new water line if
I was like it opens up the eye a lot so
now that the eye is all done the next up
is obviously going to be the eyelashes
and for today I picked up through the
Billy washes in the style Doha I feel so
these are the closest pair that I have
that looks close to what Jacqueline was
wearing so I'm just gonna pop on this
one today for my Sephora makeover I was
given a Sephora brand lash for my Mac
makeover I was given a Mac brand lash
and for my ultimate go Vern I had it in
our Dell brand lash all the lashes were
actually applied perfectly like the
artists all had a really good knowledge
of how to apply that right to the lash
line and how to make the glue like knock
it I'll walkie and Sun to my eye clearly
I don't have that knowledge because I'm
having a lot of trouble putting this on
right now lashes are semi Lisa a part of
my makeup routine because they're always
are really really wonky for you I don't
know what it is but I can just never get
okay example uh there were no gaps that
are comfortable to wear which is amazing
but I felt as though all three
lifestyles were not really that close to
the ones that Jacqueline had on and I
would definitely not choose to wear any
of them again
all right guys and that is when I all
complete I'm gonna go ahead and quickly
do the other one on off-camera to save
some time and I'll be right back to
finish off the rest of this look alright
guys and those are both eyes off
complete and the next up is going to be
of course deep blow before we go ahead
and actually play any how later today
I'm gonna play a light spread of these
skins a navy eye makeup finishing spray
I always like to apply a little bit of
setting spray before I apply my
highlighter just so it's really really
vibrant and of course you guys know I'm
gonna use my Anasazi illuminator and so
Hollywood and my morphe M 501 brush so
my artists at both Ulta and Sephora use
the chocolate health collaboration with
Becca cosmetics champagne pop
highlighter and I thought it was so cute
sense obviously this look it's a jump on
how inspired look and then my artist
that Mac used the soft and gentle
highlighter I thought my highly on all
three looks was decent they definitely
also had a little bit more vibrant I do
love a good glow and in the picture of
Jacqueline she is definitely like
blinding the haters left right with your
highlight which I love what I did think
was weird about the highlight for all
three lunches that all three artists use
a really really big brush for applying a
highlighter don't get me wrong I
definitely love a good doing in luck you
guys see me trying to achieve it all the
time but I do feel like there are places
the highlighter should be in place the
highlighter shouldn't be and because of
the size of the brush that all three
artists use I didn't feel like the
cheeks and like the under-eye region was
a little bit shinier than I typically
like it when it comes to holiday the
dose I'm gonna once again to grab that
tiny pencil brush and just draw a really
really thin line onto the tip and then
down the nose bridge once again going
back to the contour thing you guys know
I love a pinched nose and to achieve
that with makeup it definitely takes a
lot of different steps one of them is
definitely using a really really tiny
brush
obviously Holly is gonna bring the eye
forward and draw attention to it so by
using a pencil brush you're just
furthering the illusion and the only
artist that did that was my Mac artist
Helen and it was so amazing and I
thought like her nose contours by far at
the best and then finally to finish off
this look today I'm gonna go into the
Kat Von D liquid lipstick in the shade
Vampira when I first saw the photo of
Jacqueline this was the first liquid
lipstick to come to my head I feel so it
is totally a perfect match to the photo
so I was so excited to see my Sephora
artist playing this oh that my Mac
artist used the carnivorous liquid
lipstick from
the Mac and my Alta artist he was the
anasazi logo that was in the shade trust
but then again we remember I picked that
one up from a band not him and yes what
I'm applying this I'm making sure to
over line while applying this I did go
ahead and add two coats because as you
remember it in the Sephora video and
even looking in it right now
this lipstick is a little bit streaky so
I did want to make sure to get it super
super opaque and then finally last but
not least I'm gonna finish this off
using the skin to Navy eye makeup
finishing spray alright guys and that is
the beauty guru gets a makeover at his
own beauty station look all complete
here's the finished look now that you
guys have seen my version with all my
favorite techniques and products let's
go ahead and compare all four looks my
first makeover was at Sephora and my
artist was named crystal she was so so
sweet my makeover ended up costing me
$50 and they rated it a seven out of ten
my artists did a really really great job
and this makeover was a little bit
different for the other ones in the
series because it was the first episode
and I wasn't asking for specific things
like notes contour and for less harsh
bronzer and stuff like that so I don't
want to knock her too hard although I
did dislike the foundation I thought it
so it wasn't really that full coverage
and I felt as though some of the
eyeshadow tones were a little bit off
from the original my next makeover was
that Mac my artist was Helen it cost me
$60 and I rated this makeover an 8 out
of 10 my artists had been working at Mac
for over 10 years and her expertise
really really showed her blending was
absolutely impeccable I love the eye
shadow on this look although I do wish
she added a little bit more setting
powder because I started to get very
very oily very quickly and I felt as
though I was getting some creases and
she also underlined my lips which I felt
wasn't really that flattering to my face
shape my next night cover was at Ulta my
artist was Darrell it cost me once again
$60.00 that I ended up writing this
makeover a 7 out of 10 I really liked
this makeover in the sense that he used
a lot of the same products and
techniques that I usually use in my
normal routine such as Too Faced Born
This Way Foundation and turn shape tape
although there was some weird things
that the pink of the foundation shade
was nowhere near my skin tone once I
left the store but that's like a whole
lighting situation that I don't even
want to get into and then of course my
cut crease was a little bit of a really
really wonky shape that I don't think
flattered my eyes
now that we've compared all the details
of all for makeovers let's compare them
side by side first we went to Sephora
then he went to Mac then was Ulta and
then finally my own work looking at all
four of these books next to each other
it is so cool to see all the different
techniques and products to use but all
the different artists even though we
went into each experience with the same
exact photo I think it is the race so
cool that each look looks very very
different and unique in their own ways
there are things that I love on each
look and there are also things that I
don't love as much but overall I think
all three makeovers were a huge success
in the end taking into consideration the
final look techniques use products use
prices and just treatment overall I
think my grand prize winner for this
makeover finale is Mac getting a Mac
makeover I felt incredibly comfortable
the entire time my artist was super kind
it was definitely extremely
knowledgeable about the makeup process
which obviously you want if you're
getting a glam makeover well $60 wise on
the higher end of the price tags for the
makeovers I felt as though I was
definitely paying for expertise I feel
as though the things that I didn't like
as much about the look being the lack of
setting powder and the underlined lips
are two things that can really easily be
fixed by simply saying something
obviously you guys watching this know
that I tried to stay as little as
possible just to see what the artist
would come up with on their own but
obviously if you're gonna get makeup
done you should speak up because any
artist is being paid to paint your face
and to make you look good so you should
be getting what you want as a client
even though Mac was my personal winner
today I definitely wanna hear from you
guys which out of the four looks was
your favorite did you like the Sephora
look the Mac look the Ulta look or my
look at the best leave me a comment down
