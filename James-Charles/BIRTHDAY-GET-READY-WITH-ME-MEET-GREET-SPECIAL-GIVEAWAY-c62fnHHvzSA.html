to our YouTube channel as you can see
I'm in a very very different setup
tonight and I am in my beauty room of
Harvard who are coming soon and by the
way nice been getting so many comments
about it
definitely a keep your eyes peeled but
yes creating my being room today we are
not in the normal studio setup and that
is because today is a very very special
video is May 23rd marking this be the
18th year from which I was born
it's so crazy I know a legal adult and
it takes all my bios to announce an 18
year old kid with healthy blending
brushes and now here it is a very very
special day if you guys are following me
for a while you know that I'm not really
a party animal I don't really drink or
definitely don't do any drugs and I've
just basically my own business tenants
they all do my thing but I really have
anything crazy plan for today is a
special event so because I decided to do
a mean green when I hear a convict in
the entire world
more feet so today I'm using a get ready
with me at style video for my birthday
glam and I'm gonna take you guys with me
instead of angry so lunch of blog
footage have a wonderful time and then
stay tuned for the end of the video
because I have a very very special
announcement regarding a contents on
I'll be holding in honor of 1 million on
YouTube to land on Instagram as my 18th
birthday so if you guys don't see how I
get ready for my birthday glam just keep
on watching
I first gonna pop in my schedule instant
white time a lot of people will ask me
how do you get in a contact you have
nails my interview is carefully I'm
gonna be probably my faces might benefit
Porefessional primer as always I'm going
beating him Redick for three hours you
just want to make sure my face is locked
all the way to place
I honestly solve excited I barely are
ready to do gracious because they're
always so happy and so crazy and very
very honest and as well so I'm super
excited that I get to do it at morphe of
all places says y'all know sister James
who loves her more 3d I feel like I've
literally been at 17 forever this year
we're so slow but there were like so
many amazing things that happened and so
many not so many things to look I'm so
thankful for you guys that I'd like
stuff to me to see
tear things I'm a human being I'm
growing up soiling amplicons is industry
super super quickly I really are amazing
I'm so thankful for everything that I've
accomplished and achieved and all of
your life but at the same time it
definitely pushed me to learn it and
educate myself very very quickly I
definitely made a lot of mistakes and as
I said a lot of things that I shouldn't
have fun I think that it's important to
know that as human beings we all make
mistakes Annette the only thing you can
do with colourfully you have to go back
is just grow and better your public
person I'm so critical with this year
has to hold a propellant Egon there are
a lot of really really cool things that
are happening right now behind the
things that I can't talk to you about
just yet but gospel idiot keep your eyes
peeled because I'm working on a lot I'm
just really so good to work I feel as I
was already super super motivated
beforehand but not moving to LA
everybody here has like a major ejective
everybody here has something to do and
living here - Julie pushed me to work so
hard to be the best version of myself
and just get a whole lot of up I
feel like I'm up off that bitch would
have here and I absolutely love it oh my
god I just associated for you guys to
see it what's like what's coming I don't
think I'm no idea what makeup I'm doing
today I'm just starting with my face and
we'll figure it out later on I feel like
when I'm taking a lot of pictures ready
to do really really light makeup but at
the same time like I kinda wanna go-o-o
but you know I do not want to do I'm
definitely not having any good skin day
today which is annoying because out of
all days today would be the ones at
Harvard because I able to pour my life
bar I was up so they left and all the
sisters they all came over and subscribe
me has been their little it is so cute
and like a friend at canvas - it keeps
us we all child it down I said the
school's render the eternal that I'm so
so happy
I remember as a child for going to do
the 80s so badly and now that I'm
actually here we think it like exactly
the same I offend how every birthday
work obviously but I didn't remember
being like oh my god I want to be 18 so
that I could be illegal I don't do all
these fun things but like now actually
being here like I don't do anything
anyway
it's so crazy because I've been living
alone for a few months now and I started
living on a 17 I graduated early age
across the country which is something
that a lot of people can't even say when
they're 18 or 19 so I'm so like I think
I've always been very like ahead of my
age and older inside than I was on my
birth certificate I guess that sounds so
stupid left and it really is this you're
my only thing I was like a lot of older
people I don't I feel like I'm a lot
more mature than a lot of kids that are
my age and I think it's really really
cool to be where I am
I guess the only real exciting part of
Austin I guess now I cannot legally have
a grinder how about let's be real
I'm not going to do anything anyway so
for my brows I'm gonna use the ax
benefit persistent brow pencil in the
shade number four on spoon to lightly
fill them in and sculpt them
I'm so excited for the next upcoming
week I go home back to New York with all
the sisters for my student graduation
and I am so beyond excited I opened up a
package my parents Esther day at for my
birthday and they maybe like a Sulha
bump a bunch of like old @q baby photos
in it and photos from like sites friends
and stuff
and I just started bawling I don't cry
like ever but I'm opening that package
just really put it in perspective how
much I missed them so much I have been
wanting to like move out and just kind
of be independent or and long as I can
remember we've returned those careers
over some of my old apartment
and like if you ask my mom she will tell
you the joy boys then super super
independent but now that I actually live
alone I can't even explain how much I
miss my mom and things she would do for
me I really do miss her a lot to times I
don't make up for some reason my brows
keep coming out really really uneven and
it's really starting to get on my last
nerve
I don't know what is going on but one
side of the table it looks a lot like
better than the other one forgiving
father Jean because I'm so good to go
back over blonde for graduation the only
bad part about it is that it's the same
weekend at VidCon and I won't be able to
go so I'll have a meeting so many treats
are you guys asking I'm going to be
there and no I will not be at this
year's VidCon I will however we play
succeed VidCon happens expand exactly
after graduation and unfortunately I
cannot stand back but I am working with
a really really iconic designer to do
something super super cool my graduation
gown so definitely it stay tuned for
that because you guys are definitely
going to want to see that if you will be
it shift to the core in honor today is
morphine gravities these that is my
hotel of course - it's like my eyes
musical change for 10% off I'm going to
go something really light airy and
joking today just because a lot of times
in ten single books do not photograph
that well for me reads in some ways to
look good every photo
Laura does we do not need another
flashback marry mean with situation
that's the other life obviously I cannot
find my match says there so I guess
reviews i packaged up with us today to
come to you
good evening me Lily Washington's cloud
my head for today and lovely blushes so
frickin much these are definitely in my
top three like I said before a long time
as my iconic support in my Bella new
battle zone or might not help it I just
like they're so pretty like really
natural looking like I have wash
attention but I don't have to like go
through the household with wanting to
rip my eyes operation event with lots of
tension that's 20 vote for a nude lip
today that's going to last me all day
long so not I'm going to mewni Kat Von
D's bow and arrow and as you watched my
how to find your perfect liquid fistic
shades using your hot dogs you know that
this is one of the final three that one
and there's a definite oh my all-time
favorite way to finish off this book
once and from when use my Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray every time
before we really need to select all day
long all sweat all the hugs and all the
makeup brushes
and then a monster alright guys this is
the completed makeup look I'm going to
go to put on my all but now honestly I'm
not exactly sure what I'm gonna wear yet
