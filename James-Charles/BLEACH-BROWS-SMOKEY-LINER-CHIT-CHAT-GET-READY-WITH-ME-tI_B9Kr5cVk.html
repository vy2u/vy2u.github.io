mediate liens and complicate the funny
I can release the cash watch slowly hi
guys
Jean Charles here welcome back to my
youtube channel it has been a hot minute
yes I see the lipstick on my teeth this
is what happens when you are legally
blind you were too lazy to buy a monitor
and you think you can do everything with
gesture if you find her let this be a
lesson to everybody you can't so don't
try hope you guys enjoy the video I've
been able to just sit down relax have a
good time and create something
absolutely awesome for you guys
October was so wild with all the
covergirl stuff and obviously the
Halloween tutorials I hope you guys did
mind they were all avoid summer but it
had to be done order to get videos out
and I was not about to not have any
videos on Halloween month now things
have finally calmed down so I can
finally like sit down relax to a fully
chitchat type video with you guys so
that is exactly what I did today I did a
chit chat get ready with me with these
editorial glam bleached brow makeup look
wow that's a mouthful we cut it out
that's all that matters I really love
how this turned out when I was in LA a
few weeks ago one of my best friends
Cassie did my makeup she did bleach
brows and I fell in love so I really
wanted to recreate them today on this
look and what I came up with so if you
guys want to see how I created this and
just chitchat have a good time learn
about some new products in my life in
general make sure you would keep on
watching I'm going to start on today as
always by priming my face easily benefit
Porefessional primer holy crap I'm so
here it is just like sit down and talk
to you guys today I've been doing
voiceovers for so long because of
Halloween and how busy I've been but it
feels so good to be able to like sit
down just have a little chit chat get
ready than you type of video I'm then
going into this Mac concealer on my
morphe r32 brush and just patting this
all over the surface of my nose I think
I've talked about this before in a video
I honestly do not remember so I guess
I'll just maybe edit this out if I have
or maybe not it's really not that deep
but this is like a good trick to how to
make kind of a second layer underneath
your foundation because y'all know that
I've had issues with my nose to say the
least for a foundation today I'm gonna
be saying goodbye to my makeup forever
and I'm going to try not the new la girl
pro coverage foundation I love it get it
open
I love the LA girl concealers they are
by far one of the best concealer on the
market in my opinion so I have very very
high hopes for this foundation hopefully
it looks nice and I'm just gonna apply
this with a damp Beauty sponge onto my
face okay instant friends thought is
that this applies very nicely like this
feels really really good I honestly do
not really like liquid foundations I'm
not the biggest fan of them they
oftentimes look pretty crappy on my skin
so I'm definitely not going to jump to
any conclusions here I am going to like
give you guys the full rundown at the
end of the video probably but I honestly
really really like this so far just for
reference as well I'm in the shade of
fair I have the white one here just in
case I needed to mix but this is
actually a pretty good match for my skin
tone so I will be needing it today
this is obviously perfect for my pale
beauties out there so deadly check this
out as well LA girls always been around
that has a lot of darker shades too so
neighbor representation sticking with
the theme of la girl today I'm going
ahead and applying the LA girl Pro
concealer on the highlights of my face
this is like I said definitely my
favorite consistency concealers so I
really do love this one and then of
course I'm going to blend it out with my
damp Beauty Blender as always okay well
this foundation is really really got my
skin like oh wow I really girl they
really did that so I'm going to go ahead
and set my face as always using my Ocoee
respond powder a lot of the videos i've
done have definitely featured a lot of
the same products which is why i
definitely want to switch it up and try
out some new ones in this video but this
powder is definitely like one of my
cannot live it up i feel like there is
no setting powder that can do my face
justice like the kodi one does to
further brighten up my face I'm using my
Mac Studio Fix Foundation and I think
and 3 yep and my morphe e49 brush I'm
just putting this like in the same
places that I put my concealer just to
kind of bring everything up and to
provide a little bit more coverage this
look is going to be super duper glam
I guess yeah so I really want that full
coverage contoured chiseled
round-faced just put the foundation on
James to bond today i'm gonna be using
the middle shade of the kat von d shade
and light palette in my morphe and 5 to
7 brush and i'm just going to begin to
put this on the cheekbones like I said
are going up pretty heavy on the bronzer
in contour today I really want this to
be a full beatdown glam and to divide a
little bit more I'm going to mix
together the side two shades of the same
palette and my Murphy and 5:30 brush and
I'm just going to run that in the really
hollows of I'm just going to contour a
little bit more can absolutely not
forget to contour this I've had needs to
be slim down just a little bit and then
a right below the jaw as well to make
sure it is super cut to contour my nose
today I'm going to be using the same
exact palette in my JD Wade a 180 Luxy
182 brush that is a mouthful it is
phenomenal literally has saved the life
of my nose contour well I guess not
actually because you guys were all
rating me on my last video but I'll be
honest my nose contour definitely did
not look the best I promise I figured
out how to make it look really really
bombed for photos like super snatched
super cinched super tiny for photos in
real life but I have very different
lighting for my videos and I do for my
pictures so it is a totally different
situation that I am still trying to
learn please bear with me
it'll be good eventually I did notice
that the LA girl foundation wasn't
pulling a little bit off of my nose so
I'm just being super gentle and I'm
gonna grab a movie - one two brush right
back into that back foundation powder
and I'm going to draw a very tiny line
right down the bridge of my nose and to
finish off the face I'm just going to go
back into my Coty or some powder and
bake I'm also bringing this powder onto
at the sides of the bridge of the nose
this will really help keep that contour
in place
all right I'm just calling this sit for
a few minutes like I said I really want
this to be full glam so I'm going to go
get nice and baked oh wow not that way
don't do drugs
I'll be right back all right I'm back
hello I hope you missed me I missed you
all too
moving along my next time one really do
you doing my brows but I really want to
do a bleached brows today so I'm going
to actually begin with my eyes shocking
I know but I think we can make it Tahoe
I'm just turning off by priming my
eyelids using my morphe e45 brush and my
la girl Pro concealer again then I'm
just going to set it in place with
powder just to like an eyeshadow base I
obviously am NOT going to actually bleed
my brow so I'm gonna be showing you guys
how to do it today with like normal
makeup products I just did a shoot with
my best friend in the entire world
Cassy Mui she is so talented she did
this amazing look on me and we did a
bleach brows part and it literally
looked so good so I really want to try
them again tonight and see what I can do
or if I can even do a period I guess
we'll find out so good so for my shadow
for my shadows today I'm going to using
my morphe 35 K palette this is a really
great alternative if you can't catch the
35 oh I know Minnesota all the time
remember as well you can use the code
James for 10% of all of your brushes and
products they're all bombs hell I'm
going to use my m1 5/8 this is actually
a broad brush but it is really crusty
right now I definitely need to wash my
brushes I've been traveling a lot
recently so I have not got a chance but
it's an angled liner brush is the point
and I'm going to doing some smoky liners
debate somewhat this will be absolutely
perfect I'm going to dip into this dark
brown shade right here in the corner
then similar to regular winged liner I'm
just going to sketch out the bottom line
going from the outer corner I'm also
going to try to put this Brown over the
krusty lash glue that is now apparently
living in my eyelashes at all given
times this is the life of a makeup
artist I'm not going to dip into this
later brown shade right up in here with
my Alexia 141 brush this is just a mini
pencil brush and I'm going to use this
to start smoking out this liner
then I'm just going to take this out of
five six - which apparently already has
some color on it are you really that
surprised because I'm certainly not and
I'm going to use this to then diffuse
that line just a little bit more and
then taking a clean ish m42 3:30 and
blending that out as well I'm just going
to take the same brush and dip into the
Block in the bottom corner and just to
find it a little bit more up being
really careful though because we don't
want this to be like overpowering I'm
also I'm also going to carefully tie
line with missing thing yeah before
going onto the lower lash line with
shadow I'm going to use my NYX jumbo eye
pencil in white to line the waterline
another reason that angle brush to kind
of sketch out a new lashline with that
way in the waterline when I get to the
inner corner here with the shadow I'm
kind of taking this and like flaking it
almost a little bit downwards this is
just going to really open up the eyes
and elongate them as well and then just
going to take that Lexy pencil brush
again in the lighter brown shade from
the 35k and begin to buff out that light
a little bit well link it to the outer
corner as well I'm kind of pushing the
bottom lashline shadow yeah inglis James
right into the top liner to fade
everything together I'm going to curl my
lashes for mascara say I'm going to be
using the new covergirl soul ashy masca
this obviously has a very special place
in my heart if you don't follow me or
you haven't been paying attention lately
I'm surprised because I literally have
not stopped talking about it but this is
the mascara I work on covergirl with
this is the campaign that began me as a
covergirl so it's very very cool and it
is a very great mascara so I'm just
going to complete coat the lashes before
we apply some falsies
what all this happened since I had lost
20 goes oh my god I was on Ellen duh I
was like definitely one of the closest
friends is of my entire life it was so
much fun
Ellen was so nice like I was talking
about covergirl the new mascara my life
as a high school student so definitely
like one of the coolest days literally
ever I have yet to actually see the on
lip or the actual commercial airing I
have 20 my closest friends over for a
viewing party of the Ellen episode and
of course there was a presidential
emergency broadcast during it so the
actual episode of Ellen didn't come on
until David Blaine a new sharing an
episode with him was not a good idea
because apparently David Blaine decided
to make my appearance on Helen disappear
so thanks man yeah oh by the way these
are Lily washes in the style Cannes
Kane CA N and he s I don't know how to
pronounce them alright guys that is what
I all complete I'm going to go and do
the other one
first we don't waste a million years and
then we can go ahead and get started on
the rest of the face and the bleach
brows BRB I forgot to trim these lashes
and I honestly don't really want to
because they're so pretty but now I'm
immediately ready for how they're today
I'm going to grab Oprah's Rodeo Drive on
my morphe ab 501 brush as usual and I'm
going to get the glove on
oh my god I forgot how much I love this
highlighter it's so pretty
whoo from the reminder as well that you
can use code Jay Charles for 30% of all
products that Oprah they're liquid
lipsticks as you guys know we're
definitely one of my favorite for most
all-time so I would doesn't recommend
and clearly the Tyler is also a bomb as
hell to highlight my nose but I'm going
to go into my m21 to the same tiny brush
that I used before
well not the same one this one is clean
but it's the same brush okay you know
what I mean and I'm just going to draw a
really thin line down the tip of my nose
my look today I'm going to use this
beautiful lipstick from Shu a in the
shade cerise it's just this like red
lipstick I've been over drawing my lips
a lot lately and honestly I really
really like how it looks it is one of my
definite favorite makeup techniques now
but for some reason I can literally
never get out on my first try like I
always have to clean something up with a
concealer I always just get bigger and
bigger and bigger it's so much I'm like
why can't I just get it right you know
Oh first world problems okay so me being
me I have the urge to add focus to this
look and I think it will look cute once
we bleach out the brows so I'm going to
grab my morphe m2400
and my benefit cabral gel in the shade
at number 3 and start to add those n I
do have an in-depth video on my channel
and how I do my Frank freckles so if you
want to see how you should definitely
check that out but something I've been
doing recently that I did not show in
the video is when I contour my nose and
I draw a freckles on as well I'll kind
of use those freckles to outline the
nose contour and I just furthers the
illusion that my nose is like skinny
mini and not like oh I think it actually
has
to begin bleaching at the brows I'm
going to take some of the la girl Pro
concealer in orange and some of my
normal color Elle I'm going to mix them
together to kind of create like a peachy
more color correcting type of shade okay
so that definitely did not work out I
just use a little bit of tissue paper to
get that out of my brow we're going to
try something else I'm going to take my
buy buy on drive for me at cosmetics and
my sigma e60 to brush and kind of try to
do the same situation I guess this
concealers like industrial-strength so
this might work a little bit better okay
this is working a little bit better
okay yes hello hi so my dumb ass forgot
to explain what I was doing here so I'm
going to hop in - voiceover quickly all
I did was put a little bit of a squirt
of concealer on the back of my hand and
then run a disposable spoolie through
that little like pile then all I did was
just comb to the brows it works so well
so do this instead of wasting your time
moving on now to a job decide this in
place I'm going to grab my Mac Studio
Fix foundation again
and this random flat shader brush from
iconic London and I'm going to really
carefully Oh God
put this on this is not as easy as I was
hoping it would be how did Cassie to
that I think this is the best we're
going to get given the fact that my
brows are like a plat caterpillar's but
we did the best we could with the
concealer and powder I really love this
look so let's go ahead and finish it off
well my eyebrows are still wet
unintentionally obviously my guess is
we're going to have to do with I think I
want to match the wetness on my lips and
give myself some gloss so I'm going to
go into the Mac of amplified lip gloss
in the shade it suggests it and just pop
this right over top of my lips oh wow so
much yes alright guys and that is the
completed bleached brow glam makeup
swirl I love how this look turned out
what do you guys think about the bleach
brows let me know in the comments down
below I personally love how they look I
definitely cannot speak for everybody
else though I figure I might get some
really crazy looks if I walk down the
street with useful honestly who even
cares I'm sorting like editorial runway
realness and I am living for it if
