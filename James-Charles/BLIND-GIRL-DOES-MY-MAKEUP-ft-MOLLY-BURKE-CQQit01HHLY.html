a while when you look at me you're like
just a basic girl but no there's a lot
more than meets the eye huh see what I
did there or doesn't meet the eye
exactly love that you're already rolling
the blind Oaks we like people who can do
that right getting right into it so I
make videos here on the tubes about
pretty much just like life as a blind
person I'm a fashion and beauty lover
the beauty community is what like got me
into you - that is so cool way back when
I lost my vision in 2008 so yeah I'm
just like so happy way to finally make
this happen
these are constantly tweeting me telling
me that I need to collab with you so we
don't reached out I was like dying a
little inside oh my god I'm so excited
you guys we're doing it so many cool
things today for my channel Bali's gonna
do my makeup Clem lately blinds clearly
and I have so many things that I want I
don't even need a blindfold so easy and
then for my channel Molly's gonna
challenge me and I'm gonna have to do
her makeup completely Vitaphone still
gonna be like trading lifestyle I just
have so many questions well just let me
actually wanted to like feel and play
through all my makeup and I was like
you're all at war so down instead of me
just giving her the products to put my
face we're gonna make her pick through
them as well and it was so crazy because
I was cleaning out my makeup table
before I even started and she was
telling me what all my apartments like
oh this is perfect oh this is Mac Paint
Pot I'm so crazy like the obsession is
so deep I like I always ask me like you
can't even see makeup you can't even see
fashion why do you like it so much and
I'm always like going blind doesn't
change who you are
it should know how you live and so it
just had to change like how I do things
you know like I'm still Molly I still
love tattoos I still love fashion I
still love makeup even though I can't
see it
my favorite color is still purple even
though I can't see it you know what I
mean no literally so cool I have so many
things that I want to ask you so I feel
like we should just jump right into the
video because I'm so pumped let's do
this girl let's do it
and Bernie you have several plastic
drawers that are built goodness beauty
blenders yeah mac fix+
yes we do oh you know what her dual
awesome blank fake lashes
oh my goodness are these foundations yes
there are these all gonna be the right
shade no so I won't okay now would be to
struggle yeah
are these the two Facebooks yes I'm
telling you I know my makeup I love
problem this is the Laura Mercier it is
but are these concealers yes these are
all the exact same are these tart yes
shape tape yes Oh
benefit yes which one is it though I'm
just gonna have to like literally
blindly pick what do we have it here is
this Too Faced yes how did you even know
the box was on I'm scared
yes but can I tell would you call this
peach okay so think of very like like
Mac no yeah you can tell by the texture
protip this is benefit brow product yes
it is are we getting into the single
shadows these are glitters any loose
glitter
sounds dangerous with blowing this
sounds like more blind man I love you
what there's like just one lonely like
no product that's glitter or gel this is
the most insane thing it's weird and it
dries down to I used it for Coachella
can you see the light reflection for me
yes so cool I love anything glittery and
anything metallic because when the light
hits it I can see it oh this is dose
dose of color yeah it is what can I say
this is obviously an R as one yes
I think I'm gonna go with this okay the
one that like the most reflective - well
thought this middle one is very it's
part of you what color tone is it it's
like a kind of like champagne you tone
okay oh Lord
yeah let's do it can I feel both no
broken but it's so good and does her job
Wow you loved this yeah it was a good
one geez you really went ham before we
start doing this obviously you're blind
yes right so you're gonna do my makeup I
have no idea what you look yep
I want you to describe to me what you
think I look like well immediately when
I came in and I gave you a hug yeah I
was like he's exactly around the height
that I pictured you to be and you're the
builds like even like your shoulder
width you're more of like a slim and on
the shorter side like I pictured you
being around between like five six and
like five nine and being like kind of a
slimmer build okay that's just how I
pictured by the way I pictured you to
have like really good hair and brows
yeah like hey star point is like what I
picture you and I know you're you're
pretty into you're like full glam yeah
so I picture to have like good strong
cheekbones strong brows I would picture
you to have like a very symmetrical face
I've been told that I do have that yeah
at least if I don't my face doing it to
look like that song I picture you to be
like a deeper skin tone than me but
still Caucasian no I don't picture to
have freckles I have a few actually I
wish I had a trackhoe freckles I have
Beauty works all over my face they're
not liking nicely cutely place right on
the bridge of the nose which is where I
wish they were I have freckles there
yeah you guys are the best
and then I pictured up brown eyes yes
wow yeah I'm impressed with my own self
yeah no Molly that's awesome
this might be a worker so but you want
to feel my face before you begin okay
first before we do that yeah I will say
that like typically blind people don't
feel faces so somebody like me wants to
like meet a lot if you meet me in person
if you meet a blind person in person
don't be like what you want to feel my
face they didn't like no no but in this
situation it does make more sense yes I
will be doing a lot of your makeup with
my hands that's because that's how I do
my makeup because I can feel what I'm
doing yeah
a brush puts a barrier between what I'm
doing right so of course those things
that I'm gonna use brushes for like I'm
not gonna like try to contour with my
finger you know but like a lot of them
the other stuff I do like to use my
fingers to apply stuff right because it
does give me a good feel but like yeah I
don't know what face shape you have I
don't know you know that that kind of
stuff so we're moving makeup it changes
things right so if this is a pore
filling primer it's gonna be very slick
yep yep thick and slick 'sister
definitely needs some more help
oh I can feel your little stubble yeah
my facial hair goes back in like five
seconds flat which is so annoying would
you get wig please or hair I want it
really badly yeah I'm working on that
just for the like purpose of makeup yeah
yeah move canvas every day you have such
like a man's brow line yeah yeah I
definitely have a pretty masculine face
yeah for sure I feel like I have like a
very strong jaw line which I feel like
is more masculine as well I feel like a
masculine dawn on a woman can give like
that model ask type of luck which is
really good well thank you so question
for you you do your makeup every single
day I do but because you lost your
vision when you were 14 14 you don't
remember what you look like I don't but
it's insane to me yes it's one of the
like most frustrating things like most
of my blind friends when you talk to
them they like it sounds so narcissistic
like if you could see something you'd
want to see your family your friends and
yourself like you just wanna see faces
yes like you missed so much when you
can't see they say more than 90% of
communication is nonverbal of course
it's a tone of voice but it's also
facial expression body language all of
that stuff means a lot it's hard not
being able to see other people when
you're communicating with them it's hard
not to see yourself it can be difficult
especially when you're like working in
the entertainment business you're living
in LA with all the pretty people and
it's very much a place based on life and
you get so many comments cuz like of
course I work in social media so I get
like tons of comments about my parents
it can really screw with your head yeah
but I really try to not think about it
and just like be positive because it's
really easy to focus on the negative
parts of being blind yeah but there's
also positives that come with it
yeah they're not as easy they're not as
obvious but I think if I live with like
thinking of the sad stuff that's no way
no point right you just sit back
cry all the time like I like that no
okay I don't know poke you in the eye no
worries
perfect I was watching everybody oh that
you do is saying yes you don't really
have a lot of recollection of much of
anything yeah so like visual memory
doesn't really last my mom her best
friend an actual boss is blind he lost
his vision on his 11th birthday on his
11th birthday yeah what again absolutely
horrible right obviously I'm very
ignorant to the topic I know a little
bit but I write pretty much ignorant to
the topic of blindness that's why I'm so
excited to learn more from you today he
has a 1 2 3 was 11 he is much older now
but he can remember a lot of things I
wonder if he actually remembers or if
it's his brain well I will tell you Fred
he grew up in New York City he still
works there all the time for his job and
what's insane to me is obviously when
you're blind a lot of your other senses
are of course you rely on the more yeah
we will be in the taxi together in New
York and he'll be like oh my god look at
that building over there on 56th and
Madison it's so beautiful and I'll look
over bleak oh yeah that is a pretty
building they don't remember oh my god
he has no idea what he's looking at or
he'll be like oh yeah look at there's
the subway station right there like
that's where we need to go so he can't
see I think I I have that too like I
have mental maps of everything around me
take me to a shopping mall I know where
every store is located in the mall and I
can like walk directly there like it's
like a mental mapping system like it's a
coping mechanism yeah we have to
remember where everything is and I'll
talk about things like a lot of people
come and be like well how does she know
like that's her favorite foundation if
she can't see how it looks and like it's
about how it feels or like talked about
something as if I know how beautiful is
I'm never like how does she talk about
it like she knows how beautiful it is
I'm like what people describe it to me
yeah unified a fluffy brush to set you
with I hate brushes are soft you might
love
I like the fluffy soft ones oh yeah yeah
that's a good one is it dual fibre yes
laura mercier yes ma'am I did this like
series on my channel where I started
trying beauty products and beauty hacks
that I was too scared to try oh my god
and one of them was loose setting
powders that's thing that you've been
afraid to try I was always afraid
because like loose powder and blindness
sounds like a dangerous combination
there's two base has a loose powder it's
their peach powder and I literally love
it because I thought smell like pee it
tastes like peach - oh my god like I'll
be putting it on in like someone like
land on my tongue like you and then I'm
like I actually taste something you're
gonna show me that product I a hundred
percent well have I gotten any no nope
not much oh I just talked product over
blind girl problems are you able to
visualize things yeah it's interesting
it's almost like when people describe
things because I have like a history
with sight yeah even though I can't like
pull up an image when you describe stuff
it still means something okay
more so than it would to somebody who's
never seen right so if I said like oh
you're using a white handled duo-fiber
fluffy brush like it's like a far-off
it's almost like a memory like yeah I
can still remember green purple and blue
because I see them all the time I have
what's called like I called him
fireworks um and basically I see
flashing lights 24/7 and they're only
blue green and purple
but he said purple is your favorite
color purple is my favorite color was
the last favorite color I after I had
when I was going blind so it's just like
remained my favorite color oh my god all
right I'm gonna bronze you one of the
reasons I love to face so much is
because their products are scented it's
so it's like I can enjoy it you know
like I can't see it but I can smell it
and it's like a way for me to enjoy
makeup so this would be like the dumbest
question ever but since you don't have
your sight what would be your favorite
scents um that's a stupid question God
it's not um I say my hands are my eyes
yeah I'm always going around touching
everything yeah except people's faces
and so that's like definitely one of the
senses I rely on the most yeah I'm a nun
hearing yeah as I say my mom's boss he
carries around a walking cane and he can
slam his cane on the ground as soon as
he walks into her mine can tell
like a million Fox bought the room yeah
passive echolocation I'm gonna bless you
now I've never used this blush before so
I hope I'm not going to like
heavy-handed with it but that's what
happens when you can't see the colors
whenever I gotten your makeup on my
clothes now see how this one goes and I
always like ask somebody usually before
I leave the house to make it to make
sure I like FaceTime my mom yeah she's
like my honest mirror we all need an
honest people in our life like that yes
so do it alone I do yes you live alone
mm-hmm my mom has been living with me
since I moved to LA and she will be
heading home back to Canada on Wednesday
so just gonna be you and sister go up
yes oh my god gallops my guide dog yes
of course I the way are you nervous to
live alone I lived alone in Toronto for
two years oh okay I'm gonna guess
lightest to darkest no I can't stand why
do brands just randomly willy-nilly go
throwing colors into a lottery and it's
so annoying
it would make more sense not even just
for blind people but for like beginners
of makeup yeah if all makeup went in the
order of shades okay so you live alone
in Toronto for two years I did yes I
live alone right now
yeah very large apartment I am lonely
and it was yeah I was the same age as
you when I moved out yeah I was 18 I
lived on my own from 18 to 20 21
I am very people relying like me I need
to be around people at all times X
obviously yes yeah obviously not to see
but just like to feel like a presence
around you yeah yeah would you say that
gala would be like that presence for you
or if C was the dog I had at the time
okay
we live together she was great like she
would get me out going to dog park with
her and I you know I had a full-time
assistant at the time as a motivational
speaker I still haven't loved all but
that was like my full-time job was
national speaking so I was like touring
a lot and I had a full-time assistant
who would travel everywhere with me so
my parents lived close by and like would
come visit my dad's office was like 15
minutes away so yeah it made like living
alone
more PC versus like now I live six hour
flight away from my family which is
obviously like yeah a lot
you have to come to my place how do you
think I like it so far
I love it I honestly do I told my
parents when I was five that I was gonna
move to LA really like this is the same
all I became a youtuber so I moved to LA
like no it really like has always been
my dream I always say I want to fulfill
like all of sight at Molly's dreams you
know I want to show myself and other
people that going blind doesn't have to
change my life path and you have to
change everything it changes things for
sure but like it doesn't have to be like
that not to make it negative or anything
but like what would you say has been the
hardest part about not being sighted
you know I dealt with a lot of bullying
when it happened which was very hard I
lost all my friends and like went from
being like pretty popular to having just
not only happening nobody but being
tormented I know what's really really
hard oh my god like anymore because I
love my life
please do that's what I talk about a lot
with my speaking as like mental health
and bullying and accessibility and
accepting diversity and that kind of
thing because you know I think a lot of
people are very ignorant about blindness
and disability in general it's not their
fault it's because Society has been
taught that it should be this elephant
in the room and that we're not allowed
to talk don't look don't stare don't ask
questions right
ignore them you know that's not how I
think it should be we should be educated
and talking about it from a young age we
should have disabled characters in
children's books and in TV shows and it
shouldn't be like the sole focus of the
character all the time right no which is
unfortunately how it is we're rarely
represented in media and when we are
were represented very poorly I grew up
wanting to be an actress and a model but
I love blind I was like it's never gonna
happen yeah I realized like you know
maybe traditional media is gonna be
really hard for me to work in but like I
can carve my own path I can represent
myself I can represent my community yeah
and make content myself I would you say
YouTube's done the best platform for you
to do that oh my god absolutely I love
YouTube YouTube was like a huge part of
my journey to recovery and my journey to
finding confidence and self love after
blindness and so the fact that I can now
use YouTube to help other people is so
relatable yeah do you have a lot of
blind followers I do I definitely have a
lot of disabled followers a lot of blind
followers I have a lot of parents of
kids who are disabled yeah more teachers
but of course I also have like a ton of
able-bodied people know nothing about
disability and come and learn
and join the conversation and I love
that I love changing people's opinions
and like breaking stereotypes so many
people will initially come to my channel
and be like oh she's faking it cuz XYZ
like all of these stereotypes that I
don't fit right but then they watch
enough of my videos and they realize why
they're misinformed why they hold these
ideas about disability and why they
might be wrong yeah and actually like on
the process of like trying to catch me
alive they educate but it's all crazy to
me why would you ever do that there's
like those few rare random people who
have like faked cancer or like that guy
on twitch who like pretended to be in a
wheelchair and then stood up the end of
a nice victim I think there's those
weird bizarre random for at a few people
but they get attention when they do it
and it gets media attention when the
story comes out that like now everybody
who has cancer it's like they have to
prove it once they buck expose it on the
internet in everybody was disabled we
have to like prove it but that's not the
responsibility you know as it should be
it's the one bad person that ruins that
for everybody exactly that sucks
I feel like there's a lot of that in the
beauty community - like a lot of us have
had sister scandals and yeah I saw the
beauty community definitely has a very
like bad and like dramatic rap but well
I feel like it sucks but like I'm part
of the problem of that and the sense
that I definitely had a messy past
growing up but I've definitely clean it
up and I know a lot of other people as
well but that's you know you're so young
like making mistakes is a part of the
journey you know you learned so much I
mean I'm such a different person now
than I was at 20 and I thought I was
like mature and knew it all at 20 you
know you grow and that's a part of it
yeah and unfortunately like for somebody
like you who started in social media
very young you had to grow up publicly
and you like people have to see your
mistakes we all make mistakes and a lot
of us are lucky enough that we do it
privately right so I don't understand
like people who fill in eyes you know
young celebrities and stars who make
mistakes because it's like yeah you did
that too you know and you can't even
imagine the pressure right that these
people are under you have less brow bone
than me really yeah I have more you have
more Blancas higher yeah I brows are not
very arched they're like more coarse
it's not just a boy thing or is that
like are you think I guess it's a little
bit of a boy thing also my brows have
underwent a major transformation if you
were to meet me two years ago and he had
the square Brown yeah
if you were to meet me two years ago and
feel my brows they literally would have
been down here interesting it's scary
it's what it was and I feel like oh all
the photos are so public there yeah
they're all there they're all documented
and like literally I don't get the most
hate comments ever and I think oh my god
people are so mean I love my brows and
then looking back at it out you're like
why did I love that I was like thank you
all for leaving me those death threats
up my eyebrows because it worked my
eyebrows so now I learned I did it's
another a little bit more arts but I
still don't have that big of a brow bone
yeah it's so interesting again like face
structures cuz I just don't think about
it yeah you know I don't think about
faces looking different yeah what do you
really like about doing different makeup
looks
I mean it's art you know it's art that I
can experience because I'm feeling it
yeah first is so much art in the world
I can't experience I can't see I can't
enjoy so for me that's what I love yeah
you need to explain to them exactly what
you're explaining to me about eyeshadow
right well you forgot this so when I get
a new palette I memorize where the
shadows are so you can probably tell
which ones I love I love this shadow
right here which is like a matte kind of
warm tone brown I love this color which
is a matte peachy kind of shade
I love this color which is like a really
shimmery coppery almost I think I love
these two shades right here I do that
show you a lot which i think is like a
peach shade not as shimmery as this one
yeah but in a kind of deeper peach color
I love these too for like a really fun
beachy look huh which are kind of more
bright like corals yeah and then of
course like this is a great highlight or
I'll do this on the lid which is like a
light gold yes and then I'll usually do
that like as a highlight if I want to
brow bone highlight that is the craziest
thing of the most amazing yeah it's all
count memorized why do I do your makeup
like I think I want to try to go through
and a shadow palette and see if I have
any other memorize I think I might be
able to do it probably oh my god that is
so cool to me
when you can't see you just figure it
out yeah all the time I'll come grab my
videos annoying I don't know how she
does a like I could never be blind if I
went blind I would kill myself I'm like
okay sure there's the times when I felt
like that when I first went blind and
was being bullied and dealing with
depression eyes purple on it oh well I
clean your brushes I'm sorry what life
hands you a situation that you
expect you just figure it out yeah you
know just do I'm gonna actually go back
to the concealer and just use this as
primer perfect hi we're on a budget
always who needs 50 million products you
can multi use mom what would you say
would be like your all-time favorite
makeup brand I left heart mm-hmm I love
Too Faced mm-hmm I love Mac since it's
what like brought me into the makeup
world when I was 12 13 and told my mom
that I really wanted to start wearing
makeup she felt like it would probably
end up in a disaster if she just like
bought me a bunch of drugstore makeup
and like handed it to me and was like no
and so she took me to a Mac counter yeah
um and had them got all the shades for
me and she had them teach me like which
produções wear and she bought it all for
me and then I figured it out and I would
practice and I loved it and then every
birthday and every Christmas she would
bring me to get a new look as I got
older and that's how I started
collecting so for about five years of
makeup loving Mac was like the only
brand that existed to me and I was like
Sephora what yeah well Mac was the only
bear that kind of existed for most
beginner makeup offers a long time yeah
I took me a long time you know once I
was like deep into the Beauty YouTube
world and I was like okay I need to
start trying some of these I think like
probably the first product I bought
outside of Mac was like Make Up For Ever
HD which then ended up becoming like my
Holy Grail foundation that was my holy
crap foundation when I first started it
like still is I love that oh my god I
love that
I just love the texture like it really
sinks seamlessly into your skin you know
I agree so the beauty guru world kind of
really got you into makeup that
absolutely like I loved makeup before
yeah but that's what just got like the
obsession went so deep which I'm sure so
many people watching this could relate
to
yeah that's literally how I started
screws the budget yeah I started
watching like Jacqueline Hale
nikkietutorials were like the two people
that really got me into it who do you
like like watching back in 209 I loved
shoe seastar o7 Blair Fowler yes I loved
Megan Hart's makeup uh-huh Megan Parkin
I loved bethany mota of Cour course
Queen um those were like my three girls
they were like my sisters literally like
they were like who were some of your
face in the beauty's face I really like
Jeffery I really like
I really like Carli bybel and it's crazy
because it is our very very clever
community right now and they always love
people but not many people stick out
when I think all right who's content
really inspires me yeah that's why I
feel like I go outside of the beauty
community for like people inspire me can
you like just like neutral neutral lipid
yeah you're pretty full lips lucky
thanks Juvederm okay rub your lips
together now you have to try to do your
own mascara Umi car man so you can do
this easily
Oh Cole Oxley oh I always try to go like
into the little baby lashes in my inner
corner and that's when I hit my nose I
think I still do have a slight advantage
because I can see the wand right not
like very well but it's like it's blurry
I'm legally blind clearly I can still
see you but like I think by optometrist
standard so you can't drive a car though
cuz no one okay so when you don't have
your glasses or contacts in here oh no I
would crash in three seconds yeah yeah
my vision has always been bad but it
just keeps getting worse and worse
just like blindness like blindness is a
spectrum we all have like different
different amount of vision left maybe
one day we'll be able to do a full blind
collapse again you'll be my fellow blind
person on YouTube wanna watch this I
always found easier the inner corner
lashes
I feel like you're definitely not gonna
be as full glam as you're used to do you
do many videos without makeup on I don't
wear makeup as like a confidence booster
yeah yeah I wear makeup like to express
myself into yeah I can't see I litter I
see the difference makeup makes okay I
don't look in the mirror be like oh I
look good tonight feel good I would say
I'm equally as confident I love myself
just as much yeah nervous the judgment
the judgment other god no it's gonna be
literally good regardless okay Molly
looks really good yeah yeah definitely
way less than it was usually when I feel
like it looks like this is your everyday
look no yeah I love that people throw
makeup pretty quickly like most girls
like like have an average beauty routine
of like 10 to 30 most girls don't do a
beauty guru beauty routine no you know
mostly most girls don't
full glam daily and you know I've always
wanted to kind of see what I look like
with like a normal persons yeah I
usually spend one to two hours on it and
even when I try to do light makeup I
still end up with heavy makes so much--
take a lot and the despite the fact that
you cannot see what's going on right now
this looks really good and I love this I
did classic Mali makeup on you and now
blindfolded you have to do classic James
Charles that's great to do that I'm
pretty confident my abilities that I
also think I have the upper hand because
I can see what you look like beforehand
