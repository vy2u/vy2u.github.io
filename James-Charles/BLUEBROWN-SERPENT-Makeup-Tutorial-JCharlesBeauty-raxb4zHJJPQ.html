James for those of you who don't know me
I'm a 16 year old makeup artist from New
York and I run the Instagram page Jay
Charles Beauty lately literally 150
percent of my comments have been so here
I am on YouTube in front of my camera
with my light with a whole lot of makeup
in front of me making a tutorial and I
can't believe I'm doing this but it's
about damn time today I did this blue
brown and green trio chrome look I'm
going to call it serpent and if you guys
want to see how to recreate this makeup
look make sure to keep on watching also
if you like this tutorial don't forget
to hit that thumbs up button down below
and subscribe if you haven't already for
more tutorials coming soon hi guys I'm
going to be starting off today using my
benefit Porefessional primer I have a
million little bumps and pores all over
my face so doing this really helped me
smooth everything out and get an even
foundation application next I'm going
into my la girl pro color corrector
concealer in orange just to color
correct my 5 o'clock shadow and my under
eye circles if you don't have this
problem obviously don't color crunked
because this is not pumpkin glam but if
you're like me and you get negative 15
hours of sleep this might be for you I
also color corrected my acne spots using
a green color corrector also from la
girl and then blended it out with my
Beauty Blender now I'm going in with my
Make Up For Ever HD ultra foundation in
the shade Y 255 and just putting a bunch
of little dots all over my face
obviously we're going to blend these out
later on but it just helps create a
really even application when you're
blending don't forget to blend on your
neck and on your ears too we want a
smooth transition and the last thing we
need is Moses parting the foundation C
on your face to highlight my face I'm
using my la girl Pro concealer in the
shade porcelain I'm drawing little
triangles on my face in the middle of my
forehead into the middle of my chin on
my mustache area and just one line down
the center of my nose this will just
make all the high points of my face
stand out and then once again at
blending out with my Beauty Blender now
I'm setting my entire face using Coady
respon powder because i am done with the
liquids and creams this will help to set
everything in place and to reduce crease
edge
to further highlight my face I'm going
to use my morphe 48 brush and this light
color for my Luna detect cosmetics
contour lab this color usually comes in
the contour palette but I actually de
potted it and just put it in my Z
palette with all my other contour and
highlight shades once again I'm just
putting this on all the high points of
my face to contour today I'm using my
morphe m-52 3 brush and my makeup geek
contour pans these colors are literally
so good and they're so pigmented I'm
using the shade warm fair today just to
create a nice basic contour and I'm
going on my cheekbones my five head and
on my jawline to really carve everything
out and make my face look super defined
next to further define my contour I'm
using the same brushes before and make a
peak Coco bear it is an eye shadow but I
never use blush in my look so this
really helps to just warm everything up
next I'm just making my face using my
once again Cody airspun powder and my
powder puff I'm just drawing two really
harsh defined lines from the tops of my
ears to right above the corner of my
mouth this will help really carve out
that contour and with whatever's left on
the powder puff I'm just going to put
underneath my eyes and in the center of
my forehead because I literally use so
much facial expression when I talk my
face creases so badly so doing this
helps decrease the creasing if that
makes any sense now to start the eyes I
did my brows off-camera just because I
tried and the angles turned out so bad I
promise I will do a proud to toriel
later on but for now we're just going to
stick with this so to start off I'm
using makeup geek Peach Smoothie and my
morphe and four-for-one brush just to
get a nice transition shade going in my
crease for this entire look I use my
morphe 35 K palette
since the shades don't have actual names
I'll just be like describing them really
all you need to know is that I used a
light and medium and a dark brown to
create the halo eye effect and then
obviously I'm going to be going into
blues and greens later on
to further define that halo i i'm using
my morphe m4 for one and once again just
a medium brown tone from the 35k palette
i'm putting that in the inner and outer
V's of the eyes and then just taking
whatever excess product is left and
going in windshield wipers just to
define that crease now I'm using my
morphe M 509 and a darker Brown from the
35 K just to further define the inner
and outer V's and once again the crease
same thing just really keep darkening
that halo eye and making sure there's a
nice even transition once I have nothing
on that brush I'm just going in my lower
and upper lash line just make sure
everything is super blended out now for
the pop of color I'm spritzing my flat
definer brush with mac's fix+ and then
going into the makeup geek Houdini I'm
just packing this all over the center of
my lid and making sure to blend it up to
my crease but not playing it up too far
because we don't want it to get muddy
and gross looking next I'm going into
the typhoon it's a makeup geek dual
chrome eyeshadow it's just green and
blue and I'm focusing that right on the
center of the lid and that's just with
the tiny morphe definer brush I'm just
going back in with my M 509 and a dark
brown from the 35 K just to make sure
that all the edges are super blown out
and there's no harsh lines in the
waterline I'm just going in with the
Italian deluxe eye pencil in turquoise I
got this at the morphe store if you
don't have this eye pencil you can
easily just do black it's really up to
you but I wanted another pop of color on
the bottom I actually lost the clip but
I did use the NYX jumbo eye pencil in
black bean just to mimic the halo effect
that we have going on on the upper lid
and then once I did that I'm just going
back under the lower lash line to blend
everything out and connect it back up to
the top I'm just going to now with my
favorite mascara benefit roller lash
it's so good it makes my lashes look so
long and not clumpy so I would
definitely recommend I applied my
falsies off camera today I use the black
magic lashes in siren I ended up glued
my eye shot what I try to do on camera
so definitely not going to do that again
anyway a lesson learned this is the
finished eye look sorry for the wonky
lash but I'm going to go ahead and do
the other one off camera and then we can
go ahead and finish the face together
- hi Lee I'm just stretching my brush
again with mac's fix+ to make it super
defined and then mixing these two colors
for my Anastacio glow kit now we pack
that highlight on like there's no
tomorrow remember the goal is that
you're highly can be seen from space
and that you blind everybody walking by
I always highlight my cheekbones the tip
of my nose and my Cupid's bow just
because I think it looks cute for my
lips today I'm using Oprah Brooklyn you
guys always ask what liquid lipsticks I
like best and they're definitely Oprah
the formulation is so good and they
don't dry crusty and gross like so many
other brands do as an optional last step
I went ahead and I added Houdini all
over my lips just for a cool duo chrome
effect and that guys is the finished
look I really hope you enjoyed this
tutorial and I will see you soon with a
new video bye
