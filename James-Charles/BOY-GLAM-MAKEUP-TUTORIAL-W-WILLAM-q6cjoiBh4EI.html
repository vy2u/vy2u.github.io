the second break from dry for a few days
Jax are gonna break for me and you wanna
see how we created this level make sure
you keep on watching
let's oh I am so many brushes you need
Obama cousin to produce very good place
so for foundation today I'm using my
makeup Ultra HD foundation set its way
dark because this clouds not planned and
it not just me and not little but sorry
so you give foundation first yeah okay I
don't understand that
it's reason personally go around back I
do do you really yeah way too much work
cuz I actually feel like minesweeper
brought like your eyes many don't yeah
you just overlap and then glitter yes
that doesn't work for me more the other
thing you can do is you do your
foundation first and then you put your
eyes on is not give a fuck yeah that
works that works as well so for
concealers today we're going to be using
our two phase 4 unless we concealer in
the shade very hair to hopefully like
enough the foundation a little bit and
make it match no you just touched that
area with something so what are we doing
now no you use a lot of product he's -
so far there would be this big
like I'm right there my head's way
larger than yours how much powder well
either coating at some powder or this up
is so much oh this stuff someone I know
because if
okay for you going to use a wet sponge
in powder to be honest with you I just
think it because I feel trendy doing so
that's important yeah it's very
important which that is half of a false
lash that is the one when you when you
find a lash and your fucking views when
you lean against the counter whatever
happened to you know yes a huh
so now we're baking just not seven whose
the growing brain yeah in began all

didn't think we would be laughing you
didn't think I was going to come through
I have all my stuffing can use it on you
but if when I make sure it doesn't
bother you about the clean brushes and
sharing makeup I said I eat at jaws
it's pretty very nondescript well see
the things in mind the foundation twice
wears off on the side right here little
whenever I contour it'll look good for
like here down right here at the powders
we're right into the sea of foundation
that's everywhere else since well not
zero eyelid space we're going to make do
