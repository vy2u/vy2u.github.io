Halloween I don't care anybody says
hallow Tober I hated that so few weeks
ago it's a Fiat Nygaard filmed a video
where she had her boyfriend Tyler go to
the store and buy her a bunch of
different outfits that she thought would
look good on that so for today's video
me and Ricky are copying her because
we're unoriginal and we would be make me
stores in a twist
we gave it a twist we take so we won't
go to the Halloween time picked out
three different costumes so we don't
have boyfriends so we're being so that
your boyfriend's today yeah for each
other yeah so tinder is not going too
well in Vicky's asexuals exactly
basically we picked out three costumes
for the other person and at the end
we're gonna choose which costume we
liked the best and then put a makeup
look on the person to master the costume
so we had to like go above and beyond
here so Ricky's ibaka showed me his
Constance that he picked up for me he
has been so serious all day long about
me not seeing them like literally oh I'm
all about like a natural reaction
surprised I don't wanna peek so he
didn't he didn't see him okay without
further ado let's go ahead and get
started let's pick it up in spooky okay
