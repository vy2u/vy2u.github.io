talking about childhood memories
we actually had probably the worst hell
had ever together yeah we hate each
other yeah like pretty bad now we're
closer kind of if you guys did not know
I have 18 and Ian is 16 so that is a two
year age difference and now it means
nothing but when we were younger
Oh two years goes a long way and
obviously I am loud and obnoxious in
that race get my way and Ian was always
quiet defi was like the good younger
brother like would always just beat down
for anything would always be like nice
kind could not relate I was honestly
nothing like a really huge bully
well we fought a lot and it was up
always my fault but it was usually my
apology would painfully hurt me well yes
but I remember there was one time we
were fighting about something at dinner
he was still staying in a high chair
everybody got so huge where I got up out
of my regular dining chair and I kicked
the leg of his high chair over and his
high chair fell back and we had a
radiator right behind our dinner table
and he caught his entire lip open and
sort of bleeding and had him to the
hospital
remember this Pope really but I hate you
no that was not a fun one deadly was
grounded from Lincoln my Tamagotchi and
like the we for a hot minute well you
have like anger management help so you
were younger like this is making me out
to sound like I was some psychotic
monster but you you we're like psychotic
when you were younger like boys were
fighting keep chasing inside one time in
our old house and I remember I slammed
the front door so he couldn't get to me
and I stand his entire hand in the door
and he broke his fingers me heading to
the hospital yeah that was I remember
that that was yeah but you had a coming
probably I'd have to slam a
thousand-pound steel door on me steel
door where are we living a jail I think
I knew James gay before a lot of people
did I remember when he was probably 10
or 11 he would always take dolls and
braid their hair that was not 11 and 10
that was like 4 5 6 years old 9 4 5 6
I also remember when he was little he
would dress me up with my mom's like
clothes and like boots and you played
along with it are you gay no but I was
like 4 years old what do you want me to
do well apparently you had a lot of
fighting going on until you go to follow
me on a guy to really enjoy it at the
time no I've always been a glam sister
what can I say that's easily how our
entire childhood would be Ian outside of
this friends like playing football and
me inside on the computer on like
webkinz and poptropica those guys were
land memories to go to Florida every
April breaking go to Mimi's house and
stay with our cousins yawn zapper hell's
middle of Bop hey hey it was a fun time
number one we were in the canoe and
decided to tip us an alligator-infested
water that is not really that's like not
exactly what happened though it was a
wondrous in what happened no okay it was
me yo and our cousin Riley were canoeing
in the middle of like the jungle and our
cousin said like oh turn the or to the
right and clearly ever you know me I am
NOT a rower in any way shape or form I
should not be doing any physical
activity upper and I ended up moving us
to the left and we end up tipping the
canoe in the middle of the lake which
had alligators I have never swam faster
in my entire life
like Michael Phelps was quaking at that
given moment whatever he was like
literally
I think he could feel his olymic record
like about to be BM by sister James
swimming remembered me and Robbie had to
go back in there and get it after it's
sunk as you stood on the shore oh you
know I remember the biggest my most
worst nightmare was a kid I thought Big
Bird was like walking down the road
about a cupcake oh my god remember when
you had that dream all the time when
you're younger yeah this is like Big
Bird like walking down the road like
coming into our house and like
kidnapping me and I don't know why I had
it but I remember that dream so clearly
that is so strange first of all why do I
don't know oh my god oh my god I can't
believe you just this is like all coming
back to me right now I had one
reoccurring dream where I was on a
Barbie cruise ship maybe it's all the
fucking Barbie heads that I play with
and do their hair of every single day
hello gay from day one and then they
would drive into like the city of
Manhattan and it would like plow through
the city and then I would get thrown
overboard from like a hundred two
hundred feet up in the air and die every
time that I had the dream it was so
weird and happened to be so many times
think I was about five or six I don't
know what happened but my mom heard a
thud and she came into the room and she
saw that I was lying on the floor so she
looked at me didn't see anything goes
wrong put me back into bed then I walked
down the next morning and apparently I
had dried blood all over my face and a
huge gash underneath my cheek which I
still have a scar from said she couldn't
see you guys in her glasses on speaking
of falling oh my god you just triggered
them I remember I could get sick pretty
often for some reason my dad does too
were like dying at least once a month
when I was sick one time when I was
younger I remember I was like bedridden

like it was spooky boo goo boo I
literally thought I was gonna die God
about to go get an Advil in the bathroom
which is across the hall on the upstairs
level and we have a staircase in the
middle of the hallway and I remember I
really don't remember actually but I
woke up at the bottom of the stairs with
my dad screaming like falling down the
stairs as well because I had walked by
the stairs and passed out right at the
top of the staircase

stairs completely unconscious did not
even feel a single thing and my dad was
like screaming freaking out we went to
the hospital once again thank God I did
