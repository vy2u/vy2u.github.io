cool but I fellers I'm James and nom
Mian and welcome to brother and sister
sister brother brother and sister
brother and sister on today's episode
we're gonna be talking about leaving
home yeah why do you always do that a
few months ago marked my official a
one-month anniversary of living in Los
Angeles for one year I've I've been
living alone and it has literally
changed my life so so so much and has
been nothing like I ever expected it to
be what do you expect to be I don't
really know I was just like ready to
like live in my mansion and like have my
personal chefs but like do not a lot of
work and like have my g-wagen but then
Mercedes is gonna be the g-wagen and I
am renting a mic oh yeah I don't have a
personal shop and I posted everything
and have to Eber everywhere it's just a
lot but I love that I'm still in high
school I'm only a sophomore so I have
two years left living home definitely
has its benefits it good to see all my
friends and live around my family but I
feel like I want to move to LA soon see
you say that now but then once you get
to LA you realize how alone you actually
are and how nobody here cares on you at
all in this bed which is just a lovely
thought process that really you know
just makes me so happy at a daily basis
but like I and I know you are too was
heavily reliant on mom and dad to help
us with no yes I do not want my mom at
all yeah you couldn't die in one thing
my mom does your laundry she cooks you
food actually obviously cannot cook
herself and I think probably burn down
our house is a fake but okay other than
that your you'd be starving to death
literally
wives you places because you cannot draw
that's not my problem
yeah well I'm saying if you were gonna
move here you'd have to figure it out
gal cuz it's not like you can walk
everywhere good luck with that
uber right dad does all your homework
for you because you're a little read um
dad is not told I'm are schooled all my
homework I would love to javi drove to
LA just
be here like 10 minutes and figure
yourself out I've been here for a week
I'm pretty sure I work so brave sweetie
so proud II thank you when I moved to LA
a reality set in and oh I had no idea
what I was missing out on holy crap
although mom's a face by Presta piece
every night that sucked sucked I had not
had a home-cooked meal in like months I
just posted everything which is good and
fresh but at the same time like hello
like I do miss mom's gross meatloaf
occasionally and like nice spaghetti
sometimes also I don't have a car
because if I was to drive 10 minutes in
LA I would definitely crash and probably
die because I'm literally the worst ever
ever sent it over everywhere which is
once again fine but you know sometimes
you just want to like be on your own
time and not have to worry about
somebody's horrible taste in music in
the front seat it was you and opening up
the window ever in LA is literally the
worst and they're all really really fake
unless you find good people so have fun
with that spooks my gooped everything
here is ridiculously expensive so you'll
be paying thousands and thousands and
thousands of dollars every month just to
breathe the air here which is gross and
polluted and general anyway so it's not
even like you're breathing good air
there only sounds wonderful I don't have
a laundry unit in my apartment and the
weird creepy room in the basement of my
building is so gross so spooked I never
once went down there without feeling or
ridiculously uncomfortable and being
watched the entire time so now I have to
pay people to come do my laundry which
is literally the dumbest first role
problem ever and the entire world and I
never have clean clothes they were the
same outfit every single day and that's
why I have you follow me on snapchat you
know that I always wear the same stuff
because I'm too scared to do my own
laundry living the town that I do it's
not really a big town so I don't really
ever feel unsafe but like living in LA
you can definitely feel some sketchy yes
oak smoke situations at all times of the
day I live downtown which I constantly
I'm talking about in complaining about
on snapchat and on Twitter because
that's literally like discourteous place
on earth hello I feel like I'm going to
die at like every moment that I walk
outside every time I go with makeup on
I'm verbally attacked by at least 10
different spooky men walking by on the
street and always
Oh sweetie you look beautiful love her
appreciate her at all cost because she's
the saving grace that gives you the
faith to even step out of my apartment
on a daily basis but I agree I never
actually felt unsafe growing up where we
did and like we would never even like
lock our door or anything and like now
oh my god one of my biggest fears is
home intruders I don't know why it just
spooks me it's so so so so so much and I
used to always have nightmares about
people coming into her house and telling
me hey and I used to like I always used
to think about like if there was a home
intruder that was gonna come in right
now and try to kill me
how could I flip the table and try to
somehow get them instead of me and
survive the situation like Katniss
Everdeen that type of living in LA
no I do always feel unsafe and the first
thing I do every time I get home is walk
both of my freakin lashes on my door cuz
I'm not trying to get killed by a
baseball bat with nails in it I would
probably miss knowing she definitely
should get like a weapon of some sort I
don't believe in weaponry what you gonna
do punch him in the face when they come
in let's lock the door how you gonna get
in I live on on the penthouse floor of
my building you talk oh it's good by the
way but you don't understand what home
is like I like about 7:00 o'clock every
day to go to school get home F to do
homework most likely take a nap because
I'm tired so go to bed and do the same
thing five days a week I did that first
17 years you're not special sweetie
IRA said I was both that's why I'm
trying to move to LA well yeah I mean I
definitely understand where you're
coming from and that like sometimes
working on the schedule Sox but on the
other hand living in LA and being
self-employed I do get to kind of work
on my own schedule which is pretty good
and frosh
you got a point there pretty good and
fresh
when I was younger the main reason I
wanted to move out and get my own place
so badly was to decorate it and to have
a cute apartment that's that's a fact
yeah I love decorating
I love interior design hello like my
life is a Pinterest boards and printers
for with my entire savings actually like
it is also nearly organized into
everything house kitchen living room
walk-in closet like oh I cannot wait to
buy a house and make it literally the
cutest ever it'll be like a magazine
you're walking into it and I cannot wait
my dreams were crushed though when I
moved into my apartment and it was first
of all not that they second of all
couldn't paint it because hello I'm
renting it really rude I have fought
with my landlord for weeks on end to try
to paint my brick in my apartment white
and they wouldn't let me do it so rude
I'm so disrespectful can't even believe
I can't believe that but it was sad can
you imagine how cute my burger would've
been with white brick hello it's so good
imagine Oh cute probably without trash
well that's what I was getting at hold
on hey I was getting there
now that I have funds over all the time
I'm always working I'm always doing
shoots employees opening PR boxes and
boys ordering postmates five times a day
I get trash so quickly and for some
reason I don't know why I just produce
so much trash and boxes and gross things
on my apartment that just end up there
and I have to like clean up at least
twice a week and like do like an entire
life cleanse and it's really
overwhelming that's because you don't
have mom to clean but there was a good
side to that because she might find some
stuff you don't want her to find nothing
to hide okay go through anything you
want my house you will not find anything
okay
I mentioned moving to LA to mom and dad
but mom says she's not letting me do
that unless she comes with us mom is not
ever moving anywhere close to me ever no
I can't do it her because I know she'll
walk into the house completely uninvited
without even knocking on the door
regular well anything so sneak in
through a window no they are freaking
mom I don't like wake me up in the
morning and be like rise and shine
and give God the glory oh yeah you can
never stand me to savor though but that
is like a little bit our bomb down to a
definition she is not what makes her
think she's moving to LA I don't know
even though I do really love mom and
really do miss a lot of the help she
gave me
TASIS living alone has honestly been a
really really cool experience that I
think forced me to grow up so fast
but I really wouldn't change it for the
world like I've been forced to become
such a independent person and to really
work on a schedule and to get up early
everyday without somebody coming in and
sticking and clapping at me and
literally pulling me out of bed because
that happened many a time when I was
gonna be late for school
and it just taught me a lot I think I
still have a lot to learn with conquer
my fears of the laundry room downstairs
and like making my own food without
burning my entire apartment building
down but little things will come with
time it's okay I'm still young still
learning still growing all that matters
that I'm paying my rent and having a
good time I guess I definitely agree
with you I kind of do enjoy living at
home I get to play for night and my
friends see some of the kids I like in
school I'll spend my yeah spend my money
on supreme rather than rent so yeah it
would be really good it's a good time
