with me done I hope that's what I just
asked you I'm Tommy and welcome back to
brothers and sister brother and sister
how do you see focus on today's episode
we're gonna be going up back in time to
discuss something that I am horrified
you can think about no squall we're not
really going that far back in time I'm
still in school and you graduated like
last year so yeah but it feels like it
was a long time ago school for me was a
spooked situation I definitely knew it
that I wanted to catch it early and get
out and I was really not feeling life
anymore
really pop I definitely agree I'm only a
sophomore and I'm trying to leave as
early as I can so I love that you should
definitely have like a high school
education but you don't really need
anything after that after I graduated I
have not used a single one of my classes
ever except for maybe mouth
I actually liked math a lot yeah I'm
like failing math so I love that for you
I think the worst part about me first of
all is that I am someone who very much
likes to live on the edge crazy and be
wild and for me having to wake up every
single morning at the same exact time
with our mom coming into my bedroom
singing songs and screaming at us to get
out of bed racing down the freeway
ticket to school that was scary
everybody would sprint into school well
then yeah you were late and then you
complained about it I was never late you
weren't athletic sister in the morning I
was not oh thank him homeroom I had the
worst homeroom teacher ever our homeroom
teacher would not let us be on our
phones or eat during homeroom I gotta
fight with her so many times about
evening Joseph put your coffee on the
back table I'm gonna sign to the
principal's office
it's like he's durable I would love to
go I was gonna open a college one day I
don't know why I would ever own a
college hello I would put like a
Chipotle in there I'll Wendy's over here
like I'm McDonald's in the English home
Oh
speaking of college do you think you
want to go to college
absolutely not it's like it's very
pointless I don't really like a major
Estonian anything in college so not sure
why I would go for four years hey
everyone I'm Professor Ian I'll be your
sub for today do whatever you want
are we playing full right in the corner
long sided makeup I also really love
interior design and I think I knew that
College was not for me when I went to
visit a fighty in New York and we looked
at the door rooms and they were
literally 3 feet by 3 foot rooms and I
asked about decorating the rooms because
the hello if you're at a design school
you'd think you'd be able to like make
your dorm room cue the person doing the
tour was like oh yeah we're not allowed
to paint or decorate the room I was like
hello you already live in this ugly at
crusty dusted busted rusted busted what
in box for four years I'm just like oh
no you just have to live here for two
years then you can get an apartment I
was like oh yeah with my $4,000 a month
apartment in the middle of Manhattan on
top of my a million dollar a month
student loans what I'm learning
absolutely nothing oh again I hate high
school really you do so much oh I
straight walk around with headphones in
my hood up every day oh you're one of
those people yeah kids at my school were
very annoying t can feel that everyone
is fake - Oh get him expose him dragon
car when you started gaining followers
like some of your friends like expect
more from you yeah let me was the worst
is that happening to you now that you're
like so much it's a famous yeah stole
the tasteless truck ever wants me to buy
them stuff ah be yeah I could as soon as
they started gaining followers and I
said was covered everyone thought I was
their sugar daddy all of a sudden I'm
like hello I'm looking for our serger
daddy I'm not trying to be your guys's
serger daddy in the middle of Bethlehem
New York who was asking to buy you
things and what do they ask me to buy
I'm gonna name any names oh so sorry I
don't know you're a loyal to these
people sweatshirts shoes
shirts basically everything sick
clothing what a weird request I think I
could afford I story time my high school
bully like hello made my high school
life a living hell
hey there every day of my life you know
exactly what I'm talking about literally
sent me a ticket II pick a tease because
he was convinced we got diggity Pig I
did let me finish he was convinced that
I was gonna buy him Gucci shoes hazing
oh yeah like I really want these Gucci
shoes like I'll do anything for them and
I was like oh really like what do you
have to offer he's like I'll send you
anything mind you this guy was really
hot well I thought he was hot at the
time now he's hideous literally so ugly
but I think it also is the fact that his
personality is totally one of the worst
in the entire world I think that I've
ever met but anyway regardless of a
personal luck because what's on the
outside is not important
apparently what's in his pants as though
it was it was really good and he was
like are you gonna buy me the shoes and
I was like no absolutely not and he's
like aw that was really crappy of you
and I was like wow so was you bullying
me for the past 10 years of my life he
fakes things I think at least once a
week with some other random college girl
that he's like trying to get in the
pants off I mean like oh my god hey
James and then he'll like pan the camera
and there she is I just hang out every
single time you remember last year when
I was biking home and then week on that
like argued with that kid
and then the next day in school I got
punched in the face yes I remembered
that video that was all over Twitter I
was a weak bones what basically the kid
bought we said something to him probably
probably probably did say something to
him he then started DM me on Instagram
sayings that have come to my house and
he came to my house at like 12 o'clock
in the morning we love a man who follows
her with his words rang on the doorbell
and asked my dad to fight me dad then
grabbed a baseball bat and chase him
down the driver thought us like our dad
like - Helen - uh t only walks the next
day at school it was an English class
like eighth period yes he so I came in
started screaming shit at me
call me they decided to punch her in the
face and then continue to scream and
then ran out the door down the hallway
ending us suspended it's pretty dumb
that's the thing that happened to me
when I was in high school we've talked
about this before but I also got
punished we have from skateboard kid
dude right yeah Jamie you can't say
names he's gonna I said my other video
already I dare him to come $100 I'll be
rolling good in frost ah my puncher does
I make up okay so although high school
may have been not the best for both of
us what was one experience that you did
like with high school in school and like
nothing well I'll go because I for one
do think education is sort of important
here in the current world we're living
as weak okay you are about you have
about like four brains slashing
education here sweetheart
I for one like the fact that it kept me
under schedule because I am probably the
laziest well not lazy I'm a really bad
procrastinator and Visayas do for me for
spirit you better bet I wasn't finishing
it on the way there like with my binder
in my hand scribbling down the answers
from some other bitch that was 30 nights
being over I literally passed high
school because of her which was so wet
straight A's love that for me Queen is
coming but you're obviously very
antisocial in Seoul which is weird I was
like literally friends with everybody -
anti-social Thomas antisocial - like a
lot of people but I'm like really social
like my good friends I had a new friend
over every day when I was in high school
probably no I have like well I've lost
friends since high school started
oh I'm not only fun when I was younger
why go let's be friends everybody like I
once everybody found me annoying
until I hang out why would you see that
what is even like going on in school
right now like they'll be out on the
golf set well one of the biggest
problems for our principal is probably
um kids vaping in the bathroom oh I mean
good though you guys do not need to be
smoking in the Sun I'm doing that but we
caused um literally 150 kids like and
he's calling
well good for him is so thrashing like
you do not need to be doing that ever
like you just like walk in there's like
15 kids it's like sitting to vape in the
corner
that's gross you guys are like 12 years
old speaking of vaping and smoking and
drinking and partying is the quickstone
thing 100% there's one tonight actually
oh thank god you're not going I can't
believe this is still a thing holy
Greene um I know I never once why if
you're you're probably very confused if
you're watching this right now when I
was in school there was a spot right in
your house in the woods that kids would
go and party there's a huge bonfire and
they get so black out drunk every single
Friday afternoon I would go on Twitter
and like would be like posting a makeup
look and I would see everybody from my
school posting Clinton tonight it's not
like that anymore though it's silly a
gate gets busted a lot more good yeah
they posted all the time by the police
they start to catch on and oh there's a
new place now oh no where is that mom
and dad knows about the car they've
hunted us I know about the club they're
not stupid you can probably tell schools
not for either of us I guess social
media is the way to go all right stay in
school kids please education it's not
for everybody
but it is important so please pay
attention in your classes work hard and
then you can have fun later on because
if you high school is important college
is not but that's a whole separate story
