back to the sister and brother Chou
Cooper sister brother hi I'm James and
ami and welcome back to sister brother
mother and sister sister and brother her
mother and sister anyways brother and
sister cities episode we're going to
talk about people on social media for
our fans and our trolls
a creepy time having 4 million followers
alone is definitely an interesting
situation that not a lot of people can
relate to obviously I undone of those
people online that you either love or
you absolutely hate and want dead at all
cost that's me
no that's me know what I want you dead
that's horrible you love me I feel like
on social media right now we're out of
time where people are just being nasty
I'm like love being nasty at all times
and sometimes the hate really does speak
louder than the love when some his
followers are kind of creepy to leave
some creepy comments and DMS don't beat
me at this acerous not being me but they
say punch me in the face and all this
stuff so I say that well they're coming
on my post though well cut they learn
from the best
well that's weird good job guys you're
like punch me in the face daddy I'll cut
up your head give me like your top 5
best comments punch me in the face you
know a ping-pong paddle one yeah so I'm
gonna face with a ping-pong paddle
multiple times laptop the picture with
the waterfall yeah someone said jump off
the waterfall for me or something like
that
hello cocktail that sounds like I left
those Instagram comments on somebody
else's page they really did learn for me
you're welcome for that they love
getting punched in the face yeah it's
fun those are good cop busy I can't
relate I don't get good comments very
often
because I'm the queen of having online
scandals you I've gotten really good at
this point I figure out what I can say
and what I can't say and how I need to
say that telling not get attacked for
weeks and weeks on end but sometimes
pretty often clearly at this point I
slip up and get into some sort of
scandal but it's usually just like wolf
Twitter and Stan Twitter being offended
over literally nothing and like pulling
a scandal out I feel like people on
Twitter like literally just wait for you
to say something just to get an argument
going like yeah can you imagine having
nothing to do with your life and doing
that all day yeah they sit on Twitter
for no reason it scares me I don't think
I left a hate comment once in my entire
life your vote I just wanted to know
like hello somebody's told the two of me
what do you get out of going to
somebody's page and just like writing
something nasty to them like it I it's
like does it make you feel better
knows you're like Jackie and your mom's
based at like sweetie if that makes you
happy like go for a girl like I'm so
glad that you're giving it to me as
opposed to somebody who can't take it
but like literally what's the point my
favorite people and I say that very
sarcastically on a woke Twitter are the
ones that literally get offended over
everything like the ones who are you
tweet like that was so funny oh my god I
can't even breathe and you get instant
reply within seconds you like wow my
grandpa actually died of the Cosmo last
year I can't even believe you would have
the nerve to say that that's all
what was that that was the funny moment
yeah it didn't you bud
wow it's such a beautiful day in LA
today I just need to go swimming oh my
god it actually almost drowned in a pool
three years ago when I was 11 years old
and I cannot believe you would even have
the nerve to bring up the idea that's
like a really tripping to me dude you're
a savage for tweeting that Savage right
oh my god you guys I just have my puppy
how to say he's such a good boy um that
dog actually can't express its true
gender identity so please don't give it
pronouns
I feel so how're ya I hate for night how
could you say that four nights the best
game ever created you just ruined that
completely sorry I'm the queen of
fortnight you were the youth play it
twice ah that's not true I've gotten a
victory round no you have not yes I
haven't even a Greyson's don't you tell
me I'm the queen of gaming I want to ask
right now don't go for it please do it
yes ever okay I will destroy you in four
night tilt the towers let's go
you destroyed one meteors coming in next
she is it's getting strudel thank you
for ruining my jokes I had all my
scandals very early on in my career and
I quickly learned that people when
they're mad are gonna come with full
force and they're gonna come in squads
but they usually act like sheep all in
one unknowing herd buying together to
leave hey comments but I cannot imagine
sitting online all day long with
literally nothing better to do than just
to tweet and to post and usually be mean
to people for no reason but at the same
time Stantler is lent
nothing makes me laugh harder than when
somebody like post the picture of a
stand and then all the comments below or
arguing like oh blank out so o blink
ended Oh blink screw never started that
gets me so good every single time but
like one of the things that really makes
me laugh is one so imposed a picture of
us on Instagram but it's like edited so
like but be like this they can have a
hue
a huge smile skinny like Mariah yeah
skinny like skinny wedges
there's one Instagram account that
always ties me in pictures it's
literally the same exact picture of me
like 300 times a day what's fun is that
it's like a picture of me with my face
like ended in I have a fan account I
have a James Charles luscious lips fan
account that is posts every single
selfie but just cropped right at the
leptin Oh No and they Rae my lips in
each photo I also have one that does
that tiny nose contour as well that's
one of those two my neck it's PO stretch
like like right here down I don't know
Charles luscious lips and James Charles
snatch nose I think they're about a game
pen case so don't tell all you guys
every guy that I've ever been on a date
with has been through Instagram because
they've all been straight guys that's
the key one of the weirdest AMS I ever
received was he and I nose may sound
weird a little but could I see a picture
of the bottom of your feet like in what
well does that satisfy you
Oh another DM I received was hey I'm not
sure if you remember me but I'm pregnant
with your child
I love ty I really do not remember you
and I don't remember ever talking to you
so I don't think I am you don't think
you're pregnant with her oh wow yeah
that to hate I'll leave my denim jacket
on your house I need it for tomorrow lol
how does the clever she like really
finessed she thought she was gonna get
the address like swoop on and that's
creepy
oh yeah but she tried a for effort
whoever you are inbound Apolo says
you're gay as clearly yes let me lick
your toes sister why does everyone have
a foot fetish I'm scared if I was gay
I'd smash
so something your doubt sounds like
you're gay
privately out there who's wondering what
would be a successful way to slap in
tier DM in dumb idea yeah without asking
for feet pictures well they made that
one work anyways but I said without what
don't feel like being employee and they
say they support me and stuff like
rather than calling me like oh my god
daddy you're so hot like marry me like
no I won't do that you tell them so
would you think you ever date a fan
probably not has anybody said into your
dreams that you actually talked to
through social media it has one girl
from Chicago dying piece I love that you
decide that yeah you know she is yeah I
do honestly yeah from different
countries like I get like 35 real woman
from like Iceland likes like ripped like
weightlifters like hello that's a
weirdest thing I get like old men all
than I old men too it's like hey Ann are
you gay I'm just like no and you're like
fifty years old I get all done all the
time that are like trying to definitely
on top of that I have a thing where I
can only I like oh I'm only into guys
that are like within one or two years
like max on my age Tommy okay I wasn't
asking you that's weird continue anyway
I always get older men like that are
interested and like love you all daddies
but definitely not for me but my sugar
daddy applications are definitely open
so if I ever come to LA you're with a 45
year old man I'm gonna be very
disappointed oh I would never do that
I need a sugar daddy that I can just
like send and make up selfies too and
just like get chance like I will
definitely oh poor some dick ET peccatis
definitely not I would never do that
I've never actually sent a dick any
Piketty okay
like I would I will send you make up
pictures I'll send you make up selfies
unlike the occasional like nice text I
don't want to go out to dinner maybe
dinner
I could maybe do dinner I don't I'm not
doing anything with you I'm not getting
a bad I'm not traveling with you I'm not
setting you tickety pick it easy I just
need a social media straight boy that'll
like Huck okay okay yeah oh you just
said I need a social media straight boy
well yeah but I say that isn't like most
of them usually are actually straight
okay even though there are a lot of
really really annoying
trolls and people on social media that
are constantly being offended and
annoyed by everything to make me want to
quit my job every single one of my life
I do try a really really hard to focus
on love and in the end there is so much
more positivity in the negativity so
thank you guys for always literally
being the best you guys do have a foot
fetish please stand on my DMS or don't
mention it my DMS thanks I appreciate
