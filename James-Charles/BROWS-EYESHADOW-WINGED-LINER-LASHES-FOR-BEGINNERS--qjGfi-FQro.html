okay sisters hello so like I said I'm
starting off my veins already done and I
just went ahead and I did one eyebrow
and I completely off camera now you're
probably looking at this and saying oh
my god sister we were normal people none
of us want to rock a sunset half cut
crease at an everyday basis and trust me
I know I do not blame you but I do have
a reason for why I did such an intense
look today that we're gonna be going
through for today's though do I have a
lot of different questions and a lot of
techniques that I want to go over so
doing a look complicated like this is
really gonna allow my gonna hit every
different step in order to help you guys
step up your makeup routine since we're
only gonna be focusing on this area's
today and I really want to give you guys
the best view possible I'm gonna go
ahead and zoom you right in up so you
can see a super close-up so my first
step of my eye makeup is always my
eyebrows some people like to do them
first I really don't understand how they
do that hurry personally I always like
to do them after I base and before the
eye shadow and then carve it out Suika
are really really nice and even base so
I'm just gonna show you guys how I like
to do a mine today here in the makeup
community there's a very famous saying
about brows and that is that brows frame
your face and this is probably one of
the most true things I have ever heard
in my entire life the most common
question I get when it comes to brows is
how do I find at the perfect shape if
you guys want to start date for a very
very long time you would know that my
brows have undergone quite the huge
transformation
and definitely for the better when I
first started off they were super super
thick and had literally no arch to them
and this brow shape after very very long
time and a lot of nasty comments I
finally realized was driving my entire
face down no matter how hard I some eyes
or smiled it still somehow looked like
my brows were frowning and I obviously
realized that this was not the looks
that I wanted to go for once I solved my
pride and finally admitted that my
blocked brows were absolutely awful i
tweeze a ton of my eyebrows off to make
them a lot more arched my eyebrow
transformation was still not exactly
complete though I wore those eyebrows
for a good hot minute you guys love them
I love them but more recently I actually
changed them a little bit more by
tweezing off almost my entire brow tail
my eyebrows used to grow to around down
here so more recently I've been lifting
my tail upwards which gives my face a
more lifted and snatched look and also
gives me a more room for eye shadow as
you can see over on this eye brow shape
is a very very personal thing and of
course I'm gonna give you guys a few
tips and tricks in a second but I would
say that the absolute best way to figure
out your best brows is by taking selfies
it was through that that I realized the
errors that I was doing with my brows I
was able to kind of fix them and perfect
them through experimenting I understand
that you guys don't have hours every
single day to experiment with makeup
though so I'm gonna show you one super
helpful rule / tip and trick that can
really help you shape your brows this
super simple Brown trick involves three
lines of reference and all you're going
to need is your favorite brow pencil
today I'm using the Anasazi eyebrow
pencil in the shade medium brown the
first rule of thumb is that the inside
of your brow should always align with
the outside of your nostril so if you
can see on this side right here it
starts right when I align it my brow
pencil if we move over to this eye we
can see that they align at once again
perfectly so I'm just going to draw one
little line to mark the center of my
brow the next rule of thumb is that when
looking forward at the beginning of your
brow arch should align perfectly with
the outside edge of your pupil and as
you can see they do moving over to the
other side you can see bingo right here
so I'm just going to make my mark and
finally for the tail of your brow if you
hold your brow pencil at the corner of
your nose and headed out the
of your eye your brows a touch just like
that so once again coming to the side if
I hold my pencil right like this I'm
good on my brow tail right there now
that we have all three of those points
mapped out let's go ahead and actually
start filling in the brow the most
common question I get when it comes to
drawing your brows is how do I make them
look defined but still a natural and
hair like my answer to that question is
always use a brow pencil
I love brow pencils because the tip is
fine so you can really sketch in a tiny
little hairs for a natural and realistic
effect and you can also change the
pressure for a darker look on the tail
and a lighter look in the inner corner
so you still get that beautiful ombre to
find look to start filling them in I
always like to start in the inner
corners I'm gonna hold my pencil
vertically to my face and I'm gonna use
a very very light pressure and just
lightly place my pencil and just kind of
flick it upwards to create
natural-looking hair strokes you
definitely gonna want to start off with
light pressure and then press harder as
you get through the brow if you start
off too dark in the inner corner you're
gonna end up with the block brow which
is obviously not the look that we're
going for
once I areas although then I like to
take my pencil and keeping our
guidelines in sight I just like to
underline the bottom of the brow and
just kind of map out where I'm going to
go once again using really really light
pressure and creating a hair like little
strokes so it looks natural right to the
dot that we've created for the tail and
then once I have the tail I'm just going
to start by filling in that outer
triangle and start to bring it back
upwards right back into the eyebrow when
purchasing a brow pencil if possible of
course you should always get one that
has a spoolie at the end I freaking love
these things that they are so helpful
while doing brows and throughout the
entire process I always like to go
through and kind of brush through the
hairs just make sure the product is
getting blended together so nothing
looks too intense and too harsh it also
moves the hair around so you can kind of
see areas that you missed I need to add
a more product too once I have the
bottom and the tail all sketched out and
don't worry if it's Bessie we're going
to clean it up later of course I like to
take my spoolie and brush the hairs
downwards and then I like to do the top
of the brow I always like to make sure
that I'm brushing the hair away so I can
really see the area that I need to fill
Anna because if I do it this way it's
really easy to
time's going above the brow and then
your brow just keep getting thicker and
thicker and thicker and thicker and that
is usually not the best look similar to
the froth I'm using medium pressure and
just sketching in light hair like
strokes just to structure out the top of
the brow just like this and once I get
to the outer corner I'm just going to
connect it right into the tail and make
sure I didn't miss any areas filling it
and once I'm happy with how the brow is
filled and I always like to take a brow
gel now this step is totally optional
I would definitely icon it for people
like me if you have a lot of brow hairs
and you want to make sure that they
laying in the right direction up but you
can totally skip this and save a lot of
money if you have not a lot of brow
hairs totally up to you but I'm going to
using the benefit 24-hour brow center I
really like this one because it is like
some mint for your brow hairs it really
locks it in place and all I'm gonna do
is just run through the brow hairs and
brush them right in the right direction
so they're laying inside of where I
filled in that brow as you can see by
doing that too and moving around the
brow hairs I'm definitely missing a
little bit of definition or right up in
here so I'm just gonna go back into the
pencil and add in a few more light
strokes just to fill it in now the last
of my brow routine which is always my
favorite part is cleaning them up to do
this I'm just gonna grab a lot top
concealer brush like this this is the
morphe Emma
4 3 2 and your favorite full coverage
concealer for me it is shaped tape and
I'm just gonna put a little bit of a
dollop of this on the back of my hand
get a little bit on with that brush and
then I'm just gonna go right in and
start cleaning up that brow very very
carefully I really love cleaning up the
brows because not only does it give them
a much cleaner appearance but if you
make any mistakes while filling it and
concealer is the perfect way to fix them
up and make sure they are super super
snatched once I'm satisfied with the
line I always like to take the excess of
that concealer on that same exact brush
and put the remainder of it right on my
eyelid and I'm gonna use this concealer
today as an eye elated primer which is a
really really great hot because they do
almost the same exact thing so it's a
great way to save a lot of money and
your makeup routine with the dense
parking brush like this this is the
morphe m33 fry this is my all-time
favorite for setting the eyelids in
place I'm gonna dip this into a little
bit of my setting powder pop off the
excess and I'm just going to make sure
that concealer is right in place because
we
not want our eyeshadow to crease
throughout the day there we go that is
our brows laid and in place and now we
finally get to move on to the fun part
the eyeshadow for today's I try to look
I did decide to go with a sunset half
cut crease which like I said it was a
little bit of a crazy look for most of
you guys out there but I have a lot of
different techniques and tips and tricks
that I want to talk about because a lot
of the questions I received it talked
about blending and using a lot of colors
makes it really easy for you guys to see
how the blending techniques work before
we hop into the shadows I want to
quickly talk about makeup brushes
because good working tools or an
absolute necessity to any successful
makeup look you guys know that I have an
avid makeup lover and when it comes to
brushes I will admit I'm a little bit of
a hoarder
I mean this is literally my container of
fluffy eyeshadow blending brushes alone
but I understand it that is really
unrealistic for you guys makeup can be a
ridiculously expensive so I compiled a
list of eight different brushes that I
think would be a necessity to any makeup
lovers collection and I think that could
achieve any sort of eyeshadow look
desired first we have the morphe m4 for
one this retails for $6.00 ition shades
next we have the morphe m-43 3 yet this
is the best crease brush in the entire
world and you need this in your
collection I could probably do an entire
eye shadow look with just one of these
brushes and I'm not kidding when I say I
have 27 of them in my collection you
obviously did not need 27 but if your
eyeshadow lover like me I would
recommend getting at least 3 of these
because you can really use them for any
single look this is the amma 506 and
retails once again for $6 and is a
fluffy pointed brush which I really
really love for detailed crease work or
blending out an outer V this is the a
matte 2 to 4 and it is a round flat
concealer brush and this is my all-time
favorite brush for either carving out
the brows or doing a cut creases this is
the amma 205 and it is also a round flat
concealer brush but it is much smaller
and instead of using this for concealer
i actually use this to pack shadow on
the lid finally this is the m14 9 it is
a tiny round and a bullet brush and I
use this for highlighting the inner
corners highlighting the brow bone and a
buffing shadow onto the lower lash line
you can get all eight of those brushes
for only $35 using code James and I
think those will set you up for success
with
I shoulda look you want to do for my
silence today I'm gonna be using the 35b
palette I'm bursting at Miami for 401
which is the biggest fluffy brush and
dip into the yellow shade in the bottom
corner for this particular look our
yellow is going to act as our transition
shade holding the brush at an upward
angle I'm gonna go in right into my
crease and start using a circular
motions to place that shadow right up in
there and to blend it out when applying
the shadows I'm making sure to pack the
color right in the crease and then doing
my circular motions to blend them out
this will make sure that the shadow
doesn't get all the way up to the brow
bone and look muddy and unblended
because that is obviously not what we
want you want to keep the yellow up here
in order to make a nice transition
between skintone color and then your
crease next we're gonna move on to our
darker shade which in this case is going
to be our orange so to do this I'm gonna
grab my am 4-3-3 which like I was saying
is my favorite a crease brush and I'm
gonna dip into the bright orange shade
I'm still gonna hold my brush at a
slight upward angle but I'm gonna hold
this one a lot more horizontal to my
face and is staying exactly where we
want it in the crease and the outside
bristles of the brush are gonna do the
job of blending it into that yellow
shade without bringing it all the way up
to the brow bone so much of the yellow
sheet I'm going to Pat that shadow in
there to make sure it's very very
pigmented and then just do a mix of
windshield wiper motions and small
circular motions to make sure it is
evenly it blended out it's really
important to keep in mind the pressure
that you're using on your brush
throughout your entire makeup process
you want to use heavier pressure when
applying the shadows to make sure that
they really get pressed in there so
they're pigmented but when you're
blending them out you want to use super
super light pressure I mean I'm
literally barely even touching my eyelid
at this point it is just the tips of the
bristles that are running against it
that are really gonna make everything
blended together without placing any new
product on there once you're happy with
that blending to make sure it's really
perfect I'm gonna go back into my
original transition shade brush dip into
a little bit more yellow
tap off any excess and then go right
over the border between the orange and
the yellow to make sure that everything
is blended together and that the yellow
doesn't get lost in all of the blending
and brush work our next darker shade is
going to be our red so once again I'm
gonna grab another and 4-3-3 brush and
dip into the wrench
right up in here when I hiding this
color I am actually holding the brush
almost completely horizontal to my face
to make sure that the color gets
distributed into exactly the crease and
the crease only and doesn't get blended
anywheres upwards
I'm next going to go back into my end
first there is either how the orange
shade on it and blend right over that
red in between to make sure that the
orange doesn't get lost and to ensure
that there is an even transition between
the yellow and the red it takes a lot of
practice a lot of patience and a lot of
time to really master the art of
blending and the best way to do it is to
really go in and make sure that every
color is blended seamlessly together and
not cutting any corners next is gonna be
our final color which is dark purple so
for this I'm gonna grab Miami 506 which
is that tiny little fluffy brush and dip
it to the cool tone of dark purple shade
right up in here when I go into my
darker shade of eyeshadow whether it be
a purple black dark blue or even maroon
I always like to start off in the outer
corner because that's where I really
want most of the product to be a focus
and when I grab the product always make
sure to not really put a lot on my brush
as you can see I really just packed it
in there and barely anything showed up
but that's what we want my best i shadow
tip for you guys to do it would be apply
a little bit of product blend it out and
then see if you need more and if you do
that add more product and slowly build
your way up the worst thing you can do
is sort of dark and try to fix it
because there's usually no going back
I'm applying the shadow carefully in my
outer V which is just basically like
this socket where you general right up
and here where your eye sits I did get a
few questions on how to sketch it out
but literally just imagine that there's
a V from the corner of your eye right up
into your crease if they were to connect
and that is where you should put your
outer V and then whatever excess shadow
I have left I'm just going to drag that
into the crease just to provide a little
bit of dimension you guys should know
the joke this point driving my red and
4-3-3 it gonna blend right over the edge
make sure that the purple doesn't get
too intense and we don't lose that red
and then finally our yellow we get to
take a break from the shadow for a few
short minutes because now we get to the
fun part cutting at the crease you guys
know I love about half cut crease and is
all my all-time favorite makeup looks to
do and I'm going to show you guys how I
do mine today the most common question I
get when it comes to cut creases is
where do you put the crease and that is
a honestly really
question that I still at 100% not sure
the answer to if you grab the end of
your brush and lightly lightly poke
around your eye area you should actually
be able to feel your crease and is the
kind of squishy area that you can push
in right here right in between your brow
bone which you obviously can't push in
and your eyeball which you shouldn't
push in because I'm not trying to get
sued if you go blind tain once again my
full cover concealer I'm gonna put a
dollop of it on the back of my hand and
I'm gonna grab at Miami two to four
brush which is that flat concealer brush
that I was telling you guys about
I freaking love this you can use this
for concealer or packing a shadow onto
the lid or glitter you just need one of
these in your collection I'm gonna dip
it right into that concealer and before
actually going into the eye I'm going to
lightly dab off any excess because the
last thing you want is to place it on
there and get a clump and mess
everything up it's happened to me don't
do it
once you're all ready to go I'm gonna
tilt my head up and backwards so I can
look into the mirror and have all of my
eyelid a pletely accessible and there
are no wrinkles I'm gonna place my brush
right in there and I'm just going to
follow the shape of my crease once we're
happy with the shape and the concealer
is all tacky I'm gonna quickly grab my
Emma to a fire brush or just any tiny
packing brush and go right back into the
shadow and I'm going to do the eyelid
I'm Burstyn are going to be white in the
top corner and I'm gonna pack this right
on at the inner corner of the eye then
with that same exact brush grabbing the
yellow and packing that right next door
do not necessarily worry about the
blending either by topping into the
colors that Kleiza they're gonna kind of
blend naturally and since the concealer
is wet you have to work fast then
grabbing the orange then the red and
then finally the purple connecting it
right into that outer V as you guys can
see even while packing these shades on
there I still have my head tilted
backwards which might look crazy but I
promise you this makes it so much easier
to get full access to your eyelid and
make sure that you don't get any shadow
where you don't want it to be and you
get it right up to that crease line
similar to up here how we kept going
back in with each individual color after
the factory share was blended I'm gonna
do the same exact thing
so I'm gonna go back into my red and top
right over that transition area down the
orange before we do the yellow I do want
to add a little bit of a metallic shade
on the inner corner just for a little
pop of shimmer and for this I'm gonna
use the Tarte chrome paint in the shade
at top yacht I love this one I just
under grab a tiny little brush and I'm
going to get it right on there and the
one tip I have for you guys when it
comes to it metallic shadows is to give
your brush a good spritz a fixed plus or
any setting spray and then pack it on
and it's gonna really make it shine now
I'm gonna go back into the yellow and go
right over the edge of the two of those
colors and you guys that is the upper
shadow I'll complete see not that that
when you really break it down we're
gonna take a break from shadow for a
second and move on to the winged liner
probably right behind it cut crease a
good Hwang's liner is probably one of
the hardest techniques to do and makeup
but I'm going to show you guys a few
tips and tricks to really get your wings
snatched ready to cut someone and
hopefully very even there are many
different products in the makeup world
that you can use to create a winged
liner
some people like a pencil I do not some
people like a gel liner with a brush I
do not some people like a liquid liner
with like bristles I sometimes do but
really did not what I really like to use
is a felt tip liner for today I'm gonna
use the Marc Jacobs - felt tip liner
just like this and it's basically a tiny
little marker this one is $58 which you
definitely didn't have to buy I get that
as ridiculously expensive
I know Maybelline has a literally good
and so does Kat Von D but basically
you're gonna want to use a felt tip
liner if you are like me and you
struggle with this because it makes it
so much easier the most common question
I get when it comes to winged liner is
how do you get them to be even let's be
real we all have days where our
eyeliners are like not even distant
cousins let alone sisters let alone
twins but there is one half that I have
for you guys that's really gonna
hopefully step up your eyeliner game and
that is follow the shape of your eyes
when drawing in the bottom line of your
way you're gonna want to imagine as if
your waterline
continued so as you can see here my
writer line goes all the way around goes
up and then my winged eyeliner looks
like it's a continuation and it follows
that same exact shape it is a slight
angle upwards which gives my eyes a nice
left a lot of people tend to draw their
wings straight out which
done correctly can give a really cool
editorial look but oftentimes on certain
shapes it tends to make the eyes droop
and look saggy for some reason a lot of
people tend to draw their wings straight
up which is literally flattering on
nobodies my shape unless your eyes are
literal like circles where the liner
would make sense to keep following the
shape please to not draw your eyeliner
straight up it does not belong there
taking my eyeliner pen and giving it a
good shake to make sure that there's a
lot of product in the bristles I'm going
to go towards the corner of my eye and
I'm going to kind of rest my elbow on my
chest to make sure my arm is not going
anywhere and I'm going to start right at
the outer corner and I'm gonna draw a
line upwards following the shape of my
waterline similar to the brows if it's
messy it's okay because we're gonna
clean it up after once I have that
bottom line sketch in we are golden
we're good to go
I'm just gonna take it and I'm going to
drag that line right back down to the
lashes once the wing is in place all you
have to do is lightly place that felt
tip right on the base of your lashes and
just lightly drag all the way across to
finish off that winged liner with a
general rule keeping in mind that it
should start off a super super thin in
the inner corner and get thicker as it
gets to this portion and then of course
thin out of the wings once we're happy
with the overall statement the wing
following the theme of this video now we
get to clean it up I'm gonna grab my
flat top concealer brush once again a
little bit more shape tape concealer and
I'm just going to carefully go right
below that wing and carve it out I'm
also gonna take the excess concealer on
the brush and blend it downwards over
top of some of this eyeshadow that ended
up back here you don't need to do this
it's just personal preference that I
really like a cut and clean line when it
comes to my eye shadow looks of this
kind of style the hard part is over
thank God
jumping back into the shadow quickly to
finish off the lower lash line we're
just gonna replicate the same exact
colors that we did on the top on the
bottom covering a little smaller brush
this is the am up to 13 and the dark
purple shade I'm just gonna press this
right up against the waterline and then
making sure to lightly drag out and
connect it with that wing up because
nothing it looks weirder than when you
have shadow blended out and there's just
like a harsh divide right here don't do
that I'm gonna grab that pencil brush I
was talking about and dipper
into the red shadow and he's it to blend
out that purple and finally just gonna
have a 9 4 3 3 antipodal a little bit of
orange and a little bit of yellow and
just blend right now the last and final
step before moving on to the lashes is
going to be water lines and if you guys
are a true sister you would note that I
literally hate them doing my waterline
is by far my least favorite stab at my
makeup routine I hate it I have never
liked it and if you have sensitive or
watery eyes like me you might as well
just skip it altogether and has truly
saved the life of my makeup routine I
have never once wore black eyeliner and
my upper waterline and not have it be
ridiculously uncomfortable and transfer
to my lower lash line by the end of the
night so just skip it most helpful
makeup tip you'll ever receive as for
the lower waterline though gal I love
her there are so many things you can put
on there a pop color for a fun look my
priscilla favorite is a nude liner this
one is from pretty vulgar and I just
love this using a nude liner in your
waterline it's gonna really open up your
eyes make them pop and make them look
bigger you guys know I love a good
doll-like makeup look and I really
really love the nude aforethought as you
can see it just looks so nice you can of
course use a black liner as well for a
more sultry sexy look but just keep in
mind using a black is gonna make your
eyes appear smaller so Blinder waterline
accordingly and last but finally
certainly not least is going to be the
lashes the first step of applying lashes
is always to give them a good curl using
whatever color you want I think this one
was like $2 from CVS and the only tip I
have for this one is make sure you're
getting right up to the root of the lash
right at your lash liner for the best
curl our next step of course is gonna be
a good coat of mascara and for today's
video I am so excited to be partnering
with NYX Cosmetics to show you guys
they're brand new worth the hype mascara
this is just launched a few weeks ago is
available now in most drugstores is
literally eight dollars hello and is so
good you guys know I don't really do a
whole lot of sponsored videos on this
channel it is pretty rare for me but
I've been testing this mascara out for
the past week or so and I really really
like it and I'm so excited to show you
it today going into the wand once again
I'm gonna tell my head back so I have a
really easy access
my lashes I'm gonna start by bringing
this one in starting right at the root
of the lash almost in my upper waterline
and just wiggling it upwards going from
root to tip of the lash and wiggling
your wand all around you will also make
sure that all of ours are evenly coated
which is obviously ideal and as long and
beautiful as they can possibly be I
really really like it's about scared
because it's of a luminizing mascara and
obviously who doesn't love a little bit
more volume a little bit more dimension
and their lashes I love a good
voluminous new mascara but often times
it'll leave my lashes looking really
really clumpy but as you can see if I
look down they look nice and separated
and so beautiful and also the front of
this is really really black which is
literally the best ever oh hello look at
how good my bottom lashes look oh my god
NYX
thank you for partnering with you on
this video and sisters do you know what
to do go check it out it's worth the
hype okay so if you guys are looking for
an everyday and natural look when it
comes to your lashes at least you could
totally stop right here with just a good
curl and mascara it looks beautiful and
stunning but if you're like me and you
want a little bit more drama a little
bit of a bigger impact today we're gonna
do some falsies for today's look I'm
gonna go in you guessed it the Lily
lashes in the style of Miami these are
my all-time favorite false lashes and I
really really like them because they're
super super wispy they're not too dense
so you can still see the eye shadow
underneath and they're also not too long
for my eyes it's really important to
keep your actual eye shape and the shape
of eyes shadow that you're planning for
in mind when picking out a pair of
lashes obviously there are millions of
different styles of lashes out there but
I like to group them into two different
categories which I like to call either
symmetrical lashes or asymmetrical
lashes Lily lashes miami's are
symmetrical lashes in my book because at
the longest point they are all the same
exact length an asymmetrical ma should
be a lash that is small on the inner
corner but the lashes get longer and
longer and longer as they go out towards
the outer portion of your eye and they
flare up I definitely prefer wearing
asymmetrical last because I feel like it
gives a very very doll-like appearance
it makes your eyes look very very round
whereas an asymmetrical lash
really accentuates almond eyes and makes
them kind of look more like snatched and
hold which is also a really beautiful
look as well it just depends on what
kind of look you're going for once you
have your lashes all picked
and ready to go I'm gonna grab a pair of
tweezers and I'm going to pull them out
of the pocket very very carefully
most lodges are pretty expensive so
you're gonna want to be gentle and
pulling them out of the package because
the last thing that you want to do is
spend $30 on a pair of lashes and then
we're about half the hairs each hair is
like 50 cents in here now the absolute
biggest mistake that people make when
putting on a pair of falsies is taking
them right out of the box and popping
them right on the eye please do not do
that if your lashes are poking you if
they are tickling you if they are flying
off in the inner corner it is because
you have an eyelash glued on where there
should not be an eyelash glued on nobody
has big enough eyes to ever glue on this
big of an eyelash to your eye trim your
eyelashes and your application and your
entire life will be a million times
better the best way to figure out how to
trim your eyelashes and what length is
going to work best for your eye shape is
to take them out of the box and put them
on your eye but without any glue the
tackiness from whatever was sticking at
the lash to the box should be enough to
keep the lash on your eyelid and kind of
get a sense for the measurement grab
over my lashes in the center tightly by
a pair of tweezers I'm gonna grab my
tiny pair of eyelash scissors and I'm
going to trim off the ends for me
personally I like to trim off one spike
on one and two spikes on the other end
which definitely made a huge difference
in the size and although this may look
small the other lashes that we put
mascara on are gonna do a great job of
blending together the false lash with
the real one and this is gonna look a
whole lot better than that
overwhelming lash from before to pilot
lashes today I'm going to be using the
duo brush on adhesive I love this lash
glue this stuff is so Bob you need it in
your life I'm just gonna go ahead and
open it up and paint a light layer of
glue right on the lash band this glue
dries pretty quickly and it goes on blue
so once it turns clear you know it's
ready to apply so I'm just gonna shake
it around a little bit and I'm gonna
hold a mirror and just like this one
kind of below my face at a very very
weird angle trust me on this I'm gonna
look in my mirror from below me and I'm
gonna place the lash on top of my lid
from an upward
angle I'm gonna go to my tweezers and
then just pull on both ends and make
sure that the actual lash bed is in
contact with my lash line
that's why holding the mirror from below
is super super helpful because you can
actually see what you're doing is that
I'm just trying to estimate it once our
last bet is all glued on there we have
our last step but probably our most
important step and please be careful
while doing this do not poke your eyes
out go in super close up to your eyelid
with your pair of tweezers and go in and
pinch together right up against your
lash line the false lashes with your
real lashes and doing this is not only
gonna make the lashes blend together and
look more real but because the mascara
is slightly tacky still it's gonna
really stick the lashes together so
you're laugh-in will stay on all day
long and there we go guys our lashes
officially on secured pinch together not
going anywhere and looking so so so good
lashes like I was saying is by far one
of the hardest halves of any makeup
routine I struggle with them for so long
can't even tell you how many times I
glued my eye shot far too many and
flashes are saying that you struggle
with literally just grab a pair of
falsies from like CVS or Walgreens and
just sit in front of your mirror and
practice gluing them on with no other
makeup on so you don't mess anything up
and I promise if you try out these
strategies and tips and techniques you
will eventually get way better at it but
once you have it all down we love a good
sister lash where their lashes done I
think that actually completes our eye
look for today so I'm gonna quickly
throw on a lip add some setting spray
and I'll be right back to finish off
this video all right sisters then here
