surprised that something went wrong

of all of our hearts thank you guys so

been working on this cover and many
other covers that will soon be coming

now and we were so excited and nervous
to share this with you guys so I really

very very huge part of my life that I've
never really openly talked to you guys
about until recently so I'm so excited
that I finally get to share more about

thought I would do it on behalf of them

beautiful sister she has named Zoe D
Andrea and she is our power alto and
last but certainly not least we have
