motherfucking trap
hi guys it's James girls welcome back to
my youtube channel so it is December
meaning it is officially holiday season
and whether what you celebrate I am so
freaking excited
I personally celebrate Christmas I am so
shattered to state my family and all my
friends and gave everybody the cute
little gear so I've been planning out oh
I just really really really cannot wait
I asked you guys on Twitter what you
wanted to see this week and a few you
guys said a drag makeup tutorial I've
only done drag a few times and
unfortunately for me they're all
documented on my Instagram page I mean
we definitely started from the bottom
but now we here so it's all good and I
am so frickin happy with how this look
turned out so in honor of the our
holiday season I decide to is mrs. Claus
inspired hohoho drag makeup look this
look was super easy and so glad you
could literally wear anywhere like your
office Christmas party going out with
friends opening presents under the tree
with your family like this look is like
the definition of wearable glam
I know my dumbass forgot to say this
when I first started I decided to do my
base and eyebrows off-camera it is so
complicated and if you want to see my
drive base with cover brows tutorial
just go watch my Halloween if bunny
makeup I did everything there so if
you'd like to see how I created this
makeup look trust me a lot went into it
you're gonna want to sit down by the
fire with a warm cup of hot chocolate
make sure you keep on watching first
thing start off by taking this angled
brow brush from Sigma is the e 80 and
I'm going to dip into wine and dine from
the apply lip gloss holy girl eyes
shadow palette I'm going to using mainly
this palette today for deep cut priests
actually gonna take my morphe m4 33
again and wine and dine and I'm just
going to dip in and start to blend out
this line next I'm using my m5 14 it
back in wine and dine I'm going to
deepen up that area a little bit and
then once again using that m4 / 1/2 it
diffuse those edges next I'm taking the
shade of teddy bear on Miami 5 6 - and
I'm going to deepen up that crease and
I'm going to concentrate it mostly on
this inner region I don't know what else
to call it
and then switching back to that M 514
I'm going to blend that out using wine
and dine
and then just too deep it up this part a
little bit more I'm going to grab the
black shader from the 35 K palette and
Miami 5 6 - to clean up this idle going
to take my Kat Von D a whiteout
concealer on my Mac 242 and just go
right under the edge to begin sketching
out my line I'm going to use of course
the Kat Von D liquid liner in the shade
at trooper ok so I did a very important
job of cleaning that obviously liner is
something that is really personal to
every different drag look and you really
have to figure out what shape fits your
eyes best this is the one that I have
figured out works best for me it's very
like long and slender the same shape
might not work best for you so like I
said experiment but I just did a line
for my outer corner up to right
underneath the cut crease and then
followed right above my natural eyelid
crease and then I drew it in it let me
get it closer to home I drew it a little
bit past my inner corner and then I
connected it back in so we got this type
of situation going on the wing is all
shaped out I'm going to fill it in using
my NYC liquid liner obviously in the
shade of black this is a great direction
liner energized matte so it'll be
perfect for the situation make sure when
you're feeling this then you get really
close up to your waterline - you don't
want there to be like a line of skin
between your huge a swing and your
lashes to start off the lower lash line
I'm gonna grab my next double eye pencil
in milk and I'm going to color in my
waterline
and then govern my Mac 242 again I'm
going to grab the white shade from the
35k I'm going to pack that on top just
to set that in a place on Miami 213 I'm
going to take wine and dine once again
I'm going to start sketching out my
bottom lash line let me take Miami 514
with you guessed it wine and diet and
I'm going to buff out that line a little
bit and then taking Miami 562 in the
shade of teddy bear to it deep enough in
the outer corner and then finally just
like the upper lash line my om 1 4 9 and
the Block on the 35 K and I'm just going
to connect with the wing to the lower
lash line I really want to ask I do this
because I feel like this is exactly the
same as every other job look I've
literally ever done so I'm going to take
my Urban Decay primer potion because I
cannot find my glitter primer and I'm
going to use my makeup geek sparkler in
the shade asteroid to add some glitter
tears turn off my bra so gonna grab my
anasazi a broad brush in number 12 and
this shade right here for my 35 K
palette and just begin to kind of sketch
them out and then when I get more
towards the front I'm going to just kind
of grab that color and I'm going to
lightly fade it in I really want that
ombre effect in my brows and if I go too
harshly like my chest into that line
we're not going to get that and once
again I'm going to take my yet cap on D
whiteout concealer on my 242 and I'm
going to clean up right underneath that
brow with that same brush going to go
with you whitey from the 35 K
to start my lashes I'm going to curl
them and then foremost here and today
I'm going to using the covergirl Sol
ashy mascara since I am a man doing a
mrs. Claus look I figured this would be
the perfect quality promoting mascara to
finish off the eyes today I'm going to
be putting on some lashes and I'm going
to be stacking together two pairs from
the makeup shock they're in the style I
happing and matte eye I don't really
have any like actual dried lashes so
these are the biggest ones I could find
I am praying that they work I describe
these Lena lashes in the style in a ona
and I cut the strand right in half so
I'm just going to pop this on the outer
corner to add a little bit more volume
out there alright guys that is one eye
I'll complete I'm going to go and do the
other one off-camera or else we would
literally be sitting here and talk
Christmas time so I'll be right back we
can move on with the rest of the face
BAM there we go both eyes are done it is
a Christmas miracle let's go ahead and
move on my next time is going to be to
highlight my face no usually I feel like
my drag looks are always kind of like
Matt I feel like drag is just like a
matte Spore I mean when you're on stage
like performing the last thing you want
is to be dripping your makeup off but
since we are miss class today and we're
just going to be taking pictures and
filming this video for you guys I did
want to add just a little bit of a pop
so I'm going to go to the artist Couture
Coco bling on my morphe m 501 and
remember you can use code James for 10%
off your order this holiday season
and always but it's a good time to buy
right oh I already added blush when I
did my base off-camera but I want to add
a little bit more just to kind of blend
the highlight on the contour together
because as we know dry makeup is a
pretty intense so blending is key and I
go using the Mac Salina blush from the
new collection in the shade you've got
me feeling in my more BM 509 brush
alright just off the lips today I'm
going to using the Too Faced melted
matte liquid lipstick in the shade of
drop dead red and of course we're going
to over line the crap out of them
okay the makeup is complete this is the
look I really really have this turned
out I'm going to go in quickly throw on
a wig and some accessories so we can
finish up this video mrs. Claus is
trembling right now oh alright guys and
this is the completed mrs. Claus
inspired drag glam perfect for the
upcoming holiday season I've only done
drag a few times down but I've been
practicing a lot and I feel like this is
by far the best I have ever looked I am
so excited I'm so proud of this look I
feel like I could literally walk on
stage of RuPaul's Drag Race Season ten
right now
audition and the only thing Michelle
visage should be able to clock will be
my neck not touching my chest if you

the art of drag it is totally different
than my everyday makeup style so it's so
much fun to experiment and see what I
can come up with because it's definitely
not the easiest thing in the world thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you next time in happy holidays
bye so I'm just going to be honest why
mrs. Claus's topless and if you're
really wondering mr. Claus spent all of
our money on presents this year so
unfortunately the $50 slutty Santa top
from Target did not fit the budget I
would like it to be all that these
earrings are actually ornaments from my
Christmas tree and I glued them on to my
ears with nail glue so when I rip them
off my ears are definitely gonna bleed
umm just letting you know that I'm
dedicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
