hi guys its James Charles welcome back
to my channel so today I'm going to show
you guys how I created this makeup look
I want with a Ryder Cup crease on the
top and a very dark and grainy blue
chunky glitter look on the bottom I
absolutely love this look it's perfect
for any of our festival season now this
look is inspired by a by Brooke hell if
you don't follow her on Instagram oh my
god you really need to her looks are
phenomenal and they're really something
else but full credit goes to her for
this look idea if you want to learn how
to recreate this look for yourself make
sure to keep on watching so I already
went ahead and did my base and eyebrows
off camera just because this look is
really focus on the eyes and the lips so
I wanted to make that the main part of
the video and you guys system you my
base several times in my routine is
still exactly the same so let's just
skip it and move right along look at the
upper eyelid I'm gonna be using the
Anasazi of Modern Renaissance palette
I'm starting out by taking tempera and
AM or PM 513 run and just dusting this
in the crease and over the upper eyelid
this is just kind of your like my base
card set my eyelid primer in place is to
make sure everything blends really
really nicely then on the same brush I
will be taking the burnt orange and just
ousting a little bit of it in my crease
to begin the transition color for a
little bit more definition I'm going to
dip into Rio gar in my morphe and a
4-3-3 brush and I'm going to further
define at the crease oh jesus comes a
lot I'm going to further to find the
crease just a little bit of probably a
lot of it now normally when we do smokey
eyes obviously we're not very concerned
about getting it on the lid but with
this I'm kind of blend upwards with that
color because we are going to be kind of
cutting the lid with a little bit of a
champagne eyeshadow once I have all over
over on there I'm going to go back in
with my m5 13 and just buff out those
edges we recently hit 40,000 subscribers
on this channel which is really freaking
cool considering I have six videos in
and probably the shittiest most and
active youtuber ever so thanks for that
I promise maybe in the future there is a
chance slightly that I will make more
videos who knows really want to make
sure the blue in the orange will blend
well together and nothing looks
like define harsh so I am just trying a
little bit of that excess product into
this inner corner nose region I'm now
taking my morphe m56 2 and red ochre and
I'm just going to deepen up the crease a
little bit if you guys are interested in
testing out any more great products you
can use the code James for 10% off all
orders I would seriously recommend them
they're really affordable and super
great quality once we have red oak
replace in the crease I'm going to go
back into my ed 433 and just blend that
out a little bit I'm now just taking
that same n 5/6 to brush and dipping
into Cypress umber and real car and
mixing it together to create a warm
brown shade just find the crease a
little bit more once again just taking
the m4 33 and blending it out
well these types have really blown out
colorful looks like this it's always
important to really really blend blend
blend blend blend
I always said ah because it's like
number one will look makeup duh but when
you have colors that are going to be
going everywhere it's so more than that
there are no harsh lines that everything
is really blended out or else you will
not get the effect that you're looking
for I'm going to use a spot tail brush
for my Fink BH Cosmetics I really have
no idea the name rubbed off so that's
going to be my guest first today I'm
going to dampen my brush just using my
everything I all-night our settings by
it usually I could we use like fix+ or
make up forever mist and fix but I can't
find either so I just did my brush into
a Primavera and Vermeer mixing it
together to create like a golden
champagne type color and I'm now going
to cut my lid using this brush
and I'm also going to take a mix of
those two and pop it under my brow bones
to give a nice little highlight once I
have that color place on there I'm just
going back into my more vm4 3 3 and I
just went to lightly diffuse that outer
edge of the lid just so it kind of
blends into the crease a little bit and
that is the upper lid all completely
let's go ahead and move on to the fun
pop of color on the bottom so for the
pop of color under my eyes today I'm
going to using my morphe 35c as usual
you guys know this is my holy grail for
all my colored looks and I'm going to
using these two shades right there to
start off with the pop of color I'm
going to go in with my M three-30 brush
from morphe which is a fluffy crease
brush and just begin to place that color
down there when you're doing looks like
this is really important to start
lightly and kind of build up the color
you don't want too much pigmentation
right away just because when you're
doing a really blown off things you want
the edges to be nice and like faded and
smoothly transition into your skin tone
if that makes any sense so I'm just
going in really lately and I'm going to
build up using some rubber colors in a
second and I am blending the shadows
much lower than I usually would not
taking that same brush and dipping into
a little bit more color and now I'm
going to start to color in the inner
corner once again just placing that
color on there lately and building up
and I'm going to high drag this upwards
into with you red like I said before
I'm not going to take my sigma e35 and a
little bit of that navy blue shade and
start to define this area a little bit
more under the lash line to define my
lower lash line I run out of my morphe
m14 line rush and I mixed together the
black and navy blue and really dark
green colors from the palette and pop
them right under the lash line to
balance out the champagne and the brow
bone Holly I'm going to go to the little
bit of artists Couture highlight and
mermaid fantasy to highlight the inner
corner I'm just going to quickly get up
on some mascara onto the upper lashes
and you guessed it I'm using benefit
roller lash and that completes the
shadow portion of the eye I just popped
on Gigi lashes from Lena lashes I'm
going to go ahead now and do the other
eye off-camera and we can finish off
with the glitter highlighter and lips
now I'm going to want to get my skin a
little bit of glow using my morphe m5o
one brush and anasazi have so Hollywood
I'm just doing kind of like a stubble
some subtle subtle understand a more
subtle look today because obviously the
focus is on the eyes I don't want to
take away from that for lips today I'm
going to be using Oprah the bronze
liquid lipstick this is just a matte
black liquid lip you can use any matte
black that you like but I'm going to
layer over this with a highlighter so
you can get that metallic blue green
type pigment
now that we have the lipstick all on I'm
going to go to the artist go to our
mermaid fantasy highlighter just to add
a metallic duochrome machine to the lips
in there we go that is the look mostly
complete you could totally stop here if
you wanted to just wear this colorful
look out but this is a chunky glitter
tutorial so y'all know I can't forget my
chunky glitter today I'm gonna be using
these recollections glitter that I found
it Michaels the crafts Rosses peacock
mix and bling I'm just going to be
mixing the two different shades of
glitter together to apply the glitter
I'm just going to be using a skeeto lash
glue and I'm going to make some dots all
under my eye when I'm going to put the
glitter and then I'm just going to press
it all on with my fingers if there are
any letters that you really want and you
can't get your finger in there you can
always just use a pair of tweezers I'm
just placing the glue dots completely
randomly I don't want any of them to be
symmetrical to the other side same thing
just things that are on my fingers I'm
going to press it right onto the eye and
it will stick to wherever we put the
glue and now that we have half the damn
bottle under our eyes I'm going to go
back in with a pair of tweezers and just
pick off any glitters that are like to
credit or just I feel like are in the
wrong area
