welcome back it's my youtube channel
first today's the day we're doing
something that I actually have not done
in a very very very long time and that
is a review and it fills you guys who
have been watching me for a while you
know that I don't really like doing
reviews but mostly because of one
they're boring - I don't release which
up my beauty routine that often and
three the general public is convinced
that beauty gurus are literally spawns
of Satan and were sent down to earth to
literally fool everybody and lied to
them into buying copy products a few
days ago I was doing some sisters
shopping the play stylist online to pick
up some really cute summer clothes and I
was on ASOS which if you don't know what
that is it is a really really cute
online clothing retailer how I can not
sponsored by shag should be and I
actually came across the beauty section
on their website and found out something
that had me shook to the core and that
was that
Crayola the crayon company that we all
used to draw with when we were kids came
out with a full-on makeup line at first
sitting there I was very much sister
stumped on why the heck and our supplies
company would release a makeup line but
then I remembered it's kind of within
the same realm and you guys just saw me
do my full face using only art supplies
a few weeks ago and clearly the actual
products worked out pretty well so it
might not be that strange of a business
move for them but regardless I bought
the entire collection today I'm very
very very excited to see how these
products actually test out will they be
good or will they literally be like
crayons on my face we're gonna find out
so without further ado let's jump right
into the video
so lonely isotopes that made to search
the Crayola and it looks at that they
launched 57 different items at the
collection which is actually like very
very large I deftly picked up a lot of
different things today that I'm excited
to try out and there are things on this
website ranging from brushes to
eyeshadow palettes to mascaras to
highlighters to face crayons which I'm
have no idea what that a is but I guess
we're going to find out so starting off
I picked up two different eyeshadow
palettes that they launched right off
the bat I'm gonna say packaging
absolutely beautiful this rainbow moment
is so so so cute and I got the nude
eyeshadow palette and the mermaid
eyeshadow palette
France if you're watching this please
stop releasing mermaid and unicorn
themed items we are all over it this has
been a PSA the palette sweet offer $29
and they come with ten shadows and each
kit meaning each shadow is $2.90 Wow I
love being at the queen of math and
they're actually both cruelty free and
vegan which is really really great I
also picked up the Crayola face palette
which once again retails for at $29 and
contains 10 different oh this is the
face palette I really thought this is
going to contain a contouring color I
grabbed their customizable lip palette
which is $35 and once again contains 10
different sheets perfect for mixing I am
very very excited to try to sell it
later on I don't know if any you guys
know this or if ever tried it but
honestly Beverly Hills actually has a
really really great formula for their
customisable lip palette so I'm gonna be
very interested to see how this performs
and comparison to that one I grab the
highlighter crayon and the shade
shimmering blush and this one was $17.50
which looks like this interesting I'm a
little bit scared to put this over top
of my foundation but we're gonna make it
work hopefully I grab two different
mascaras in black and navy blue and
these retail for sixteen dollars but the
years of the collection for me what a
little bit sister sell good Laura I
picked up some of the Crayola face
crayons and I grabbed a yellow a block a
white a mango color of blue of red and a
nude color just to try out different eye
looks today now these look great on the
website they retail for $14.50 now to me
if this price hike seems a little bit
high bring their you're only getting
point 0 7 ounces of product for $14.50
and I know for a fact that milk sells
their jumbo eye pencils for like $6
which is literally like the same exact
product hello I literally spent 101
dollars and 50 cents on all seven of
these eye pencils and what I find even
more ridiculous is that you can
literally go to the craft store and buy
a 96 packet of crayons which are
probably let's be honest the exact same
thing was this for nine dollars I got 96
crayons for nine dollars and I got seven
i crayons for a hundred and $1.50
something does not add up here if you
ask me and finally my last purchase of
this collection is probably the worst of
all them being this Crayola Beauty make
up a brush set in case now when I saw
this brush out online originally I was
like wow is so cute look at this brush
keys are you kidding me at holographic
Crayola Gorge and then I bought it for
$40 and I opened it up to find
this for eyeshadow brushes for Quattro I
don't think so
before we go ahead and actually start my
look today I thought we should do some
sister swatches of the different eye
crayons because these are really what
I'm most excited to see how the heck of
these perform so let's start off with
the shade white oh okay so it's
definitely a very very creamy formula
thank God it doesn't feel like an actual
crayon on my arm we have the shade
dandelion so cute that these are
actually matching to the real names of
the Crayola pencils putting these on
they actually feel kind of like oily to
apply I really thought that are gonna be
a lot more like hard I definitely
interested to see if these are going to
try down because they definitely do it
transfer as you can see it kind of feels
like you're playing a lip stick to your
arm whereas I felt like they're gonna be
a lot more dry next we have the shade at
Mango Tango okay I guess this one is a
little bit sparkly that's kind of pretty
I doesn't want to try to use that one as
a blush next we have the shade of red oh
wow that you're kidding that was with
literally zero pressure yeah these are a
really sister soft this is like a
lipstick wow that did not last long this
is a mess alright next I picked up the
shade and navy blue this one also has a
little bit of sparkle to it as well
that's a really pretty color not gonna
lie I wanna use on the lower lash line I
also picked up the shade desert sand
which is like a little nudie color I
would got this for out the waterline and
this is really really pretty and then
finally of course I got why but I think
the worst block that I've ever swatch in
my entire life what is that you'd think
of all the colors the block would be
like the best one if anything okay I'm a
little bit sister spooked
after these swatches but you know what I
want to see how this is gonna turn out
let's just jump right in
I'm gonna first grab the base palette
because I'm looking a little bit flat
right now and I'm literally scared and
I'm going to attempt to contour somehow
I'm first gonna grab the blush brush
from this collection and grab I think
this shade or right over here and try to
contour this let's see luckily there's a
mirror in here which is actually really
helpful it's not like bad it's just like
not there I was definitely right in the
beginning when I said that this palette
deftly does not have a contour option
which is hello it's a face palette I'm
gonna grab my Calvin D shade of light
palette and just contour them I'm gonna
go back to that in 30 seconds for blush
and highlight and the full shebang okay
we're back with our regularly scheduled
programming did you miss me I know you
did I'm gonna grab the blush brush once
again I'm gonna dip into this kind of
metallic e coral copper shade down here
it actually look
very very sunny I want to try to use
this for at blush today so once again
it's not showing up can you see that
what's going on why is it not showing up
with my face oh there it is
okay it's their shoes that are shaking
into the party oh I love that okay
I feel like this blush shade is like
absolutely perfect for a really
beautiful bronze look for the summer
time to kind of transition your bronzer
to your highlight I really actually like
to shade a lot oh my god Wow okay cool
great love that you guys might like to
do highlighter earlier on as well so I'm
gonna go back into the shade in a short
second I want to lay down this
highlighter stick as a base first this
is in the shade shimmering blushed and
once again I think this was $17.50 these
kind of remind me of like the milk
sticks and there it's barely there
come on Crayola this is like the texture
of what I thought the face creams were
gonna be like like this has that waxy
kind of more dry texture that I was
expecting and that does not look good
it's actually picking up the foundation
underneath which is definitely not good
do it does not look good
that is canceled a million percent and
sad what I'm gonna do is get my face a
white spritz of fix+ just like I always
do before I apply my highlighter and I'm
gonna get my morphe
501 brush and I'm gonna dip into this
shade right here in the face palette
which actually looks like a really
really pretty highlighter and let's try
out this instead okay not at that see
that looks good great love that the true
test here is can it snatch a sister
schnoz let's see that is the face all
complete we are chiseled out we added a
little bit of color and now we aren't
glowing from with Ana I'm actually
really really loving how this is looking
so far but I'm gonna bake my face and
set it in place and I'll be right back a
little bit closer up to start off the
eyes okay
literally about a sword in the eyeshadow
I'm literally luck the pocket it's
literally flying apart oh you're kidding
okay this is just getting worse and
worse and worse for the second we're
gonna pretend like that shadow didn't
just fall out of the entire package good
lord I'm scared okay
let's freakin do this thing at this
point I'm gonna start off with the nude
eyeshadow palette which is literally
falling apart at its seams I think I
really want to keep with the theme that
I have going on it's officially summer
time I know some of you guys are
graduating at congratulations by the way
so before I even talking to the
eyeshadow palette i actually
the yellow face cran and I think I want
to pop this in the inner corners like a
little fun a pop of color and see how it
actually it turns out it's actually
showing up on the skin surprisingly I
guess I'm just gonna grab like a
blending brush and see if I can buff
that out I hear they do blend thank God
oh wait no they don't
what the heck okay so the cranes
actually do blend out but it definitely
loses like almost all of its
pigmentation when you blend it and it
doesn't dry like it's still tacky
feeling this is not going well I'm gonna
put a little bit more on to bring some
of that color back similar to the
highlighter - it's actually taking off
the foundation from underneath the
crayon it still looks fine oh my god you
guys can't even oh wow hashtag for Cyril
problems when you buy too expensive hood
camera and it still looks good so
looking at the news power R or matte
shades and then six different shimmer
shades which is a very very bad ratio
there should never be more shimmer
shades in math sheets in a palette I
wanna grab that red crayon that
literally melts it off when it was
touching my hand and see if one I can
create an orange in the middle of this
eye look and also kind of wing this out
on oh my god why is this right doing
this let's grab the one eyeshadow brush
in the entire brush kit and try to blend
this out the sad thing is I'm like
actually really trying here like I don't
want to lost you from Crayola but I know
you can feel it coming okay that's not
that horrible what if I grab like a
regular morphe brush okay that's not
horrible it's like bad but like not the
worst me look at everything am i I
wonder if I grab a blending brush and
like a little bit of this oh okay that
actually works
okay what's actually really annoying is
that blending the red and the yellow
together like didn't make orange I
wonder if I put this mango shade in here
what that will do nothing it's gonna do
absolutely nothing apparently why can I
make orange like red plus yellow wow
look at me being an artiste oh we we
welcome to Patti
maybe these are supposed to be like use
when you're like not wearing makeup it's
like not like it just over like a eye
thing or like you like just put it on
the cheek like as like a light on the go
type of thing
this is just not good I think is the
conclusion that I'm coming to here okay
I wanna figure out to somehow finish
this I look and I want to do a house
quickly so I can check out some of the
shimmer shades in here because they are
so you look really really stunning and I
love the highlighter in the face palette
that we use beforehand so I'm gonna grab
my shape tip concealer I'm gonna cut out
the crease but I'm actually really
nervous to do this being that these
shadows are
and are not drying down in the slightest
bit so this might all get mixed together
and we're gonna find out in a few short
seconds I'm gonna grab my morphe I'm 2
to 4 brush and start off with this kind
of light gold shader right here at the
bottom and I'm gonna pack that on the
lid hello what the heck what like this
swatch so nicely where is this on the
arm hello
I do not see that do you I feel like I
need to treat you all I children right
now because we're doing a Crayola makeup
tutorial what is going on now that the
crease is all kind of caught I'm gonna
grab this like a metallic kind of ready
orange shade right here on a fluffy
brush and I want to use this to blend
out the outer edge into that red shadow
that we have going on I'm just gonna pop
this right here oh that's a good shot oh
okay not mad about it i doesn't want to
deepen up that outer V a little bit too
and add some more dimension so I'm just
gonna grab a Smith
235 brush and dip it it's this kind of
like muted grey tone up in this corner
I'm not sure how this is gonna turn out
let's just try those so be one of the
worst eye looks I've ever done and I'm
literally not even being dramatic yes I
am but I never want to use as much of
the colors as possible so we did get a
black crayon and I want to try to do a
winged liner with this which I know I'm
going to regret like you know what you
don't know unless you try why is this
black so sheer why would you ever want a
block that looks like this oh my god
this is also a cream so it's literally
not gonna dry down either
yeah what's the worse all right so that
is the upper lashline all complete and
it looks not good but let's move on to
the lower lash line I think I want to
add a pop of color because I really am
dying to try out this mermaid palette I
first wanted one of the crayon in the
shade navy blue first of all this is
like cherlene that color that we all
loved not dark blue I want to pop this
right up here for a fun pop of color and
see how this works see that's actually
really pretty like that I can get behind
we love great and then I'm gonna go a
mix of these two shades right up and
here with my morphe I'm at 149 brush and
use that to epochal right over top to
actually set in the shade because
cream eyeshadow is whether or not
Crayola knows they are
supposed to be set with something with
that same brush I want to dip into this
darker purple shade right up in here and
give Dada spreads a fix+ as well and
pack that on the outer corner because
purples are so pretty and I feel like
it's very very rare that you see like a
metallic purple and an eyeshadow palette
so I really want to test this out okay
you know what as much as I was making
fun of it the remain I showed up how a
hundred percent outperform the nude
palette this actually is really pretty I
just can't get over the fact that this
black eyeliner is literally like not
block who does that how would you ever
do that okay so I got this nude shade
desert sand to pop in the lash line so
we're gonna pop it in the lash line I
feel like that did like very I guess it
kind of worked okay
should I try white instead oh okay
that's actually a bomb white liner kind
of all right that is enough of the
eyeshadows I bought mascaras these were
16 dollars each I'm gonna start off with
the black one on the upper lashes and
see how this mascara actually it
performs
I like this wand a lot actually Wow as
if following this video literally could
not get any worse I am out of lash glue
a very BA
20 minutes later all right finally huh
that is what I look all completes
looking in the mirror I actually don't
hate how this turned out I feel like we
had a mission to go on and although we
may have failed I like the direction
that this is going in and I really want
to recreate this look sometime soon with
like a really good working a product
that being said this eyelid literally
took me 45 minutes to do and I still
don't feel like it's up to par the
blending is not great these cream
shadows still are not dried down which
is very very strange and it's just not
as bright and pigmented as those like
them to be that being said I'm gonna go
and do the other eye off-camera
really quickly and hopefully try to do
it a little bit faster and I'll be right
back to finish off the rest of this
Crayola all right hello i am back and
those are both eyes complete thank god
i'm gonna finish up my look today with a
lip so let's go ahead and grab the
custom lip palette i think i want to do
probably just like a nude lip I did a
rainbow I look so I think I need to like
balance out a little bit something you
thought I want to mix in this sheet
together right here with a pink to make
a slightly lighter nude um let's see how
this actually works under go this mouth
shape my down here mix it on my arm I
guess and then a little bit of this
white shade
well okay they definitely are really
creamy that's for sure which is great I
want to add a slight bit of yellow as
well and make it a little bit more
peachy tone let's try this what the heck
that is not what I wanted okay it kind
of tastes like like not good I'll ease
lip color ever for this look it's like a
bright Barbie baby pink like no that is
not what I wanted I wanted like a dark
nude how do I make that maybe like shad
Brown I would love to tell you how I got
to this color but I don't even know
myself all right guys I'm calling it
quits for this video today this review
has been something else
Crayola sweetie love you the most you
made my childhood pretty iconic but I
think we need to stick to our 96 crayons
for ten dollars because all this is not
working out overall this collection is
not absolutely the worst but I
definitely not recommend you guys to go
and run and spend your money on it these
face crayons I would have to say by far
the worst thing in this entire
collection they're way too waxy they're
not that pigmented they do not blend out
very well they don't dry down and they
are way way a way to overprice the next
several pencils are a much better
alternative the eyeshadow palettes
however were actually not that bad
specifically the face when I actually
really really like this one this
highlighter shade right here looked
absolutely stunning on the cheeks and
this metallic coral blush I am literally
in love with I want to reach for this
all the time this summer and the mermaid
palette as such as I was actually making
fun of it in the beginning was actually
a pretty bomb as well and I love how it
looks on the lower lash line the lip
palette although I was having a really
hard time finding a decent shade at
first I think I was actually able to mix
together a really beautiful nude and the
formula feels really really really nice
but I would definitely recommend buying
a lipstick instead because I know most
you guys don't want to sit there I was
saying good morning and mixed together a
lipstick I know I certainly don't the
mascaras were okay they definitely like
did their job of coating and lash and
giving them a little bit of a lift but
they're definitely not something I would
recommend or say that you needed in your
life and the brush collection is an
absolute no please never spend $40 on
four brushes ever I actually really
really do love the look that I came up
with today but it just took me way too
much time way too much ever and way too
much packing and Blandings we ought to
really get
good Ilyich going on I'm actually really
disappointed because you guys know I say
all the time or difficult for the are
and you guys might grew up drawing
painting and coloring and Pirela
actually did have a huge huge part in my
life and it got me through a lot of
really really tough times as a kid but
it really sucks to say that I will not
be recommending this election to you
guys and it will definitely not be a
part of my future makeup routine that
being said I really hope you guys
