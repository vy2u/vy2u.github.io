welcome back to my youtube channel as
you can see times over they have a very
special guest today when I got friends
in the entire world
Amanda Xing Wow here I mentioned I have
been friends for a very very long time
and we've been trying to fill for a very
very long time and saying you're finally
sitting down and doing so thank God if
you guys know no Amanda issues amazing
beauty guru on YouTube which is also my
closest friends we have been friends for
a very very long time like I said we've
been trying to film has never worked out
until today so we're finally coming to
you with this video she has been with me
through so much she's give me so much
advice and help me through a whole day
in the summer with a lot of boy stuff as
well as we're talking about later on of
the videos definitely stay tuned for a
lot of really deep and fun conversations
with stuff that we've encountered and
like stuff that we've learned from our
experiences dating and the beauty rows
and all that type of stuff I have a
confession
what this is only the second time
anyone's ever done my makeup what no oh
my god oh my god this is so exciting
so I put together this look on Amanda's
face today any kilobit we came up with
this cut crease chartreuse liner type
situation we really want to do something
out of my discomfort zone she does tend
to wear a lot of very very beautiful and
like glam natural sound makeup but I
really wanted to like push her and do
things that she would never normally do
both women and I had very very straight
Brown shapes and she said that cut
crease is nothing that she ever does so
of course that's really put on her face
today that's why when I wear this every
day now I like that look so so Bob if
you guys want to be have created this
super fun and easy look and hear all
about our lives and all the secrets and
also to get all the goth make sure
you're ready guys with it keep on
watching Amanda stay tuned the benefit
for emotional power mainly I use
hourglass mineral veil NYX angel ville
the professionals great my favorite
Amanda hustling deep most perfect skin
in the history in other way yes sister
so main foundation today we're using of
course my holy girl and apparently the
demand of moving if you brought it Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation check in
the shade why 2:45 I was hoping it would
be Y 315 that's why I did that
I go by the number - 120 I don't know
I have no idea what homer whining
Foundation or the beveling every time I
run so Miss Amanda you have a new man in
your life I do
so I started dating someone about seven
months ago actually we did our first
wait about seven months I was in a
relationship for such a long time that
you get so guarded it's so hard to let
someone back into your life and your
social media your followers like people
who watch our videos they're your family
so I don't just show them anybody right
though and I wanted like time to be with
myself and work on myself and then we
met just randomly like at a Halloween
party and I was like I wouldn't date him
that we're friends for a while and then
it just like haven't seen least expect
it yeah let's do you guys who don't know
if you follow me on Twitter it's not
tight you know that I get myself into
boy John walk quite often like in really
excited over like a straight guy I'm
going to get my heart hurt for no reason
when they had no chance in the first
place when I'm very very bad knock at
this but recently however I've been
getting myself involved a lot of like
guys who are kind of on the DL or more
like closet or not really controlled
their sexuality but at the same time
like still are talking to you which is
fine but at the same time it's like it's
a lot to deal with and it's something
that's very very far away just because
I'm so open and comfortable myself it's
totally okay but it's frustrating for me
the same time anything that I don't know
how to handle and and I have to sell
money like late night like two hour-long
FaceTime calls or she's just like what's
up Davis get your together but like
oh my god she's sound like my father
because it's really not your fault like
I mean you have to keep yourself guarded
right and it's hard because you want to
believe that someone's nice and they're
so nice at first and everything's great
like how could it go wrong and then
they're immature or it's I mean I can't
relate to the closet thing obviously
because I've been with that but I just
have one of my best friends and he deals
with that too and it just sucks because
it's like okay well then what are you
doing right I'm not going to even high
as like if you're with me or with me
like I want a normal relationship and
you reserved ahh but you deserve so much
better and like I've told you like it'll
weed out all the bad ones to try to
waste your time but when I first moved
to LA I didn't go on a date for a while
I think I only want a couple days and
they were not good
and it was just like I wish I could like
write a book or like do like certain
videos on all stuff that would happen I
feel such I don't know I how many times
that would get I know but I feel like a
lot of them still watch myself which is
super weird I don't get it's like they
don't want you but then they don't like
don't want you to move on
everything reach out for a reason though
when I look at all the relationship
workout like oh no I'm happy that it
didn't work out you've got something
that we have reached I'm I've like gone
into like a weird thing where I've like
called you like three ambien think I'm
gonna like kind of those times like my
life aside the world and I think a week
later on the Colemans I think it's like
a bubble to give rose-colored glasses on
or something because they seem so
amazing you said what kind of still I'm
going to get out you're like no on
poppin so culture maybe say to them you
can eat come on D shade on my palate my
Holy Grail and my morphe anaphora my
brush for the first time ever if you
want to get money off your order and
morphe brushes you can use called james
or coat amanda for 10% off so what's the
tea with the new boyz oh my god
well I just go back from playlist in
Orlando which you should have went to
buy a round
I'm car-stealing I'm yelling different
people right now that's the team but I'm
trying to keep these ones like imma do a
very very like just think that it
happened naturally if it's supposed to
happen and don't if it's not going to
happen here I really only in the past
maybe like overexcited and like getting
my hopes up really quickly has not
worked out at all
you're the prize you just keep it
something like on the bias see if this
is my go-to once you give them all the
control it's like they know it I don't
know what it is they love the chase and
then once they know do they have you
there like play games see because the
thing is I like the change like that's
me like I'm barely competitive like I
like a good challenge and stuff so like
that let's looking for me and then it
 me over every single time did you
feel like whenever you're talking
someone like they know you like them
like you're very open about it yeah I
usually I'm like verification you know
whoever has the power wins so you have
to keep the power I was like pouring
milk I was like being modest Rita still
my flirting is so like strange like I'll
be talking to some guy and he'll like
play some nice and be like I hate you so
much died or like that and my leg looks
like a locket I want you to make out
with me like worth anything in the
entire world
I don't know why you do it I I don't
know it's probably so ugly I don't even
know
we're going to amend us a fake for a few
minutes and while we do that we're going
to move right on to the eyebrows those
are a pair of bras right then your
joints are so people like thank you
might have been growing recently I want
my girl I want them thicker
really I love the grown to what we do so
much with them I feel like my heart is
so big - if I said to you we're going to
take a little bit of a cut crease liner
situation here on Amanda so we're gonna
be starting off with the morphe 35o
palette and once again code James or
code Amanda for 10% off oh it's like the
holy grail of Northey palette I'm gonna
start off by grabbing this liner brush
on the Marquise rolled gold collection
and dip into this warm of brown shade
right up in here so Amanda latest face
is very very similar to mine in the fact
that we both have a pretty straight brow
shape and not much like the way when you
actually open your eye so gonna have to
do a little bit of a low cut crease here
but that's totally okay and it will
definitely look regardless there just
won't be a lot of like space to blend
but we're going to make it work as
always
I'm going to grab this morphe 439 brush
and dip into this light orange shade
right here and I'm going to blend out
that light a little bit how do you do
your foot creases do you like to start
off by a bloody lot together than
deepening and then cutting a concealer
yeah usually I'll blend everything and
then I'll go in with like Paint Pot or
concealer and then carve out okay so the
item I talk faces in a really really
different way I will actually like start
off by drawing the bottom line and then
just blend upward which I've never seen
anybody else do it that way but I feel
like that gives me like a really really
clean that's smart for you I don't know
if you are someone if you're definite
like long do you want creases you should
try that let me know like how it works
yeah we'll brush first yeah that's
what's always worked for me I like that
technique like really well I reckon I
might more p.m. to 13 and dip into this
warm of dark brown shade in the bottom
and we used to deepen up the crease line
unnecessary with honest out the a for
brush limit more about safe tip
concealer just too hard out the crease
this is also why I like starting out
with that line rather than just like
putting color on them and cutting it
later because this kind of like gives
you guide of where to like cut the
concealer as well it's like the crease
is basically - there you see - Cleavon
up again do you always do your face
before I yeah do you do the other way
around I need to burn and now I'm kind
of switching a little bit to face first
if I there was a big did you see the
debate about this on Twitter today it
was like yeah anything for it was
everyone cook like popping off about it
I'm moved so mad as a guy that just
never thought do you think we all do
wake up in our own ways like it's okay
to have a different opinion people are
literally saying that some people like
let me Instagram because it this way or
am I had my girl I need to show it's
really like never an hour about there is
like when was makeup makeup Elise was
like out make a place another like not
arresting everybody on the girl so on
your products as long as you look boss
against that I actually no matter we
want to do a cool little liner pass on
Amanda's eyes and I wanted to a
chartreuse honest and this is inspired
by a by raquel and instagram shipping on
my all-time favorite or as we look she
did a chartreuse liner I don't have a
chartreuse anything actually so let me
get on a salvia lip color I'm going to
mix together the yellow tape a tiny
little dots of the blue to make my
chartreuse liner I'm going to use this
liquid a liner brush just to sketch in a
liner this is not as bright as we wanted
I'm kind of added like Norman neon
situation so we're going to try to set
it with a little bit of eyeshadow after
but we're just going to extension this
liner person see how it looks
we're just knowing about how I'm having
some bad latter days your so you know
better do some liquid liner on the meta
please Priory we're ready using the Mac
rapid block and ultimate eyeliner that's
a mouthful
that's right what you think that really
sums me you okay everything going back
on the 35 I'm gonna pick up my are 39
again I'm going to dip into the same
warm up brown shade and I'm just gonna
really lightly dusted on Amanda's under
eyes dropping I got a dark brown cheetah
Miami 213 I'm going to smoke out the
wing just the slightest bit planes out
from the outer corner so when I'm
blending this I am blowing right over
the bottom edge of the wing of blending
that black into would be brown and into
the orange to chronic rate and yet
smoked out effect on the d-pad out of
the way you want the top of the wing to
be obviously super defiant and cut
because it's a cut crease that we want
the bottoms really really smoky and not
defined next I'm just going to grab a
black single shadow for this one I'm
just using the one from Anasazi and my
custom palette and my more bm-21
too and I'm just going to darken up the
wing and the smoked out bottom wing I am
plugging this right up to the lash line
as well for lashes today is it really a
James Charles video if we don't use the
house lashes iconic I always do do what
I'm doing cut creases I feel like they
just frame the eye really really well
when it comes to coming just think I'd
like to out the outer part it's a lot
longer I don't know I feel like I got
our expiry to it they're different
lengths
it looks at so much dimension it really
does I mean I got it no those are my
favorite now I'm going to band a lot
more flexible to of course I never buy a
benefit roller lash mascara and pop this
onto the upper lashes now to mix the two
lashes together alright guys those are
both eyes all complete we're now going
to move on to a big low and for a glow
they're using the over highlighter in a
Rodeo Drive just like my all-time
favorite gold highlight authentically
gold will suit this book probably very
very well
I'm Esther Graham I'm working m31 brush
and that same highlighter to it snatch
Amanda's nose as our last and final
touch I'm going to go to the Kylee mat
with a lipstick in the shade Vampira and
set settings right one last time code
jam or code Amanda alright guys and I
