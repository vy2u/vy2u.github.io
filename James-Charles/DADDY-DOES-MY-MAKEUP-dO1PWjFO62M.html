father look when I do that there's a
little bit of color just a little as
family I wish my trouser-legs actors

rather than any shape this will fit you
did nothing about yeah this is a morphe
350 pellet good so so that's a very
dirty I leave all my pellets for easy
access you should wash them you're not
wrong and then they're the color okay go
ahead

the crew the first color is pretty good
so now I'm going to use this second
