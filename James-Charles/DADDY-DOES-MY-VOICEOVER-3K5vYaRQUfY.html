hi boys and girls welcome back to
James's YouTube channel alright so today
is going to show you how to do this
makeup look right here so if you're
interested keep on watching alright so
we're going to start off with this
product we're just going to rub it all
in the whole point is to get your face
nice and red alright then we're going to
use this Mac product so we're just going
to use this brush in order I guess focus
just on the nose so in this case for
James is big nose you're going to put a
lot try to cover it up make sure you
make it nice and small then we go in
this product we're going to cover the
rest of our freckled face with it
and we're just going to put it all over
I guess so we're just going to blend it
in with the brush make sure you get
every nice little freckle then you're
going to cover up that double chin go
nice and underneath the neck there gonna
use this product this product is to
cover up those bags so go ahead and have
fun with your going to create this
little bird sculpture a little nest
underneath little branches on the cheek
and then the cloud on top it looks like
it's raining now so rain drop drop top I
was this video stuff stop then we're
going to use this candle product um and
it looks like we're just going to put it
underneath eyes gonna do much never go
back and tickle our neck some more
alright next product James thank you
alright so we're going to use this dirty
pallet kind of put in our cheeks a
little bit our forehead and in your hair
a little bit doesn't look like it did
much but we're going to use it anyways
alright now we're going back into our
big nose we're going to blend it with
our big eyebrows so we're going to
connect the two you're going to do that
by putting a straight line down your
nose trying to make it look skinny but
we all know it's not skinny then we're
going to reinforce it with this dirty
sponge again make it nice and straight
lines good job James so it's good
encourage yourself alright now we're
going to use this baby powder on our
cheeks and our ear a little bit now
we're going to put underneath our eyes
kind of basically cover up all the work
we just did
and we're going to I guess we're going
to just let it sit there and now we're
going to go into the eyebrows again all
right so you're going to draw a nice
little straight line all the way across
underneath your eyebrows and we're going
to fill in those caterpillars continue
that straight line um you don't want to
forget those stragglers off to the side
so make sure you go back and get them
and kind of push them all over there you
go all right so James fucked up so he's
going back to those lines and he's gonna
make a nice and perfect and then this
next product so I guess we're going to
use this mascara for his eyebrows yeah I
guess that works
yep ones done not done and then now
we're done I wish it was that fast I'm
going to take him six hours to do makeup
now we're going to go into another dirty
pallet we're going to start with this
peach color and I put in our eyelids
pretty pointless doesn't look like you
did much now I'm going to use this
second color I'm going to try to blend
those two colors in together to make a
new color whole point of this is you
know to get that unique color so in this
case there's like 60 different colors
because I brushed it really dirty Oh 61
I guess this is the burgundy eye look
we're going for and then we're going to
use some of this glitter that he got
we're going to put it just in the corner
of the eye yep looks good James alright
now we're going to use this little
marker to make a nice little triangle
point on the corner of your eye make
sure it's nice and straight and I guess
now he's going ball a cross into the
glitter pretty pointless what's the
point of putting on the glitter just
going to cover it James all right now
he's going to finish this look off by
making his whole eye look purple and
they're going to use this new clean
brush finally to put the rest of the
glitter then we're going to put these
bad boys on these big old butterfly
lashes make sure they're all nice and
straight you don't want to be at a party
and dangling off that guy's going to say
bye to you
alright that side is done this side is
not thank you for pointing out Captain
Obvious alright now we're going to use
this product I think it's time for James
to do a singing note so glazed donut is
being finished by putting on your
forehead don't forget that nose you want
to make sure that nose look
nice and skinny even though it's not the
now we're going to go into the lips this
should be really quick since he doesn't
have much lips to work with yep we're
all done all right now we're going to
spray yourself with some water get it
nice and wet and we're all done all
right guys so thank you for watching
this makeup look give himself a thumbs
up and subscribe down low he's talking
way too quick I'm pretty sure he's
saying use his morphe code for 10% off
James he knows how to count to two and I
guess we are basically done James psyche

talking alright I guess I'm done bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
