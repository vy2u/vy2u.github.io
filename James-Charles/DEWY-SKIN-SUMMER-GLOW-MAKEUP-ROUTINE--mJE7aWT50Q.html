back to our YouTube channel so it is
officially June meaning summer time is
finally coming a product school ending
people are graduating you guys know that
I'm going back to New York in a viewer
short week to go visit my family and to
walk for graduation is going to be so
exciting but the best part of all of it
is that summer is finally here with all
that being said cutting right to the
point if you guys want to see how
created this skin focused dewy glowy
feathered brows struggle face summertime
and clam make sure you keep on watching
all right so let's go ahead and get
started with this dewy makeup look this
look is going to be a super duper easy
and very very quick as well so should be
a fun video sit tight relax grab your
pink drink and let's go sort of prime my
face today I'm actually gonna be using
two different primers the first one
being benefit Porefessional as always
and then the makeup forever step one
based hydrating primer since this is a
very very dewy look I do want to make
sure my face is super hydrated and very
very glowy however I still have a lot of
pores and acne spots especially in my
t-zone area so I do want to use the
professional just in that region to kind
of clear those pores and to smooth
everything else do I have a good at base
and the nose regions will just look too
crusty and gross so I'm just going to
look this product on or wearing up in
here and blend it out I'm making sure to
really massage into the pores as well to
get as smooth of a base as possible I
want all the makeup to go on very very
smoothly and evenly because we are going
to be really wearing a lot of makeup in
the first place we want to make a little
bit go a long way if that makes any
sense at all I'm just gonna grab a
little bit of the makeup primer primer
and I'm going to apply the rest to my
face using this I never used to use
hydrating primers until I moved to
California I used to have really really
oily skin but I noticed that once I
moved here my skin got very very dry so
now it's very important for me to
moisturize all the time I'm trying hard
to get in
getting care and helping a good routine
because as of right now I literally have
nothing besides wash my face in the
shower I've been very very blessed to
have like decent skin from doing that
but I don't want it to come back and
bite me in the ass later on it's really
important to use the hydrating primer to
make sure your faces moisturize hydrated
ready for the day it's going to protect
it from a lot of oils and a lot of that
bacterial stuff and it makes you look
dewy and glowy from within as well
obviously the goal for today's loved one
side primer is all on my next up is
going to be Foundation and for the first
time in a very very long time I am not
using my makeup for ever ultra HD
foundation stick today I'm using Too
Faced Born replace foundation in this
foundational I am in the shade natural
beige this one matches what I have a
spray tan right now is a little bit too
dark but that's okay you want to go for
that bronzer luck as long as we're not
going to too dark and once they have a
little bit of this on the back of my
hand I'm going to mix in these Tarte
rainforest of this see illuminating
radiance drop and to the foundation I'm
just going to do it like - okay this is
going everywhere I'm just going to do
like two little quick dots and I'm going
to blend up together just to add a
little bit more glow basically I just
want to keep my natural skin showing
through with just a little bit of
coverage just to even things out this is
actually the foundation that I was
wearing at Coachella this past year and
it did wonders for my skin I actually
left my foundation stick home that I
normally wear on a daily like makeup
basis so I had to borrow this one from
Laura this is my first time ever using
it so I was super horrified like trying
the foundation especially on a day like
Coachella where there's going to be
thousands and thousands of people there
I was so shocked to the freaking a core
with the foundation it wore so
beautifully all throughout the day it
was obviously super hot and I was very
very sweaty being in the middle of the
desert with a million people there but I
felt it so like as the day went on even
though my face was like melting and I
was sweating the foundations didn't like
move around I feel like everybody sweat
I just got dewier and do hear everything
really like stayed in place so I kinda
have like fallen in love with the
foundation so I feel like it's a very
very perfect one for the summertime like
I think we just want very very even
coverage for saying this go where all
day long and say very very radiant for
concealers today I'm going to use of
course my shape tape concealer and I'm
going to use the shade light and medium
honey but I'm barely going to use any of
this at all
I'm going to put like one or two dollops
right under the eye just to conceal my
dark circles
in our corner here because I always have
a little bit of gray and I'm just going
to really lightly cover up some
blemishes I find that the little bit of
safety of literally goes the longest way
as you can see I'm going to put on like
$3.00 underneath the eye just a tiny
little bit and it just covered up my
dark circles so so well
we really sort of do even skin we don't
want to look like we're actually even
like wearing a lot of makeup at all
we just want natural dewy beautiful skin
so I'm using the little bit of products
that are going to work really really
well together and I'm not going to take
it on next if I went acing in a grand
way Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder but I'm actually only going to
set underneath my eyes I'm just gonna
grab the slightest bit of translucent
powder I'm just packet right underneath
there just to set that concealer in
place and I'm also going to pick a
little bit of it onto my nose just to go
up my nose region always gets SuperDuper
oily no matter what foundation what
whether I'm and so I just want to make
sure it's a blossom place out of
everything but for the rest of my face
I'm really going to leave it super dewy
and unset which might be horrifying some
of you guys so definitely feel free to
pack anything on if you want to but I've
actually been loving the look of like
kind of leaving the foundation there
throughout the day which is horrifying
I know I've never ever in a million
years thought I'd be saying that but I'm
honestly been loving for the no
foundation setting looks lately just
like under the eyes and on the nose to
make sure everything is locked in place
because those are the two areas that are
going to leave us fastest but under than
that that's it I guess for the powder
whoo for this like I'm actually going to
skip out on contour completely so that's
going to be a note Kat Von D shade and
light palette I know this is so weird
all the classic James Charles products
are currently out the window but I am
going to go into my benefit hoola
bronzer and my Sigma s can powder brush
and I'm just going to lightly bronze my
face since this look is for summer we
just are going to want to run our faces
up and that's what I love hoola bronzer
for this is my favorite bronzer than it
works for many different skin tones
which is great I personally cannot bend
this under very long because I will
return into a tomato and that is never
any fun that's what I get for being
Shane mayonnaise but you know what we're
just going to fake it till we make it
with using bronzer all over our face I'm
not going to use too much or else it
might get a little cocky
because we didn't set the foundation but
these are the pros and cons that we get
with these type of things because then
we get this like doing beautiful looking
skin so I'm just really really lightly
and going on the entire face of this on
the forehead on the cheekbones and then
in the jawline as well and then since we
didn't actually set the base we can
always go back into the end of the
beauty blender and just blend over any
areas that are like a little bit
undefined or looking a little bit
unblended I'm just going to go right
under this contour here to kind of read
to find out just using the leftover
foundation not just going to clean up
and make it look nice and snatched I'm
going to jump around just a little bit
and my next step is going to be to do
with some grass I'm going to grab my
Anasazi at Beverly Hills
Broadway's in the shade medium brown and
I'm just going to a super lightly fill
them and I'm just gonna turn up the
spoolie on the end and I'm going to
brush all the hairs upward for let's
look I'm not going to go for the very
like snatched Instagram brow I just want
to do it super light feathery brow and
I'm just going to give them a tiny bit
more shade basically just on the tail
and just to make it look defined but not
like cut out an on-suite you know like I
don't feel what I'm feeling is done I'm
barely even touching the pencil to my
face I'm just making the slightest
little lines just add the tiniest bit of
color there just for some more
definition but I don't want it to be
like actually like filling them and
obviously this depends on however your
browser shapes and where your sparse
areas are but for me out of this corner
right here this is my only really like
sparse area that I wish I had some more
hair so this is going to be the one area
that I am going to push the pencil down
just a little bit harder to kind of take
it try and make it but once that is
defined and in there I'm just going to
brush the hairs up using my spoolie and
then I'm just going to set them in place
because that I was basically done that
is when we're all completely honestly
love how that turned out
I do not even use any concealer or
foundation underneath it to clean it up
I was just SuperDuper laying precise and
this is what we came up with now since
we are going for the feathered brow type
of luxe we definitely want to make sure
these pairs are set in place and they're
not going to like fly away and really
want them to stick up to give us that
kind of like light and fluffy look to do
that as I'm using the benefit roller
lash mascara but in the shade Brown you
guys know that the normal black version
of this mascaras are my all-time
favorites are my regular lashes but I
figured why not use the brown one for my
brows today obviously this is a mascara
but you can use it on whatever you want
the play is that it keeps
or hairs in place and very very
voluminous so I figured this would be
the perfect product use on my brows to
really stick those hairs up and lock
them in a place I'm just going to super
lightly comb through the hair I don't
want to get too much product on there
just basically enough to get those hairs
where I want them to be and not as
offensive are all complete I like this
so much I'm going to go into the other
one off camera quickly and I'll be right
back to finish off the rest of the face
now that the brows are all done we're
going to move on with the eyes and
forces look are we doing no eye shadow
whatsoever
all I did was use a little bit of the
Laura Mercier trim does the powder just
to set my eyelids in place make sure
there's nothing was like crease they are
getting ugly and oily throughout the day
but I definitely do want to go in with
just a little bit of mascara so I'm
going to start off by a curling my
lashes I sort of got at least have the
nicest lashes before I want falsies all
the time and now they're all gone I
don't have any left it's a very very sad
sad truth and then for the last is once
again I'm going to go to that brown or
the last mascara I don't really want to
do it black just because they feel like
it's a little bit too invasive for this
look obviously you can do whatever the
hell you want your face and not mine but
for me I just want to make my lashes
look nice and plump but not too defined
when I'm doing this I'm just applying
the tiniest little bit just to get the
lashes evenly coated and to make them
stick up and look defined but like I
said we are not going for that super
spider a Columbia last today we just
want to make them look like they're
there and not hundred percent ripped off
by our last label I'm also applying a
very very light coat to my bottom lashes
as well being super careful to not get
it on my skin and my eyelid because we
don't really have a lot of product there
to begin with so any mistakes are going
to be very very hard to get rid of
without taking off all the products so
just be careful go slow be patient
that's a word that really is I'm level
tabular laughter alright and as the eyes
all done like I said this book is super
duper easy so let's go ahead and move on
and our next step is going to be blush
and a little bit of a surprise to some
fake freckles I'm going to grab my
morphe I'm a 509 brush remember you can
use tone J's or 10% off all morphe
product and my max blush in the shade at
peaches this is my all-time favorite
blush I really don't use a lot of blush
on my channel or in my look but I really
do like this one I feel like it's just a
very very natural color for my specific
skin tone I know for later shades
reality's a more
my pinky tone and then for darker shades
my twenties the more magenta tone but
for me this tone works very very well
I'm just thinking I'm going to grab a
little bit of that on my brush make sure
to top the excess off because we don't
want a lot by any means and then we're
just going to add a super light wash of
color alongside about bronzer next turn
off the fake freckles we're bringing it
back everybody it has been a very very
long time since I'd use it in a look but
it is summertime we're going to get the
glow on we're going to get the fake
breakfast ready we're going to look so
snatched you guys know that I was
rocking Spaak sparkles for so long for
my all-time favorite things to add to
any cute little makeup look I just like
they add so much youth and just
beautiful mint to any look what am I
saying anyways
oh very my more feet per 36 brush and
they're dipped back into the blush and I
was going to apply a little bit of this
on the bridge of my nose
this step is obviously totally optional
but we want these freckles to look real
as possible and natural freckles form in
the high points of your face where the
Sun hits the most and when the Sun is
hitting a place on your face that's
where you also get sunburned and a
little bit of redness as well so
applying the blush here just makes it
look a lot more natural it makes it look
like the freckles are actually coming
out from underneath your skin to turn my
freckles today I'm gonna grab my makeup
forever brow pencil this one is in the
shade of 30 I think this one because it
is a little bit of a medium brown but it
does have a little bit of a red
undertone that's going to be why does I
think you'd be able to see that if this
is a little bit of a red undertone so
it'll be the perfect shade for fake
freckles I'm just going to start off by
buying a bunch of tiny little dots on my
nose bridge and I'm going to keep them
centered right here in the middle of the
nose and then just spread them out too
sly to fit right up in this region and
as it gets closer to the cheekbone I'm
going to kind of fade them out and make
them more and more sparse there is no
right or wrong way to apply fake
freckles but the one rule that you want
to follow is not all Carlos are created
equal farkles form naturally on your
skin from the Sun and you definitely
make sure you're using a different
pressure and different sizes when you're
creating the freckles because if you
have like six dots just across your face
that are all the exact same shape and
size it's going to look really really
fake if you want to add a preface to a
look this one might literally all same
favorite things to do if you're not
really confident in it just Google a
picture of somebody with freckles and
then just look at that when you're
drawing them on just to kind of base off
that and see where the freckles should
go how they're shaped where they're most
concentrated the color of them etc
etc if you have any pimples or spots to
the you I'm covered
just take your brow pencil and lightly
go over and turn it into a big freckle
as well
once those freckles are all placed on
that I'm going to go back to my Beauty
Blender on the button and I'm just going
to really lightly tap over them just to
make them kind of melt in the face and
not look too pigmented basically
whatever foundation is left on this is
going to tap layer over the freckle and
I'm just going to create one extra super
super thin layer on top of them which
will make them look more real and kind
of right underneath the skin just having
normal freckles would look obviously the
biggest part to do a skin is going to be
the glow to start a hospitai I'm going
to grow in my benefit what's up
highlighting sick in my damp mini Beauty
Blender I really do not use cream
highlighters that often but because we
didn't fully set this foundation it is a
little bit still wet so I don't want to
go to the full-on powder highlighter
because it might get a little bit clumpy
and stick to some of those wet areas
using a cream will really enforce that
we get a natural glow from Lantana first
then we can lay overtop would do little
bit of powder just to really enhance it
so that way it won't look too patchy and
grow I'm just going to tap this button
to item to the tip of the products and
then just go right onto my skin I'm
focusing this product right on at the
tops of the cheekbones and then I'm just
gonna bring this up into a little bit of
a c-shape right up to the top of the
brow bone area where the natural
highlights would form on the top of the
brow bone and then just connect this
right back down same thing is the other
side of focusing in on the top of my
cheekbone and then I'm just going to
bring it right up to the eyebrow bone up
here on the forehead just to get that
natural glow then bring it right back
down in these c-shape going on in the
top of the brow bone and then right back
down to the cheekbone I'm not sure how
this glowy showing up on camera but oh
you can't see okay good good good good
good
oh this is like the most beautiful
natural like subtle glowing from within
a type of highlight I am gonna layer
over top of this with powder and just a
quick second like I was saying but going
into this cream of base first to surely
make it look like natural dislike you
moisturize to hell and that but in like
the best possible way
I'm going to grab the appointed under
the Beauty Blender as well and I was
going to top a little bit on there and
I'm going to use this for the bridge of
my nose I'm also going to pop the little
bit of this right onto the Cupid's bow
alright you can honestly totally stop
here with this glove it looks so
beautiful it just like
as very very natural and radiant but
y'all know me we need to be blinding
people laughing right especially in that
Summer Sun so I'm just going to go a
little bit one step further and I'm
going to use the auto policy illuminator
in shades so Hollywood if I mark the
m5a1 brush and just adds a little bit of
extra glow oh yes well yes that is
exactly what the doctor ordered oh yeah
for the dilatation I'm going to grab a
pencil brush and the same as a
highlighter we did not do any notes
contouring at all so Lord noses are
laughs and final chance to make it look
even somewhat not all right and that
that's the makeup all complete like I
said I told you guys it'd be super duper
easy to finish this off I'm going to set
my face using some mac's fix+
I really want the tiniest bit of powder
that we did use to really melt and just
make everything is super super dewy and
glowy
and then as a final step I'm gonna use
my Urban Decay oil be slick setting
spray six make sure it is lost in place
because it is cream it definitely will
slip around if we don't walk in place so
we're all set alright guys that is the
dewy makeup look all complete I know you
threw this in every single video but I
really really love how this turned out
not to toot my own horn or anything but
