picture of James with no shirt on these
look like the spookiest ever
kaleem's parents just south of us oh my
god the picture of my mother

because like I before like I wasn't
aware I was like a huge fan of all like
every yeah anyways so I'm not specially
to solve anything fine whatever made you
a drawing oh oh my gosh yeah you did
give me this yeah I did lots of them all
I just went ahead of dude co-leads I was
really quickly off camera and now we're
gonna make her face are you like okay

has to be there somewhere about 13
hashtag Murph and of her life I love you
Miranda you're so beautiful and perfect
you're my idol
so haters back off what you want me to
impersonate and you said Chaplin hell
killing the game the best cover about
this palette talk about it way too much
about it's a pretty good Miranda sings
is selling tickets and my mama take me
oh my god who wants to go text me ASAP
yeah I can't find a picture of the two
of us together though well it has to be
there somewhere
now that I think about I remember me and
my best friend at the time complaining
that Rachel took the photo mm and he
declared anybody people are I may be not
posted
for the live I'm gonna grab the Stila
liquid metal thinking's these things are
sort of everybody what they're actually
called but this is the shade of Kenton
karma have used in support no okay so
you need to look down okay and not look
up and then goes mad yeah okay that'll
be great
what these go on like a liquid but then
they dry it out and click on that
medicine they don't move either in the
prettiest cover I've never even heard of
them they're so good I says I will say
this like I get my makeup done every
once in LA for like events and stuff
makeup artists always complain about
like beauty gurus online and how they're
all fake and they don't know what
they're doing and like they're taking
their jobs and they're so they're so bad
about it
but let me just tell you I have never
liked how any of them who don't know
like I always prefer like when I do
collabs with YouTube friends and like
they do my makeup I'm like it always
looks so much better because you know I
think I think that like when you learn
how like be a makeup artist basically
kind of care for a client as a makeup
artist as a lot different than like
actually doing makeup but I think that
that knowledge is something that a lot
of the YouTube people including myself
don't have like I would never sit there
yeah I'm a professional makeup artist
because I'm not you can't sit there to a
client properly like sanitize all my
brushes to prevent diseases and
something I've seen all the same
all my friends and yeah we've been good
but what I don't like is I feel like a
lot of those people feel like because
they've been working at a lot longer
because they work at like a supporter
back that there for some reason better
or more talented we just so far from the
case because the amount of times I've
seen an awful awful awful work come out
of those different sources ridiculous
and great work to you
yes sir absolutely absolutely but I
think amount of time or experience
you've been doing something does not
equate to tell it whatsoever
yeah but it's never easy that's so many
people will sit on my knee but beauty
gurus have no time on the girl I can be
the face way better than you can beat
well just because you've been working it
back for time yeah it's not that that's
the tape this is what I have cut creases
if you look down oh my god it's so hard
to look up without like creasing my face
how do you guys do it a lot of practice
like I have my mirror here at all step
and then I do my makeup completely with
my we are here like looking down the
entire time because they see how right
here I feel like your mother I feel like
this is the do my mom's makeup because
at this moment we I did bring a touch of
her lashes I have some modulus tears
publish anyone's done which ones do you
have I have my card l-like just generic
like ones his face more to fun you
can see what they look like my eyelashes
no move on to highlight are only wait
for sister away from my bottom lashes
I'm going to use of course when it
really be a Duke Charles video if I was
not using the auto sales yet so
Hollywood illuminator and combination of
my work I never gonna quit it I feel
like whenever I try to like bronze my
face or like blush sure how that or
anything at all just morph together yeah
these are gonna be about red carpet
assist she wears like to be a bang
long shadows I'm tired you want to get
those online these look like a winged
these up like a wing I don't know
so why do we get wet basically when you
like wet your brush would like fix
applause early let's say that's bit of
water before you apply it for like
metallic and signed shades it makes it
like more pigmented and more like
blinding yes we must care I don't have a
lobster wash color in there
yeah how dirty of spooky
I'll so get ready for old age because my
lashes used to be so long and now
they're like stubby little stubs it's a
clone fake ones for a reason so for a
Colleen's look today I'm going to use
the over liquid lipstick in the shade
honey Lulu and you guys know you can use
code James 30% of your purchase well
she's dying she is and I'm gonna finish
off Colleen's look with some exposed I
forgot my settings right yeah my hair is
