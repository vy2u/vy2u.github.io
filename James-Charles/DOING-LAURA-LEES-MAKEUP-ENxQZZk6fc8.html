back to my youtube channel today i'm
joined with a super super special gust
miss love
so for today's video lauralee just did a
my makeup over on her channel and i'm
gonna now do her makeup that's a beauty
guru as we always get to be in our own
faces every single day videos all the
time for different events but it's
really really rare that we actually get
to get our face beat other people let
alone other beauty gurus exactly yeah
intimidating a way more intimidating
because I don't know I think they'll
like you do the full beat glam like you
know the full we clams yeah like oh my
gosh okay
oh wow I do too we did however at the
end of the look give a brutal on it yeah
beat down out the last words out things
that James wasn't obsessed with but
you'll have to wait I have to check out
yeah so she's gonna do the same thing we
should go tell me well the tears if she
hates it actually loves it how she feels
so without further ado I'm gonna be
auras face now make sure you stay tuned
at the end of the video for her brutal
breakdown of the makeup and then I also
check out our video on Laura's tail or
she beats my face in this beautiful glam
without further ado let's get started
so those are my preparing Laura's face
using the benefit Porefessional primer
you guys know that I love this primer
and also it is one of Florence favorites
too so we're using the hourglass
foundation stick in the shade beige face
that she already knew she did do you
prefer liquid foundations or stick
funders usually um this is I'm a go to
but lately I've been using the alarmist
Mercier a flawless fusion for a liquid
or I love like the Milani
the drug cause we weren't perfect yes
honey I don't try that one
it's so good really yeah it feels like a
high-end foundation so I call it
concealer say it concealer concealer
yeah people say is they wrong I don't
hear it come see what her concealer yeah
I don't think you're saying it wrong I
don't think they're wrong either
I think what does any way either longer
voices or hate our voices
yeah there's no in-between oh we have in
common I hope you do we have
boys thing Oh people hate my voice oh my
god that makes me love you so much more
people say that I sound like I have
something stuck in my throat when I'm
talking people say I sound like I'm
constantly sick which is I mean I guess
kind of true but minor minor truths to
people sound like it says like I'm
whining or that like I have like an old
lady's voice it's like a lot of people
hate my voice because I talk too fast
which we a lot of people comment saying
that I give them anxiety because I talk
so fast which is really scary because I
really do try to not but I can't help
that so if you're one of those people I
apologize there's actually a little
speed button where if you click the gear
on your video you can change the speed
to 75 per size it was 200 and then I'll
be a lot more slowed down so if you were
someone who wants to hear me talk a
little slower anybody for that matter
chocolate mousse a little or faster
that's a really good hack for you guys
okay I'm gonna contour Laura's face
using my benefit hoola bronzer before
favourites anything I'm worth II am five
seventy brush do you feel like have a
small head you do have a small can you
see it now you do it's like super small
I tell people so once the bronze is all
on one check that I absolutely love
doing when it comes to a contract and
bronzing is taking a like smaller fluffy
brush like this one but I let's go into
the more cool toned bronzer so this one
is the Marc Jacobs bronzer and tantastic
which is definite little bit more cool
tone then benefit hoola and I so grabbed
this on a more of tapered brush and just
go in it right on that contour line it
to get a more like defined contour right
in the hollow of the cheek bone I've
never done this before this is like one
my favorite tricks that I just started
doing I feel like it just adds a lot
more dimension and really like gives you
the snatched I think everything how
about someone does my makeup or I watch
someone do makeup or like I just went to
make it by Mario's seminar hmm I think I
learned a lot of things that like
everything you just never stop learning
no I feel like I pick up different
tricks from each artists everybody does
the make it different always cool to see
how other people do their makeup cuz you
guys be inspired and pick up different
techniques and learn to the things I
think it better better better mm-hmm I'm
next to the guy by JD weighty 180 brush
this is my all-time favorite nose
contouring brush from a lot see beauty
on the benefit hoola bronzer and also
dipping in time into the Marc Jacobs
fantastic and we're gonna check out
Laura's nose I love when I go up you can
see a snatch nose
so I'm like oh yeah yeah
bitch she's doing that nose then it's
gonna grab a powderpuff
and uses to bake the sides of sister
Laura's knows what do you feel like
you'd be doing if you weren't on social
media you didn't take the social media
path I'd only have no idea and I think I
left that honestly I think you would be
in college somewhere I think I would too
which scares me because I think college
definitely was not for me and I think I
don't think college is for everybody
yeah I think education is really
important but I don't think the college
particulars for everybody I think I
would be really struggling to figure out
what I wanted to do with my life I think
that's a lot of people and hear me out
when I how I how much I agree with you
on that because I almost didn't graduate
high school but because Society said you
know you got to go to college to make
money or be smarter to do anything gray
so it's able to get into a college and
it took me three years into college and
I had filled out I was 24 years old and
I had felt out and I was left with a a
slit of debt for forcing something that
society put on me to make me feel like I
was smart so as a medical assistant at
the time as well working at
dermatologists which I made decent money
I just really didn't like the job so I
got pushed into YouTube and I felt so
madly in love with it and then me and
YouTube kind of grew together and I
created this amazing career and it's all
because I fell out of college you know
yeah I don't think it's everybody I
think that everybody has a different
path and education definitely is not
part of everybody's I agree with you I
don't know where I would be if it wasn't
for you too you know I started this
channel just simply as a makeup lover
and all of a sudden supposed to be a
professional businesswoman and you know
the role model for millions people and a
professional makeup artist and do
everything perfect and and it's just
like so much pressure gets thrown on you
you know you're and then you start
you're like whoa this is a lot yeah so
while Laura's baking in the oven at 350
degrees I'm gonna get my benefit precise
hair brow pencil in the shade at number
four I'm gonna slay her brows and that's
right I'm never gonna make it
Laura's brows go more out then down
towards the tail we were just hung up
this how I've really been doing my brows
more I'll then down because I feel like
it gives a lot more eyelid it sways abot
their knees and I'm literally the mom
off Mean Girls I'm like what school
what's the four one one
hmm and she told me that this year all
her friends are assessed with this guy
named James Charles and I'm serious I
know I was like interesting I was like
James II she was like yeah oh no way
you know I know him she's like it was
actually - yeah I swear let's go in and
we're gonna grab some more shaped Haven
I want to use that to Prime at Laura's
Island dance I'm just gonna use a Y 16
brush to blend out that concealer and
make sure the eyes are all primed and
set in place and ready for the shadow
okay so now that the brows are both
slated in place we're gonna start off
with the eye shadow first I'm gonna be
Laura Lee Los Angeles Cosmo dreams
actually you blew me away use the and
one ear on your lips I was gagged a
little a little chocolate moment I was
like damn I had to watch this video to
the end I want to see and then you put
on like a liquid lip oh but that's not
it what did you do and then you put that
on I was gay you guys haven't checked
out that video yet make sure to click
somewhere up here you know pop it'll pop
up but yeah the palette is so bottom
people were so mad tonight oh my god
he's eating her ass no girl it's a good
color
it's about it so our first notion of
using Miami 519 brush I'm gonna dip into
a bomb diggity and start putting this
into Laura's crease as a transition
shade this is honestly like my favorite
transition shades of all time thank you
I love it - it's just such a good like
mustardy yellowy browns are my favorite
I'm currently using the shade of Craig
Craig on an M 210 brush and I'm using
this to pull out that outer corner
shadow and then also define a decrease a
little bit more unless to grab the
Jasmine help from morphe one of both of
our all-time feels clearly clearly she's
all dirty
she's been used and loved and I see we
have another M 210 brush it's just a
clean one and dip into this red tone
brown shade down here then definitely
tap off the follow as well it's gonna
pop this right in Laura's outer V for
some definition I'm gonna be making sure
that when I take these shadows I'm
pulling them out and winging them as
well that's like one of my all-time
three things to do my makeup you guys
know that I love a go-to pulled out
shadow moment it's like my favorite
thing in the world and I definitely
widened my face when I were literally
just talking about earlier how she like
wishes she could do that and I was like
you can you can do it you just gonna do
it I'm gonna grab Laurie a scatterbrain
Eliot I'm up for two one brush and I'm
going to spread it a little bit using
some of fix+
I put folks Plus on all my shimmers no
matter what shimmer it is yeah I can't
oh my god I literally hate when people
are using a palette and they're like you
have to use da yeah I mean that's why I
shadow know why would you not and even
if it performs like a gym dry I'm still
fixed bus it again Sam it helps with
fallout to like it helps snatch it all
together and if you don't like when a
purchase fix+
even a little bit of water spray bottle
it don't ya it doesn't have to be fixed
less once I have that legit oh I'm gonna
go back into my r39 brush and dip into
the shade a cray cray and just use this
to blend over the edge of that glitter
pigment and then also the darker shades
in the outer corner to make sure that
that is a smooth even transition for the
half cut crease so if you only got to
use one makeup product for the rest of
your life no I'm gonna be three three
products so generous
yes and I'm trying to be generous here
three products desert island you know
yeah that too mm-hmm what's it gonna be
I feel like a concealer okay a brow
pencil
okay and the highlighter love it what
would you do I would do oh do concealer
because I'll put a concealer on with no
other makeup so if you like like what
could be one alone you know concealer
mascara and probably huggin blotting
powder no why yeah for the lower lash
line in the Jacqueline palette I'm going
to cry
the Sigma eat 20 bucks which is a flat
shader brush and I'm gonna grab the
bright ass teal shade oh we get some
color help is on a Laura's lower
lashline I'm excited about this so good
are you kidding
oh come on fire I'm gonna have an amat
to ten brush and dip it to a little bit
of bomb diggity which is that amazing
transition shade and just buff out the
bottom line about to make sure the blue
isn't too like harsh then I'm gonna dip
back into that blue and then I'm gonna
just add a lot of fix+ to really get a
pigmented huh
well she does a good tunt pop have a
weak one but I do it literally all the
time still it's a puffer cones yeah baby
she's a weak one
the actual better go the darker blue
shade and the purple shade from the
chocolate palette once again it got me a
little bit of fix+ and I'm gonna put
that in the outer corner mixing it
together the bright blue and then also
kind of mending it into those darker
purple red shades that are on the upper
lash line to kind of connect those
together and then one more time of
grabbing my 210 rush I'm just gonna dip
into a warm tone orange shade and just
blend out the bottom at one last time or
what is your favorite makeup look that
you've ever done on yourself I think I
recently did one with my eyeshadow
palette because as you know like I have
been doing tutorials as much um I've
been reviewing new makeup that's been
launching but one of my favorites for
sure is look I actually do have a
palette and I actually spent a long long
time doing it I did like a Mac cut
crease but like shimmer in the middle of
the cut crease it was really intricate
what about you um I know you got some
looks I have sort of definitely some
good luck yes I think that my favorite
whatever was probably my Eclipse look
from oh yeah like like the food mm-hmm I
just added that hey man I have my liquid
liner and didn't really use that as a
liner I just kind of more fill to end
and then use it to define that crease it
was good girl that's you watching
sometimes you just get blessed I should
be watching a movie cuz I'm gonna have
Laura lolly apply her own at mascara
that's just our rules and
Jules in the artistry if you're working
with someone who can do their own
mascara they're doing their own mascara
well Laura is applying the mascara she's
using benefit roller lash of course I am
grabbing the Lily lashes my Emily's
these are my all-time favorite lashes oh
my god so Lourdes is introduced me to
this new lash glue from the Loire called
the lash adhesive and it's the best ever
and I'm so hated to not try this for
myself
good it dries out so quickly and like
sticks which never happens because you
guys know every time I put on an eyelash
I was sitting there fumbling with the
freaking inner corner for like 20 that's
everybody there she is
yep that's good ever been out and about
and then your inner corner just pops up
yeah oh yeah that's why I carry law
school at all times I mean that me -
well I like when I go to events and
stuff if I'm wearing makeup I always
have law school and a pair of tweezers
and a Beauty Blender and blotting powder
and straws that's genius
alright I'm adding straws to my list
that's that's a good one okay so another
one is all complete we're gonna go in
and do them on an off camera right now
and then I'll be right back to finish
all the rest of the law okay guys so
both eyes aren't well what did you see
that what I'm scared was this shadow oh
my god
weird to focus yeah we're gonna use the
why 14 today look do you have most of
the morphe brushes memorized yeah we do
every time they're always like how do
you know that I'm like I don't know I
just use them all the time and of course
wouldn't be a James Charles City without
anasazi it's so Hollywood illuminator
hashtag not sponsored oh are you kidding
I'm also there go a little bit of
scatterbrain on that same brush and I'm
going to use that to kind of like really
lightly blend together the bronzer and
the highlighter I like doing this a lot
actually using like a more metallic
shade rather than highlighter to blend
together just for like a more subtle
glow also using this shade to highlight
Laura's do we do hello your forehead
over oh yeah oh yeah you literally just
it on me yeah it's like everything in
the world some people don't like it so
I'm always gonna tell them you know I do
but yeah
it's my favorite so now that the makeup
is all on our last time it's gonna be at
the lipid a doodahs and for today's look
I'm gonna be using the Anasazi liquid
lipstick in the shade and naked another
good naked lamp and then last but
certainly not least I'm gonna give her a
little spritz of the tatcha luminous
dewy skin mess maybe a little bit more
than a little spread and guys this is
the completed look
yes it looks so good I'm actually really
really happy on it yeah thank you I love
it so much I love love love the eyes I
can't quit looking at the viewfinder
sorry guys that's okay oh my god I'm
cute in the same thing I'm looking at
you okay
