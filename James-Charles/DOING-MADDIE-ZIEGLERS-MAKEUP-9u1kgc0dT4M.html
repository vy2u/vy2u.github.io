I feel like every time I do over the
carpet it's very natural which I love so
much that's my favorite look to do but
since I'm here it's only appropriate to
do a full coverage glam very like James
Charles so yeah we decided to do this
double Caprice on sister Maddie and
something that she has never done before

a double dose ad yeah this is a crazy
moment she doesn't even remember so this
is so much fun to like break her out of
her bronzy a beautiful graham shell
