by storm then he did my bloom you've
seen him like that story you haven't
seen him in my bed yet
no it's right daddy's bath hi sisters
James Charlton and welcome back to my
youtube channel so it's really very very
long time since I've had 90 Victor on my
youtube channel as you heard in the very
very cheesy intro that we decided to do
he did my voiceover ended in my gland
but I didn't want to blame on Victor for
so long he's been declining forever but
we finally came to a good deal which
cannot be discussed on camera
before we really get into this video I
want to say a major thank you to when i
vest i was an entire world victor full
of you guys who don't know a victor is
not actually my father he was my best
friend in the entire world husband but i
call him daddy because he's extremely
hot and i fell in love with him is good
but we were just my friends to clarify
because we still get questions all the
time even though we've just closed in
every single video so Victor is not my
father
they just my daddy thank you at the end
the day I definitely take a lot of balls
for you straight guys that you put on a
full face exam so major respect to
Victor the end of the day is just makeup
so I'm actually here to see you to
support you that's all that matters wow
you just wipe it off a true man well all
that being said this is definitely gonna
be a very very long video so I want to
keep you guys for too much longer if you
wanna make a changes from Z he'll silky
and picture hemorrhoid makeup for the
first time we should want everything on
the decide make sure you really put up
keep on watching a person I started by
priming and daddy's face using our
benefit Porefessional primer which are
how does it feel to have makeup on
little t who don't know I've been trying
to get Victor to the city with me for a
very very long time now such has been
saying now how do you feel to be finally
putting makeup on and such a session no
comment for daddy foundation today I'm
gonna use makeup forever not Ultra HD
foundation check the liquid formula in
the shade of wire for 25k over here and
stop there we go come on Victor
Orson had no hair hook stop it's going
to take us three hours oh you're sweaty
wait your notice broken but if I push on
that doesn't hurt though right no I just
can't breathe
great this edition is looking a little
bit dark right now I'm going to blend it
down Victor's neck and naturally well
before head in the studio lights but I'm
probably just lighting a little bit of a
different story but I don't really have
a lot of foundation shades that match
darker skin tones because y'all know
that I am extremely pale like Casper the
Friendly Ghost up in here so I'm trying
my best I will even about the concealer
your problem for computer generated
using the tarp tape tape concealer in
the shade of light medium honey
convictions my honey the most of my
talking are vegas-y squinting that one
says cold turn the fire keep what does
it have to be close your eyes and your
makeup it clearly okay how would I do
anything I want to close my room okay
check it out look up Minna no chin down
over your eyes
how the do you look up with your
chin down actually like this I just my
eyes yeah this question for every room
girl from 1 to 10 how's Jane one
wow thank you
oh no targets taken by worth my me bitch
call me a bitch for sorry Danielle okay
alright I'll be honest right now
 I really don't hate him I just mess
with him that's what did it it's our
friendship
true long as it's not a love friendship
oh right um I'm contouring Victor's face
using my morphe m-52 three brush and my
Catlin DJ my palette as always I'm just
going to choose my eyes cheekbones
Victor has really really good cheekbones
and I'm already mad because I know his
cult or Holly and blush region is going
to look really really good
so I'm going to contour Victor's a
bigger forehead using the same brush
that's the only big thing you contour
oh I'm going to contour Victor's dosage
my JT wavy twenty two brush and my
shaded light palette once again
Victor's nose is currently broken and
it's been broken for several years now
and it's still not fixed so we're gonna
try to fix that today yeah it kind of
broke it a while ago playing basketball
I never really fully broke so they
couldn't push it back so it's basically
like was it a fracture yeah the do
I look like a doctor to your favorite
shows for me currently I watched the
Bates Motel I started watching it and I
like stopped through it I got born well
I know there's like the history behind
yeah well I took like a history
motion-picture class in high school and
we had a washing bunch of like my movies
and one of the movies was called psycho
and it was basically that same setting
in that in that show like the same hotel
the same house in the back my current
favorite sorta launch is probably
present break and do you guys have like
do they really that was in the question
oh come on
okay that if it's not present maker if
everyone watching will be RuPaul's Drag
Race I'm associated to see this season
unveiling it's so good and I definitely
have so many favorites that I want to
win teams Chang and team Sasha here we
go
I'm literally lately of baking Victor
space to bring up some of those
highlights like I said before the
foundation is definitely a little bit
dark so I'm going to try to even
everything out and make him not look
dark I'm also going to bake underneath
the victors beard to get a more a
defined line like I said I've never done
makeup on a beer before so I'm pregnant
this works I see man I do it shadow
sister man Eve if this doesn't work it's
on you although Roger knows so it's
bright what you can't see is that I'm
actually chained to this change hole my
thighs are tied behind my back so I'm
going to slay Victor's for all these my
abetik are precise the eyebrow pencil in
the shade number six just to fill them
in Victor actually gets pretty good for
Alice I just tweet that before we
started this video should benefit yeah
use 10% off for change I don't have a
coat of that now you do oh my god your
brow looks so good suffices for this one
yeah that's like what I like
trips we get together I won't ever say
that was pretty cool
second sentence is no serve I didn't get
to do as a someone behind the camera so
dot uses plus one widely my hurt memory
of me and Victor together snuggly
honestly like right now I know that
sounds so stupid but I've been trying to
get Victor to the city with me for so
long I don't think it really cool that
Victor is like a straight married man
and was like letting me put makeup on
his face because he's like my best
friend in the entire world so that's
cool and it means a lot to me and I
notice it is going to do well but you
guys better splash sound like button and
our daddy where do we do his makeup I
see it is fully sponsored adidas I do
this Chipotle friend zombie on Twitter
tonight so disrespectful somebody
tweeted about them taunting me and I
quote treat it an early we love that
you're such a good fan James suddenly
I'm never having my beautiful white boys
no be chicken mild sauce and lettuce
teasing walk ever again Victor I have a
question for you that what's your
favorite makeup look do you ever see me
where easy flashback memories
oh my god iconic I'm going to set
Victor's bronze plates using the Anasazi
on tinted brow gel which is Brussels
that right there is a brow go to good
Alex how mad would you be if I just went
off I would get up and leave don't you
try that are amazing me and Whoopi
35 oh I should I'll tell it I want to do
a halo eye on Victor because you know a
lot like we should do something fun why
do you think a halo eye is going to
consist of I know what is a killer
well a halo eye mr. Victor basically
we're gonna have the darker shade on the
outside yeah and then there's going to
make a pop of brightness in the middle
is okay I'm just going to start off
beating my Sigma e35 at tapered blending
brush and put this dark II orange shade
into the crease line under seasoned
shade is my transition color I'm really
not going to try to do like too dark or
too intense i halo I'd I won't feel like
very light and soft especially because
if we stay here for seven hours doing I
look on Victor I'll probably end up
stabbing me so well three times x time
to grab my morphe r39 brush and dip into
a medium brown orange e shade to use as
like the transition to start off
deepening the halo effect use code James
Wow
a true to have you right back I'm really
focusing my color on the outer and inner
corners of the eye and then running up
into the creases the slightest Pat but
making sure to leave the middle of the
lid myself
kind of empty next to that same exact
brush I'm going to dip into a little bit
darker of a brown shade and then place
that on the very inner and outer corners
all right did you really
and I believe that marthy Abbot one four
nine nine grab my darkest Brown and
really deep it up at the internet
recorder and that like last final
darkening shades how do you remember the
numbers on the breast they say right
here yeah once you use them a lot of
times I have live advice just how you
memorize like locations in the warehouse
where the clothes go now you're speaking
my language when you get like offended
or annoyed you hear really really bad
and then you're really annoying
about it like you can't like at a close
kind of like you dealt with it anything
anybody else says are you being annoying
that it makes me feel like test
well great answer but it is when you
think you're always right
that's like you though no we're both
that way no yeah no thank you yeah the
difference is no games taking a little
the difference is you always think
you're right put here we'll know
yeah I keep quiet when I think I'm right
but there's some things that you don't
miss it I don't think about it squirrel
I keep quite a lot of times or things
things that I could have a pinion up but
I don't change because it's not worth it
but when I feel like you're truly wrong
is when I I step in and I say something
oh it's not out of here so that's dude
oh I didn't do it in a sweet way how
does it feel now that I'm 18 and I'm no
longer your legal responsibility as a
father it's great free men
I get rid of you for 18 years I'm going
to my mac 242 brush a little bit of the
Urban Decay all later as you just saw
and I'm going to put this right on the
center of the victors lit as like the
pop of bright nests for the halo I
they go back into play our 39 person
that's gonna make sure that those edges
are really really diffused out for the
lower last thing we needs the same brush
from before I'm just going to look up
for me oh my god what your eyes just did
something really ugly you can't do it
tickle yeah get over for last time I was
mr. Victor we're gonna be using the lily
lashed in style on Miami
alright guys and that is what I'll
complete over on mr. Victor how do you
feel with the bar very uncomfortable I
totally wasn't the easiest way in the
world this is why people complain on
wanting to take the makeup off at the
end of the day everything's fine until
you put these latches on I'm so sorry
you're so great thank you for sharing
your story
alright guys we're gonna go ahead &amp;amp;
fitch other eye off-camera so we're not
sitting here for a long time we'll be
right back and we will finish off the
rest of the face okay guys now that the
lashes are both on Victor is about to
cry right now because he thinks in the
uncomfortable but he looks beautiful and
that's what matters right I look
beautiful before now we're going to move
on to is the highlighter is insert
amusing the Oprah Rodeo Drive when we
all think that it's going to look really
really good on Victor's skin tone so
we're going to get the glow on use
coaching to apply my line I'm going to
use my morphe r-36 brush yeah oh that is
a glow mani emulate is shaking macdaddy
just fell over and died Geoffrey star

river then we're gonna try to fix
Victor's broken nose one last time using
this the pilot air still look broken for

picked up some because they're going to
look really good on Victor's skin tone
is it going to we're going to find out
damn Kylie Jenner is shaking right now
can you open your eyes they're heavy
with the foot and our last and final
step for this land on such a vector is
going to be to set it so it stays locked
in place all night long for five minutes
