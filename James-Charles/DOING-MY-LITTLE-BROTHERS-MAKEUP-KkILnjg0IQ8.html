back to my youtube channel so as you can
see once again I have a very very
special guest joining me here today my
little brother
Iain you guys absolutely smashed the
fricken like on our my little brother
does eye makeup video it was definitely
an interesting look to say the least
how did you feel about doing makeup for
the first time very difficult in the
last video I did make you guys a promise
and I said if we got 50,000 like I would
sit little Ian down once again and we
would do another video where I just his
makeup I think it is time for Ian to get
a full grand makeover because lord knows
my look was not to full glam or a
quality makeover so we're going to give
it on Ian today how do you feel about
that I'm not very excited have you ever
worn makeup before on my hickeys yeah
okay alright so we have our paint goodie
drink ities and we are ready to get glam
let's do this so I'm first going to
start off by priming it sister Ian say
season the benefit Porefessional primer
so you know obviously a teenager he is
15 years old which is one question that
we didn't answer in the last video so
Ian definitely has a teenager skin right
now and he does get breakouts relatively
often but that's okay everybody does so
pore fessional definitely help to like
fill in his pores and make your skin
nice and smooth so for foundations
around abusing the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation stick in the shade
why three six five now you guys know I'm
usually between why 215 and why is 335
enos definitely blessed a little bit
more of a tan than I am I had to have a
fake one but he is all not around so
we're gonna be using this one today
which is hopefully going to be a good
match and oh boy yeah it looks like it
is how are you feeling about this so far
she was like peanut butter you know it
does support concerns that are using the
tape tape concealer in the shade
light/medium honey now ironically enough
this is actually one of the products
that you picked up for our video
together already those as you know this
is one of my all-time favorites so we're
going to use this on him as well today I
know I had to do white in the dark but I
don't think I did that right yeah
no not exactly I'm really really excited
to contour Ian's nose so he becomes like
out of his entire face that is the one
feature that he got from either my mom
or my dad I don't even know who has this
nose but I wish I had this nose because
of this nose sister right up in here
it's a bitch to contour and we all know
that for sure then I'm gonna say ants
basically using Laura Mercier terms as a
setting powder and my Beauty Blender and
just press that right under the eyes
nope
don't raise your eyebrows look up there
you go perfect
the to contour and face today I'm going
to use my morphe M 570 brush and my
comedy shade and light palette as always
and I won't dip into the medium shade so
we're looking at questions on my phone
from you guys on Twitter while we do in
makeup to answer some of your crisis
questions once again similar to the last
video because you got so many cool and
funny one and so yes this question is
for you and have you had any weird
experiences with fans oh yeah honey my
fans been really weird to you at the
meet up in New York City they asked my
snapchat stuff but it's not chatted me
that I'm blocked oh happy asked what's
it like being so fucking annoying looks
like being so fucking rude fuck you Kat
Cassandra asked which one is better at
singing oh you literally turned out
pretty much missing me oh I can do it No
Jaclyn asked can you all impersonate
each other
oh god my sisters has got my pink kitty
drinka t do I really sound like that
yeah basically hey guys it's me and
today we're gonna go play some
that was an awful person age alright so
Lance face is baking in the oven at 350
degrees I have my benefit from sizing I
brought pants on the shade number six
and we're going to slightly ins Brown oh

think you could name on vine boy boy
Shawn Mendes yeah let me set the brows
and please use my benefit gimme brow in
the shade at number five their last two
is straighter very posh so friends look
today he asked me not to do any
eyeshadow and since I did for some to
sit down and do this video 3 and the
first times I figured fine sister I'll
honor his wishes so we're going to go
right onto the lashes and mascara
somebody's a benefit roller lash today
it has really really long last but he
also has super hooded eyelid so this is
extremely difficult to like actually get
in there and not o get mascara
everywhere just like I just did fucked

so for laughs today I'm actually gonna
pop on the Lily lashes in the south
Miami's you guys all the theaters on my

Hollywood illuminator you guys know this

uncomfortable and it hurts my lashes
burning but at the end of the day it's
just makeup and it wipes off so it's not
that big of a deal I guess hey major

in the entire world Ian for doing the
city with me obviously it is not like
society's thing for straight guys to
wear makeup that came out weird you know
what I mean and it was really really
cool for him to be able to sit down or
