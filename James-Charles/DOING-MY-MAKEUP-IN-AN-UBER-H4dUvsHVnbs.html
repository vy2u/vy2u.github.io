welcome Barclay use your channel so I
just got out of a meeting in Santa
Monica which if you know la is probably
on the west side and I currently have to
go to a fitting and then a red carpet
tonight and then a dinner and then a
movie so today's going to be an
absolutely crazy night and the one
problem is that is currently for 1/2
p.m. and that means there is LA traffic
and if you live in LA you know that la
traffic is no joke and is like our long
ventures no matter where you go and I
currently have to go to Hollywood which
isn't gonna be in the car for at least
an hour which is not the best so I have
sister Anthony with me and I packed all
eye makeup goodies and here because I
knew this is gonna happen and I planned
accordingly like the good sister I am I
have all my makeup ready and I just
called an uber frostburg currently at a
gas station and I'm gonna be filming a
get ready in the end and uber video
today I'm a little spooked I don't know
how this is gonna go hopefully the ride
isn't bumpy hopefully my face looks
beats by the end of it but this is gonna
be a major time crunch so if you guys
wanna see to get ready in an uber keep
watching we walk to a gas station with a
because both of us sisters have to pee
and we're gonna get our uber from here
but I have only makeup goodies right
here all pumped up and I have my Beauty
Blender which we need to of course wet
and get nice
good simply winkeny here that we're just
gonna get her nice and moist city boys
today
Harper James let's go
how's the landing there it's good really
yeah okay so I have all my stop sign out
here in the back seat I'm gonna keep it
nice and clean not trying to mess up
this car I'm gonna start off with my
beauty blender foundation and I'm not
realizing that I didn't bring them here
either so I guess I only have money here
which is very musty in my shade and
light palette so I'm sorry anybody who
has motion sickness I've recently been
using a new combination of foundation
which I'm starting off with my Giorgio
Armani luminous silk and I like to add
like a few like one pump of my ball in
this way by Too Faced which you guys
know I stand by and also tiny bit of the
anasazi liquid glow and I've been using
the shade of pearl I just like a really
really dewy skin base I don't know why I
also know I'm doing all these liquids
cause y'all know but I love my HD stick
and a stuff Li new free but okay so like
I said I just had a very very exciting
meeting to hear all about and I promise
you'll be hearing soon so keep your ears
and your eyes peeled for a very very fun
movie premiere that way
managers brother is actually working on
so I'm going to walk the red carpet and
looking lamp but y'all know me I were
the same damn outfit every time I walk
about carpet so I'm going to get saddled
tonight which I'm super excited for
because I never really get to get styled
and have like overly like professional
outfit so that should be fun and we're
currently headed over there right now
but like I said Kelly traffic a little
bit spooky especially this
and we are how long to stay we are away
about 20 minutes okay sir about 20
minutes wait for the stylist and then
from there we have to go to the carpet
so I need to get glam fast
my base is all Ottoman of course he's my
tart shape tape concealer and this is in
the shade light medium and I'm gonna put
this between my pants carefully and try
not to spill if anywhere and then of
course
so far not as hard to do makeup in a
moving vehicle as I thought it would be
but then again we haven't really gotten
to anything serious I anticipate the
brows being a little challenging this is
funny I feel like we're filming a
documentary eight oh my god speaking of
this week I actually went to Demi
Lovato's document April obviously if you
guys watch banner or snapchat to
literally follow me everything in this
body but if you guys want me you know
that I went and it was literally one of
the most fun nights of my entire life
I was actually freaking personally
invited by WGME on Instagram as a girl
you need to go and I was like sister I'm
there so it was just a magical
experience I got to meet her we took
photos together she was just so nice I
generally look up to Demi it's so much
because she's been through so much in
this cut up so strong and also she just
has literally like the best voice in all
of history so just an amazing experience
you guys have to check out her new movie
when it comes out on October 17th this
is not sponsored just we are in traffic
hour as well like I said so the sauna is
looking really weird right now so I
apologize that the lighting is a little
wonky they're gonna have to deal with it
because I'm dealing with that barely I'm
gonna grab my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder too
really careful of this because my father
not get this everywhere Illuminati
confirmed stupid what else is new if you
think filming you dipping into your
crimes I mean if you want to there's not
much to see that anywhere itself look at
my hoodie I'm wearing on use cold jeans
we're tempers our hoodie and black which
is not available in sis's - Japan home
because it's sold out but all the other
sisters merch is available on sisters -
apparel calm which you should totally
check out and shop if you're our true
sister also speaking of 10% off we are
in a call right now and y'all know
sister James wants customer with a
coupon code so if you'd like the five
dollars off of your first ride
use code James D one five four three two
you II couldn't get even more annoying I
roll my brushes in this like little
carrying case which I think it's from
and I'm gonna use my benefit hoola
bronzer as always this brush from
japonesque to bronze my face I've
recently been loving this brush you guys
know that I'm a purveyor of the Barbie
m57 brush when it comes to bronzing but
I recently had this one for the first
time a few days ago and I really really
love it there's just a lot software lets
you get like wait are we here yeah yeah
this is the address here god ok so just
is running a little way I'm gonna have
to speed this process up but let's go
get fitted
okay so she's a baking 350 degrees let's
try not so close
you definitely look interesting right oh
I'm sorry lux yeah I'll look away
give them style me I need some help
Valentine's Day non-existent boyfriends
what is this it looks better on honestly
don't hate it
Anthony this is just like speaking to me
maybe you should hang up or send us a
voicemail this look really good wait let
me see your back I mean honestly for
what we're working with back there it
looks good Anthony oh you're so good I
literally never walk carpets or go to
events and I'm actually confident happy
with what I'm wearing I love this okay
guys so we just got the oven and now the
event currently starts and I think
that's away so we're going to get back
in the zubur and we're gonna grab
because this is not red carpet ready
and I'm doing my eyebrows now this is
not the most easy thing to do it and
it's black okay it's so weird seeing you
from the side without your highlight
I mean it's usually facetune on anybody
sound okay the fact that there's traffic
right now is actually playing in my
favor because we keep stopping
yeah clean you're keeping it back there
yeah unlike your reputation um good luck
just my face using my skin to navy out
and makeup finishing spray oh my god so
guys so not only that I get to go to a
really fun it will be prepared sweet but
the Demi Lovato thing like I said
earlier flashback was also in the studio
almost all week long working on a few
new songs that'll be coming out soon for
your eyes I am let me just so excited
because like working on the script is
doing such a nice breath of fresh air
for me it's what some of my best friends
and obviously you guys know that music
is a huge part of my life and a huge
passion of mine so just like having this
is like a nice break from the makeup
growth because y'all know going crazy
has been really really fun working a lot
of your songs
you guys so shy but you know so keep
your ears peeled can I have two really
right now which I'm a little spooked
about because once again nose contouring
in a moving vehicle I would not wish on
my worst enemy
okay we have just the tip down Oh makes
you feel any better they make up looks
great in a super dark moving vehicle oh
thank you so much sweetie I guess I'm
just not gonna do I don't say because
that sounds like the worst idea ever
Miami of course oh I almost think you
know these Miami's
either way it's just a lash Oh sister
don't ever judge us are clearly lost
memories like that ever again please go
cut the tapes thank God I have to pee so
bad
I somehow miraculously managed to glue
on both eyelashes and I'm just doing it
mascara really carefully because this
could be a disaster the longest bottom
lashes effort you know
we love a confident queen hi and I think
my last was gonna be I hope you take a
really sharp turn so that you just have
like a line of lipstick across your face
why would you ever okay so we are all
done and we are running a little bit
late but we did manage to get our entire
face done over the course of the last
few hours in a moving vehicle this is
not easy but we accomplished this and
I'm proud of us even though this look is
the most basic as I can possibly get I'm
really surprised once again I'm gonna
give ourselves a quick spritz of the
Marc Jacobs decadence for a few so good
alright guys so that was so much fun the
red carpet wasn't slate I felt so good
and my luck and then the movie furnace
Cobra as well it was so good
I'm not gonna come too close I had such
a fun time but this bigger than storm
for far far too long we were looking a
little bit crusty a little bit dusty
sister Brittany brought me some makeup
boys on about her smooth this face ah
but all that being said thank you guys
so much for watching today's get ready
with me in an uber video this was an
interesting experience at least it was
done a lot harder than expected but I
think I didn't do that out of a job for
the time I was given what was going on
in the car at the bunks and also the
lighting at the end because they quickly
became at nighttime which was about the
easiest thing in the world if you guys
enjoyed today's video please don't
forget to give it a big thumbs up down
