back to my youtube channel for today's
that I have a super super fun makeup
challenge plan for a lovely video I got
ready in the complete pitch-black
darkness which was so intense
the results were spooky to the leaves if
you guys have not checked out last
week's video be sure to click right up
here and go check it out but I had so
much fun doing and I really don't do
makeup challenges that often so I wanted
to do another one today mostly because
I'm running out of Betty ideas but oh
they'll be very very fun and this is one
challenge you guys have been requesting
for so long it is always one of the top
comments on my videos this challenge
breaks all laws of makeup and that is
doing my makeup backwards all makeup
lovers both professional artists and
average makeup wears how about we like
to call a makeup routine I personally
like to start off with my face then
eyebrows and eyes then lashes that lips
then finishing touches that I don't like
to do a different routine some people
start with their eyebrows some people
start with their eyes don't even ask me
how they do that but obviously the end
goal no matter where you start is to
look beautiful and confident for today's
video I'm gonna only make up knowledge
upside down and do a makeup routine
backwards starting with settings for it
and then finishing off with foundation
which is normally my first thing I think
you guys get the point at this point
this should be intense I don't know who
the originator heir so I don't know who
to give credit to but I know both Dante
and Michael Finch have done an please go
check out the videos they're absolutely
amazing content creators I love them
both but everyone who has done this has
been using their normal makeup products
in the opposite order for me I'm gonna
do everything in the opposite order but
I did switch out a few products that I
knew would really really mess everything
up because I do want to try to make this
the best looking result possible even
while still doing it backwards you guys
know what I mean long story short I am
so excited for this so without further
ado if you'd like to see my makeup
routine completely backwards let's get
started
all right sister so I'm starting all
this up today by going in with my
morphia prep and set settings right and
we're just going to mist my entire face
as a base to this makeup obviously this
would normally be my last step but since
it's the prep and sat hopefully this
will still work if you know what I'm
saying
second to last a makeup routine you guys
know I usually finish off my looks with
a liquid lipstick first today's video
I'm gonna use the anasazi liquid
lipstick in the shade Archon I really
really love the shade and I think it'll
match really really well with the look
that I have plans fingers crossed that
the eyes go out suddenly we have no idea
what its gonna look like I am a little
bit worried about this though because
well I love the anasazi look of
lipsticks and all of their colors they
are a little bit drying so hopefully
throughout this entire video and throw
out the talking they don't get like
crusted Sahara Desert status at the end
we'll see this looks so strange hello
before lifts I'm usually finishing off
my eyes with lashes and mascara normally
I like to do at lashes and then blend
them together with the mascara because I
personally have a really really hard
time at putting on lashes but for
today's video we have to do mascara
first about Masha so lord help me and
this situation we might have a very very
gia Gunn wonky loss situation but for
today's they don't gonna be using the
benefit BADgal bang mascara this is
their brand new a 36 hour of
illuminating mascara I just got back for
an amazing trip at I'm on gearing with
Benefit Cosmetics if you don't follow me
on SAP you definitely should I posted
everything over there was so much fun
but we were celebrating the launch of
this mascara and it is literally so so
so so good if you guys have not yet
checked out this baby you definitely
have to do you see how pretty my
eyelashes look right now hello Benefit
girl you snapped
so next obviously comes lashes and for
today's video of course I'm going to use
my Lily lashes on Miami's these are my
all-time favorite lashes and I also just
recently found out you can use KO James
for 10% off of these I know some of you
guys have used it before but I didn't
even know that existed so hey if you
ever want to check out my all-time
favorite lashes coat James gets you
money off you're welcome okay second
time's the charm
she's on there I think the one thing
that's really good about this challenge
is that my eyeliner is gonna come after
my lashes so I get to hide all the
mistakes that I just made whoa before
doing my lashes I normally lined my
waterline so today I'm gonna do that
using the pretty vulgar nude liner
and then comes lowered lashline shadow
and for today's look I'll gonna be using
the Jacqueline hell our subtle palette I
guess you have to go from darkest to
lightest which is not what I normally
like to do but we're gonna have to make
it work I'm first gonna grab an Emma
5:08 this is just a tiny little blending
brush and grab this dark brown shade
right and here and buff this right up
against the lash line I am of course
planning on waiting too so I'm just
gonna pull this out slightly in the
outer corner to make sure that that's
blended together and there's no like
really awkward divide I'm next to the
government makeup shock t61 brush and
dip into this ready shade right here and
use that to buff out the brown I'm
placing that right below and making sure
that there's no harsh edges really using
that to diffuse out the brown because we
do not want it to look like we just got
punched in the eye
but of course leaving room because we
don't want to pull it too far down
finally I'm gonna go over Smith 247
brush and dip into this bright orange
and this kind of mac and cheese shade
right here mixed together and then just
buff that out so far actually not that
bad moving on to my upper lid my last of
my eye looks is always eyeliner if I'm
wearing it and for today's look yes it
does include eyeliner so I'm gonna turn
up the Tom Ford I'll enter pen and
attempt to sketch out a way go over top
my lashes oh God
Hey did I just do it when it comes to
this challenges you guys might like to
go big or go home
and normally next to be eyeshadow but
for this look I want to do I'm probably
gonna regret this
hey glitter cut crease so I've got the
BH Cosmetics glitters in the shades
sapphire and mermaid blue and also the
violet boss a glitter adhesive normally
yes I would do this first then this but
let's be real these are never gonna
stick so get over it it's not that deep
I'm just gonna ply these with the darker
blue in the outer corner I'm bringing
into the teal and hopefully we'll be
able to make this look really cute do
you see this how long look at how good
that crease sighs I feel like we might
be able to make this work to start off
the actual cut crease I'm gonna go back
to the light chocolate eyeshadow palette
and my e39 brush and start off with this
dark brown shade once again so much of
the lower lash line and go right above
that crease
okay interesting I'm not gonna get that
same I'm 508 brush from before and dip
into that same bright red shade and
blend out that line if any of you guys
watching they're like oh gee sisters you
know that this is the technique I used
to use all the time for doing up creases
I have more recently actually switched
into the normal technique of doing it
when starting off with the lightest
shadow and then working weight in and
then just cutting it but I used to do
all my Conte creases by sketching out
the line first and then I'm blending
upward so I think I may have the upper
hand in this but clearly it's not
looking too great so far so I don't know
I'm gonna really carefully blend that
out clearly she needs a little bit of
work using the bright orange in it from
before
and then finally gonna grab that mac and
cheese taper before and just go right
over those edges what's actually working
you my favorite here is that sense they
don't have an eyeshadow base on if
anything gets too intense I can just go
over with my blending brush and just
scrub really really hard and it'll
actually take off some of that product
since it doesn't have anything to really
stick to okay so that is what I all
complete obviously we still have some
work to do but I'm gonna go ahead and do
another one off-camera and the same
exact order I promise and I'll be right
back alright knock about 30 minutes
later and that is a second eye all
complete and this should be proof that I
never cheat during challenges even off
camera because this eye is not looking
the best so before eyes my makeup
routine ways comes my eyebrows but I
always fill them in and then use my brow
gel and then clean them up since this is
reverse I'm gonna grab it some concealer
and go right under this and be super
super careful and not to overlap the eye
shadow and then fill the man wish me
luck
I have to try to imagine where I'm going
to actually fill in the eyebrow
that looks about right
maybe I'm gonna grab a synthetic bullet
brush this is the e36 and buff that out
being really really careful to not mess
up the eyeshadow that I worked so hard
on okay honestly that doesn't even look
at that bad but now I have no idea how
we're gonna fill these in without
messing up I really rely on that
concealer afterwards to fill in my brows
today I'm gonna use the iconic brow
cushion in the shade medium sister
nikkietutorials and true Sui to this in
our collab and I feel like I'll be able
to be really precise with this at an
angle brush since it is a liquid of
formula hopefully
okay you know what a little bit dark but
I feel like we can work with bass okay
that is the other bra I'll complete once
again not lying about this good brow a
brow let's move on so now that the lips
eyes and brows are all complete it is
time for the base makeup now it is so
weird too because a lot of people
actually start their base makeup with
eyes and brows already done but for me
that is something that is very very new
to me I don't do that like ever so this
is definitely gonna be a major major
challenge normally when it comes to my
base makeup you guys know that likes to
use my powder products but for today's
video like I said I do want to switch on
my products just a little bit to really
try my best to make this a successful
look so out of my base makeup my last
step is always a highlighter so for
today I'm gonna use the brand new Mary
do manizer from the balm which is a
liquid highlight I'm gonna put this
right in the same places as my normal oh
wow that's really pretty
okay I'm gonna put this into normal
pieces as all my highlights usually go
in the inner corners then I'm just gonna
take my damp Beauty Blender and I'm
going to blend it right out oh you're
kidding wow that's blinding no love best
whoa I definitely need to try to sell
again in a video where I'm not like
completely messing up my makeup so
before a highly obviously comes a
contour and normally I would use my Kat
Von D shade and light palette but like I
said I'm not gonna use powders cuz we
obviously have to do a foundation and
concealer later on and that just gets
really really messy so I will use my
benefit hoola cream contouring stick
instead I'm just gonna go right in all
the hollows of my face a little bit on
the forehead tell you know reduce that
hairline because lord knows sister needs
it on the jaw line to really snatch her
up and then also right down the bridge
of the nose you guys for this video I
definitely do not think we're gonna have
a snatched nose and I am
very sad about it then once again it's
gonna take my damp Beauty Blender and
buff that right in oh that is a little
orange well you're a little recanting me
I look like I was doing my makeup
outside on a really sunny day and only
did my eyes in my brows and then fell
asleep and woke up like seven hours
later with a sunburn what is going on oh
this was so good okay say this one I
hadn't grabbed my iconic London a cream
contour kit and I'm gonna go end it with
this shade right down here to both
darken up the contours but also cool
them down just a little bit because
clearly this is not what we want okay
yeah much better a little intense but we
can fix this we got this in the bag
pretend that little meltdown never
happened
this is scary so before contouring
highlighting and blush obviously comes
concealer and at the foundation but in
between those is the powder and if you
guys are a makeup lover you know that
the number one rule and makeup is that
it's really really just illegal like the
police welcome for you if you put a
cream product over powder it's just the
firm laws and the texture and the
chemistry behind it just makes them not
really work together but that's today's
challenge we have to do it now I'm just
gonna use a light amount of my Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder mix
together my Too Faced sweet peach powder
I'm just gonna grab my damp Beauty
Blender and dip right in and just apply
a really really really light layer to
the entire face to set it in place and
hopefully not to disrupt the foundation
told you there are the police bit so now
so another way face is all set in place
before that step comes concealer and of
course I'm using my turn
shave tube in the shade light neutral
and I'm actually kind of happy that this
step is coming on before foundation
because I think I can kind of use this
to my advantage to really carve out my
mistakes being the eyebrows of course
the nose contour the lips and the
contour so everything is like ready and
more clean for the foundation we could
pull this together let's see I'm of
course gonna put this right in the
center of my forehead of for
highlighting okay just cut that brow a
little bit but you know what maybe it's
for the better
well this is an interesting look to say
the least
yes thank God for beauty blenders
because they really do fix anything
my contour literally looks like Trixie
Mattel from RuPaul's Drag Race I'm
coming for you girl my god
this kids is why you did not put creams
or liquid over powder because once that
is set in place whenever you put over
top will not blend oh no oh this needs
to blend out oh my lord I cannot have
this contour of my own right now
so my base has gone from nothing and
very very pimply inbred - way to orange
- way too dark
- now way too light and still very
uneven so obviously the next step and
last step is going to be foundation
normally you guys know I use the Too
Faced for other things just like my
all-time favorite hold it girl
foundation it is so so so good but I
will say for my skin type it is a
hydrating foundation that does not dry
down and since this is the last step
that I do not have powder to modify and
save the day I'm gonna go with the LA
girl Pro matte new foundation in the
shade stand these just launched and I
watch a review on them and apparently
these do dried down never try these
before so this could be an absolute
disaster but fingers crossed that this
hopefully finishes us up very very
nicely because I feel like where we're
at right now this look is not that bad
I'm just gonna go into my same Beauty
Blender and really lightly it go right
over the entire face
you guys wait a second this actually
kinda looks good before foundation
usually comes a primer but you guys know
I stopped using it a long long time ago
because I've always messed up my nose
contour so I guess this works my
advantage because I think I'm done okay
you guys looking in the mirror right now
I am shucks out of my mind not even
gonna lie I picked this look today
because I want to challenge myself but
mostly because I thought this is gonna
be a major fail and would make for some
really comedic content listen you gotta
do what you gotta do YouTube just is not
the same anymore but I feel like this
challenge we're such a success all right
