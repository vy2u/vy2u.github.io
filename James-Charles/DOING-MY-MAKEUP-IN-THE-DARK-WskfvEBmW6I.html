welcome back to my youtube channel I
feel like it has been literally as so
long since I've lost in you guys I am so
sorry for the lack of videos that have
been coming out I've been so incredibly
busy with a lot of stuff of my personal
life but we're back we're ready to go
it has also been a long time since I've
worn a black leather baseball hat in the
video but you know what this is what
we're dealing with today
you're welcome for the Hat first today's
video I actually have a super fun at
challenge playing that I've never tried
before and I'm honestly absolutely
horrified to test out but you know what
it's probably gonna be really funny for
you guys to watch puddling that is super
super vital to both beauty videos and
just makeup in general is light when you
guys watch my videos at home you get to
watch a very very nice and beautiful
pretty setup but I shoot with two huge
huge huge lights that are hanging right
above my head they're very very
expensive as well and they do a very
nice job of lighting this whole room and
making me look very very pretty so for
today's video what we're gonna do is
lose them and I'm gonna do my
territories and makeup in the dark
despite the fact that I thought my
videos the two very very expensive
lights I also film it with a very very
expensive camera which upon further
research I learned does not have a
nighttime mode of course so to fix this
problem I went to Best Buy today and
picked up this also very very expensive
camera that I'll probably never use
again that looks like it's from 1984 but
apparently it has a really good at night
mission mode so fingers crossed that
this video goes well I thought of this
challenge earlier on today I thought it
would be such a funny video to do I've
never seen it done before but I looked
it up and apparently buzz we did it a
few years ago so credit to them do not
attack me for stealing and their video
idea and without further ado if you like
to see me doing makeup in complete
darkness keep on watching hello
so here now the absolute pitch block
I've turned every single laid off in my
apartment and closed all my curtains all
I can see is just like basic shapes and
outlines and I have a mirror right here
okay no not because I put it there and
I'm looking in it and I can see
absolutely nothing so this should be
really great so not only can I not see
what I'm doing but for once in my life
today coincidentally I decided to be
organized and put everything back in
storage so I'm gonna have to pick up all
my makeup products before this video not
being able to see it what they are lord
please help me get to this without
another scandal let's go okay so first
we need a primer so I know that my
skincare drawer is right here I think I
know this is the touch of water cream
okay next its foundation which is in the
toilet here Oh God
okay I know this is a makeup forever
sick but I have way too many shades of
that that is what are you too risky of a
game to be playing today oh I know
exactly what that is
that's canceled okay I think this is to
phase four this way because I know the
TF logo is right on top and like
engraved letters but I have no idea what
shade this is and I just bought four new
shades so this might go really bad
really fast next is a concealer which I
know is really cool this is definitely
thar shave tape this feels very empty
wait that's a good thing that means I
use it right hey welcome to contour
definitely yeah so next set your blush
comes highlighter
why am I forgetting my makeup routine
discuss I'm in the dark okay that's
gonna be here okay this is the new
Anasazi I'm really a highlighter I think
I hope the next after hand later comes
brows which i think is right above my oh
there's benefical brown eye shadow so
let's head back down to the palette or
no I want to do they get a worm tone
kafka crease I obviously do those a lot
so I think I know the technique behind
that and I think that'll be relatively
okay leader try to replicate today I
have no ideas or that or that
this feels dirty really really dirty
okay this is definitely multi palette oh
I think this might be the john help out
oh this is definitely the 39a this is
too big to be a regular palette hello
so I'm gonna go ahead and pick this
palette I know that this one is a 39a
but I actually don't have the shades
like memorized so I'm too scared of
doing something very ugly with that and
I think that this might be the John help
out so this one that looks like it'd be
a good contender hopefully so next I
need an eyeliner which I know is right
above the eyebrow drawer so that would
be here I think yeah right here
Oh what did I just do oh I doesn't want
to attempt to do a full on it
so I'm looking for a black liquid liner
I have no idea how ever gonna find oh
just kidding this is the Kat Von D
tattoo liner bingo ah what is all these
drawers not closing what is my on Oh
setting spray well he definitely need ah
oh
let's grab yes that's is lips oh god
this could go really wrong let's call
this one oh my god not sad I say and I'm
gonna start by priming my face that I
used in what I hope is my touch out
water cream moisturizer I really really
love this and it is really really great
that's what it feels so gross because
I'm so it's taking addressed right now
like this is not what I wanna be doing
but this is either born this way or it
could also be luminous silk I knew there
so I hate that foundation I'm gonna do
three pumps there it is on the back of
my hand oh yeah there's nothing funny in
there uh-huh uh-huh
I think this is very similar to the no
mirror makeup challenge being that I
obviously cannot see what I'm doing
except for the fact that there is a
mirror right there I just still can't
see myself definitely need Strummer to
blend on the neck because if this is the
wrong foundation shade that's gonna be
our only saving grace that might
disguise it a little bit okay so next up
is going to be our concealer which no
definitely not is right here okay oh
this is definitely shave table oh right
on the nose bridge
bring it em out same thing on the other
side that's the key to this house
definitely gonna be to blend blend blend
blend blend because clearly I cannot see
anything that's going on I know there's
a mirror right there but won't you
and then comes our Beautyblender dip it
right in oh gosh
next comes contour which I know I have
my Kat Von D shade light palette for but
I need to find my contouring brush and I
know that all my brushes are organized
from smallest so I have my like detail
brushes that I have lighting brushes
that I have face brushes right here so
this been it's gonna be where I'm gonna
want to choose this one from this might
be actually this is a fan brush no that
should not even be in there imagine I
put it on and there's like blue eye
shadow on it holy crap I'm going to go
right in on my cheek bone which is right
about here how do you just oh how do you
just sit there with your annoying ass
car and just let it honk like that for
like an hour it's in just going and
going and going
collect your car this has been a PSI I
need to move now next we're gonna do
some highlighter quickly and we're gonna
use what I hope is the Anasazi rocks are
easy new highlighter oh you see that
glow me either okay also gonna put it
right above the brow bone like always
okay that should be good
I'm gonna grab my Beauty Blender again
and dip it into oh shoot I'm gonna judge
by the noise of all the snot and right
now is that I'm definitely hitting the
right place okay so now it is eyebrow at
any time horrified for but let's do this
I'm gonna start off in the front and
bring it up towards the tail which i
think is over here
I hope bring it out and then back up I'm
scared now just lean underneath my
eyebrows which I know I need my Mac so
like to cover up for so I'm gonna put
this on
the back of my hand a little squirt and
I also need a flattop concealer brush
which should be amazing try to find in
this is this my eyebrow bone yeah oh my
god my eyelids feel why this is gross
okay so next looks the part that I'm
absolutely dreading and that I'm sure
you're all excited for the eye shadow
like I said I have no idea what pile
this even is fingers crossed that it's
the joseline Hill palette
I have a strong inkling that it may be
but I could be very very wrong so if
this is a palette that I think it is I
do use this palette quite a lot so I
think I have a pretty good idea of where
the colors are and I think that the
third shade from the top is a light
transition shade wait is it the one
below it I can really cannot tell where
my actual creases this is not good I
usually do one eye at a time but I don't
trust myself to remember the colors that
I use and I also doubtful do not trust
myself to be able to find the brushes
again in a few minutes so I guess we're
gonna do both eyes at the same time oh
god just keep blending just keep
blending blending blending oh love that
sister voice cry yeah next gonna grab
another fluffy brush and try to deepen
up the this feels like an m4 33 okay
well the right shock I'm gonna place
this right on my outer area imagine I
think I'm doing like a warm tone half
cut crease and by the end of the video I
turn the lights on and I have a blue
smokey eye on with my luck I wouldn't
even be surprised okay so now we're
gonna have the crease colors all in
place I'm gonna take the Stila liquid
metals in whatever shade this is and I'm
going to carve out my crease uh-huh
uh-huh oh I think that was to go to
crease cutting I felt that one even in
the dark you're still gonna have our
little fans more okay I'm next I'm just
going to be winged liner is oh right
here Oh
if this look turned out any sort of good
by some miracle this is where this is
where we lose it sisters
oh hey that could be good I think this I
might be a lot easier this is always my
better eye for eyeliner oh I forgot to
fill it in no I'm gonna leave it at that
okay we're almost done
thank God it is getting so dark I'm
literally falling asleep while doing
this next up we have lashes God let's
undo the pasta oh god I forgot about the
whole tweezer situation wait I have to
cut these two scissors in the dark
sounds like the worst idea ever in the
entire world though that's my finger
okay oh that does not feel right she's
on there
I think Oh
hello okay I feel like that could be
relatively correct this whole area feels
very very sticky which is telling me
that I probably got glue in an area that
should not contain glue and now I'm
concerned
okay now that lashes are all on we have
mascara and for this I think I picked up
my benefit roller lash if I am correct
so I'm going to oh god oh god I'm
actually horrified of this between
mascara with lights on is literally
already scary enough and I'm somehow
managing to do this in complete darkness
you know what if I poked myself I'm
already pretty much blind at this point
I might as well finish it off oh just
like that oh and last but certainly not
least we have lipstick which i think is
an overlook of lipstick I really it
could not see or smell much but with a
little amount of nasal passageway I have
left
oh no this is shave tape we have
lipstick which i think is Oprah yeah
definitely over our house that very like
cupcake e-type smell uh-huh uh-huh got
over line just a little bit oh that was
a lotta bit okay I think we're done oh
we have to set our face in place okay
okay I think I'm ready for the reveal
I'm honestly horrified but lets her
night-vision off one two three oh my god
oh that was a lot okay
hello oh oh oh god I'm scared
this is interesting it just hit at least
let's go back through it step by step we
started off with touch of water cream I
was right it frickin love this thing
then to freeze boils my foundation I was
right once again it warm nude this
happens to be my shade thank God
next was tart shaped tape this is the
shade light/medium laura mercier that
was correct looks like I forgot to wipe
off my bake apparently that is just fine
and dandy not surprised we use Kelvin D
shade and light palette they'll be
pretty hard to freaking and miss this
one in my palette or considering it is
broken and open and barely existing
anymore for highlighter we did grab the
Anasazi I'm raised the highlighter it is
definitely looking blinding to say the
least
really love this super flattering
placement of all over my cheek that I
went with today okay let me know why
this eyebrow is low-key like kind of
good
this sister over here she's struggling
let's be real but this one over here
like she's doing it okay
so next is eyeshadow and we did end up
with the jocelyn help a lot thank God I
was right on that I ended up picking
okay yeah the transition shade which is
right here and then this shade right
here I think if I remember correctly
which is the shades that I wanted to go
with definitely not the half cut crease
that we were going for but doesn't look
that bad next was eyeliner which turned
out and trusting to say the least she
comes to a nice little point definitely
is a little bit wonky in this region it
definitely could be a little bit sharper
like ready to cut somebody but you know
why she's there she's a struggle wing
she's like flopping in the wind she's
like not like airborne yet but like
she's trying she's like the chicken of
the winged liner that was a horrible
joke also loved that I completely forgot
to do with lower lash line eye shadow
good job James I think the best result
out of the entire face though is the
lips like Hello look at these
they look so good I thought at one point
my lipstick slipped and I Overland way
too much but apparently I overlay my
lips a lot on a regular makeup basis
because these look pretty good I'm proud
of myself for that one that is for sure
not gonna lie I really did not have high
hopes for this challenge at all I think
this is kind of like the no mirror
makeup challenge and that you can't see
what you're doing at all but also I did
not pick up the makeup products prior
either so picking all these could have
really easily been a huge disaster but
that just tells me that I am way too
addicted to makeup and know way too much
about all the products that I use on an
everyday basis because I feel like I did
a very very good job of picking out
products that I would normally use
so I guess good job to myself for that
I definitely what you guys leave me
comment down below though tell me how
you think I did do you think you could
do this challenge how well do you really
know your makeup collection apparently I
know mine very very well this challenge
was so much fun to film but I will never
