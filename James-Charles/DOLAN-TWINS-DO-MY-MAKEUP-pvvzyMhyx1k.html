awaited after all my thirsty and serum
common side of Ethan a graceless wake up
for Halloween I was so excited they
turned out amazing if you guys saw on
our Instagram but now they invited me

ever been cleaned up before get glammed
down but we loved it we did we loved a
Glen make a true sister twin makeover

everyday makeup routine in front of both
Ethan and Grayson I have duplicates of
all of them except for a few items which
are in the middle and you guys will have
to share I'm gonna give even this side
my face and Grayson this side of my face
and they're gonna do their back wheel of
a race we do love a right side they're
gonna do the best to glam me up the
closest to what they think I normally
look like this is a competition - so at
the end you guys we love the competition

better half of the face yeah so so just
kind of an earring down iron at the
bottom I'm coming my name is I think I

out of the two of you guys if you were
taking us right now being completely
unbiased and putting your egos aside
like what I do you think is gonna look
right even has no idea what he's doing
with or no chill Kristin isn't even a
working camera and as we learned in our
video that is true you got him there and
he also can't read yes when I read the
products I'll know where they go he's
where they go the lipstick was one of
the last steps I believe I'm confused as
to what to do next
I think this lash oh wait that goes at
last also brow brows next boom pencil up
sure the birds make it look good it does
look good all right that looks like a
good eyebrow they need to squeeze a
little I do it I do oh don't you oh
let's not move you need to relax James
okay this eyelash is the plan perfectly
I'm gonna be so mad huh all right
Grayson the magic isn't the tweezers we
love highlight right sisters have you

that abstract eyebrow of course you are
I'm gonna bronze the shit out of you or
not all right now it's time for me to
curl your eyelash

type of makeup Oh what's the oh wow that
is highlight can you sing you the whole
thing oh and do some lip liner you're
gonna fill it in or no okay it's just
some drawing action here if you're
drawing a deck I swear to god no no no

the Instagram comment
this is easier than I thought oh yeah
I'm gonna take over your channel I think
you're saying honestly do little hombre
action Oh we'd love a girl bright dewy
me jo
that is a great hombre not even a good
one a great one a great one
I'm so bad at makeup well if you look at
without it I'm actually I'm great I'm
like a great abstract makeup artist I'm
gonna chisel this job that's what I'm
going for
Picasso is shaking I need the Dolan
jawline and - you use them I can't feel
that you flew my eyelid together today
really yeah and that's what you want
right big lips yeah okay cool oh there's
colors in it okay Kristen's are really
going to monarch come on it feels good
it kind of found a foot and I'm gonna do
a winged eyelash because that eyelash
dang I murdered that Oh setting spray
wait no this is not I'm setting it this
is the fight part I'm setting it first
no no I need a center it might seem to
mess up you wait oh my boyfriend's are
fighting over there actually is a little
bit more room for blending
oh my we're done we're finished three
two one okay go oh my god
I did it good wait both of you look like
the lashes literally perfectly really
yes we love a beauty guru I really
wanted to exaggerate the natural born
facial features that you had um so I
took your cheekbone and I put some
highlighter on it
so you let me get a little bit of shape
tape concealer on your highlighter today
what is this concealer usually goes
under your eyes uh but when I was
standing
okay so yeah makeup is definitely very
expensive so you're going for the budget
options maybe I was yeah one tonic for
many definitely how much I got done with
eyeliner I contoured your nose with some
eyeliner hi
we're going for the snaps look today yes
I wanted to make you look like a very
handsome you look beautiful get out of
here oh if he knows the ear I also
wanted to define a little bit more dark
don't be an era stop throwing at me and
then the little guy there's a guy on
your face yeah oh my god I didn't see
him there what's his name he just goes
by sister okay perfect I love that about
him uh-huh the lips I just try to do lip
liner I think you mess it up all right
enough of the bullshit the moment you've
all been waiting for
let's hop over to the left side this is
glam makeup at its best finest and
here's the rundown you know with the
highlighter I kind of took it all over
the face and I added it to the little
ear flap over here too because he needs
to look it doesn't look great
those fries I mean yours don't yeah my
contoured here big lips they're cool
yeah James likes big lips I knew that
about him they look big because I you
know took the lipstick and I went
outside his lips that is a key what is
that called lip plumping yeah sure hey
look at my eye shadow compared to
Ethan's this is full season collective
eyeshadow - you there - just you know
yours is like lettuce vibrant it is
bringing and it is amazing and I beg to
disown Ingres know you think I'm a bit
of makeup artist I beg today no no I
like me yeah please I'm attacking
I killed that wing and I love that about
me I just really got being TT I mean oh
so how do you vote who do you think did
better
I mean I just love both you guys so much
I think that they'll be it's not about
it's about the makeup well let's put it
this way if inside I would feel more
confident walking out with but I started
makeup before they are and you have to
appreciate the art you I feel like grace
