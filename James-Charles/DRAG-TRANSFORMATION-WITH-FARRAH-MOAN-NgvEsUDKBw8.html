technically oh yeah
everybody actually makes a little
mixture like I'm Ben Wyatt on earth
luxury banana powder and then sabor
Mercier powder a little bit of like
white powder and a little bit of powder
kind of it's like a little bit I'm going
to custom color
yeah that's a trick that I picked up
early on made my career so tell me was
like you know how hungry it was so weird
honestly like yeah let me did so when
you when I walked in the workroom I was
like I had I was going to say like hi
mom or something something like that but
all I could think was like oh my god
like this is what it looks like
it felt like I had jumped into my TV
screaming cousin Jim Johnson also
educated 11 how are they probably going
to see there because all those be on the
show I mean right now we're going to my
next step and I told James hoping I do

even though you are a powder with our
eyes yeah if your RFP on our beauty guru
and you to believe all you know this is
like rule number one that you never ever
apply well they've never said not to I
think they definitely have said that
Americans on there's nothing rule number
one you don't put those are creating
solar power plant but we do it all the
time week Laura brought down oh oh right
well I guess it obviously you do you so
this is the chart of marriage you
maracuja maracuja never ever say that
maracuja creaseless concealer i swear by
i know they have a new concealer out
that everyone's raving about I have a
try to get I'm sure all of it if I love
this one so much of that here we go
so how old you been in jail or I've been
doing drag for five years now and the
only is yeah I didn't figure so until
last year and January first compliment
yeah originally from Texas boring race
in Houston Texas course harrows world
Texas born and raised I said you know
what they a lot but I got my drag bar in
Austin Texas around 18 I think I need
cannon queen of scamming going to shock
right now
well just get your priests instant
before you put on your shadow rising
romance I was sketching out where your
eyebrows gonna go it does I'll highlight
whoa you know how to have a plan where
every well yeah yeah what's so cool I
was your source and then discuss how to
do off everyone is like dark kind of
that I am probably never like twins that
always like this very that's okay we
here in the Gymkhana we love the travel
I'm going to mix a little mixture in
where I'm going to actually do a little
bit of our original mixture but then put
more of the laura mercier and queen of
mixing I like to start with little tiny
amount of powder first and then
obviously build so it's like if you put
too much on
little Kraken be kinky in like ruling
today so fair as if you will know circle
taco on my brow bone too young and
relatively very dark and very very hairy
because you have rather than here's a
good little girl
all around you want the best coverage
possible focus salvaging a fantastic job
of adding a little extra light metal
better true leaking well how these are
doing the Thunder I live to love a white
concrete lid
this is the color pinch of peach I would
love a pink blush honestly truly I don't
like orange questions I don't like dark
I just pink blush is all in there
see I ever blush period ever ever so now
we're going to go on take on something
or field locate and glean we're going to
highlight him before we bake so Farrah
telly is obviously like well she's no
curtains or amateur Oh every single
fucking time what I wanted oh good thing
a lot to customer a little bit because I
am just loving vicious so we went in the
starburst first and now we're going to
go in the crush parole whoa whoa picnic
and evening
okay okay guys we're going to go to ijen
now we're going to my favorite I thought
above all time that you are actually all
over of - is that my favorite eyeshadow
I just go to shower all the time it's
sugar pill belly pop you're so strong I
admire you so much for being strong
through it thank you I have some day
journey my face day that like almost
kills me but looming in here thank dude
I have a very specific substance is
having fun and had got manipulated super
thick if we were getting audible I like
to sit back and look at situations do
Italian for all about yourself as a
person cause I don't have to always be
kind of got the upper - no time machines
yet and you can't take things back at
the moment well can do besides learning
to stutters awful situation you know
well yeah and a lot of people that want
criticize you right now honestly if they
the people dug up with based on where
they are talking about here at all
everyone is problematic well I think
everybody has that they know my life
today it would not publicize it's just
my realm ocular test like I don't know
they're going to have it
because I said and they were stupid
they're ruining right back I think the
way she's revealing judged on what I'm
thinking they said so long like anything
can happen to contain somebody would so
they have a part that could be you know
an operation for person who loves our
life speculate nobody should be judged
in what they said even like a year no
little foreigners in all the fact that
anything said before years ago good line
easy does it doesn't make it okay I
think nobody should be judged for what
they said so longer we go people change
and trust me a lot of people agree with
you on that
now that we finished the liner let's go
inning cut that creates a little bit of
the black eyeshadow yeah we had to move
positions because I could not get over
there and do it at the paintball it was
really hard okay now that I've been cut
ready to commit and we're going to
continue on I'm going to score on
dollars hopefully one just to get the
legend salvia fuck amenable Mars so I
will check with my father going to help
my god I mean honestly that's why I did
it
no right I'm using and so we're going to
actually go on to some jeffree star on
drug board I like to do this with like a
little white liner right there I never
actually tried this on the lip but I
love it a liner
I got this type of route guide you like
still nervous because you like the king
of Rob to be careful that's a great yet
yes honey then brow I love if I want to
clear all time like I wish that maybe
just one time in my life except the
Nashville eyebrow I feel glad your drive
I can like to play the face in the
cotton I think it's perceived abroad
really had a widely kind of eyebrow on
so you still in a very very straight
like you know arts kind of shaved like
SuperDuper thick looks very very hard to
make Limoges okay as a better brow but
it'll do
don't care if I did this off camera
because it's like the chance realtor I
know but they they can take it
rhetorically answered and you watch it
because we're going to get about
off-camera also tell you about the other
brow um like I said my brother never
symmetrical they're never even give me a
break I'm not like missing just happylab
okay they might look a little better
after I clean it up of this so this next
step of you I take it kind of like a
chill colored eyeshadow may also see
Beverly so this is a Ashdown I always
like to take this and this is kind of
where I put the hairs as well I think
that it's like first I like to line the
bottom of it okay we're going into some
benefit roller lash
see that's not so cool about these which
Atilla care is the paper look to turn on
everybody
so you little like doll like a little
bit like a little deer or something you
literally said oh yeah so where I would
like to
laughs is on and like go over one last
time with the liquid liner because
especially was like a white eyeshadow it
all fall and if I'm doing really a
strong ring the liquid liner the club
here's a crazy I'm so tight oh well I
like well I wouldn't pick the law brings
so much with me I would have my Beauty
Blender makes me choice and lastly so it
wouldn't be as pheromone but without the
little individual bottom lashes so we
