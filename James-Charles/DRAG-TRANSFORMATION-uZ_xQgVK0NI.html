welcome back to my youtube channel so
you may be wondering why my hair is not
styled and pooped up like normal and why
I'm wearing this very fancy wake up up
on my head today and for save today
we're going to doing a drag tutorial
I've only done draw graffiti on my
Instagram page but they've all been
looks at I've been super super proud of
and every time I do post one as well
literally all the comments are what are
you doing a video when are you filming a
video we want to know how to do this so
for today's video I sat down and I'm
going to teach you guys how to go from
dance so then I have a ton of products
here in front of me and ironically
enough most of them are actually part of
my everyday makeup routine dry makeup
doesn't have to be some crazy expensive
art you can totally use the products you
have at home just in a different style
that you might not think of obviously I
am NOT a dry clean you guys know I'm a
makeup artist and I definitely cannot
perform or dance on stage that is for
sure but 50% of drag is the whole
aesthetic behind edit is a very very
cool and beautiful art form so that
further if you would like to see it me
transform into a drag queen and just
test us on drag makeup today make sure
you keep on watching all right so some
Drive Queens have their eyebrows shaven
up but of course I have a very very
bushy brows so our first step today is
going to be to cover them up all you're
going to use the classic Elmer's glue
stick a spoolie and then a wet towel I'm
basically just taking my glue stick and
running this all throughout my eyebrows
and I'm going super hard as well I want
a ton of glue to get on there especially
for the first layer I'm gonna grab my
spoolie brush and I'm going to pull my
skin up and I'm just going to really
really roughly go through that brow and
brush all the hair upward it's really
importantly you do a good job spooling
through these and brushing them all the
way upwards flat to your face because
once you add a lot of layers of glue you
will be able to a powder in foundation
right over them and hopefully the goal
that's will obviously be that there is
no texture and you can't see them at all
so you really have to make sure that the
brow covering process is done it's super
super efficiently and then once it's all
come through I just wet the corner of
this towel and then I always like to go
around the hairs and just kind of wipe
away the extra of Gulu having the least
amount of glue possible the better but
obviously you need to cover them
depending on how thick your bronzer and
mine are super super thick so I always
like to wipe away the glue around the
edges so therefore the glue it's only on
the brow and not on the skin because
that creates unwanted texture later on
so by the time of this eyebrow
blew down and cleaned up this problems
how completely dry so we can go on to
the next layer so for this era once
again I'm going to grab my glue stick
and I'm just going to put on really
really hard onto the actual hair and I'm
going to make sure to really kind of dig
this into my forehead as well because
once you put the glue on this layer we
are going to spoolie through it because
that's just going to interrupt the layer
beforehand so from now on we're just
going to layer over top and then clean
it up and we're going to repeat this
exact process probably three or four
times and so we have four layers of glue
total and then we'll go on to the next
step alright so this is four layers of
glue completely packed on there and dry
and the next one's going to be to go in
with Cody err some powder and a powder
puff and pack those brows down I'm going
to be their powder puff and I'm going to
dip into quite a lot of powder just dust
the excess off cost a little bit because
we all know what this smells like and
then I'm going to pack it into my brows
I'm definitely not going to be worrying
about fallout because you can always
brush it away but basically this powder
is going to really set the brows in
place make sure this I flew is 100% set
and then also fill in any areas that
texture is still left which makes them
super super smooth and ready to cover
with foundation for foundation today I'm
going to be using my new favorite
crumble that I've been telling you guys
about and that is the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD and the Too Faced Born This Day
Foundation
I am in the shade Y at 325 in this one
and then natural beige in the Too Faced
one I'm just going to go in and I'm
going to go over the brows first and I'm
just going to press that foundation in
there pretty hard to really fill in all
the places and you see how that brow is
now completely covered in thought spooky
I'm actually gonna let this Foundation
start to set in place and dry down just
a little bit before I go into my full
face and while I do that I'm going to go
to my makeup ever pro sculpting palette
and I'm going to color crack just gonna
grab any normal packing brush and go
into this orange shade and then rub it
all over my beard area I definitely get
a pretty bad 5 o'clock shadow now that
I'm thinking about it I probably should
have color corrected my eyebrows to
being that they are blue toned hair just
like all hair and body is so it's pretty
doubled me but I guess we're just going
to color correct the beard and praises
the eyebrows get decent coverage
basically I want to put this consider
anywhere where I normally have darkness
or a body hair growing and I get a lot
of hair on my chin moustache area and
then in my sideburns and then I
definitely get a lot of darkness
underneath my eyes from barely sleeping
from editing all night long
basically the or zones of the concealer
are going to cancel out the blue tones
of the darkness which just furthers the
illusion ii feel is all in there and
blend it out i'm just going to go into
my makeup forever stick once again and
just cover over my entire face I'm
definitely putting a lot of this on and
going full coverage tonight this is
definitely not a natural everyday look
by any mean this is literally the most
horrifying look ever next I got to go to
my tart shave tape in the shade light
and just highlight my face like I said
we are not going for a natural look in
any meetings for today so I'm definitely
talking a lot of product on I know a lot
of drag queens like doing a cream
contouring for their makeup for me cream
contouring is just something that I'm
not really at the end of so I'm gonna be
doing all powder contouring today but
that is totally up to personal
preference you can do whatever you want
if you wanted to do cream contouring and
now would be the time to do it before we
get into powder in the next step and
then once again going to grab my Cody or
some powder and a powder puff and we're
going to pass the powder on today
flashback meri here we come I'm going to
sort by setting underneath my eyes you
can see we're going to get the most
amount of creases and then I'm going to
really talk to powder into my nose
because you're going to be contouring a
lot today
and I really want to make sure that
these foundation and concealer stay on
there and don't wear off same thing when
it comes to the eyebrows I'm just going
to be really really gentle as well
because we don't want to take off any of
that product that we already layer down
are also going to start peeking back
through to contour my face City I'm
going to use it shocking my Kat Von D
shade and light palette on videos I
wrote the M 405 brush and different to
the left and middle shades and they're
just going to go in and tail out my face
I usually contra for about here down to
the corner of my mouth but for actual
drag makeup I'm going to contour
starting at the top of my sideburn and
then I'm going to go and draw any like
more curved line kind of ending more up
here instead I'm just going to really
raise my cheekbones and give them more
of a feminine appearance obviously
there's no exact way to do drag you can
see your face however you want you can
contour however you want and I know
there's no exact male or female face
shapes that we need to follow I'm just
doing it based on these standards that
people usually do follow when it comes
to contouring to jawline then look to
the cheekbone I am going to do something
a little bit different to make
everything look more soft I'm actually
going to chisel out my jawline starting
up the corner here and kind of rounding
this out a little bit just again I say
some more stuff and once again feminine
appearance when a company knows contour
your sisters already know that I love a
good chiseled out pinched ass note so
for today's like I'm just going to do
the same exact thing it just a little
bit more intense
finally to finish off the base I'm just
going to go in with my benefit hoola
bronzer in my Murphy M 5 to 7 brush and
I'm just going to use this bronzer to
kind of blend together the contour and
highlight and make everything nice and
bronzed the Edit connected same exact
thing at Cody orthopod powder puff one
last time
you guys know that I stopped taking my
face in my normal makeup routine a very
very long time ago when I moved to
California I thought that it wasn't
really necessary anymore and I much
preferred the more glowy dewy foundation
look but when it comes to drag makeup
baking is absolutely necessary
it definitely locks the face in place
because these Queens that are doing this
makeup on a nightly basis are going to
be performing onstage under a whole lot
of lights and dancing and sweating so it
really make sure all the foundation
stays on and also using the translucent
powder intensifies all the highlights
that we use with our concealer earlier
which just makes the makeup have a lot
more dimension and just look better in
general
alright so brace yourself because the
drive brows are by far the most
complicated part of driving makeup and
even after doing look several several
times and being a professional makeup
artist it is still so hard for me to get
my brows perfect and symmetrical but
we're going to try of course so today
I'm gonna be using the benefit curb brow
gel and I'm using the shade at number
three to match my wig and then I'm just
going to use any old angle brush and
this is the makeup shocks t-55 okay so I
just remember little bit apart than my
inger brush and I'm just going to start
sketching them and so I'm basically
going to start my brow at the bottom of
my normal brow I want my new Brown to be
in the exact same starting position as
my old one so therefore they look
natural and I'm just going to draw them
a whole lot more arched than my normal
everyday brows and a little bit thinner
too
once I have the bottom line of the brow
all wind up I like to dance start at the
outside and make the tail then I always
like to throw that upper brow and right
about here and then just connect them
let's I have those brows all lined in
and pretty much filled up I like to take
just the side of the brush and go in and
start to pack that product forward to
create a natural ombre once their ombre
now I'm going to go back into the
original angle brush being the t-55 from
makeup shot as if it to this a dark
brown shade right up in here and just
create some brown strokes as always with
my normal brows are going to grab a
little bit more shaped teeth concealer
once again in the shade light and then
my morphe 43 brush and just clean them
up
any excess consider I'm just going to
prime and set my eyelids and get ready
for eyeshadow okay so now that the brows
are all complete you can take a major
deep breath because the rest is all
smooth sailing from here so far I
started like I said I'll be using the
Jaclyn hill pill and I'm going to start
off these in my makeup shock tea for
brush and dipping into this neutral tone
of brown shade right up in here and just
lightly dusting that in my crease I am
going to be cutting out my crease today
so I'm going to be putting this just
slightly above if you guys don't follow
me for a while you've probably seen all
the job looks that I've done there
really hasn't been and many of them in
the first place but I used to do a
really really really intense style of
Drive makeup that really was never
flattering to my face everyone would
always tweet them when I fucking posted
them saying I look like the dragon from
shrekt which yeah I'll give you that
they're definitely dead I originally
discovered a Brazilian drag queen who
ever named Pablo guitar that I am
literally obsessed with he is so pretty
he's also a musician so like a true
freaking sister his makeup is very very
unnatural and not very intense even for
being a drag queen so as soon as I saw
him I was so inspired to test this out
and as you guys follow me on South which
if you don't you definitely need to I
tried out this look a few nights ago and
everybody was kind of shook over I wish
took over I was so happy how it turned
out so I definitely wanted to tell me
tutorial for you guys I'm using a burnt
orange shade on my makeup Shack t-33
brush to blend out and deep into the
outer part of the crease now that same
exact brush I'm going to grab this
medium tone Brown up in here and then
deepen it out even more and I'm going to
take a quick break for my eye shadow for
a second and grab these steal out liquid
metals and this is in the shade of
kitten karma I'm just going to use this
to carve out my entire eyelid by going
slightly right above the crease I'm just
going to close my eyes and fan my eyes
to let this dry I have to be going back
in with more shadow and liquid liner in
a second and I don't want this glitter
to transfer anywhere to do any way
Atlantic's today I'm going to use my Wet
n Wild mega liner obviously in the shade
of black so basically for the wave liner
we're keeping the same technique as
normal just making it a whole lot bigger
and thicker
numbers and lighters all on Andrea I'm
going to go back in with my t-33 brush
one last time and actually dip into it
the black shade in the Jacqueline hood
palette and just darken out the outer
corners I'm blending this black bolt
into the crease add in to the glitter as
well for the lower lash line I'm going
to start off by lining my waterline
using my NYX epic wonder pencil then I'm
going to get my buffy r43 brush and dip
into this warm tone brown up in here and
start to define the lash line when I get
to this inner corner I'm actually not
going to follow my natural eye shape and
I'm going to make this kind of more a
straight line to create the effect of a
new inner corner then art students think
I bought the M for 33 bucks and
different to this warm tone of orange
here and just blend that out
lastly I'm going to actually use a
custom pair of stock lashes that I made
earlier on and that is a combination of
the makeup Shack matte eye lash and my
301 now normally I would use just a few
pairs of three or one stack which are
literally humongous as you can see
they're like a freaking butterfly wing
so this is a more toned down version of
drive these are the perfect combination
of lashing if you look closely as well
my lash in the inner corner is glued
down to the inner corner as it goes out
to the outer lash line and my lashes
actually glued nowhere near my lash line
it's probably actually a good half an
inch away from my outer corner and the
end of the lash is actually sitting in
the middle of the liner this looks
pretty weird close up and you definitely
don't have to do it by any means but
from far away gluing the lashes up more
just helps lift the entire face and
really gives you like a snatched look
that just looks so so good like I said
I'm just going to take my roller lash
mascara and just dip in a little bit and
I'm going to connect my regular lashes
with these huge ass fake ones
I'm sorry make sure the ones in the
outer course are very very coated and
nice and black so they blend into the
liner and the lashes because if there's
any powder on them like you can see
right now I'm really going to mess up
the illusion of having those lashes
glued why higher up if you do decide to
do that
for highlighters today of course will
also be used in the Anasazi of cell
Hollywood illuminator in my morphe M 501
brush Oh
pheromone is shaking are you kidding me
we've been baking for like an hour now
so I'm going to go ahead and wipe this
alight oh and see how that just made
that cut so nice oh yeah
using my Murphy M or 3:1 I'm also going
to highlight Lee nose you doesn't want
to be very very careful and highlighting
as well because a nose contort highway
can definitely make or break a drag look
and you definitely ought to be super
stache as possible so I'm also going to
have a flat top brush and I'm going to
highlight my brow bone today now this is
your first time doing draws I definitely
would not recommend doing this because
highlighting obviously adds and just a
texture to any area and if this is your
first time covering a brows unless you
are some miracle worker because or
notices me a whole lot of practice they
might look a little bit texture for the
first time it just takes a whole lot of
process but once you get really good at
covering your brows and they're nice and
flat like this one is even this one's a
little bit wonky but this one's nice and
flat see how about how they just looks
so good yeah for my lips today I'm going
to start off with the Mac lip pencil in
the shade whirl and just over line them
a lot
so we definitely went way over over the
overlining but that is definitely the
point giant makeup is super super over
accentuated and just big and beautiful
in general so I'm next in with the Oprah
style palette liquid lipstick and just
fill everything in for some nice juicy
full of schewe slip and last but
certainly not least I'm going to set my
face in place using my Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray alright guys so
that has to look all complete but we all
know the drag is a whole lot more than
just makeup so I'm going to go ahead and
change my also quickly upon the wake and
I'll be a right back with the finished
look alright guys so this is the no
makeup natural everyday woman tutorial
complete just kidding obviously this is
a very very full intense struggle and I
absolutely love how this turned out
as you guys saw I pretty much did use
all of my everyday makeup products that
I use in most of my looks there's been a
very different and more intense white
and this is the giant look we came up
with today if you guys did into this
