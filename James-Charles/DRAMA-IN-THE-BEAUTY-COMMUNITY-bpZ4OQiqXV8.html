welcome back to my youtube channel for
today's video I have something not gonna
lie a little bit less like implant I had
a concept for today's video all ready to
go ready to film I sat down and after a
further thought quickly realized it was
not the best idea since I'm an awful
youtuber and could not think of any
better ideas I'm gonna be reading this
makeup book that I did almost two years
ago now to date it is still when my
all-time favorite makeup books that I've
ever done but I feel like my skill level
has grown so much and I think I could
really improve this and make this a
really really awesome look not only mine
awful youtuber but I'm also unoriginal
and since last week's video was
recreating your guys's makeup looks and
today's videos recreate mine I can't use
recreating and my title twice in a row
that'll be really really stupid so I'm
gonna make this video also a Q&amp;amp;A so I
can make the tomato something different
love that I've always been K I've been
wanting to recreate this look for a
super super long time now but creative
looks don't really do that well on my
channel so this is the perfect excuse
for me to do a creative makeup look and
you guys have to watch got you good
without further ado I already have my
BAE's already on let's go ahead and get
started with some questions and some
cool lightning bolt makeups I'm gonna
start this book off by popping off my
eyelashes clearly I'm going to be doing
a lot of work on my face and eyes today
so cannot have any Miami's distracting
me from that process oh my god I just
lost that no we're good we found her she
shut off this lips today I'm gonna lay
down just a light base coat using my
morphe at 35 P palette and using the
blue shade or right in this corner the
first question today comes from sister
Alessandra and she says pineapple on
pizza yes or no absolutely not I
literally think pineapple pizza is one
of the grossest
combinations ever like who wants their
pizza to be sweet I know I certainly
know I personally am a pepperoni type
sister I love me some good pepperoni
pineapple absolutely not I'm your ask do
you want to stay in LA or do you plan to
move somewhere else in the future that's
actually a really good question that I
personally ask myself all the time
thinking in terms of right now I
definitely do plan on staying in LA for
quite a long time I really really like
it here I definitely like love the Sun
the warm weather all my really close
friends are here aside from my
family of course so I really like being
here and my job is here as well I feel
like I'm always getting a lot of work
done us for it downtown LA definitely
not
I plan on renewing my lease here for one
more year but after this year I'm gonna
save all my money and hopefully be able
to build my own house which is gonna be
such an amazing accomplishment at only
19 years old so fingers crossed that
that works out because that is something
that I'm really really looking forward
to but I guess I really never know what
the future holds like I said for right
now I'm happy but I definitely want to
explore a whole lot more and kind of see
my options and who knows where I'll be
five ten years from now so right now I'm
happy as a Nellie sister but maybe I'm
being and I don't recall one day
couldn't tell ya speaking of traveling
and exploring a new places sister ray
asked would you ever go on tour cuz I
want to meet you so bad that's a great
question sister right I don't know well
I can't believe my nose contour looked
so good today and Here I am packing dark
blue eyeshadow right over top of it and
ruining all the hard work I don't know
what I was gonna say that
kaitlin ass if you gotta marry the last
person that you kissed how would you
feel who died Oh awful oh no actually I
think I feel pretty good about that one
yeah I think I'd be okay with that
actually on second thought wrong person
sister Julia ass explain your love life
in one word intense my ass if you could
tell your younger self one thing what
would it be
shut up I really love this natural
everyday glam look that we have going on
right now
ah Briana asked who was telling that you
look up to I think that my answer would
actually be to people and that would be
Jaclyn hill and nikkietutorials I
remember watching Joslyn Halen wanting
to literally buy every single product
she ever put on her face because she
looked at that perfect and I were
watching Nikki and it's just really
bringing my true artist out in me I feel
like her looks were always so original
and so creative and I just really love
that about YouTube because do you guys
know that's really what got my start in
the makeup industry to begin with so I
really had to say Jacqueline or nifty
because they've been around for so long
and I think have generally worked so
hard for the platforms that they have
and truly do deserve it and use their
platforms for the best they possibly can
which makes me it really really hot
and makes me happy to call them role
models and also really close friends I'm
just gonna take the darker blue shade
and the darker blush lead to kind of
create some clouds and some more
dimension in the sky
I guess hello Sam asks if you could
change one thing about yourself what
would it be and why and I'd probably
have to say my hairline that's always
the first thing that I change on
facetune I wish it was just like a
little bit lower because sister always
has a lot on his mind he asked if you
could know one thing about your future
right now what would it be and why
good question probably what social media
point that I leave Thursday comments on
is finally gonna give in and marry me
yeah Kaitlyn asked if you were stranded
on a deserted island and you could
choose one youtuber to be sharing it
with you who would you pick and why I
think calling back to a few questions
ago I have to say it's sister Nikki once
again I feel like we'd be able to put
our creative minds together and figure
out some way of like living and
surviving also she's like super tall so
she could probably just reach for all
the coconuts in the tree that looks
pretty what is going on here hello
let me forgot how much I hate it working
a blue eyeshadow and look what I'm doing
cover my entire face with blue eyeshadow
makes me have facetune John asked what
do you think about any drama in the
beauty community I try not to think
about the beauty community Tommy asked
what is one thing you really want to
accomplish at the end of 2018 now in
search of this might be a little bit
cliche and it's kind of like a more
vague type of situation rather than like
one says the next thing but I want
everybody at the end it isn't a teen to
be able to look back on my year
including myself and just think oh my
god how did he do all of that that is
what I want for my year and I know that
sounds really really cliche but I just
want to get so much time to be working
all year round on so many different
projects so many cool opportunities
meeting you guys working on new works
launches working on new videos like
literally everything you can possibly
imagine I just want to do it I'm gonna
do it all sisters are gonna take over
the world
Kayla asked if there was gonna be a
movie made about your life who would you
want to play you
oh this is actually a really really good
question oh you know why I would pick I
would pick a sister Jake snatched by
Jake on Instagram who runs on my fan
page just he's literally so cute and I
feel like he's literally like that
meeting me we look alike and he does
makeup so he would definitely be a good
sister James I think I would trust him
to play me even though these are pretty
big shoes to fill
vivy asked what is your biggest fear hmm
probably a red socialblade just kidding
I am deathly afraid of heights and
snakes and bees and dying yeah all those
things Adrian said quick first one that
comes to mind sing it Oh baby don't say
the Turk with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass listening to our
favorite song when you said you looked
amiss and cheering sweetie I am so sorry
Stephanie asked what's one piece of
advice you have for someone looking to
start a career in the makeup industry
this is a question NTM that I get from
you guys literally all the time and I
think that the best answer I have for
you it would be to do something that
nobody else is doing don't do brown
smokey eyes don't do warm half-cut
creases and if you're gonna do those
paper looks and that's what you love
that's fine but just find some way to
make your own put your own spin on it
make videos with your personality
shining through it just do something
it's gonna set yourself apart because
there's a million one people trying to
do the same exact thing and nobody's
gonna make it with the same definitely
all seen a million times trust me on
that
and those I can barely breathe Christina
asked if you could design your own
escape room what would the theme be and
how intense would you make it if you
guys are part of the sister a snapchat
fan which if you were not go ad me right
up here and is a lint time there are all
sorts of rants fun activities singing
and of course sister escape room so you
guys know I do them all the time it is
literally my favorite pastime in the
entire world like if I find an escape
room one day that kills me I'll be dying
very very happy as crazy as that sounds
but I do think about this quite often as
bursting as that may seem one theme that
I would love to see in an escape it
would be like a log cabin type of
situation like in the snowy hills or
something and you only have an hour to
escape or else like the abominable
snowman or something comes to get you we
can work on that part of the concept
have really thought that's fully through
but you guys are I definitely love a
really really intense once I think it'd
be so cool to have all different sorts
of rooms but I think the one really cool
aspect of it since I'd be in the snow
would be really cool if the room got
colder as the hour progressed and by the
time like the last few minutes are going
and be like freezing cold I don't think
that'd be such a cool out of concept to
add it to the already challenging escape
room let me know what you guys think if
you were to design an escape room what
would it be
leave a comment down below am i bleeding
oh that's a mole I'm gonna try to bring
up some of the darkness and his eye up
to the contouring areas and kind of
connect and blend them together to
distract from the poor blending going on
in this region oh that's so pretty
Alex asked Coke or Pepsi Pepsi
hands-down Pepsi is so much better even
though they've had quite the problematic
past so by let me tell you nothing makes
me happier in the entire world than when
I am at a restaurant and someone says
what do you want to drink and I'm like
oh I want a coke
I let me say coke is still really good
to it at this point it served at most
locations so I just gotten used to
saying coke but nothing makes me happier
than when someone says always perhaps
you okay yes girl yes Pepsi is more than
okay god bless you thank you so much for
that if you like coke that is okay if
you like Pepsi that's okay as long as
you acknowledge that there was a
difference between them because if you
think that they are the same thing we
have a problem
Anna said who was one non beauty
youtuber that you would really love to
collab with this question I think is
really really easy I think my answer
hands down would either be Shane Dawson
or jenna Marbles their content is so
funny and they both been around for so
long but continue to make me laugh
every single time they upload a video I
just think they are so creative and just
really like killing the game
to them forever I've met both of them so
yeah definitely love to do a video with
all of them kay asked when can we get
more of the sisters merge I really want
to get the sisters barber talking uh
yeah yeah thank you Kay for always
supporting that means of the world to me
I've actually been getting a lot of
questions about system paralleled in the
past a few days and for those of you
guys who haven't noticed don't really
know why you would this is to prepare
website husband down for the past few
weeks this is apparel was a first-ever
polling line that I've done obviously I
have no experience in that field
whatsoever and I will be open and honest
and saying that it was definitely not
the smoothest processes there were
definitely a lot of problems when I came
to like production and shipping and
obviously that's not something I want to
put my name on to so we just ended the
process of switching companies and just
making sure our production techniques
are the best they can possibly be in
order to get you guys looking at the
cutest you possibly can way way smoother
Jen said if for some reason you couldn't
do makeup anymore what career would you
choose oh and since I know you'd
probably say singer you can't choose
that either I mean like normal nine to
five job damn she got me there I feel
like if I wasn't able to do makeup or
sing I probably doing something
involving like numbers and technology in
high school my favorite subject was
actually math which I feel like it's
like breaking the internet kid law
because I feel like every social media
influencers like I hate math I was so
bad at it but I really could probably be
in accounting because that mixes
together like numbers and technology and
math and money which I love or also
stocks because that combines all those
things that plus strategy which you guys
know that I love probably sucks
I feel like that'd be fun Phoenix R Us
will this be the last question of the
video yes we're done all right sisters
and that is this lightning a recreation
look o complete I am so happy to have
this turned on I just feel like it looks
so electric and bright and beautiful
comparing this one to the original look
this one is way away way better like I
said the original photo was posted in
2016 it's one of the first looks that I
ever did it was right at the beginning
of my makeup career and you could
definitely see how much my skills have
improved since then obviously they are
very very similar concepts but the
contours are definitely intensified a
lot more oh thank god
there's a lot more dimension a lot more
glow a lot more highlights and I'd like
my line work is just a lot cleaner we
added
look we have some lashes on I'm just
really happy with how this turned out
and I really hope you guys enjoyed it as
well
I also hope you guys enjoyed learning a
little bit more about me and this Q&amp;amp;A
like I said this was definitely an
excuse to do this makeup book today and
I needed something to fill over top of
it I feel like you guys know literally
