Talkin' in my sleep at night
Makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind)
(Out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin'
it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)
My love, he makes me
feel like nobody else
Nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
One: don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way to turn)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)
But my love
he doesn't love me
so I tell myself
(tell myself) I tell myself I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know hes only calling cause he's
Drunk and alone
Two
Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three
Don't be his friend you know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if u run to him you ain't getting over him
I got new rules I count them
I got new rules I count them
I've got to tell them to myself
I've got to tell them to myself
Practice makes pefect, I'm still tryna learn it by heart
I got new rules
I got new rules
Eat, sleep, and breathe it Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause i
I got new rules i count them, I got new rules
One: Don't pick up the phone, cause you know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in, You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend you know youre gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
and if you're under him you know you ain't getting over him
