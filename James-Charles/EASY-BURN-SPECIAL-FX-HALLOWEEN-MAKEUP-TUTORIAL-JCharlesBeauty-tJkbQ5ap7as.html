to my youtube channel I'll be October
everybody it is officially the best
month out of the entire year I am so
very excited for October and for it to
be Halloween wow I cannot wait for all
the amazing makeup looks and the amazing
costumes we're going to be seeing so in
honor of this being my first Halloween
on YouTube I thought I should really go
all out and do the best that I possibly
can so I'm going to try key word trying
to do any Halloween makeup tutorials for
you guys holy crap I'm already
overwhelmed but I'm going to try it the
hardest I possibly can to get them out
because I want you guys to have the best
makeup and costume on the block so to
kick off this month of Halloween
throughout I decided to start off with
this half glam half burnt face makeup
it's the first time I've ever done
special-effects makeup but it was
honestly much easier than I was
expecting and it's all using something
you can find at your local Halloween
stores or in your makeup drawer so I
think you'll all be able to recreate it
easily and I'm honestly really proud of
how it turned out so if you want to
learn how to created this super crazy
Halloween makeup make sure you keep on
watching hi guys so today I figured I'd
do a voiceover for today's video in
order to just get it done and make it
the best it could possibly be so I could
really focus on the makeup senses my
first time like I said with special
effects I'm starting off by priming
using my benefit Porefessional and then
I'm just going right into the Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD foundation stick I'm
only applying both products on the one
half of my face that I'm going to be
doing the full glam on obviously the
other half is going to be completely
covered so I'm not really worrying about
it and then I'm just going to buff it
out using my morphe m4 3:9 foundation
brush you guys know this is my favorite
brush ever for foundation and you can
use code James for 10% off all morphe
brushes and products I would 100%
definitely recommend them to you guys
I'm then gonna go and you can see with
my la girl Pro concealer in the shade at
porcelain this is just the lightest
shade and I'm just highlighting the high
points once again not only the one half
of my face and then I'm just going to go
into my beauty blender to blend
everything out and make it really nice
and seamless because we want that full
glam today does that my face and going
into my morphe are three brush and my
Mac Studio Fix foundation powder this is
a new step I just recently added to my
routine but I've absolutely been loving
this lately it is the first Mac product
I've kind of ever tried but I really
really do like and it has completely
saved the life of my under-eye
and my nose contour so I would
definitely recommend to you guys
I'm not bronzing my face using my morphe
M five to seven brush and my Kat Von D
shade and light palette this is the best
big bronzer brush out there wow that's a
mouthful but I like that one as well to
set under my contour i'm using my morphe
r 8 and some cody airspun this is just
ensure that my contour is super sharp
and nice and defined to contour my nose
I'm using my JT weighty nose contouring
brush do you guys know if you follow me
on Twitter that I have been dying to get
this I accidentally took it from my
friend at generation Beauty New York but
I'm not sorry I turn off my brows I'm
using my benefit broad brush and just
spooling the hairs out to make sure they
get in the place that I want them to and
then I'm just going to benefit Cobra gel
in the shade number 5 to start sketching
them out I'm just drawing the line on
the bottom of the brow I'm going in kind
of Esley because we're going to be
cleaning it up in a second anyway but
I'm just defining that bottom line and
then starting to kind of fill in the
tail and the middle of the brow making
sure it is very very on fleek and then
with whatever product is left over I'm
just bringing that to it the front of
the brow and drawing a little flippity
doo-dah stew kind of have that Instagram
ombre brow that we all know and love to
clean up my brows I'm using my la girl
Pro concealer again and this random flat
top brush I can't find my morphe M 410
anywhere so I'm just using this one for
the time being it works equally as well
and then I'm using the same concealer
once again to prime the eyelid and then
just setting that in place with my
morphe e 45 and some Cody airspun and
then to finish off the brow region I'm
just going to Maya gimme brow gel in the
shade number 5 once again to set those
front hairs in place for the eyes today
I'm going to use my morphe 35o palette
if you haven't heard of this get out of
the rock even living under I promise the
real world is a good time this is one of
my all-time favorite palettes it is
beautiful and warm it is perfect for
fall and you can use code James for
money off I would definitely recommend
if you haven't checked it out I'm just
using my m4 3-3 brush and some orange
shades to build up the crease in the
outer corner I forgot to film a product
shot of the palette so I can't show you
guys what colors I was using sorry I
would definitely make sure to do that
for the next video but any transitional
orange shades will work and then I'm
just using my m56 to brush in a little
bit of a darker Brown to enhance the
crease and the lower lash line to give
it a little bit more
or defining darkness and depth to the
smoky eye we have going on and then to
finish off the Julie simple ayah I'm
just going to that shimmer shade from
the palette and a random once again
concealer brush that I don't know where
it's from for my waiting today I'm using
my Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper
this is my favorite liner ever it is so
good and the tip is super small I
actually ended up messing up my eyeliner
a lot of times today I don't know really
what was going on but let's be real we
all have those days the liner cap
getting thicker and longer until it was
like a good wing but I do end up liking
how it turned out in the end so I guess
the moral of the story is don't give up
if something isn't going your way or
it's really just like with Lana it's not
that serious James anyways I'm just
going with the Sigma brow hyland pencil
to line my waterline to give it a nice
pop and to open my eyes and then to
finish off the eyes I'm curling my
lashes with this rain I'm a CVS lash
curler it doesn't have any specific
brand and then it's going in and lifting
my lashes nice and high with my benefit
roller lash I love this mascara as you
guys know I never stop talking about it
which probably gets pretty annoying but
it's literally the only one I use so
might as well just be honest with you
guys and tell you how annoying I am when
it comes to switching products for
lashes today I decided to pop on a lena
lash in the style Serena I'm only
applying one last chance the other half
it's going to be covered once again but
I'm just using some duo and some
tweezers to get that on there to add
some glow I'm using my morphe M 501
brush in my Anasazi illuminator in it so
Hollywood this is like my favorite
highlighter ever and it is coming back
which I'm so excited about so if you've
been dying to get your hands on it your
time will be soon so definitely keep
your eyes peeled and then to finish off
this glam half of this look I'm using my
over liquid lipstick in the shade has
Dina you can use code J Chara for 30%
off and over does have my favorite
liquid lipstick formula so if you
haven't checked them out you definitely
should and that completes the glam half
of this makeup tutorial it's a nice and
simple look you could totally just end
it here if you wanted to just be pretty
for Halloween but we're gonna be gory
and oh my god I forgot how many freaking
times I messed up my stupid little
spinny thing but let's get started now
so I'm starting off this Gore side by
covering my entire brow using some
vaseline or some petroleum jelly liquid
latex can pull it hairs and
going to be using a lot of it so it's
really important that you create that
barrier so you don't rip out and give
yourself a whack job
all your little hairs on your face and
especially if you're like me and your
guy this is really important so I'm just
going in with some liquid latex right
from the little tube and I'm going right
around my eyebrow I'm going to cover
that first just to get out of the way so
I'm just putting a good amount around
the brow and then starting off with a
ripped tissue and just slapping it on
there we're going to be using tissues
latex and cotton balls to achieve the
burnt effect today so I'm just putting
on some latex putting on the rip tissue
and then going back over the edges of
the tissue with more liquid latex to
kind of seal it in place this definitely
just takes a lot of like practicing and
just kind of getting your method going
it definitely got easier as I went along
but it was pretty strange just to like
glue it things onto my face when I was
starting off but it turned out pretty
well so definitely just try to figure
out the best way that works for you I
just kept blaring latex and then tissues
and then latex and then tissues and
that's kind of what worked best one
thing I figured out was make sure using
a lot of latex when you go back over
your layers like I am right now a lot of
times if you didn't use a lot you could
pull up the tissue like it is right here
so you really want to make sure using a
lot of latex to kind of like really set
that in place and make sure that it is
stuck so I also use cotton balls to add
some texture it was definitely
recommended on a lot of the special
effects tutorials I was watching my
cotton balls were kind of disintegrating
instead of like pulling apart nicely so
I only ended up using a few of them
which sucked but I just made it work
with the tissue so definitely experiment
and see what works best for you to add
some texture
I know glam and gore Mikey said you
could use some groan coffee beans and
yeah I just read it what works best once
you have your latex all on there in a
position you like I started talking and
kind of pulling at the latex with
tweezer just to add some more texture to
start off the paint job I'm using this
random highlighting brush from I think
it's gy and eye makeup forever
flash palette in obviously the red shade
and I'm just going over that entire side
of the liquid latex with the red I made
sure to powder the liquid latex too with
my setting powder but I'm just giving a
nice base coat and then I am stippling
the edges to make sure it's kind of
blended out and it kind of evenly
transitions between the
two sides to add some more dimension I
use that same brush and mix together the
black and brown shades around the eyes
nose and the corner of the mouth to
really make it look like I am charred
and was burnt to the crisp and of course
I had to kind of contour a little bit
with some black so I'm just using the
black on my jaw line as well as my
contour line just to make it look like I
have some sort of defining features
underneath my third-degree burns and I
really wanted to add one final layer of
dimension because I felt like the look
wasn't missing something my friend Alex
Faction taught me this awesome trick if
you don't have fake blood you can
totally use lip gloss that's probably
laying around your makeup drawer so I
you just use a bunch of different dark
reds but the main one I use was the
morphe gloss in villain and I felt like
it really just pulled everything
together and really does look like fake
blood and really made the burn come to
life
alright guys a complete says how glam
half burnt face makeup girl I really
really hope you enjoyed this video this
is my person ever using special effects
makeup with like liquid latex in the
whole shebang I'm honestly pretty proud
