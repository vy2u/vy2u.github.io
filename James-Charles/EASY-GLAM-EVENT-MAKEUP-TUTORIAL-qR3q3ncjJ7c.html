welcome back to my youtube channel so if

Los Angeles I did graduate early I am
all done with high school
thank God and I just got approved my
first ever apartment oh my god I am so
freaking excited and I moved to LA in
the beginning of March where I get to
move into my dream house however I do go

I'm actually going to South Africa with
my friends for my senior trip of school
I'm so freaking excited and you guys
know that vlog will be freaking amazing
so make sure you keep your eyes peeled
after Africa I'll be heading to Boston
for a few days for a press play and it's
like a meet and greet show and concert I
will be performing live for the first
time so I am so freaking nervous you
guys wanna come say hi dueling for
tickets will be down below I really want
to come meet you guys because I am
leaving so soon however I've been having
so many events and photoshoots recently
I've living how to makeup on almost
every single day for the past two weeks
my skin it needs a break but we've got
to get that work done last night I was a
super simple but super beautiful glowy a
bronzy makeup look to a Dior event and a
ton of you guys are asking for it so I
decided to sit down tinsel maternal on
it today this is basically like my go-to
event makeup and I decided to do this
simple hoskin creates with little
diamonds on the side and just a nude lip
with lots of glow and if you guys want
to see how to create this look make sure
you keep on watching already hello
scissors so this was videos today I have
my base and eyebrows already done you
all have seen me do them a million times
and I'll be doing an update abroad
routine soon so keep your eyes peeled I
thought we just like focus on the eyes
and everything else today and make this
a super quick and easy tutorial I'm
going to start off the isolate with my
morphe 25b palette this is one of the
new mini pellets I guess it's not
actually that many it's still pretty big
but I'm gonna be using this one today
love's good description from first
connect one with this orange transition
shade up in here with my m4 for one and
just pop that into the crease next time
I got my m4 33 and dipped into this
ready brown shade up in here and just
put that on the outer V I'm just
blending this really lightly into the
outer crease I don't want this I love to
have too much dimension I'm kind of
keeping it really soft and light today
we still doesn't want to make sure it's
blended oh so I'm really making sure to
go in with those colors and blow them
out if you guys notice my hoodie does
say I'm shook I just released my first
ever clothing line called sisters
apparel I am so proud of that I've been
working on it for a very very long time
and we just have to launch a few days
ago you guys literally crashed the
website the entire server wasn't just my
store was the entire server which is so
fricking cool I mean like sorry it was
annoying for you guys but it was cool
for me that you guys have that much
power like crash entire server so it's
like a bittersweet type moment but it
should all be working now and a ton of
you guys have been tweeting me and
dealing me saying you got your stuff so
I'm so excited for you all to get
everything and look so cute definitely
check out the website it'll be below and
I can't wait to see all these sisters
rocking it not trying to go back in
without em 4 3 3 and I'm going to dip
into this dark brown shade right down
here and just sweep it up that other
corner for slightest bit for the liste
I'm going to have Miami one seven zero
zero and get into this shade right here
and sort of cut the crease I'm just
using this brush in the shadow to cut
out the inner corner and just going
about halfway there's basically going to
be a half crease and then I'm just going
to blend out the outer corner with the
same orange shadow from before for a
little bit more dimension I'm going to
layer over top of that shadow with the
new color pop single shadow in the shade
liar liar
I'm asking the same exact brush I have
not used any of these shadow kit so I'm
super excited to see how it looks on the
eye oh wow that's oh my god aha these
are really really pretty okay I'm
actually loving how the shadow is
applying this looks so beautiful these
channels are definitely a win and
they've been sitting in my drawer for
the Catholic
three weeks now i just opened the pr
package and now i'm really really mad
that i have not played with these tuner
i'm going to go in and out a winged
liner and for this i'm going to use my
absolute fave the Kat Von D tattoo liner
in the shade trooper will hopelessly
because this is some serious action
about to go down
how the prayer works because I think
this is literally one of the best ones
when I said I've ever done I'm shocked
well Anna has always been saying this
really hurts me because my eye shape and
because of my eyelid and my eyebrows
being so thick and not arch so I've
always had like John relating to really
really won't like out towards my temple
but recently I was like kind of in
figuring out a little bit how to draw
them upwards and not have them look
stupid so this is progress I'm happy but
the lower left side I'm going to go to
my M for 33 and that same original
orange transition shade and just our
Tabitha and I'm only going to keep this
color on the outer corner and then
taking the m56 to I'm going to take the
dark brown shade from before and just
cut the outer corner up to the wing I
just want to have in line my upper
waterline using my NYX jumbo eye pencil
in the shade of black bean that's
literally Miley Cirus half of my entire
makeup routine it always goes wrong and
I can never do it on camera so yeah do
that with whatever pencil you want patty
to learn my lower waterline and open up
my eyes I'm going to be using the Tarte
fake awake by pencil I've been loving
using it nude pencils in the waterline
light leaks black obviously close your
eyes and makes them look really sexy and
sultry and then white can be sometimes
too much in like to draggy so nude is
always like the perfect in-between that
goes without saying
just want to tell you know there's been
a PSA thanks for listening for my lower
lash out and take my tweezers and pick
up one of these little crystals and a
little bit of lash glue and just pop it
on right in the center this is obviously
a hundred percent unnecessary but it's
super duper cute and this look is very
very simple so I just wanted to pull a
lip
a little bit more attention to the eye
class today are going to popping on the
hot flashes iconic right after I pick up
the crust igloo cement from wearing last
night I know what I saw this in last
video but guys seriously putting on your
lashes before you put on mascara is the
best trick to anybody has ever taught me
15 out of 10 would definitely recommend
like made my life a million times easier
all right I just have done semester and
then curled eyelashes together to make
sure they are nice and blended and that
is what I all complete I'm going to go
in to do an off-camera to save some time
but we can come back and finish the rest
of the face there we go both eyes are
now complete so now we're going to move
on and we're going to get the glow on
for how did you say I'm going to using
my current babe the Oprah bliss little
highlighter and you can use code James
for it's already percent off I'm going
to apply this to it my brow bone first
using a pencil brush I'm going to pop
the same highlighter in the inner corner
I'm going to use that same brush to
snatch my nose
oh yeah come on pinch no love not being
able to breathe then of course sitting
right on 501 I'm also gonna pop the
pilot onto the cheekbone okay hi like
are we blind yes I love this highlighter
so much it's so freakin bomb it's like I
love it because it's like almost like a
natural glow and I know that sounds a
complete to say because it's
literally rubbing a shimmery glitter on
your face but so many
Highlanders either like two yellow toned
or two silver where they just look
strange when white isn't hitting it this
is like the only one that I've been able
to find that literally looks good at all
times so definitely would recommend if
you haven't checked it out all coupon
codes aside it's really really bomb for
list today I'm going to mix these two
shades together from morphe and the
shapes virgin and suspect okay I've been
wearing these lipsticks for a few weeks
now and a bunch of you guys in asking
for my opinion so here it is the
lipsticks from morphe are super good but
they aren't my favorite they retail for
$30 each and with a code it's like 11:50
that price is so good especially for all
of these guys out there on a budget
I know makeup can be so crazy expensive
they are super long wearing and there's
a ton of color selection so I think that
I do not love about them is that they
are really really drying I haven't super
drying coffee looks naturally are
through lip scrub all the time and I
would literally sit there with a pair of
tweezers and pick off the dead skin I
know it's gross but I'm being honest
with you guys these do dry a little bit
more than I like them to and they do
sell into my cracks but that's because I
have a lot of cracks in them to settle
into for me personally I like more of a
liquefied formula that I may have to
reapply it but I know most of you guys
love the drawing long-wearing formula so
if you're like me just put a bomb
underneath and you'll be a-okay all
right guys and this is the completed
look for today like I said super easy
glam that I've been wearing to a ton of
parties recently I decided to pop on
these gems because they're cute AF let
me know what you think in the comments
