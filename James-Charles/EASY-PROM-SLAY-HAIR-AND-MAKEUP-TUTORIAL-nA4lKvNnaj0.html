to my youtube channel today i think at
the other day a very very special guest
and one of the og sisters my best friend
in the entire world
Saburo since it is the beginning of that
that means prom season is here I am so
excited to see all my beautiful friends
going to prom
I remember last year for me prom with
one of the most magical experiences of
my entire life I know it's like a dream
for everybody so for today's video I
joined up with such a low of course but
also with Ada hair NYC but mostly guys
who Deauville before I actually did
makeup or ever even try and make up in
the first days I didn't used to do hair
styling and that was my big passion and
job for good like two or three years
before I ever picked up a foundation or
blending rush or anything of the sort
I was holding hairspray repelling lots
and lots of cones and a bobby pin it has
been a good as two or three years since
I've actually picked up a hair styling
tool so it was so fun and crazy
screeches look I'm honestly so shot that
I still have it and week I created just
like braided updo situation on sister
Laura I'm really proud of how it turns
out we even have her extensions hidden
which is a very very very hard taste to
see what it goes to hair styling so
we're super one of hundreds turned out
and I also created this makeup look -
it's very very light airy doing with the
specific Papa Gator on the light
perfect for prom and we favorite prom
makeup to cleanse be super super glam
which is like the best version of
yourself and even less be photographing
well no flashback Mary situation and
just a whole lot of like beautiful fun
pictures with all your good friends on
this very special and magical night that
being said it's going to be a crazy
combination tutorial all in one I'm
gonna show you guys how to sequence
hairstyle first and we're going to go
right into this super easy makeup look
so if you wanted to see how you treated
both of these look make sure you do it
with me she bought a latte
alright guys so we're starting off the
board they're already pre-washed off
cameras in the clean it up shampoo and
soften up conditioner we then went to
the therapy session hair masks which are
all scientifically proven to strengthen
hair we did this off-camera or a little
be sitting here for like fifty four
hours and then
in Maine magic time in one of primer
we're going to using a whole lot of
products today so I'm just going to
spread this all over the hair to make
sure it is really locked in place and
ready to go for styling and all that
sorts of stuff I better this Fiorella
just to prep the tips and middle of the
hair to protect from heat because
obviously very using a lot of tools like
wilderness training and curling one they
wanna make sure the hair is very very
safe and protected because yeah we don't
want it to die and fry off and you're
going to go to the peridot is dry
Laura's hair because it is still wet we
did it just also a few minutes
theoretically if the hair makes we dryer
for it to be its own Sun dusting in the
Paragard and a flat brush just to one
big brush through the hair on hair dryer
so it straightens at the same time and
then we're going to go to the
straightening iron as well just to go
over all Lauren's hair to make sure it
is SuperDuper straight and tempura plan
I'm just going to take a small little
sections as always and just straighten
here all the way around including leafy
frizzy part in the front because Laura
does have extensions in her hair so for
the most of the expenses our shape or
her normal hair is not straight we need
to make sure they are really really
blended together so begin at the curly
possible going to section uploads kara
and put it right in half down the town
of because that was enough for some
reason and then I'm going to be Ava NYC
a texturizing say this is really going
to help to silent hair and make sure it
is super super locked in place and ready
to go and also provides a lot of volume
and then goes its color well and I'm
going to just begin curling all of
Lauren's hair I'm going to just wrap the
hair around and small sections and then
once I tell is done I'm going to hold it
in my hand just to make sure it is
really really locked in place before I
let it out just like that I'm going to
go up around and call all born Paris's
is ever going to take a little bit of
time but I went ahead and I set up the
process and kind of do you guys good to
be sitting here for 16 hours only crawl
for sure but yeah I'm just going to curl
it all into this sections I'm also
searching up the direction as well so
they all don't look very very unifying
redevelopments really all super try to
bring that curls but they are going to
start off a little type we're going to
brush them through later on and they're
going to loosen up and look much more
better
a lot more like natural and I'm not
warned that of the look we're going for
tonight and that'll be perfect for
styling the updo coming in a few
sections I went ahead and I sent down
the top of Laura's hair which as you can
see it's very very frizzy and maybe let
everything before she does have
extensions so I'm not spring to go ahead
and I'm going to curl the top sections
as well making sure they blend well
together with the bottom portion and
then I'm just going to brush everything
together
next when I start doing this tiny little
braid on Laurens hair she does have a
side part not a middle parts on starting
this on the lower of the two parts if
that makes any sense at all I'm just
starting by doing a normal braid with
three strands that I'm adding hair as I
go over the middle strand I think this
is pretty hard to explain I've never
actually done a hair video before so if
you guys wanted to do more I can
definitely try to like get better at
angles or like explaining exhibiting
I've been doing this for years now so
just kind of come first hand to me but I
am straight a normal braid and adding
spectrum in very very tiny so it faces
small little braided subset and when I
said Lord up to extension so when I add
a big tiny section panel displayed to
the head I'm being very very strategic
in large places to facials extension
seats are very very well hidden
whatever all that I'm just finishing off
and break off the back of the hair and
then I'm going to go ahead and go to a
pancake the braid this is the techniques
I learned from a cute girls hairstyles
here on YouTube they are an amazing
channel but I'm just taking there and
I'm like this pulling out the size of
the strand just makes the brain have a
lot more volume and kind of make it look
like after lesson kind of like lift and
now I'm going to fake this own like poop
on the top this is often it a lot of
wedding hair cells I'm going to add it
for yourself today but I didn't really
don't want to do a lot of TV because
those extensions make that very very far
from taking the suction from the crown
of the head and tying it off into a high
pony and then I'm going to describe some
bobby pins and I'm going to push that
ponytail upwards creating a little hoop
in the back and I'm going to connect in
place I use like four or five dollar to
make sure it's really really lost in
there but by having this hair tie there
it does allow us to course upcoming tail
up creating that so without having to
use like fifty-four million pounds of
hairspray and bobby pins am i growing
air not leaving out small sections on
the left and right sides
but seeing a large chunk of curls from
the middle and I'm going to tie these
together this is all my favorite checks
to do it very very super quick up dude
I can pull me up these together like 30
or 40 minutes when sometimes it takes up
to like an hour or two hours depending
on little problem place so I did with
grab together the biggest chance of
curls into a ponytail and I'm just
pinning those little sections to the
back of Laura's head it's kind of hard
to explain but just watch as I go and
now I'm taking sections on the left and
right sides as well just swimming them
in little curl you little way with
independence to the size of the head
this creates the effect as if I lived
out there and each curl to the head when
in reality we just created them into a
big little like big curly fun but a
freaking Sigma factor that looks equally
as beautiful and it saves you so much
time
like I said before on this planner with
different areas different seasons
instead of just playing on the para see
where I was going to show that kind of B
I decided to technically left and right
I see them to them underneath the hair
just to kind of give the pot a little
bit more shape and volume desperation
but nothing was I really flying around
and this kind of locks it in place and
with that access hair I'm just going to
pin out I face right up to the fly yeah
endeavour is again then a finish to
alter the center grabs a great antenna
right over the top of the bun and just
lock it in place be 10mil access and
light as well and that is the completed
updo and I'm just going to finish off my
lip injection - - laughing Anna right
now we're going to talk with the Lord to
make up for today for her foundation I
went into the Urban Decay all nighter
this is Laura's pret favorite foundation
that she absolutely loves it and it just
like the name says this is for prom
obviously do want to be wearing it all
day long and we want to laugh to all the
dancing and getting hung on the dips or
I'm hopefully making out without zombie
so yeah it's a great foundation or
concealer can't leave me at heart shape
to concealer these are those this is my
all-time favorite north as well
I definitely not have done this or
disagreements in the high points of the
face and I'm just going to blend it out
really really quickly you think my
Beauty Blender I know going through this
is super super fast but there's a lot of
law in this tutorial it is two parts
like I said before so if it looks like a
normal time Italy to be here for 54
hours so I really hope you guys are like
understanding what's going on and then
I'm going to that Laura space in place
using the arcane rant and know
tada I've never actually tried this
table tonight for some using it's a bug
or loves and Mecca management to me and
I love it as well now I definitely would
be a buy myself a bottle and trying it
out for sure I just don't have my bronze
low safety the hoola bronzer isn't both
of our all-time favorite founders and it
works very very well people from our
skin tone so miserably bonding at my
face lightly I don't want to really be
doing a lot of a complan and then going
in with a Beauty Blender once again
similar that our theme annual photo
powder just to lightly face Laura's face
underneath those highlighted area so
this lock everything in for brows today
i meet been a consistent eyebrow pencil
in the shade number four iPods out of
focus
I'm not really sure why for something -
the problem is my face which is other
than not the focus of this video
well I've sized out on this lightly
building in kind of eyebrows and then of
course with an angle brush and some more
safety concealer just to clean them up
and shape them but they're all filled in
and mock data so I started thinking a
modern I'd help out number convert
orange shade on my Murphy M 4-3-3 bus
under figuring a really light kilo I I
just picked up this orange shade once
again that's a dress I'm going to be
doing that in the outer and inner
corners and this might be a flaming
backpack that I'm going to go into the
shade of a mirror on this white cloth
possession to practice in to the very
very center of the lid this color is so
beautiful as we love it and it just
creates a very very open it had
beautiful effect
I'm then going to over line it with the
other batik little liner in the shade
Midnight Cowboy just create a pop of
bitter on the center of the lid and then
going after the bottom off and when you
do want that for orange final call for
mascara I'm going to be a benefit roller
lash mascara physical being boys
all-time favorite and if I'll have it
IME a highlighter which is actually so
bomb I really do love it and created a
beautiful glow from Laura and finally
for the lip underneath is you a gloss
and skinny dip and that sweet this looks
big on I can breathe again and this is
the completed product on Lauren she's in
a prominent I don't look like she's
making it but we set up a little bit you
can tell her she has a black strapless
just not giving flag today to fill trial
