Natalie Portman at Star Wars that makeup
and that like no like crown and the
Cornucopia on her head sister Natalie

thank you I'm so sorry
I'm so so sorry I'm just gonna drive
with you how do I transfer this oh we're
going very black swuan sharpie it's very
large selection of brush this over here
I need a fix whatever anyways oh all
right let's so the girlies at home all
right so the girlies at home no I'm
using this thing that's a bunch of
callers 35o palette use coach I guess
I'm not giving them promo you guys I
have the Jaclyn help al peel it um it's
a bunch of circles with collars this is
for your eyelids right it looks like a
fun dip it's just so pigmented
oh so this is supposed to go on your
lips for the lips yeah so why don't we
pretend it's cool switch it and this is
your concealer you look like Harley
Quinn oh yeah
I'd like to oh you too bro flowing
unibrow okay right you know like not
like full unibrow just like kind of you
didn't shave it
- neighs unibrow you know yeah that's
good done thank you
okay okay smells good it's all over your
shirt it sounds like Grandma yeah it
smells like a grandma's closet like when
you have mothballs in it every makeup
video I've watched they've done that it
and I've wanted to do it but we have to
go in eyelashes oh god I dropped it glue
good okay so four lashes I have the lily
lodges and the style Miami's use coach
AIDS we're trying to percent off I'm
gonna give one laughs - sister Elisha
and one lost your sister Christine do
you put it on the eyelash or do you put
it on your eyelid I'm gonna cheat and
tell you definitely on my life because
you don't want yeah yeah you don't want
me to be wrong cuz I was gonna go that's
okay you know what Oh does it feel
correct
no no it's cuz it's not oh my god that
eyelash is so pigmented what does that
even mean you look like a terrifying
clown let's let's do a little review
shall we let's do a little reveal here
we go oh okay Elijah your lash is like
kind of on there what is this my
favorite poster if the concealer grabs
the conceal it's definitely a good a
good touch I also love that you both
want for wing no I was gonna say wing
but see a little Jenner mines it's a
generous it's like it's like you know
like the sex of rubbish Evan got the lot
it's no it's always a crop duster yeah
this is a good look I think yeah so
normally I would start with the benefit
Porefessional what's Christine dead
Elijah I just not at all
I did not use that at all next to be
that Make Up For Ever foundation stick
which Eliza did I did you said all over
the face Christine did not - so next I
would do next I would do a concealer and
I'd put it underneath the eyes and then
on the seventh of the forehead and on
the chin so I knew that I did that right
which is with the wrong product next I
would usually set my face using a powder
the entire face neither one of you did
this
so next idea is the benefit hoola
bronzer to go on like my cheek area -
and forehead - like bronze me up like
that my summer glow right no disappeared
but is we're still probably really hot
Coast us from the Traveling Pants okay
so because his sister magnifica sisters
and Traveling Pants and then he was
saying bronze and it made me think of
like getting a tan and then it made me
think of going to Greece and how Alexis
Modell's character goes to Greece and
meets kosis and Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants and that's why it wasn't
random next I would do the eyeshadow so
it going with the palette palette
palette correct both sisters here
definitely succeeded in well let's get
the Chi whose is better and then I would
do eyeliner normally so both wings are
definitely an adventure an adventure I
would call them an adventure I think
there's better I would say Christine's
it's probably a little bit more thin so
that's two point and it has a little bit
more shape to her whereas the lashes is
more freeform right it's very it's very
spirit like it's free spirit kind of it
does what it wants to then I would do
mascara on the lashes it's Christine
decided that it would be good for her to
start with that it makes no difference I
I would disagree so I think overall
should we like pick a winner yeah both
flaws no I think the losers you know I
think the loser is definitely me never
being honest here I feel like allies are
probably best no look at his cheek
obviously you didn't win well it was the
blush moment she wanted to do a little
okay pizza lips was the lips also a
blush - oh man I think the lips tanked
the lips pertain to your whole genuinely
embarrassed about the lip thing you
really thought that's where I what I
thought you would be I thought you were
doing a bit no I thought you were trying
to be funny I was like oh that's funny
it's gonna get all his teeth but no you
just thought that was lazy
actually I have a genuine question my
elbows are so drying of lotion alright
