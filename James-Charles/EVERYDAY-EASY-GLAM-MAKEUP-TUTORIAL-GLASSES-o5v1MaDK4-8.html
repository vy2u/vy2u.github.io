back to my youtube channel lately I've
been traveling so much doing so many fun
and crazy things but because of that I
have not have time to sit down and do a
crazy makeup look in a long time I've
gotten really great at this point doing
my everyday makeup routine and this is a
look right here that I always go for
it's very very similar to a normal day
I'm just less of each product and it's a
lot more simplistic I was doing skin
bumpy brows light on the eyes
simple liner and lashes and of course a
nude lip I also talked on my clear
aviators which I've been rocking our
time lately and you guys have been
loving them they're certainly my
favorite accessory right now if you guys
like to see how treated this local right
here make sure you keep on watching so
fur coats are as always prime my face is
my benefit Porefessional primer I'm
going to Laura primer crane I just got
back from a long time being away from
home I was in Punta Cana that Rachael
you guys saw the vlogs I was in
California for three weeks then I went
to Mellie or Tasha sweating it was so
much fun and I'm back home for just one
week to finish up high school but I'm
finally done thank darling I get to move
and that start my career out in LA I am
so freaking excited but my skin is not
enjoying being back into New York
weather I think I'm just like really
stressed out but I'm getting a pretty
bad break out and I'm really not too
happy about it we're going to conceal
don't feel don't let them know not today
at least so glad to be home I've always
I'm going to probably nose using my
morphe r32 brush and my mac studio
finish concealer you guys should know
why I do this by now my nose contour
times do a slip and slide around because
my nose is super oily so putting the
extra layer on there even on my everyday
makeup routine really helps everything
to it stay in place for foundation on
the determined Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
stick in the shade why research is I'm
just going to start drying out on my
face I've been getting a lot of comments
lately it's a like James you use all the
same products these it's what
and I promise I was like bitch this is
my channel and I was like hmm you're
kind of right though
and I thought about it some more and I
was like you know what I am NOT someone
who does reviews I'm not someone who
test out new products very often I kind
of do a lot of crazy makeup look as you
guys know and I occasionally do simple
glam like this I've been traveling so
much lately which is why you guys have
been seeing so much simple super easy
kind of boring around my uncertainty too
if they haven't had time release it
under crazy looks but I really like the
products that I work on I tend to not
switch them up just because notes are
really work for me occasionally
new things oils do make it into our
routine like brushes I started health
and stuff like that but for the most
part my babies always the same because
this is what really works for my skin
type I have pretty complicated skin I
know it'll look good every single time
so I tend to not push it up very much
sorry there were plenty of other YouTube
channels out there in the world if you
want to look at some new products or any
device shape to consider from Tarte once
you highlight my face anyways moving on
I'm just blending this into my damp
Beauty Blender then I'm going to have a
tiny bit of the tab on D where else
you'll see it and just make a fewer dot
under my eyes and inside of my forehead
same place I put the concealer is
obviously not using as much as this
because we don't want to look too pale
but I'm pretty pasty already so I like
to add as much contrast to my face as
possible if you are new subscribers only
professional hello I hope you enjoyed
our wedding makeup video together and I
just came back from Maui and I got to go
to her wedding which was so much fun
living one of the most beautiful and fun
experiences of my entire life
it was just so crazy because I've been
launching coffee for like probably three
years now almost and three years ago I
called myself one of her biggest fans
and now after doing makeup for only a
year and a half I got to go to her
wedding and drew her makeup for her
wedding which is literally so crazy so
it's so cool how the intimate like
brings people together I don't know it's
a cute story okay so quickly blend up
the crease underneath my eyes Ben's
going to be Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder I have not used in a long
long time I'm restauranteur by Mac
Studio Fix foundation powder in my
morphe 48 and put that in the same place
I got my concealer
basically by like super easy
wearable glare that maker Brooking is
the exact same as my like full-on glam
crazy makeup routine I'll just use a
whole lot less of the same products to
brought the day today I'm using to get
cow blondie show you two light kit
shocking and I'm going to use this new
brush from the more via copper
collection these brushes are so freakin
printing I actually have yet to use them
I just go home like I said so I just got
a chance to open up all my PR packages
on the diamond and love with copper
lately you guys have no idea how excited
I am to move on decorating my own place
living walking it's my house gonna be
like walking into a Pinterest board and
I literally cannot wait this brush is
actually so great for contouring and
bronze me I'm kind of shook right now
it's much more dense so I'm used to but
it puts on the color like really really
nicely what is the name of this Oh
doesn't have a name okay maybe you
actually have to buy the entire set
together either I remember you can
always use code genius or 10% of all
products that morphe you all know that
they are one likes a brands I'm really
lately going to use like JD maybe 180
brush to contour my nose I'm going to
focus on using the middle shade of the
parallel like always but I'm not going
to go as heavy admirable because this is
everyday makeup and not something so
intense and drag see ya next to make my
face I'm going to take more of my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and this
brush from the Mordy copper collection
and dip it in in that top on the powder
so while in case thanks for a few
minutes I'm going to go ahead and I'm
going to turn it on my brows now my
eyebrows are one step to actually does
drastically change for my life to
program routines my everyday makeup
routine usually you guys I would go to
my Anasazi on dip brow but Salem using
my benefit processing my brow pencil in
the shade number five to slay these
brows what if they're off by just
lightly at calling through the hairs and
brushing of upwards in the direction
that I want them to go as you guys can
see I already have super thick natural
growth and the chemists are not my kind
of sketching in detail because
marbella kind of stops abruptly here and
I want to make sure there's at least
some design
and that's how the only thing I really
like to find so after that I'm just
going to go through and I'm going to
create a little hair like strokes just
to kind of build out that shape a little
bit in any areas that are more sparse
none of this every area where I want to
heavier made a mistake on this goal of
the spoolie on the other end and I'll
kind of just brush through that to kind
of erase and blend it in a little bit as
you guys can see this is much lighter
than my normal pretty heavy brow and it
also is a lot quicker so this is just
version you like to do our best
photographs a little bit of Maya shape
tapes into tho and I will be 49m begin
to sketch out underneath that brow I
left a little bit of a sparse area right
up in here some this going to add a few
more little lines without benefit pencil
and then to finish off the vellum
vinegar with my benefit gimme brow gel
in the shade number five and just brush
those hairs upwards to try to create
that bushy but still natural brow effect
now you guys could totally felt her if
you wanted to pop on your favorite
mascara highlighter and some chapstick
and just walk out the door but you guys
know me even for everyday glam I still
going to be a little bit extra so for my
eyes today I'm using me a brand new
limited edition morphia Bruns mobile
kala purchases did already fellow
unfortunately but a lot of these active
enough to do me asked me to do is trail
on this so I'm going to use it today and
you don't have this view 35k
also some more be is a wonderful
alternative with similar shades a person
would have this neutral toned orange
shade on my m4 for one and use that in
my crease as a transition shade and then
hundred and four three three I'm going
to grab this cool tone brown shade to
look below at the orange we use before
and I'm going to deepen out the outer V
and then the white Ameth 514 I'm going
to go up this dark brown shade of right
in the bottom row and I'm going to
deepen out a little bit more
I'm not going to grab my m4 / one that I
started off with and it's already sheets
make sure they are nice and blended out
I'm going to add a quick way using my la
girl line art matte liquid liner oh my
god I'm a huge pimple over the follow my
wings usually end so this is a human
thing very very challenging today and
this la girl liner is circuiting for me
I don't even know how I'm going to dress
this situation anyway essentially not a
gene I need to go to bed soon because I
have coral so I'm just going to move on
the lower lash line I wonder got my m4
33 and the same Lauren shaker before
insert that lower transition shade
regarding the medium brown once again on
my my 14 I'm going to blend and darken
outer corner and then with light to 13
and they dark brown change that I use
from before I'm going to really lightly
Holly the lower lash line and the last
one we're going to use like OCC pencil
in the shade feathers to open on my eyes
and make them look super bright you know
these are you like doing her makeup and
literally everything is going wrong
that's what's happening to me right now
my liner got messed up then I try to
line my upper waterline and my contact
off black on it and then I had to take
it out then I was crying and I had to
wait my foundation off it had been a
night say the least but I pulled
everything apart together wiped my tears
cause some translucent powder and we're
going to cable it on because I don't
have the energy to refill this video
around here today I'm using my a benefit
roller lash
alas today I'm going to pop on my new
base the house lashes iconic if you
would salt earlier on and did you
eyeshadow or liner but still want a
little bit of drama with your lashes I
would totally recommend the Lily last in
the style Miami there another one of my
absolute fave shocking we have an issue
an inner corner was to fly off can let
them go right tonight
one thing that's only one thing I don't
my god oh my god oh my god the lashes
check it on the best I'm I'm this
excited about a mile of oil on the first
trying should just put you into
perspectives how copy
let's make a page but so far so on the
upper waterline again since I already
credit Olaf I'm going to use the NYX
jumbo eye pencil in a black bean all
right my next step is going to be to add
some a big freckle just omit the nose
and cheek region you guys know me and
you know that this is with my favorite
things to add to an everyday makeup look
is my beautiful that I'm just going to
go over those freckles to Lily welcome
into the skin since this is everyday
glam I feel like we need to make out
what we were lacking in eyeshadow lifts
all the fancy fun stuff with highlighter
to get the glow on today I will use my
Monte 501 as usual and the Oprah
highlighter in the shade blissful
remember you can use Kona chance to 30%
off all over products
oh wow suddenly I'm lined I'm just
probably the summit on my cheeks
otherwise and I also like the Prophet
right about my brow bone it when I do
more and natural and glowy look welcome
back I know it's been only a second for
you guys but it's been an hour for me
because my camera decide literally as I
say what else can go wrong just throw it
out me because at this point I'm ready
anyways to finish off this look finally
I'm going to go to my comedy a bow and
arrow liquid lipstick this is my
all-time favorite new shade I always
start when I do like light makeup looks
new guys always ask it says all day I
would definitely recommend
holy crap I think that was the fastest
I've ever done my list in my entire life
and we're going to finish this up with
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray after all the mistakes we made
