back to my youtube channel first today's
video we're gonna be doing something so
crazy that no beauty guru has ever done
before and that none of us really like
to talk about and that is face tuning
you guys know I'm definitely the
self-proclaimed queen of face to it
let's be real I am very very very good
at it and if you guys see me on
Instagram you would know that a sister
loves a good tune I just really really
love a photo editing and in my opinion
as long as you're not editing a makeup
actually on a photo editing and
retouching is just as much of an art as
actual makeup itself I've literally
become so known for facesitting at this
point that not only do i edit my own
photos but so many different Instagram
celebrities and youtubers that you guys
all know and love I will not release any
names but also some of their photos to
edit to so half the time that you guys
are seeing are really bomb photo on
Instagram especially if it involves
makeup probably went through me first as
well though I also always get a ton of
questions from you guys about different
editing tips tricks and techniques and a
few days ago I tweeted on Twitter asking
what if I did a video where I edited
your guys's southies
and it got like a 40,000 likes or
something absolutely crazy so for
today's video I tweeted asking you babes
to tell me your unedited and makeup
selfies something that you want fixed
and call me crazy but I'm gonna facetune
your guys's selfies just a quick little
just summer before we get really into
this video if you're someone who does
not believe or enjoy photo editing
please do me a favor and click the
little X button right up here we do not
need you here and I definitely do not
want any annoying comments this video is
just for fun I want to make it very
clear that like I said beforehand I view
photo editing is this as much of an art
form as actual makeup itself but I will
never actually edit makeup on when
you're taking selfies there's a lot of
different variables that can really
affect the final photo such as lighting
the environment that you're in the angle
that the photo was taken it and the
actual camera you're using so what I'm
editing pictures I only like to make the
selfie that already exists a little bit
better using photo editing techniques
but I never will actually add makeup and
I never change my face to where I'm not
recognizable anymore for me personally
you guys know I love a good face to
moment and I am very very open and
honest about the fact that my photos are
all very very edited but at the same
time you guys see me on YouTube every
single week unedited and raw and also on
snapchat and Instagram stories all day
long and a lot of you met me in person
too so it's not like I'm really trying
to hide anything there is nothing wrong
with fixing any insecurities and making
your highlight really pop in a photo or
making your eyeshadow colors a little
bit more vibrant as long as you're not
crossing any lines and as long as you're
open and honest about it so without
further adieu all that is out of the way
let's jump into the video all right guys
let's jump right in the first response
we have to this tweet is sister Katie
bruised Lamora another fellow Beauty
influencer and he said can you fix my
flashback
oh no unfortunately if this were fixable
I wouldn't have this candle in the first
place okay so seriously now for the
first time sister Zoe said fix my nose
please and thanks and she said and this
selfie right here Wow a sister looks
beautiful and snot let's good and Sasha
snows up just a little bit more alright
so let's go ahead and open the photo and
facetune and we're first gonna stock
with a sister reshape skinnier than
Mariah so first what I want to do is go
ahead and take this smooth tool and I
want to go over all of the sister Zoe
skin to kind of create an even base all
throughout especially when it comes to
it the nose region usually you guys know
I like to just have everything in
because if it looks too smooth it looks
very very fake and cross it and bust it
and they're gonna get clocked a real
thought first sister to date and even
though I like to edit my photos the
house down boots I like to look them as
real as possible next I want to do is
grab the tones tool and then grab a
picker
and I want to pick the lightest tan
color right on the center of her cheek
and I'm gonna go back to tones and then
I'm going to lightly tap on this light
tan color all around her cheek area and
onto the side of Zoe's nose bridge so
next I want to do is go back into tones
I've got the picker and then I'm gonna
take a dark kind of brown shade and I'm
gonna pick it right from Zoe's contour
over here and I'm gonna use this color -
now sketch in a new nose bridge if that
makes sense
so basically you guys know what I like
to contour my nose because I definitely
have a very very large
sister schnoz that I like to just snatch
that was a lot whoa and the closer you
draw the two lines together this smaller
your nose it's going to look I'm gonna
go back and as always nose with this
dark brown color and I'm gonna sketch in
to nose contour lines and obviously this
is gonna look very very intense but
we're gonna blend them out so now that
they turn into poor so we do an anteater
here I'm gonna grab the eraser tool and
I'm gonna lightly tap over those two
lines to soften everything
make it not look absolutely crazy and
then it once again a smooth tool to kind
of blend everything out so now that we
have the contours and the brightness
built in we definitely need to add some
highlights to really provide a contrast
and finish off this sister nose snot
what I want to do is grab the tones tool
once again as you can see this is a very
very similar theme all throughout I
don't gonna go to palette right over
here and what I want to grab for Zoe's
skin tone is a shade right in between
yellow and orange barely Goldy Sheen and
then or right up at the top I want to
drag this color picker to like an
off-white type of color then I'm gonna
go right in and top right on at the tip
of the nose and then kind of right down
the bridge focusing it mostly right in
between the eyebrows all right guys are
we ready for the iconic before and after
here we go
before and after ooh literally so good
it looks like she can barely even
breathe do you guys know that it's
always my goal when it comes to editing
my nose contour and as well nose contour
is one of those things that is very much
affected by lighting sometimes it can
look really really bomb and the right
lighting and sometimes if you're in a
very shadowed lighting it can look
literally at the worst I just fix ups
always nose nice and good it made its
sister snatch and I think she will
definitely love this and for all of you
guys out there if you're like me and
you're on a budget saving for a sister
house that is how you get a rhinoplasty
with facetune let's move on to the next
sister selfie so we obviously want to
work with her nose done hello a little
restain girl so good we went to somebody
else who wants a different feature fixed
oh okay this baby's from a sister Emily
and she says I wear my makeup for an
hour when this photo was taken the
foundation was a little bit splotchy but
the vibrancy and the eye shadow isn't as
much as I want it also do anything to
make it look less wrong let me move
every selfie ever and she attached this
photo of herself oh my god hello girl
you look so beautiful your eyeshadow
looks amazing it looks like this is
actually a recreation of my coachella
look so definitely down to help a sister
out with this let's pull this into
facetune and see what we can do so in
this photo Emily said that her
foundation was a little bit splotchy but
in my opinion I think it looks really
really beautiful and bright
natural-looking I definitely want to
focus in on the eyes for this because
she said that she wishes the eye shadow
was a little bit brighter and more
pigmented so I'm just gonna zoom right
in and when it comes to working with the
eyes the first thing that I always like
to do is do it the details tool I'll
just tap a little triangle right down
here and then I'm gonna go in and
lightly tap over both of the eyes this
really brings up the saturation it makes
the block of the eyeliners definitely
darker makes the eyes pop a little bit
and just makes the eyes in general more
eye-catching if that makes sense
whatever I'm editing an eye shadow
especially colorful look on based it I
would like to do it in the same exact
order that I would apply and so for this
I'm assuming because I did this as well
that she started off with the colors in
the crease and so what I want to do is
grab the tones to it right down here and
I'm gonna start off with the right eye
or I guess her left eye hello and I'm
gonna grab a yellow tone first and I'm
gonna grab it right over here and I'm
just gonna start off by lightly tapping
right in it dot regen then I'm gonna go
right in with orange topping right next
door
same thing with the red right next door
as well and then already it's looking so
much brighter but let's be real Adelphia
looks a little bit fake right now so I'm
assuming she was going for a half cut
crease so what I'm gonna do is grab the
eraser tool and zoom way in and I'm
gonna lightly scrub over that crease
region to make sure that it still looks
nice and cut and then I'm gonna zoom out
and lightly tap over that entire eye to
keep the shadow that we've blended in it
but only make it like 50% there that
makes sense so it's just a little bit of
a boost but not to the point where it's
like fake and looks like a literal
rainbow on the eye so before I go into
the eraser tool just like I did in the
other eye if there's one a really
important thing that I want to note that
I can't I self personally doing all the
time and is a major major major major
facetune know know that it's gonna give
away the fact that it's edited real
quick so whatever you're taking a selfie
at like sister Emily or like me have you
turned your head to the side and you
take a selfie of course we get that good
jawline we got that good highlight but
whatever eye is facing away from the
camera is never going to be as bright as
the other eye because there is it light
hitting it so you can help it out a
little bit but definitely be careful and
use it at your own risk so as you can
see before and after before and after
definitely hoping out the pigmentation a
little bit without going insane like
we've done the other eye
I think I'm popular that so next in this
makeup tutorial if I'm remembering
correctly I cut the crease using
concealer and then glitter and I was
doing Emily did the same exact thing so
I want to make that glitter on her lid a
little bit brighter if you zoom in as
you can see it right here on the lid you
can see that she has some specks of
light which tells me she did put a
glitter there but I'm losing the
lighting she was and didn't exactly pick
it up so let's bring it back a little
bit I'm first gonna grab the tones tool
once again
when to palette and a light yellowy kind
of worn shade and go all the way over to
the left and an off-white and then I'm
gonna sketch that right in between the
lashes are really important technique
winter face suiting is always a top
things and as opposed to scrubbing it on
especially when it comes to eyeshadow
stuff because if you're wearing lashes
the last thing that you want to do is
cover up those losses with whatever fake
glow you're putting on because it's
gonna look really really fake and really
really bad I think I'm definitely happy
with that animate the lid much nicer
brighter definitely the glitter looks
like it's actually there now and while
we're still on that kind of a light
yellow white shade does like I did on
sister Zoe with the no snatching I want
to add a little bit of that shader right
here into the inner corner to make her
inner corner highlight a little bit
brighter and then same thing right up
here on the brow bone it's really
intensify that highly and add a little
bit more contrast and attention to the
eye once again eraser tool just lightly
topping over that and that looks so
snatched similar to rely shadow the last
some of editing is what's going to be
the blocks or the dark shades and you
always or the sensation that nothing
gets really really muddy kind of tones
one last time and grab a black and zoom
all the way in and I'm just gonna start
lightly packing this right into the
crease to kind of add a little bit more
dimension onto the outer corner and then
as well right underneath that eye region
because as you can see there's a little
bit of lightness in her crease that she
probably did not want there and then
tapping it in included that looks a
little bit crazy and ridiculous
so once again grabbing the eraser tool
and just lightly tapping over everything
to keep a little bit of that dimension
but just erasing it so it still looks a
little bit natural and last I'm finally
not at least when it comes to editing
the eyes at this step is totally
optional I personally love to do this in
all my photos it's really what gives me
that doll like luck that a lot of you
guys love it's going to be to brighten
the actual eye so in this photo emily
has beautiful bright blue eyes but
clearly she's wearing a pretty big
luscious and black eyeliner so they did
get a little bit lost inside what I want
to do is grab the tones to all once
again and I'm gonna dip into a kind of
like an aqua shade then zoom into the
pupils and I'm just gonna kind of place
that color right in the bottom and a
little bit of a rounded u-shape there it
is girl so good hello she thought it
staring it's my soul love da then of
course erasers will top over it so it's
not too intense and too scary alright I
think we're ready for before-and-after
numero dos let's go to take a look at
what we were able to do - Emily's
rainbow eyeshadow look we have the
before and the
- literally so cute as you can see we do
not actually edit any makeup on just
edited what was already there to make it
a little bit more intense more vibrant
more eye-catching and I think this looks
so beautiful and so stunning and this is
actually like the same exact I think
that I used to edit my Coachella rainbow
makeup look photo so how do you guys
recreate the look try this out and try
any of these techniques with your eye
shadow looks I guarantee it'll make your
makeup look so much more beautiful and
so much more pop in it for your sister
selfies alright guys so let's see who
our next victim is that we already did a
nose Kandra and also the eye region so I
think I next what I focus on skin
you're kidding hello Britney J said give
me a stat shows and a blinding highly
also this was a recreation of one of
your looks you guys are all so pretty
and talented what the huh oh here's this
going to be okay Leah said can you fix
my skin please sister make it look snaps
let's see hello it literally already is
- okay I'm not gonna help her but this
does bring up a really good point that I
actually want to mention when it comes
to editing skin and once again and this
is saying that I catch myself doing a
lot what are the biggest no-nose of face
to ever is over editing the skin there's
this smooth tool and there's a super
smooth tool moving can only go so far
obviously it always like to start out
with the smooth tool just lightly tap
over everything to kind of even out the
base I personally love the look of a
little bit of skin texture even if
there's a few imperfections in there
because I think it makes the photos look
a lot more raw and a lot more real and
if you're editing a lot more believable
okay let's see who we can actually help
out here hello okay this is a selfie
from a sister anarchy I love her I
follow her on Twitter hey girl what's up
and she sent me this beautiful host
makeup selfie with this beautiful
penguin on it hey girl
loved that and she actually gave us a no
comment so I want to take this healthy
bird and focus on the skin because
there's a few things that I want to
change to make this photo just a little
bit better all right so we have this
photo up and ready to go and the first
step is always going to be the smooth
tool she literally has almost perfect
skin but she does have a few blemishes
right here on the cheek that we can
definitely get rid of super easily I'm
gonna grab the patch tool like duct go
right over the pimple area and then
bring it to an area right next door in
the contour just to get rid of it and
click the checkmark and bam gone wow so
easy is so beautiful
can I go right over this same exact
thing click the little check mark wow
blemishes never heard of them for me
personally when I'm editing photos if I
have a really bad pimple that's always
the absolute first thing to go I'm very
very insecure about my acne and I know
a lot of you guys out there are as well
but if you're able to rock your acne and
feel beautiful and confident with it go
you at major props
unfortunately for myself cannot say the
same but if any you guys want to know
how to edit it out patch tool that's how
so now we go back into our normal
regular routine a cell going the sister
a smooth tool just to kind of blend
everything together and just give you a
nice and even base as you can see here
if I click the before and after it still
keeps a lot of that skin texture and a
lot of the dimensions of her face but it
does blend out some of those harsher
areas and contours making everything
look really really beautiful and more
smooth so much of the eye shadow I now
when I grab the details tool and I want
to just detail over any features such as
the eyes the eyebrows and the lips
because of course we did it without the
skin and I don't want to lose any of
that and dimension and I was time for
the tone school and this is literally
like my all-time secret to getting a
perfect skin and freeze to it can't
believe I'm about to give you guys this
full-on secret but to her welcome I love
doing charity work I'm gonna grab the
tone tool and I just want to even out
anarchies skin tone and then a recontour
it so it looks literally so incredibly
statue all about to be so shot gonna
grab the picker tool and I'm gonna grab
this kind of light ish yellow shade or
right here underneath her eye and I'm
gonna use that and tones and I'm going
to kind of brush that over this entire
region do not change the color I'm gonna
grab that same exact shade of yellow and
I'm gonna pop that right in the center
of her forehead right over her upper lip
region as well if you're like me and
you're a man you probably have a 5
o'clock shot off that if you're like
anarchy and you have beautiful big lips
usually your lip tends to flip up which
gives a natural shadow in this region so
sometimes it's really good to put a
highlighter there to kind of counteract
that so it doesn't look like a really
weird and gross 5 o'clock shadow that
most of us probably do not want I'm also
gonna pop a little bit of this yellow
right here right kind of on the jaw line
region or right in between like this
contour area and then similar to every
other process so far I'm gonna grab the
eraser tool and I'm gonna lightly tap
over that entire region to keep the
color that I just added but make it a
little bit less intense so it's not like
the most and like literally bright
yellow okay so we just highlighted and
our key space by adding a lot of yellow
all around but she is a woman of color
and the last thing that I want to do is
lighten her skin tone or give her a
flashy moment that is so not the one for
today so now I want to Carter rock those
highlights by a contouring a little bit
I'm gonna grab the tones tool once again
and we're gonna grab a show you to kind
of on the outer perimeter of her face
right up in here by her hair
and I want to use that brown shade with
the tones tool to kind of add in and
intensify a little bit of those contours
to really bring a lot more dimension
back so I'm gonna place that right in
the hollows of her cheekbones kind of
right along her nose bridge similar to
sister Zoe from before hand and also
right up in that hairline region to make
that forehead look nice and snatched
when you're editing - before you go
ahead and save or erase anything it's
really important to check the little
blue button down here and select your
before and afters to see where your
color actually is as you can see right
here I accidentally put a little bit of
brown it and our he's hair and I
definitely did not want that there so
we're gonna have the eraser tool and
just go right over at that region
because if that looks like crusted
busted and I actually have some brown up
here as well this contour looks
absolutely beautiful once again like I
said I'm gonna take the eraser tool
though and kind of soften it a little
bit because let's be real it's looking a
little bit harsh and I don't want her to
look crusted just a little bit more
chiseled alright guys I think we are
ready for our before and after sister
anarchy ready here we go we have the
before and BAM the after oh my god
literally so it's not as you can see it
by using the tones to it and the details
too and the smooth tool you're able to
really even out that skin tone and make
it look so much more smooth while still
keeping all of the different highlights
and contours and looking beautiful and
defined these are the techniques that I
use in all of my photos to get beautiful
skin so hopefully you guys were able to
follow that and it was a little bit
complicated but I think anarchy is going
to absolutely love this alright sister
so those are three photos of you guys
all completely edited we started off
with this is your nose contour eye
shadow and then also skin off through
and I feel like that had all of the
different points that really go into my
face tuning routine but this video would
only be fair if now I have to face soon
myself and tell you guys what am i
before afters I done this a few times
before but let's be real I definitely
face tune a lot so I thought it'd be fun
to kind of look through some of the
photos that I've been taking recently
and show you guys what it takes to go
from a regular photo to Instagram ready
let's go through a camera roll and find
a good and fresh sister Instagram a
selfie so that's you can see of 8201
photos I definitely need to go through
and clean those up soon a lot of them
are a selfie okay I have these always
from a Shake Shack a few days ago I took
them while I was eating fries I've been
in fresh photo shoot let's see of course
you get to pick up the one that I want
first and there's
a lot of them oh my god the lighting and
Shake Shack is literally the worst hello
wait that's not hey Shake Shack I love
you please sponsor me okay I just go
through all these and the bad lighting
and the bad outfit choice not exactly my
favorite not even gonna lie but I think
that I finally decided on this photo to
possibly be grabbed don't even know
might be doing this editing all for
nothing but I'm gonna pull this one
right in to face suit and I'm gonna show
you guys the full-on process I'll get a
speed through this because it's nothing
gonna be a lengthy process but you guys
get to watch enjoy
literally 20 minutes later that was ugly
a long visioning process but this photo
had a lot of saving to do let's be real
and I probably will even go back into
this later on and I think I'm ready to
show you guys this iconic sister James
Charles Instagram ready before and after
ready we have of course the before that
you guys all saw and one two three BAM
the after hello there was definitely a
lot that I wanted to do if we look at
the before and afters as if idli on the
base yeah sister needed a little bit of
work there was this really weird and
very very dark line going down the
entire side of my face I have no idea
what that was I'm assuming it was a
shadow from either like a windowpane or
something lord knows that's not usually
there at least I hope not
I did do a little bit of reshaping and
you guys know I'm very very insecure
about the size of my forehead so brought
her down just a little bit and then for
the most part I just evened out my skin
tone using the same techniques that we
used on sister anarchy slim down the
nose but just a little bit using the
same techniques we used on sister Zoe
and then detailed the eyes like we did
on sister Emily that was super simple
then I finished it off using a not so
simple filter it does add a really
really cool effect and I think that that
is it the finished photo and I really
like how this turned out I was a little
bit spooked at first not gonna lie but I
think this might be Instagram ready
maybe erase sisters that is only half
for this videos today and not even gonna
lie I just had so much fun for the past
few hours editing all these pictures
base hitting is on my all-time favorite
pastimes so hopefully you guys all watch
us to learn some helpful and do it tips
and tricks that you can use next time
you're editing your Instagram pictures I
want to say a major thank you - Zooey
Emily and anarchy for all sending in
their unedited photos today it sounds
kind of cheesy to say but honestly post
an unedited photo online these days is
very very very brave you guys know like
I was talking about earlier literally
everybody edits their photos at this
point and it's something that I really
really love to do hopefully learn some
helpful tips and techniques and you guys
get to see that I never really like to
edit on makeup but really change myself
much I just like to edit and enhance
what's already there to take your photo
so I'm pretty good and really really
beautiful to like literally the best
ever have everybody shaking and having
wigs snatched left and right also side
note that I've been thinking about this
entire video like I just think
beforehand it is obviously okay to edit
to fix any insecurities that you may
have or just to make your photos look
really
Bob but it is so important that you guys
love yourselves love your bodies and
love the person that you are and of
course if you want to change that it's a
very very personal decision but you
should definitely not rely on face tune
to be someone that you were absolutely
not as I was looking through all the
pictures that you guys sent in today I
was continuously stuff like every few
seconds of how beautiful you all are of
how talented you are and I just want to
say if cheesy moment that I do love you
and you guys are all so incredibly
beautiful and this video was 100%
strictly all for fun please do not go
crazy with these tips and techniques I
just want to show you guys a little bit
more about what I do but it is important
to love yourself I love myself with or
without face to reshape the tones to all
the details tool to smooth tool and
everything in between
