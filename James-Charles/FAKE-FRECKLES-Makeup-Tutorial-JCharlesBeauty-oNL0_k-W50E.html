awesome hi guys it's James again a lot
of you guys have been asking me how I
add fake freckles to a lot of my makeup
looks and today I'm going to show you
how I'm only going to be using two
products so this should be super fast
and super easy so if you want to learn
how to recreate these freckles make sure
to keep on watching
toasting off today I'm going to be using
my Anasazi of brow Wiz in dark brown
freckles form on the high points of the
face when you're in the Sun so it's
going to be concentrated mostly in this
area but as well as on the chin and the
five head I'm going to be starting off
by drawing just little dots all around
this area because I'm going to have my
freckles mostly concentrated here
there's really no specific pattern you
should be following just kind of let
your hand keep tapping because we're
going to blend them out in a few seconds
anyway but it will really help make it
look more natural make sure to also
bring them onto your nose bridge and the
tip of your nose but definitely more
concentrated on the sides
now that I'm done putting the dots on my
nose and cheek area I'm going to go
ahead and add a few more on my forehead
and changes to balance everything out
normally people that have freckles have
a lot of beauty marks and it looks um
not as natural if you just have them
here but that's totally up to you now
that I have my first layer done I'm
going to go over the dots with my Beauty
Blender not all freckles of the same
color and same shape so going over it
with a Beauty Blender really helps to
make sure they look natural and even
before I go in with my second darker
color now I'm going back in with my brow
Wiz now that I blended them out and
concentrating some more freckles on the
sides of my nose because this is where
they're ultimately most likely to form
and then just once again bringing a few
little ones out to the sides once again
just went back over them with a Beauty
Blender as the final step just add some
more variation to the freckles I'm going
it with my Anasazi a dip brow in dark
brown and a morphe liner brush this is
the m25 0-0 once again just placing some
dots but mostly concentrating it on the
inner corners of the nose now that I
have those that instead of going in with
my Beauty Blender this time I'm just
gonna use my fingers to tap on the sides
to make sure everything is nice and
blended by using your fingers it kind of
makes the freckles melt into the skin
rather than actually blending the brow
using the Beauty Blender so it gives a
more natural finish and that's it guys
we're done I told you it was super easy
and now you can add fake freckles to any
look I really hope you enjoyed this
video if you did and it was helpful make
sure to give it a big thumbs up down
