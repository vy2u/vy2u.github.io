welcome back to my youtube channel as
you guys know it is October meeting it
is my favorite time of the entire year I
love fall season is so so so so so much
I'll like the falling leaves and the hot
cocoa and the pumpkin spice lattes and
the cute decorations and
trick-or-treating on Halloween oh my god
I literally love it so much and I am so
excited as well to get back into all the
fun makeup looks like cranberries dark
Browns oh I am so so so here for it
obviously I'm fortunate I live in LA
well not really unfortunately I love it
here but in LA it is still very very hot
so I'm literally dying in this
turtleneck and denim jacket but I had to
get into the fall mood for you guys
sacrifices last night well my fighters
over I was editing a video and my friend
decided to unbox all my PR boxes on
snapchat which by the way if you don't
have me Ida you should definitely go
check me out over there I post on there
all the time and do lots of fun
unboxings rants story times etc but yeah
my firmus over here is unboxed
everything and I literally realized how
much freaking makeup I've been sent in
the past few weeks I was a little bit
shook because I had like literally 30
boxes to open but I was so excited to
try a ton of view products for today's
video I grabbed a bunch of products that
are new releases or products that I have
not yet tried out and did a full face of
fall first impressions makeup and I
absolutely love how this look turned out
spoiler alert
almost all the products that they use
today are really really really great so
without further ado if you'd like to see
how I created this look today using all
brand new products that are actually new
to my regular routine because I know
sister James is not switch it up very
often gyri picady junkies and let's get
started alright guys so I'm first gonna
start off by priming my face using the
no horrible um primer from touch and
soul this is a smooth and pore covering
a top secret for perfect makeup primer
and I'm very very excited to try this
out I know a sister Jeffrey twice about
this all the time on his channel and
absolutely stands by it
I for one haven't actually never tried
it before so I'm very pumped you guys
know that my skin has actually been a
pretty good recently because I've been
moisturizing a lot but I definitely
still have a lot of pores unfortunately
oh wow this feels really good so three
seconds in and I already like this
primer it feels so incredibly like
smooth and the poreless but that being
said I absolutely have no product in my
face right now so let's go to some
foundation and see how it actually holds
up
for foundations today aren't gonna be
going into the milk makeup blur liquid
foundation and this isn't the shade of
golden light I hope this is the right
shade for me
these released a few weeks ago on a milk
makeup but I actually have not gotten a
chance to try them out but many of my
friends really really like this so I'm
gonna try it out for myself
I definitely like a good full coverage
foundation and you guys know that I am a
hardcore stand all the makeup ever ultra
oh that's a good match think on of the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick so it's
pretty hard at this point to ever beat
that one but let's go ahead and apply
this and see what we think
so this is a liquid foundation that is
set to dry down in a natural matte
formula meaning it it's like pretty
matte but still has like a little bit of
do to it which is definitely the styler
foundation that I like you guys know
that I am really not digging like the
full baked full matte look anymore and I
do like a little bit of a natural glow
so holy this foundation if it does what
it says will be a really really great
one for me okay so the foundation was
all applied and blend out and I don't
love it but I also don't hate it at all
the match of color is really really good
free and I'm definitely like a fan of
this it matches my scanner pretty well
which is a very rare occasion on the
channels YouTube channel I know you guys
always drive me for it my skin texture
it looks decent I've had foundations I
think my skin look better and it's
definitely hot ones that made it look
worse I noticed that it is deadly so I'm
pretty a little bit on my nose which I
hate you guys know that's like my
biggest pet peeve when it comes to nose
contour not being able to have like a
perfect one so not loving that the
coverage is really really good though
because I skin look very very even all
that being said I'm gonna go ahead and
apply the rest of my routine now and I
will come back to the foundation later
on and see how it wears that everything
else later on top obviously I don't have
any dupe concealers to try out today so
I'm just gonna use my handy dandy shave
tape in the shade of light okay so
actually after Lang shaped tape over top
of the foundation I like how this looks
a lot more and layered over top
especially in like the poor region
really really nicely I love my under
eyes look right now as well as my nose
was fixed by the same tape thank God
we're not about to have a walking nose
contour today those days are long gone
I'm gonna go ahead and set my face in
the normal place he's using the brand
new two-faced peach perfect modifying
setting powder I know Jackie ina said
she loved this I've been super looking
forward to trying out and yeah hopefully
we won't get any flash like marriage
today I'm just gonna make sure any
creases that I have under there
gone and then just pack on the setting
powder oh my god actually smells like
peaches ah that sounds the best ever oh
my god
okay whoa talk about a mattifying sign
encoder my face looks like as dry as the
Sahara Desert but not like a bad way I'm
honestly really taking it but I'm
definitely gonna have to apply a lot of
highlighter later on ask for the actual
powder first of all it smells literally
the best like this is really really good
I don't think I've ever had a setting
powder that actually smelled like good
and not like actual death or like
Grandma which is my so I like this a lot
and looking up close my pores are like
gone like literally they look so covered
and filled in this honestly may very
well be a brand new favorite I know I
don't really like baking any more but
I'm gonna go ahead and use this powder
to lightly baked just to see if it does
bring any intensity and brightness back
to the face especially I like the nose
contour region underneath the contour
like I always do
but before I do that I'm gonna go ahead
and stretch my face a few times using
some mac fix+ just because I'm looking
extremely dry right now and I need some
of that hydration brought back of my
face
now let's get up nose as usual using my
Beauty Blender and pack it onto the
areas that I want to be a little bit
brighter before I actually go to my
brows I'm gonna add a little bit of
blush using the brand new Anasazi a
blush kit and the shade radiant I would
normally do this before I actually make
my face but it completely slipped my
mind I'm gonna use this shade in the top
right hand corner called coastline it is
so pretty under mine see a little bit of
the amok in the shade peaches which you
guys always my multi-faith and I'm just
gonna apply this using my more pe4 brush
well that is really pigmented
okay so we all know Anasazi does not
play around when it comes to pigment but
I definitely put on a little bit too
much I'm gonna grab my r0 brush from
morphe and just my face powder and go
over that a little bit to kind of make
it a little bit more subtle so now that
my face is all done and baking the oven
at 350 degrees we have a little bit of a
cooking malfunction there but we're
gonna go ahead and move on and next is
going to be the brows today I don't have
any new brow products to try out for you
guys so I'm just gonna go in with my
normal benefit brow products I'm gonna
first go in with the benefit car brow
gel in the shade number 4 and start to
to find out the tail as you guys know
there was actually a really good long
while where I stopped using pomade
products on my brows altogether and just
went over to a pencil
I feel like the old James Charles block
IRA was so so bad and a very touchy and
dark subject we should talk about I
think what cause that was way too much
brow pomade so I just stopped using it
altogether but recently I've kind of
been getting it back into it just to
like really define it the brows and get
super super sharp lines and honestly I'm
actually kind of living for it we just
have to make sure that we don't get back
into that original Brown style again as
always I'm just gonna grab a little bit
of concealer on my morphe e43 brush and
clean up that bottom edge once eyebrow
is all cleaned up and defined I'm gonna
grab the 24-hour brow setter and use
this to brush all the hair Stinton place
I've actually been using this a lot more
than the Gimme brow gel and I still love
gimme brow don't get me wrong but this
one is clear it just does a really good
job of brushing the hair is like into
place but also keeping them like
literally glued down it's almost like a
liquid version of hairspray and it's I
like this law so now that the brows are
all slayed and locked in place we're
gonna move on to the eye shadow and for
today I do have a new first impressions
that I am literally so excited to try
out and that is the Laura Lee Los
Angeles cat's pajamas eyes shadow
palette I cannot wait so this is the
actual palette it is absolutely stunning
it comes with ten shades for $40 which
is only $4 a shadow which is not bad at
all I will say I have not put this on my
eyes but I definitely haven't done a few
swatches and this is so incredibly good
let's just do like let's just do one
just to show you guys I'm gonna go ahead
and grab the shade of redonkulous on my
middle finger we're just gonna do like
like you're kidding
it is so pigmented as Manny would say
I'm first gonna grab the shade okie
dokie on Miami for to fire brush and
just uses to it stuff the eyelid in
place to prepare for shadow so first
good our way I'm four for one and dip
into the shade bomb diggity and uses of
the transition okay whoa so those that
feel a little bit of kickback on the
shadow but I really don't mind that oh
that just means it's really pigmented so
hopefully this isn't like the Anasazi
have subculture poet but let's go to an
appliance see how it blends in oh yeah
okay whoa the shade of Lee wants out not
as vibrant as you see in the palette but
that is definitely not a negative for me
at all this shade looks absolutely
beautiful as a transition shade in the
eyelid crease and it is blending like
butter like that looks really really
good oh my god yes sister Laura I'm
Mexican to grab a clean M 4-3-3 brush
and dip into the shade of cray cray and
deepen up the crease a little bit you
guys have literally could not get over
how well these shades are blended
together like these are really really
good shadows that looks so good oh my
god
I'm next to me over another M 4-3-3
brush and dip into the shade at kookie
and use that once again to deepen up the
crease a little bit and prepare for the
eyelid shadow I'm honestly so shocked
right now like I was expecting this to
be good but like this eye look is
literally blending it sounds like you
guys are watching this all go down I'm
like whoa if you guys haven't noticed
it's actually really really rare for
makeup brands to include reds or Maroons
in their palettes because a red formula
is really really hard to perfect and
make it pigment in it to blend enough on
the eyes and the fact that Laura
included it in her first palette and
it's actually like really good is major
major points in my buck I can't even
tell you I am so so sick of having
palettes that are full of beautiful
beautiful oranges and there is not a
single red shade on that girl
I need the Maroons I need the friends I
need the cranberries and this palette is
honestly giving it to me so I'm living
for this for my lid I'm gonna grab a
flat Packer brush and dip into the shade
in one year in fact that on the lid and
I'm actually gonna grab some up Mac fix
actually you know what let's go ahead
and apply on the lid a dry person see
how that applies then use some fix glass
you're literally kidding this is already
so pretty and I haven't even wet it yeah
I'll immigrant more on that same brush
with my mac's fix+ and really pakka are
there to make it super metallic you hurt
kidding that looks absolutely stunning
just out of curiosity I'm also gonna
know a little bit of that on my finger
and try to apply it that way I might let
just see how it looks
wow this shade is absolutely beautiful
just add a little bit more dimension I'm
gonna grab a tiny fluffy brush this is
Miami 506 and dip into out the other oh
my god get it in one ear and out the
other
so freakin clever and I'm gonna use this
to deepen up the outer corner a little
bit for the newsn that stain brush I'm
gonna grab the littlest bit of the shade
oddball and really deep it out just that
I want auravie just to add some more
down and then to finish off the upper
lid I'm gonna go to Miami 5:13 at one
last time and dip right back to cry cry
and then I'm just going to buff out
those edges I love how this is turning
out oh my god for the lower lash then
I'm first gonna got my own for a 3/3
brush and the shade of Craig Craig and
just put in a light transition shade and
I always like to make sure especially in
this outer corner here that the lower
lash line and upper lash line shadow are
connected what my biggest puff piece
ever is when people have like a nice
sharp defined line right here to cut
that like outer shadow wing and then all
it's on the bottom lash line shadow
starts but they're not connected like
there's literally like a I just I really
hate how that looks next centigram I am
one tube for our brush and dip into the
shade Kuki and use this to hug my upper
or my lower lash line next I'll grab my
atom a 5 5 9 and dip into the shade at
quirky and use that to deep it up right
up at the lash line and then finally
describing a little tiny bit more of
oddball just to deepen up that very
outer corner to highlight the brow bone
I'm gonna grab the shade a scatterbrain
on just a flat packing brush and I
brought that on there oh wow I'm also
gonna play a little bit of that on the
inner corner as well okay I was gonna
save all my thoughts until the end of
the video but I'll just go ahead and say
it right now because I feel confident
and my answer that this palette from
Laura Lee Los Angeles the cat's pajamas
palette is so so good
I honestly was not expecting anything
less than really great for more but this
palette like really it's just beyond
great as you can see the shadows blend
so well together they are incredibly
we said if there would be one negative
thing about it that I would want to
mention is that some of the shadows do
have a lot of Fallout which I don't see
a personal problem with it that just
means a really pigmented if anything
just make sure you tap your brush before
you actually put it on or just make your
face you can wave everything away at the
end but like I said this palette ten out
of ten definitely assist sir James
recommended all right so I just went
ahead and I did the other eye off-camera
super quickly and that the eyes are both
done I'm gonna apply some lashes today
as always but I do have a new first
impressions today and those are the more
feet eyelashes I am obviously a morphe
affiliate you guys know that you can use
Koji short Empress amount or OB probox I
literally say all the time and even have
a hoodie with the setting on it also
check out says Georgia parallel comm for
all your sisters merch anyway all that
being said I was up the morphe office a
few weeks ago and i was like looking
through all their products and i was
like wait a second are those lashes and
one we hold morphe 'has lashes which i
literally did not even know about they
were not announced I just kind of came
to the store but they look beautiful
then I'm gonna be applying this ayah i
traction which look very very similar to
the house and lashes ikonics and they
are stunning so while I put on these
launch that I guess I will give you guys
the rundown I absolutely love how this
style looks especially with the shape of
the eye shadow that I went with today
the one thing that I will say about
these lashes that I don't love is the
actual band on them the style of lash is
beautiful but the band is really really
thin and flimsy now some people may like
that because it's really easy to like
kind of manipulate it but I personally
prefer a much thicker and more durable
band because I kind of feel like when
you come to glue it on it's a lot harder
to work with but I feel like that works
in the fact that it won't come off as
easy
whereas like now that we have a thin
band it's kind of just like flipping
around and I really had to make sure I
like how's it on there while gluing it
on at the end of the day it's really up
to personal preference I don't love this
lash band like I said but these lashes
are only retailing for $10 and with an
influencer code they are nine dollars so
it is much better than like a lily lash
or a new bouncing lash I just I love
them so you guys could totally make your
own decision on that but yeah these
lashes are beautiful just don't love the
band so those are both eyes all complete
I honestly love how the suck is turning
oh so far and then the eyes are done are
next up is going to be the glow and once
again for the glow I do have a first
impressions product and that is the
brand new Anasazi sugar glow
I think Anasazi basically chose all the
favorite highlighters from the
individual highlighter palettes before
and put them all together into one
palette what you think is absolute
genius it's like a favorites palette
within the actual prance about is super
super dope and I think I'm actually
going to go ahead and apply and mix of
the shades of butterscotch and starburst
today for this look that's always I'm
gonna play you some I am a 501 brush I
mean this really should come to no
surprises you guys we all know the
Anasazi always kill that their
highlighters I've been using so
Hollywood and literally every single
video for the past like almost two years
now but Wow
I'm sure these are so good
now that my highlight is all I don't
gonna grab my blush brush one more time
which is my e4 and dip into the shade
terracotta and breeze and just put a
little bit of this more on the
cheekbones just to kind of blend
together the highlight because I feel
like it is a little bit too pigmented
and it's not yeah that's a lot better
there we go I just completely didn't
finish my sentence it's a little bit too
pigmented and it's not blending together
for that maja for the lips today I'm
gonna play the ofra liquid lipstick in
the shade on a Lulu as a base this was
literally the perfect lip color to use
for this look oh my god I think I'm
actually gonna take my packing brush and
dip it back into the laurel leaf huh and
grab a little bit of porky and in one
ear together and make this lip metallic
okay well adding that shadow was like
literally the best idea ever this looks
so so pretty Emma's literally the
easiest way to make a DIY metallic
liquid lipstick
protip simple DIY if you ever have a
lipstick that dries down matte but you
want it to be metallic just put it on
let it dry down completely and then just
layer over top with a similar shade of
metallic eyeshadow and there you go
super easy and looks so so good and all
that being said this look is now
complete so let's go ahead and finish
off with a little spreads of Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray
alright guys and that is this fall first
impressions makeup look all complete I
absolutely love how this look turned out
and honestly I think I pretty much liked
almost every sync one of the products
we've tried today which is so exciting
starting over from the beginning the no
horrible um primer there we go that's a
mouthful from a touching soul was
absolutely wonderful it made my skin
feel so so good and super smooth
definitely did like a blurring effect
which I love next up we use the milk
makeup foundation and I was in the shade
golden light it was a really really good
match for my skin as you can see which
normally does not happen on the future
channel so that is great it wasn't my
favorite product in the world but it
also was my least favorite it looks
really really beautiful all the skin and
is honestly holding up really really
well till at least I have a little bit
of a problem start with us on my nose
which is like honestly a breaking point
for any foundation for me my nose
contour is super super important to me
and vital to my makeup routine so as
soon as a foundation it doesn't sit well
on my nose that is instantly out for me
but I feel like the pros of this
foundation are outweighing the cons so I
like it definitely try that for yourself
and let me know what you guys think next
up we use the Laura Lee Los Angeles
cat's pajamas eyes shadow palette and I
already told you guys what I think of
this this is so incredibly bomb it
launches on October 13 you guys have to
check this out one that comes out these
shadows girl Laura Lee Kelton let me
forget it once again but we also use the
Anastacio radiant blush palette and I
use the shade coastline and terrace and
breeze all together so literally three
out of the four shades of the palette I
really really like the firm of these
they blended beautifully the only thing
I will say is that they are super super
pigmented so if you check these out just
using a very very light hand because you
might be looking a little bit crazy we
also went in with the new honest cons
you have sugar lo can't which as you
guys know Anasazi always kills the
cloaca came and I use the shades of
butterscotch and starbursts today and I
love how the skull looks I mean
come on girl it's like so blinding
alright guys most of all the new product
