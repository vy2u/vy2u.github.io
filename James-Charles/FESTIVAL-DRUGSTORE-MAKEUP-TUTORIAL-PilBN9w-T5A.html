welcome back to my channel so personal
season is officially upon it you guys
have no friggin idea how excited I am
there are a ton of amazing events coming
up with a bunch of amazing artists I am
so freaking excited leave me a comment
down below tell me why your guys are uh
still season I firstly will be attending
Coachella we get to and all the sister
so in honor thought I thought I want to
sit down and film a vessel inspired
makeup look for you guys today however
my bank account was clearly crying
because I spent literally eighteen
million dollars on the ticket I thought
I would make this a drugstore makeup
trail playing that I have literally
never done as a channel before which is
so crazy but I thought it would be so
fun to hit up all the drug stores around
me and buy a ton of products and make
this kind of like a first impressions
video as well and this is the look that
I came up with but most of every single
thing on my face can be found at the
drugstore excited by one product but
algis not in the video it's a very very
long story and the glitter that I used
to find at the craft store so definitely
not thing you can find at CVS or
Walgreens but definitely the same at
price point
something said if you like this glittery
glam perfect for festival season and you
want to see how to created this look
make sure you keep on watching so I'm
like multiple other drones I'm going to
start there's a lot by doing my eyes
first there's going to be a lot like all
of the base and clearly Coachella is
like super crazy hot and really sweaty
so big really want to get the most
long-lasting and best we're out on our
foundations possible so I'm going to
start by going to the next micro eyebrow
pencil in the shade ash brown I'm just
filling in my brows like girl what I'm
going to keep them really light and
fluffy I don't want them to be like
super SuperDuper heavy instagrams their
brows because like I said Coachella is
crazy hot and crazy sweaty I'm just
going to fill them in as light as
possible just to kind of keep them
looking natural but still definitely
have a shape and arch to them filling in
my brows first is very very strange me
I'm so not used to do
I've never actually done my makeup
starting off on my eyebrows and whether
or not this ends up working out it's
going to be something that we're going
to figure out soon
that's to clean up the concealer
underneath my brows immunity and
maybelline fitme concealer and I wanted
shaded number of 20 which is sand and
I'm also filled with the same concealer
all the delays act as my shadow primer
and then we're going to rope us a little
bit of coding you're so clever with that
same fluffy brush and it's not that
eyelid concealer and please make sure it
does not crease or going on throughout
the day so resolved with the eyes that
couldn't really find a good at drones or
I shall announce I'm actually gonna
start by going to the stealth blossom
Talon and I'm going to use this orange
shade as my transition let's be honest
we all know the morphe brushes are not
so at the jokester but I figured if they
are like drugs or price and I think
nothing can really beat their based on
180 soldier to jumpstart so I just
wanted to feature that in this video at
the wings and you guys know these coded
change in terms of your purchase I said
it literally 84 million times but yes
I'm gonna be using normally in this
video
next we're going to play next
comfortable at night working on 433 and
deepen up the inner and outer corners
I'm going to just focus this shadow aka
contour club on the inner outer quote is
going to create like a halo eye
different situation on if you live next
during my era v 6u 4 more feet
underground the darker shade in the
palette under stretches even up once
again the inner outer corner with
analyzed every time we add more of a
color always make sure to go back in
with a blending brush and just make sure
that really really is blended out I'd
like to build another thing but it's
just putting a report that contribute
you are continuously blowing alter on
please situation or everything
even be like transitioning together for
the greater the add-on River group is
elf liquid gold shadow swatches and oh
my god it is looking so beautiful so I'm
just going to pop this right on this
around the lid to create an finish on my
fatal eye effect
notice the upper blade shadows all
complete I'm going to pop on these
lashes from Iowa in collaboration with
Nicole Guerrero I freaking love her and
these are very very similar to the
health of Asha psychotic so they're
perfect for my eye shape and I already
know they're going to look at that and
once that lasts all pop out I'm going to
go to my covergirl so lashing mascara
this obviously has a very very special
place in my heart I was on the campaign
for this and it's a Baba's mascara I'm
just going to go in and blend the lashes
with the falsies all right now since
they get top of what is all completed
this is very very strange for me to do
it in this order I'm going to go into
the other eye off-camera that we will
come back and do the rest of the face
and then the bottom eye this is so weird
be right back
none of the eyes are both complete
before I start off the base of an
appropriate makeup wipe and I'm just
going to clean up the edge of
today's three autumn using the Loreal
Pro goal and the Shane at 2:08 I've
never tried this before but I've heard
this amazing foundation so I have second
fitted to and get it on and get the glow
on let's go apply the spike ages in a
damp Beauty Blender I know a lot of all
of the Real Techniques Beauty Blender
and I was looking for as the dresser and
I could not find it so I am to be using
a regular beauty blender I'm so sorry
this is not saucer but I feel like DVD
blender is like a staple beauty item
cycling most you guys probably have it
there's going to be one thing that you
Stephanie you splurge on I would say OBE
at the Beauty Blender for sure
I have really really sensitive skin so
lighter tan I just burn ridiculously
it's like so bad so I get Charlie out
straightening of the weeks ago with
sister of the world before our occasion
together and I absolutely loved it so I
did it not going back and getting
another one I did just get it a few
hours ago so it is very very fresh and
it's super dark it definitely will
lighten up after a few showers so do not
be alarmed I also have on the same stuff
that is wearing on today was Sarah which
is the melody mailed gleam scam stuff I
cannot emphasize how amazing to
something it's definitely not drugs or
what enemies and she did send it to me
but this stuff it's like so beautiful
it's like liquid highlighter for your
entire body and I have it on right now
as you can see I am gleaming and I would
definitely will be wearing a cockroach
allies like it just hits the light so
nicely and just gives you that like
godly glow or consider to have any of
the Maybelline fit me wants to get in
the shade at number 20 just to conceal
it right underneath my eyes I'm also
going to ring this right onto my nose
bridge just to free up smash the nose
and when I go up here I'm going to go
right up against the eyeshadow line
set on the floor on one line right down
to the no but one thing I'm gonna call
my a pity but I just blend that out like
I said once I get up to the side I'm
gonna really really carefully and
lightly tap it in just to clean up the I
shine a little bit more before I go on
with anything else I'm good with my
morphe 45 in my up Cody or some powder
and really lightly sat underneath my
eyes just make sure there's no creasing
I'm also going to really lightly top
this powder into a my nose and then on
my forehead because I do tend to get
really really layer increasing but for
the most I'm going to leave as my face
is doing now the way I know Rhys nose
and forehead is set and rest my face is
drawing down I'm just and a way to
finish off the eyes because it feels
very very strange to not have a full
eyes on I don't really like it it's
going to finish up that make you move on
with like everything else you feel sober
starts off with my um 4-3-3 dipping back
into that orange blush shade and I'm
just going to put this with the
transition shade underneath my eye and
I'm going to make sure it's a nice to
show up to the top lash line as well
continuing on with the halo that I'm
going to grab my m14 night and the
darkest shade from the contour palette
and I'm just going to start by darkening
out the outer and inner corner then stir
my M 507 I'm going to make sure it's
really blended out
once again I'm going to round that out
like what I shadow and I'm going to pop
it right in the center of the lower
lashline someone like the upper lashline
once that's on there I'm just going to
go back in with the medium brown color
one of the water tones and just make
sure that you're very very blended
together alright now that the shadow is
off of Lee I'm going to go in with the
NYX wonder pencil and I'm going to line
my waterline with that this just really
helps to open up the eyes make them look
very very large and in charge now I did
have a really light layer of mascara for
a reason because I had something else -
the lower lash line I went ahead and
bought these are gel with these number
600 and I'm going to glue a few Z's onto
the lower lash line just to make the
eyes look really pretty this is a
technique that I learned from my
favorite makeup on it on Twitter her
using is sleek by Aaliyah she always
does in her eyes look so beautiful so I
thought we wouldn't try it out today I'm
just going to take one of these lashes
and I'm going to cut it right in half
and then take each one of these four and
then cut those as well going in with the
second two largest lost from that band
and a little bit of last lone pair of
tweezers I'm just going to pop this
right underneath the center of the eye
grabbing the next smaller one I'm going
to pop this on at the outer third
and then gargy the smallest one I'm
going to process right on in the inner
corner now that the eyes all go bleep
find that this is in such a weird
freaking order I'm going to go in and
I'm going to highly and bronze and
contour my face Gibran's okay so I'm
going to go to my morphe r7 brush in my
wet and wild
bikini contest bronzer I want to be a
super-duper bronze the focus really is
like with young contouring much today I
just wanna look glowy Lee huh
bronze goddess okay I'm just gonna grab
my I'm a 405 from morphe and this light
bronze contour shade from the NYX
palette I just check out my cheekbones a
tiniest bit
I'm next out of my busty beauty at 1:31
brush limit chisel out my nose with
index contour palette whoa this has a
lot of reflection that is a problem
Oh No with that same brush I'm gonna
grab the light yellow powder from the
next contour palette and I want your
bugs on besides we know to hopefully
build on the color a little bit and
appear as though my nose going to be
lifted so they come back to day one but
not my kind of noise and then for blush
I'm going to grab my Amis Bible knife
for more feet and once again that orange
shade from the elf blush palette and
just dust this on at my cheeks oh well
that's really pretty
oh my god I love that oh well now that
the contours are all in place I'm not
really going to bake my face but I am
petal just a little bit of translucent
powder just to kind of enhance them and
carve out a little bit but I'm not going
to talk on a ton of powder like I said
we really want to be a Subaru dewy today
I'm gonna let this Finn please for a
little bit just to kind of cook up make
sure everything is super defined and
while we sit in place I'm going to go
ahead and highlight my face now this is
the part that I've been dreading at
doing on-camera for you guys because I'm
so sad to say that I do not have a
drugstore highlighter to use to the
tutorial listen I know the one wild ones
are so bomb I was looking everywhere we
looked at four different drugstores and
this is the only one I could find and
clearly this blue and purple highlight
is not exactly going to work before this
look today so I'm going to be using the
Laura Geller gilded honey highlighter I
am NOT drugstore and I know that's
definitely not cheap either but I do
need a golden glow so if you can find
the one wild one at the drugs are
definitely go for that one or anything
on this or this is literally the only
one I could find so I'm going to be
using this one today so sorry guys
please don't kill me I'm going to do
first up on my morphe Emma 501 brush and
swirl it around I really want to be a
glowing for the guys and then I'm going
to spread my brush using my wet and wild
focus setting fresh this will just make
something that really really really
metallics and super black
we're also going to Justice write a
mullet to ferrell bone without seeing
develop in my sigma e30 brush I'm going
to anticipate and I'm just going to use
this to highlight my nose bridge and the
inner corners but let's say I'm going to
go in the white and wild lips lipstick
in the shade camee mocha I am so good to
try this out because sister toddy said
they're amazing and anything toxic says
is amazing is definitely amazing so I
want to use on my face ASAP
better stuff to let someone to go back
into the tiny bit of that elf liquid at
shadow I'm going to carbon angle brush
and just draw a tiny little line down
the bottom line bottom left
once that's how I'm going to go to Maya
and while setting Freight once again in
Santa Fe we definitely want to use a lot
of this because if we were wearing this
to Coachella it's going to be super hot
crazy sweaters you really make sure this
locks in place and stays on all day long
now the makeup look is complete and you
could totally stop here and wear this to
another festival you are planning on
attending this season but you guys know
me and I wanted to be just a little bit
extra today so we're going to turn this
video from a drugstore makeup video to a
cross de mariscos video so I went and
picked up some different signs of gold
glitter Selma Michael's craft store and
I'm going to be cleaning on it my face
just on the highlight areas just like
shine bright and house everybody shucks
to the corner to put these all I'm going
to square my face using it once again my
setting spray and then I'm just going to
dab it on with my I'm 501 and they
should stay
and this for the chunker glitter I'm
just going to grab lash glue and just
darlana some duct and then a press them
on all right sisters and this is the
completed festival inspired glittery
glam for today with so much fun today -
sit down - and all these drugstore
products obviously I could play with
covergirl selves all the time and I love
that but it was so much fun to
experiment and branched out with other
brands as well and it's so closer to see
that all these brands are absolutely
killing it with their product and
there's so many good stuff out there for
a lower budget than all the Suffolk
Sephora stop being sent if you guys
enjoy this video please don't forget to
give it a big thumbs up down below if

times week on Tuesdays and Fridays I
