back to my youtube channel as you can
see I'm looking very very different
right now I don't know a baseball cap on
I have got my freaking hair client haha
I Asli mustered out my Erasmus of a man
bun is now chopped off
thank the Lord and heaven above god
bless major living legend Jen Atkin if
you guys don't know if she actually
sells the Kardashians and a ton of other
amazing celebrities but she doesn't do
boycotts that often and her eye we're
talking were like girl I need to get
this off my head I'm so tired of looking
ugly every day where's my baseball hat
and my messy out there like what can we
do and she was like sister Jane I got
you so I went to the salon and this is
what came out of it honestly I'm so
happy with it I hope you guys love it
too
there will not be a baseball hat for a
little bit of time now so hopefully we
can get used to the new look and yeah
moving right along for today's video
we're going to be doing a first
impression chit chat get ready with me
I'm actually super comfort because you
guys know that I really don't change up
my maker between not often to toys the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
stick shaped ape concealer Laura Mercier
and benefit brawl stop save tape on the
brows and some type of more bi shadow
palette some type of highlighter and
then a nude lip like you guys feel me at
this point although I do love to again
some creative looks it's been a hot
minute I've tried to brand new a cock
all that being said I've been saving up
some PR packages from the last few weeks
of some my favorite companies and I have
a ton of products that I cannot wait to
show you guys so let's get started
as always I'll describe my face using my
benefit Porefessional primer you guys
know just like my ride-or-die primer and
they're probably will honestly never
switched up unless I find something
better skin is always something that
just like a major problem area for me in
my life I used to have really bad acne
but they leave my skin is between me so
so well and I am so freakin happy about
it so yeah Porefessional it is I
actually just had a facial a few days
ago for the first time when they did
like these shocks and so they said
they're like pop everything out of your
nose I was laughing so hard because the
only thought was go ahead was literally
you could probably pop all the
blackheads on my nose and literally
repackage all the gunk into a pensive or
brush no primer because that's all I
ever felt my frickin bone formation to
them use my makeup for ever ultra HD
sick in the shade of Y at 325 once
and one of those products that is my
Holy Grail and will not change and there
was no what foundations with any of the
packages that I received so cancerous
anything up I'm so freaking excited
because you know all the sisters are
going with makeup forever tied to a
kailani concert here in Los Angeles and
I absolutely love her and her music I
think she's so talented and just so like
cool in general we actually just got a
text earlier thinking we're going to get
to hang out with her before the show is
something which is literally so dope so
I am getting ready for that right now
I'm praying that all these products that
I'm trying on say work well my favorite
because it is gonna be the look that I'm
wearing tonight you almost have that
something's going to be iconic so
hopefully we can pull this off all right
so I just went ahead and applied my
shape tape concealer in the shade light
and then blended it out as usual my damp
Beauty Blender and now the next episodes
to set my face so for today I am using a
new setting powder and this is the RCM a
no color powder you may have seen this
before because I know a lot of people
talk about and if used it if you've used
it I apologize this is not your first
impressions as my first impressions and
I have never tried this before so I'm
going to use it today you guys know that
setting powder is a little bit of a
touchy subject for me so I'm actually
super nervous to try a new one but I've
heard a lot of good reviews so let's go
ahead and give it a try
so first science is going on really
really nicely it definitely is like
pretty finely milled so that's good
because we don't get those like ugly
like splotches that sometimes it catches
on to the foundation but I'm going to
keep putting it on and see when I think
empty and it's definitely doing a really
good job of like modifying and setting
everything in place as you can see my
nose
definitely looks locked right and then
which is great because lord knows and my
nose loves to slip and slide around I'm
just looking to place a little bit of
this joint in the center of my forehead
just to set not Arion place to make sure
don't get any creases because I do tend
to crease up there a lot and then
lightly just dab so the excess powder on
the face
Lizzie I actually have not been setting
my entire face I've been going for more
of the like a dewy skin a foundation
look and I've honestly been loving it
here's Los Angeles at this literally
it's so freaking hot I've had my AC
blasting all morning and all night last
night and it's still it's like a million
degrees in here which is very very very
homophobic because I'm about to melt but
we're going to make it work I'm going to
suck it up but yeah I haven't been
setting my entire face and I've been
living
we do we look but by depends on your
skin type and how you lay for your
makeup if you want to set your makeup
and if you're someone who definitely
gets oily definitely a pack of the
powder girl you do you so not only face
is all set and lost right in place the
next person pressures I want to pull is
actually a brush that Oh James Charles
not using morphe brushes relax bitch you
know that the jacket he'll Murphy Club
is coming in about five seconds hold up
today I want to show you guys the clouds
that I have a super duper excited button
is actually when my best friends and
true sisters in the entire world hey
Zeus and his club with the makeup shock
I am so beyond excited to this and I
have been with him since the entire
beginning of this even being planned in
the first day so I'm so excited to have
it right here inside of me and I
definitely will be using these brushes
on my face today on the back of the
palace
I have created this brush that also my
personal favorite brushes on the makeup
shock to create a full face for the
everyday glam a combination of natural
and synthetic brushes I hope you enjoyed
these as much as I do
xoxo hey Zeus Gomez I am so freaking
proud of them this set comes my brushes
in their annual brushes I brushes
compact brushes and then face brushes as
well so definitely a full on that I know
retail for $75 at the makeup track which
is definitely a little pricey for a
brush set but y'all know me of course
every stylist and I did get a coupon
code so you guys can now use code J's or
credit for softer purchase at the makeup
shock that brings the pipes of this down
to around $60 and divided by nine that's
just over six dollars per brush so
definitely not too bad of a deal sort
off of when we grab the t27 brush from
the brush set and then dip into my Kat
Von D shade light palette into this
middle shade and I'm going to contour
and chisel out my face oh my god the
rest of the news are so soft
Wow legend went on we got a customer out
that jaw line as well and snatch her
right up and we definitely are not going
to miss out on this for that contour
Lord and nose and now that I don't have
a baseball hat to confer half of its
region we're going to need to use that
contour to turn that 5 head back into
around a 3 head I'm then going to grab
the t-84 Russian that same shape in the
shade and light palette I'm going to
contour out my nose oh my god that
actually lay down the color so nicely
my lucky 182 Brust is shaking we're
going to actually really like this yes
294 you better work before we move on to
baby I'm going to quickly grab my t17
also from the brush set and dip in join
Peter's blush and just put a light wash
of color on the cheekbone
okay maybe that was exactly the best
brush for a light to wash a color but
it'll do
alright I'm going to grab my Beauty
Blender and dip right back into that RCM
a no color powder and I'm going to see
my face I'm going to line there with
contour as always even though those
other instruments that I'm really hoping
that because it's white it's still will
brighten up everything a little bit and
if it does we're about to look so snatch
in a few minutes and I was super fitter
to see how this rubs off alright so
while I was in the oven baking I just
quickly went ahead and do my brows
off-camera save some time same exact
process as always no new products or
first impression so now that it's been a
long pier logically time we're going to
go ahead and we're going to wipe this
baked off and see how this powder did
okay so I was definitely right the
fastener is white definitely did leave a
little bit of a highlighted book but I
really really like that that's exactly
what I look for in a setting powder I
really like when I bake my face and it
like really brings back those highlights
then you have the very very defined
contour highly like very very full focus
360 full glam smash tellest stupid I
apologize you know what I mean looking
up close my skin definitely does a
little bit more porous than usual
especially like the t-zone area right up
in here
that's where pores are usually the worst
but it definitely doesn't look as good
as a little yesterday
I'm not sure if that's the powder or my
skin in general and not how many good
skin days but I doesn't want to keep
using this powder because I like how it
looks so far and I will keep you guys
posted at for sure
alright sorry went ahead and prime my
eyelids using my shape tape concealer
and then the more honesty made of solid
powder as usual and now we're going to
move on to the eyes and this is what I'm
so so so excited for and that is the
jacqueline do a collaboration with
morphe nuts this was actually released i
can actually spell a little bit of a
secret realize but a long long long time
ago jacqueline actually showed me the
box for this palette on FaceTime to show
me like one of the first time regions
and honestly it has changed so much
since then but it is just so beyond
beautiful Joplin if you are watching
this I freaking love you so much I don't
know if any of you guys know this
because the only toward list or like
once or 20 but Japanese knows actually
like the reason I started doing makeup
in the first place she's holding my
inspiration I would stay up all night
watching your YouTube videos I just
think she's just like the most badass
bitch
I loved her letter Spectre so much and
obviously you guys know I love Murphy as
well so this club which is made in
heaven and if you know Jacqueline you
know that this is literally her in a
second a palette version so this palette
comes with 35 custom formulated shades
they are not the everyday more people
and I have not watched them yet but I've
seen other people I know that these are
going to be good that I'm going to save
my opinions until I actually put them
clubmate babe
that being said this palette retails for
$35 so it is a little bit deeper than
working as usual $22 a palette but it's
living 35 amazing shades for $35 you
really really to not be that this
palette well just in a few days so you
definitely going to want it hands on it
while you can and always you can use
coche sort em to someone for purchase
but this is Johnson's health so if you
want to double support her please use
code a Jack Attack as well that as
Jacqueline's : I'll put it right down
here on the screen go show her some love
this palette is literally everything and
I'm so pumped to put it on my face right
now I'm first gonna start by grabbing
the shaded creamsicle on my makeup shock
she's 70 brush and I'm just going to
buff this right into the crease oh my
god I picked it okay Josh and I see you
sir I'm messing to grab the shade hunt
on my makeup shock of t44 brush and I'm
going to block this right into the
crease because I'm going to be
transitioning from like yellow to orange
to a red oh my god these colors are
literally blending it's so beautifully
I'm kind of stuck to the coil right now
I'm Exeter Graham I p63 brush the dip
into the shade Jack's and I'm going to
put this right in that crease for a
little pop of red okay we can knock it
over helped a bunch of these shadows are
that was really one dip into the pan and
we got cat-like high okay I'm going to
dip back into hunt with that K 44 brush
and this bubble of those edges I was not
anticipating that much pigmentation so
now we need to blend her out or else is
going to get real messy real fast once
all those three colors are on there as
well I'm going to get back into
creamsicle and just go over those edges
to make sure they are super blended out
and their transitions are all smooth I
really want to do the pop of blue on the
eye so with that same exact g63 brush
I'm actually going to dip into the shade
on royalty which is a metallic purple
shade in this palette but I'm going to
use this as kind of a transition shade
between the metallic blue that's going
to go on the lid and the cranberry
colors I just went in the crease and
once it's all then I'm going to go back
into the same brush in the shade Jack's
which is the red shade and just bring
the cranberry color I'm going to grab my
teeth 79 Russian didn't do the shade of
torque which is this metallic blue shade
I am so excited for this and I'm going
to pop her right up to the lid oh my god
my brush literally is not even wet
either miss Hill suddenly my wake just
got ripped off and flew all the way from
Los Angels to wherever you are in
Florida these are so bad I know
everybody's gonna say I'm sucking up so
early because I always do but honestly
the shadows are like so good I generally
would not expect anything less than
perfect from gentleman and so far that
is exactly what I'm seeing okay go back
in with tornado sprites my brush using
the all-nighter and I'm just going to
lay it on top again and see how like
actual metallic we can get it oh my god
these are literally beautiful okay I
think I want to turn this into a little
bit of a halo eye situation so I'm going
to grab the same exact brush and dip
into the slightest bit of pool parties
once again I'm going to spread that
brush and I'm just going to layer that
right on the center of the lid and see
how that looks
I'm livin lovin huh both look so far so
I guess we're going to move on to the
lower lash line now I'm going to start
off using the exact same shade at work
on the same t79 brush and I'm going to
buff it into the inner and outer
fullness of my lower lash line and then
going to grab a pool party and pop that
in the center once again then I got that
t44 brush one last time and dip into
jazz whatever is going to blend all
those edges and connect it back up to
the upper lash line highlight the inner
corners vinegar my Sigma e30 brush and
dip into the shade and key which is this
beautiful bright out highlighting shade
and I'm going to pop that right in there
oh wow but why move on to the lashline
just grab my Mac reflux teal because I
want the center of the lid to really
really really pop so I'm just going to
grab my OT at 79 brush one last time dip
into just delighted little bit of it and
I'm going to stretch my brush then I'm
just going to offer on there that is
everything that is that I shadow all
complete for lash day I'm going to pop
on the makeup shock lashes in the style
Dubai I'm having a really good makeup
day today and I am honestly really sick
about it
and then of course we need my roller
lash mascara just to blend together the
fake lashes with the real one all right
sisters notice when I all complete I'm
honestly loving this looks so much so
far it is definitely a good makeup day
so it's sister James and happy I'm going
to go ahead do you other one off camera
quickly I'll be right back to finish off
the rest of the face alright guys I am
at the bullfights all complete I wiped
off the
the foundation on my left first ladies
to get ready to go for tonight's event
and now let's move on with the glow for
highlighted and weaving the wet and wild
mega lo highlighting powder I am so
freaking excited because I've heard so
many great things about these but
they're literally sold out everywhere
I've looked at them so many times with
my different drugstores you guys know
fried drugstore makeup store a few weeks
ago I was talking about wanting to use
these but they were nowhere to be found
so I finally got this one today actually
has a matter of fact wet and wild just
having a huge PR package with a ton of
the product so definitely give this
video a big thumbs up down below if you
want me to do a full face using only one
lot of products because I would
definitely be in definitely God is
blinding if I was expecting but not Bob
to formula definitely grody my brush and
it feels extremely soft which is good
because that means the texture of your
natural face socialize much criminal
highly a lot of times accentuate texture
especially for me cuz I have a lot of
pimples in my hair region for some
annoying ass reason but the form of this
feels really really good the tile is
simply really really pretty and I know
this is short surprise I think this is
like $6 so honestly for $6 it's really
really not that I'm just being dramatic
here but definitely not as blinding as I
was expecting it to be I'm probably
going to end up wearing this with like
my makeup forever 13 Sigma or my Anasazi
so Hollywood just to be like blind
people left and right but definitely so
beautiful for the price I said that
soliders beautiful and I did not lie and
is definitely beautiful on the
cheekbones but for the nose contour haha
for some reason even though the tele is
literally super super light and it's
apparently too dark for my skin tone
because when I'm not hitting the light
like right there you can see it's not
reflecting light so it looks a little
bit darker than my nose contour which
was really remove the effect which is so
frustrating I'm missing a layer over top
the makeup over 13 right on that area
because lord knows a dot is that the
lining and hopefully success oh great
that literally just eight of 20 times
worse I think it's probably a message
from somebody up about same team it's
not going to make your nose look 20 some
sore that actually is because sister
you're not fooling anybody are the last
time of this makeup shows obviously
going to beat the liquidy doodahs and
for this I do have a first impressions
new product and that is the brain news
away high pigment lip glosses
I love joy Aylor highlighters are so
bomb and I love their lip top
as well so I was so excited to see their
brand new glasses these are all that
will light up in here under the Li box
because there are a whole lot of them
for Schubert for this one I'm gonna pop
on the shade at PCH alright so at the
base I disciplines the colour-pop ultra
satin lip and shade Aquarius just to
give the gloss something to like stick
to a layer over top of and I was going
to reapply to show you that PCH I love
how that looks oh my god Patricia
giggling I think over top and layered is
you a a skinny dip lip topper just for
some extra glow some glam some shine why
not
lastly to finish off that stick I'm just
going to dredge my face using the Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray alright
guys this is the completed full think
using all first impressions glam imma
honnestly so alive for this look I love
it
so freakin much so let's go back
interview all the times that we tried
today's the first up being the our seem
a no color powder this definite it a
really good job of basing to face
enlightening it up I love the affected
agate but it definitely did make my
pores and texture look not the best that
I've ever looked
usually the Elora Mercier powder doesn't
really examples to leak everything out
like this is going to give this another
shot and see if it's just the powder or
if it is just my skin don't know it
looks pretty but I've seen it look
better so I'm quite sure definite all
the sense with this one but did a decent
job for today as for the makeup shocks
brushes they're definitely a big hit for
me you guys know that I'm very very
loyal to morphe as a brushes don't
absolutely love them but I have to sort
my best work in the entire world Hayes's
I am so freaking proud of you and you
guys need to go check out this brush
that has been hasn't launched it and
remember code James gives you 20% off
after the next item on the list you
already know how I feel about miss bitch
over here this whole is literally
everything I am just so beyond check up
with quality and how they blended and
just the pigmentation in general this
palette is a hundred percent a way as I
said before I am so beyond proud of
sister Jacqueline she is the person who
single-handedly got me into the beat
industry I've always looked up to her
and now it is literally so friggin crazy
and cool to me that I'm able to calm
when my best friend so proud of you as I
said before coach James get you 10% off
when it launches or if you want to
double support sister Jocelyn you go
Jack Attack at your checkout as well
next up on the list was the Wet n Wild
highlighting powder and I wanted to love
this so so so so bad but I think this is
going to be my one fail of this video
oh it looks so beautiful on the cheek
I'm like the brow bone and the upper
forehead region but on the nose contour
it is really not doing it justice it
definitely is a little bit too dark for
skin which is so strange because this is
already a super super light highlighter
but it is giving us that great on the
light isn't hitting it so this is going
to be a fail for me but like I said
before definitely give this video a big
thumbs up if you want to see a full face
using all wet and wild products because
I do have a full collection now that I
would love to try out for you guys and
last but certainly not least was easy
ways new ultra pigmented lip glosses and
these are so far I used to say to PCH on
my lips today once again layer over that
colour-pop gloss but I absolutely love
how it look the formula is really really
nice I know a lot of blogs oftentimes
they're really tacky or sticky when I go
like that my lips like stick together
but this wear beautifully it's
lightweight it's simple it's nice and I
love the color so this is definitely a
win it for me alright guys that is all I
have I had so much fun trying out all
these new products today definitely
leave a comment down below and tell me
which one of these that you'd be dying
to try I know there are so many launches
