shopping carts nothing time to kill from
hi guys it's James I'm sorry I've been
absent for a few days I've been super
sick but I'm finally feeling a little
bit better despite the fact that I still
can't breathe out of both my nostrils
but you know what we're going to make it
work
I figured I do a foundation in base
routine today just so it'll be easier
later on when I make more video so I
could just like them all back to here
instead of having to do the same thing
every single time if you want to know
how to recreate this everyday makeup
look and foundation base make sure to
keep on watching I'm starting off by
priming my face using my benefit
Porefessional primer it's literally my
favorite primer of all time and it
smooths out my skin so much which is
great because I have a million bumps and
I'm a teenager who gets pimples and
blackheads and all sorts of gross things
on every so for my foundation base today
I'm going to be using my Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation in the shade Y
255 I'm just going to be applying it
with my Beauty Blender and creating
little dots all over my face normally I
would color cracked my face before this
but I just shaved this morning and I got
a decent amount of sleep last night so
not feeling too blue today so I guess
we're just going to go right in now
normally I've gone with my concealer but
a few days ago I accidentally used um my
client foundation on my under eyes as a
concealer and it actually worked so well
so today I'm gonna be using my L'Oreal
True Match
in the shade shadow and one under my
eyes to highlight today as you can do
that just provided me with a really nice
under-eye highlight and it doesn't look
super crusty and gross and it's not
really creasing either so maybe I'll
start using this more often now that we
live like Casper the Friendly Ghost I'm
going to go ahead and set my entire face
using my cody airspun powder this powder
is so good and it's a really nice
alternative to the Laura Mercier powder
and it's literally like seven bucks from
Walmart so that they would recommend now
I'm going in with my morphe 48 brush
it's just a really nice tapered powder
brush and I'm going to pack this light
shade under
my eyes to further highlight to contour
today I'm going to go in with my benefit
hoola bronzer it says James's Huell on
it how freaking cute the benefit has the
best packaging I swear
so to contour my face today I'm going to
be using my morphe m-52 3 brush I'm also
just going into contour and bronze my
forehead because it's humongous so it'll
tear smaller hopefully fingers crossed
now to warm up my contour a little bit
more I'm going to be going in with
makeup geek Coco bear my cheekbones are
very high up so I don't really have
enough room in my face for contour blush
and highlighter so I usually just give
up on the blush I don't really like how
it looks on me this really helps to warm
it up and make me not look dead now I'm
just going to go back into like holy err
some powder and a powder puff just to
bake my contour so I can get a really a
nice defined line while I'm baking in
the oven at 350 I'm going to zoom you
guys in so we can do our brows together
I'm using my morphe be 74 in my Anasazi
a dip brow and the shady dat soft brown
I'm going to start in the middle of my
brow and just start drawing a little
flick 'ti lines once I get to the tail
I'm just going to do a little little
flick same thing again with the top I'm
just starting in the middle of my brow
rather than the front I'm going to
connect those two lines and once again
with the excess product I'm just going
back in and defining the inner corner
okay yes I realized these brow clips are
an absolutely horrible angle I'm really
sorry I'm still trying to figure out how
to do this whole thing please just bear
with me I promise I'm coming out with a
full brow tutorial soon so stay tuned
now that I have the basic shape I'm
going to go into my la girl Pro
concealer and a lot to find a brush just
to carve them out
and once I have the bottom of that brow
card out I'm just going to go ahead and
blend it down so there isn't a super
harsh line once we have that all done
I'm going to go in with my Anastasia
tinted brow gel in the shade espresso
just to set all my brow hairs in place
so they don't go flying throughout the
day and that guys is a finished proud
I'm going to go ahead and do the other
one off-camera then we can continue with
the rest of the face now that I finished
my brows I'm just going to go ahead and
wipe off my bake with my morphe 34 brush
and let just days it really defined and
nice so it's not a straight line when
it's cut I'm not going to do any
eyeshadow with this just because this is
my base tutorial and I'll be doing our
shadow looks with this later on
obviously but I'm going to go with my
mascara I'm going to be using benefit
roller lash today it's my Holy Grail
mascara for my highlight today I'm going
to be using my honest Asya cloak it and
not glow I'm going to be dipping into
the shade dripping in gold I'm going to
spritz my brush with just some benefit
hydrating mist when you wet your brush
before doing your highlighter it makes
it super vibrant and intense so helpful
hint I'm just highlighting my nose
bridge and Cupid's bow as well for my
lips today I think I'm going to go in
with Oprah Pasadena it's I'm just a
really nice nude shade obviously I will
change this depending on what look I'm
doing but for everyday look it's super
wearable I do have a coupon code with
over two if you use the code Jade
Charles at checkout you'll get 30% off
you're welcome
and that guys is the finished look this
is just a really good everyday makeup
look but it's also my base routine it's
what I do for all my looks aside from
the lips and eye shadow obviously but if
you want to ever create any way looks
this is what you should start off with
you guys have all been asked me how I do
my fake freckles as well so stay tuned
on Thursday I'll be uploading a video
tutorial on how to do them it'll be
super easy and quick but hopefully it'll
help you guys out if you guys did enjoy
