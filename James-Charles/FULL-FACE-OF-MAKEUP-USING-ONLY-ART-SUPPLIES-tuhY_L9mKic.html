back to my youtube channel you guys for
today's video I am a little bit doing
something that I've wanted to do for so
long now this has been on my video ID
list for like a million years I don't
know why I've never gotten to it I think
I've been too scared of the idea but you
know what I love a good sister challenge
and for today's video I went to Hobby
Lobby of Michaels every craft store I
could possibly find and I'm gonna be
getting a fully ready hopefully using
all art supplies at this point I think I
am a little bit a broken record was
saying like oh my god I started doing
makeup for the are we gonna James you
think you're talented who art has always
been a huge huge huge passion of mine
and it's what got me into makeup but
even before doing makeup I was always
drawing always painting always coloring
to a lot of the materials they have here
in front of me such as chalk pastels
paint brushes watercolors face paint and
sponges I am definitely not a stranger
to but they usually do not go on the
face I think this we are really fun and
potentially dangerous challenge
hopefully I don't get a break out from
using this stuff on my face but you know
what that's why it's called a challenge
I got without further ado let's jump
right into the video for foundation
today I got this tempera paint by upon
reading the label that says warning not
safe for consumption can cause cancer
great so this is not happening today I'm
just gonna use my normal foundation and
powder but I did find these natural fine
sponges at the craft store so Beauty
Blender never heard of her
we're gonna use a natural fine sponge
today I just went ahead and dampened and
then wrong on my Beauty sponges in the
sink I'm gonna grab my two-faced for
this way in the shade a warm nude you
guys know this my all-time favorite and
I'm gonna put it on my artiste palette
today when I think of artists why I was
like the first thing to come to mind a
little French man with a beret and a
little mustache painting it a little
easel we wait I am an artiste
okay first foundation brush today I'm
gonna use this one an actual paint brush
and I'm going to get my little palette
and brush it on oh the brush and then
apply it to the canvas oh my god low-key
want to supply really really nicely
hello what's going on - my fellow beauty
gurus out there who may be watching this
video I don't ever want to hear a single
one of y'all ever say
I'm just gonna paint this on until using
an actual paintbrush surprisingly this
is like not that Bob can't forget to
blend down the neck that I'm just gonna
take one of my own natural blending
sponges and dip it into the access
product on at the pallet and use that to
kind of stipple it end oh my god this is
kind of working Picasso is gonna be
trembling in his grave can I say that is
that offensive for concealer of course
they're gonna grab my tart shave tape
and this is in the shade light neutral
and I'm gonna put it o want my little
pale ain't I need to stop doing about
right now and then to apply I'm gonna
use this filbert 8 brush this literally
looks like a more PM 2 to 4
conspiracy-theory morphe brushes are
just artist brushes repackage whoa
low-key why is this brush like really
good this is doc really staying in my
collection for hot dog creases you've
got to be kidding me
okay once again beauty sponge to blend
it all out now that my face is all set
in place I'm going to set it using
another natural sponge and then it's the
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
this I'm actually scared about okay I'll
sit in there oh God
so now that we have the base all down in
set in place we can finally start
building on top of it using our art
supplies so for contouring I think I'm
gonna go into this 48 colors soft chalk
pastels kit and hopefully find a warm
tone a contour shade in here if I can
get this open okay so we have our two
sets of pastels right here the way it
was packaged but it looks like there
were more inside and they're not so our
contour options here are very very
limited as you can tell the only two
shades that may help us out are this a
very very bright burnt orange and this
very very dark brown this could be where
it goes back to cause my face today I'm
going to use this masters touch oil and
acrylic
number 430 round mop brush once again
morphe is there something you're not
telling us okay maybe if I like scrape
off oh my god
some of the pigment oh there we go okay
there's my word bingo we've cracked the
code ladies I'm just gonna scrape off a
little bit of the
burnt orange shade as wells we have like
a blush situation gonna grab my around
mop brush and dip into those two
pigments tap off the excess and
hopefully wow a benefit hoola bronzer
whoo Kat Von D shade and light palette
whoo Anasazi Beverly Hills contour kit
never heard of her
okay clearly we're going for a beachy
sunkissed look today that's what we're
going for yes correct
I obviously love that I'm complaining
about my face being orange when I just
used this to contour oh god I'm gonna
attempt to contour and snatch my nose
instead of using me once again oil
acrylic 425
Obul mop brush once again this is
literally a fluffy crease brush what is
going on say a silent prayer for me on
this one
oh okay not the worst but definitely not
the best I'm gonna grab some more chose
as a setting powder and another natural
sponge and just use this to bake my face
to not only lock everything in place but
also hopefully bring back a little bit
of my natural skin tone because this is
a little spooky mokuba all right so
while we're baking in the oven we're
gonna move on to the next step which of
course is going to be my eyebrows and
you guys know I usually live for a good
eyebrow pencil but what I don't like
using is brow powder so I'm gonna take a
break from the acrylics for a short
circuit and today I think I'm gonna use
these watercolors just gonna grab the
little paintbrush that came in the set
and dip into my little cup of water dip
into the brown shade which is very very
warm
oh god this could be bad I'm also gonna
grab some block two because that sounds
scary okay here we go
this could be good then I'm just gonna
apply it using an angled brush that I
found once again at the earth store oh
oh oh my god I love that I am literally
sliding this challenge what is going on
yo why is that brow Loki fire oh ho I
love this so much oh my god you're
literally kidding me Wow I am looking to
makeup invented glam the other gurus
could never the other guy Wow
once again Anasazi Beverly Hills whoo
this challenge surprisingly is going
very very well so far
all right so now that the brows are all
done it's time to move on to the
eyeshadow and I'm really really excited
for this obviously this is the part that
I can shine in you guys know I love a
colorful eyeshadow looks and I feel like
I literally have the morphe a35 be here
or sitting in front of me actually you
know what more p35 be sweetie I am so
sorry
use ko James her tempers up but you know
what this could be a really really great
second alternative so I'm just gonna go
in and so I was like am and see what we
can come up with I guess I'm gonna go
ahead and scrape all my colors in the
beginning to get the pigments all ready
for you so I'm first gonna show off with
this yellow shade that I'm gonna use
I think decrease I'm gonna grab this
hole and shade then this red shade then
this cranberry shade that is purple
shade and then finally just a little bit
of the black all right this is what we
got going on let's see what we can come
up with oh there it is despite the fact
that these are literally raw segments
going onto my eyeball I'm actually
surprised at how not pigmented they are
and how much I actually have to layer
them up but I feel like we can
definitely make a some form of really
cute I look work with this I'm just
gonna layer in some red into the crease
oh that's penguin Ted okay we're getting
somewhere we're getting somewhere
I really want to do a sunset halo eye
with these colors it's literally one of
the hardest color combinations to do and
it also uses a lot of different colors
so it's a challenge next I'm gonna grab
this number six round blender watercolor
brush literally pencil brush use Coe
James 10% off morphe something you want
to tell us here I've definitely noticed
that the best way to get color payoff is
to definitely pack the color in first
and then kind of blend it out later if
you go in and try to like layer up like
I would normally do eyeshadow it doesn't
really show up that much and obviously
when it comes to a sunset halo eye we
kind of need that pigmentation there so
definitely pack and then blend if you'd
ever be doing this I don't know why
you'd ever need this technique ever in
your entire life unless you're gonna get
ready using our supplies but I'm just
being the gurus that I am I want to go
ahead and cut out the center of this
crease and plop summit glitter and more
shadows on there so I'm just gonna grab
that rounded concealer brush once again
oh my god I literally love this brush
this is a hundred percent getting added
to my regular collection
you
okay the one major downside to using
chalk pastels for your eyeshadow the
fall out who for the lid I picked up
these ultrafine glitters from the cross
short now of course you guys know
glitter unless it is cosmetic grade it
should not be used on the eyes but you
know what most of these products
probably should not be use of on the eye
so don't call this advice but I'm gonna
pop this gold one right on there I'm
literally in love with how this is
looking so far like hello this is
definitely a good sister i luck so I
think I want to add a winged liner I'm
getting a real confident clearly but you
know what this looks good so I'm gonna
grab this ace paint that I got and this
is body safe
thank God so I'm gonna grab the black
shade and do my best to put on a good
and fresh sister wing liner the sirens
my eyeball may or may not be burning a
little bit right now but you know what
that's a wing and it's ready to cut
somebody I am literally honestly
impressing myself right now I literally
feel like the Christian army I'm gonna
try to adjust away some of this fallout
oh thank god okay wig for the lower lash
line why not let's do a pop of color I'm
gonna describe this a blue talk right
here scrape a little bit of it all and
plop it on there
alright sisters that is one eye all
complete I do not plan on going this
intense but I'm literally loving this so
far I'm gonna go to do the other one
off-camera quickly and just really
really get in the zone just be a true
artiste and he'll be right back to
finish off the rest of the LOC all races
I am back those are both legs all
complete I just wanted to throw it I
really lost with Miami by Allison baver
and then also my Mac extended play on
mascara sorry
love you guys the most and love this
challenge knows that I was not taking a
chance getting a style by using some
wonky products on my eyelashes I digress
the next step they were set up all on
the routine is going to be the glow and
before we get into this I'm gonna give
these a quick spritz
I'm not fix plus I am NOT gonna chance
to kind
since we're feeling a little bit cakey
right now get it but um baking Joe's
crafts or anyway that was the worst now
if you're not familiar with baking this
is called las Arras and it is basically
a edible shimmery powder that goes on
top of cupcakes to give them a nice
shimmery Sparkle something God just
edible that's gonna be safe with the
skin and I'm going to use this for my
eyelid in our today it's literally the
only shimmery product I can find I hope
that color works for me and I'm just
going to put this on and live my fantasy
