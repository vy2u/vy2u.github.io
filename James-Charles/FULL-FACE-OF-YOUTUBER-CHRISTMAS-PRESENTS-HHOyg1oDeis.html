welcome back to my youtube channel
happy holidays sisters I hope everyone
is having an absolutely amazing week
this year
apparently Stanton has decided to bring
me a sty I have not been able to put on
makeup for six days now which has been
so incredibly inconvenient if you've
been following me on snapchat you know
that literally a few days ago it was so
swollen that I can barely even open it
so now we have definitely made
improvements please do not leave any
comments I am well aware of the fact
that I look like I am looking in two
different directions
we're just gonna roll with it I have to
get this video done for today's video
have something actually super super fun
plan that I'm very excited to do in
honor of the holiday season obviously to
the holiday times it's time to see your
family at time for friends love laughter
lots of good food and also the season of
giving I personally love giving gifts to
all my friends and family it is so much
fun for me to be able to think of really
really cute things just to give back to
the people that mean the most to me and
this is gonna be the first year that I'm
actually not setting up my family on
Christmas I'm gonna be here in LA all
alone so in order to compensate for that
I force all my close friends to give me
gifts no but in all seriousness today's
video is going to be doing a full face a
youtuber Christmas presence I hit up all
my favorite content creators that I
really really love and look up to and I
assigned each one of them 1 7 my recap
routine and they all picked out a
surprise product and hopefully we can
come up with a good luck by the end of
it without further ado I have my Santa
hat on or just get into the Christmas
spirit of opening all these cute gifts I
have a ton of pockets here in front of
me for all of my favorite youtubers and
some of your favorite youtubers so if
you see someone you love it don't forget
to give this video a big thumbs up
especially if you were enjoying it and
let's get started so let's get right
into this routine and you guys know our
first step was always going to be to
prime our face so our first Christmas
gift today it's from my favorite sister
Sofia 9-yard so along with every gift
each creator sent me a short cute little
video explaining why they picked what
they picked let's see what Sofia got
hello James Merry Christmas I sent you
this Urban Decay quick-fix
Hydra charge complexion prep priming
spray I also bought myself another
sample size I don't usually use like
primers that you put on with your hands
I like to spray stuff on my face so
that's why I send you this and I hope
you like it
I don't have as much experience with
primers as you probably do but I do like
this one and it smells nice when it goes
on your face anyway I hope you like it
Merry Christmas again and a Happy New
Year
thank you sister Sofia so now that our
place is all primed ready to go our next
up is going to be a foundation and for
this I assigned it the queen of skin
taught to us Brock hey sister James so
by now I'm sure you have looked in the
bag this is the Allah mer soft fluid
liquid foundation that is expensive but
it is a miracle product and I'm curious
what your thoughts are on it you already
have pretty awesome skin but I think
that it is time for you to branch out
and try new things that are not your
makeup forever stick foundation oh all
right I hope you love it
I'm curious to see how your luck turns
out and I love you lots
Oh so mama Westbrook wanted to come for
me today I see how it's gonna be spicy
let's go out a planners talk to you got
me shade number ivory Oh - hopefully it
is a good for my skin it's a good match
you guys know I'm definitely a very very
a full-coverage type of queen even when
I'm doing a more natural look I'll still
use a light foundation and just sheer
out I would normally never reach for a
foundation
dish share but I actually feel like it
layered beautifully on the skin so I
embrace needed to keep using this and
trying it out thanks sister talk to you
so our next step is gonna be to hide our
under-eye bags and make our face nice
and bright like the startup of the
Christmas tree and for this we're gonna
be using concealer which is sent to me
by it Nicole Concilio hey James its
sister Nicole so my gift to you is
heart-shaped tape because I really feel
like that was such a staple product of
2017 it was everybody's favorite and I
know that you really like it too so I
wanted to give you a nice gift for the
holidays Merry Christmas
thank you sister Nicole sent me the
shade light which is actually the strain
that I use all the time so shades down
like a true sister let's go ton apply
this on all the right places Sun sister
talked to send us a very very light
coverage foundation today obviously you
guys know shade Cape is very very full
coverage so I feel like these two will
balance each other out really nicely to
create a beautiful base okay so now that
the foundation the concealer all in
plates obviously we have to
- Arkansas it lasts all day long and for
this I signed no other than sister
Patrick stir we all know he's the
full-coverage queen he always wears tons
and tons and tons of powder but he still
looks flawless somehow so if ever did be
the perfect person to give me the best
powder ever hey sister when you're with
us co-star happy holidays and is want to
say grab have to start powder and
Patrick Fulop lost the best gift ever
who doesn't love a juicy lip glass shiny
look on the lips with a classic red it's
definitely so so beautiful and I'm the
powders that you make it flawlessly it's
so so gorgeous then I hope you guys love
it for this holiday season
I'm Pascal and Merry Christmas Oh
Patrick's new lip gloss is also in here
- I've actually been rocking this a lot
lately so this'll be the perfect lip
later on thanks Patrick
for contour today I have a pocket from
one my all-time favorite youtubers Rob
Beauty by Christie she sent me this
pocket open here see what she got us hey
sisters today James asked me to pick a
contour product and I was like what
contour product should I pick and I
thought initially I'm Kat Von D shade +
light I know I love that one and I know
James does too but then I thought what
would James do and I think he would use
code games for 10% off so today I
decided to go with the morphe 9 C
palette so have fun contouring and don't
forget to use code James like you ever
could oh she is the cutest ever and also
this pocketing is the cute as ever she
even added a little bow thank you sister
Christine I reckon a face is all
snatched and set and please thanks to
sister Christie I literally love her in
her videos so much and don't forget to
use code change to 10% off this holiday
season even though our faces all
chiseled out we are missing one thing
and that is blush when I think a
beautiful skin and just happiness and
beautiful rosy cheeks
I think of Alyssa Ashley
oh this is a beautiful color thank you
sister ELISA happy holidays from me to
you now I'm going to dip into a little
bit more of Patrick's powder and I'm
going to bake my face so while our base
is baking in place at 350 degrees and we
are making some beautiful Christmas
cookies we're gonna move on to the
eyebrows normally I would say eyebrows
are supposed to be sisters and not twins
but obviously you want them to be as
close as we possibly can get so to start
my brows in place today I asked my
favorite set of twins to send me brow
products what's up sister I am stuck in
bed right now unfortunately but for the
holidays I was able to send you an expo
marker for your eyebrows because I feel
like this is a very underrated product
in the makeup world and it's gonna get
your eyebrows looking nice and thick
because we love a thick sister happy
holidays oh my god
what's up sis I sent you uh what I send
you I don't really know what it is I
asked my mom and she said it was good so
I sent it well it's free I wrote wait
these are actually so good okay Grayson
sent me the Kelly Baker a brow pencil
and brow definer Kelly Baker is a
legendary a brow person hopefully I can
make some combination of this work
I hate you Oh
joke's on you sister because this
doesn't even look that bad huh all right
now that the bras are all snatched in
place it is a Christmas miracle if I do
say so myself thanks Ethan we're gonna
move on to the eye shadow you guys
thought when I started off doing makeup
I was in it for the really really
colorful beautiful creative looks and
when I think of eyeshadow and really
really beautiful vibrant colors I first
think of a sister Jackie ina hi James
it's a girl jacket Oh what it's so do I
really have to explain why I chose a Pat
McGrath eyeshadow palette come on come
on it's fab grad like come on seriously
you're you Billy you Billy Pat McGrath
is not only one of my favorite makeup
artists but I really kind of feel like
you know how to push the envelope and
the boundaries when it comes to color
and playing with the eyes and shadows so
I chose one of my favorite palettes from
her collection I know that you can put
whatever your heart desires to using
that palette so good luck and have fun
sister jockeys that we the Pat McGrath
mothership palette I've actually never
I've actually never tried it Pat McGrath
shadow before but I've heard they're
absolutely legendary Pat McGrath is an
iconic makeup artist I'm very very
excited to play with this today I'm
first gonna grab the shade dark which is
this one right here on Miami for for one
and put this on my crease I'm gonna go
in pretty lightly with this because this
power actually does not have a lot of
matte shades so I really want to make
sure that this is blended out really
nicely and doesn't look too crazy next
add some holiday cheer I'm gonna grab
the shade right here called a blitz I
wrote this is beautiful
bright green shade I don't want you to
Sprint's it with a little bit of
settings bright and talk this on the lid
to create a halo eye effect
well that's pigmented that's beautiful
oh my god
and then for a bright holiday pop of
color I'm gonna grab this bronze shade
right up in here and once a little bit
more settings by it and pop this right
in the center of the lid all right guys
that is the shadow I'll complete thank
you sister Jackie for such an amazing
and beautiful palette I had so much fun
I got the Pat McGrath shades they're
absolutely beautiful and clearly the
pigment is literally unreal I'm
definitely looking forward to playing
this in the future and thank you for a
challenge as well it has been a while is
that I've been able to play with color
but obviously the eyes are not done yet
we need to apply the lashes so we all
know that a good pair of flirty
beautiful lashes complete any good eye
shadow look and when I think of a flirty
beautiful sister I think of our country
gal Laura Lee let's go ahead and see
what she picked out for us today
hey James E Wayne Z so the last I picked
for you are their Little Ashes Miami or
Little Ashes Mykonos and I picked them
for you to be a good friend because I
know you love a big Vivah boom
lash I was thinking about giving you a
little art out wispy wispy lash which I
know with sabotager look but I didn't I
just had to be a good friend and give
you a good old thick lash from Lily
lashes I hope you enjoyed them I love
you so much and I hope you the best
holidays oh thank you sister Laura Lee
oh my god a good Lily laughing style you
know I just went ahead and I popped on
the lashes from sister Laura Lee and I
also applied some mascara to fun
together that the real ones and the fake
ones once again it please bear with me
here on the eyes I didn't really want to
apply too much mascara or any eyeliner
so if they look a little bit wonky your
just got to bear with me I'm trying not
to go blind to you so now that the eyes
are both complete we are gonna move on
to the rest of the face and of course
our next step is going to be the glow
when I think of a beautiful dewy skin
and a highlight are ready to blind
everybody walking by I think of sister
Jacqueline Hill hello sister James and
Happy Holidays
for this Christmas I wanted to give you
the gift of glow and because I am extra
just as we all are
I could not narrow it down to just one
highlight so I sent you three three of
like my top dog I love these three so
much so guys how you get them all to you
I love you glow get them
so q are you kidding okay so of course
Auckland sent us her collaboration with
Becca champagne pop we all know this
beautiful and iconic hai later she also
sent me the Stila
heavens q hi leader I've actually never
tried this one before as well as the
makeup forever pigment in number I
guarantee it number 13 I love this one
as well this is definitely a recipe for
a blinding glow okay literally I'm just
gonna apply all three highlighters say
because we got to be extra for the
Christmas season and of course gotta be
actually like sister Jacqueline so I'm
first finger way I'm five on one brush
and dip into this to this palette is
really really sunny it's like a
beautiful pinky shade but it's
definitely like a glow from with an type
of highlighter not like a blinding glow
so I'm gonna go over top of it with a
champagne pop and last but finally not
least just for an extra pop of this
holiday season I'm gonna layer over top
with the littlest bet because let's be
real this is intense I'll to make up
forever pigment number 13 oh my god
Santa and the reindeer literally just
right into the chimney that's how bright
this how it is are you kidding Oh sister
Jacqueline snapped I'm gonna go ahead
and line my lips using the mock Patrick
Starr lip liner in the shade brick and
then fill it in with the Patrick gloss
in the shade Patrick coming on this red
is literally so stunning if you guys are
gonna buy anything for the Matt projects
art collection you need this frickin lip
gloss it is so sunny I've never really
been a red lip type of person until the
last few weeks for some reason I've just
been putting it on and oh my god like
I'm obsessed you need this
thank you sister project for the amazing
collection and for the amazing gifts so
last but certainly not least our faces
obviously all complete but we have one
last step and that is to set our face in
place so it lasts all day long to all
the Christmas festivities and all the
holiday cheer and for this product I
signed it to a youtuber that I have
loved forever have looked up to for so
long but knows absolutely nothing about
beauty and that is this sir Shane Dawson
wow I love Christmas promo code Christ
hi James so you wanted me to send you a
setting spray and I don't know what that
means now it's not technically a setting
spray but
is a catnip freight called yahwah
Juwanna and you're not supposed to
ingest it or have it anywhere near your
face so good luck sister oh my god
well I may not be able to attract any
boys under the mistletoe this holiday
season but at least I know I'll be able
to attract some Merry Christmas sister
