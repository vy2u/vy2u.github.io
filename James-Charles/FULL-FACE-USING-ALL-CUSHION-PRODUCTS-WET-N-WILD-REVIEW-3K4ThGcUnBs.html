bath time YouTube channel so for today's
video if you read the title it is going
to be a review and this is the number
two of you on my channel I am very very
excited I had a lot of fun doing it the
first one I definitely want to do more
reviews in the future your new product
comes out or you see saying that you
want me to talk lot and see what my
opinion is please make sure to tweet me
or stat least I can definitely make a
video on it the new hottest things for
you guys that being said I just got a
package from wet-and-wild in the mail a
few days ago and it is the brand-new
mega cushion collection it came in this
cute little cushion looking a box right
up in here and if you open it up the
collection comes with six cushions the
collection comes with six cushion
contacts and three cushion lip cream I
have no idea how a cushion lift cream is
going to work but I guess we are going
to find out there's a highlight a
contour as well as four color correctors
which I'm a super standard to trial I
have never actually used a cushion
product on my face before I know cushion
foundations were wildly wildly popular
for a very very long time a few like
month so in the beauty scene but I never
actually put one on my face so I'm super
duper excited to try them out today
looking at this collection right now it
says they are fragrance free gluten free
cruelty free and vegan as well
that means no animals were harmed in the
making of this product which is so
amazing so they know a lot of you guys
care a lot about that yeah so the
Christian compacts retail for $5.99 each
and the lip cushions retail for $4.99
each so definitely super cheap and
affordable but let's go ahead and put
these products as the real test to see
how they actually apply on a face before
we go with any actual base product I
want to call it product my faces that
it's what majority of the Sexson sista
so first integral to the shade peach
which is the orange color corrector and
that is for dark circles so this thing
comes with this little cushion on the
inside says wet and wild on it
definitely SuperDuper cute and then it
is protected as well so it can't get
dirty thank God
and then when you open it up this is
what it looks like oh god okay look neat
is on my head is super super light which
is definitely very very worrying to me I
did just get a spray tan so I am drawer
frozen normal and this is going to be
like
looking color and as well when you do
want to correct dark circles you
definitely want a pretty like deep
orange even red shade depending on how
dark your skin tone is to really combat
the blues and the purple tones of the
dark circles so I'm not really sure how
this is going to work but I guess let's
just go ahead and get on the cushion and
apply it under the eyes and see how and
look I mean the formula field language
this is definitely not the right color
that an orange color corrector should be
but then again Who am I to say what a
color should be so I guess we're just
going to continue putting this on and
see what it looks like later on since
it's for darkness I'm also going to take
a little more of this and I'm going to
put this on my facial hair area just to
combat once again to see blues and
purple tones that hair gets all I
literally just shaved my entire face
like two hours ago and it's already
coming and back in never heard a five
o'clock shadow before apparently when
you're me you get 12 p.m. shadow the
next one I'm going to use is the shade
green which is for redness and once
again the green is super super like
literally looks white on camera
the green is launched next to the orange
on my hand literally you can barely even
tell that there's color there normal
color characters that I seen before are
usually a lot deeper but once again not
going to knock in so we play everything
else from our top and see how it really
looks like I said green color characters
are typically for fixing redness and
honestly I'm having a decent skin day
today so I'm just going to places over a
few little blemishes over here not one
over here
I guess I'm just going to top the a
croissant on to my nose because I know
it tends to get pretty Reb the other
shoe color factors in the collection are
yellow which brightens and then purple
which combats yellow and neither one of
those really problem that I have on my
face I guess I'm just going to skip out
on those today and move right into
foundation now when I find it pretty
great about this entire collection is
that it is the Magnus cushion collection
but the one product that isn't in this
function is a cushion foundation I kind
of thing before cushion foundations were
hugely popular at one point and even
still are today I see a ton of people
using cushion foundations and rocking
them so so well so I was pretty
surprised that they're one the cushion
foundation in this actual collection but
I went in and I picked up the photo
focus foundation to go with this love I
was debating whether or not to use the
L'Oreal person foundation or the
Maybelline one because I heard those are
superb um and I did find them at the
drugstore but I figured easily wet and
wild one or probably a lot better just
because these are wet and wild products
so I'm sure the formulas will kind of
like work a little bit better together
than the Babli informit or the L'Oreal
formula mix together might make things a
little bit wonky I just want to get
these products a very very fair chance
because a cushion product definitely
it's like a weird cause it to a lot of
people so gotta be fair you feel for my
foundation today I picked up the shade a
cream beige which is actually the only
color they had left at my C's yes I'm
pregnant for shade not just me we're
going to go right handle in Chinatown
okay this is not the applicator I'll
just resting to layer this right over
top of all the colors factors okay and
it's different a little bit dark too
we could definitely lighten this up open
a computer on it do not worry the
information is also only $5.99 wet and
well is definitely a not playing around
when it comes to these amazing prices
they say girl these on a budget we got
you and major respect for that makeup
can be so crazy expensive sometimes so
it's so relieving when we see amazing
and cheap products but I don't want to
call it amazing yet I will let you guys
know in a few quick seconds alright so
that is the foundation all applied over
top of the color corrector honestly
looking at this in the mirror my face
looks so good right now and I know this
foundation is not the plate of the video
but for $5.99 I'm a little bit shook to
be honest and I definitely will be try
this again for sure and a normal
everyday makeup routine because I really
like the base a lot moving on to the
color corrector
a lot lighter than normal color
correctors but my darkness my redness is
pretty even out for the most part you
can't really see anything especially
under the eyes ISA guys look really
really bright and nice which definitely
does not work with a lot of foundations
sometimes I'm not sure how like full
coverage this actual foundation is oh my
god the thing on the back first says
goodbye photo flash back maybe that's
why I love this foundation so much it
doesn't say the level of coverage on the
actual foundation bottle but I was doing
this it's pretty pretty full coverage my
skin looks very very even if I
definitely like the way the color
corrector applied so once again only
five dollars definitely it not bad I'm
liking this a lot so far will be
launched a concealer once again similar
to the foundation there was no pressed
cushion concealer so I went on right
picked up the auto focus concealer I
picked up the shade of light ivory
because once again this is the only
shades they had and stock at my CP yeah
see ya you need to step your out
I'm just going to apply this like a
normal concealer in the high points of
my face and blend it out but one thing I
notice about these products is that they
all dried out SuperDuper fast including
the color corrector I know the
foundation and concealer are not like
the point of this video but like I said
I wanted to use them just kind of
formula match they're definitely super
super drying a but that means I might
not have to tip my face today so I'm
honestly excited to see how this turns
out now that the base somehow they are
all we're going to do some cream
contouring intercessory burning is the
cushion contour in the shade cafe au
lait that they was literally so cute I
cannot get over it but similar to the
color factors we're going to open up
we're going to have a little bit of a
cushion a cover and then the contour
shade and this one actually looks like
it's a dark color and thank God here's a
little thing on the back of my hand
definitely a pretty it warm tone so this
contour is can be very very strong Z who
probably will not be using any browser
today but let's go ahead and put out the
actual face and see how it applied
alright so the shade is definitely very
very very light and like I think before
I do have a spray tan right now so it is
barely even showing up my face which is
a little bit disappointing to me just
because the other two shades are
definitely very very light as well so it
seems like anybody that's like darker
than the shades mayonnaise will probably
not really be able to
you set come on beauty brands we really
need to stop playing fifty shades of
white here there are darker people in
the world that want to wear your makeup
I'm just going to dip right into my
Beauty Blender with this because of
blending this out with my little sponge
is definitely taking a too long I do not
have a lot of time today so I'm just
going to let this ring and using my
Beauty Blender I'm going to try to cream
frontally know a little bit - alright
and that is the contouring and chiseling
all complete I don't hate it it
definitely looks pretty good but it's
definitely just very very very subtle
barely there type of situation this is
definitely a shade that it's going to
work for very very few people because it
is so light and not very pigmented we're
just pretty disappointing like I said
before there are so many other shades of
color other than the 50 shades of white
a particular one is one of the past me
but I like the color corrector so far
and let's go ahead and move on with the
highlighter the last question that I'm
gonna be using is the highlighter and
this is in the shade who's that
pearl you guys know that normally I
would do our highlighter way later on in
my makeup routine a but understand it as
a base for today and do my eyes and like
eyebrows and stuff
off camera because this is a review not
a makeup tutorial I'm trying to get
better at like separating everything and
really learn how this type of content
looks please bear with me but since this
is all a cream and liquid base I want to
make sure that everything is like in the
right order and if I do decide use any
powders I don't wanna like disrupt the
product so this is what to be a
highlighter it looks like in the pan it
is a very very pinky tone time later for
sure let's go ahead and grab our little
clean cushion and put it into the pan
and do a little swatch the feather is
definitely pretty pretty on the camera
you can see it next to the color
correctors it is very very light it's
almost like white with just a tiny
little bit of pink reflects in it so I'm
very very worried to see how this is
going to look on the face hopefully
doesn't give like that great cast but a
lot of highlighters give but let's go
ahead and put it on and see okay so I
don't know who thought of applying
eyeliner with a cushion but this is
definitely not the shape of thing that
you'd want to be applying blow it I'm
going to go in by a Beauty Blender and
tighter buns
little bit honestly that's not pretty
chalky and blending in a Highlander with
a cushion definitely well I'll do that
again okay let me stop while I'm ahead
before I get too crazy and then end up
taking my time ago while competing it so
much this does not look awful I really
really like the color how to trick it
worked it very very well for me even
though it was SuperDuper light I really
like the foundation and I like the
concealer as well I guess it doesn't
really matter because the foundation and
concealer we're not really part of this
review but that's what it's come to
now that the base is all complete I'm
going to go into the other self off
camera so I'm going to do my brows in my
eyes and then I'll come back for the
lips and we're going to tense up the lip
cushions that are in this collection so
I will be right back alright so just
there together this pink glowy leather
absolutely love this turns out this
looks really pretty on camera as well
for everything I use the I love that ie
X color pop collection it's brand new
and I use this shade over here which is
called heavy glandt
it is so beautiful and very very
primitive as you can see I use it for
the inner corners and my globe as well
because lord knows that cushion
highlighter was definitely lacking but
the last thing we have on our list today
is the lips so we have these three lips
cushion shades right up in here you have
this purpley shape which is called a
bubble gum and paradise this bright pink
which is called a doll so hard and then
this ready orange which is called melon
like it is I'm definitely not doing the
bright pink or the bright purple so
today I'm going to go with this ready
orange type shade to hopefully match
between my study and the pink and inner
corners I also have no idea to be
completely honest as soon as it's videos
over I'm going to replace it with a
glossy lip for the Instagram photo
anyway but obviously I want to finish
the review for you guys let's go ahead
and apply this one we have melon like it
is always I guess this is what it means
land of cush and lip okay interesting
this is strange these are supposed to
dry down map which is definitely doing
the thermo honest thing is not awful if
I'm looking in the mirror it definitely
has a little bit patchy and cracki
I think that's just because the
applicator is absolutely awful it's
really hard to get it like a precise
line as you can see like over here I'm
Way outside of the lip line I find up
over a lion as well and it is definitely
not looking even I don't know why a ball
applicator would ever be useful to
anybody trying to get a precise lip line
maybe it was just like for really really
quick like so with padding type action
but definitely not for like the serious
makeup liquid lipstick wearer all right
guys - does it look all complete let's
go back and recap everything that we've
tried out so far so as a reminder we
were viewing the white and Wild mega
cushion collection today we had four
four color correctors a highlight
cushion and a contour cushion and then
three lip cushions in this full set
helicopters they were definitely pretty
good they retail for $5.99 each I really
like the green one and the orange ones
they did a very good job of covering on
my acne and my dark circles my skin to
look super even right now and I'm
absolutely loving it especially with the
foundation as well which was not
cushioned but definitely will be used by
me again that's aside from the point
though is the purple and yellow color
correctors I definitely would skip how
odd I'm not saying they're bad by any
means I honestly do not even try them
but I am someone who has never ever used
a purple or yellow color corrector I
personally don't really see much of a
place for them as for the highlighting
contour shades these are just a little
bit more of a mystery the cause will
honestly looked really really pretty on
my skin tone it blends out pretty well
once I use my Beauty Blender but it was
not that and ten the worst parts about
it is it was very very light
I am expression right now and it barely
shows up on me meaning for anybody
that's darker than me which is like
majority of the entire world population
it would not look very good and probably
would also highly nursing and that was
obviously not the goal of a contour
cushion but that being said it worked
for me if what I recommend it may be it
definitely depends on your skin tone as
for the highlighter this almost
definitely the worst fail of the
collection it just like a lighter
pigment in general I really didn't have
much of like a high lady glow once I
finished off the look I obviously pack
a ton of that pink single shadow that
even the intercourse as well for the
Highlander because how that it was
looking very very talking and definitely
not doing it for me as with the three
lip cousins I honestly really really
like the formula they went on very very
nicely they applied nicely and they look
nice they feel nice the only part I
would recommend is the actual applicator
of the lip cushions themself the ball
applicator just really doesn't make a
whole lot of says it's messy it's hard
to get a good lip slide I definitely
would not recommend but for $4.99
honestly just get it squeeze it on your
hand and then use a lip brush because I
really like these lip products after
looking at everything I honestly cannot
decide if this collection is a hit or
miss it's not very often that a group of
product is so evenly split like I feel
like there are a lot of really really
good products and they're also a lot of
things that I would literally never use
again so I'm like hardcore on the fence
right now definitely leave me a comment
down below and tell me what you thought
of each product
have you used cushion problems before
let me know what's your favorite type of
stuff let's have a nice little sister's
discussion in the comments down below

concepts of cushion foundation I would
love to try and more in the future and
definitely I will keep you guys posted
on what I think but for the most part

things I definitely wanna hear what you
guys have to say that being said if you
