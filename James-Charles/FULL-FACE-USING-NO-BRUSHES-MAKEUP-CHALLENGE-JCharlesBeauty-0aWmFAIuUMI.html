to my youtube channel I really want to
film a really fun book this week so I
asked you guys on Twitter what you
wanted to see and almost all of you guys
said do a challenge I do and I was so
down I've been doing a lot of tutorials
so I thought it was finally time for me
to challenge myself and do a challenge
video a lot of challenges in one
sentence since I just got myself a new
pair of very very very pointy stilettos
I thought it'd be a perfect day to put
my morphe brushes into retirement for a
little while and do the no brushes
makeup challenge I decided to do this
pinky Rose cut crease with the glitter
liner and obviously I'm very very proud
of how it turned out it was not easy but
I love the finished look so if you want
to see hard created this using a single
mega brush make sure to keep on watching
I'm going to start out as always priming
my face using my benefit Porefessional
primer this is definitely the easiest
step of this tutorial considering I
always prime it using my units anyway
which is just what I like to do it this
is about to go downhill real fast so
brace yourselves for punishing today
meetings my makeup forever
Ultra HD foundation stick but I guess
that's putting it on this way we kind of
be like cheating I'm going to rub it
into my fingers and then put it on that
way oh wow and now I guess we're going
to start to by the side of my fingers
okay okay this could be a lot worse this
is not as bad as I was thinking yet
knock on wood because we all know it's
going to change in about 15 seconds for
concealer today I'm going to use my Too
Faced Born This Way concealer in the
shade very fair and I'm just going to
tap this in under my eyes and all around
the face using my own finger once again
well is this a personal trip to go my
channel this is not the first challenge
I've actually done I haven't tried a lot
of the other challenge that I've been
floating around YouTube but just in my
own time they have been very very fun
but this one is alarmingly
dangerous with the set of nails that I
just acquired today I'm going to quickly
say under my eyes using my code here is
on powder a matte the shade of
translucent and once that's packed under
the eyes just preventing I'm going to
take more about my entire
and literally beat my face to come to my
face today I'm going to be using my Too
Faced milk chocolate Soleil bronzer oh
holy crap I'm feeling extremely patchy
right now and it's getting on my last
nerves but there's something I could
really do to fix that I guess so I'm
going to go ahead and bake my face using
my fingers once again in my Cody or some
powder I'm going to go ahead and let
this bake for a few minutes
fingers crossed this contour gets a
little bit cleaner because if right now
this looks awful so I will be your right
back in a second and we can go on the
rest of the face alright I'm going to go
ahead and do you guys in so we get
started on the eyes to do this problem
going to start off by dipping my nail
into a dissociative row in the shade
evany this is where having long nails
really is coming in handy
and then to tidy up the bar a little bit
I'm going to take some room this way
once again on the tip of my finger nail
and just go under the brow oh no no no
no I need you to stay right there don't
move
once I under militant Philippe and I'm
just going to take the remainder of the
concealer on my finger and blend that in
as well as cover my eyelid for my outlet
today I decided to do a cut crease I
know I just did one recently on my
channel but I was do a little bit of a
simpler one for you guys at home and I
know how bees will be super super hard
to do with just my fingers so I wanted
to challenge myself I'm going to start
off by drawing the bottom line of the
crease using my fingernail and a cherry
cola from makeup geek and then I'm
taking a tiny bit of morphe brick shadow
and on my pinky I'm going to start to
blend in that line okay I guess that's
as good as we're going to get so I'm
going to go back in now with cherry cola
once again on the tip of my fingernail
and to find that crease line a little
bit more this is definitely a challenge
to say the least and not as easy as I
was expecting
getting the like product in the place
that I wanted to is extremely easy
having nails this pointy but actually
blending out the product is extremely
hard because I really have access to my
fingertips because um the nails in the
way and then to finish off the cut
crease I'm just going to define it a
little bit more using Anasazi beauty
mark
I highlight my brow bone I'm going to
mix together the pink and the white
shade from the old from Beverly Hills
highlighter now normally I'll go in with
some concealer underneath the spacious
to really really cut it and make it
super sharp but today I'm going to be
doing some glitter liner underneath the
crease not is going to be kind of my cut
so I don't even need to worry about it
for the glitter liner I'm going to dip
my nail into my mehron mixing medium and
just draw a thin line right under the
 Reese and I'm dipping right into
eye candy glitter in a double bubble I'm
going to press that glitter right into
the adhesive
well I guess now we're going to try to
do a wing I am immediately regretting
this and I haven't even started yet but
I'm going to dip my fingertip into more
via gel liner and
it's late and pray holy crap I can't
believe I actually just said that okay
not the best wing liner but definitely
not the worst for my lower lashline I'm
going to use makeup geek bitten and just
wounded by pinky and slides out into
life oh okay so apparently that didn't
work too well so instead I'm going to go
to bitten on at the tip of my nail and
about that in half lashline I feel like
the lower lash line was missing
something so I just did my finger back
into the mayor on mixing game and into
double bubble and just pop it a little
bit on the inner corner for mascara
today I'm gonna be using my usual
benefit roller lash but since I can't
really use the spoolie tie brush I'm
going to put some on my finger and then
try to apply it that way and pray that I
don't get it all over my eye hi this is
actually kind of working yes to finish
off the eye look I'm going to pop on the
divan upon slashes in the south I know
ho I'm going to go ahead and do the
other eye off-camera now I promise I'm
so defeating the challenge oh this is
much more fun than I anticipated
it's currently 2 a.m. but I have to wake
up for school in like four hours
lovelies I really need to focus and get
this done I'll be right back and we can
go ahead and finish the face and the
rest of the look ok there we go I
finished the second I literally 45
minutes later but you know what they
look good I'm happy with it let's move
on the Holly my face today I'm going to
mix in together the pink and white
shades again from The Oprah Beverly
Hills highlighter it's one of my face
and you can use code Jay Charles for 30%
off okay that actually looks not bad at
all and lastly to finish off this look
I'm going to very very very carefully
apply anasazi liquid lipstick in the
shade it's a girl and there we go guys
that completes this no roaches makeup
challenge thank you
all in all I'm really not too happy with
my skin I don't think I'll be putting on
my foundation with my fingers anytime
again soon but honestly the eyebrows
eyes lips and how they are all really do
not look tough
I'm pretty proud of myself for what I
was able to achieve there were
definitely some experts out there who
did much better than me
nikkietutorials but I've ever mad at
myself for succeeding and definitely
trying to challenge myself if you guys
