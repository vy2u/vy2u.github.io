welcome back to my youtube channel so if
you saw in last week's video which if
you have not you should definitely click
somewhere up here and check it out I did
an unboxing a free makeup at beauty
gurus game video and I opened all sorts
of wonky products all the new releases
seemed so good and I was absolutely
dying to try them out and of course
today just two days after throwing that
last video I opened my door this morning
and there are about 50 new PR packages
waiting for me they couldn't came two
days earlier to be in the free PR video
but you know I'm referring to what we
got for today today I wanted to sit down
I've got to put a new makeup that is all
fresh off the shelf we have a new primer
a new foundation a new highlighter and
new eyeshadow palette so a ton of great
new products that I am so excited to try
and honestly all turned out really
really good
spoiler alert so I did this one tone a
pop of color crease that you guys have
all been asking me to film a tutorial on
I post had to pick up my answer a few
days ago and yell went crazy and I did
do this look you can do new anasazi a
subculture eye palette and it turned out
so frickin good so if you want to see
how I created this makeup look right
here using all new products and first
impressions make sure you keep on
watching alright so before I go into the
actual foundation I'm going to first go
into might benefit Porefessional new
pore minimizing makeup now in the last
video if you guys have not checked it
out yet definitely go launch it it is a
PR unboxing video but I got three of
these and I thought that this was like a
three-step process but my dumb ass
failed to realize that there's actually
three different shades not three
different steps so I grabbed shade
number two I'm going to put this on and
see how it works hopefully we'll be
minimizing my pores because I could use
it alright so I guess this product is
not technically a foundation it just is
its pore minimizing makeup I'm not
really sure what that technically makes
I'd add but if I look close up in the
mirror my pores honestly do look really
really good they don't look like
completely cover obviously there's going
to be nothing that I can put on my face
it's kind of completely care into my
pores unfortunately for me and for
everybody else out there but definitely
they do look pretty pretty balm and
looking at the monitor as well my skin
definitely has like a blurred effect so
I think I actually really really like
this product but let's see how actually
layers underneath foundation okay so far
foundations they were actually using a
brand new at first impressions product
and that is the Smashbox Studios skin is
shaping foundation it is a dual ended
foundation stick with one end being
foundations and wanted being a contour
stick so
I'm super super excited to try these
I've heard really really good things
with them and I did actually get to test
you that's a very very very long time
ago
we have Smashbox and I was in love with
it then so this is not really a first
impressions for like a second
impressions but I think it'll be good
hopefully I could have to shade at one
point to which looking at it on my face
is definitely a little bit too yellow
and I know people love to comments like
my foundation it doesn't match my neck
thank you I am well aware of the fact
that I like to use a more tan foundation
than my skintone I think I get so many
comforts on it and it is definitely
saying that I am aware of and do on
purpose so thank you so much for your
concern but I'm going to using this
shade today and it is definitely yellow
and I'm recognizing that right now so
please don't comment about it aside for
the fact that this foundation stick is
nowhere near the right color for me I
actually really really like how it looks
on my face it is definitely way too
yella but I'm going to even it out with
some concealer so far so good before I
going to that a concealer i'm going to
quickly cream contour my face using the
other end of the foundation stick
there's the thing that i definitely
don't like doing very often i definitely
before contouring with powders however
for the sake of this video obviously i
want to give the product a stayer shot
and a full on review so i'm going to
cream contour just the slightest bit
alright so this is definitely blending
out really really well as you can see i
did not take a lot of effort at all and
it funds really really nicely and again
obviously no one wants to sit there
pouncing a Beauty Blender into their
fork and cheek for 30 minutes try trying
to blend out of creating products will
look good and this is definitely going
out in a pretty little effort which is
awesome and I do like the color of this
as well it's definitely like contouring
and bronzing at the same time which is a
great and definitely a time-saver as
well that's kind of how I like to do my
contour smash bronzer in the first place
I really don't do them separately
they're kind of like one big process ray
and that's how I really do like it so I
definitely I'm liking this foundation
stick a lot I'm going to try to fix up
my skintone a little bit using the Tarte
shape tape and light I do not get any
new concealers in my PR packages
although color pop I noticed came out
with new considers and I'm dying to try
to so definitely let me know if you guys
nothing to do a video review on those
once I get them in the mail with my look
they'll probably come in like 20 minutes
as I'm selling this video after I
already have my shape tape on but
whatever we'll make it work another time
the actual clothes foundation definitely
looks a lot better not that I blend it
up my concealer and I'm course is going
to set it really lightly in place using
my Laura Mercier translucent setting
powder all right so it's called my face
today I'm using the brand new makeup
ever artist face color thing
little thing as a similar shade x11 -
and as I talked about in last week's
video that's has a very very special
place in my heart because sister Kathy
when I best friends in the entire world
did actually work with makeup ever on
creating these shadows and bringing them
all together to create a little bit of a
trio so I'm gonna be using her three
shades today to sculpt and it makes my
face look beautiful this contour sheet
is definitely very very cool tool
because sister Kathy is more on the pale
side and she has a more like pink
undertone but this honestly looks really
really good on my skin it doesn't look
gray or like Ashley in any way shape or
form it definitely like a very very good
like cheekbone or like bone shadow type
of color it looks like very very natural
and chiseled out I really like that for
blush that I'm going to grab the maker
forever artist face color blush and the
shade of B 402 now as you can see this
is bright orange so I'm only going to
use a very very little bit of this but
you guys do know that I love orange
blush a lot and oh my god this is very
very very pigmented which is a good
thing but also a scary thing oh my god
it's got a really really lightly
topically that's a lotta blush this is
not what I want this is not what I
planned and I just gotta say I do not
understand something is really something
is orange
something is really wrong someone is
literally playing music outside my
window so loud right now for no reason
at all I'm getting so annoyed another
siren of course what else could go wrong
I just did my brows off-camera you guys
to see me do it so many times now no
point in time the same exact process and
now for the eye shadow we have the star
of the show done student thought the
anasazi a subculture eyeshadow palette I
am so excited for this this is actually
not featured in my last video and I did
feature the anasazi liquid glow
highlighters we will be using in a
little while as well I just got this in
the mail a few minutes ago before I
started filming and I tweeted and so
many of you guys wanted to see this now
for the actual I look I was planning on
doing this cut crease the pop of color
luck dated a few days ago on my
Instagram everybody was freaking out
they loved it everybody asked for
tutorial so it's got a film not tonight
but this like I said just out here a few
minutes ago
oh my god you have to you subculture so
I am warning you now I am going to be
using the more classic colors from this
palette not the boring ones at all
because I feel like it's going to be so
beautiful but there's obviously like
this teal tone the green the bronzy
shade and the electric chartreuse as
well so I will not be using those shades
so please let me know if you want to
actually see a more in-depth advanced
tutorial using this palette but for
today's that I am going to use any more
classic warm tone shades I apologize for
that but you guys after this I'm first
gonna grab my Anasazi angled brush
number seven and dip into the shade of
fudge and start sketching out my crease
oh wow that is what we like to call
ladies and gentlemen pigmented so
concreted releasing that I've been a lot
on my channel and they are by far my
favorite makeup look to do I just love
the look of a good cut snatched crease
and this is it I think that I used to do
them I always take questions about it
because it is deadly a unique technique
but I always start off by drawing at the
bottom of the crease line with an angle
brush just to define it in and then
blend upwards afterwards I'm not going
to get my makeup Shakti 63 brush and dip
into a little bit more fudge and I'm
just going to buff out that line a
little bit now normally when it comes to
these I look beauty gurus never even
touch the brushes that actually come in
the palette but I am gonna grab this one
today on the flutter and and dip into
the shade new wave which is just like
very mac and cheese
orange a yellow shade it's so beautiful
and I'm just going to use this to a
blend that out oh my god these shadows
are so beyond pigmented
oh my god it is no secret to anybody the
Anasazi always killed it with the
pigmentation in their shadows but oh my
god these are real good mascara my
morphe r43 brush i'm going to dip into
the shade all-star and I would use that
to design out that crease again I'm
going to grab my makeup sack t6z brush
once again and dip into the shade of
Roxy and I'm going to use that to blend
together the fudge transition shade and
the all-star pinky shade if that makes
them
this is looking so messy for some reason
this is definitely looking a little bit
more wonky than my normal increase and I
really don't know why exactly but you
know we're just going to keep going and
hope that it looks good by the end of
this to finish off the shadow portion of
this crease I'm gonna grab my angle
brush once again and dip it to the
tiniest little bit of the shade Rowdy
and they're just going to carve it out
one last time
for some reason that was one of the
hardest hot creases I've ever had to do
I don't know why normally I can find
them so easily but today I'm having an
off day I guess whatever it looks pretty
decent now so I starting to go ahead and
move on and for the pop of color Landers
today I'm going to using the lime cry
liquid liner and the shade sit truth
you definitely ought to be super super
careful at this stuff as well because
especially when it comes to colored
liner they're usually very very drying
so if you do mess up it's going to be a
very very very hard to fix your mistakes
like I have made several times
throughout doing this type of look so
just be careful please so do my Wayne
Leonard today a godís my tried and true
and that is the Kat Von D tattoo liner
in the shade it trooper
this is definitely a much bigger
weighing that I wanted to go forward
today but I guess it's just one of those
days oh my god I forgot to find out the
cream contour underneath my lab for my
lower lash Jennifer's gonna turn up a
fudge on my morphe r43 brush and just
buff that into the lower lash line then
I'm going to grab the other end of the
Anasazi brush that comes in the palette
and I'm going to have to show you a new
wave and just buff out that color to
line my water then I'm going to use the
NYX wonder pencil in the shade light it
really helps to open your eyes up and
make your eyes look huge and docked
almost every single time I wear a cut
crease with a white liner in my
waterline I always get so many comments
feeling wide you basing your eyes to be
bigger and I'm like girl about
everything else on the entire face is
too soon except my eye shape why is that
even a concerned so wonky and for laughs
I'm going to pop on the house lash
iconic lashes I know that in my last
video I did get a package from Lily
lashes and I used the miami's but I feel
like iconic lashes like the absolutely
necessity last when it comes to a cut
crease they just look so beautiful in so
stunning and I did just get a new
package of these like 20 minutes ago
once again that's what I'm so annoyed
for some reason of course every single
PR package in the world decides to come
like three days after I saw an unboxing
free PR video oh that's just my luck
well I'm gluing this last I do want to
talk about something that I addressed in
the last video as well and that is the
illegal drugs that I received in my pure
package and I do want to give a major
major apology to a cloud9 syrup the
brand that did send me those products
they are not illegal and they are not
drugs either and I felt so bad because
like after reading your eyes come in
doing some more research I was like so
shocked and I felt so ignorant and dumb
so CBD hemp oil are not illegal contrary
to what I thought in the video and
they're also in marijuana like I did
think they're actually unlike the
medical side of marijuana the part of it
that like actually helps you and doesn't
get you high not going to lie as soon as
I recognize the word hemp which I knew
was in wheat I was so turned off because
you guys know that I'm very very anti
drug and I am very very ignorant as the
topic it's definitely nothing that I've
ever wanted to learn about or wanted to
educate myself about just because I do
know a lot of people in the social media
roles and in the entertainment industry
do go into very very bad passes
a lot of like drugs and addiction and
stuff so that's just saying that I've
tried it very very hard to stay away
from and I do pride myself in you can do
whatever you want but like I said I'm
very very ignorant to it so as soon as I
saw that I was like oh nope nope not
happening but after learning about it
more I did realize that I was part of
the medical side and I saw so many
comments from you guys being like oh my
god this is so disrespectful like I used
hemp oil and CBD every single night
because I have really bad anxiety and I
was like oh my god
obviously mental health is so important
that I would never want to purposely
degrade anxieties or mental health
issues at all and I really do sincerely
apologize if I comment in the last video
if I'm going to in any way shape or form
like I said I was ignorant to the topic
but now I've educated myself on it and
it's so amazing that products like this
do exist on the market to help people
out with those type of issues because I
know they are very very serious thing
like I said that is very very much not
my world and instead of educating myself
I just made a very very ignorant for a
clickbait title which was definitely
wrong so I do apologize and it is still
not for me but if you guys want to check
out their products please do check them
out they're an awesome brand and the
brand has reached out to me sent and
like gave me a ton of information so yes
sorry to combine syrup and if you guys
want to check it out I will link to self
down below alright and they're both
creases all cut and ready to go and now
it's time for what we've all been
waiting for
the glow for my holidays today I'm using
the brand new on a salvia
liquid glow and I'm going to be using
the shade Perla today so in the last
video I swatch for you guys to shade
peach phase which if you actually look
at the two labels on the boxes the
colors if they'll focus look pretty
relatively similar and I did use peach
phase but apparently that is actually a
darker shade than Perla which is why I
was giving that dark reflex which I was
worried about so for today we're going
to see pearl and hopefully that'll be
light enough for my skin tone oh my god
you're kidding this is going to be so
good I can already tell
so you can definitely apply a lot of in
one area if you want a super pigmented
highlight and you also see you can apply
a little bit of it and really blend it
out to get a more subtle glow and it's
definitely like looks beautiful either
way guys sister Trevor's here completely
sister sister ain't that mr. mister on
the radio the radio was high
wall you're gonna need it
let's get out oh good
alright I'm also gonna grab my Anasazi
at number eight fourteen brush and down
a little tiny bit of this to highlight
my nose oh my god literally satellites
from space are crashing as we speak this
note are you kidding me this is so
beautiful and I'm also gonna play a
little bit this on my brow bone as
always I've been loving highlighting up
here recently for that summer natural
dewy glow and oh my god this highlighter
is literally GG forged it is everything
so the anasazi liquid highlighters are
definitely a win for me as you can see
on my face right now they look so beyond
something I am so shocked and these are
definitely a new step to my regular
makeup routine so Hollywood can move
over I mean this sister would definitely
still be here but this is definitely a
new contender for short and I definitely
try these out in my everyday makeup
routine as well but when I do like a
more dewy no powder looks I would
definitely you guys know how it works
I'm there to Accession unlike the body
and the collarbones oh my god I'm just
picturing how frickin stunning that
would look alright so now that this look
is all complete the last step is going
to be the lips of course and for today
of using the Oprah liquid lipstick in
the shade so this is not a first
impressions obviously I love Oprah and
you guys know you can use coach azar
server set up all over lip products they
are so fun I actually did not receive
any new lip products in any PR packages
recently so yeah and then of course to
finish off this look we're going to use
our Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray to lock her face in place all
night long
alright guys and that is it burnt orange
of the top of a chartreuse liner cut
crease all complete damn that was a
mouthful I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video with me going over all these
new products and first impressions and
