and Huggy not because we love each other
because we were both horrified yeah
we're about to do something that no
beauty guru has ever done before a
beauty guru now no job no straight in
your community right the community is
just fine today we were building a get
ready with us in our private helicopter
I don't like Heights
Tanner doesn't either I don't know how
we did this literally Tanika not even
convinced you to paper and uber SUV so I
don't know how I just bookies before
chopping come on we're not gonna be the
next brand I'll use code sister James
for a helicopter I'm honestly horrified
but there's no other person in the
entire world that I want to be doing
this with wanna see yo if we go down we
go down together sister city
mom and dad sisters I love you guys all
so much if I die you probably my legend
it's too late my sister Lisa if I die
mom and dad and sisters I love you guys
so much and I think we've had enough of
the ground with the prince boring
yeah the grounds so boring I totally
want to be in there ain't no do they
make up let's go
and I love the ground
I needed a friend to talk to and almost
at four hours late to the conversation
a lot of you know I've always had the
business mindset that I do now and I
make money off of that when I was 11
I was like oh marketing and it's just to
get people really talking I think you're
very much the same way and this people
like they hate us we're gonna keep
coming back and watching there's a lot
of marketing that goes into what we do
that people may not understand
I think one of things for me is that
what other brands work with me or
somebody's posting about me oh my god
yes I absolutely have if you took three
seconds to do research you
that's James Charles
I'm sorry on the ground
you know your makeup
the lighting is probably pretty harsh
oh my god okay that's I make sure when
taking the photo
to like lean back so we're like my
shoulders are significantly at an angle
behind like my legs and ass and then
flex my stomach muscles so that the
first thing I can do in space is detail
so it looks like it's pretty crazy
though I feel like in LA especially know
what I think it's so funny when I get
called up for all the time it's like oh
my god hello like I look amazing do I
think I look like that person but I
think of students 3 everybody I've seen
all your faves before and afters oh I
see everybody's because I added a lot of
people's pictures edit but just know and
sister days behind the pace tune of a
lot of different people you guys like
what I see the reporters in this what do
you guys think my neurotic oh you're
it's wrong with everything you almost
get it which is toxic it's not okay
but it's like it becomes easier to just
take the latter option because you don't
want to deal with the criticism it's
like people criticize you until they
push you to a point where they for you
to expect perfection of yourself puts up
when you're acting like that
they're mad at you and they call you
think that's that brings us back to our
very first
oh god are you putting on boxes already
first of all I brought lashes that I
already wore like last week which I just
don't think is the best
oh my god I look into the winged
eyeliner look hello look at her she's
good use Wow I'm a bigot I was at Mui
I'm scared to try to do this a cab we're
getting a lot of turbulence right now
I'm spooks
out of your hair just stay on top at the
Fletcher self
not only is your makeup gonna kill the
party that you're gonna go to but it's
my fly in there all I need in my life to
be all the time is a helicopter I don't
have lip color
Animoto annoying Charles for two minutes
in the sky yeah you guys we see the
ground
I'll pick up her landing oh my god I
still have my lips today well I'm not
done I put on some Burt's Bees chapstick
pinched my eyelashes and I'm ready for
landing

house that was the joke Road thank God
barely why can't God heaven we're happy
to be on the ground in my entire life

ever gone or we expect her to go that
route I really like this is a different
side to both of us and I really hope you

fact that we did this in a helicopter I
like my makeup generally does not look
that bad and I'm honestly kind of happy
