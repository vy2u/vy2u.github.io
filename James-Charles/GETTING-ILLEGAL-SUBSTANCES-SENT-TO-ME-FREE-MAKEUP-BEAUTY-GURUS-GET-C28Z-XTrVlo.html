welcome back to my youtube channel so do
you guys know I did recently switch over
to doing three videos a week which is
such a fun challenge for me it is truly
so much more work than I was
anticipating but I'm absolutely loving
making all these videos for you guys and
I really hope you are enjoying them as
well speaking of making a lot of videos
for the fasting videos they've all been
a super super makeup and glam oriented I
mean I even jumped in a freaking pool as
a full face makeup on to show you guys
that waterproof makeup is possible
definitely check that video out if you
have not already but for today's did it
I wanted to just sit down throw on some
likely I'm reducing a little bit more
personal with you guys a few videos ago
I did a more personal Q&amp;amp;A where I insert
a lot of questions that you guys wanted
to know about being an influencer being
a beauty guru and just kind of questions
in general that nobody really really
likes to answer or give the honest truth
to I don't actually think I answer any
other questions in the actual video
oopsies but I know I did get a ton of
questions about PR packages getting free
makeup for brands what that entails is a
sponsored yada yada yada so for today's
video I thought I would unbox the bunch
of PR package that I've been saving for
the last few weeks it's been like three
weeks since I've actually unboxed any
new products I've been dying to get my
hands on these and do some swatches so
without further ado let's show you guys
when the free makeup that I get on a
daily basis the first package to open it
to my babes over at Benefit Cosmetics
and I'm so frickin excited to open this
because I just love benefits so much and
they're PR packages are literally always
so adorable if you guys follow me on
staff I've done a few unboxings over
there and they're always so well thought
out and put together they have by far
one of the strongest PR teams of any
brand I know so definitely a major left
to benefit and you didn't hear this from
me but you may want to keep your eyes
peeled for something with James and
benefit coming soon so in the box from
the little crows that says sister James
enjoy the new goodies XOXO is sister
Stephanie and in here we have blue for
festival makeup so I guess this might be
their new Porefessional light I think
there are three of them and they come in
one two and three if you can see it on
the top
I guess one for you two in this case but
these are the pore fessional pore
minimizing makeup and I guess this is a
3-step system so the Bacchus eyes makeup
to minimize the appearance of pores you
know sister James could definitely use
some help in that area and it says
covers imperfections without falling in
pores and that is step one step two
smooth
to the look of pores and step three
instantly modifies and controls access
service oil for eight hours okay that's
a big claim
I'm so confused Oh press Oh
okay so number three is obviously a
liquid I have no idea what numbers 1 &amp;amp; 2
are but I definitely want to find out
because like I said it's sister James
definitely need some help in the port
department that is for store so if you
guys want to see me try these out soon
definitely let me know all right so our
next talk is from sister Lilly ghalichi
over at Lilly lashes I'm located for
this hopefully there's some Miami's in
here because the sister is running a
real low okay we have a little club that
says James on it and then oh they're all
Miami's oh my god that is really what I
needed the card says hi my gorgeous
sister James these brands are really
know about we wanted to not be office
all your fav Lily lashes and of course
it's on Miami state lands
xoxo Lily and the lower lashes team true
sisters thank you so much to the Lily
lashes team I was definitely running low
in Miami's and Lord knows at this point
I am probably going to be buried wearing
apparently so definitely needed to
restock all so I reached out slowly
because I wear these launches all the
time as you guys know and I get so many
questions every time I wear them as well
so they utterly lost it in the style
mink Miami and as well you can now use
coatings for 10% off your purchase of
all lashes it lately lashes so
definitely check these out they're by
far my favorite pair always does the sex
talk she's happily a pretty pretty big
one and this one is from lecture so
inside comes a beautiful box which my
dumb ass accidentally just ripped but it
was beautiful about 30 seconds ago all
right so this is actually my first ever
PR package from Tasha you guys know I'd
like to be very very unbiased when it
comes to this stuff but I will say I am
very very very excited to open this I've
heard that their skin care stuff is so
good and you guys know that I don't
really do skincare and I definitely
didn't want to start it so this is a
perfect excuse to do so and let's open
this up and it comes this card and it
says oh my gosh sisters I love that all
these brands know me so well this is oh
my gosh sisters brand new basis for our
fav rise and glow James Charles
oh my god also in the Box comes this
really really beautiful container which
looks like it is a math gap it is the
violet C radiance mask and by the name
of was doing it as a brightening mouth
for sure this looks so good I'm going to
open up so wonder if it's actually a
violet oh it is oh wow that is so pretty
definitely we try this out very very
soon thank you so much Tantra for the
package and yoli glow you better hit me
up student sister alright so the next
package once again are pretty pretty big
one and it's also very very heavy too I
don't recognize the name on this box so
I have no idea what this is or how they
got my address in the first place let's
go ahead and open this up what is this
the first thing I see is this pamphlet
that has a marijuana leaf on it and now
I'm horrified it's just literally a PR
package of drugs telling this doesn't
look like the most illegal medicine that
has ever been sent in the mail are you
kidding this is CBD syrup all natural
hemp wait a second you guys know sister
James does not do drugs or drink I'm a
good boy but if I remember correctly
from last year science class I'm pretty
sure that hemp is like in weed it's just
literally a package of marijuana okay at
this point I am convinced and also
horrified that I may have just received
a package of illegal substances to my
apartment so I'm going to read this
pamphlet now all the way through and see
what the tea is because this is not what
I want
this cloud9 syrup is the number one
selling shampoo syrup infused as pure
hemp CBD and 9 all natural herbs it's
legal and ok that's what I needed to
hear it's legal and safe to use a
positive health benefits that support
increase in happiness temporary relief
as well as many ailments extreme
relaxation as well as amazing flavors
that you mix with your favorite drinks
that you'll love our kid ladle that's
simply cannabis we're box is a weird
thing ok so what I'm gathering here is
that these substances are legal which is
wonderful that means I won't be doing
when we cup from a jail cell thank God
I'm still not exactly hundred percent
sure what these actually are I was going
to go ahead and put this box away you
guys can put whatever senses you want on
your body but sister Jane is going to
say clean alright so the sex packages
from our stitches over anasazi a Beverly
Hills and I think I know what this is
and I'm so excited to open this up
alright so this is the box that comes
inside of the boss and their packaging
is always so beautiful so sleek and just
super super modern into plastic and I
love that yes oh my god it is what I
thought it is they're brand new
honest honest get liquid glow
illuminators I am so excited for these
so it looks like these liquid glow
illuminators come in four different
shades being called pearl oyster bronze
and peach fit and I've been waiting for
these for so long following the anasazi
snaps an Instagram page they looked a
little e so Bob on all the promo
pictures and you guys know that their
illuminator in so Hollywood is by far my
favorite highlighter ever I'm wearing it
today as always so honest alia
definitely does not play around when it
comes to back glow let's go ahead and
try one of these out looking at the
little color things on the top it's
looking like peach visit probably be the
best match for a James Charles skin tone
highlight so let's cover out of the box
oh my god this is actually huge too for
a liquid highlighter it's 0.628 fluid
ounces which is literally almost the
same size as most foundations that's
really crazy I'm gonna squeeze a little
bit of peaches on back of my hand
oh wow oh wow
you can Lucy just me will be my hand I'm
looking at the monitor right now against
the light these are so metallic and
beautiful I'm shook to the core this is
like blinding next-level highway right
now the Formosan is really really nice
it's definitely a very very creamy
consistency and not too liquidy as well
which is wonderful that means it's not
going to move around on the face I mean
I love a good highlighter but we're not
trying to do the full face of how
they're challenged every day I
definitely am a little bit concerned
though being that this is one of the
lighter shades of the collection and as
you can see when the light isn't hitting
it it definitely leaves a pretty pretty
dark reflection so I'm very curious to
see how that will actually look on my
skin I will definitely try those out
very very soon but let me know if you
guys want to see a video with those
always the last but certainly not least
we have this package from our sisters
over at makeup forever and just like
with benefit makeup ever is one of those
companies that truly does have such an
amazing PR team they really do care
about their customers and their
influences which is so amazing and it's
like the best quality a brand can have
but all personal bias aside let's get to
the makeup oh my god if this is what I
think it is this is something very very
very special so there's a little card
inside that says we asked six of our
friends to make the perfect artist based
color palette so here's how I made their
show us how you make yours from makeup
forever oh my god so not only do we have
sister Kim who created her little trio
but we also have sister Cassie so if I'm
reading this correctly all six
influences created a trio of a bronzer a
blush and a high
and Cassie says I love how the
versatility of my artists phase color
trio palette can be applied with a
subtle touch for super soft slam or
kicked up a notch for a little more
intensity love that all three sheets
conveniently fit in a small compact
palette perfect for a vanity theme or
tucked in as well make up at 4 on the go
I'm obsessed with H 102 highly f-116
sculpt and beep 208 blush and I hope you
love them just as much as I do major
hard core cheesy moment right here
volumes sold beyond pronto sister Kathy
she's by far one of the most health and
makeup artists that I know if you guys
don't already follow her you need to go
check her out and I cannot believe I'm
looking at her beautiful face on this PR
package and just let you know I may or
may not have taken this photo so the
package came with a nine different
products being three highlighters three
contours and three blushes and these are
the three that sister Kathy paired
together but I'm not just going to open
it up because I definitely do want to
use them soon but these colors are
beautiful and I cannot wait to put them
on my face alright this is so that has
all the pr packages we have to open
today i really really hope you enjoyed
this little unboxing video we saw all
sorts of funky products from
pore-minimizing makeup face masks drugs
and even make up for all my best friends
in the entire world so this was so much
fun to open up and see all these new
products if you guys enjoy this video

thumbs up down below it really helps me
out and as well if you would like to see
me actually use all these products and
test them out do some live swatches on
