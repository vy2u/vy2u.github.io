welcome back to my youtube channel as
you can see so they have a very very
special guest today this is Hannah a
living legend and she's actually the
winner of my fan I hate the word fan my
sister makeover giveaway she's here we
have our paint rings and we were ready
to get clam today I am so excited that
you were here you came all the way from
where Pennsylvania in the middle of
nowhere huh I'm so excited we are here
in California together we are at my
friends warehouse were filming it this
makeup transformation and then also a
little wardrobe transformation as well
this is gonna be a full day a full glam
makeover and I am so beyond excited how
are you feeling I know I texted her
earlier today and I was like what kind
of look do you want and you basically
just told me really really light
beautiful glam huh
that's the third makeup usually like
tell me about like your normal everyday
makeup routine blow though a very extra
but at the same time not too much yes
love that oh my god I seen her in
certain like you're always rocking like
that fierce winged liner like your brows
with your foundation so buy a beautiful
sky thank you seriously unfortunately
but we're gonna like you look so freakin
about tonight it's so calm so let's
simplify it having your face you think
the benefit Porefessional primer my
relation like a thousand maybe whoa yeah
that's so crazy that's the big city
around where we lived my time growing up
was like very very small but I still had
like the smallest consider 30,000 people
Oh
so for foundation obviously a reason the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
stick not on the shade why 315 today
because anna is a pale beauty she's poor
slim again so I have a for chasing me I
have y 2o 5 to 15 at 225 and 245 ever
test them and see which one matches the
best which is 225 and the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation stick so you
can use this one all over your face
without further ado let's go man really
I love that you're like so not afraid to
like rock luckily I'm full of freaking
coverage love I think there are so many
people especially nowadays that are like
I can't believe never serious on that
one well especially like in like
Pennsylvania if you're wearing a lot of
makeup that immediately makes you like
like if you went to school like that and
everything yeah
you'd get called so many names because
that's just not normal
see when I was actually in high school I
think I only wore makeup to school twice
I I mean either I never cared that yeah
oh I was I literally didn't wear because
I was too lazy to yeah like when you
don't have any hair it's not like I can
do my hair up all night oh my god
speaking of it looks like what the
comedy on the original video because
obviously so inspire them um I wrote I
suffer from a location just lost all my
hair to the condition I cried for hours
because I felt like my long hair to find
my beauty I felt embarrassed to leave
the house without a wig makeup helps me
walk out the door every day and still
feel like a queen without my hair it is
a huge stress relief doing my makeup in
the morning and feeling confident enough
to go out with my friends and be myself
I honestly would be hiding in my house
if it weren't for makeup and amazing
people like you to make me feel
beautiful I love you James oh yeah I
love that confidence because like most
people like obviously like it's a very
very hard disease for a lot of people to
do and like truly does show like certain
like body parts or accessories like
aren't needed or that's what we're to
put it but certain things are needed for
video yeah that's like staring septic
you don't need long flowy curly locks to
be beautiful like you don't need like a
beef AC beautiful either like I love it
you're oh that's just so interesting so
much I'm so so freaking happy that
you're here when if you don't be asking
when were you diagnosed alopecia is like
yeah tell me about it cuz I love it I'm
just to be honest I really I'm not
familiar with it I never really went to
get diagnosed per se because I was kind
of like
Barriss at the time especially when I
first got it but I mean especially I
mean I've been told by my just family
doctor there's nothing else that it
could be right so I mean obviously
that's what it is but um
alopecia areata is the type that I have
which is just the way that it falls out
is the second word areata means it falls
out in circles throughout your head okay
Wow
five months ago now that is I was was
when the first patch fell out so this is
recent oh yeah okay okay and about three
months after that I decided to
completely shave my head for the first
time lava yeah because I most of my hair
had already fallen out and I believe
that there was just no point in keeping
it through the rest of it because I mean
I thought I looked more like a goofball
with like just three patches of hair and
no hair at all no other rather just had
no hair at all yeah I was looking your
entry of the pictures when you were like
fully bald were so funny I felt like it
was just so cool it almost like we were
talking about drag or how like me
reminded very much like I'm gyre like
some oh yeah yeah just like and like
soft so that just like you guys are
looking you know here oh my god I felt
that are just like it was so cool and
it's so confidence you like just a young
girl o'clock you know you don't care at
all that's so awesome
oh my god her bronzer today I brought my
benefit hoola lights antenna is more
fair skin I don't want to use regular
glue because it'll probably make you
look really really orange so they just
released their today what light version
would I actually have been loving I use
it on myself yesterday for the first
time woman back in the day I feel like
contouring like wasn't a thing like I
was definitely like I started doing
makeup right when all this started
coming out that like you can set your
face with setting spray like a new
freaking revelation there's so many like
makeup advances and trying to I don't
know where it all came with the exact
same time yeah well like I even remember
it like there is no such thing as primer
when I are doing makeup like I remember
starting in life there only being like
Porefessional was around even like you
know I'm like I think 2015 I want to see
the Smashbox ones and I was like the
only popular one
I was like every brand it's definitely
true when you see the like on Instagram
about everybody we had to go through the
UH the ugly stages and now all these
kids are not going to do this it's not
fair at least everybody's gift that I'm
definitely friends with wild like
musically kids mm-hmm and they're all
like 12 and they're all yeah like top
models look you ready to walk a runway
like what is in your baby formula I like
they all are so beautiful and something
I'm like like this really so I heard you
got a very interesting a prom alpha oh
yes tell me about it
I wore a Cinderella dress and a giant
bedazzled headband love with my
completely shaved down bald head Wow
well insert picture right oh that's kind
of everything can't relate unfortunately
I took that my best friends are prom and
she was the girl I love I know you have
a braver like distinct brown style like
I'm looking at your into your like they
always look very good and like they
never change
thank you which like makes me nervous
because I was like oh yeah that's like
the easiest step of mine okay so I used
to shave my eyebrows off completely for
like two years
Geoffrey start is shaking hello
oh hey Geoffrey oh my god okay yeah yeah
I'll let her know
he's doing just fine oh poor hands I
thought that arm using the brand new
Urban Decay Naked heat i palette this is
enough that I have on my eyes right now
I used this for the first time this
morning and I'm loving how my look
turned out so we're gonna give him a
very similar look
she asked for a light glam just like
very very pretty but not too much
which love easy peasy I first met her on
my morphe my o-73 brush used to put in
10% off and dip into this unit saw
straight up in here just for a light
transition
so I know - I thought you're not rocking
nails huh no but usually you have like
claws on normally I get as long as they
possibly can make them we just have like
the little salons that like in Walmart
that will dip your nails I don't know
yeah we're gonna take you to a good
thought oh we got a BB gun so long next
to the road my movie m151 Russian dip
into the shade and wake up and ashes and
mix them together
this smell is honestly it's so stunning
I saw a lot of mixed reviews on it I
personally really really loved it I mean
I love this total blotting brush as well
I feel like it's just so good to do like
little detail work but still flooding at
the same time one of my faves I'm gonna
go into this steel up magnificent Mel's
in the shade kin karma these things are
so pretty and you're just you know why'd
you just tell me and like we only have
one Sephora near me and it's like two
hours away and I went in to get fees and
at like we went in like three different
times to go get these and they were also
about every single time and for one
final glitter and the inner corner we go
to the urban decay a Midnight Cowboy
liner and is there over top of the Stila
thing that's at the upper shadows all
done we're gonna want to give Hanna a
winged liner because she's always
rocking a fierce a swing something's
gonna try to recreate this the best I
can today and do her some justice I'm so
reason the acav on D a tattoo ink liner
a letter come on Dee sister is literally
drying out as I did her wing I've had
this one for a long time now
so I my tried and true it's time to buy
a restock anyway I'm fine
I'm gonna need her to last for one more
make up this side so girl let's pray she
pulls through okay let's do this lower
lash now I just have to lower lash then
I'm gonna go back in with sauce on my
233 brush and just give it a light wash
the color on Hannah lower lashline then
just a find the outer lower corner I'm
gonna use my morphe r43 brush and dip
into n Fuego and ashes similar to the
upper lash line and just define it just
the outer edge I'm just gonna press this
into Hannah's lash line to make her
lower lashes look really really smoked
up and defined Hannah already has huge
beautiful eye so when my look I put on
white liner on the waterline for
Hannah's I'm actually gonna leave her
water light blank now the Hannah shadows
all complete I'm gonna go ahead and do
some lashes and of course when were
using the Lily lashes in the South Miami
these are my all-time faves and I were
in there right now so I want to make her
how long has it been since you were
called suju's you just were like mascara
curl them yeah no I don't curl them
either my girl
so you dis referred to destiny toes like
a new song right did you like just here
recently like how we should have
something like did you just hear justice
if you like yeah and that's just getting
on the radio how much how old is that
we've had it for like a good like it's
like it's like it already like how does
like peak time and I was like kind of
fading out that's hilarious because I
just heard it for the first time on the
way here in Italy the song was spreading
ad Esposito so that is one eye all
completely uncertain out we're gonna go
ahead and do the other one off-camera
just save some time that'll we'll be
right back to finish off the rest of the
video now that we have you both of
Hannah's eyes all done and snatch for
the gods we're now gonna go in with the
highlighter and to narrative using the
Oprah Beverly Hills illuminator and my
morphe M 501 brush I'm just going to top
into this light champagne you shape up
in here and a little bit of the white as
well just because Canada is later skin
so you wanna make sure it's not too dark
girls will get that gray cast which is
the worst thing in the world
so you're saying earlier like you are
known for your like
good glow huh oh yes I love a good
yellow toned blinding hi I was like yes
what are like your favorite highlighters
the eyeliner have been obsessed with I
don't even know the name of it I bought
it in Ireland when I went there on
vacation a while ago and it like doesn't
even have a company name on it or
anything yet but I'm obsessed with it I
don't even care
so our next up is going to be the lipid
II due to us to finish off this look and
I'm gonna first start off by lighting
that using the Isla 78 color pop
collection I freaking love this lip
pencil is all my all-time favorite
shades
and then in the center and over top
arena layer the colour-pop ultra satin
lip in the shade likey like likely just
kidding

beautiful and done we have to set her in
place using our Urban Decay all nighter
