welcome back to my youtube channel
cutting right to the foyer for today's
video I wanted to sit down at this to
some type of glam look I feel like for
the past several several videos I've
been wearing a super super light glam I
mean it is honestly been weeks since I
put on eyeshadow which is absolutely
horrifying considering my job is
literally makeup artist I put together
this winged out bronzy Hospital crease I
looked at I absolutely am in love with
and then I added these gold little star
freckles which you will see later on in
this video which is such a cute little
touch that I am so in love with and then
I just paired it with this nude lip and
this is the look that I came up with I'm
getting like very very summery festival
vibes
I know summer is like basically over
with and that means back to school
season is coming who checked out last
exhibit after needed tutorial on it but
I figured I would do this little
festival kind of inspired look just to
bring us off to the good old days all
those being said if you guys would like
to see how I created this look make sure
you keep on watching so to start off I
already went ahead and I primed my face
using my moisturizer and then I'm going
to go in with my Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD stick in the shade of y 365 for a
base it's actually been so long since
I've done a full coverage glam I feel
like I've only been doing a light
building natural glam for a very long
time now so I'm super excited to
actually be doing a real look today and
this is going to be a super super fun
one as well I'm also going to grab a
little bit of Too Faced board and so a
foundation in the shade and natural
beige and just a little bit on the back
of my hand and I'm going to dip into my
Beauty Blender and kind of use the
foundation to blend out the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD stick these are both legs
of your foundations for very different
reasons so I'm going to get the best of
both worlds today oh my god I can't
believe actually never tried mixing
these two foundations together I guess
I've never really thought about it
because the makeup everyone is a stick
and then the Too Faced one is a liquid
but my skin looks so good right now oh
my god to conceal today I'm going to
grab my ATAR shape tube concealer in the
shade light/medium honey and just
highlight the high points of my face
I don't know if it's all the studio
light that we added that I think if my
eyes about to see to me that we were
having a super super good skin day today
which makes me so happy
thank you for once in my life to lock
our face in place that are using of
course the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder during the summertime I
really like only setting up my nose area
and then under my eyes because those are
the two areas that definitely wear out
the fastest and get the most creases so
I really just like setting hair to lock
in place to that as for the rest my face
I literally just add the lightest layer
a powder possible if even powdering at
all because I really like the summer
doing foundation look as you guys know I
feel like it just looks so beautiful and
so natural and I am going to a party
slash event tonight that I'm going so
spit it for it is the desi and Katy dose
of colors launched I am so proud of them
and so stated to try the products but I
definitely need this foundation and
makeup look to last a very very long
time because it is early in the morning
today and I have to wear this at like 7
p.m. tonight so definitely keep this in
place I definitely want this look to be
super super golden and bronzy today so
of course we have to pack on the bronzer
and for this event is my benefit hoola
bronzer as always and I Murphy M for a
fire brush and you guys know you can use
code J's for 10% off all morphe brushes
since i didn't pack on the setting
powder today i'm being very very light
when i'm applying this bronzer because
if I dig it into my face too hard
it's definitely lead the powder looking
super super happy and I definitely want
it to cling onto the still kind of wet
foundation so I'm this being super super
light and letting that color get on
there naturally alright so let them to
you guys I literally just did exactly
what I said not to do and I was bronzing
to hard enough you can see right here on
camera my foundation that's coming up a
little bit and turning to separate so
I'm just going to lightly go over that
with the more setting powder just make
sure that area is really really locked
in place because I don't like foundation
to wear up next in the grab my Kat Von D
shade and light palette and my Anasazi a
22 brush and we dip into this light
yellow shade right up in here I guess
he's got a little bit to reinforce the
highlights on my face it's good to
reinforce those highlights that we
originally put on with a concealer just
because after bronzer and contour that
brightness can sometimes get lost
amongst the blending and everything so
it's always good to reinforce and make
sure we are snatched and fully chiseled
I'm left to grab my luck c180 nose
contouring brush and dip into it the
middle shade and the left shape of the
shade of a palette and then lightly come
to my nose
I'm going to have a little bit more
lower Mirsky pedo and just lightly baked
besides my nose just to make sure it's
really really locked in a place
I guess might as well go really pull
down bake the rest nine days - it has
only been a hot minute why not I just
went ahead and did my eyebrows
off-camera you guys do me do them
literally a million times I figured
might as well just skip out on it today
as well I kind of want to cry right now
because I literally just did my entire
eye on camera and explained everything
always realized I wasn't actually
recording so normally my videos don't go
in this order normally I do one on
camera then off I guess what I has
already done so now we're going to do
the other one on camera again but this
time we better be recording I'm going to
turn off with my umm 4-3-3 brush and
dipping into the jacqueline help palette
I'll let her grab this kind of mac and
cheese type shade or going to put that
all up in the crease I'm literally so
annoyed right now because doing eye
looks on camera and having to say
everything though he takes me forever
but I can literally recreate the same I
look off-camera and like ten minutes no
matter what I look at is so I know I'm
going to be late to my event now and
this is not what I wanted to happen I'm
not for me another M four three three
brush and we're going to dip into this
orange shade right up in here and put
that in the crease once again to deepen
it out when I get to this outer corner
I'm going to wing out the shadow quite a
bit because we want that like blended
out festival type makeup look that's I'm
going to different to this warm tone
Brown shave it up in here and start to
deepen out the outer corner and blend
that up a little bit into the crease
then apply m56 - I'm just going to blend
out those edges using my M 509 brush I'm
just going to have the slightest bit of
the black shape on the bottom corner and
just even on the very very very outer V
I'm going to be super super careful
discolor because adding too much block
can really ruin this look very very very
quickly and this black in this palette
is super super pigmented as well so I'm
just going to add a light amount and
then blend it out like I said I'm being
super super careful and letting this out
I definitely am NOT going for a block
smokey eye look today maybe that's next
video but for now I just want to do sign
up that outer corner so adding block is
really really risky but it definitely
looks great if you do it right I'm going
to add some little on top of the lid but
at the base I'm going to go to my morphe
35o palette and my makeup Shack t6 brush
I'm going to dip into this orange shade
in the bottom right corner and just use
it to carve out the crease oh the shadow
is literally so pretty oh my god
once I shot us on there I'm just going
to grab a clean a blending brush and go
right over those edges to make sure
everything is really really diffused and
blended out except for the crease
obviously but that's kind of the whole
point to add a little bit of glitter and
more pops as I look I'm going to grab
these steal at liquid glitters stuff and
rose gold retro you guys know these are
so bomb and this will lightly pop this
over top of that shadow
oh yeah well that is are looking for
that looks so pretty for the lower loss
that I'm going to go into my I'm 4 3 3
and dip into that burnt orange shade at
once again and just put a little bit of
it down right after I destroy the split
or fall out oh my I'm definitely gonna
hug the shadow very very close to the
lash line when I get to this outer
corner I'm also going to build it up
into this dark on our wing portion it
being a very very careful to not really
take it down into this area
just think I kind of just did because
that's when things are getting really
really muddy like right here but no
worries we're going to fix it next thing
around my own 509 brush and dip into the
circle and shade right here and define
at the very very upper lashline lower
lashline then as I am 1 for 9 and a
little bit of burnt orange and it sculpt
on that out because once again we
definitely don't want a black smoky eye
one trick that I love to do is drive in
my Beauty Blender and a little bit more
of that translucent powder that I use
doesn't matter which one and I'm just
going to put a little bit of powder
right underneath that shadow to kind of
bake it and lighting it back up to skin
tone and this will actually really do a
good job of cleaning everything up and
then finally I'm going to grab my next
wonder pencil in the lightest shade and
I'm going to use this to a line at my
waterline
senses look as super super intense and
dark on those outer corners I definitely
wanna use a lighter color in the
waterline to open my eyes back up we're
also going to look super super small and
tiny for mascara today I'm going to do a
light coat of benefit roller lash to
Greg note this is my all time save and
then for lashes a bit of pop of my house
lashes iconic light it has been so long
since I've used these lashes and I'm
honestly so plated I'm getting like so
much nostalgia
I feel like I've been using Lilly lot of
Miami's for the past 6 64 years straight
so it's time for a little bit of a
switch out
for that classic golden glow of course
you guys are going to using the Anasazi
estelle hollywood illuminator i use this
all the time like literally in every
single video but it truly is so good and
it works really perfectly to my skin
tone as well I find that oftentimes a
lot of highlighters can leave a gray
cast on my skin because I do have a
pretty light skin or it'll just look
really wonky done or so definitely would
recommend until Hollywood oh these look
pretty good those I'm a forced to put
this on my brow bone as well you guys
know the drill by now I'm also going to
highlight my nose using my Emma for 3/1
brush alright so that is we go all
complete and before we actually move on
to the lips
I do introducing a little bit fun for
this look if you guys follow me on
snapchat you know that this whole
redoing my set up process has been quite
the process yes a few weeks ago mr. Kate
came over and actually helped me
rearrange its entire Beauty room and now
I've actually rearranged again
but regardless they've always been one
of my favorite channels I love the
videos so freaking much and they have
been a major source of inspiration for
all my apartment decorating stuff and
when King was over she did give me her
little mr.kia beauty mark stickers and I
did test these out earlier on I'm going
to be putting these like little gold
stars up in here on my Halle area
because why not this is my little pair
of eyelash pieces and I'm going to cut
out my stars I just remove the plastic
flow from the top as well and then I'm
just going to place it on my skin where
I want it and I think I'm going to put
this right over here on my highlight
region and then I'm just gonna hold it
in place and I have a damp towel here
and I'm just going to press this right
into the skin I tested this out earlier
as well before I actually did this whole
look to make sure that this one mess up
my entire face the foundation and it did
not it looked super super great so I am
not worried I am just being really
really careful because obviously we
don't want our entire face to get what
just the part that has the little
sticker on it as you learned in my video
from a few weeks ago most makeup is
definitely waterproof this is literally
exactly all the temporary tattoos that
we all didn't wear like eight years old
but just a whole lot prettier all right
and once you put on first 30 seconds I'm
just going to give it a good little pat
and then peel it off yes I love all
these gold freckles from out there doing
so
frickin cute if you guys want to check
out mr. cape please I'll leave her stuff
down below her channel is so amazing and
so is her shop as well and by the way
speaking of it down below
from now on all products that I use in
all my tutorials will be listed in the
description so if you see something that
I'm using or you want to shop anything
that I'm using always checks down below
first obviously the eyes on the face are
very very bold so for the lips today I
definitely wanna keep a light nude so
I'm first gonna start by lining my lips
using the Mac lip pencil in the shade
whirl alright and last up finally at
least I'm going to set my face in place
using my morphe preppin set setting
spray alright sisters and that is this a
bronzy gold festival style makeup look I
don't know what the hell to call it's
all complete I really really love how
this turned out especially the gold
freckled today's video is absolutely
