hi guys its James Charles welcome back
to my youtube channel first off I just
want to say it thank you guys so much
for 200,000 subscribers that is so
ridiculous and I am so thankful for all
of you guys I know I have not been the
best youtuber in the past and I know I
keep saying I'm going to try and now I
really truly am because now there's so
many of you guys watching and I really
want to make sure that I am putting out
the best content possible so thank you
guys and I am so excited to put out more
amazing videos and show you guys so many
tutorials and show you all what I have
in store however that being said a lot
of my past videos have been some crazy
outside of the box looks which I know
you guys and myself obviously love so
for today's video I really want to tone
it down just a little bit and doing more
classic but still gorgeous glam look
which is perfect for the upcoming
holiday season
I created this dark cranberry smokey eye
with double glitter liner glow of course
in this dark purple lip I absolutely
love how it turned out as always all
products and discount codes will be
listed in the description below and if
you want to see how I created this look
make sure you keep on watching to start
off this tutorial today I'm going to
begin with my morphe 35o palette and
just wanted the light orange shades on
my morphe m4 4-1 brush this brush is
great for blending out creases and that
is exactly what I'm doing so I'm just
putting the shade right into the crease
using windshield wiper motions and
circular motions to really blow this
color out we want everything to be nice
and blended I'm then going with the
darker one shade on my M 4-3-3 brush and
it defining the creates just a little
bit more same type of motions there's
going to be a lot of different colors
going on to this I want to make sure
everything is seamlessly blended
together and then with that excess color
I'm just going back in and I'm going to
shade in the eyelid same brush same
exact color once we have those colors
placed on there I'm going back into the
m4 for one and the light orange
transition shade I'm going to buff over
those edges to really make sure
everything is nice and blended out to
begin my lower lash in I'm going into my
m4 33 and the dark orange shade from the
35o palette and I'm going to begin to
buff it into the lash line I'm not going
to go all the way into the inner corner
however because we are going to be
putting a pop of highlighter there and I
really want to make sure my eyes look
nice and open
same thing from before I'm using my m4
for one in the light orange shade just
to buff over the edges to make sure
everything is super blended out we
really don't want any harsh edges with
this and it's really going to come in
handy when we add the purples which is
going to be right now I'm going into the
dark purple shade from the 35b palette
friendly reminder you can use code James
for 10% off all more free products I'm
just using my m4 33 and brushing the
shade all over the lid just to create a
nice cranberry color repeating that same
step again I'm going back into that dark
purple shade on the m4 33 and just
dusting that shade lightly onto the
lower lash line I'm once again not
focusing that on the inner corner but
rather the outer and kind of creating
that v-shape that we know and love
unlike all of my J Charles eye tutorials
to finish off the eye shadow portion of
the slug I'm going with my m56 to brush
and the red change from the 35p palette
and dusting this in the crease this is
really going to help the purple and the
orange blend together and kind of create
this like blended sunset smokey eye type
of situation you get what I'm saying you
know we're just going to move right out
of the liner I'm using the morphe gel
liner in Slate and my m25 zero dust your
brush to create this sharp and on fleek
weight I am drawing the swing pretty
thin because I am going to be doing a
double liner and I'm going to be using a
glitter so I'm just kind of try to keep
this pretty like subtle so it's not like
over attacking my eye this force over is
seriously a mess I apologize it is very
very late at night I just returned from
my trip so give me a chance and I also
ordered a microphone as well so these
voiceovers are soon going to be a lot
better quality yeah I heard you guys
talking about it and I promise I'm
working on it anyways I'm now taking my
M 213 brush and taking that dark purple
shade that I was using before and
buffing out that black liner that I put
in the waterline just to create a nice
even transition and make that bottom
waterline SuperDuper smoky and dark then
to make sure that is nice and blended
out and that I don't have a block I I'm
just going in once again with the m56 -
and the red shade from the 35b and just
buffing over that line SuperDuper
lightly for the double glitter liner
portion of this look I'm going with my
Mac mixing medium on my morphe gel liner
brush obviously not the same one that
had the black liner on it from before
and I'm just dipping it to my copper a
lot glitter from violet Voss I figured
this glitter would match absolutely
perfectly with the cranberry and the red
and it did I really really love how this
looked I'm just super carefully laying
glitter right over top of the black
liner being pretty careful to avoid
fallout but to fix it up I'm going with
my NYC liquid liner obviously in black
this liner is super duper opaque so it
really helps to cover over any follow on
that black liner from the glitter after
putting on mascara I'm just quickly
popping on a pair of false lashes I
honestly do not remember where these are
from but if I can find the name I will
leave it in the description below I've
been wearing these for a few weeks now
and I do not remember I lost the box but
they are pretty similar to house lashes
ikonics so definitely check those out if
you have not already and that is one eye
all completed I'm gonna go and do the
other one off-camera that we can go
ahead and get started on the rest of the
face BAM thank God for movie magic for
my highlighter today I'm going to my M
501 brush for more feet and my Anasazi
illuminator in so Hollywood you guys
know this is like my all-time favorite
combo for glowing golden skin to finish
off this look I'm using my over liquid
lipstick in the shade of Queens it is
this beautiful dark purple shade I
absolutely love how this paired with
this look yeah that made sense right
okay anyways this ramallah is so bob and
you can use code Jay Charles for 30% off
