was that makeup artist seriously no
you're not lol did you train did you
study
or go to beauty school now so then
you're not classified as a makeup artist
if you haven't got the certificate and
paper to show it then it doesn't count
you as a makeup artist I would know
because I
rashon ever qualified makeup artists
he's right
really rashon because my 5.3 million
followers and this piece of paper beg to
differ hi sisters James Charles here and
welcome back to my youtube channel as
I'm sure you guys are very much aware
comments are a huge part of the YouTube
community I receive thousands and
thousands and thousands to come up with
every single video mostly from you guys
were always spreading so much love and
positivity and really make me at do what
I want to do so thank you for always
being the absolute best but alongside
the love also comes a whole lot of hate
comments when I was younger probably the
most valuable thing to my mother ever
taught me was if you don't have anything
nice to say don't say anything at all
for me personally I don't think I have
ever once left a hate comment on anybody
else's content that they worked really
really hard on but apparently that
lesson was not talked to the thousands
and thousands and thousands of people
who feel that they are just superior
beings and that they're unnecessary and
rude comments just need to be heard now
don't get me wrong there's definitely a
huge difference between constructive
criticism and hate comments for me
personally I love constructive criticism
I did this job every single day for you
guys in to inspire you guys all around
the world and if there's any way that I
can make my videos better my makeup
better my personality better my lighting
better I absolutely want to do it and
there's a very very nice way to leave
positive suggestions but for the most
part people don't know how to do that
because everyone's ego is just too large
including mine this idea came about how
beauty is good when I was reading
comments going to his video and somebody
proceeded there hey comment by literally
saying sister James I love you so much
but I just feel like this needed to be
fed I then wrote something very very
nice to you to creating myself my hard
work and my career needed
Oh Julia sweetie sue combs darling
pumpkin you needed to write that comment
actually um no nobody asked for your
opinion you didn't need to do anything
according to this a very official piece
of paper right here I am clearly a
certified Mui but according to the
YouTube comments
apparently so it's every other person
that watches my video so for today I
thought it'd be very very fun to do a
video inspired by you ki where I take a
bunch of comments from people that just
thought their opinions had to be heard
and apply those to my makeup routine
because apparently I can't do makeup
I'm just so excited to listen to all
these extremely talented and trained at
makeup artists tell me exactly what I
should be doing for a makeup routine
hopefully I'll look so much better than
normal and let's just jump right in
our first step as always is gonna be our
foundation and our base routine and I
definitely get a lot of comments about
my foundation in every single video I
can definitely admit I'm not the best at
foundation matching so I figured I would
take some advice from the comments today
this comment comes from Haley and she
says James I love you but your
foundation is ten shades too dark you
look burnt hmm I'm just gonna grab a
little bit of a lighter shade today and
apply this all over my face oh yeah this
is a way of better mastery I think
mm-hmm I mean after all the sister
scandals that I've had the last thing
that I want to add to that list is
culture appropriation so thank god we're
getting this advice now another one we
have for today is from Maria and she
says is it just me or does anybody else
think that this foundation shade is just
way too orange and blue boots are
shaking oh yeah looking back I think
Bria is definitely right when it comes
to this I mean it's not like I say in
every single video that I always like to
be a little bit more tan so thank God
she put in this out today let me see
what I can look for if I'm not going for
more of an orange foundation I think I
need to find something with more of a
pink undertone so let me see what I can
find you guys oh my god after three
years of doing beauty videos I think
we've finally officially from the
foundation shade that matches me
perfectly it's a miracle this next time
it comes from Shelby and she says James
you're a doll but sweetie and I'm not
saying this to be cruel or critical just
the experience of a viewer of course it
would be much more enjoyable watching if
you slow down way down you're talking
moving so fast your energy is so frantic
that for low key people like me it makes
watching you very very stressful your
kinetic energy is clearly very high and
I'm sure that you have to exert a lot of
effort and energy to slow it down
entertain it but I assure you it make
your video so much more enjoyable
between Hyper's be talking in your
thoughts hand move it's featured in
camera it's just a bit watch Han again
I'm not saying this to be mean a cooler
critical simply to share my experience
in watching your videos then give you a
little bit of input much love to you
sister Shelby Oh see this is a really
great example of constructive criticism
and I definitely get comments about this
feed am I talking a lot so let me see
what I can do to really help you guys
out because I've never want to make my
videos hard to watch
all right guys so my next stop in my
beauty routine it's going to be the
concealer and for today I want to use my
tart shade tape and the shade fair I'm
just going to take the wand and apply it
to all of the high points of my face I
am just trying a triangle or right
underneath my eyes and kind of filling
in a little bit just to bring some more
attention to that area I'm just putting
some in the center of my forehead and
I'm gonna put a line right down my nose
and then maybe just a little bit on my
chin to cover the five o'clock shadow
and then of course just gonna take my
damp Beauty Blender
and blend it out this next one comes
from Rebecca and she says holy Sh why
are you using so much powder I cannot
even imagine how cakey and horrible and
growth you look in person Oh Rebecca I
see myself in the mirror all the time
and I think I look pretty good but I
guess it means a lot more coming from
you guys who really see me all the time
so maybe I'll just write ooh use a
little bit less today mmm
you know what I think that's a lot
better Rebecca I think you'll like this
one girl these next comments are some of
my favorites and they were talking about
bronzing and contouring this first one
comes from Courtney and she says your
contour looks way too harsh holy crap
why does your forehead look like it got
burnt this one comes from Jonathan and
he says sweetie your nose contour isn't
fooling anybody yes I love it when you
guys leave me nasty comments about the
two things that I talk openly about
began to care about and try to fix his
contouring really means a lot and does a
lot for my self-esteem this last one
comes from Brianna and she said you're
literally red okay who I mean I thought
my contour looked pretty good but
clearly we have a lot to fix today
according to these professional anyways
so it looks like we need to make my
contour a little bit more cool toned I'm
a little bit less harsh and I need to
stop contouring my nose so tiny so let's
see what we can do oh my god yes slay
I'm contouring with the ashes I both
left my self-esteem
after this video and I think it looks so
good for the forehead I definitely don't
to look burst like ice we're just gonna
use like the littlest bad perfect not
gonna lie I am a little bit scared and
nervous to change up my nose contour but
I think Jonathan definitely knows what
he's talking about so I'm just gonna
give herself a more natural look today
oh my god wait I actually love it
Jonathan thank you so much holy crap I
thought my nose was snatched before but
how like this natural bigger the better
look I think it's just the way to go
from now on this next one it comes from
Orion's R and they said your contour
blush is horrible you put way too much
blush on so it looks like you've a red
cheek on your face and then your contour
is just a dark brown line on your face
it's barely even blended so you
shouldn't even be a makeup artist
because your face makeup is horrible the
only good thing about it is your
highlight thank you at least I'm doing
one thing right oh yes the haters are
all being blinded right now
well we love ass not sister alright guys
so next we have the brows which I'm
actually really really excited for have
you been following me for a very long
time on Instagram you know that my brows
have underwent such a major
transformation and it's honestly a lot
because of you guys and a lot of the
hate comments I receive at first I just
really could not take the constructive
criticism I thought my brows were so so
so beautiful but finally I realize that
there were literally just the worst this
first one comes from Baylin Kibeho and
she says bro if you don't fix your
 brows your eye look is so warm
and your brow color is ashy they're gray
ok this one comes from Emily and she
says anybody else think that he should
really maybe trim his eyebrow hair and
make them a little bit thinner they are
so super boxy nothing against him he's
so great but I think he would really
look much better smiley face this one
comes from melancholic Mexican there's a
scandal these eyebrows are way too thick
they're supposed to be thin like skinny
legend Mariah Carey true and finally we
have this one from I hate Aloha
and she says boy I think those eyebrows
need to be closer together ok so I
definitely don't want my brows to look
ashy today that is a major major nono so
instead of my regular brow pencil I grab
the matte lip pencil in the shade of
Burgundy this was just a little bit more
red tone so hopefully it'll match with
the I like that I do later on and then
according to everyone else they need to
be a little bit more arch a little bit
skinnier and closer together you know
we're really going for that look of like
raising your eyebrows at all times to
show everybody that I'm very very
interested in what they're having to say
there we go
super arch definitely a little bit
fairer than normal then bringing it
right back down oh my god yes that looks
so much better than normal
according to I hate Ulua they really
should be almost touching because you
Nawroz are very much back in style and
trend so really gonna do that there and
then of course we have to make them
eyebrow twins they can't be sister so
actually - exactly even well I think
that's the best I've ever looked ok so
pretty good right like we definitely did
a little bit of concealer just to clean
them up a little bit really just got a
sister snatch them
yes for all yes that is exactly what
we're going for today it's so good well
this eyebrow is just a skinny legend oh
my god Mariah whoo this is how close I
am to losing my mind wow I think this is
finally it since starting my Instagram
account three years ago I've just gotten
so many comments about my eyebrows being
too thick or not arched enough or just
too big and I've had so many brands not
repost me because of it and maybe
finally I'll have a chance in the beauty
real now thank you to everybody who
suggested this today because I love this
so now that eyebrows were hashtag on
fleek I think we were in a really good
place to start out the eye shadow so
this comment comes from Shannon and she
says you always do a half cut crease
holy is there anything else you can do
or are you really just not talented at
all
No
okay so I really want to add a winged
let's look I feel like it'll just pull
everything super super it together and
thank God we have coming from you guys
telling me how to do it so I don't do it
wrong and this one come from divine bond
dagger and this is on my drive video and
she says sister James your eyeliner
needs to be thicker okay no problem I
can definitely make it thicker thank you
and this one comes from Andrew and he
says girl why was your wing so sure you
really should have made a sharp enough
to cut up right so definitely to listen
to Andrew we need to make our line or
really a really long and then according
to it divined we need to make it really
thick so let's bring this just up and
really you know we love a thick sister
you know who cares about the hours of
time we spend on blending our eyeshadow
like wing liner is really aware its it
just really opens up the eye just frames
the face so well I definitely would say
winged liner make it nice and thick
every day Wow I think they were so right
my wings are big enough and sharp enough
to almost fly away I love that alright
so the eye look is almost complete and
I'm literally loving it so far and her
next it was going to be a lash it said
I'm actually really really excited for
this one because similar to brows I've
always charcoal just a little bit with
lashes when I first started doing makeup
I would always glue my eye shot and even
still to this day I have very very
sensitive eye so sometimes eyelashes
will come off or they won't sit right
and there's a little bit wonky so I'm
really looking forward to reading your
guys's advice Teddy and hopefully being
able to fix them this coming home from
Samuel and he says no sister the lashes
you chose for this look we're all wrong
they close off your eyes making them
appear smaller you should have used a
way bigger lash that flares outwards and
really lift the eye up rather than
squashing it down okay so Samuel thinks
we need to use a big lash today which
I'm totally down for I mean I love my
Mami's but sometimes you just gotta be a
little bit extra you know so I grab
these three row ones I think they're
really gonna do the job
okay so just put on some glue and now
Sam said we put them on we need to make
sure that the lashes really go upwards
so they don't close down the eye so I'm
gonna put this right here in the inner
corner perfect and then I was gonna pull
this tail end right up here oh yeah
finnaly really lifted everything
straight up Wow okay so those are
looking up great but I think they could
be a little bit more lifted so you know
what
really get him up there let them up gals
hmm this looks amazing
RFA so this look is almost complete and
our next type is going to be the Liberty
doodahs you know starting from day one
I've learned so many techniques about
over lining and making them look
beautiful of course I've gotten lip
filler but you know what there's always
ways that I can really improve my
technique so this comment comes from
Jessica and she says sister love you but
your over line your lips way too much
you look like they're about to explode
you know what fair noted sometimes I
definitely commit that I go a little bit
overboard so let's just bring them back
to their normal size Wow oh my god
Jessica girl you are literally so bright
I am actually gonna call my doctor right
now and ask her to dissolve the lip
filler because this just looks the best
hashtag natural beauty is the best
beauty this next one I actually get all
the time it is always a top comment on
my video and you know what I hear you
guys
Takaya says sis then lips try though
Hannah says how you gonna be a guru and
have your lips looking dry as how
sunshine says I feel like his lips are
always so dry the indie said Wow
James's lips are about as dry as his sex
life you got me there you know what you
guys are totally right
nobody likes a crusty lip it is
definitely so so serviced and not the
way to go let's accept eventually Wow
oh my god so much better alright you
guys oh my god I think we're actually
done with this look today and looking in
the mirror this is by far the best I've
ever looked oh my god I am so glad that
I set my ego aside and just really
listened to everybody who knew exactly
what they were talking about because
clearly this is the result
and our last but final step was gonna be
setting in place we can really just keep
this on all day long and think I'll be
have one last comment to really goddess
through the settings pray and that is
from Tegea and she says that wasn't his
friends it was the full-on shower you
need to use way less setting spray oh
okay maybe maybe if I use less it'll
really lock it in all day long
let's try that's it alright you guys
that is only hair for this video today
this is Venice so much fun to film this
look I mean can we talk about it
literally iconic 1 million likes on
Instagram here we come autumn or serious
know obviously this video was satire and
I was just joking around in a play
pull em light-hearted manner but if I
said they hate comets never affected me
I would 100% be lying because if I'm
being honest they do obviously I try my
absolute best to put on a good front for
you guys and ways inspire people and
preach positivity but I'm a normal human
being just like you are I have feelings
and sometimes comments really do hurt
before you write something up please
think is this necessary to say is this
helpful is this constructive because
like my momma said if you don't have
anything nice to say don't say anything
at all on the contrary at the end of the
day nobody's perfect especially not me

better person and a better content
creator so if you're saying you want to
say it leave a comment down below
