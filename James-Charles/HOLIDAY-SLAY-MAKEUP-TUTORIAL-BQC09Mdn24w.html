welcome back to my youtube channel so it
is officially fall season it is the end
of November and you know what that means
it's Thanksgiving I personally love
Thanksgiving it is one of my all-time
favorite holidays I have not been home
in over six months now since my senior
graduation so I am literally so pumped
for once to hop on a plane and fly all
the way back home to regular old open in
New York and see my family I literally
missed them so so much I cannot wait to
give momma Charles and sister Ian and
daddy Charles a oh whoa no oooh and
father Charles that was almost really
really bad I'm associated to get them
all really really big hugs the point of
Thanksgiving is obviously to spend time
with your family and friends and be
thankful and of course eat a lot of
really really great food I've been
getting so many treats from you guys
telling me that you guys are going to
different family Thanksgiving parties
with a bunch of relatives that you have
not seen in so so long so for today's
look I put together this funky little
cut crease moment perfect for the
Thanksgiving feast and it's like the
smokey winged out bronzy little fall
moment we have bronze glitter on the lid
and some very very intense fluffy lashes
I just wanted to go very very Akshar
today so everybody at the dinner table
knows I am that bitch we're really going
for the grandma Charles to be like Oh
sister you look so good why don't you
get in line for the Thanksgiving feast
first and I'll be like oh don't mind if
I do all that being said if you guys
like to see how I created this final
little Thanksgiving makeup tutorial keep
on watching all right guys let's go
ahead and jump right and this eye look
is simply gonna be pretty complicated
and definitely a lot going on today just
like our Thanksgiving dinner plates we
got the stuffing at the mashed potatoes
the gravy the turkey and the whole
shebang so I'm gonna be using the brand
new Morpheus 39 I dare to create palette
I absolutely love this palette I can't
with the Holiday Collection that I
modeled for if you guys have not yet
seen my full-on review definitely click
somewhere up here I think if this is the
right side fingers crossed to check that
video out I first got my m4 for one
brush and dip into this middle
transition shade I actually lost a
little sheet with the names on it so
you're just gonna have to bear with me
today I'm just popping the shade right
up in the crease and blending it out
using windshield wiper motions and I'm
actually not topping off the brush
before I find this color we definitely
want this to be a very very vibrant and
pigmented and when we get to the outer
corner I am doing my all-time
favorite trick of pulling that shadow
out a little bit for the next color
we're gonna grab at our 39 brush and dip
into this burnt orange shade right up in
here I'm topping the shade right up in
the crease and normally what I would do
crease shade I would always hold the
brush like this completely parallel or
horizontal there we go to my face but
for this I'm actually kind of holding
the brush downwards to really get it up
in that crease and make sure it doesn't
blend any higher we are gonna be cutting
out the crease today so it's okay for
everything gets on the lid because we're
gonna clean it up later and then same
thing with that outer corner I'm gonna
pull it out and like a nice little cut
v-shape we are gonna be going from
really really light orange obviously in
our transition to really really deep
black in the crease area which you'll
see in a few seconds but I am gonna be
blending in between every snap to make
sure that none of the colors get muddied
it together I'm Mexican I grab another
clean r39 brush this brush is basically
the exact same as the m4 3:3 so if you
have that one
feel free to dip into that one too or
literally any blending brush it's really
not that deep to this and burnt darker
orange shade right up in here but we are
just gonna want make sure every color we
go and we're using a smaller brush or
just a more defined motion to really
make sure that those colors are getting
more and more dark and defined with each
time and once again not getting to money
on next thing I got was smaller more
defined brush this is the M 507 and I'm
gonna dip into this like ready tone
brown shade up in here and I'm gonna use
this to deepen up once again the crease
and the outer V as you guys can see when
doing these style of looks it's really
really important to start off light and
build your way up darker and darker
using a smaller and smaller brush and
smaller motions each time because if you
start off with a dark color and just go
right in everything it's gonna look
really really wonky and unblended like
really really quickly so I know it may
seem like a lot of extremist I mean
we've already literally use for eye
shadow colors and this doesn't even look
like much it yet but if you just take
your time and be patient this is really
gonna like help you with your makeup in
general just starting off really really
slow and having patience will help you
make those iconic beautiful blended out
smokey eyes so this is where things are
going to start to get more complicated
more dark and more intense I'm gonna
grab my m14 9 brush which is this very
very tiny pencil brush and dip into the
black shade in the bottom corner and
uses to deepen Allen crease
or the outer V not the crease oh my god
I just brought my mirror a little bit
closer obviously you guys know my
eyesight is not the best
I really want to make sure that this is
very very defined and precise cuz you
guys know adding a little bit too much
block and make an eye look go from real
good to real bad real fast so excuse the
mirror in the video I'm gonna move it in
a second so with the block on the pencil
brush I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna
top it right into the outer of V we're
gonna coat this entire area out using a
shimmer shadow in a second but I do want
to get all the color on there in the
right shape just like that so we can
blend it out at how the pigment still be
there because like I said we don't want
to add too much block but where there is
the block we want it to be black if that
makes sense to blend that black out I'm
gonna grab Miami five up seven brush
once again and dip into this cool tone a
brown shade up in here and just lightly
go over those edges like I was saying
adding a little bit of black and quickly
get too intense and I think this
definitely just did so I'm gonna go to
my r39 brush and dip into that light
orange shade from before and just go
over those edges to hopefully make
everything a little bit less dark
alright so that is the lid all complete
like I said it did get a little bit
darker than I originally wanted it to
but oh well I guess that's just what
we're gonna have to deal with today now
we're gonna go ahead and cut out the
crease I'm gonna grab my morphe cream
shadow in the shade copper today which
is this beautiful orange shade as the
base of course and then my makeup shock
t57 brush it is just as tiny really flat
to finer brush we are gonna be doing a
lot more of like a detailed crease today
then the classic average half cut crease
where you just kind of blur out the
edges so I do want to make sure it's
really really light and defined I know
some people really like to do a
concealer first when they're cutting out
creases but if you're using a pigmented
cream shadow I feel like it's really not
that deep because you're just gonna
cover over top of it anyway and it does
the same job so like why do you more
work if you don't have to you feel once
again talk about the mir but I'm gonna
lean in close to really make sure I get
this exactly where I want it I'm just
going to carve out this crease I'm just
wanting to send like normal but then
once I get to the outer corner instead
of just fading out the edges I'm
actually gonna pull this shout out once
again when that defined brush and I'm
gonna make kind of a loop back around to
the lower lash line this more rounded
define cut crease is a look that I've
been seeing a ton of people rock on
Instagram lately but I've never actually
tried so I just wanted to test that out
today and honestly I think it looks so
stunning and really really cool and
definitely adds a more like avant-garde
twist
to the draw regular half cut crease just
for an extra little pop on top I'm gonna
grab this Stila liquid metals and the
shade of bronze bell and just Pat a
little bit of this over top of that more
peak cream eyeshadow I really want to
make sure this is dried down before I go
in with any more shadow or anything else
obviously we don't want any of that
shadow to transfer so the last and final
step of my upper lash line today is
actually gonna be to grab the Kat Von D
tattoo liner and the shade of trooper
and I'm gonna really lightly outline at
that outer curve for lashes today I'm
gonna pop on a pair of how's the lashes
ikonics
then I'm just gonna blend together my
real lashes with the fake ones of course
using my benefit roller lash mascara
once the lashes are blended together I'm
gonna grab a black liner pencil and you
guys know I hate doing this but for
today's look I feel like it is necessary
I really want this to be very very sexy
and sultry
I want everybody other things doing
dinner table to know that I am that
bitch that gets the turkey first I
really want to be nice and intense oh it
has been a long time since I've done
that whoa for the lower last I'm gonna
grab into our thirty nine brush and dip
into the bright orange shade and just
run that all around the lower lash and
then of course I can sort of connect it
at that outer corner I'm gonna take my
Beauty Blender I dip into a little bit
of my chances that setting powder and
I'm going to bake right underneath that
shadow because I think it's getting a
little bit too low there and like I said
we do want to keep this very very
defined just like that I'm just gonna
grab any flat top brush and I'm gonna
dip into the already brown shade and I'm
gonna run that along at the lower left
Wow finally I'm just gonna grab a flat
top rounded brush and use this to
highlight my brow bone using of course
what other than my Anasazi illuminator
and so Hollywood then same thing on a
pencil brush in that inner corner all
right guys Metis one eye all complete
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other one
off-camera quickly and I'll be right
back to finish off the rest of the lock
alright guys and those are both eyes all
complete I actually ended up taking off
the electronics and switching them out
for the Lily lashes in the sale Sydney
these are much more intense and
voluminous not gonna lie my eyes are a
little bit on code right now you guys
know I always do have to cut off a lot
of lash to make them work my eyes are
very very tiny but I feel like the
dramatic Ness and the size of these just
really fits in this look so sister it's
gonna suck it up I already added a
little bit of highlighter earlier but I
feel like we are definitely not blending
and now
I mean I'm trying to be on the level of
like aunt Josephine is grabbing for the
stuffing and we're like damn and she is
literally so shocked that she forgets
about what she was doing and then we get
to snatch it up first I'm gonna go in
and lightly spritz my face using the
tatcha dewy skin mist just to give the
highlight or something to stick to and
then I'm gonna grab of course you've got
Stan my Anasazi a so Hollywood
illuminator Oh aunt Josephine is
literally shaking she just fell over
alright guys and to finish off this look
today I'm gonna go into the Anasazi
liquid lipstick in the shade its sepia
I'm not used to slope color and so long
but I felt like you would pair perfectly
with this look I used it a few days ago
for a chocolate and I literally fell
back in love with it it is the kind of a
brownie mouth tone but it definitely
does have some purpley undertones which
matched perfectly with the Reds in the
eye look today and I just like it pairs
perfectly for this fall look and finally
to finish this off I'm just gonna give
my face a good spritz using the
Scandinavian makeup finishing spray
alright guys and this is this little fun
at Thanksgiving cut crease look all
complete it has been a very long time
since I've done a tutorial so I really
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
