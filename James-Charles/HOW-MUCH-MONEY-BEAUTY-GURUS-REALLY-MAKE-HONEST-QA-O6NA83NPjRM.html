back to my youtube channel so it has
been a hot woman when I wouldn't on my
youtube channel I am so sorry if you
guys can follow me on Instagram and
snapchat you would know that I just
actually finally after a million years
graduated once and for all I did
technically graduate early a few months
back but I just went home back to New
York for the first time into four or
five months that's actually moving to
California and I walk to the best my
class for my graduation and it was kind
of iconic normally what I know I'm going
to travel I agree some buildings for you
guys but this time I had a lot of really
exciting meetings and stuff going on
beforehand for products that will be
coming out soon so I didn't get a chance
to pre film but I promise when you find
out what I've been doing on the DL it'll
be worth it well it was an amazing trip
I was definitely ready for it to be over
with
by the end of it and I definitely missed
it being on my LA grind working every
single day so I'm finally back home and
I decided to sit up and film a video for
you guys today I tweeted asking you guys
what you wanted to see because I wasn't
really feeling any makeup inspiration at
the current moment and so many of you
guys had to do a a Q&amp;amp;A now you guys know
I'm pretty much an open book
I am so open and honest with everything
that goes on in my life y'all basically
know every single aspect of it
especially if you are loyal snap fan
follower so kind of let's do something a
little bit different so for today's Q&amp;amp;A
I thought I would do a Q&amp;amp;A based on what
it's like being a social-media
influencer and questions that nobody
really wants to answer I tweeted asking
you guys to send me harsh honest and
hard questions to answer and I actually
got so many cool ones so I'm super
excited for this everybody talk about
everything from how much money I make
joy like meeting fans weirdest
experiences and everything kind of the
sign of what it's like to be a
social-media influencer so if you want
to hear what I have to say on this and
answer some really really honest
question make sure you keep on watching
lazy ass are most beauty gurus slash
social media influencers a lot different
in real life that they present
themselves on camera okay so yes and no
for the most part beauty gurus everybody
is like the exact same as they are on
camera in real life if anything we just
make a lot more jokes and can be a lot
more ourselves because we kind of
understand what goes on within the
actual industry but for other social
media areas of like the spectrum and
different careers stuff I wouldn't say
more no I've met a lot of people that
are in the beauty industries that
so completely different of the on camera
and relay but never in like a way that I
bet it disappointed or upset it's just
mostly in the way to like protect their
image and to like keep their audience
satisfied if that makes sense
let me ask are you ever cautious about
starting yourself with people from the
industry like seeing the be flashed on
with 24/7 online it doesn't make you
garden
abso-fucking-lutely they're like maybe
three people total this industry that I
actually trust I have a lot of super
super close friends but it's so sad to
say that you can never really really
trust anybody so I am super careful of
who I really trust and talk to I think
finding that group of people that you
can really really trust is super super
important in this industry as many of
you guys know watching from an outside
perspective this industry is crazy and
has so much horrifying drama so it's
really really important to find a group
of people that you know you can love and
trust and always look to when times get
tough because trust me and they do make
an ass when people are sponsored and
they say it's their honest opinion of
the product is it actually so obviously
it's going to depend on the person
you're watching I can only speak for
myself here but in my case yes it is
always honest if you guys look through
my email and saw the amount of money and
offers as given on a daily basis you
would probably be freaking shook to the
core so many brands reach out to social
media influencers about campaigns but I
reject actually like 90% of them and
very very blessed and thankful to have
you guys and have a lot of different
sources of income from all across nine
platforms so for me and many other
influencers brand deals are not saying
that it's like super vital to me to be
waiting for the next paycheck
however the ones that I do do are the
ones that I actually really do care
about so if I do like the product I will
definitely do the brand deal take the
money for and give an open and honest
review so if somebody is reviewing a
product is usually because they
generally do like it I definitely can
get twisted sometimes between some
people but like I said I can only really
speak for myself here so if you guys are
saying your view product and say that I
like it and if I'm being paid obviously
I do like it because I like it what data
has dating changed a lot for you since
you've gotten so big and Devoy show you
differently you guys know that boys and
dating at general has never really been
a strong suited line or like a talent
I'm pretty bad at it so it hasn't really
changed in the fact that I'm still
single as fuck however I have noticed a
lot more guys I'm a social tie me which
is so sad and so
grows to even think about but I just
learned to be really really careful with
who I trust and try to date guys that
are like on the same type of like social
spectrum with me I know that sounds so
fuckin shitty to say but you have to
think of it from my perspective
it's really scary to like really trust
somebody and let somebody in if they
have a lower amount of followers because
you really don't know what their true
intentions are so it's much easier to
talk to people that are on like the same
wavelength or at least like in the
social media realm I really hope that
doesn't come across really pretentious
and shitty all our ideas that he means
nothing to me and my future husband
might have zero followers who friggin
cares I'm just saying from a trust and
sweet it's a lot easier to talk to and
trust people that have a little bit more
of a social following just so you are a
little bit more sure that there's
something going on on the DL my ass what
is it like to go from nobody caring
about your mistakes to everyone pointed
it out and criticizing you if you guys
been following me for a while especially
on Twitter you know that I've definitely
I've gotten myself in a lot of a pretty
pretty awful and offensive scandal to
answer your question it's halfway really
fucking annoying but to also I'm very
very thankful for and let me tell you
why the part that I absolutely hate is
really really old content a lot of the
scandals that I've got involved in
people love to frickin dig up the past
and old tweets and old stuff and just
use them against me now for me
personally the tweets that were pulled
up were from a 2013 they were gross and
they were really really offensive and I
have since apologised for them I am not
making any exclusives for them because
they should not happen sent or I came
out of my mouth and I definitely should
have known better however that being
said there was literally no human being
in the entire world that is the same
person they were five years ago or the
same person that they were when they
were 13 years old five years ago I was
just an average everyday middle schooler
was like $100 on Twitter they were all
from my school I didn't know what would
like to have a social following I didn't
have anybody watching me I didn't have
anybody looking up to me so it was a
very very different world I said a lot
of really really gross things that I
shouldn't have said and also a lot of
things that I didn't really understand
the true impact or underlying meaning up
and that's just because I didn't grow up
with a lot of diversity around me but
now I know that those things are shitty
and wrong which is what I have applauded
as a live addressing them but it
definitely does not to have those things
keep getting pulled up constantly when
you've already tried to move on educate
yourself and just be a better person in
I definitely will always like reread in
my tweets and snapshots of WIPO silence
because I have so many of you guys
watching me and looking up to me which
is a really really huge weight on my
shoulders but it's something that I'm so
thankful for and I am so proud of to be
leading such an amazing community I
would never wanted to grade it
disappoint or offend anybody on purpose
I look so thankful that I now have you
guys to call me out when I fuck up so I
can further educate myself and just be a
better person in general Christian asked
if all of your followers disappeared
overnight and you lost all your
influence would you still continue to do
what you love without a platform I
definitely think so yes but maybe not as
frequently as you guys been following me
for a while and Instagram you know that
I kind of started doing a lot of more
creative and avant-garde I'll look and
that's really where my heart lies I
talked about this before on my channel
but I really don't like doing glam that
much and I usually only do actual like
glam when it comes to events and filming
YouTube videos just because that's what
really performs well and that's what
looks pretty for like photos and red
carpet and stuff so I probably wouldn't
do it as frequently and I probably only
be doing makeup when it came to like the
creative artsy a crazy type look but I
definitely still be doing makeup for
sure because I love it and this is like
my hobby and well now my job but it
wasn't my job I would still love it if
that make sense
Jayla ask how much money do you get for
brand sponsorship now this is the
question that nobody ever answers but I
know everybody wants to know but I'll
tell you why they don't answer it that's
because it's actually illegal when we do
branded or sponsorship videos we always
have to sign contracts that they were
not going to discuss how much money
we're being paid or what's going on
behind the scenes aside from the actual
content that you guys are seeing on our
Instagram pages now I've ever done
campaigns and projects in firms that I
absolutely cannot discuss the financials
of it is illegal I'm not gonna concede
in any way shape or form but I will tell
you without giving any further detail
that the most I've ever been paid when
it came to a sponsored YouTube video
within the six-figure eight digit leo
asked how much money have companies
offered you to pull out that when your
social media at the end of the day your
garage trust is a lot more important to
me than any amount of money I will say
that I have declined several over
$1,000,000 offers because it was
something that would fit my brand some
ass be real how many of the people use
collaborative you actually friends with
Bosch come true with outside of videos
every single one of them Ryan asked how
many times have you cried because of
hate
zero Niki ass do you actually like to
meet your fans or does it get annoying
sometime if you guys have any person you
know that I frickin love with you guys
so so so so so so so much it just makes
me so happy to be able to put a name to
the face of all the people that have
been supporting me since day one and it
truly does warm my heart and make my day
I love my new you guys I love taking
pictures but I will say that the 1% of
the time I fucking hate it is when I'm
eating nothing bothers me more than when
I'm about to stick my fork into like a
nice juicy steak or eat some delicious
french fries and ketchup and my coke
then when I see somebody from the other
side of the restaurant trying to take a
slight picture like this because if I'm
not going to see it that really really
bothers me I just feel like giving it's
like a time of having a good time with
your friends and family and just like
it's just very very distractible in
general so if you see me in public
please ask me to take a picture
I would love to freakin meet you I will
give you the biggest hug people take an
amazing selfie just please if I'm eating
wait until I'm done a lot of commotion
for today Caleb asks do you love your
job to end this video on a positive note
ask the fucking movie I am so thankful
to be living my dreams and living this
amazing life at only 18 years old so
many people can't even say when they're
older that they do their retrieve job
and Here I am being very very young
freshly out of high school and having an
amazing time and having all of you guys
watch and support me it really does mean
so much to all you guys are there on the
other side of the camera and even though
there are hard days I wouldn't trade
this for the world
if you eventually be a loyal Beauty
community band you know there's a lot of
a really shitty and annoying and awful
stuff that goes down in industry it
definitely is a very very custom and
hard place to survive but I would not
still be here if I didn't love what I
did
trust me on that one alright guys that
is all I have for this video today my
phone decides I'm all out of questions
like I said before I am very much open
and honest book being a social-media
influencer deftly has its pros and it's
cons there are some amazing days there
is good pay good friends and cool
opportunities but at the same time
there's a lot of heat and really really
shitty situations that we all get
ourselves into so it's definitely a
crazy world that I live in but I'm very
very thankful to be where I am and
thanks to you guys I really hope you
enjoy this video and you learned a
little bit more about me and my weird
ass job if you did it please don't
