in detail so today I would sit down to
talk about some is that a very very
popular and widely talked off topic
right now the community and just like
community again in general and I'm
editing and retouching photos Republic
Wiley Post helping a big city with a
very very controversial topic on social
media but having a little bit of a new
class we guide almost every single it
was her or celebrity that you sequence
in a hotel has probably paid to MIT I
really people are getting so society
called help or because it's looking
really well in the beginning of time
every I suppose and I guarantee probably
how if you watching a lot basis is all
wonderful as well it's definitely one
like all-time favorite newscast today I
wanted to Tel Aviv I can change the
profits from taking the photo started
posting of Instagram everything in
between performing a lot of Olivia's
Italian from I attended all gaze upon
which is so far as the truth oftentimes
economy on satellite was completely
blocking on the photos on America
unfortunately you can't have that months
now I wish you could but yeah little
can't hide that stuff I just was going
to hide anything in the first place I
only talk about babysitting a little
shopping all the time and sharing them
right having your tour free ready to get
rid of all my head so nothing said
anyone to know I did my selfie from drab
to fab issues keep on watching
alright everything involves to a home
screen of my iPhone 7 plus since racing
all my clothes and your own editing I
use Photoshop a long time ago bonala
keep it so for my college makes a lot
easier Kamala quicker September she hi
going start to fish however that I would
limit in which the audibly snapshot told
ours is really disturbing element well
killer
now I never take actual photos with my
camera i order you not to take my
selfies
the camera on your show goes it goes
near your images and it kind of explodes
I'll just get it
Roosevelt built for everything making
those super super high quality but also
old like self retest if that makes any
sense
well I think the fotomat would just save
it and I'll go through my favorite which
are right up in here and I think the one
I like the best
so for today's video competitive base to
this photo right here in this house this
morning the same also now right now it
is clearly like this is for a possible
is now higher later I'll be including
word on a little bit but this is reading
through stress so this will take it away
from the weather out there in my
apartment and really having this little
place for of the grandeur for the
purposes of this video I think I talk
about what good things when people for
editing and that is how the but they
added my photos and artist I like a look
like a generic catalyzed portfolios so
they don't want to house the best works
top of all of you guys to see what I do
is I photo the only same thing that are
already there you will never ever seen
actually editing on makeup absolutely
editing on any imperfections
so the out status braiding of the eye on
the highlights it was long and just
stuff of that basic nature
basic things that can't be fixed with
makeup that having difficulties or
lighting or pauses surgeries to things
that are kind of out of my control
because I doesn't even anybody wants to
call me off or am lying
I do think a video recordings of this
look and does I look like this is once
again brought from snapchat unfiltered
unedited this is my makeup I look pretty
decent I'm linking a lot today
and yeah you can edit it right over so
yeah I'm going to editing this pictures
today just to enhance it a little bit
but keeping in mind what it actually
looks like this morning which would
you're talking about it was really the
first happen always how this is thank
you
now this happens 400 in the outdoor
which is a lot more than the other house
notice that he was not close or although
and truly really enriched it was please
we're going to hit me up I'm going to
wreck this I'm up here going to open
photo
the photo right here now overall lesson
for the pretty good photos unliving one
is literally they do some retouching and
the first wholesome use is Rishi if you
don't wallow and you'll even have this
little sticky low angle other
than a straight triangle or a very very
high
are you just exposes an angle because it
allows for most of my eyelid space to be
show me I'm a very rounded eyes so I
turn to take time I roll a smaller my
lips a little bit smaller and my jaw is
not be at top it's a my forehead looks
cute felicitations infinitely to be
tossed in this make sure they look and
to it and natural as possible the first
event of the photos I'm going to do it
and I was putting in my drawing super
duper common unfortunately I cannot
afford proper surgery and I also legally
cannot get Papa 13 I have Andres so this
is my first thing that we got up in here
I really like the way that looks just
because who doesn't love a really good
challenge all right I think it is one of
the hottest features on anti or does the
other side I'm not really going to do
anything here just because my jaw is
lined up with the corner out this fall
and if I move around it feels very very
distorted and weird so not having a
comment or anything today you must look
at that as possible believe it or not
but I'm going to do in a river of the
details tool this will basically avocado
chocolate to the photo every job but I
like it really does make such a
difference I wasn't on my Odyssey nylon
occasionally stand out and explode to
invade same thing would be on brow here
usually I'll do a nail file because
they're little bit grown out and I
remember getting more attended to them
on a little bit on the apprentices happy
and and then also McCarty a trick
because it works very very hard for the
people to know that it's there and
that's pretty much all the detailing I'm
going to do I really don't know everyone
although attendance is based on original
and once you save it whatever like I
said doing before after that lose I'm
not much but I do believe just a little
things
great intact but I saw videos equations
approved - and this is one that you'll
need to be careful because it truly how
to make a register for a lot of times
are smoother is trouble is I think was
absolutely awful
and so basically and it's obviously not
actually people didn't edit it if that
was not a look I often kind of literally
never seen futher I wasn't through this
and just build up the opacity I really
need to sew it like Moses tool the
preservative level and the knowledge
explore any course for the most exciting
of our hammock prettiest in base I was
going to lightly cavalry reinventing
textured who's kind of like imaging the
brown on the mills region and then this
smile and I could get right here an
island just let us have my beard area as
well because I did chase today because I
believe me and yeah to the table small
talk what I'm realizing all the worth of
it
I hate the way that was have a lot of
texture in life they are very very lucky
I don't know why I really do every good
treatment on the planet and performing
in children something about the exact
URL might block but it would include
about the only more obnoxious look as
well I listed over lighter lipstick and
with a little bigger I want them to look
as real as possible
nothing on the food I'm going with my
all-time favorites to another time this
was like hidden secret not all you know
how to use it I can forget a queen of
code I love it truly technique carefully
so pretty much team to correctly answer
very so the first thing that you're also
a little fish of the highest are very
very power and I repent in front of a a
very very large window hitting on
facility could see multiple highway
system you might military very bright
but there's nobody hitting of a size my
face or dollar is because I hold the
soldiers so on the schedule
home to Germany publish all kinds of
even ends like over by the Taliban
accidentally the clothes already
pre-selected and it's been a great
opportunity with the top I really know
almost well not quite
I wanna shortstop certified orthotist of
mainly state and to light it doesn't
look right easily for the kids clothes
without telling someone to write on it
and suffering like having a little bit
automated no I'm all the windows on
women who aren't right over here if I do
this a little Michael interspecies be
but I literally just lightly tap on my
fault I never look at it and scrub it I
just it'll look really stupid like this
which obviously not on what we're going
for and was extremely wrong focus of
every race women record ah well yeah
this is really just lightly tap it in
just like I'm getting every room light
and even of that and then I think it's
too intense event really how that looks
understand about a race in this weather
accounted for it and it's a family felt
pretty bad people in America but I ran a
little highway under the Chico region
now if you look right here you can see
where the texture is all natural high
leader now the way to companies from the
society so much straight on if you have
another variable face but how is not
plastic I'm going to when we tell us a
little bit highly right here to in
church I would others and I look awful
that's going to talk over along together
to title on banana me to look natural
and there's also a little bit better
than low about I certainly to let it
there but certainly not one with no one
is but that is paying okay
now the neck another chemical is the eye
and this playing back a lot of talk
about being either love it or hate it
I absolutely will let you guys I can do
it and this trip and I absolutely look
and I was writing out behind I'm going
to our faculty telling the disciples
critical Holly to start white always in
the corner
I know if your body's entire you can
smell you would use your way so that's
gonna grab another one of all the
telephones a zoom all the way in
prefer what we have anonymity I consider
willingly right and then comes the
actual pupils is my all-time favorite
trick I'm going to a we have in the
White House in people of the eye and
this is breakfast and they can look so
forget pretty I'm not feeling but I love
the people so this doll line was almost
a part to Turkey but a Bookman if it
actually be natural
we why I forget it must i mostly my eyes
are brown if I always wear on the
components anyway there do in the color
of creamy base there like open doors
they are so frickin beautiful and they
do look good like a lecture on the slash
lot with a couple of photography it's a
little hard to see when you link a
leaflet last days because we create shot
photo I just add a little bit more
brightness on the iPhone another top so
shine a little bit of a beat and I
Whitney should leave the top part of the
vanilla given in the shadow of sniffing
both newly baked so that I might light
legalizing the race she should look
beneath that is taken again very well
the last and final episode of our seats
work on the nova cobbler now 30 minutes
are many customers in the past and
always feel ego to blow my nose contour
hey my nose contour I really love it not
know like I said before I am NOT some
kind of a very open underneath and my
nose will be moment anything on I on a
channel many times though I know
probably talents on the hood
show them with a mouse and memories of
that time learning and as you can see in
the phone probably not back that it does
look pretty stuck we get away with
ignorant self I do really trust look
when I thought I was closest bus I want
to head of this make it look even better
because why Donna to do this I'm going
to take this home to I'm going around
the Taylor school and I think that his
immense she was in she come around the
light
right up in here I'm going to lightly
talking about color
no not going to reach the saddle I was a
lot of fun when you do this it keeps the
cycles in the texture they're
entertaining the under color another
sure how it works but it really terms of
wonders why I absolutely love with
checking in with my speakers today in
the online fast fast notes and every
both have to be before after all the
signature James Charles knows not as if
I want be most interesting about me but
I'm not gonna hide it I were very very
noticing Bob secret I do believe women
look so hot oh my little something those
sure about how I decided it but either
way I know they just don't do it
actually I went through this is certain
techniques that I like to do and
especially those in the salsa music so
notice the notice does this is my basic
recently edit as you can see actually
not that different
the pictures look pretty similar I
didn't a little charm a little player
runs long see her but there's only like
two are basically go on the head in the
book but he wants to be the police out
here I reason we're going to do some
balance was busy just filtering and
color stuff so this order to become she
does need to focus
Idaho zombie Twitter something but
Instagram B doesn't have a very cohesive
beat I'm going to whiten the photo and
color to color a little bit lacking that
are do not basis is going to is the
waiting to over here and this is the one
step where I want my advice to reviews
your bigger angle ham with its croelick
area slowing the toilet if you
absolutely have to choice will be
apparently to combine identity how we
erase foetus will work and if I can do
it make sure everything is really clean
after the ball part I think we are
subluxation sort of thing wanted to test
out favorite things to channel and there
we were all sets a new model with the
next step so based on the next stop that
I will refuse disposition can now really
filters without resembling for you our
first evil
binoculars and I kind of the colors a
little bit so I'm a city of those
looking for that I'm not having no
constant rustling on corner this by
integrating over shouldn't this tool
later which is called skin up I
participate when I was either too yellow
for two days in photos it will like
biggest happy or you don't know why I
was looking a neutral and palpable and
this will be looking way too yellow sort
of the ticket 500 I guess now how to
around out early three points I love my
unusual another show how was going to
read on the actual video to quality
month my phone this is looking very
neutral very very like rainbows engine
you'll listen to anything that wait
there for some reason this your apology
envoys will notice if I hate when I skin
tones the battle to say go home Owen
picture so this is what others have to
leave by little and often not only other
names of the basin and this okay my
business is appropriate start but now
that was another history of injuries to
out who's obviously open accounts go to
photos with adjustments to home to be
nice Alex reader bracelets way out so
hard even to wrong seventh the conical
booth is well Callie long time ago
wolf Airways right why is that remember
I really like the look of cool tone
photos I usually work them to run 15 for
15 years whether conduct area and always
infatuation house as well because
sometimes are one family don't have full
ownership of my review still there it is
a small school the deck mounting source
is called out and like I said I've been
doing a really cool town post at
McDonald's go over to it be blue and
then bring this out to probably Robin
mmm
15% while I was a highly sensitive
the location of talent and our little
image I was down to a little more
context and I lasted about the sister
shot in the photo
this is like the one thing I love to do
and sometimes music not selfies like I
said it need to call you super super
good super smooth but if I can do a
little bit of detail internet for Little
Shop of the crap and pictures through
some of the other says around coming
around one-30 just music and Madison we
dissolve event I will connect whatever
cash you want and then click Share other
way and not secluded face in tutorial to
turn over all but mostly went from this
to this Frances before I do consider
myself an artist and for me if I
histogram was like my portfolio if I
like to find out the best quality little
as possible and that definitely includes
anime Oh everything a photo post of an
influencer always celebrity has been
edited and that's just the cold hard
truth it's something to be embarrassed
on this happened to call people how poor
and it's not going to yell either for
the most of us it's just to fix
imperfections but obviously people do go
crazy but if that heard of just all of
us are the people who go and do the
moment usually something said I can hope
