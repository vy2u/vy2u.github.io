back IG Channel oh my god it feels
literally so good to be sitting here and
filming it in front of this camera right
now I know you guys have obviously been
seeing videos for me all the time but
they were actually all pre filmed
because I've been to traveling and just
working on a lot of super awesome and
secret things the past few days which
has been so so so exciting you guys are
literally not ready for the things that
are about to come with The Sisterhood
but regardless in case you cannot hear I
am very sister sick right now I just
traveled to a Vegas in Salt Lake City
this past weekend of a good friend at
lips like Nick for her makeup tour but I
got very very sick which is so
inconvenient and so rude and so
homophobic but I've been downing mucinex
and don't stop and awesome and blowing
my nose every 15 seconds Thank You
Kleenex hashtag not sponsored but
hopefully we'll be gone soon
and if you already hated my voice get
ready for this video because this is
about to be intense since I literally
have not had makeup on in over a week
now and knowing that blowing my nose
would take off my nose contour in about
three seconds flat
I really just want to sit down today I
play with a little bit of makeup I have
a really pretty look in mind inspired by
a bum of a Mitchell I saw The Times
Instagram page and I was like wow any
this on my face right now so we're just
gonna chill I want to do a little bit of
a sister Q&amp;amp;A as well because I haven't
done one in a while and for videos that
I'm doing these more colorful creative
looks doing a juicy Q&amp;amp;A during that was
literally the only way that I can
guarantee it'll still get views and you
guys will still watch so love being a
bargaining Queen let's jump into the
video all right guys just something
right and this question is actually a
really good one to start off with that
I'm really gonna think about here but
this is from a sister owed Ron and he
said if you couldn't be convicted of any
one type of crime what criminal charge
would you want to be immune to that is
such a good question if I could be
immune to any criminal
oh my god 100% hello Rob the u.s.
national bank right now take all the
money and run and nobody ever knows are
you kidding I finally be able to buy my
sister house without having to worry
about three lines of credit 100% that's
actually such a crazy cool person though
I've never even thought about I want you
guys to all answer that in the comments
down below to actually maybe not I could
get bad real fast
never mind dog dude
I think you're a great hair you're
kidding what is this I do what this is a
joke I have a great hair at age 18 oh my
god wait Kelly give me a zoomin that's a
gray hair I quit
oh my god I'm scared you call Hayes what
the hell that just ruin my day and my
life probably oh my god
sister Nika ass what's one thing wrongly
did in your makeup routine before you're
a professional makeup artist that you
would say to your younger self right now
when you have all this knowledge oh my
god 100 percent will be stop using so
much powder while baking your face
clearly you guys know flash like Mary
happened for a reason and it's because I
used to use literally so much baking
powder it's absolutely insane like I
used to pack it on with a powder puff
not even a beauty blender and it looked
so bad and not only did I look very very
textured but it also created one of my
biggest scandals of all time which thank
God I was able to turn it into a meme
and make it productive for me but oh my
god it was really really embarrassing in
the moment I feel like a lot of people
who watch beauty gurus for makeup
education including myself this is
totally how I learned how to do makeup
in the first place tend to follow
exactly what a lot of us do and
implement those steps into like their
everyday makeup routines literally once
again that's how you learn to do makeup
in the first place obviously you should
support and watch whatever you want and
whoever you find entertaining duh but
when it comes to actually listening to
the tips and advice and implement take
different products and techniques into
your routine I would say that it's
really really important to find a guru
or one or two who have very very similar
features and skin types to because
people like Patrick Starr for example
who use a million pounds of pressed
powder may sit there and say yes baked
your face bake your face bake your face
but for those people who want a really
really dry skin if you do that you will
look like the Sahara frickin desert and
then on the flip side there's a lot of
gurus out there such as icarly by Bell
or Jocelyn Hill who have more normal to
dry skin and they don't really set their
face much at all except for underneath
their eyes and for people who have oily
skin if you did that your face would be
melting off at about thirty seconds flat
after walking outside with no pressed
powder on so it's really a matter of
finding different people that you not
only like and find entertaining to watch
but also are able to give you accurate
techniques that are going to work for
you I definitely say for me I wish I
took my skin type into consideration
more when learning how to kind of set my
face in place we would have avoided
flashdrive Mary but
hey at least we got a really iconic meme
out of it mariah asked how did you grow
so fast in the beauty industry
what's your secret slash math that you
use to get noticed / stay notice this is
actually a really good question that I
get asked all the time I've kind of
briefly touched on this in a few
different videos but you guys know I
love giving business advice and it's
like my favorite thing in the entire
world so I thought I would answer this
one today I think the reason that I did
grow so fast in the beauty industry it's
because of looks that I started off
doing and I don't want to talk about me
being creative because I literally feel
like I talked about that in every video
at this point I think that originality
is really what grooming it to begin with
and is what's kept me relevant up until
this day I'm definitely someone who can
take pride in the fact that I do create
a lot of really really original concepts
for my channel that I've been started a
lot of other people and a lot of other
creators as well and I just work really
hard to come up with new concepts all
the time I'd like to make up industry
its kind of hit a wall in the sense that
we've literally all seen everything done
like a million times are like every
single I said about the Cubs I feel like
is looking exactly the same like every
single week there's a new challenge
coming out that feels like one of the
other challenges that we've all seen I
feel like what set me apart from a lot
of different influences that I was doing
something different and that's always
the advice that I give to up-and-coming
artists are people who want to build a
social media page is that you have to do
something different you have to do thing
that's gonna set yourself apart from
everybody else with a little bit of glam
and a little bit of face tune who's
doing the same exact thing because as
blunt as it sounds
nobody's ever gonna make it with some
brown smokey eyes and some nude lips
like it sounds harsh to say that but at
the end of the day there's a million
other people doing it so the only people
who are really succeeding and who are
gaining quickly are the ones who are
really setting themselves apart and
establishing themselves as both an
entertainer and an artist if that makes
sense
I also Khalid - if you go into the
industry trying to grow and trying to
gain followers and that's your reasoning
behind doing the makeup in the first
place you're never gonna make it because
it's gonna be really really obvious and
apparent to the people that are gonna be
following you whereas if you go into it
really focusing on your art and like I
said putting out a new original content
that nobody's seen before
the followers gonna come no matter what
because it's gonna be something
interesting that they're gonna want to
keep watching so I feel like you really
have to go into it with the different
lenses that everybody else and kind of
think like what can I bring to this
industry that doesn't already exist here
and it's gonna be those people who
really think outside of the box and
think strategically that are gonna make
it to the top ass your ass where have
you always wanted to go but never been
able to oh that's actually I'm really
good
there's actually a lot of places that I
really really really want to travel to
um South Africa was actually like my
number one place that I really wanted to
go to and that trip is now checked off
the bucket list which was literally
amazing and also not so amazing at the
same time you guys all know why
Australia summers that I also am so
excited to go to oh my god
literally it one week from today I'll be
in Australia on tour and I've ever been
more excited for anything in my entire
life I am so pumped I've heard it as a
such a beautiful place Australian boys
are all so beautiful so I'm just very
very excited and if you are a sister
down under and you want to come see me
don't forget to check out James Charles
Australian comm for all your tour
information and tickets
I think the sisters VIP packages have
already had completely sold out for both
shows which is so late so thank you guys
for all the support but there are still
the IPS and general admission tickets
available this siren is being so weird I
am just trying to promote my tour as I
was saying before I was rudely
interrupted yes Australians definitely
that's on my bucket list that'll be
checked off very very soon so I'm so
excited for that I want to go to Italy
first I want to go to Paris I want to go
to the UK I want to go to New Zealand I
want to go to South America I really
want to go to Peru I want to go to
Canada I've never been to Canada before
even though it's literally right up
there take my Canadian sisters up north
I would really love to go to Japan
eventually that sounds so much fun hello
I just want to travel and just see all
of my sisters all around the world
sister Priscilla
asked who was the kind best celebrate
you ever met Wow
can't wait to answer this one because I
know it won't get me in twist scandal
but I probably actually have to say Kim
Kardashian hands down she has been
absolutely incredible every single time
that I met her she definitely has a
little bit of a controversial public
figure but she doesn't let that get to
her and she's just really really funny
she's unapologetically herself and she's
a really really smart businesswoman and
she's just really really nice all on top
of that and has always been nothing but
absolutely amazing and I would really
love to work with her one day so I
definitely love it sister Kim handsome
easy answer for that one all right guys
I'm currently baking in the oven I'm
gonna go in and do eyebrows off-camera
sorry I literally cannot talk while
doing them I need to focus so hardcore
texture that eyebrows end up being
sisters and not like distant cousins
twice removed because
it happens let's be real so I'll be
right back in a few minutes to start off
the eyes so starting on behinds today
like I said I'm doing a look inspired by
a moment Mitchell when my all-time
favorite artist and he's a UK artist and
UK artist use a lot of very different
techniques than us American and us
artists and their eye shadow always
looks away a bomber than ours so I
definitely want to try a lot of the
different techniques today so I'm gonna
start off with the P Louise eyeshadow
base this is a kind of similar textures
like the mac prolongwear concealer and
I'm just going to Pat this on using a a
flat concealer brush and then for my eye
shadow today I'm gonna be using the P
Louise I shut up palette apparently
instead of really blending this in
you're supposed to kind of a tap it in
to place and what really is scaring and
worrying me about this is that none of
the UK artists ever set their base they
go right in with the shadows of right on
top and kind of blend it even though
it's still wet so I want to try to do
that today I'm not sure how to nor turn
out but clearly they're doing something
right they're putting something in the
water over there that's always making
the shadow look bomb so you know what
we're gonna take risk so unless I throw
my brush on the ground like I just did
I'm gonna grab my morphe Emma 511 brush
I love this brush that is a really
really big fluffy brush and dip into the
shade P Louise right here in the palette
and I'm going to use this yellow shade
as a transition shade and the outer
portion of the crease this I said look
it's gonna be pretty complicated so I
don't really want to explain what I'm
doing so I'm gonna go back to answering
your guys's questions during the process
and sister Bobbie asked have you ever
unfollowed one of your fan accounts and
why and the answer to that is actually
yes I have one very specific incident in
mind and this was a very very hard
choice for me to make but I did have a
obvious reason for doing so and that
being that this person was being very
very mean to a lot of my other fan
accounts and we actually had an incident
in the sister and a few days ago
regarding a very similar thing actually
but after all the crap that I've been
hit with from BS of stand Twitter and
people online just hating me for no
reason and just being so nasty the
absolute last thing that I want you
sisters to be as mean to anybody even if
somebody's being the worst person in the
world are being rude to you they're
being mean though
to somebody else please I asked you guys
don't address it don't say anything just
be the bigger person and either be nice
about it or just don't say anything at
all if anything you guys know I'm
definitely a firm believer and allowing
people to grow and change from their
mistakes and although the love from you
guys is always a really really intense
and amazing
they hate from the haters is also very
very intense and you guys know that for
sure so if the haters coming into the
sisterhood already having a bad feeling
about us and feeling that we may be
really really dramatic or really really
scandalous or all have god-like kind of
mindset then we all think the same way
prove them wrong let's just all be is so
amazing and so nice to one another that
all the haters come in or like oh oops
these people are actually a really
really dope and James is awesome and all
his fans are really really awesome as
well so like I was saying I haven't
followed a fan account before I'm not
happy about it I it paid me a lot to do
so but at the end of the day this person
was being very very nasty to a lot of my
other friends who I also love and care
deeply about and that is never okay so
be nice
share the love no matter what even if
somebody's not sharing the love back
because I guarantee it'll come back
around to both you and the positively
and them in the negative life Karma's a
bitch sister Zoe asked if you could
bring one thing from your house in New
York and bring it to your apartment in
LA what would it be and why literally
the answer this is so easy my dog Benny
oh my god I miss him so much
it is literally insane and for some
reason too I think there has been a very
very strange influx of dogs in my
apartment building recently it's really
just making me so sad and miss him so
much
and you guys know like I've been trying
to buy a house really badly and it's not
exactly working out but the first thing
that I do when I get a house before I
even like my furniture is literally
getting a dog I cannot wait to adopt one
oh my god I am so beyond excited I need
a dog right now in my life I really want
to get like a husky pitbull mix like
that just sounds the best and the entire
world it's been on my agenda trust me
sisters tannaz if you had a launch your
own makeup line what would be the first
product that you would come out with oh
that is thought eyes so easy
definitely a 100% in eyeshadow palette
you guys know eyeshadow is by far my
favorite part of my makeup routine and
so I really feel like I can be super
super creative and always switch things
up and always push the boundaries I just
live for a good colorful moment
I definitely have if you are really
really or really bomb ideas for palates
they've never been done before either so
you guys will have to stay tuned and see
what happens I'm gonna take this
metallic light blue shade if I'm a 35 B
you guys up this is my all-time favorite
palette from morphe with all the
rainbows she's use go James for 10% off
this palette and all other amazing
morphe goodies and I'm gonna try to pop
this on the lid
maybe and this might give us the similar
look I'm scared
sister Katie asks what is your current
favorite clothing brand oh that's
actually a really really good question
and if you had asked me this literally
like six months ago my answer would have
been literally like per 421 and taught
man which is the most boring generic
white boy answers ever but my answers
have now drastically changed and I'm
actually really happy about it because
you guys know I definitely said I'm
getting this year that I want to take
fashion a way more seriously and really
get into it and just be really proud of
the outfits that I wear because a lot of
times my face is looking a real beat but
I'd wear the same hoodie and every
single picture ever which I'm sure it
got really really boring for you guys
were really really fast so right now I'm
really loving a lot of the different
trends that are going on involving like
modern street wear that's like my
all-time favorite style of fashion I
just feel like it's so it's so so cute
for me too I really love that style
because it's really fun to experiment
with it and it's like a very very kind
of more masculine street wear type of
outfit and then just a B ass face
right on top I said F gender stereotypes
it's very very heterogeneous and it's
just really really cool to like play on
that and I just have really really been
loving it so recently I really been
loving the brand jeah the label they are
I think in Australia Brent and their
products are so done with actually
wearing a shirt for them right now this
is like a really really cute jacket I
love Laura's boutique use co J's for 10%
off that is actually my best friend's
brand but they do have a lot of really
really cute stuff that I've been wearing
a lot recently there's another brand
that I've been wearing a lot recently
called Medi cow they are a German brand
and I actually just found out that
there's literally one girl who runs the
entire thing and the clothes are so cute
she means everything from scratch if you
guys want to go check it out I will
leave her stuff down below she is so
talented
actually maybe don't check her out
because then she won't have time to make
all my clothes but she was really good
she definitely deserves the support I've
also been working with a lot of
different designers out here and I like
to get costume
has made such as oh wow Brian horns the
guy who made all my Coachella looks and
literally slayed them is working out so
many cool things for you right now and I
am just so so so excited my bank account
is not because getting custom fashion is
ridiculously expensive but I'm
definitely a firm believer I'm paying
people for their work especially when
it's custom and really cool stuff like
that and it's just been really fun for
me I really like the world of fashion
it's like something that I've been very
very interested in but I've never been
very good at so I'm definitely really
excited to be working on it a lot more
and just be having really cool outfits
that I'm really confident and feel
really proud of because honestly not
gonna lie it's something that I've
struggled with a lot so it's been a fun
challenge for me and I'm definitely
looking forward to it a lot sister Rae
asked does it annoy you that so many
people on YouTube use sister all the
time now this is Lin that I get asked
all the time and I don't think I've ever
actually addressed it on camera but no
matter what way you really look at it no
I don't mind it at all in fact it
actually you really really love it
obviously started off as like a personal
joke between a me and my close friends
but when it came time to pick a name for
my fandom because I literally hate the
word fan more than anything in the
entire world sisters made sense because
it was already what I call my best
friends and I like to think of you guys
as a far more than fans and kind of like
a close family that we all have together
so it made sense and if people want to
call it their fans sisters - that's
super cute it just means we're all one
big happy YouTube family I think it's
super super fun and then also if you
look at it from the other side as well
it's literally a free promotion which
I'm definitely never gonna straight from
at this point we've kind of reinvented
the word sisters I'm gonna say yet we
reinvented the word sisters and it's how
to become like a meme at this point
which I am so down for now a lot of my
being on social media has literally been
like turning myself into a meme and then
profiting off of the hate so that's
definitely what I'd like to do and
sisters has kind of become one of those
memes at this point and now I'm known
for being high sisters and I live for us
so everybody should say sisters all they
want
I do wanna add a little bit more of a
pop just like how Mitchell did on his
original look with some sister glitters
so I'm gonna mix together a few
different ones it's just a white
translucent one this one is like a blue
a green
reflect steel type of one then I'm gonna
add in a few of these little holographic
star glitters as well right on top of
the land
for a lot of thing I'm gonna use the new
bounds I'm a dragon Lee Lash's
these are definitely much bolder and
bigger than what I usually would wear
for a lily lash Miami but I feel like
these will definitely match the look of
really really well today and they
survived me of the style that all the UK
artists use I have not been more proud
and more excited for an eyeshadow look
in a very very long time
so I'm gonna go ahead and do the other
one on camera quickly and I'll be right
back to finish off the rest of the look
and answer a few more juicy scissor
questions whoo all right sisters we are
back that took me a hot minute to mirror
this I overtook this one but I think we
got them pretty close I am literally in
love with this look and I'm so excited
to finish it I want to take selfies
right now so let's go ahead and move on
and finish up next up is obviously gonna
be the glow but before we do that I
think I want to answer one last question
from you guys so let's go ahead and see
this one is from sister Johan and he
said tells the story of you getting
caught tickling your pickle oh my god do
I want to tell the story right now this
they were before starting the story to
my younger audience out there especially
parents if you're watching with your
children um hi mom and dad by the way
that's awesome that you guys watch with
your kids hello you rock best parents
ever this story is not exactly the most
PG you guys know you have a very very
family-friendly channel I will do my
best to kind of you out certain words
and tell the story in the best way
possible
it does however have a very very
important message behind it so choosing
your own well I'm telling you right now
this may be inappropriate but you
already saw most of the makeup look if
you want to click off because you don't
want to hear this I don't blame you but
let's jump into the story if you've been
a longtime subscriber in mind any watch
a lot of my videos I've alluded to the
fact a few times here and there that I
may or may not have been caught when I
was younger doing my business and if
you've also been a longtime subscriber
you would know that I've never actually
told my coming-out story because I've
said that there was legal problems with
it I didn't know if I could really tell
them without getting in trouble and what
people don't know is that those two
stories are actually the same story
when I was younger I think and around
sixth grade I was 12 years old at the
time I was
hormonal I just gone through puberty and
just like every other boy I was going
through that stage of life clearly at
this point in my own head I had figured
out that okay I was not exactly
interested in the sisters and was
happily done for the brothers so here we
go
you guys know that I've definitely
always been very very active on social
media and at this time period I was
active on tumblr at the time there were
a lot of really really famous bloggers
that I loved and looked up to and one
website that all these famous bloggers
would always go on to meet their fans
was called omegle which is an online
chatroom
I remember gonna make up literally all
the time and sitting there for hours
clicking through different strangers
trying to find out different famous
bloggers that I really really loved and
wanted to meet and just wanted to talk
to you for a few short seconds and
ironically enough I don't think I ever
once met anybody who I was looking for
because there was always a thousands of
thousands and thousands people online
but when they're scrolling through
strangers video cameras on an anonymous
live video cam website I'm sure you can
imagine what I started to come across as
a hormonal twelve-year-old thinking
about this is making me want to die I
quickly realized that although a lot of
people on tumblr we're using the site to
meet their fans and meet new friends
that a lot of people were using omegle
for different purposes and through
realizing this I also started using
omegle for different purposes if you get
what I'm putting on the table here oh my
god so me and sister-in are three years
apart and the way the school system was
divided is we had elementary school
middle school and high school so during
middle school when I was in sixth grade
and this is all going on he was still in
elementary school meeting and every
single day I would have an extra
guarantee one hour from when I got off
the bus at home to when he would get off
the bus at home since he was coming from
a different school once I kind of
figured out the schedule and how to
really finesse the whole situation the
visits to omegle became more and more
frequent until they were literally a
daily occurrence
what's thinking about it now is
literally so repulsive but at the time
I'm not even gonna lie I was definitely
like addicted to it it was a fun
challenge for me which is so like
psychotic to think about but I was 12 I
was very very hormonal I was going
through puberty and that's why I'm
telling this story now because obviously
it's a very very serious and scary thing
that I don't want any of you guys
through so listen up also as well very
very important thing to know I was a
minor at the time I was obviously at 12
years old but I never once ever ever
ever ever ever got naked on camera and
to this day I have still never sent a
Dickey D Piketty that's for personal
reasons but every single time it would
always be a guy who was above age doing
his business and then when he would ask
me to take my clothes I'd be like who my
camera's broken I don't know what's
going on I won't turn on what the heck
this is so where this has never happened
before so I could avoid obviously taking
my clothes off which I did not want to
do and do not want to blind anybody with
and also of course breaking the law so
although this is a horrible idea I did
not break any laws which is great
obviously but once again still please do
not do this literally ever anyways like
I was saying this became a very very
routine I was doing this all the time
and I was getting a very very good at it
until one night that will go down in
history forever
setting the scene it was probably about
9 10 p.m. on a school night one night
Ian was already asleep because he was
much younger than I was and my mom was
already asleep as well because she
always was about very very early for
some reason so the only people awake in
the house for myself and my dad and my
dad always would chill in his living
room watching football or watching the
news
super super late at night every single
night and his living room was right
below my bedroom in our house I remember
very very vividly I was writing an essay
for a history class that I absolutely
hate it and in the middle of it I took a
break to do my business so I went on to
omegle comm started searching through
people eventually found someone and
there we go things got started and all
of a sudden in the middle of my business
tickling the pickle my door slams open
and there's my father in the doorway
looking and very concerned and there is
me standing right in front of my
computer which is in the same line of
view as my door but naked with the
screen lit up right in front of me and
all he said was you need to turn that
off and go to bed right now
so I said got it sir good night love you
the most and I ran my little naked butt
into my bed and
shut my eyes and cried myself to sleep
the next morning I woke up one
downstairs for breakfast took a shower
and nothing happened nothing was
different my dad did not look at me
different my mom did not know what was
going on as if yeah and I was so
confused and also obviously like
literally having a panic attack the
entire day of freaking out wondering
what was gonna go on did he see anything
clearly he saw something of mine but did
he see anything on the computer screen
so I was freaking out all day long said
nothing go to school all day long all
seven periods nothing no texts
nada obviously I know that something
that's going to go down and they're
going to say something but I didn't know
when I didn't know what they were going
to do and I I just didn't know and at
the time I was so freaked out and I was
so nervous that when I got home from
school that day I didn't even go
upstairs I literally Santos's and I
think I was like drawing a picture or
something
you guys don't used to draw all the time
was one of my favorite hobbies that was
one of the only things that I could do
before I really had makeup to kind of
escape and to just really focus on my
creativity and left the outside world go
away because at that moment I just
wanted to disappear into a hole and
never come out
well behold when both my parents get
home they say sister James well I was
just shaved at the time but James we
need to talk please come with us
upstairs and instantly as soon as I
walked upstairs to them and found that
my bed and started talking I realized oh
my god this entire time I've been so
nervous that I have not touched my
computer since last night when I jumped
from my computer chair 70 feet across my
bedroom straight into my bed butt-naked
meaning I did not clear my internet
history so sitting there talking to them
the entire time I was already freaking
out but now I'm really freaking out
because I'm realizing oh my god if my
dad did not see anything now he's really
gonna see something so of course the
first thing that comes out of their belt
is we would love to check your internet
history my heart literally sunk faster
than the Titanic and that walk from my
bed over to the computer
turning on typing in my password going
to Google Chrome opening the internet
history and it being right there right
at the top was probably the hardest 10
seconds of my entire life I can
literally see the disappointment in my
parents face and they clicked on omegle
and there was the flan website and what
made it even worse
that I eliminate
once again on the front pages you could
put an interest of the different topics
that you'd want to talk about so for
example soccer football webkinz Club
Penguin at the time or the names of 12
and 13 year old bloggers that I was
trying to find but now instead right
there on the front page was about a 10
word list consisting of gay bi men boys
and woo there was the closet door was
flung open and outran me unintentionally
I remember Hensley started balling as
any child would because I was obviously
embarrassed that they caught me doing
this but also now because I was out of
the closet and in this current moment I
was not exactly ready to fly myself out
like that but thinking about it now I'm
actually kind of thankful that this did
happen as crazy as that sounds because
the conversation after is probably one
of the coolest conversation I've ever
had at my parents in my entire life I
love them the most we've always been
very very close with this conversation
meant a lot to me because instead of
freaking out about me being gay and my
dad is very very Catholic as well so
that was something that I was super
super scared about the conversation was
very obviously more tailored towards
please don't do this this is so
dangerous there are predators out there
like you are putting yourself at such a
major risk and we don't want to see you
either get in trouble or get hurt and
I'm so thankful for that because from
that day on I never once did it again
and I've always been so careful about
that I've always been a very very huge
advocate for myself and my friends about
online pornography and chat rooms like
that but whoo that moment of my life is
probably one of these scariest things
that I've ever had a deal with it was so
horrifying it was embarrassing it was
sad it was just a lot of emotions going
on at one time and I'm so thankful to my
parents hilda and the way that they did
but yeah that's how I got caught doing
my business on a chatroom with the
camera off thank God and that is also
how I came out of the closet to my
parents I literally cannot believe I
just said this all in a video I had
never told this story publicly ever once
in my entire life but I think that this
does have a very important message
behind it obviously it was very very
embarrassing at the time and thank God
we my family can laugh about it now
several several years later dad I love
you the most
saw you how to see that but I think this
story does have a very very very
important message behind
safety parents and kids if you guys are
still watching this through all of it
congratulations love you the most
please be careful as to what you do
online please do not send risky pictures
to anybody if you have text via snapchat
via any app that is currently popular
right now it is so incredibly dangerous
you never know what they're doing with
that picture that you get screenshot it
they could screen record they could take
a picture even though their phone so
it's on the deal and you would never
ever ever know until it comes back ten
years later as blackmail and it's just
so dangerous and so so so stupid you
never know who's watching you never know
who's recording you never know what
people's true intentions are there are
some really really really crappy people
out there and please learn from your
mistakes it's dangerous and it's very
very embarrassing if you get caught so
don't do that and story time complete
whoo
and last but finally not least after
filming this for four hours and it's
been a long time since I've been this
obsessed with the makeup look on my face
so I definitely need to set it and lock
it in place for the rest of the night so
I'm gonna grab the screen to Navy eye
makeup finishing spray and get myself a
hobby spreads all over to make sure I am
locked in and ready just go you guys all
this is my all-time favorite settings
right and you can use code James for
money off your purchase I think it's
like 25% which is pretty less so go
check it out I'll raise this is that is
definitely enough questions for today
and I think that is the finished look as
well oh my god I absolutely love how
this turned out I feel so beautiful I
love the contest between at the bright
blue and the kind of burnt orange ready
shades the glitter I don't ever wear
glitter I don't ever wear big lashes
