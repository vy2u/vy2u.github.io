welcome back to my youtube channel first
today said I have something super super
pro plan that I'm actually literally so
beyond excited for so this is a trend
started on YouTube I think by a Sofia
Nygaard and not even sure at this point
I feel like she starts a little every
trend we love a YouTube latch and I get
through my makeup all the time I pick up
all my own products I plan my looks and
I'm gonna throw that all the window
today and let you guys pick my makeup
this is kind of gonna be like one of
those choose your adventure games that
we all ride when we were younger you
know the ones where you like died for
steps in every single time but then
you'd always go back and redo it until
you finally won yeah literally me with
everything in life but every single
aspect of my makeup routine today is
gonna be chosen by you guys from the
products to the styles to the colors
literally everything so this could
either go really really well and I could
look the beautiful and fabulous and
stunning at the end or this could be a
major hardcore sister sabotage but that
is all up to you guys without further
ado I'm gonna hop on my Twitter which if
you don't already follow me and it's
just a James Charles go follow me and
it's a pretty lit time turn on post
notifications so you can see all the
scandals before they really begin and
we're gonna be posting all sorts of
polls on there to see what you guys want
me to wear and let's get started alright
so jumping right and I already went
ahead and moisturize my skin off-camera
sorry you guys are not choosing that one
today I need to have a clear skin for
Coachella
she's already breaking out a little bit
so we're leaving that one up to my
discretion but the first step of every
makeup routine is always foundation so
for today's they don't have four
different one so you guys are gonna be
choosing from being at my Holy Grail Too
Faced Born This Way my old holy girl
that I used in literally every single
video for a two year straight the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD sick did you weigh
a full coverage foundation and the $6 la
girl pro matte let's post the poll and
see what you guys have to say should I
wear today we're gonna leave this up for
five minutes and see what the results
are alright so it's been a total of
eight minutes now and it looks like it
the to base from this Wayne foundation
is winning at 38% so let's pop her on
we're never gonna apply this to my face
using a damp Beauty Blender I did just
get a brand new a sister a spray tan and
it is wearing off my face a little bit
so I don't want to see any comments
about me not matching
foundation it to my face first of all I
know I have eyes too and second of all
I'm matching it to my neck Coachella is
definitely coming up and I am so excited
and I am not about to be a Casper the
Friendly Ghost walking around so just
gotta beat a nun so our foundation is
all owner skin is looking at super
smooth and beautiful and fresh and
that's gonna be our concealer so per
today I'm gonna be choosing between uh
for concealers the color pop no filter
concealer the brand new k'kaw concealer
the Tarte tape tape concealer and also
the Maybelline fit me concealer and I
also have my setting powders here as
well then I'm gonna have you guys vote
for right away because I definitely do
not have time and between polls because
Assessor is not trying to get Creasy
so we have the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder the Too Faced sweet peach
setting powder and also the Cody or some
powder okay what concealer should I wear
and then what should I set my face let's
give those polls on five minutes and see
what you guys have to say so after a few
minutes it looks like the Tarte a shape
tape concealer is winning so far and
then for setting powder it looks like
the allure Mercier one with a forty
percent which is only one percent higher
than the sweet peach whoo so looks like
our tart shave tape is the clear winner
here with a forty to a percent boat so
we're gonna go ahead and apply that
today I'm just gonna apply this in a
triangle right below my eyes on the
sides of my nose really highlight the
center of my face then are just gonna
bounce in with my damp Beauty Blender
having a good skin day so now the
concealer is all on we are highlighted
we're gonna go ahead and set that in
place using Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder which is so anyway at 41%
Wow so far you guys are literally
picking my everyday makeup routine it
definitely is really really cool that
you guys know my makeup products that I
love and stand by that well here's the
best
gonna got my damp Beauty Blender and pop
this right underneath the eyes
our face is all set in place but we need
to add a little bit more dimension
because we're looking a little bit Flat
Stanley like so I'm gonna choose between
atomic contours what should i contour my
face way that today question mark we
have the usual very busted crusted
dusted busted rusted Kat Von D shade and
light palette we have the Anasazi
Beverly Hills contour kit we have the
next holiday and contouring palette and
lastly we have the new morphia bran
tours which are bronzer and contour duos
what blush should I wear today I'm gonna
make option number one no blush for a
very bronzy type of luck option number
two will be Mac peaches which is my
usual go-to peaches is a very orange
tone so I'm also gonna do it Mac dolly
mix which is a bright bright pink shade
and then finally edge away a blush and
highlighting do it in the shade kiss me
oh my god oh whoa okay so so far the
contouring poll literally is almost tied
with everything it's at 24 23 26 and 27
percent
let's do each one pulls ahead so after a
thousand votes the Kat Von D shade and
light palette is winning with 29 percent
and the Mac peaches blush is winning at
42% which is all my normal products that
I use in an everyday makeup routine so
what I'm thinking I love you guys I
appreciate so much the fact that you
know what all my products are like
that's honestly so so dope but let's put
a twist on this I wasn't City to be
interesting so from this point on I'm
gonna be picking all the least voted
items from the poll to keep this good
and fresh so new products are being used
so it took onto my face I'm going to use
the oddest idea contouring kit which has
a 23% and then Mac oh God
dolly max I just definitely screwed
myself over which has 11%
oh I regret this I'm gonna grab this
middle shade right here in the palette
it is the most cool toned shade and I'm
gonna use that to start chiseling out my
cheekbones Oh colors pretty oh my god
hello oh we love her she's good
definitely cannot forget to chisel out
five head she needs a little bit of work
I'm gonna lightly chisel out mine oh
that's not lightly okay well Miss
Anasazi uh she's a pigmented sister I'm
guess I'm not going to blend this out
very heavily and I'm just gonna pop on
this latest bit of the dolly books blush
that's enough that's enough I can work
with that it's for the video it's for
the video it's for the video all right
so all my face is baking in the oven
we're gonna move on to the eyebrows and
you guys know I definitely always use a
brow pencil all the time so I'm a little
bit scared because I haven't feel like
if this is continuing to go how it's
been going that this is gonna win and
that means that another option we're
gonna have to use but regardless let's
go ahead and create the pole so today's
options are going to be the benefit
précisément brow pencil the iconic
London liquid a brow cushion benefit a
foolproof brow powder which I literally
I don't think I've ever actually used in
my entire life and then the anasazi dip
brow pomade so we're a few minutes into
the pool and as of right now the anasazi
dip brow is currently winning at 39% it
is at a hot minute since I've used this
baby and as you can see she's basically
a pretty much empty this was like the
number one recipe item for getting the
James Charles block brick Lego Sharpie
eyebrow a year or two ago so I'm gonna
boot smih gooped to use this today but
you know what we're gonna do it oh wait
that's the winning I know
no we obviously use the brow powder no
ah okay just kidding I literally already
forgot that I'm switching things up so
the one who is pulling the least sorry
sweetie is the benefit foolproof brow
powder I don't think I've ever once done
my eyebrows with powder I really don't
enjoy it I feel like that would just
look weird but you know what we're gonna
make this work so I'm gonna grab this
powder and an ankle brush and try to
slay this these brows may take me a hot
second to get a snatch and on fleek I'm
a little bit scared so while I'm doing
my brows I'm actually gonna post a poll
for my eyeshadow palettes so your
sisters have plenty of time to vote
we're gonna choose between the Jaclyn
hill palette from a morphe the BH
Cosmetics take me back to Brazil palette
the anasazi Beverly Hills
soft glam eyeshadow palette
and the brand-new kkw X Mario denna
banovic palette as well all right the
poll is up now let's try to slay these
brows I think I may have a slight
advantage here being that I definitely
do already have a lot of brow hair so
this is kinda just like filling in and
shaping up but I literally cannot
imagine trying to use a brow powder
first of all that doesn't have a lot of
eyebrow hairs like Hello I use a brow
pencil or upon me because I feel like it
adds a lot of pigmentation and it really
allows to shape the brow whereas like
powder like Hello what is it even doing
where is she I feel like brow powder is
definitely for like the type of person
that wears makeup every day but doesn't
wanna look like they're wearing makeup
everyday boring cannot relate but I
think that's why I'm having so much
trouble with this because it's like
literally not showing off that I'm used
to like brick block Lego Sharpie eyebrow
moment but that's what I'm known for it
that's what I really really love I've
gotten to a point with my brows now
where I actually am really happy with
the shape and the amount of hair that I
have I can usually do them with a brow
pencil in less than time that it's at
this point both eyebrows just took me 34
minutes and they still look that I don't
think I will ever ever do that again
once both browser fill then I'm going to
use as my normal concealer that we got
from before and a flat top brush just to
clean up underneath and then use that
concealer as an eyeshadow primer or
wherever look we decide to do wow I
literally don't even know where to put
this concealer to define the brow
because I can't even see where the
eyebrow is in the first place let's move
on to eyeshadow so the poll has been up
for 20 minutes now and after 15,000
votes the Jaclyn help ella is number one
with 35% jacqueline lover girl but that
paul has been used on the channel way
too many times so at this point I'm kind
of glad we're doing this twist and a BH
soft lim is our loser today with 16% of
boats but she's not loser in my heart
because we're gonna use this palette to
create some type of look and now I'm
gonna run a poll to see it what style of
eyeshadow we should use let's see what
type of eyeshadow look should I do
question Laura
let's do cut crease let's see choice
number two could be half cut crease
choice number three smokey eye choice of
fo kirby halo
let's see what the sisters have to say
okay I clearly play myself because I
wanted to switch up but you sisters are
way too smart and you caught on to the
fact that the everyday stuff was winning
so I'm gonna reverse reverse
and go back to 15 the number one option
because I never do halo eyes so I'm
gonna put on a halo eye because 40% of
people wanna heal it why this because
I'm nuts but let's be real what James
Charles video isn't a mess I'm gonna
start off our car be in the shade
oranges soda and using that as my
transition and popping that right in my
crease so everything blends nicely
together I'm just gonna use circular
windshield wiper motions as usual but
I'm keeping the shadow actually more a
rounded shape you guys know I love a
good winged out shadow moment that
really lifts up the eyes but for a
sister halo eye I definitely wanna keep
it more round and really accentuate the
circular halo shape next of the morphe
m4 33 I'm gonna grab the sheen of burnt
orange and I'm gonna pop that right in
the crease once again making sure to
keep that eye shape a really really
circular and large we love a blended
sister okay next is the more defined
blending brush I'm going to dip into the
shade it's Janna right up in here and
use this to it define off the crease a
little bit more and then finally using a
really tiny at tapered blending brush
whoo that's a mouthful I'm gonna dip
into the shade mulberry and a little bit
of Cypress number and just really deepen
up the crease one last time I feel like
it's been a hot minute since I've done
like a darker smoky type of look I think
I've been doing it that's how it looks a
lot recently so hold even this video
let's switch it up a little bit make her
dark make her a little bit spooky why
not this outer corner still is looking
at wonky though why don't we stop blend
out it is clearly been a hot minute
since I've done my halo why because I
cannot figure out how to blend this
outer edge to save my life points let's
wait on hello so now that we have the
crease I'll blend it out and define I
want to make this into an actual halo
eye so I'm gonna grab my morphe m42 one
brush and a little bit of my concealer
from before and I guess cut the crease
those muscles of your cut crease but
just in the center portion so we can
build out that halo to do the actual
here the way I'm gonna do the same exact
colors that I used in the crease and the
same order as well popping them right on
top of the concealer and I'm gonna start
off with the shade orange soda and pop
that right in the center but I am gonna
leave a little bit of a strip in between
you know for a shimmer shadow in a
second I'm just packing the shade on
there making sure to get right up to
that line of concealer so we get that
cut halo I type of love I'm gonna grab
the shade see Jana and pop that right
next door next we're gonna use Cypress
Ember on a fluffy pencil brush and pop
this on the inner corner as well as the
outer corner next to the small concealer
brush like this one this is the morphe
at 19 I'm gonna dip into the shade or
right up here called a bronze and I'm
gonna give my brush a good spread of mac
fix+ so it's very very pigmented and
metallic and I'm gonna pop that right in
the center of that little halo so the
operative portion of the shadow is
finally Donna thank God I was not too
confident this at first but I'm really
liking the direction that's going now so
let's talk liner do we want to do it we
don't want to do it let's ask the
sisters gonna put choice one no eyeliner
choice number two winged blocked liner
choice number three glitter liner for
this portion and choice number four
would be black and glitter liner let's
see so once this pulls done am i picking
the most voted option now or the least
voted option now this would be a fast I
know what I'm doing Oh while I'm waiting
for the results to come in on the liner
Paul I'm gonna quickly go ahead and do
the eye shadow off-camera on the other
all right I'll be right back to finish
off the look so we are back and both
eyes are currently done and a slave and
as even as I could possibly get them I
always hate doing a halo eyes or eye
shapes like this because my eyes are
very very uneven and always is a little
bit wonky but you know what I'm happy
with where we're at the polls are
running for 20 minutes now and at low
state the results are black and glitter
liner is winning by 40% let's do it I'm
gonna use the Urban Decay Midnight
Cowboy glitter liner and first pop that
on the center of the lid to really make
that halo eye pop and then I'm also
gonna trace out a really thin line right
at the top of that halo to cut the halo
crease might as well go all out and be a
little bit extra at this point I'm gonna
throw in a black winged liner as well
using the NYX matte liquid liner you
guys did before a glitter liner too so
not only am I gonna put it on the lid
but let's be a little bit extra today I
want to do a double glitter winged liner
I may be regarding that but you know
what go big or go home
I forgot how hard this was to do oh my
god okay she's on there
oh that was a lot I don't even know if I
like this anymore
whatever too late now oh my god had to
throw in the other I know what okay
honestly it has been a very very very
long time since I have finished my
makeup and looked in the mirror and not
been happy with the result but for some
reason I absolutely hate how this is
turning out I don't know why but you
know what we're just gonna keep trucking
through hopefully it'll come together in
the end but next up is going to be the
eyelashes and at this point go big go
home so today we were choosing between
Lily lashes in the style mikonos house
Elijah is ikonics Lily lashes and the
style Miami's and a good and fresh 301
[Laughter]
you're kidding the poles been going for
10 minutes now and unfortunately my
sister 301 did not win we're gonna pump
on a pair of the Lily lashes Miami's
today I let I wear these all the time
are you guys I love that you know my
makeup routine so well but this video I
had never wanted a video to be over with
more in my entire life I don't know
what's going on right now let me hear
that I just accidentally cut off half
the eyelash you know how I said earlier
that lashes could potentially save this
look I lied I still don't love it but I
will say that it does look significantly
better and less like horrible with a
pair of lashes on and although it's not
my favorite look that I've ever done I
will say that it does kind of look
relatively pretty relatively okay and
maybe can be fixed with a little bit of
sister phase tune so I'm trying to stay
positive I'm kind of stay motivated
because I want to finish this video and
I'm honestly having a lot of fun doing
this so now that the eyes are all
complete let's move on to the rest of
the face starting off with highlighter
we're gonna choose between for today
starting off with mary lou manizer from
the balm the Anasazi beverly hills exxon
resi collab Anasazi beverly hills so
hollywood might go to or the jeffree
star cosmetics 24-karat highlighting
palettes the results are in and by an
overwhelming majority the jeffree star
skin frost palette won with 55% of the
vote
who I'm going to
myself a good spread of mac fix+ because
I've been having a lot of powder on my
face and I'm gonna dip into the shade
sarcophagus in this palette and get my
glow on oh you're kidding me
I know Geoffrey does not play around
when it comes to his makeup and
pigmentation but that is probably the
brightest highlighter I've ever seen in
my entire life like what the hack I was
going for a more soft and subtle look
today by I guess this is gonna have to
do I'm gonna mix a little bit of the
shade King Tut in with the sarcophagus
for the next cheek so it's not like
overwhelming wow that's insane a whole
I'm gonna pop a little bit of this right
above my brow bones as well you guys
know I love having up here to widen out
my face a little bit and just bring more
attention to this region I feel like it
gives a really really natural and
beautiful like glow from within take a
look even though this palette is not
exactly a glow from within type of the
highlighter clearly also how would you
guys feel about a sister James and
Jeffrey collab I feel like that would
low-key be kind of iconic
let me know I'm actually gonna skip out
on highlighting the inner corners today
because I really want to keep the focus
on the halo eye right in the center of
the eyes and not like in the corners of
the eyes if that makes sense but I am
gonna grab a little bit more of a
sarcophagus mixed with King Tut tap the
excess off the brush then I'm going to
use this to highlight right down the tip
of my nose Oh what from this angle this
look looks really pretty actually okay
maybe this isn't the worst only from
this angle though hmm and last but
certainly not least thank you lord if we
have the Liberty to us and for this at
once again we have four options starting
off with a glossy nude a kind of a brown
a cool tone gray lip a red or a pop of
color and I didn't pick out a color for
pop of color if that one went I'll host
a separate poll again letting everybody
else pick a pop of color let's do it you
guys want the results are in in our last
poll as
a glossy nude honestly not surprised
edit one with 36% out of 10,000 votes in
only 9 minutes you guys literally slayed
this challenge I feel like a purple or a
blue or a green what I've looked
literally is hope out of this look and I
feel like at least a glossy nude will
kind of tie everything together even
though I still hate balls you guys it is
currently for 36 here in California I
started filming this at 11:30 this
morning it has been 5 hours now this has
been a crazy wild ride we had a lot of
ups and downs
a few emotional breakdowns on the way
but we are finally done with the
completed look completely chosen by you
guys even though I'm not obsessed with
the finished look today I think that
having you guys picked my makeup routine
and products is one of the most fun
things I've ever done and I really
really really love this challenge I
forgot to say this last sowing the ultra
earlier sorry guys I was very very
focused on finishing the video and
getting my makeup off my face but thank
you so much everybody who participated
in that like seriously oh my god it
means so much to me that literally
thousands of you guys we're sitting and
literally waiting for me for five hours
life on that video to vote on those
polls and to pick which products I would
put my face like that is really really
so cool it just goes to show how amazing
you guys are and obviously we did it do
a little flip flop and I was making fun
of the fact that all my everyday makeup
products were being picked but that just
shows that you guys that really do care
about my videos and that you pay
attention to the products that I'm using
and that I'm loving so thank you at the
