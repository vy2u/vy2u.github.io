welcome back to my youtube channel a few
videos ago I did a Q&amp;amp;A and one question
you guys asked was if there were one
youtuber outside of the VT road that you
who collab with who would it be and my
answer to that was Shane Dawson and
Jenna Marbles and today my dreams came
true kind of there was a really crazy
trying to bug out on YouTube right now
we're different people try to follow and
recreate beauty gurus makeup tutorials
this is started by Thomas Humbert who
tried to follow a Jeffrey star makeup
tutorial I will link his video down
below he started this whole thing and
now it is literally blown up this
morning I woke up to a million tweets
because living legend jenna Marbles
decided to follow a James Charles makeup
tutorial I can die happy
I was so absolutely honored to have
Jenna follow one of my makeup tutorials
I was a little bit spooked on not gonna
lie because she chose the Valentine's
Day look from last year I still had my
man but Anna block eyebrows who those
are dark times we did not talk about any
more on this channel but I think she
absolutely killed the look I'm not gonna
lie I was not expecting much but I
really think sister looked so good so
definitely go check out Jenna's video go
show her at the sister love tell her I
sent you and for today's little surprise
video I thought it would be only right
to follow the trend and recreate one of
Jana's makeup tutorials without further
ado I'm gonna throw all my makeup
knowledge down the drain I no longer a
beauty guru and I'm gonna be getting
ready
using a jenna Marbles makeup tutorial
lord help me let's get started
there's stuff up on YouTube and research
the jenna Marbles makeup tutorial okay
so we have the I tried following a James
child makeup to trail that's iconic we
also have jenna Marbles drunk makeup
tutorial from five years ago
this has 23 million views hello what am
I didn't happen tutorial to get 23
million views that sounds the best ever
the fact that there's a drug to trail
it's poofy a little bit you guys know I
here on the James Charles channel we are
sober sisters but if you go like
drinking never experience is you before
okay can already tell you I'm not gonna
follow this first step this is not a
good start this is the why okay let me
see if I can find a normal tutorial okay
this is a makeup tutorial for my vlogs
for unskilled people and today that is
what I am
let's show you this I'll like I'm
watching two different people what is
going on
same-same okay even though this video
let's take its toll on a toaster oven
she looks great so hopefully I'll be
able to recreate this on me today
that is literally the team
I feel like primer and correct me if I'm
wrong for many of you guys I feel like
primer literally does nothing like every
time I use a primer if anything it just
disrupts the foundation that's actually
on my nose that's why I literally
stopped using it I only used moisturizer
anymore but I feel like primer is the
biggest gimmick in the beauty world like
what is it you can do oh my god
sisters that we are doing a full
coverage vanilla cake mix makeup today
good lord that fundation that can cover
like anything like that's enough to
cover like my scandals I don't have the
exact cream foundation that Jenna uses
but I do have the Krylon TV paint stick
which is equally as full coverage and
also a cream foundation this is
literally what I use for Drive makeup
but I guess we're gonna use this today
with a brush oh gosh
guess I'm just gonna go right in and
it's all my god this is all full
coverage my skin is crying oh my god
flash like Mary is shaking I do not even
realize how light this foundation was
hello where is the concealer the
concealer not exist yet in 2011 okay I
don't have that powder but I do have my
Mac Studio Fix Foundation which is a Mac
pressed powder that has some color to it
she is scrubbing that all over oh okay
here we go oh my god this is not true
okay sisters I don't know who thought
love either coming their marbles in the
background love a dual-purpose sister I
don't have that brush or dogs to chew on
them but I do have at my morphe M 5 to 7
News coach James returned
oh I love the place that she's going
with of all over her face okay I'm gonna
start off on the cheekbones like she did
I noticed he put a lot of this in her
eyelid at region up here and also right
across her cheeks and across her nose oh
my god I can feel the foundation on my
nose crying for help right now but you
know what
I guess we're waiting for the Sun cast
sister down I look okay well okay so
she's contouring her face right okay
let's pause and go in right in at the
hollows of the cheek bones to really
give that sunken-in sculpted look I like
that she actually described that that is
definitely correct placement and I
always do my contour in my cheeks and as
well as around the face as well that
really highlights the center of your
face which brings attention to it so
good job sister Jenna that is correct
I feel like we have reached the mountain
level of bronzer please yeah okay thank
God okay you guys know I love a good
Keith blush okay I don't have that but I
do have a Mac blush and peaches
hopefully there should be similar color
line so according to like your face
shape I like to blend it in like with my
bronzer a little bit okay me too I think
she's actually doing a really good job
of explaining or we're in a place the
products and how much to put on like how
to blend it out that's awesome good job
sister Jenna from seven years ago you're
gonna be amazed at how free and easy and
I don't care I don't care well I'm not
gonna put it based on my eyes cuz they
don't like Oh No mean everybody I really
really like this light brown color race
okay so let's say she has a duo palette
of a light light light light light brown
and a slightly darker Brown let me go
see what I have okay so I just found
this covergirl true naked eye shadow
palette it basically is like my only
palette that has light tans and browns
if you guys know what you know that I
really don't do a lot of soft makeup so
we're gonna make this work today so try
and find a clothing the sort that just
really looks natural but okay so one
thing I think she's doing a really
really good job of actually explaining
why she's picking used to color like she
talked about how she wants light matte
chicks under her eyelids really bring
attention to her eyes I think this is
actually a good tutorial sister Jenna do
you think iris everywhere are quaking in
this late Brown with this blending brush
which is totally not what you're
supposed to use it for oh really
just about right Oh God
I'm gonna take my upper 33 and dip into
this light brown shade and my nudes
palette and I guess put it all over the
eyelid with a blending brush like
genocide this is definitely not the
brush that you would normally use for
this I wouldn't usually pick something
like this a more like a flat rocker
brush to really get that color and
they're totally good that color on there
but you know what we're gonna just use a
blending brush for today and like Jenna
said we're gonna put it all over I think
this is literally doing nothing because
the amount of bronzer have on my face
right no I'm gonna take this darker
Brown and I'm taking the same brush and
then clean it and do anything to it
jacking up my crease I don't know about
the whole slopping method I can actually
feel my I kind of throbbing right now
that definitely does not feel good I'm
gonna stick to my windshield wiper
motion but you do use this I look dad
I'm just like this oh no touch up like
your temples now that you've messed them
up you do oh you know what I feel like
this is a terrible joke video oh that is
just not what you're supposed to do as
painful as that was for me to do it as a
beauty guru I am following a for China's
tutorial I do see so many people doing
that when it comes to fixing up their
eyeshadow a really great technique you
can do if you want to kind of clean it
up and make it just a little bit more to
find easy to grab a little bit of
concealer on your Beauty Blender and
just go right and and kind of just go up
against that edge and really just clean
it up doesn't do a great job of kind of
lightening up that area and defining a
little bit without ripping up all of
your foundation leaving a red spot was
just
spooky and horrible or sometimes if it's
really not looking dot bad you can take
a powder puff or your Beautyblender and
a little bit of setting powder and just
go right under just like that and wipe
it off after a little while just like
baking normally does and that shuttle
will be cleaned up and your foundation
will not be too chopped it and
completely gone like it is here papa
hunt I'm a big fan of gel liners this
brush just came with it you can use any
kind of a liner brush I'm a fan of I'm
gonna put this right before I even start
doing this I notice Jenna is talking at
her lid to get it straight across while
looking down at her marriage on her
liner this is something that is really
really common for people to do as well
but this is actually a really really bad
technique this is thing that can cause
really really bad eye wrinkles which
obviously none of us want if you're
gonna do a gel liner and you're having
trouble getting it really really even I
would recommend getting a compact mirror
like this and instead of kind of like
looking at your mirror and trying to get
it straight
hold your mirror at a downward angle
like this and hold your brush upwards
that'll give you a really easy access to
your eyelid so you have the whole thing
to look at without having to stretch it
which it was bad in the long run right
here in the corner oh like this okay
so we're doing a wing I guess as well
and Jenna is definitely right and that
when you draw an eyeliner wing you
definitely want to follow the natural
shape of your eye and generous to a baby
wing today so it's the same thing that
we are going to do if I turn to the side
and this is basically higher wing
eyeliner should look as you can see it
goes right from the bottom and it
follows my eye right up at the shape and
just comes right up into a nice point
and goes right back in to that liner
which is really really flattering for my
eye shape way too many people draw their
ring Islander going right up like that
that eyeliner shape is flattering on
literally nobody please don't do dolly
I can relate I love a good laugh okay
those look like ardell demi whispies
hold on whoa hello words explanation
where's the glue where's the tweezers
she's putting this lash entire lash may
add on with her hand even as a beauty
guru who does this as a job for a living
every single day I still struggle with
putting on eyelashes and it's one of the
hardest parts of makeup and she's just
gonna throw it on there
speed it up like it's nobody's business
I don't think so sister
don't I actually just get that on there
are you kidding me
okay lashes are on let's go into a
mascara house please tell me she did not
just glue on a pair of eyelashes about a
mascara to blend them together Oh Jenna
she liturgist that eyebrow in like 20
seconds my eyebrow process is like 20
minutes for each eyebrow okay my
genocide just gonna go right in follow
the shape
tell me where that eyebro does not even
look at that bad what is going on
thank God thank God okay
whoo I can roll with this okay I think
that's a Maybelline mascara but this is
film did she listen to Levin so I don't
even know if that's being unsold anymore
I'm gonna use the Maybelline big shot
mascara which is being sold and it's
good not only do I want to teach Jenna
how to do makeup but I also need to
teach her how to do a ton pop
desperately oh yeah so once again
there's gonna be a helpful hint when you
use black eyeliner often gives you like
a sultry sexy look but it does make your
eyes look much smaller I like to use the
white like Jenna said make sure I just
look really really big draws attention
to him and gives you like a doll like
look but God all jokes today
to make up is very very expensive but
you can definitely find it cheaper
options that is for sure
sisters preaching the truth sick uh-oh
so I described a mac lipglass and the
shade that pleased me this is the
lightest pink I could find so that's it
wait a second where's the highlighter or
has a setting spray rehearse the
studying powder our sister okay sisters
I guess we are done here and this is the
completed look for tonight looking at
this for a beauty guru standpoint if
someone who does makeup every single day
I definitely have products and
techniques that I like to use and
definitely would have loved to see added
to this tutorial but the whole point of
this video is obviously to throw all my
makeup knowledge out the window and kind
of look at this as an outsider trying to
follow a YouTube tutorial just like all
of you sisters out there I really don't
think this looks that bad
and throughout Jenna's video I actually
feel like she did a really really great
job of explaining every single step she
was doing so everyone could kind of get
it no matter what their skill level
really wise Jenna's video actually
included a lot of really really great
tips that beauty gurus tend to skip over
but that would be super helpful to any
beginner makeup wear such as using a
different brush for bronzing and
contouring no they're not the same thing
using your natural eye shape as a guide
for drawing your winged liner one of the
best tricks I've ever learned using
mascara to blend together your falsies
with your regular lashes and of course
the pros and cons of using black and
white eyeliner overall I had so much fun
following a jenna Marbles makeup
tutorial today I know how crazy she
could be in her video sometimes but I
think he was really
cool to see this more chill side of
