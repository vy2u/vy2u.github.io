welcome back to my youtube channel I
know everybody's gonna say that this is
the most hypocritical ironic video if
she doesn't 17 so far and you're
probably right
it'll be way too big of an opportunity
to pass out even though I personally do
not enjoy the movie Pennywise was the
best I feel like literally I drew one
right now with the blending brush and
some form of red lipstick is creating
their own penny wise book which is
literary so so cool to see everybody's
very own interpretations and of course I
had to do it so this is what I came up
with and it's like this glam Pennywise
that dancing cloud I put together this
red super super deep cut crease with of
course the iconic penny wise nose and a
big smile that reaches through the
entire face and I am honestly it's so
hard we call this look turned out and
with all that being said if you guys
like to see how I created this penny
wise inspired glam makeup syrup make
sure you keep on watching all right
sisters so to start off this glam
pennyways makeup tutorial I'm first
gonna go to my foundation da and today I
am using the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
stick as always but this was in the
shade @y 215 as opposed to a normal 3 of
15 or 325 depending on how tan I am I
did want to definitely go way lighter
than normal but I didn't want to go like
full on weight since we are trying to
keep this still a little bit glam and
not as spooky and then I'm just gonna
blend it out using a at damp Beauty
Blender definitely don't forget your
neck in your ears as well I do have a
costume for today's video that I'm going
to be putting on so I want to make sure
I'm going to cover my entire neck and
face of this photographs really well
and then to brighten my face just a
little bit more I'm gonna grab my Kat
Von D whiteout concealer and just put
that on the - it's my face and once
again just kind of blended out my Beauty
Blender then I'm just gonna use the
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder
as always to lock my face in place so
just off the face today obviously the
whole points that we are a dead clown
here so I'm actually for ones not gonna
go to any bronzer and I'm just gonna use
a great eyeshadow and the only one that
I could find today is in the Oprah Pro
palette I'm just gonna be using a mix of
these two shades right here even though
we are a dead clown though we still need
to look snatch so I'm just applying this
like normal using my morphe m5 30 brush
and I'm just trying to go lightly
because I don't want this to be too too
intense I'm also gonna use that same
eyeshadow shade in my morphe r39 brush
to lightly chisel out my nose and then
I'm gonna use this sugarpill single
shadow in the shade of tako to brighten
up the high points on my face
I'm gonna go ahead and do an address off
camera just to save some time and I'm
gonna do them just like always but I'm
gonna make sure that I really make sure
to draw those eyebrows up and arched as
much as possible just to give that like
a expression all right guys so now that
both brows are all done and slate and
snatched way up which gives us a lot of
room for eye shadow we're gonna move
into the eyes on Fitzie and today we're
gonna be doing a deep-ass cut crease
that I am so so excited to do this I
think it has literally been months I put
on a cut crease on my eyes I've been
doing half cut creases for far too long
now I am ready to step away so first
days are gonna be using the brand new
morphe 35o 2 palette as many of you guys
know the 35o is like an iconic palette
and this is the sister palette to it
which in my opinion is way way way
better I am so excited to play with this
I have actually not touched just yet but
yeah this is the 3502 it lunches
Thursday October 12 so if you guys wanna
check it out go ahead and check it out
you guys know coach James gets you 10%
off and let's go ahead and get started
I'm first gonna grab this shade of
chestnut on my morphe 39 brush and uses
to sketch out the crease oh my god high
pigmentation what the hell as you guys
know I'd like to do I cut it creases in
a slightly different way I always start
off by sketching in the bottom line
first and then blending upwards from
there I don't know why don't ask
it just works really really well for
this why do it however you want to do it
I'm then gonna go right in with the
shade fire on my I'm 4-3-3 brush and
begin to blend out that line okay but I
also smear my transition shade but this
is clearly uh a little pig potato so
definitely not a bad thing at Warby I
see you girls stuff in your game up I'm
gonna take nm 513 brush and attempt to
climb out a little bit you see an e36
bra so I better grab the shade of brave
which is like a dark ready orange color
and use just to darken up the crease
then I'm just gonna go back over that
with an m4 33 to make sure it's blended
out
neck's gonna take a nap 2:13 brush into
to the shade at burn bat and then once
again using that previous brush I'm
going to blend it out next under grab an
atom at 5:08 brush and dip into the
shade ways and then cut that crease one
more time I am so glad more of you
decided to add a black shade to this
palette I felt like that was the one
thing to the 35o was definitely
definitely missing so thank God it's
here this problems definite a lot more
pigmented that I was expecting which is
the opposite of a problem but this
crease is not as clean as I would
normally like it to be that is for sure
oh well I'm just gonna move on and
hopefully it'll come together all in the
end I'm sure I'm gonna grab my Kat Von D
tattoo a lot of concealer once again and
my concealer brush and just cut out that
crease and I'm gonna set the concealer
in place using my sugarpill toggle eye
shadow once again I feel like creases
always look wonky until you cut them and
then obviously being a car crease they
pull themselves together that sentence
was one that definitely did not need to
come out I'm not gonna throw in a really
quick winged liner
now before we move on to the lower lash
then obviously later on in the tutorial
my lips are going to connect up through
the eye and upwards onto the forehead so
I just want to lay out that on the upper
forehead and the lower lashline before
we move on to everything else
I'm gonna grab 513 and dip into the
shade of fire and just create a light
blending out triangle and then using a
block and I'm just gonna sketch out that
triangle I'm also to connect this
triangle down or into the cut crease
then I'm likely just gonna blend out
those black lines using Chestnut on my
e36 brush alright so now that that is
all in place we're gonna start on the
lower lash line
finally I'm versatile by carving a mix
of the shades of brick and fire on my m4
33 brush and blending those onto the
lower lash line and then similar to
above the eyebrow I'm gonna take those
shades and I'm going to blend them
downwards ever my teeth 36 percent chest
I'm going to deepen that up and then
once again just using the slightest bit
of block I'm going to lie in that
waterline so honestly loving how this is
hurting out so far and sentences a cut
crease I was gonna do black in the
waterline but don't kill me you guys I
know do this all the time but I'm gonna
grab a white eyeliner pencil I'm gonna
line the waterline and do that drive
technique that I always love to do with
the inner corner just to make those eyes
are really really big and open and kind
of more glam okay guys and that is the
shadow in one eye all complete
obviously we stopped to add lashes and
connected to the lips later on but I'm
gonna go ahead and do the other eye
off-camera quickly and I'll be right
back to finish off the rest of the luck
alright guys so both eyes are now on and
next I'm gonna grab the ofra liquid
lipstick in the shade Honolulu and we're
gonna sketch up a tiny circle on my nose
or like the clown nose then I'm just
gonna fill it in using my makeup rubber
lipstick in the shade for a1 basically
you just want to use a light red and a
dark red just add more dimension
and then with the tiny Java concealer
I'm just gonna add a little white dog to
the center of the nose next we're gonna
move on to the lips I'm just gonna do
the same exact thing lining it with the
darker red and then filling in the
center with the lighter add since
Pennywise a is like permanently smiling
I'm gonna kind of sketch in little
smiles at the end of my mouth and then
I'm going to connect those to the point
of the like blended out eyeshadow for
lifes today I'm gonna pop on the new
bouncing lashes in the style dragon Li
and then of course I'm just gonna use my
mascara to blend together the natural
lashes for the big ones so they don't
look crusty and gross
I feel like we're kind of missing
something here census is supposed to be
relatively glam makeup and you know what
that is and that is the glow highlight
so I'm gonna go ahead and take the
makeup of our starlet powder number 13
this is one my all-time favorite
blinding highlighters and it is the only
one that is like bright enough to show
up on this like white ass foundation and
with my morphe m5a1 brush I'm just gonna
apply her I lost what certainly not
least I'm just going to give myself a
good spread so using the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray of course if we
were going trick or treating or to a
Halloween party we definitely need this
to last all night long and I'm gonna go
ahead and throw on a costume and some
props and I'll be right back with the
finished look all right sisters and this
