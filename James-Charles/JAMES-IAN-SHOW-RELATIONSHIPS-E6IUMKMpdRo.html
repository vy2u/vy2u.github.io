to the first ever episode of the James
and Ian show I'll use sisters out there
now that we've even posted several
videos together on my youtube channel
and as he acts like he's hated them we
have been having a lot of fun doing them
together I'm bored of school I decided I
want to be social media famous too so we
decided that we're gonna make a video
every Sunday discussing various topics
today we'll be talking about
relationships if you were able to know
the perfect boy what would it look like
it yeah he for personality there's one
buzzfeed producer that I'm like right
now named Erik so his personalities yeah
shout out Erik I would take like one of
the Dolans bodies flap on like Cameron
dalas face and then like the talent of
Shawn Mendes no you're perfect it body
okay finally Jenner's face uh-huh Oh
that'd be a good and fresh sister I feel
like relationships for me are very like
a weird a topic to discuss being that
like you have to find some that you like
want to hang out with them be your best
friend but also like because you want to
get on top two straight boys well you
got me there when it comes to
relationship like opposites are supposed
to attract right and I'm very gay so
like if I'm in a relationship with
somebody I need someone to like balance
me out right so that's why I always go
for like very masculine muscular type
men and normally those are like the
straight it's also a fun challenge like
if you know me you know that I
definitely love a good competition and
for me getting with a straight guy is
like winning and a sister loves winning
so examine your relationships and
Jamie's convinced he's good at
relationships
excuse me I am we decided to ask you
guys you can you love problems and we're
gonna give you some really good
relationship advice yeah sister Jack
said my ex-boyfriend cheated on me two
times and wants to get back together
okay
well fool me once shame on you fool me
twice shame on me
I want to go for the third time
definitely not man did Dola responded
with broken with my ex because he was
being very control
my supposedly friend is now with him lol
okay all relationship problems aside
that is not a true friend right there
you need to cut her out of her life
before you get him out of your life kind
of both off all we ride a cow Jenna
asked my crush will not notice that I
like him and I'm so obvious about it
what do I do
holy Jenna I will just be honest with
him and tell him that you like them
because honesty is key in a relationship
demo we asked no man likes me I would do
you help of that I'll let you know when
I find out golf sister Alfonso last I'm
gay and I like a guy I don't know a
sexuality what should I do
literally welcome to my world that
sounds like I asked the question as
someone who is Ella best many many times
in the past crushing on straight boys
are boys that like you do not know what
the tea is it's sometimes important to
ask but not on an offensive way because
sexuality obviously something that is
very very private and it's nobody's
business
but their own unless they decide to
share it so usually I think it
eventually comes out in a conversation
but I definitely do have one crazy story
that I think I want to share with you
guys today okay I'm really paint the
picture for you so you can like really
relive the story with me so like there
is one social media boy yet that I will
not name for security purposes from the
south no like I message this person on
snapchat because he had posted like a
gym a flexing picture and I was like oh
wow yeah and he actually ended up
replying and he said oh my god James
Charles I can't believe you just thought
how to meet my girlfriend loves your
videos he watched them together all the
time
I don't think oh thanks so much sister I
had had makeup on because I had just
finished filming and a few minutes into
the conversation he sent back a snap
that was like wow you're the most
beautiful boy in the entire world and I
was like why and I've like thought he
was kidding like I talked to a lot of
straight guys still that like I'm not
flirty with that I'm like genuinely
friends with but they're always like
playing that game just like really get
me know one gal and it's annoying but
like I'm used to it at this point so I
thought he was kidding around we kept
talking and this boy is close to my age
and he was like you're just so
successful like at our age of how do you
do that and I was like well I work hard
he was telling me how he really wants to
move to LA and be an underwear model so
I was like okay like interesting so does
every other little white boy from the
south so
I was like well if you want to be model
let's see what she got at this point I
was thinking he was still messing with
me but he started sending a bunch of
photos in his underwear and me being the
absolute supermodel that I am I didn't
ask for input
I started critiquing his photos that's
the Oh your but luckily about in this
one like your faceless really about it
this one like get it together gal if you
want to be an underwear model
they kind of step your game up somehow
the conversation shifted to like his
body and Holly wanted to look better and
then like to relationships and asking if
I've ever been a relationship and then I
told him no what are you doing
ignore that and then whom I'll see got
my hookups which I've also all ended
very very poorly to them him saying oh I
feel like you'd give her very good if
you know where I'm going with that so I
was like yes I do but why are you asking
and he's like oh I would totally let you
at that point the realization that he
was in fact not kidding and was being
dead serious hit me like a bus going a
million miles per hour well he does that
has heard of this or he gets interesting
yeah so he started getting intense
artistry and started sending more photos
that weren't exactly appropriate if you
get what I'm putting on the table here
he was saying all this stuff and
flirting with me and he told me how he
like wants to fight a California I'm
like take me on a date and then like do
stuff at the end of the night and it to
this I was like as hot as you are and as
much as I am enjoying this conversation
I am not doing anything with you if you
have a girlfriend
and you know what he said to me I don't
he literally said and I quote she's a
huge fan of you and if I told her she
would not even care oh so she's a sister
yeah apparently a real true hardcore
sister I need to take a step with my
pink drink this is getting intense after
viewing this obviously I was like very
very shocked but I assumed because he
said that his girlfriend wouldn't care
and like knows that he's apparently not
straight that they were in some type of
like open a relationship type of
situation so after hearing that I was in
it to win it
that's all happened at like 2:00 in the
morning as well so I'm sure you can
imagine like what was going on in
this week and things started getting
really really flirty or really fast and
also very very out of hand and
apparently yeah if I photo was my -
there's obviously a lot of details to
the story that I did not need to get
into but I will say that this very long
and late night ended with him facetiming
me and doing his business after that
night fast-forward and he completely
ghosted me for two months straight
his girlfriend probably found out we're
getting in there so I sent him a really
really long message that basically said
if you do not want to talk anymore I
understand why I do not blame you I
don't want to come in between your
relationship and I do respect that but I
respect you as a person as well and I
generally had a really good time talking
to him he was super sweet that night we
talked sexual a descend that is
obviously really hard to be with and
clearly a sister was confused so I
basically said if you ever need someone
to talk to you about it that you know
you can trust and like that will give
you good advice as someone who's been
there before I got you and to that
message he literally sent back the
Rudess reply of man salty okay yeah
very very salty what really got me good
though and is the kicker of this entire
story is that it was his birthday a few
days ago no not happy birthday and he
came up with my explore page on
Instagram because I never actually
followed him in the first place but I
saw a picture of him and his girlfriend
still happily together and I noticed
that he had unfollowed me on Instagram
and I was like oh this is rude but I had
sent him a happy birthday text which is
my second message to him over the entire
process of the thing he ignored it did
not reply and at that point I was like
oh who it is game over you played with
the wrong girl but I'll putting this
aside the situation is obviously been
like on my mind for the past several
months because they caught feelings for
him fast it's very clear yeah and I also
felt really really bad for the
girlfriend after all this went down
because clearly something was going on
and I thought she knew at this point so
I sent a sister a message on Instagram
asking her to FaceTime me ASAP because
it was digging at me and I really just
wanted to tell her the truth tea
basically I told the girl from the full
story from start to finish in full
detail which was so incredibly hard for
me not only was I like super incredibly
embarrassed of what I had obviously done
being
I had no idea that she did not know what
was going on clearly he lied you didn't
do anything but it definitely was
another percent but also just seeing her
being so happy and what she thought was
a genuine relationship little bit coming
crashing down like over a FaceTime call
was just way too much to handle
obviously she was very very alarmed and
overwhelmed I mean who wouldn't be and I
told her that if she had any questions
or needed to talk to me throughout that
day that she could totally cover me I
would be there for her and she told me
that she was going to see him later on
so she would confront him about it not
even 30 minutes later I started getting
the most gross disgusting text messages
from the boy who I have not talked to it
but I've tried to reach out to several
times in the last two months I've ever
seen in my entire life they contained
racist slurs homophobic slurs just
literally everything you could possibly
imagine he literally started calling me
psycho and mentally unstable claiming
that I made everything up yeah I'm sure
you imagined him so using a show is nine
inches just wondering what was your
thought process thinking you'd make all
this up can you have a life I literally
do not know that was my thing - like why
would I literally call somebody at 10 in
the morning while I was doing my makeup
in the middle of like going to a photo
shoot just to say like hi I'm a complete
awful person and I got photos from your
boyfriend who you're in a happier
relationship with and I'm now calling
you to admit that because I care about
you and don't think you'd like deserve
that but apparently I'm lying like Hello
I did not tell that story today to try
to like expose the two people I'm
definitely not about that but I think
that this does have a really good
message behind it that a lot of people
tend to forget when they're in
relationships
sexuality is obviously a very very hard
and uncomfortable topic for a lot of
people to deal with I'm very lucky to
have an amazing support system in my
family but for people like this only
that I'm talking about it sometimes
becomes a situation where you're in the
closet or you're in denial and even
though we had a really great time on
FaceTime that one night doing all that
stuff he turned his confusion into
literal targeted homophobia towards me
and exchange for helping him which not
only put me in a really horrible
situation his beautiful girlfriend who I
spoke to and that I can tell is a really
really genuine and kind person is there
an absolutely toxic relationship that
she has absolutely no idea about and is
clearly delusional over and the boy is
gonna have to live with this in the back
of his mind for the rest of his
that not only did he cheat on his
girlfriend but he also like really
messed with me ya afternoon I would also
like to add that although relationships
might seem perfect you have to put your
own well-being first because really she
didn't and ya didn't turn out too well
it's definitely very important to listen
to the people around you who care about
you and love you because they usually
have your best intentions in mind
absolutely I think that's really just
took me at 76 years to towel but yeah do
you have any crazy girl stories maybe my
DMS are quite interesting but that's for
later video oh ho alright guys that is
