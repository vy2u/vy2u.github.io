today insisted Joey Graceffa and sister
Daniel and today we're moving a fun
makeup challenge
yeah well I'm doing channel I just did
his makeup and turn them into a boy
version of a clan I took it off but we
figured for my channel we do something
super super fun I started a little bit
of students on my channel now where I
have two friends both take one half of
my face and both compete to see who is
the better and you are we really trying
or are we trying to be no I want you
topstitch oh oh I have Oliver trigger
products right here in front of me like
always that I use in my everyday makeup
routine and I do have duplicates of only
some of them so join didn't have to
fight over something I prepared we're
gonna make it work
definitely comment down below tell me
what you guys think I should name the
series because I definitely wanna do
this a lot more often
I'm also giving the names of people that
you think we should do it to it because
big sister wants to do we're already on
to the next collab Hunger Games began
okay since we don't have a primer to
fill those pores that are not exhausted
I'm just going to go in and with this
this is my man up rubber HD stick oh I
got the beauty well you can use good in
certain percentage okay so yes we need
to conceal a kick kick were you know we
need to conceal
I need to see with shades I do have to
imitate them we can share them as well
over here okay okay what's after a
concealer yes figure it out on your own
powder color is what I need to be doing
okay next I am going to tent or marry me
Julian stop getting powder on my side
I'm going to go in on this forehead
sissy she needs her okay so I got the
temples I got the forehead I'm going in
with this I don't know what it is but he
did it on me so I feel like that's a
thing okay I used to snatch your nose no
gasp again this one will do I don't want
this is right over going but I think
that's it well you know what you like it
really pointy right some weird word
pointed he went to thee is this not
contour just what is that is up you can
use oh no Joey and we need a little bit
of luck yeah
okay I'm gonna move on to brows because
I love the brow rule of mr. brown okay
we love precisely my brow no where's
that frothing that future to love
Michelle
Danny Phantom your american dragon jake
long did you watch that show he was a
boy well so was I what did you say - I
know it was so late well sure I don't
know what to do max don't you have any
blush oh my goodness I almost forgot
about her shining shimmering splendid
sister's making his own tutorial what
are you doing
no that's a lot of something it looks
good I know we love was supportive
boyfriend I don't really know the
terminology but I know we start off with
a transitional shade maybe like a copper
lid and a new kind of look oh well I
have my packet over here here more for
you I shall pack your palette
well that'd be fun I'm gonna be using
these steel ones because they're so
sickening but we need a base coat so
we're gonna go in with this okay that's
a simple base coat right close your eyes
dark love it
singing I'm gonna blend right now
because I feel like that's what a lot of
people forget to do here this is like a
soft champagne pinky New Year's Eve
moment okay over here
tell me we're going and with the other
stealing you when you do it well I think
you've been hoarding all the on it
get away get away from my palette I want
some glitters where are those borders no
you can't have those
no I'm alarmed you know that all looks
gonna be too similar are you crazy
oh you know what I'm gonna do the thing
where people my job your under-eye what
do you think I'm doing
I'm not watch I'm not do I check for you
know oh you're gonna do exactly what
you're doing right now stay away from
her anything you're good with the man
you can see literally looks like a
morning pop downstairs something's
missing
you suck this is why we don't play board
games you're gonna be so shaken by my
side
come on yeah I'm sure that will be one
way they come on very similar reminds
better oh they do not look similar at
all rude you want to make sure that glue
is tacky tacky Lina still a bird
attacking rockety with packet a
whackadoo
I'm joining a McMahon Anastacio Beverly
Hills lip kit you look like you need a
wobbly now actually I can make this my
own color the first time probably my
sides gorgeously perfectly awesome
instead looks like a bruised lip like
somebody punched him in the mouth
mine's like cute girl going to her first
New Year's Eve partying is like going to
her last party I'm done it's not this
smiling sister oh my god editing a video
so they and I actually got myself same
thing with the list I was like I'm gonna
use one second Joey
jesus H Christ the others no it's not
good it's just more subtle
1 2 3 so let's all run sister Joey's huh
you did a lot of bronze and contouring
hangout but look how good it looks you
look warm you look fresh you look like
you just can use my gosh I was
definitely better at Daniels and tongue
I will say that I love to school it on
literally perfectly yeah it's blue it's
like right at my lashline you guys can
see that that's right yeah I can see I
know the glasses on so good the color I
actually really like I normally would
never choose lip color like this for
myself of us I couldn't do a lot but I
don't like actually like it like the
little black Jetson or sister Daniel
side foundation concealer powder at once
again you definitely didn't do as much
properly as Joey did that is for sure
but I think my skin that does look
really good sad okay so hi shadow is
definitely better than Joey sign
and that pace definitely charlyk you
picked the red color yeah but like the
darker shade in the crease of the make a
nice little of the way which is good but
I lost on the other hand looking a
little on game for de nose lips the
application was pretty good
oh man - your application is also good
for you both over line thank God thank
God the nose contour I think for both
sides as a little bit of a floppity
floppity world okay so I honestly like
both sides everything I can't even pick
a winner because Joey and Daniel both
put in a lot of effort and work which I
really really appreciate that's awesome
I think you guys for becoming future
MUAC beauty industry oh my god can they
not say anything new blood so even
though I've kept it going that I want
