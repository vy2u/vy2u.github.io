welcome back to my youtube channel so as
you can see we are in a completely new
and different setup I'm actually filming
in my old Beauty room because a few days
ago I decided last second to turn my
filming room into a walk-in closet
literally the most obnoxious first for a
problem ever but I was actually running
out of storage in my closet and I was
thinking oh my god I want to focus more
on clothes because you guys have started
to realize that I usually were the same
5 outfits like every single week which
is getting a little bit embarrassing at
this point so sister wants to step up
her fashion a for sure I decided that I
want to change my filming room into a
walk-in closet which I now have
installed and you guys will be seeing in
the apartment tour coming on very very
soon but that left me with a very weird
dilemma of not having anywhere to film
so I actually just converted my beauty
room into a beauty and filming room
mister P helped me it is so freaking
beautiful so I really really hope you
guys are enjoying the new setup it's
just a very very simple background with
shelves and paintings and got definitely
become a double O and tell me if you
like it let me know if the audio is good
let me know if the Lighting's good this
is the first video I've ever even film
sitting down here so I'm trying my best
to make sure it is all set up but of
course as we go on and things progress
I'll get better and things will be
perfect and the way they weren't before
and back to normal
James Charles quality all that being
said it for today's video as you can see
I'm wearing this bronzy very very simple
glam this is actually a kendall Jenner
inspired look her makeup artist hong van
gogh i think that's how you pronounce
his name posted a beautiful freakin
picture of Kendall on his Instagram and
I was shipped to the core and I wanted
to recreate this look so so badly
obviously the Jenner and Kardashian's
always have iconic makeup look -
everybody's voice recruiting if you guys
want to see how I created this bronzy
glowy winged out shadow moment inspired
by it kendall J herself make sure you
keep on watching alright so since this
is a super dewy and moisturized look I'm
first gonna start off by priming my face
using my a benefit total moisture cream
I've recently been loving this cream so
freakin much if you guys know me you
know that skincare is not exactly
something that I've learned a lot about
or kind of focused on in the past but
I've been trying to get into it a little
bit more recently because I'm not trying
to be you Crossley and gross by the time
I get to like 21 so I want to have nice
and glowy skin forever I have been
moisturizing a lot more recently and
I've truly been actually seen like a
major change in
I've been trying to cut out the Pepsi as
much as it hurts and drink a lot more
water too but honestly I've been ting
like such a major difference I have this
breakout so going on from my New York
trip but she's heading away she's on the
way out I told her to pack her bag
hopefully we'll be back to doing a
beautiful skin as the next few weeks
fingers crossed
in this amazing photo Kendall's makeup
artist holiday for this beautiful dewy
moisturize foundation look as always
that we all strive for but can't really
achieve because it only looks good for
about five seconds but for today's look
to recreate this as closely as possible
I'm going to use the Giorgio Armani
luminous silk foundation I'm going to be
doing a super super light coat of this
foundation all over my skin I really do
not want to do like the full coverage
today I just want a very very light
layer just even everything out but still
give us enough coverage to the point
where like our blemishes and red spots
are covered because Lord mode
thanks New York we have a lot of them
right now next gonna grab the tarts tape
tape concealer and this is in the shade
light/medium honey and I'm just going to
use these slightest bit of this just to
go over any areas that have a little bit
more breakout like right up in here here
here I'm basically discipling a super
light amount of this on any areas that
need a little bit more coverage did you
guys the luminous look has a beautiful
finish but doesn't have the most
coverage in the world so I'm just going
to use to just amp up those areas and
really make sure we have that flawless
but still dewy finish when I blend this
in I'm just blending it in super super
lightly to make sure to just pulse it in
and blend it without actually taking off
I need a product
and then to actually brighten I'm going
to grab a shave tape once again but this
time in the shade a light and I'm just
going to do a little bit of that under
both of the eyes
then I was going to grab the slightest
bit of Laura Mercier powder and I'm just
going to lightly set underneath my eyes
and that's actually about it for the
contour and bronze today for once did my
lazy Kat Von D shade and light palette
is nowhere to be seen on the front of my
table and setting up using the benefit
hoola light bronzer until pilots today
I'm using light makeup Shack t-28 brush
I think I've only used this bronzer
maybe once before because you guys know
sister James loves a good bronze cut
contour but for today's that I feel like
I just want to keep it really really
light and dewy just like the photo of
camel because it was literally so
stunning like my breath was taken away
and I want to recreate it as closely as
possible and Kendall was really not too
a contour she just had like a nice
bronze look going on for brows that I'm
going to quickly define them using my
Anasazi up repent on the shade medium at
Brown
in the photo the Kendall's makeup artist
shared she had a super super-thin and
just really really arch brows and those
things are two qualities that definitely
are not associated with James Charles
brows that's for sure
I'm just trying my best to really define
them the least amount possible and just
kind of fill them in and give it a
little bit more shape but still keep
some really really good light and airy
just like Kendall ish and lastly to
finish off the brows and it's going to
go to the Anasazi a clear brow gel and
I'm just going to brush those hairs
upwards to create the light and fluffy
feathered brow effect to primary Lister
Shanna I'm just going to adding a drop
of the shape tape light/medium honey on
the lid and then I'm just gonna blend
that in using my makeup Shack tee at 59
brush just to give a light and even base
for the little bit of shadow that we're
going to put on there but I started
today we're gonna be using the morphe
35o palette and listen I know you guys
are probably so sick of hearing all
about this palette but trust me it is
actually a really really good palette I
just feel like with a lot of celebrity
makeup we all like look at these
celebrities of this beautiful glowing
glam and we just want to recreate them
on ourselves but also times we feel as
though because they're celebrities
they're usually using like
million-dollar makeup so obviously the
3500 was a very very cheap alternative
to very very expensive palettes it is
$22 for 35 shades and you guys can use
code chains for 10% off your purchase at
morphe brushes calm and yeah it's going
to be a bomb palette to start this look
obviously use it ever a brown orange
tone palette you want to but I'm gonna
go with this baby today to lay down a
light base in the crease I'm going to go
to my makeup Shack t4 brush and dip into
this cool tone orange shade right here
so this actual makeup look Kendall had
her inner corner pretty light and then
it got more and more dark and defined as
we got to the outer corner when we get
to that super snatched upward V which I
am so excited for but yeah for the
starting shades I'm going to keep this
very very light and just make sure they
are nice and evenly blended out next I'm
gonna grab my makeup shocks t-33 brush
and dip into this warm tone orange light
up in here I'm going to focus this color
on the outer lid and then jog whatever
is left up into the crease and make sure
they are blended out and then a little
bit into the inner corner next under
grab that same exact brush and dip into
this cool tone Brown right below it and
start to define the outer corner I'm
going to be very very slow and patient
when layering this color onto that outer
third even though this look is tulsi
like that effortless glam look those
looks are usually the ones that actually
take the most amount of work ironically
enough so I'm just being a super super
careful and blending it very very slowly
and lightly to make sure we still have
everything really really blown out and
even once you get to that outer corner
I'm also taking that shadow on the tip
of the brush and I'm going to start
winging it outward
dipping into that same last dark brown
shade I'm going to grab my more feet r44
basically just use any angle brush you
want and I'm going to kind of sketch out
that little wing that kind of had it
going on
then guarding my makeup shocks - to
brush I'm just going to lightly blend
out about line and diffuse that darker
color inward
and then one left I'm going to grab that
t4 brush and just blend over those edges
to make sure everything is really really
nice and it's defined but still blended
well together now that we hope this line
all sketched out it is very very defined
looking and I'm loving how it looks but
I definitely do want to clean it up the
slightest bit but I feel like using
concealers is going to make it look 2
and 10 so what I'm going to do is grab
the Mac next to nothing studio nope just
kidding' just the next to nothing a
pressed powder and my makeup Shakti 86
brush and I'm going to dab just the
lightest bit of that and I'm going to
use that powder just to kind of sketch
the bottom just to clean it up oh yeah
that literally looks a million times
better the lower lash line normally the
first thing I would do would be line up
so we can then smoke out the shadow
below it but I actually can't find a
mile I know that I was going to use I
usually love using the NYX tan liner I
brought it out to film and now I cannot
find it anywhere so it's going to be a
benefit high brow pencil instead is this
I see I have no idea
couldn't tell you but it's a light
off-white shade so it's going to do the
job anyway okay Wow I honestly have no
idea this is even say for the eyes but
it goes on really really nicely and it's
super pigmented as well so sorry next
guess we're using benefit high brow from
now on but the lower lash line is going
to be super super simple I'm just going
to start off with my 82 brush and dip
into that cool tone Brown right below
our 4 orange key that we use on the
upper lash line and I'm just oh there
she is
I'm just using this brush and pressing
the shade right up into that lash line
just to create a little bit of a
defining moment and I am gonna bring
that shadow all the way into the inner
corner as well which is saying that I
normally don't do but Kendall had it so
we're going to do it today
next I'm just going to grab my t-49
brush and dip into the original light
orange shade that we use and just buff
out those edges
to highlight my inner corner and brag
when I'm going to go mighty 86 brush and
dip into the laura geller gilded honey
highlighter and there's going to stretch
my breasts a little bit of fix+ to make
it super intense and blinding
since we are only doing lashes today
lord knows that wearing a lot of
policies continuously it rips them out
of my face all the time which is so so
sad so I don't have very many lashes
left to work with I am going to go into
the lash curler quickly and just snatch
those lashes up so just to help without
defining a process and then for mascara
today I'm going to be using the
Maybelline Big Shot mascara
all right so that's when I complete I'm
going to go into the other one
off-camera quickly and then I'll be
right back to finish off the rest of the
face alright and that is both eyes all
complete and the next step of course is
going to be the glow I'm going to use
once again gilded honey and I'm going to
use my luck C 560 brush and I'm going to
dip into this and I'm going to put this
right on the highest point of my
cheekbones
now I we normally would never use fan
brush when it comes to highlighting
because I don't know I just have never
like learn to use them but I was
watching desi Perkins do videos today
where she tell her subscribers on how to
cover up cystic acne and it looked so
beyond Bom I was like so intrigued the
entire video but I notice when she got
to her highlighter she used a fan brush
and I just looked so freaking pretty
sounds like you know what if does he
looks hot I want to look hot too so I'm
trying this out today and honestly so
far I don't actually hate it
we're also going to use this more so I'm
going to apply it right on the tops of
my brow bone on my forehead for that
healthy and natural glow okay I'm
actually really liking the way that a
fan brush applies highlighter this could
be like a freaking revelation up in here
oh that looks so pretty what I'm going
to grow that same highlighter on a tiny
pencil brush and I'm going to use this
to highlight my nose now to finish this
look off all we have left is lips I'm
first going to the Mac stripped down
liner and just over line my lips the
slightest bit to give me a little bit
more dimension oh my god these sirens
are so annoying
are we done yet nope as of the lips
today we're going to using the new dose
of colors lipstick in the shade
butterscotch
just as our going to top these slightest
it because we're looking a little bit
concealer here right now I'm going to go
into the to base new melted latex liquid
gloss stick thing and put it on my lips
no
oh okay so I'm not really sure what you
would call this color now that we have
put on a lip liner a lipstick and then a
gloss over top and then wipe off the
gloss because we didn't like it but
whatever is like left on the face right
now is exactly what I was going for so I
guess we're going to leave it there I
want to clean up alright guys so this is
the completed kendall jenner inspired
look I'm honestly freaking living for
how this turned out I feel so beautiful
and bronze and just smashed even though
we're not even wearing that much makeup
