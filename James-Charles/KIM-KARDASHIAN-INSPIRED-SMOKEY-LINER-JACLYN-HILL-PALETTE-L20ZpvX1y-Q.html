welcome back to my youtube channel so as
you can see today I am rocking this
super super symbol but also get super
glam and effective black smoked out
winged liner I freaking love how this
look turned out and is of course
inspired by the legendary Kim K herself
and this picture that Mario jetavana
dick posted on his Instagram I know I
just did a k'kaw Beauty review and a
kendall Jenner inspired look a few weeks
ago but I cannot even begin to explain
when I saw this original picture of my
mouth drops to the floor it was just so
beautiful and so stunning but also so
simple and effective at the same time I
just needed to recreate it and show you
guys how to do it
before we actually get into this look I
have just a little something for you
guys and that is going to be a giveaway
so as you guys know and if you saw my
video from a few weeks ago the Java and
Hill &amp;amp; morphe brushes collab just
launched and is probably one of the best
talents of all time I do actually use
this palette in the video today but
obviously I use like my crusty dusty
used version not the brand new one when
the original palette launched it did end
up selling out in only 45 minutes and
that left a ton of you guys about in
your hand so I thought it would be a
perfect giveaway being that the palette
does actually restock tomorrow morning
at 8 a.m. California time of course you
can use code exchange for 10% off as
always you guys need to get your hands
on this thing but just in case you can't
I will be giving away one of these
babies right here and I'm so freaking
excited to tell you how all you have to
do to enter yourself to win is go give
this video a big thumbs up down below
come on go do it right now sister and
then just leave a comment I need comment
whenever you want say say hello say this
makeup look looks amazing say what
you're eating for breakfast this morning
I don't really care just leave some
comment and I will instantly enter you
to win I'll pick a winner one week from
Senate and I will contact you by DM to
let you know that you won and after your
like address and everything and then of
course update the description and to let
you guys know the contest is closed good
luck you guys and back to the video if
you want to see how I created this
smokey winged L Kim Kardashian inspired
makeup look make sure you keep on
watching
alright there already went ahead and
prime my face using my benefit total
moisture moisturizer and then my benefit
Porefessional primer as always I'm going
to put on a headband here because my
hair is looking a real real wonky today
and it's not styling for the life of me
so I kind of just gave up I'm going to
throw in a hat as soon as possible just
bear with me while I do my base here and
I promise
I will fix this situation in a few
minute
for my foundation today as always I'm
gonna be using my makeup ever Ultra HD
foundation stick in the shade of y 335
and I'm just going to put this all over
my face but I'm actually not going to
use too much of it today and then of
course it's going to take my damp Beauty
blender and blend this in for concealer
today we're going to be using of course
my heart shape tape concealer the Holy
Grail and today I'm using the shade
light I've usually been using the shade
light/medium honey recently but in the
photo Kim definitely has some very very
very high contrast between the rest of
her face and her like t-zone region
being her under eyes in the very center
for forehead so I do want to recruit
that as much as possible and add that
original 2010 at Kim K style of glam I'm
so freakin excited to see the fact that
she's definitely going back to her like
roots with the full-on full coverage
glam
I missed that Kim so much as by for my
favorite era of her I do obviously love
the natural face she's in as well as I
said a million times in the past few
videos but you always got to go back to
your roots at some point
all right so I just went ahead and
quickly set my face and locked it in
place using my Too Faced Born This Way
ethereal setting powder I have a very
very exciting and fun video coming out
in a few weeks from now about setting
powders and the battle between them and
flash flag and everything you could
possibly think of because lord knows I
am the queen of setting powders and
flash photos so definitely stay tuned
for that coming soon so in the photo
that Mario posted Kim was definitely
super super bronzed and contoured so of
course I want to recreate that as much
as possible because y'all know I love a
good bronze and contoured look so of
course I'm going to start off by giving
my benefit hoola bronzer and my morphe
m5 70 brush and you can use code at
James for 10% off your purchase at
morphe brushes comm I'm just going to
start chiseling out my cheekbones and
really warming up the outside edges of
my face I am definitely having a decent
amount of this product when I actually
go in I am going pretty light handed
with this brush because I do want a lot
of products on there but I want to build
it up slowly over time because if we put
a lot on there at one time is just going
to get super super muddy and obviously
we want it to be super super punch out
and nice and beautiful and bronzy so I
am just being pretty careful to go nice
and slow and just disperse the color
evenly all throughout my face I'm also
going to use this color to bronze up my
forehead as always
I'm also gonna grab my @jt waiting 182
Luxy 1kg brush oh my god and dip it into
a little bit more of hoola bronzer just
to lightly contour my nose I'm actually
not going to do the very signature
gnash James Charles nose I just want to
do a light contour just a little
something but definitely not super super
intense because it just going to look
very very wonky with the foot because we
do want to go for that natural more dewy
skin alright so you guys know I'm a very
very loyal more if you stand up but
there's one nod morphe brush that i have
been Athlete up tested lately and that
is the makeup shack t89 brush it's just
this fluffy brush and I am going to grab
this using my Kat Von D shade and light
palette and I'm going to take them to it
the darkest shade of the contour palette
and I am going to definitely dust off
that brush because I don't want too much
but I've been loving this brush for just
going in the very very very hollow of my
cheek bone right in the bottom of that
contour I feel like it really defines
the contour so well it also allows you
to blend it out so you don't get that
like really really harsh line but it
definitely does look super super cut and
defined and natural and then of course
I'm just going to go back into my
original m5 70 for more feet and just
blend that oh and like oh my god look at
over that look it looks like a natural
super super defined Angelina Jolie cheek
bone I freaking love these two brushes
together it's a match made in heaven I
don't want to bake today just because I
do want my skin to be really really
moist and hydrated but the one thing I
am going to do is grab my Beauty Blender
and just admit to a tiny bit of that
setting powder and just lock in the
sides of my nose just to stash that nose
contour a little bit and just to hold it
in place because it's already getting
oily because of these studio lights in
front of me and it is very very hot in
California today so I definitely don't
my nose to melt aw
okay finally I can take this stupid
headband off and replace it with my hat
thank God alright so for blush today you
guys know that I usually use Mac peaches
this is my all-time favorite blush but
for today I'm actually going to exchange
that and I'm going to be using the Mac
blushes in the shade spring sheen
instead this is actually very very
similar color to peaches when you put
them next to each other but spring Sheen
does have a little bit of shimmer to it
which is perfect because we definitely
want that radiant skin look and we are
gonna be using a lot of gold on high
later as well so this will just do a
good job of mending everything together
alright so I just went ahead and quickly
did my brows and my eye primer
off-camera you guys'd me do a million
times out there is no point in including
it let's go ahead and get started on a
we're all waiting for and that is the
eye shadow so far this I said a look
today i believe in the morphe X
chocolate Hill
eyes shadow palette now obviously this
look is mostly black liner which is the
pinch of brown and warm tone orange but
this palette is just so freakin bombing
so pigmented as I'm sure you've heard it
literally everybody in their mothers say
it but it is actually true so if you're
watching this today on Monday the 17th
this palette is actually relaunching and
coming back in stock tomorrow Tuesday
the 18th and I know so many of you guys
missed you much in the launch it sold
out at only 45 minutes and I know not a
lot of people were able to get their
hands on them which is why I'm doing the
giveaway in the beginning of the video
like to talked about so if you have not
thumbs up this video and comment down
below definitely go do that but like I
said this will be restocking tomorrow so
if you would like to try it it goes live
at 10 a.m. and you can use code James
for 10% off your purchase this palette
is something you need in your collection
I am not kidding when I say it is so
beyond good before we get into the
actual liner I do just want to find my
crease a little bit and for this I'm
gonna grab my morphe M 4-3-3 brush and
dip into the shade butter and just put
this right into the crease this step is
definitely not vital you can totally
skip out and go right to the liner
portion but since I did up probably my
eyelids with some concealer and not like
a transparent primer I just want to add
a little bit of dimension back into my
eyelid but that's just personal
preference I'm going to take a quick
break from the palette for a second and
I'm going to grab my Inglot gel liner in
the shade block obviously to start off
this wing and just catch us on videos
like sigma e06 winged liner brush
it has been so lost egg on the wing
liner using a gel liner my hands are
shaking so hard corporate some reason I
don't know why I'm like so nervous to do
this oh my god
with this liner I'm also going to make
sure to tight line my waterline as well
because there's definitely a very very
smoky look going on all right I just 100
like tight lined off camera using my age
away at black pencil clearly that
situation was not working out too well
and I do not want to risk anything again
and of course I still managed to somehow
smudge black liner onto my lid but you
know we're just going to do with it
we're going to move on alright so going
back to my tiny little liner brush I'm
going to dip into the English L liner
one last time I'm gonna draw this little
wing in the center corner of the eye
look this is obviously featured in Kim's
book and this is a very very popular
technique in Arabic makeup that just is
so so freakin beautiful I personally
have a very very hard time doing this
because I do have a little bit of skin
that actually covers my inner corner but
I'm just going to draw over and hope
that it works kind of now going back
into the door female I'm going to grab
my two one two brush and I'm just going
to dip into the shade a bit which is
just as black in the bottom corner it is
so freaking pigmented and we were going
to use that shade to smoke out our liner
today this looks awful okay this one
looks awful so I'm going to try to take
off the outer wing portion
how you ask I have no idea all right now
that the wing isn't taking up our entire
eyelid let's go ahead and try this again
ever might you want to do it once again
it dipping into a bit let's go ahead and
smoke out this liner very very carefully
the nerves looked around my makeup
Shakti to brush and I'm just going to
smoke out the edges once again and then
finally my morphe m56 one
we honestly for an i we had a completely
perform surgery on this really did not
turn out that bad thank God I'm let's go
back to you to brush and dab back into
abyss and I'm going to smoke out the
lower lash line as well I'm just giving
this color super super close to the lash
line because we do want that smoky
effect but not bringing it down to low
because we don't want it to be really
really overpowering and especially
making sure to really consider that
color on at the outer corner and
connecting up to it the wing to really
like circulate and complete the eye I'm
going to go to my m56 one brush and just
Buffalo at the edge make sure it's not
going too low as you can see this look
is actually super super simple to
achieve it just looks complicated and
you definitely need to be careful
because of the block I can definitely
end up everywhere as you just saw so
just be careful when you're blending but
let's go ahead and move on to it the
lashes so for the last of the day I
definitely I just feeling very very
natural in the picture of Kim she's
actually only wearing mascara which
makes me so freakin angry like oh the
fact that anybody can have natural
lashes that good is so beyond me because
unfortunately I cannot relate so for the
last today I just want to use the ardell
demi whispies these are very very
natural pair I used to use these on all
the girls in my local hometown when I
did their prom makeup they're just very
very beautiful but definitely are just a
little bit of something some of this I'm
just going to glue them on of course as
always
and then just to blend my irregular
lashes with my fake ones together I'm
going to grab my benefit roller lash
mascara and just apply a very very light
coat so both eyes are now complete and
of course the next type is going to be
the glow I know I use this one all the
time
but first addenda be using my honest on
vo so Hollywood illuminator this is one
of my all-time faves and for this look
we definitely do want to be super super
gold and I cannot think of a better gold
highlighter than this one and to apply
on abusing my morphe EMB 23 brush wow
yeah and you guys know normally I would
use my morphe M 501 brushes it's like my
go-to highlighter but recently I've been
actually loving using a smaller brushes
of 4 highlighters to get like a more
precise and confined highlighter I don't
know if you think I'm getting a board of
like the look of highlighter like
everywhere all over the face I doesn't
really love you to look like a natural
natural tiny defined
highlighter moment I don't know personal
preference do whatever you want
oh my god yes this literally looks so
frickin pretty Wow ok
this area of my forehead is actually so
my favorite place is a Holly on my
entire face I've been getting a lot of
questions about it lately - everyone's
like why the hell are you highlighting
your forehead I thought you wanted to
make it look smaller and well yes I just
we do that as for sure when you
would sweat obviously this one is going
to hit the light and it's going to
reflect naturally where the light or
where the liquid is on your face that's
just how science works Wow
so by adding highlighter here and making
that light and hit it and catch it it
just helps to kind of further along the
look at that dewy not your foundation
because not all of us unfortunately can
be blessed with that beautiful glowing
skin but we got to figure till we make
it for list today I'm first gonna go to
the dose of colors new lipstick in the
shade
Kim definitely was wearing a glossy lip
as well so I'm going to layer over top
of the mac lipglass in the shade
see-through as well and then for one
final pop I'm just going to layer these
away skinny dip lip topper right in the
center of the bottom lip just for a
little bit of gold glitter realness oh I
almost forgot to highlight my
collarbones as well alright guys that is
the Kim K inspired Arabic black winged
out smokey eye I freaking love how this
will turn out I think it is so beautiful
and sunny as I said before I really
never ever did these like inner corner
points but I honestly really really like
how it looks today I'm kind of shook if
