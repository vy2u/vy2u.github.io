welcome back to my youtube channel
cutting straight to the point as you can
see from the panel down below and that
amazing intro clip today's video is
going to be reviewing the brand new at
k'kaw Kim kardashian-west
beauty line I have been a huge fan of
kim kardashian for a very very long time
now I think she is so beautiful so
amazing and so talented and yes I do say
talented because proposals of what you
think about her she turned one little
video into a billion-dollar Empire her
and her family they are by far the most
famous family in the entire world and I
respect their business mindset so
freaking much they're absolute geniuses
as much as I do love Kimmy Robert at
that being said she did just released a
beauty line I am a beauty guru and that
means today's video is essentially a
review and it is going to be completely
and brutally honest no one is saved
not even sister Kim alright I'm not
rambling without further ado let's go
ahead and get on with the video alright
so before we actually hop in and test
out the contoured six I do want to apply
a little bit of a base I was just
watching the Beauty tutorials on k'kaw
comm with Kim and Mario and kill would
definitely bring a little bit of a base
when Mario did her makeup just for a
quick light base I'm going to go in
apply the Giorgio Armani luminous the
foundation in the shade 3.5 you guys
know if you follow me on Santa this is
actually not my favorite foundation I'm
not the best experiences but I do know
Kim loved it and I want to do my best to
recreate her look as much as possible
and I'm also just going to quickly
define my brows using my Anasazi
eyebrows in the shade medium drums to
give a little bit more shape to my face
alright so now that the base is all on
and I'm looking a little bit less pimply
and red let's go ahead and move on and
test out these contour six looking at
the k'kaw Beauty website right now there
are four different subset logs and they
have the cream concert highlighting kits
they're all thought out so major forgot
to camp but when they were sold they did
launch for forty five dollars each
so for forty five dollars are actually
getting two different shades of contour
stick two different highlighters one
being matte and one being simmering and
a dual ended brush one being a kabuki
brush and one being like a little sponge
on the end so honestly $45 you're
getting six things now I obviously have
nothing on my face yet so I cannot
really tell you if it's worth it but for
the number of things are getting and the
price definitely a pretty good deal now
the kids do comment for different shades
being light medium dark and deep dark
now four shades may not seem like a lot
but being at the actual event yesterday
and seeing them all in person it goes
from really really light to a deep dark
and trusted the deep dark was actually
pretty dark that is so awesome like
Emma's not forgetting about all the dark
girls out there because obviously they
exist I have been deciding between a
light and medium but for today's video I
think I'm going to be actually using the
medium kit y'all know that I do like
being a little bit more broad and we're
not trying to have another flash like
marry moment so I am using the medium
camp for today I'm going to open up
medium in just a second but that does
leave you with light dark and deep dark
to youth and let's Cyril I am definitely
not going to be using these two so I
don't want to give them away to you guys
leave if they did sell out super fast so
if anybody's one of these that wasn't
able to get their hands on it make sure
get this video a big thumbs up down
below and then leave me a comment and I
will definitely be picking a winner on
Monday's video to give these kiss away
for you guys alright so let's go ahead
and open up the medium set and honestly
living this packaging as a nude classic
bag it's really really cute to be honest
I really really like it oh oh my god
okay so the product actually covered in
airtight sealed packets as well which is
super awesome means they're going to be
a fresh and definitely not like damaged
by the mail anything
is amazing love her and don't love the
fact that I forgot to bring a pair of
scissors in that campus is open okay so
as promised if that comes with two
highlighting contour six then a brush as
well so if my hands with these two at
the top first instincts I gather
packaging is super cute this is super
cute this all a lot smaller than I
expected to looking at the Instagram
post it's also going to be a whole lot
bigger like I would make it like M four
three nine more pieces kabuki brush but
I was definitely wrong so I'm definitely
curious to see how this actually going
to work on the face but not going to
judge until we try obviously so like I
said I already have a light base of
foundation on so the first thing I want
to do is going to be highlighting sick
and I'm going to open up this end
correct with the matte highlighting
shade and other these is under the eyes
just to brighten up the high points of
my face
like I said it's gonna go right and use
like a normal concealer oh okay this is
much softer than I was expecting
oh my bed it feels really really good
this for most honestly going on really
really nicely I'm just putting in all
the high points my face where I'm not
only put my concealer and then I'm just
gonna try to blend it in with the actual
sponge to see how it actually it blends
together president Park is all I'm just
going to use these sponge to blend it
and but similar to a Beauty Blender I
definitely want to wet it so I'm just
going to spritz it using my car Ready
Set radiant skin mist just to get it a
little wet we're going to glide in
blender in okay so looking at this
close-up this sponge definitely takes
off a lot of the product like I don't
know if you can see actually on camera
but my skin is definitely showing
sitter's I don't know about this lunge I
think I wanted to cast my face using the
sponge on the end of the brush and then
the other half using of my Beauty
Blender oh good idea James so then we
can see how they actually compare
because I want to give the product a
Faversham I sweat head and I apply it
more matte for later to the other side
of my face on you sponge on this is
definitely a major fail for me it's
picking up a lot of the product and it's
just not letting out very very nicely
but I haven't used a kabuki brush or and
I get to this when we get to the contour
but this one's definitely not my
favorite I am going to go ahead and use
my Beauty Blender just to blend
everything else out though because I
want to get the power to fair chance you
haven't even got to see what it looks
like yes I'll look ahead and wonder out
all right there we go
so much better oh my god when in doubt
beauty blend it out alright so once it's
all blended up it is definitely
we're literally beautiful on the skin
I'm thinking that this was probably a
medium type coverage it definitely like
even everything out and actually did a
pretty good job of covering my under-eye
bags as well but it definitely is like
not full coverage because I can still
see my skin underneath it but I do like
that so this is definitely a pretty good
product so far definitely does not like
being a sponge but I'm glad we went in
with the Beauty Blender because this is
pretty bomb we'll get back to the
shimmer end of the highlighting stick
towards the end of the video but let's
move on with the contour so opening up
the stick we have a light contour end
and a darker contour and this is the
medium stick keep in mind and in the
video that camp posted she said she
likes to use the lighter end of the
sticks doing her nose contour and
sometimes even like eyeshadow under and
lower but she liked to use the darker
sticks to contour the rest of her face
so we're gonna do the exact same thing
today impersonating the lighter end of
the stick to it snatch my nose
I would like to contour the bottom
window so it's kind of like lift it up
it just gives it a little bit of like a
cute doll like a fat and you guys know
that I definitely love a good at pinch
nose I'm putting these lines pretty
close together okay I'm now just
realizing that I happen to use the
darker end of the stick or nose contour
and not the light or Adams Madison if I
like actually paid attention took my
time on something for three seconds okay
okay so moving on what's going to the
contour and I'm first going to use the
lighter end of the stick it's almost
like a bronzer so this goes with this
end the hollow that'll Bluetooth brings
pretty far up as well on both sides and
I'm just waiting this right underneath
my cheekbone to really lift it up and
chisel it out but I'm also going to have
this lighter shade and I'm going to put
it right on the forehead because y'all
know that I hate my biggest right and I
like to make her look as short and small
as possible next going back into the
darker and I'm going to use this to
really contour out the deep earth plane
that'd be like the very outside edge of
the forehead and then the very very
bottom of the cheekbones as well as the
jaw line to really chisel for all
all right so like I said the sponge was
definitely not my favorite but the
Kabuki end is still here so they want to
give this a shot and test it out with
the contour
I'm not really sure who in their right
mind would ever contour their nose you
thinking keepers but that really should
not do dap out of a job of blending it
out i am going to quickly go back in
with that highlighting stick and just
need to find the highways of nose
because we will kind of be in smash i
definitely did put a lot of colorado
salt i am going to go back and once
again with a highlighting stick
underneath just to redefine it a little
bit oh my god yeah when you use the
Beautyblender this literally blends out
so nice and evenly like this looks so
freakin good
okay so once it's all blended out this
honestly does look really really really
pretty similar to the highlighting SiC
the contour stick formula is bomb it
blends out so beautifully and looks
really really natural on the skin which
i love definitely not full coverage but
enough coverage what we're like you get
the color there and it makes a beautiful
impact after the Kabuki brush it's not
bad I am someone who never ever uses
brushes to blend out creams or
foundation I miss out the fate of
artists I really have never understand
people do just because I feel like
kabuki brushes do always rub a
foundation it kind of makes things look
at even that being said this did one out
really really nicely it honestly was not
really rubbing off to foundation it just
went on really really beautifully it
applied nicely but I didn't have to
really work it actually kind of like do
a mixture of winter labor motions and
topping to make sure I wasn't lifting
anything up but once it was applied was
definitely applied and looked nice I'm
just really not a brush type of person
but you might be so definitely check
this out it's not bad this on the other
hand it's not great
alright so now that all the cons right
is on complete let's go ahead and get
the glow on so for this we're going to
use these shimmery part of the
highlighting stick obviously let's go
ahead and do a little swatch on the hand
if you look well what actually looks
really really pretty something like a
very very subtle not the lines and glow
but that's definitely what Kim was going
for when she was talking about this back
after a definite is like a glove from
with Anik the let's see how she applies
on the face when you lift up her on at
the center of you know who this is
already really pretty and then down the
nose bridge in the inner corners on the
of course I've been loving putting a
little bit of powder up here recently -
for that like Julie forehand sloth and
then also on the cheese well then I'm
using my beauty butter and lightly a
blemish out oh okay not bad as you can
see it's definitely pretty it's not
aligning by any means but I actually
really really like that now don't get me
wrong you guys know I love I've got a
blinding highlight all the time but I
think this product is really really good
for just like the everyday person who
just want to like look really
moisturized radiant like glowing from
within but doesn't wanna look like they
have 54 different pounds of like
metallic highlighting glow pigment all
over their faces like I said I've been
following him for a very very long time
and we all know she's 2pac on the makeup
like hold the full contour full eye
shadow glam highlight to the God of War
III she's been rockin linked to very
very dewy natural just moisturize skin
look and I think she looks so beyond
beautiful so this set is definitely like
her new makeup style packed into one set
and I really like that alright so now
that all the products are locked in and
we're looking nice in gnashed in the
video is Ken Mario definitely
recommended using a light coat of
setting powder just to set everything in
place and actually so be on chef right
now because I completely forgot about
the fact that there is not an ounce of
powder on my face yet this is literally
all liquid foundation and then cream
products over top but you guys know that
I definitely love packing on the powder
a lot but there's literally no powder on
my face from this looks so beautiful
like there's no creasing it just looks
natural and I'm honestly living for it
oh my god I'm just going to do the
lightest dusting of powder just with my
touch my face it doesn't like come right
off or anything alright so that is the
base I'll complete I'm honestly really
really liking how this looks so far and
laughs it finally not least in the
videos Kim said she does use these for
her eyeshadow as well so why not just
try something out let's just stick a
little bit on there I don't have
anywhere to go might as well give it a
shot grabbing the lighter end of the
condom stick I'm just going to place
this right on the eyelid
but our cities my fingers to lightly run
this out and then grabbing the darker
and I'm going to go in the inner and
outer corners to kind of creating it to
find halo I type of of that and then
once again just having my fingers to
lightly blend it out and then for a pop
I'm going to grab the shimmery
highlighter and I'm going to place on
the center of the latest oh that looks
really pretty okay Wow we literally just
created a bronzy halo and a matter of
like two minutes and honestly it does
not look half bad I'm going to read and
I'm going to lock my face in place using
the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray medicine finished look alright so
let's go ahead and talk about these
products all right so once again the
k'kaw be dehydrating contouring cream
set comes with two dual ended contour
six and another dual ended brush and
sponge contraption thingy after the
holiday and contouring stick they
definitely have like a medium level of
coverage they do a good job of like
evening everything out and just giving a
nice little defining moment but they are
overpowering to the point where you're
like full coverage hiding pimple acne
and stuff like that you can still see
your natural skin underneath which I
personally like if you are a full
coverage type of person you can
definitely layer and build it up but
regardless their mom has a sister right
here this is definitely more of a Miss
for me I'd really didn't like the sponge
it's definitely pretty doesn't I just
really get into that great of a job of
really blending off the product I felt
as though it was really removing the
product rather than actually blending it
and that's obviously never what we want
as for the kabuki brush and it actually
went on a very very nicely
I definitely think really really careful
and had to work on a little bit more but
when I was doing it does definitely did
a really great job of just flooding off
the product evenly and smoothly without
working on any of the foundation which
is really really great because I
definitely have a personal vendetta
against using brushes for foundations
but this obviously did a really really
great job I definitely loved using the
Beauty Leonard above these now it just
did so much of a better job but this
definitely is not bad by any means I
just really didn't like the sponge and
I'm not really a brush person but it's
really not bad and not even being fed
obviously it's her first launched her
first collection these products are
brand spanking new so it's not like
everything to be perfect on the first
try let's be real look at sister Kylie
for example so many things are wrong in
the first launch but now after many many
launches in need
she arguably has some of the best on the
market so I definitely think is going to
take a lot of launches and stuff to Kim
to get everything perfect but definitely
a really really great estar do I think
this collection is worth checking out
for $45 absolutely even if you exclude
the blending tool you're still getting
four different shades of highlighting
and contouring sticks for only $45 I
think that is so bob especially being
associated with a celebrity name like
Kim Kardashian you're definitely going
to want to check these guys out alright
