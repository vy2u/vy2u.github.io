welcome back to my youtube channel oh if
you really thought we were done with
just those brushes you were wrong sister
in case you guys been living under a
rock living legend Kylie Jenner just
released a ton of brand-new products to
her makeup line for the holiday season
not only did she released two eyeshadow
palettes but she also sent the beauty
world into flames and she announced her
$360 luxury brush set I disagree review
on that in the last video so if you have
not yet checked out my brand new video
on that make sure look like right up
here but she also launched a full line
of concealers just like always that ever
Kylie's name was attached there has been
a ton of controversy on these babies
right up in here so I got my hands on
the full line of all 30 concealers and
today we're gonna put them to the test
you guys know that I am a loyal Stan of
the tape tape concealer I love this and
I use this all the time and almost every
single look but not even gonna lie I am
getting a little bit bored of having the
same exact makeup routine every single
time I have another point right now
where I just want to be more creative
and try out new products so who knows
maybe this concealers will be amazing
but we're about to find out just to
clarify as usual when it comes to
reviews because you guys know some
people are crazy in that comment section
this video is not sponsored I am NOT
being paid to say anything
I love Kylie but I'm not on her PR list
so this is completely unbiased even
playing field these might be amazing it
these might suck we're gonna find out
together
we're laut further ado let's go ahead
and jump into the review
so before we actually go into their
makeup routine today let's go ahead and
talk about the actual product itself so
the day that I'm filming this is
December 13 I'm not exactly sure when
this video is going to go but it should
be up relatively soon after that but the
skin concealers launched today on Kylie
cosmetics and she says they are
lightweight and designed to give a
flawless skin line finish contrary to
Kylie's absolutely ridiculous price tag
on her breasts at these consumers will
be retailing for twenty dollars each on
her website when these launched which I
actually feel as a very very fair price
looking at Sephora I'm looking at other
concealer prices like the NARS radiant
creamy concealer I think it's $30 Urban
Decay Naked skin I think is 29 the NARS
soft concealer is 30 Kat Von D is 26
makeup forever is 34 it cosmetics is 24
and then I believe shape tape is 28 if
I'm correct so this is definitely
honestly on the lower end of some of the
concealer price tags this is the kikuna
it comes in and based on the bottom of
the package it comes with a point 22
fluid ounces of product in comparison to
shape tape my shape tape has point 33
fluid ounces of product so you get a
little bit more and this and then the
very popular color pop no filter
concealer comes with only point 14 fluid
ounces so this is probably a middle of
the line when it comes to actual amount
of product that you're given moving on
let's go ahead and talk about the shade
range because that has also been a very
very controversial subject of this
launch
so Kylie's concealers launched with 30
different shades starting with the shade
of pearl in the top left with the
lightest shade and the bottom right
shade being a cocoa which is the darkest
looking at the contrast between the
lightest shade and the darkest shade
together I think that this contrast is
honestly very very impressive
there's obviously a huge lack of
diversity in the makeup industry and I
really wish brands would start to
recognize more people of color bloggers
there are so many beautiful and talented
ones out that that deserve equally as
much cosmetic recognition I really wish
it wasn't the case for a shade this dark
is like something to applaud over but
like I said the laka diversity and the
beauty industry has caused it to be so
honestly good job sister Kylie for doing
this obviously a few months ago Rihanna
dropped her fenty beauty line which
literally had the entire nation shook
she had 40 different colors in her
foundation which i think was so so
incredible and honestly I think she set
the standard for future launches
literally every time I go into Sephora
at this point most of the middle section
and literally the entire darker section
of the fancy Beauty line is always all
about what you think is
so great but a lot of people are
comparing this launch of Kylie's
concealers to Fenty beauty's foundation
having darker foundation chase has
always been a major issue for a lot of
huge beauty brands and I think venti
vidi has now really changed the game
when it comes to shade range a lot of
people are very very angry with Kylie
and a lot of people are saying that
she's just copying Rihanna and my
opinion it feels a little bit weird to
fight in favor of a really really large
shade range which is really really great
but that have Kylie come out with her 30
different shades and then turn around
and say that she's doing it wrong and
get angry with her forehead I don't know
though I am definitely not in a place to
be showing my opinions about this and I
don't want to speak over anybody so I'm
definitely looking forward to watching
hopefully ducky I know Alyssa Ashley
uneven tanks video about these
concealers because I really want to hear
what they have to say quickly before we
begin I want to swatch for you guys the
lightest and darkest shades just to show
the contrast first we have the lightest
shade of Kylie's concealer which is the
shade pearl then we have the latest
shade of shape tape which is fair and
then finally we have color pops latest
shade which is in the shade of fair 5
out of the three of these Kylie's is the
lightest and then we have the darker
shades and just to clarify these
swatches are not to help anybody find
their right color this is simply just to
show contrast first we have Kylie's
darkest shade which is called cocoa then
we have a heart shape tape which is in
the shade mahogany and then finally we
have color pop in the shade of wrench 75
you guys out of all these once again it
Kylie's is the darkest whoa that took a
very very long time and now that we have
all the logistics out of the way and you
guys know all the details let's go ahead
and actually put this concealer to the
test
well these computers originally on her
snapchat she said that they were
definitely lightweight and buildable
very very very natural type look so this
exactly what I'm gonna do today I am
gonna be filming it a little bit with a
very very fun friend so I do want to do
a kind of more like glam look as opposed
to something as super intense
so I'm just starting off by priming my
skin using the Mac stroke cream in the
shade like the gold one just for a very
very do we look for foundation I do be
using my Too Faced Born This Way
Foundation in the shade nude and I'm
gonna doing just a light layer of this
I'm not gonna go full intense coverage
like I normally do so I brought up my
chart shade tape in the shade light
which is one that I always use for
everyday makeup routine and by looking
at the collection I determined that my
best shade is probably gonna be gypsum
I'm just gonna go into this concealer in
place and
my normal locations starting off under
my eyes I'm also gonna pull this down my
nose bridge as always because you guys
know that I like to it snatch the nose
in comparison to save page just because
I know that that's what I use in a lot
of you guys use as well it is definitely
a lot more light weight when I put it on
it doesn't feel so like clunky but
hopefully that doesn't mean that the
coverage won't be as good let's go ahead
and blend in oh wow
okay actually blends out really really
easily damn okay Carly did not come to
play I don't know if you guys can really
tell on camera with all these lights but
obviously you guys know that I talk with
a lot of expression in my face and I
just raised my eyebrows a little bit to
set underneath my eyes and now I have
really really bad creases so hopefully
this concealer doesn't get too crazy and
when I set it with powder it'll fix
itself I'm gonna grab a lighter
concealer in the shade stone from the
collection and I'm just gonna put this
right in the inner corners underneath my
eyes just to try to build up the
coverage a little bit and brighten
because I feel like the lash eight I use
which was gypsum was a little bit too
close to my natural skin tone not even
being dramatic this actually blends out
like a dream like this is going on very
very smoothly it's not picking up any of
the foundation underneath and definitely
it's like pretty decent coverage too I
know it says light carpet on it but I
actually feel like this might be more of
a medium coverage and if it is light
it's definitely buildable because as you
guys saw when they out of that second
layer I definitely added a lot more
pigment and my under eye bags are like
literally gone and I got I think three
hours of sleep last night so this is
kind of a pressed that before we start
cruising all over I'm just going to
blend out below my eyes and then grab my
translucent powder and my Beauty Blender
and just underneath there to make sure
it is in place I'm also gonna practice
on my nose center of the forehead to
make sure I don't get any crusty
wrinkles and then just using the access
to go over the rest of my face not going
in too intense because I do want it to
be kind of doing today and not too matte
but obviously we want our makeup to say
on looking in the mirror I absolutely
love how this works so far I was able to
layer up the coverage so it looks super
super nice my under eye bags are
literally gone honestly it looks really
really flawless I'm so pleasantly
surprised
I didn't think they're gonna be bad but
I was not ready for this shave tape
maybe quaking by the end of this video
but obviously we have a lot more to go
but the one thing that I will say
and with the amount of light going on
and skin soothing filters there is no
way that you're gonna be able to see
this on camera but it is here you're
just gonna trust me on this one I
promise if you are a fellow glasses
wearer like me you know those red
circles that we get right up in here on
the nose bridge from where the glass is
set on your nose they're literally like
permanently embedded into my face I can
kind of see the circles peeking through
on both sides the concealer did not
cover them fully but then again this
does not claim to be a full coverage
concealer so it's definitely not a
deal-breaker all right guys now that my
face is all set in place and ready to go
I'm gonna go ahead and finish off my
makeup routine and then I'll be right
back to do a little check it and then
I'm gonna wear this for a few hours and
we're gonna put it to the test it looks
really great right now but who knows and
a few hours that may be creepy and gross
and completely worn off we're gonna have
to find out all right sisters it has
been about one hour now and I just
finished up my makeup like I said I was
gonna go for this light everyday look I
added some fake freckles and no lashes
and just nice and Slater brows I love
how those look turned out I feel
absolutely stunning but the point of
this video is not this look it is the
concealer like I said it has only been
one hour now but it still looks really
really bomb I did cover up my cheek
regions obviously with freckles but you
can still tell under the eyes right here
it still looks very very bright it isn't
actually creasing either which is really
really great my forehead looks fine and
my moustache region looks fine there's
no creases everything looks really
really good and I'm honestly extremely
impressed I have to have to see a few
different friends right now but I'm
gonna take you guys along with me and
we're gonna do some check-ins every few
hours to see if this concealer stays in
place all night long
okay sisters we are doing a Tati
check-in and what better person to do a
talk to you check-in Tati
so I'm wearing a new product on my face
right now I would love for you to tell
me what you think about my skin right
now okay the foundation looks really
nice I like the highlight I like the
whole like brow highlight inner corner
moment you have going on I dig that the
freckle area did you make it darker yeah
I did I put some bronzer on and some
blush on to like okay to make it look
like youthful like i was sunkissed but
thinking morse is typically about like
complex its a contested the kylie
concealers of course this is like the
hot product chocolate
I've seen better okay I don't know it
looks a little powdery were you ladies
loving it I honestly was I was a little
bit shocked because I didn't I didn't
think they're gonna be bad but I wasn't
expecting much and I was actually really
pleasantly surprised and looking at them
compared to what they looked like an
hour ago I feel like they still look
exactly the same just an hour mm-hmm
your under eyes don't look bad I think
the thing that I'm noticing is the
Sunkist thing you did is throwing off a
little bit of the brightness well I feel
like I met you I felt like after I do
that I was like oh maybe not the best
example for handle is it full coverage
or just like absolutely light coverage
but I felt like when I put it on it was
more medium coverage which I definitely
was not upset about and then I was able
to layer actually really well so it is
buildable for sure I mean I want to show
lack my face life-release I process are
taught to the entire light range of the
concealers this is pretty full coverage
yeah like this is this is actually
really nice I agreed it I'm not breaking
the rules you never really want to put
concealer on top of powder but I'm just
gonna see what happens I've been wearing
this makeup all day long that's actually
the way to do it if you really really
need a touch-up with your concealer like
put it on the back of your hand with a
sponge and then you can kind of just get
the tiniest amount I've never done that
before but I'm horrified see that does
look really good
just kind of like touched up the
situation I like it I do too I was like
and it's only twenty dollars to which I
feel like is honestly it's way deeper
than its Jami she's not it's not 360
it's not I think it's good but obviously
needs to keep writing this if they're
out the night and I will keep you guys
posted it's been two hours now I think
it still it's going up pretty strong
under eyes may look a little bit dry but
that's just good I'll keep you guys
posted alright sister I just got back
home from it very very fun night out
with friends and it's currently 11:37
p.m. at night
this means this makeup has been on for
just over eight hours now I definitely
am really ready to take this off and go
to bed but let's do our final check-in
and final thoughts so this is my face
after eight hours of wearing with
absolutely no touch-ups
I mean we can tell it's getting a little
bit crust to get this point I'm
definitely getting some creasing
around this area I'm definitely looking
a little bit oily as well but honestly I
don't hate it you guys know that I've
honestly been loving it be more natural
dewy skin really so I'm kind of living
for this like lift and makeup look but
let's discuss the actual concealer and
like the under-eye region looking in the
mirror like I said my face is a little
bit dewy an oily right now which I kind
of like but if I touch like right here
or in the 7th my forehead it definitely
feels a little bit oily but if I touch
underneath my eyes it is literally
bone-dry like I'm talking Sahara Desert
level you guys saw that when I asked how
do you a my under eyes she did say that
they looked a little bit dry to me
personally obviously I see myself with
makeup on every single day I do not see
that this might be a little bit weird to
say and definitely may comment down
below if you think otherwise but I
actually feel like my under eyes look a
little bit better than normal I feel
like the brightness is still very much
there like you can not see my under-eye
bags
peeking through at all and I feel like
the crease such level on them is a
little bit less than normal as well
aside from the aesthetic self on the
feeling level my androids do feel
ridiculously dry
I feel like 20 dollars for the amount of
product you're getting is actually a
really really fair price
especially in comparison to some of the
other high-end more popular concealers
on the market right now on Kylie's
Instagram she said that this was a light
coverage but buildable concealer and I
would agree with her on that and
definitely went on it pretty light but I
was able to layer over top of it for a
more full coverage and brightening
effect and I actually really really
loved how this looked on my under eyes
and on the rest of my face today I will
say though that this formula is pretty
drying it looked absolutely beautiful on
my skin before I said it with a lot of
powder but you guys know sister James
needs a whole lot of powder I do have a
combination to oily skin so I think that
if you have my skin type this will be
really really perfect for you because
it'll dry down a little bit and just set
really beautifully into place but I
think that if you have dry skin this may
be a no-go because it might look a
little bit crusty and dusty just like my
under eyes were a little bit close to
getting today I think that the one major
flaw with us that may defer you from
getting to concealer as the fact that
Kylie is an e-commerce brand
I know Kylie has been doing her little
kylie truck thing that like goes around
all different stops in LA a month people
try out different products which i think
is really really great obviously she
does not have any stores where you can
actually test the products and and what
I find really really weird about these
concealers is that Kylie doesn't do
returns so if you order a shade it's a
completely wrong shade you're stuck with
it and you have 20
down the drain if this is a product that
you want to check out I would definitely
recommend it doing your research
especially when it comes to your shade
range I would very much recommend
finding another beauty blogger or
influencer who has purchased that
concealers or receive them in PR that
has a similar skin tone to you and
trying to figure out what shade really
works so you can make an educated
decision just our reference for those of
you guys out there who are close to my
skin tone my two favorite foundations on
my Too Faced Born This Way it in the
shade a nude and eye makeup from her
stick in the shade of y 315 and I
usually like my concealer to be one or
two shades lighter so in shape tape I'm
in the shade of light and therefore in
the Kylie concealer I am in the shade
gypsum overall after testing out this
concealer and my makeup routine and
wearing it for eight hours straight I
think that Kylie has a winner on her
hands all right sisters it is literally
getting so late and I need to get my
beauty rest tonight I really hope you
