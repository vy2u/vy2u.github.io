to my channel this video is going to
feature a new product that just came out
recently this baby right here is the
Kylie cosmetics hi shadow palette now
everybody who's anybody in the beauty
world has been Tanja this call recently
and there been a lot of mixed reviews so
I really wanted to get my hands on it
myself
to test it out just a quick disclaimer
too because I know somebody's going to
bring it up and try to throw shade at me
when this palette did first release a
lot of people were talking on Twitter
including myself about the color choices
of the palette let's be real we've all
seen palettes before including these
colors but after kind of stepping back
and thinking about it these are the
colors that Kylie wears all the time so
it totally makes sense for her to
releases as her first palette now if you
can't get your hands on the Kylie
cosmetics palette I would generally
recommend the morphe 35o it is a chaebol
alternative and comes with more shadows
I did maybe develop my own money I'm not
a Kylie's pure list so I did not receive
this for free but spoiler alert after
times pal I actually really really like
it so Kylie if you want to hit me up
please do girl I'd be honored to work
with you and I did go ahead and order a
second palette so I can include this one
on a giveaway on Instagram so make sure
you're following me there for more
details coming soon
like I said I really wanted to purchase
his palette for myself and kind of do
our first impressions and to try with it
and see what it truly is capable of now
a lot of people have been doing a kind
of wearable glam so I really wanted to
take it one step further because y'all
know me I'm X ray up so today I decided
to do this bronze and gold cut crease
look with the palette and I really
really love how it turned out
as always all products use and coupon
codes we listed in description below and
I think that is everything so if you
want to see how I created this double
cut crease using the new Kylie cosmetics
tightline palette
make sure to keep on watching I'm going
to start off aren't cutting my face
today's my benefit Porefessional primer
as usual I'm really using a lot of this
interest warming it's my t-zone right
now my skin is the worst it has been in
months I don't know who the heck signed
off on this because I will tell you
right now I certainly do not but I'm
getting real sick of waking up every
single morning with a new pimple
which I'm not used to because my skin
used to be really great so um
sucks but we're going to make it work
and really paws on the foundation to
hide all of the teenage problems /
foundation tonight I'm going to go into
my makeup for ever ultra HD foundation
stick and why 315 like I said I'm really
using a lot of this because we want full
coverage today since my skin sucks it's
actually my second time trying to film
this video I started it last night and I
ended up stopping and taking everything
off midway through before I even got to
open at the kahshanna palette I tried to
use a different foundation in it because
I figured it maybe all go really really
full coverage since my skin's obviously
very bad right now as i factor out
literally 13 times running in the first
11 seconds of this video I'd like to
give a formal apology time ago Ultra HD
foundation stick shouldn't have cheated
for concealers today and to brighten
everything up I'm going to use my Too
Faced Born This Way concealer in light
these concealers I'm really quickly
become my new all-time favorites the
coverage and just a formula of them is
so good and like they blend out so
nicely so I really like the matte I've
been bit using them a lot lately so this
is my official announcement I guess
after using them for a few months
they're good that means anything to any
of you and I'm just going to take
another damp Beauty Blender and dip it
into my Kodi airspun powder and I'm
going to set all the areas where I tend
to get the most creasing which is going
to be under the eyes and on my forehead
I'm just going to go ahead and set the
rest my face using my makeup forever
about the finished powder using my
morphe ar0 brush this is from the new
rose gold collection and holy crowd
they're literally so freaking gorgeous
these are an absolutely to any personal
Oliver's collection and you can use
coated James for money off your purchase
to bronze today I'm going to use my
benefit hoola bronzer and my morphe r7
brush I'm going to go a little bit
hotter than normal today on the bronzer
just because this foundation is looking
a little bit light on me which is a good
thing um so how about today which means
I actually got tan the summer love going
outside
now I'm going to go ahead and bake my
face using my Cody or some powder and a
powder puff a lot of you guys have been
asking me for a nose contouring tutorial
now that I have kind of like gotten
better I promise I will do it eventually
right now I can't life a girl what's
going on with my camera and lighting
setup obviously I'm new to this but my
nose contour kind of like reflects here
here here and here
it doesn't look as good as it should on
camera so I'm sorry and I promise it
will go eventually
just be patient please while I'm baking
in the oven I'm just gonna quickly go do
my eyebrows off-camera that once I come
back we can go ahead and get started on
the eyes I just zoom you guys in a
little bit this is going to be a pretty
intricate eye so I want to make sure you
can really see what's going on so this
is my first time using the Kylie palette
or any Kylie products at all actually so
I'm very excited to see how these work
this is going to be kind of a tutorial
and a first impression so let's get
started I'm going to start off by
dusting the shade of Jasper which is the
lightest shade of the pallet over my eye
ladies my more BM 5:17 brush just to get
a light base done for the club crease my
first impressions are the honors of the
shadow is not bad at all it's pretty
pigmented for a whitish shade usually
these are pretty chalky but I'm honestly
liking how this one looks I'm going to
grab hematite on a sigma e o six liner
brush just to carve out the crease I'm
just going in really really lately and
I'm going to start to draw out the
crease wow this actually really
pigmented okay
I'm going to take tigereye on my morphe
ambit 213 and kind of buff out the line
a little bit so I get a lot of questions
on how to do cut creases forehead and
eyes obviously I do not have a lot of
space between my eye and my actual
eyebrow and my eyelid does fold in a
pretty unfortunate area which makes
doing a lot of IARC or intricate eye
looks on my eyelids not the easiest
thing in the world so my rule of thumb
is what I'm doing these cup creases is
to place your new crease line above
where your actual eyelid fold is just so
when you open your eye you don't lose
all that hard work and I'm going to take
the color citrine on a more VM 514 and
just go over that crease that we already
have just to blend everything out a
little bit when you're blending this out
trying to be as defined as possible with
it but it's totally okay if you get it
under your crease line because we are
going to go in with some concealer just
to clean it up before we do the second
half of the cup crease now going back
with hematite on my M with 213 just to
deepen I've got crease a little bit more
I'm not going back into that Sigma liner
brush and the color of Bronzite which is
the dark brown in the bottom row and I'm
going to just cut the liner then I'm
just taking humidity on my M 213 to kind
of off that line out but these concrete
looks layering is so important and it
definitely is going to take a lot of
time and a lot of patience it's taking
me forever to learn you know how to do
these remotely correctly so if you don't
get it right on the first time
definitely don't give up just keep
trying because they look so beautiful
once you kind of perfect the art of the
conch reefs now this is where it becomes
okay if you were a little bit messy to
that cut crease because I'm going to go
in with my morphe a 39 brush and a
little bit of that form this way
concealer just to clean out that line
I'm just taking John strong my M by 17
brush and setting that little bit of
concealer in place now to start the
second half of this double cut crease
I'm going to go back with that Sigma
liner brush and the shade of Bronzite to
begin carving out the second crease when
I drag that shuttle back in I'm just
following right underneath the first pup
crease line just a little bit below and
I'm going right in the crease of my eye
following all the way to the inner
corner look at this part of the eye are
taking my morphe f-14 my brush and just
filling in at the
portion of this wing and then taking
Quixote on that state of Zack brush and
blending this orange shade right in the
middle of the lid and kind of connecting
it to the dark brown so the next portion
of the I are going to be that inner
corner and glitter so I'm going to hold
off on that just for a second and clean
up this outer wing before I go in and
finish the eye I wanted to find the
upper wing just a little bit more so I'm
going back in with the Sigma liner brush
and I'm sitting in it just to darken up
a little bit now to finish off the ombre
of the lower cut crease I'm going to
spritz my morphe at 19 brush with some
makeup primer
mist and fix and I'm going to go in with
quartz on the brush on yeah okay I'm
really liking this to be a permanently
honest of you guys the only thing I
would say is this particular shade court
is not as metallic as I was hoping it to
be but everything else honestly is very
very pigmented and blends out pretty
nicely so I'm genuinely and pleasantly
surprised now you can totally leave the
eye just like this obviously adding a
lower lash line and lashes which we're
going to do in a short second but I want
to add a little bit more of a pump and a
little bit of glitter I'm going to start
off by adding makeup addiction cosmetics
enchanted pigment right on that inner
corner if you don't have this pigment
but you're a big fan of Kylie and if you
bought the birthday Collection it did
come with cream shadows which I've been
hearing nothing but amazing things about
so you could totally pop on the cover
creme shadow shade inside of this
pigment once again you could totally
stop here but you know me and I love to
be extra as hell so I'm just going to
finish this off by going into the makeup
forever diamond powder in 9 101 6 which
is literally just gold and pop it right
into the inner corner I just went ahead
and quickly line my upper and lower
waterline using my morphe m-2 50.0 liner
brush and the gel liner in Slate sort of
my lower lash line I'm just going to
take my m5 14 brush and citrine and
despot this along the lash line and this
color is kind of our lower transition
shade I'm not taking up sitting and
hematite on Miami 213 brush and bumping
that into the lash line and then I'm
also making sure to connect the upper
wing from the caught crazy
to the lower lashline I'm seeing a
little bit of bronzing and kind of
reshaping the lower half of this
weighing it I drew the line originally
to the corner of my eye but I'm not
going to reshape a little bit and drag
it below that just so it looks more
fluid with the lower lash line and then
going back into the m56 too and blending
it out and then lastly I was taking a
little bit of a sitting on just the
outer corner of the eye and buffing that
into the waterline it just make sure
everything is really seamless and
there's no skin showing between my lower
lashline and the waterline to prep our
lashes I'm just going to curl my natural
ones
then just wetting into the my
ride-or-die benefit roller lash as
always for lashes today I'm just going
to pop on these lashes from makeup shock
in the style girls night out and not
complete this eye look I'm going to go
ahead and do the other one
off-camera quickly and then come back
and we can finish the face and the lips
together for highlighter today I'm gonna
be using my Anasazi is so Hollywood
located my morphe add a 501 brush for my
lips today I'm going to go in first with
over liquid lipstick in the shade at
Pasadena this is one of my all-time
faves I love the formula and you can use
code Jake Charles for 30% off this lip
is looking a little bit too pinky right
now so I'm going to go in with dohsa
colors sand and just make a little ombre
on in the center then to finish off I'm
just going to top the lips with jus a
lip gloss and it's skinny dip and there
we go that completes as bronze and gold
