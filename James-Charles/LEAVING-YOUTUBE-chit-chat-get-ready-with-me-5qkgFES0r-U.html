welcome back to my youtube channel
cutting straight to the point I'm going
to a very very fun event tonight and I
have a lot that I want to talk to you
guys about I feel like we haven't sat
down and really done the chit chat
already to me for a very very long time
I mean my clothing line lunch and I am
so excited to see all of you guys
rocking all the sisters hoodies and then
my music came out lastly can the
acapella group you guys were so excited
about it and I am so excited about it
and there are so many more fun covers
coming soon I also took a little bit of
a break and had a little bit of a
breakdown on Twitter a few weeks ago as
well which I definitely want to talk
about so yeah one little thing I forgot
to mention before this chitchat with me
get started this video is sponsored by
covergirl so thank you so much to them
don't forget to watch until the very end
to see me try out their brand-new I'm
melting pout lipsticks and yeah without
further ado grab your popcorn Geiger
Pinkett Eve Jenkins because this is
going to be a long one and let's get
glam so I'm obviously starting off with
my base already done I went ahead and
did my foundation at concealer of brows
and contour and powdered everything
off-camera same exact routine that I use
every single time so let's just go in
with the eyes for today's eye shadow
look we're gonna be using two very very
unique palettes that I never use on my
channel being the morphe 35o and the
morphe 35o palette I want to create like
a sunset I look so I'm gonna start off
by guarding my m4 for one brush and dip
into this late transition oMG shade
right here and put it in the crease
while I'm doing my eyes I do definitely
wanna talk about the negative with you
guys before we get into the fun and
positive things for the remainder and
majority of this video but I do just
want to address this and that is kind of
why I took a little bit of a break from
YouTube and social media for a few days
and also why I've been a little bit down
in the dumps when it comes to like
Twitter and filming lately I feel like a
lot of social media influencers just
live their lives and our lives look so
crazy and fun to you guys on the outside
but on the inside there's a lot of stuff
that goes on behind the scenes and a lot
of emotions behind it and I feel like a
lot of people don't like to talk about
that and I definitely happen to talk
about that a lot I'm next intagram IM
433 and dip into this warm tone orange
shade away over here I would definitely
talk to you guys about how I was feeling
and sometimes being a social media
influence or having an online
personality is really really hard
and I'm not talking about on a physical
level because let's be real we literally
sit in front of a camera and make
freakin makeup tutorials in our
underwear for a living so I definitely
am NOT talking about on a physical level
but on an emotional level is where this
job can be sometimes really really
really stressful and super overwhelming
I'm next we have another clean M for
three three and dip into the Mac blush
in the shade sketch simply because I
don't have a good maroon eyeshadow that
I really like I know when it comes to a
lot of social media influencers
including myself a lot of us like to
pretend that hate comments don't get to
us I mean you always see us doing like
reading hate home videos or posting hate
tweets on Twitter just to give like a
good laugh for you guys but honestly at
the end of the day I don't care what
anybody says one thousands and thousands
and thousands I hate comments are coming
in eventually they're gonna start to get
to you and is sometimes really really
hard to focus on the positive when there
is so much negativity on the internet
let's be real I've definitely made a lot
of mistakes in the past that I am NOT
proud of but I've apologized and own up
to every single one of them which i
think is really really vital in order to
grow and become a better person but
let's also be real and saying that I
definitely am an easy target for the
internet to pick on in laughi at the end
of the day a lot of people said that
hate comments don't get to them
including myself I really try hard and
not let hate give to me I'm just to
focus on the positivity because there is
so much positivity with you guys but
when you do start to receive at
thousands and thousands of hate comments
I'm like a video or a tweet that you
posed it really can put a lot of
pressure on you and make you start to
question your morals and why are doing
what you do and for me if that happens
relatively often have you been following
me on snap or Twitter for a while you
would know that there was a time about
two weeks ago where I had a little bit
of a breakdown on snapchat video I was
filming and I did actually end up taking
a break from social media completely for
a few days because everything just got
really really overwhelming and I want
you guys to know that it's okay I'm next
undergo that same m-43 3 and dip into at
these two purple shades right here and
use that to deepen up the crease when I
talk about this openly with you guys I
don't want you to think I'm complaining
or ungrateful in any way shape or form
because butt isn't the case at all in
fact what I tweeted that I needed a few
days to take a mental break I got so
many amazing messages from all of you
guys that completely understood where I
was coming from which meant the entire
world to me I also got a lot of tweets
and messages saying oh my god you're 18
years old living in the middle of LA
like I said I am so thankful to be
living a very very kind life thanks to
you guys but at the end of the day there
is no amount of money that can buy
happiness
trust me on this one and unfortunately
with this job often comes a lot of
pressure like I said and a lot of
responsibility and a lot of negativity
as well so sometimes that happiness can
be really really hard to find no matter
how much money is in your bank account
no matter how many cool opportunities
you're having it no matter what car you
drive where you're living
happiness comes from within and
sometimes no matter who you are what
you're doing what your job is you need
to take a mental break because mental
health is so so so so so important and
definitely needs to come before any type
of post on social media I don't want to
sound like I'm complaining or ungrateful
in any way shape or form there are so
many more important and awful things to
me on the world right now that make my
issues literally non-existent but I do
just want to have an open conversation
with you guys about this because I know
it's something that not a lot of
influences address but I definitely do
and I know a lot of you guys do look up
to me as well not only for makeup but
also for life advice which means
literally the entire world to me and I
do try best to be a good role model
obviously of course we're gonna fail
sometimes but if you were like me a few
weeks ago and you do get in a rut or
you're not feeling creative or inspired
take a few days off do it everyday to do
to get your heart back in the game
mental health is so important so
sometimes taking a break us totally okay
and I definitely wanted to share that
message with you guys I know it's what a
lot of people were wondering whether or
not I was gonna quit YouTube and
obviously hello I am here I don't plan
on leaving anytime soon I have a lot of
really really good content coming out
and a lot of products that I'm working
on that I am literally so excited for
you guys to see but like I said it
definitely needed a few days off but
sister is back and ready to go so now
that we have up all the negative out of
the way thank God we can focus on the
positive but before we get into that I'm
gonna grab some more shave tape in the
shade lights and and just put a little
bit on the back of my hand and grabbing
my way to go morphe and a four-to-one
brush I'm gonna cut the crease and then
quickly keeping my head tilted back so
it doesn't crease I'm gonna grab my M 4
to 5 brush and dip into my Kodi Ariston
powder and then set that concealer in
place and then without saying M 45 brush
I'm just gonna dip into this light bone
color shade up in here and just set that
in place for once I'm actually gonna
keep this eye look fully matte aside
from the Bravo and Charlie of course but
I really it's been a long time since
I've done a matte crease I usually end
up doing some type of a
shimmer on the lid but I'm kind of
getting tired of that right now so why
don't do a little bit of a matte sunset
look okay so onto a more positive note
while I clean up this cut crease please
but so many fun things have been
happening lately and I'm so excited that
you guys are finally getting to see them
if you saw last week my clothing line
sister's apparel finally dropped and you
guys went crazy I think we literally
sold almost 2,000 hoodies in under 24
hours which is literally so insane I
cannot wait for you guys to all get your
sister's hoodies so you can take me your
little pictures and your flashback
Mary's oh my god I just came out wait
I've been working on searches apparel
for literally so long and I'm just so
excited that you guys are equally as
excited as I am and I also have a lot of
fun designs planned for the future as
well and a lot of things that are being
manufactured that are a lot more
complicated than just hoodies and hats
so definitely keep your eyes peeled
because I big big plans for sisters
apparel also if you guys saw my aqua
color group flashback release our first
ever cover this past Friday on my
youtube channel and I cannot even thank
you guys enough for the positive
response we got so many of you guys
absolutely love the song and we were so
so so nervous but also excited to put it
out music obviously is a huge huge
aspect of our life that you guys really
do not get to see much up until recently
on my youtube channel but I'm very very
excited that I get to share that with
you guys now and we have so many
exciting covers coming soon on flash
life that you guys are going to love
this is just very very exciting for me
because I've been singing with my best
friend Anthony who's actually in the
crew many of you guys know him since
lily we were in third grade and we've
been trying to put together an acapella
group literally like almost 10 years now
so we are so excited that we finally
have a really good at group of solid and
super super talented kids that all share
the same love for music so definitely
keep your eyes peeled for future flash
project because it is definitely a group
you're going to want to watch trust me
I'm not why I think this look definitely
need a little bit of a wing so I'm gonna
grab my Kat Von D tattoo liner in the
shade trooper and just sketch out a
sharp pass wing ready to cut somebody
that is definitely a large in the charge
wing but honestly I am kind of living
for it I'm gonna get my e43 brush from
morphe and then a little bit more shape
tape and just clean up the shadow below
the wing
I'm next area by NYX wonder pencil in
the shade of light and just put that in
my waterline same exact thing with the
upper that I'm gonna first start off
with my m4 for one and a bright orange
shade and disco really really lightly
underneath the eye to create a
transition shade I'm also not bringing
the shade fully to the inner corner
either because I do like to when I do
these paper I looks cut out that inner
corner so it makes my eyes look a little
bit bigger and wider I'll show you guys
in a second I'm next I'm gonna have an M
at 213 and dip into that dark purple
shade from the 35b and connect the
winged liner and use this to hug the
lash line when I have this brush my hand
with the purple when I get to the inner
corner I'm going to really really
lightly pull that forward as opposed to
following my natural eye shape and going
up I'm just creating kind of a second
little crease up in here and then I'm
gonna clean that up with concealer in
this area this is very similar to drag
makeup which just makes my eyes look a
little bit bigger then once again we're
gonna grab my m151 and dip into the Mac
blush and the shade is sketch to blend
together that orange and purple alright
so that is what I all complete and that
was definitely a very very lengthy
process and turned out a lot more
intense than I was planning on but I
really really like this look so far so
I'm gonna go interview the one off
camera quickly and I'll be right back to
finish off the rest of the eyes and the
rest of the face alright so that is the
other eye all complete this is
definitely a lot more intense of a look
than I was originally expecting or going
for but I'm honestly it kind of loving
for it or kind of living for it oh my
god four lashes today I've gotta go to
the Lilly lush in the style aleena these
lashes are so so so beautiful they're
like very very good because they're big
on the outside but tiny on the inside I
definitely like these a lot
what I'm doing this I make sure to get
super close up to the root of the lash
right up in at that upper waterline just
because I don't ever do it black in the
upper waterline anymore because it
always makes me super uncomfortable to
wear throughout the day I always find
myself picking at my lashes and my
waterline because it always ends up
transferring and it just makes my eyes
feel really really bad so I stopped
doing that and it's made my life I don't
see a million times easier but now when
I do mascara I have to really make sure
it's black up in that region so it
doesn't look really really done when I'm
looking forward like this sensor is a
sunset look I definitely have a very
golden sun kissed highlight going on so
of course I'm gonna grab my Anasazi
estelle Hollywood illuminator and mix it
with my mary-lou manizer from the balm
and I also
gonna include a little bit of this ink
lot pigment in the shade 7 of course got
a highlight above the brow bone as well
this is what my all-time favorite makeup
tricks and they get a lot of questions
about this too and the why I do this and
it is because when you take photos from
either the side it gives you that nice
like glow like right there but also I
personally like it because when I take
photos front on it reflects obviously
here and here which makes my face look
wider and I like my face to look really
really wide and chisel because of my jaw
line I do have a very very long face so
I like to kind of slim it down just the
slightest bit and this trick really
really helps and to make sure my
highlight and contour are nice and
blended together I'm gonna grab the Mac
blush in the shade up pinch me and my
morphe morphe my morphe for bronze
alright so for the lipid ii doodahs
today i'm going to using a brand new
product for my sister's over at
covergirl and those are the melting pout
lipsticks they come in these cute little
squeeze tubes and there are a ton of
different shades I just picked out four
that I think might match I'm gonna do a
little bit of a swatch just do you want
to look good on the actual lips
I feel like this nude shade number 105
is a little bit too pinky for this look
um let's test number one forty this
definitely could be really really pretty
honestly I think number 135 is a little
bit too much of a blue tone shade purple
for this look so that one's gonna be a
now and then number 150 Oh number 150
looks really good I definitely think I
want to go into the shade number 150 but
before I do that I'm gonna grab the
covergirl farewell feathering liner this
is also a new product and it's basically
a lip liner but it's invisible and it
goes on and it stops here at liquid
lipsticks or any lipsticks from moving
around which is so so great then I'm
gonna go ahead and apply shade number
150 oh yeah okay so I actually really
really like how this lip turned out it
went on super super smooth as you can
see it is obviously a liquid lipstick
formula but it didn't write out on a
percent matte which I don't mind as well
it is a dark ready cranberry shade which
is usually a red flag when it comes to
lipsticks because they usually are very
very patchy but with this the formula
actually looks really really consistent
so these are definite winds for me as
well the lip liner is great as you can
see my lip line is super smooth and
strong so I love it okay so finally to
finish off this look I'm gonna grab my
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray
and give my
they say quick little spritz alright
guys so that is this sunset cranberry
look I'll complete this definitely got a
lot more dark intense and vampy than I
originally anticipated I was going for a
little bit of a lighter eye at first but
I actually really really like how this
came out as well I guess follows like
relatively soon I mean like I'm ready
for spooky times and ready for pumpkins
Halloween you name it so I guess we're
just jumping the gun a little bit but
who cares I like this look as well I
really hope you guys enjoyed just
sitting down and chatting with me I felt
like I had a lot that I wanted to get
