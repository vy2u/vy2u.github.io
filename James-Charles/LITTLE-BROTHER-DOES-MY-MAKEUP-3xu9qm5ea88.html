back to my youtube channel so you can
see I have a very very special guest
with me here tonight me and my little
brother he's here so I mom and my little
brother are out here visiting California
for the first time ever they've actually
never seen my apartment nervous out here
before how do you feel though be in
California for four days it's
interesting
I'm so glad so like instead it is
definitely better an interesting week so
far we've been having a ton of fun which
is why I do not upload a video last
Wednesday I apologize having good family
time because I have not seen them in and
very very large
I have not submitted a very very long
time so I definitely wanted to see them
and I actually flew Ian and my mom out
here on one condition and that is as
what I film videos with you yes I love
being a marketing genius so for today's
video I grab sister Ian and we lydian
know sister for today's videos like I
said I grab sister en and we sat down
today because it is clearly a hardcore
brawl he plays basketball and football
thank you and video games and all sorts
of brawl things and I thought I'd make
up for a living so that should show you
where we are in our relationship I want
to give you a little bit of a challenge
today and we are stand down in my studio
with a whole lot of makeup all around
the world and ian is going to be
challenged with putting a full face of
makeup on me so do you know anything
about makeup at all no I do not hey why
is your instantly have you have to watch
all my videos no like they would say
family is your number one Supporter so
without further ado if you would like to
see my little brother try to put a full
glam face of makeup on me a professional
makeup artist ready for this I don't
know you really haven't watched on my
video so far your piece of SIA keep on
watching there you go alright so we're
gonna switch into vlog phone temporarily
I'm on my iPhone because sister en it
needs a good sister needs to pick up my
makeup so we're gonna wear for this
video I don't have a single product in
front of me but over there we have a
full wall
make up products let's go so I make up
room is currently completely under
construction right now but we do have
both of the acrylic drawers set up a
shout out to dirty perkins for that
decoration and organization information
but let's get picking in I'll give you
to him see that basically you're going
to want to probably counseling from
every single drawer this is why ya know
what foundation is that born this way to
face alright I'm good choice no yeah
sure anti age mr. Christy how I get this
this is setting spray out oh yeah
there's an urban decay chill Thank You
Steph she's a good one again you're
actually doing a pretty awesome
heart-shaped tape blur stick sounds cool
what kind of look are you going for
today do I don't know putting makeup on
your face well I mean thought you wanted
to look good what is it sure I don't
know
oh highlighting powder what I thought
that was look Geoffrey star because he's
popular I think I got some balls in here
James's favorite oh excuse me doing an
ugly color wait Ian open it up open to a
beautiful tea I have I think this one
underneath it ready you know what that
is
sister dangerous picked out all of this
makeup products and I swear to God I
actually gave him no help at all
and he actually managed to pick out a
lot of parts that he used on an everyday
basis so I'm thinking he actually may be
a sister of himself a James child video
watcher and I think he's lying but let's
go ahead and get started you know what
you're gonna do first
um no Christie no no no no Leslie like
work
is it oh excuse me it doesn't work read
the directions there's something that
doesn't have any reactions I guess
doesn't work
 dish yeah perfect
click anymore probably so while Ian uses
several several several pumps my
foundation on this beauty blender I
figured you guys asking for some
questions
comedian can answer to throughout the
process of this video so without further
ado let's get started
oh my god you already put foundation on
the area we go under process excuse me
pimples your face - and you have 50
pimples all over your face don't ever
just something like that ever again how
do you look I don't - look I want you to
be the now I hear the our struggle
online yeah and Brooks out of what were
your first thoughts when Jane started
wearing makeup I don't know how I felt
about it I was kind of scared
uh-huh then you started making money and
going places so I accepted it okay your
foundation is done okay till attacks
good shape tape it's got that what is
this oh this is the why should I map it
I must tell you anything that Oh God

James's most annoying how that always
thinking he's Freud no matter what
that's because I am oh yeah oh oh yeah
look at that
she loved a chiseled contour anything
other you put on your face what do you
mean everything wrong with them like
your like your cheeks and not like
your eyes and Cather's a few more things

heart desires that to go on oh oh oh my
god the Beautyblender can't fix
everything
Alma's they really can't and busting
what thing makes you the proudest of
your brother but where do you see him in
ten years
the fact that he's successful with his
job but he's enjoying it
Oh what do you see me doing a ten-year
loss why we make up okay stop Ian oh hey
hey maybe daddy asked as you two get
along when you were little
no what about now well this question is
just from you from a sister Jack he said
have you ever been bullied for having a
famous gay brother do people like you
more because of it love you both sisters
it depends like my friends accept it and
like I don't know when there's like kids
that it's like say to me about you
but I don't say anything back Christian
- is he single yeah T Serena said what
is your best memory of each other oh boy
um now let's go with dog Li green if
you're admitting that it's ugly why are
you putting it on cause you look ugly
with it Caroline said what's the
Laughing that you thought about selling
this video Jake asked who is the worst
troublemaker as you guys know I'm very
much like a rule follower like as you
guys know I very much like follow the
rules and try hard to like say and line
Eitan was very much the opposite so you
definitely got in trouble more often I
just broke your eyeliner yeah you picked
that color of all colors awesome
so um Kelly asked what's it like to have
a famous older sibling do you ever feel
like you're living in his shadow oh I
guess sure - kind of fun kind of
annoying same time why 15 I haven't done
anything with my life near 18 he's

Mary asked what was it like oh my butt
was it like when James moved to LA and
be honest do you ever miss him
no okay I get his room so you don't miss
me at all sometimes oh my god I had it
press how did James tell you that he was
gay I could kind of tell ya I don't
think I did
however we were on the trampoline one
day and you had like called me gay like
trying to like be an asshole and I just
was like so and I look kinda like it I
don't know
oh shoot yeah it's like sure yeah and
it's like literally perfectly on there

about your job today on me
Oh your lips look a little strange the
wings look a little no no not wingy the
foundation honestly does not look bad
