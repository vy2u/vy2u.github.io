welcome back to my youtube channel today
as you can see I'm done with my favorite
person in the entire world if you dose
off a few weeks ago my entire family is
out here visiting me at La and I film
videos with my parents which was so much
fun
if you guys missed those videos we
should go click right up here because
they are a very very good time but
sister ADA's back
we flew men and today's video we were
doing something very very exciting here
in YouTube there's been a very popular
trend going on right now where people
try to follow other people's makeup
tutorials that have no makeup knowledge
and what better person to try to follow
a beauty gurus makeup tutorial then
sister Ian who has no makeup knowledge
so a opposite does not wear makeup ever
but we have them three videos together
on my channel at this point so how do
you think you're gonna perform today
wonderful and professional now oh he's a
professional anyway coming for the gag
yeah okay this is some high confidence
levels that I did not expect for today's
video but you know what we're gonna roll
with this I love this version of sister
Ian so without further ado I'm gonna
step out ian has my tutorial ready to go
trying to follow he's gonna recreate my
lips today and good luck alright I'm
gonna be doing a white glam today so me
watching Gina's earlier from two weeks
ago how to get perfect skin
feel very moist these are the Too Faced
Born This Way in the color warm nude
just feels like peanut butter like I
said before pretty cold and we're gonna
put all over my face
hopefully it comes out decently James
always says don't miss the neck or you
get some flashback Mary situations I'm
not trying to have that so because we're
gonna do the neck we're gonna do my ears
apparently that's part of your face
makeup my ears forever alright now that
I have all my foundation done I'm gonna
continue the video and see what the next
step is I already get our concealer and
put under our eyes because that's what
James is doing these good makeup fashion
the shave new concealer so my all-time
favorites because it's Kate apparently
will cover our whole face with a hold on
Wow I feel beautiful put up loads up
beautifully
how's it very very hydrating to have a
formula to it absolutely love all right
we get the booty blunder and we're gonna
blend this all win this thing is things
to go it does everything
the beforee 20 blender my undereyes to
get rid of the crease thing is I'm gonna
have my setting powder not they're ready
my personal favorite is actually a
mixture of the laura mercier okay making
mixing zone arrange the sign just take
all right I'm gonna use the Beauty
Blender and push those creases up and
try not to be too harsh ever learned
today and truly likes bridge Oh get the
mac fix+
drop and pick up the fan we're gonna
spray myself with this morphe m/45 brush
and i too many steps i came and found
the brush the m-52 seven brush but i
guess that works
contour my cheekbones or something like
that or bronze my cheekbones i think
it's called i'm using the morphe m 405
brush use co james for 10% off we're
also gonna be using the Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit the light to
medium I'm gonna grab the palette I'm
gonna dip it into this I will do two
lines on top of my nose
Marilyn if you're so like me you're
trying to kind of fool the audio thank
you that your nose looks a lot smaller
you definitely want to follow your nose
all right we're gonna move on so I just
really like this layer of glow to kind
of reinforce it later on while the face
is still really really fresh and kind of
Dewey because it just makes everything
look we knew the nose Hollow
because if you put the it's gonna
completely ruin the effect of the
pinched nose but if you put it just on
these tiniest tip of the nose Rachael
right in between those two contour lines
it's really gonna further if you lose it
and make it look like there's no spread
just literally like Wow moving on finish
off her face we're going to lightly bake
our face but because we make our face
man once again using my damp Beauty
Blender and dipping into them right on
the sides of my nose to enforce the
highlights which once again further the
illusion of a pinched and snatched nose
and when I wipe this mall in a little
while it's gonna kind of brighten up
that entire area and just clean up the
contour what just makes it look a little
bit more defined in a little bit more
cut and finished I got a white beer to
grow and me only being 60 and I could
really grow a full beer so
hope the Singh was browser not twins
they're sisters wait a second why is
this bra pencil pink I'm gonna hold my
pencil vertically into my face and I'm
gonna use a very very light pressure and
just lightly place my pencil and just
kind of flick it upwards to create
natural-looking hair strokes all right I
think this eyeball looks okay I'm gonna
be a lazy piece like James and do the
old one off camera I'll be right back
all right I gotta find a brush I really
I'm gonna get some concealer some shape
tape concealer get a little bit on with
that brush and then I'm just gonna go
right in and start cleaning up that brow
very very carefully all right I think I
did my concealer pretty well moving on
mushroom close one eye and open
the other so I'm not sure I'm gonna do
this part
you know another guys really easy access
to eyelashes I'm gonna start by bringing
this one in it's starting right at the
root of the lash almost in my upper
waterline and just wiggling oh boy
I need a focus hold on
well we have to fix this somehow I'm
gonna see if I could fix my mistake and
we need some concealer and some setting
powder do you wear this mascara
this isn't good before you may have
worse
I'm gonna get some setting powder see if
I can fix it not sure if I can I don't
want drama we are using the LM a new boo
soo using the new bouncing Bella BAE
lashes this is gonna be the worst part
of the whole video because I want to
stab my own eyes third off fake
eyelashes shame there's like 34 ads on
this video I'm pretty sure you can
afford some lashes trap I think I think
James already cut these for me I don't
trust myself with a pair of scissors
where I did James's makeup he said I put
his lashes on perfectly but I'm not too
sure how long we better do mine I'm
gonna glue my lashes see how this works
out this dries pretty quickly and it
goes on blue so once it turns clear you
know it's ready to apply and I'm gonna
place the lash on top of my lid from no
hope
yes I don't know how I did that but I
think it's on I got a dude the other one
now which is not gonna work out - I can
already guess alright I had the glue pot
in the / I'm gonna see if I can get to
try a little bit I'm gonna tell my
little Lashon
wonderful
alright I guess I actually did it I'm a
makeup genius I saw the few tips and
tricks to show you guys to make your
lips look more plump just the thing
well the first look I'm here for you
guys today is slightly over lining your
lips 1 over linear lips I always like to
start a thing Cupid's bow just kind of
build down the list a - people always
name on there over lining is that they
keep over lining the entire top lip all
right I would get one that's the
lipstick right in the center of your
lips and make you shut up blend together
the lipstick with the lip liner for that
natural ombre look now we're doing that
again think I forgot to wipe off the
bake so I'm gonna do that now alright
James I think I'm done yeah come on and
see close your eyes low open your eyes -
you've gotta be kidding me what is going
on right now
