welcome back to my youtube channel for
today today I have something a little
bit different and very very fun plan
that I'm actually so excited for this
morning I got up at the crack of dawn I
arose for my beauty sleep with a rude
alarm awakening but I went to the Grove
here in Los Angeles and waited in line
to get this the brand new iPhone acts in
case you missed an apple just released
two brand new iPhones beating iPhone 8
and the iPhone X I guess they skipped
the iPhone 9 because two seven eight
nine huh anyway regardless the iPhone
ACTU the iPhone 10 is the brand-new
anniversary I have one edition and there
are a lot of brand new features to this
phone that have never been on an iPhone
before one of the main ones being that
the way to unlock this as you can see
there was no home button is a facial
recognition unlock feature there's been
a lot of different conspiracies about
this some people think it's really
really dope some people think that Apple
is gathering a facial recognition
software to give to the government I
don't even know what the hell is going
on but this thing is supposed to open up
when I show my face to it and it's
supposed to be really really accurate
you guys know that my job is that makeup
artist so most days also enough like
this but a lot of times after a good
long glam session I'll end up with a
even skin tone very very contoured
shakes a little bit I mean lower and
hairline with the face tuned tool a good
highlight on the cheekbones different
eyebrows sometimes we have crazy ass
lashes on and sometimes even a wig if
it's a toggle as well so I'm definitely
very into the art of transforming and
pulling out different looks so for
today's video we are gonna be using the
brand new iPhone X and we're gonna be
applying a whole lot of makeup today and
seeing how much makeup can really unpack
the iPhone X to the point where it won't
recognize my face anymore without
further ado let's start getting glam and
transform as much as possible to see if
the iPhone will still unlock once I glam
session is complete also make sure you
stay tuned until the very end of this
video for to a very very special
announcements
so before we actually apply any makeup
today I'm actually gonna go ahead and
set up the facial recognition software
so I'm gonna go into my settings on my
brand new iPhone and go into the face ID
and passcode I'm gonna turn on use face
ad for iPhone unlock and I guess I'm
going to have to set up my face ID so of
course I'm going to start this off by
using my bare face whoa
this lady makes my face look so bad face
ad is messed up I guess it was literally
that easy so let's hit done and just to
touch this out let's go ahead and lock
the phone and if I open it up hello
so I guess I see when you put your face
up to the phone it would automatically
open but that is not the case as you can
see there's a lock icon at the top and
when I put my face in front of it it
recognizes me and then it turns to an
open lock and then I can swipe up hello
and now the phone is open this is
complicated
jessa test is how I have sister Anthony
here with me as you can see the phone is
locked right now come on down I need you
to hold this up and test it to your face
and see if the thing changes to unlocked
No okay thank you so much we love
technology Hey so now we know that this
whole face ID thing works for now while
I have no makeup on let's go ahead and
put on a full face of Graham transform
ourselves and try again at the end and
see if this thing it still works I'm
first gonna shot up by applying my
makeup from from Ultra HD foundation SiC
don't forget to blend on the neck of
course and then I'm gonna grab a beauty
blender and blend this all in so based
on apples information face ID works on
your facial structure so I guess it's
supposed to measure the depth of your
face so even though we're gonna be
contouring a lot today it really Chezza
ourselves out and try to fool the camera
I'm sure that the technology may be
advanced enough to actually like do
measurements I'm really not sure how
this stuff works even though it says it
does measures distance I'm sure it does
measure things as well such as like eye
color and skin color obviously the goal
with your foundation is to get your skin
cloud to be as accurate as possible to
your normal skin color but for people
like me and my face is definitely a lot
more red than the rest of my body I do
have a lot of pimples and a lot of
rosacea as well so skin color may affect
as well foundation is all apply it I'm
gonna grab my phone and I'm gonna test
this one out still on lock's I'm not
gonna get my shake tape concealer in the
shade light sand and just highlight my
face I'm gonna make sure to make my
highlights and contours very very very
intense today to try my best to fool the
system I'm actually gonna take the Kat
Von D whiteout concealer as well
obviously this is in
show you white and I'm gonna play those
to the very high points of my face just
to once again intensify those highlights
this for the hell of that I'm gonna go
ahead and also try this wall the stuff
is on my face unblended still works once
again just gonna blend it out using a
and damping Beauty Blender oh oh oops
I'm still work I'm gonna take my sponge
into a little bit of Laura Mercier trans
is a setting powder to set my face in
place so it doesn't move around so now
that my face is all set in place I'm
going to use the Kat Von D shade and
light palette and I'm going to contour
the crap out of my face using my morphe
M 405 brush you guys know you can use
coded change for ten percent off for a
few products and I'm really gonna go in
intense with this I'm gonna use and mix
up the middle and right hand shades
obviously I would never instruct on
doing a contour this straw I mean if you
really want to chill yourself out like I
don't blame you girl but I usually go
more soft contour but today we're trying
to create a completely false facial
structure here let's see if we can
really define these cheeks
I'm gonna use this contour brush and
kind of pull it down slightly right in
this region as well to create the
illusion of a more sunken in cheekbone
to see if that will flow as well of
course we have to contour the hell out
of the forehead but let's be real I do
this in all my looks regardless so does
a normal step for me then of course
we're gonna contour our jaw lines and
make sure that the Dolan twins aren't
quaking I'm gonna contour my nose as
well using a really really dark powder
on a fluffy blending brush oh my that
looks the worst we're gonna grab a
lighter powder that's really close to my
skin tone and put this on the sides my
nose to really enhance the look of the
pinch okay so my faces a little bit just
lit out if I do say so myself obviously
this is not what my normal makeup looks
like I promise if you're new to the
sisterhood please check out some of my
other videos my makeup usually looks a
lot better than this or at least I hope
it does but let's go ahead and try this
out
it's still unlocks oh my god I'm gonna
take a powder puff and we're going to
bake the highlights of my face to really
intensify this even more gonna go right
up against the line of the nose contour
okay I'm a little bit stuck right now I
really thought this is gonna not work a
whole lot sooner than it already is
and I'm not realizing that I'm gonna
have to probably go a lot farther into
my makeup routine then anticipated so
die of the mood to do that right now but
guys we have to figure this out well my
face is baking in the oven I'm gonna go
to my benefit purse I see my eyebrow
pencil in the shade at number four and
to find out my eyebrows who knows if
it's not my freakin facial shape maybe
my eyebrows will fool that
oh you know what while we're at it let's
go ahead and try out the brand-new
camera on this too because it's
apparently sposed to be really oh my god
I'm scared my pores oh this is like
scary good quality okay let's put them
try to use this as an actual mirror oh
you're kidding
okay this idea was cancelled alright
let's go ahead and see if brows the fact
this at this point I'm starting to lose
my hope here No Oh virtually for this
video I honestly do not have high hopes
for this I thought I was gonna be able
to pull this really easily I was good
anyway I really make a routine for you
guys but clearly this is not working out
as well as I had planned so instead of
doing my normal Lily lashes miami's I
let her go down my 301 which is you guys
know if you are drag fans that these are
the classic drag lashes they are huge
they're very very long and they're gonna
take out my entire eye but maybe it'll
look like a different person
okay so this is definitely not the look
I had intended on going for today but I
guess you got to do what you got to do
so would these lashes applied let's go
ahead and blend them together with some
mascara I'm going to mix together my
real lashes with the fake ones make this
look as real as possible just right the
fact that I have literal spiders glued
onto my eyes right now and we're going
to test this thing out okay iPhone locks
and this we are really not sure what I
can do to make this not work I guess I'm
just going to wipe off my bake here and
then apply a crazy-ass lip and some
highlighter and if that doesn't work
we're gonna have to take some drastic
measures here I'm next in attempt by
make up forever pigment in the shade
number 13 this is probably the most
blinding highlighter that is in my
collection it is the most pigmented and
is so so so bright when I do use this I
only use the slightest bit I'm gonna pry
this using my more of um a 501 brush you
see what I'm talking about here to the
high points of my face
so since none of this worked the last
step in my makeup routine is always
gonna be the lipid eave doodahs for over
today's like I'm gonna use the Anasazi
liquid lipstick in the shade of paint
and I'm going to go a little bit crazy
with the over lining
laughs injections never heard of her
let's try this you're kidding
you've got this is God to be a joke how
I'm out of makeup tips let's go ahead
and try a little bit harder here phone
oh my god I am so shocked right now
this is not what I wanted I thought this
video is gonna take me five minutes to
film I really thought my ass was gonna
have Apple quaking as soon as I got like
the nose contour I'm annoyed because not
only did I have to put on makeup for the
seven times today now I look really
stupid and I have places to go after
this so at this point I'm a little
stumped clearly the crazy makeup did not
work like I wanted it to the wigs did
not work like I wanted them to so my
last and final step today is gonna be to
try out a photo of myself no Apple seems
the photos do not work you have to be
like alive and breathing for the phone
to recognize you which is great
considering my job this ability to post
photos myself online so thank God if my
phone gets stolen at least on all that a
photo can open it up but let's go ahead
and try out and see the real tape all
right so this is my most recent
Instagram photo I just posted this
earlier on today if you are true sister
go give it a double tap and if you're
not following me on Instagram you should
totally do that for a cute very face to
him selfies every once in a while I
promise it is a very very good time come
on shameless self-promotion but I'm
gonna take this photo on Anthony's phone
and my new iPhone X and then hold them
right up in front of each other and see
if this works
hello
she's not working Mary Wow that's that
after an hour of making myself look
absolutely ridiculous all I needed to do
was hold up a photo of myself in front
of it it probably knows that it was
facetune Brigades and that's all I have
for this videos today clearly this did
not exactly go as I had planned
honestly at this point I am really
really shocked and impressed by the new
iPhone acts fisher-price and the facial
bracket and honestly at this point I am
really really shook and impressed by the
new iPhone facial recognition software I
really did not think it's gonna be this
good I thought I would easily be able to
crack it at some point thought this
routine the only thing we caught up with
today was the picture which is actually
a really really good thing so I'm
actually very glad to know that my new
iPhone is super secure if you guys did
