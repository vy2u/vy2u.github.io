welcome back to my youtube channel in
case you notice everything you might
look a little bit different right now I
slightly changed my setup and my letting
a little bit
I made the lights a lot less bright and
added a lot more diffusion so now I'll
hopefully be able to open my eyes and
not blink and close them every 3 seconds
come on camera I've got so many comments
about it I know it's annoying
you guys have no idea how much frickin
light was surrounding me in my previous
video so hopefully you guys like this
whole lot better but let me know a
sister is working on it anyways for
today's that I have something very very
fun plan that I'm actually so excited to
try out I've been seeing so many
youtubers lately doing videos testing
out mixing their different products I
saw Sophia nigra testing up mixing her
foundation first and then she tested out
mixing her liquid lipsticks to get a
funky color so for today's video I'm
trying something a little bit different
and I'm gonna mix together all of my
setting powders if you guys been a
longtime sister you know that setting
powder is a little bit of a touchy
subject for me when I first started
doing my makeup I use the Cote air
somehow too religiously and we all know
how that turned out so this one is
slowly made its way out of my routine
now I use the Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder in almost every single
video but I've tried out so many
different powders in between some of the
remotes have modify some of them add
room to brighten some of them prevent
creases but overall the whole purpose of
them is that they set the face in place
today I'm gonna be mixing together all
my setting powders they have in my
collection both my favorites and the
ones that have given me a little bit of
trouble in the past and this empty
setting powder container we're gonna mix
them all together and then we're gonna
set my face in place that actually kind
of hurt I'm really not sure how this is
gonna turn out just on my first thoughts
I am assuming that it's probably gonna
be ridiculously dry like Sahara Desert
level I do have my setting spray just in
case everything gets a little bit too
serious or my face is like you know
cracking off because
won't be that big of a surprise but who
knows I also feel like I probably I'm
gonna get pretty bad a flashback today
hopefully Mary will not come back to
play I do have to wear this makeup to an
event later on tonight but I'll be
taking you guys with me to show the full
thing I'll also be taking a lot of
photos so hopefully none of them turn
out too bad
anyways all being said if you'd like to
see all my setting powders being mixed
together put them to the test well at
work will it fail will flash like Mary
make an iconic appearance keep on
watching
so before I actually go into my
foundation today my first step is gonna
be to go into the touch of water cream
which is my all-time favorite
moisturizer as I was just talking about
obviously the whole quite a setting
powder is to dry foundation down inside
waiting in place and I definitely do not
want to be the Sahara Desert today my
skin is just wanting to clear up a
little bit so I'm trying to protect it
therefore I need to be really really
hydrated before I suck all the moisture
out for foundations today I'm gonna grab
my all-time favorite my Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD stick and this is in the shade
of Y 335 I am using a stick shade that's
slightly darker than my normal shade for
them I do have a bad feeling this is
gonna give me a really bad a flashback
today so I'm trying to combat that as
much as possible then I'm just gonna add
a few drops of the Giorgio Armani
luminous stuff Foundation and use this
to kind of blend that foundation out
this is a very very dewy foundation and
once again we're trying to add the most
amount of moisture possible then just a
bright and quickly I'm gonna use my
shape tape concealer in the shade light
stand as usual so now that we have my
foundation and concealer all in place
let's go ahead and mix all these heading
powders together I have an empty tub
right here that is ready for this
concoction the first part I want to add
is my all-time favorite which is my
Laura Mercier I have some on the top of
the jar right here so I'm just going to
pour that in and then I'm just gonna
take a little bit of a top just make
sure we have enough in there next I'm
going to add the Too Faced peach perfect
setting powder whoo that is a mouthful
this one smells literally so good and
actually smells like real peaches I love
this one as well
the only thing is this it's a little bit
orange but that may help with combating
like dark circles especially under the
eyes and in the beard area so this could
be a good addition just gonna top a
little bit of that powder in there next
one to add a little bit of the beauty
bakery flower setting powder I've
actually never tried this one out but
I've heard amazing amazing things about
it so hopefully it'll be just as good
for me
next comes of hunters that I either
don't like as much don't sit well on my
skin or gave me flashback our verse can
afford a little bit of the RCM A&amp;amp;O color
powder I did not like this one as much
it clung to my skin a pretty bad oh my
god and also did way too much
brightening so who next will be the tart
smooth operator Amazonian clay finishing
powder next is gonna be one of my
all-time least favorite setting powders
which is the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD
setting powder listen I love makeup
forever they are an amazing team they
have a lot of amazing products I use
their foundation in every single look
but this proto is just really not a good
one at all I know it does give it very
very bad flashbacks so I'm probably
gonna have to stay away from the SAP
chat tonight I'm just gonna pour a
little and last but certainly not least
we all know this one hmmm yes we do
that's enough so that is all seven of
our setting powders mixed together today
I am very very scared for this but I'm
gonna put the cap back on and we're
going to shake it up sick sick sick Oh
shake shake shake shake your powder
shake your powder I need to stop so
looking at the powder in the jar it
definitely looks like a normal setting
powder although it does look a little
bit chunky I'm really not sure if that's
because I just shook it to mix it
together or if it's because the foreign
laws are the powder aren't mixing
together hopefully it's not option
number two but I guess we're gonna find
out in a short second also the color
looks pretty normal as well but I will
say it does look a little bit more
orange than normal the Cody are some
powder and that two-faced peach powder
are both slightly orange a peachy tone
and hopefully that doesn't affect my
color shade they can be look like an
oompa loompa then I'm just gonna go
right into my Beauty sponge dip right
into this powder and set my face that's
really matte whoa
then of course you guys might like to
pack it on the nose choice
I need water
oh my god
as I think I'd like to really really
pack it on the nose that's what's the
one thing on my face that gets oily the
fastest this feels like a normal setting
powder to apply but I'm not kidding when
I say that I can literally like taste
the peach in my mouth I don't know if
they put too much of the peach powder
and or if it's just actually that strong
but regardless I do like that setting
powder so hopefully it's working in my
favor things are definitely getting a
little peachy up here in the sister
studio so looking close up with my skin
in the mirror I look very very matte
there's like not a single trace of oh oh
my god okay not only do I look matte but
I also feel matte - holy crap looking
closer with my nose wherever there is a
two spots right here with the foundation
there's a little bit worn off there were
two little specks of setting powder that
wouldn't go away and I'm a sweet that's
from the LRC I'm a powder because I
remember that happening a lot when I use
this powder and like stuck to my
foundation and when I rubbed it away now
I'm left with a little bit of
discoloration right here so hopefully
I'll be able to fix that when it comes
to the most contouring later on but I
knew I didn't like this powder before we
make my face I'm just gonna go in and
I'm going to contour and bronze my face
normally using my Kat Von D shade and
light palette and my benefit hoola
bronzer as always once we're onto is it
of course we have to bake our face so
I'm gonna get my blending sponge once
again for morphe and dip into our custom
M powder concoction right up in here and
we're going to turn on the oven at 350
degrees and bake it up the point of
baking is not only to prevent creases
but it's also to brighten and add a
definition to makeup so with the
addition of the makeup forever setting
powder which heavily has a lot of flash
like and a lot of lightness and also the
RCM a color powder which is white
hopefully this will do a really really
great job with that and not make me look
disgusting
while we are baking at 350 degrees in
the oven I'm gonna go ahead and quickly
do my eyebrows off camera just to save
some time always some eyebrows were all
set in place it has been about 20
minutes now so let's go ahead and wipe
off the bake and see how this powder
actually held up
a hole so far so good everything is
still really really Merritt and set in
place and it does look a little bit
brighter if you see like underneath this
contour but I feel like the true test is
definitely the nose contour so let's
wipe this off as well obvious I mean to
me it looks like my normal nose contour
I mean I did tell you guys I lost my
nose contouring brush so things in that
department in general have been a little
bit wonky but over life like it looks
really really good it didn't cling on to
my skin at all which is the thing that I
was very very worried about everything
looks really nice bright side plate so
so far I actually have no complaints I'm
gonna get my face a light misting of the
Scandinavian makeup finishing spray just
to make all the powders kind of melt
together because lord knows we have a
lot of it on right now I'm gonna go
ahead and do the eyes and the rest my
face off Kara and then I'll be right
back with the finished look then we'll
put the setting powder concoction to the
true test and see our seven powders
mixed together sister approved we'll
have to find out alright guy isn't only
a few hours later this is the finished
look I came up with today I came up with
this purpley half-cooked crease and I
added a winged liner as well I haven't
done purple or a wing in such a long
time and honestly I just felt like I was
missing something in my life I needed
that purple smokiness that cut winged
liner and I am in love with on this look
turned out just in case you're wondering
I catered it using the brand new morphe
15 and palette this is Dean bytes that
our palette from the holiday collection
and it is so so stunning friendly
reminder you can use code change or 10%
off all morphe products in the holiday
collection I would definitely recommend
this so look at my face in the mirror I
am very very matte there was no question
about that
literally dewy skin never heard of her I
have literally no shine anywhere on my
face except for obviously the place I
put highlighter but I feel like even my
highlighter today is not shining as
bright as normal because we layer it on
so much powder beforehand I don't think
my face feels really really secure like
I said earlier it even feels matte like
it's super super dry so honestly I feel
like this may last for a very very long
time but I have literally no idea we're
gonna put that to test so I'm gonna go
get change this outfit is a little bit
dusty if I do say so myself
I'm gonna put on a hat and jacket
because I have a birthday dinner tonight
over in Malibu to celebrate sister
Patrick stars birthday I love him so
much and we're gonna be wearing this
makeup all night will it flash oh oh my
god before I leave let me take a flash
test right now before we actually leave
the studio that's your test
it didn't flashback not even gonna lie
I'm a little bit shocked right now I a
hundred and fifty percent thought we
were gonna have a flash like Mary
situation tonight I was really really
ready to take a whole lot of snapshots
how's the internet go crazy once again
only to use it for video promo for this
video but this is not a bad thing that
being said even though it's not flashing
back now and may flashbacks later on as
the powder wears down and we make it
creases so like I just think before I
got sidetracked
I'm gonna go quickly get dressed with
the event tonight and I'm gonna head out
and I'll make sure to keep you guys
posted on throughout the night with lots
of updates with my sisters and friends
will this mixture of the seven most
popular setting powders stay looking
amazing like it does right now or will
it get crazy and Crocky and gross and
cakey you'll have to find out okay
sisters we're here at Nobu I have
sisters Karen and crispy and Sydney I'm
gonna ask all of you individually what
do you think about my skin right now
smashed skin let's put together a little
more matte than usual very matte full
coverage personally I love
okay powdery us here with sister Yoli
glow the one who lays my skin all the
time Yoli
what do you think what my skin right now
like what does it look like I approve so
this is a powder that emphasizes texture
you guys in issuing an amazing job
because it's really emphasizing all of
it oh and you don't set your makeup how
bad it'll look by the end of the night
guys I'm with the woman of the hour
sister sorry I have a question for you
okay what do you think about my skin
right now she's full cover she's bad
I like it does it look good yeah but
it's good I mixed together every single
setting powder that I own and use that
to set my face today not my powder bitch
oh no I need you to read it was yeah
foxes December 4th even ah master wobble
darling thank you thank you babe hello
sisters and back home from the birthday
event that was literally so much fun I
have reading on right now because it was
literally so cold outside
I'm actually so happy that it's finally
getting cold in LA I thought I was gonna
be summer all year round but winter time
is coming and it's currently 11:47 p.m.
meaning I've had this makeup on for just
over seven hours now which is crazy
because guys this looks so good
I did not touch up once tonight this is
the first time since I started wearing
makeup and going to events that I did
not bring a beauty blender with me to
even like do some touch-ups or to powder
my face and this still looks so bomb I
can't frickin believe how mad it looks
to like
there's literally no oil at all like not
even on my nose and you guys know so sir
James his nose is usually a problem
place everybody that I asked out my skin
tonight said that it looked really
really smooth really really good really
really full-coverage and really really
mapped I mean obviously we did mixed
together 7 powders to set my face today
I hate to say it because I honestly
really thought this is gonna be a
complete joke but as you saw not a
single one had flashback my skin looks
smooth it still looks smooth it's still
dry it's still not guys I think I just
found my new favorite makeup trick this
is obviously the first time that I've
ever mixed setting powders but after
trying this trick out I honestly do
think I'm gonna make it a custom
concoction to use for everyday use I'll
probably end up mixing my Laura Mercier
my Too Faced peach perfect and then a
little bit of the Cody err some powder
because these are my all-time favorites
I don't know about the RC ma or the
makeup for everyone because these do get
pretty bad flash like and this was a
little bit clingy and I think that I'm
gonna have to test out the Beauty bakery
one a little bit more as well because
obviously I've never actually used this
on its own so I definitely want to see
how it actually wears before I put it
into the baked concoction but using a
victus setting powders I think is a
really really cool thing that I can't
believe it actually never thought of
obviously the whole point of mixing them
is like to get the best of all worlds of
all the different setting powders so I
really really like this check and
definitely recommend to you guys if you
guys have a bunch of setting powders mix
them together try out your face
and definitely let me know how they wear
throughout the day did they crack do
they look Matt I want to hear the team
because I am so shocked at the results
of this and I definitely want to keep
doing this all right guys let us all I
