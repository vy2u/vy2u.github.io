Oh
hi guys James Charles here and welcome
back to my youtube channel this costigan
I went to a generation beauty and Los
Angeles and I got to see everybody and I
got to meet so many of you guys which is
so much fun
for today's book I decided to do this
monochromatic pink glowing glam I love
this look this is what I wore to
generation Beauty at this Costigan and
so many of you guys are asking questions
reps I figured I would sit down and do
tutorial like I said in my last video I
have not done any creative look in a
long time and let's be real one colors
and the most creative thing a little but
a leave it's not everyday wearable glam
trust me we'll be getting it's more
conceptual crazy look soon especially
with Coachella coming up but for now if
you guys want to see her and created
this look make sure you would keep on
watching I'm first going to start off by
priming my face as always is my benefit
Porefessional primer nothing new just
slopping this on over to get nice and
smooth base for foundation today I'm
actually going to be trying a new
combination I am very very excited for
this one of my friends recommended this
combo to me and he always looks so
freaking bomb with the most beautiful
flawless skin
so I said this afar earlier on today and
everything up and we're going to do a
little bit of mixing I'm going to use my
Giorgio Armani a luminous L foundation
in the shade 3.5 this is way too dark
for me so I'm going to be mixing it with
the Urban Decay Naked skin in the shade
2.5 and the bare minerals complexion
rescue in opal which is the lightest
shade so hopefully not alike even
everything out I guess
well this is very liquidy cool Brown I
love this looks closed until apply this
today I'm using my morphe e-40 brush ok
I'm switching to a beautiful valley just
could not do the whole rush situation
alright I'm not too sure how I feel
about this just yeah this is the first
time I've ever mixed foundations i like
the coverage is giving me it's like a
nice natural coverage not sure if i like
the texture but then again my face is
already really textured to begin with so
i'm not really sure if it's just me like
imagining worst texture or like if
there's I don't know well I'm just going
to keep going and see what it feels like
later on we're going to do that I'm
going use of course my fav deist
heart-shaped tape I use a lot less
computer than normal today I want my
skin
look like really natural and like really
dewy and glowy with the foot not as like
cakey like my normal everyday makeup
all right so overall actually really
liking how this is looking I didn't pre
oh I went to the back and then I'm going
to stay under my eyes by Laura Mercier
secret under-eye brightening powder wow
that's a mouthful
the foundation is suffering a little bit
in the north region but I mean are we
really surprised like it's Jim Charles
know they have to pre-prime like 15
layers anyways to begin with so this is
no shocker I'm going to really lightly
just wear that little Lucy occurs so
that I don't like you just took a turn
for the worst my seeing things I think
I'm just so used to a makeup forever
stick at this point that anything else
is just going to look so strange to me
I'm probably over exaggerating like I
said I'm going to keep going we'll
figure it out later
so Bronson i3z me a middle shade of the
Kat Von D shade late college Lemoore
p.m. at 4:35 I did just buy a new
palette at Sephora earlier on today but
I'm going to get all the ways out of
this one that I possibly can
I feel like that secret under-eye
brightening powder may have it secretly
brand on my under eye a little bit too
much Laura Mercier girl I trust that you
intense the foundation on my nose is
separating a little bit I'm going to
lightly and I mean super super lately
try to cultivate eyes using my own 4-3-3
this is just a normal blending brush a
lot of you guys asked to and when I do
my no contour I always like to bring
back shadows just the tiniest but into
my brow bone region
it always looks kind of changed if you
have like a really tension nose contour
going like all the way up the bridge
Manolos and she's like stops here so I'd
like to blend it just a little bit open
to like the socket where our ages are
just to kind of make everything
continuous and flow and look as natural
as we can get to start off my browser go
to using my benefit precisely my
problems in the shade number five for
this particular one I'm keeping my brows
super fluffy and almost natural I want
them to be very very like editorial but
she pushed out so I'm doing no the same
way I did in my last video the everyday
makeup routine just sketching in hairs
and then brushing upwards to blend them
out I'm going to super lightly conceal
and clean up that brows using my Eve or
t3 and a shape tape concealer and then
just a tiny bit of benefit gimme brow to
brush the hair
upwards and keep them in place okay well
for once I'm actually loving how this
throttle turning out maybe today will be
a good makeup day unlike the lab station
yeah it's a very very similar to my
everyday makeup routine brows just light
fluffy and natural so prime my lids for
shadow I'm just gonna use a little bit
more of that shape tape concealer and I
just setting those in place using Maya
I've already found four more feet and
like Cody or some powder come on guys
you know me how to fit it in there
somewhere
for eyeshadow today I'll notice her off
with Miami four four one four morphe on
the makeup single-channel in the shade
bitten really lightly placing this in
the crease and on the lid to bring and
you kind of really blown out pinky a
cool toned red smokey I only go to using
I think like probably one or two shadows
to this entire color and you could
totally switch this up to be any color
that you heart desires I just showed you
picked today grabbing that same exact
shadow I'm a tempura 33 I'm going to
deepen up the lid and just blend that
into the crease and I'm also using the
ocean and Sigma change you begin our
shaving my lower lash line for the lid
I'm going to spread my AB 705 with a
little bit of Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray and then I'm going to use
the untamed pressed pigment oh well
they're so pretty and then going back
into my um four three three two one oh
the edges
okay I just did the other eye off camera
so we can save some time and not be
sitting here for a million years now
normally next I would do lashes but I'm
going to kind of skip around and change
up the order a little bit for this
particular look taking Miami 5:09 I'm
going to dip into a little bit more of
that bit in a shadow I'm actually going
to be using this eyeshadow for blush and
it's just a powder so it'll totally work
and I would normally use a blush but I
don't really have anything that will
match this exact color and I wanted some
type of thing to be monochromatic and
really really cohesive
I'm going to super lightly dump this
color over my cheekbones where we're
going to my blush and my highlighter as
well so the two will mix together next
I'm going to go to this highlighter from
a star crush middles in the shade
rosy future these products are so Bob
and I don't think I've talked to them on
my channel before I used to have a code
it expired but now it's facts I wanted
to feature this today if you code it
James on the rest that you get 50% off
all products this video is not sponsored
I promise I just love featuring brands
that I love and support
one better cheek because I know how
expensive makeup can be these guys are
four freaking dollars with the coat and
I'm pretty sure they're single shadows
or like a dollar and fifty cents it's a
really good deal we're really very proud
if you haven't checked about you totally
should oh that's it I'm talkin
low I'll be tied to the glow on the
cheek and I'm also going to put it
underneath the brow bone and in the
inner corner and just as a side note I
would definitely recommend applying
these highlighters for the wet brush
using a tiny unsigned 15 D differ from
one was a little bit more of a
highlighter with a wet brush and it's
going to intensify the inner corners
I'll also the need to rush to a highly
my nose next time I go back in to buy a
blush brush in my and shade and just go
right over the blush and highlight
organzations they're nice and blended
together to line my waterlines today I'm
going to be a makeup rubber lip pencil
in the shade of 20 this is just a pink
liner that is hopefully safer the
waterline I honestly wish I didn't
unless garibai now that I did there's no
going back so I'm going to pop on the
Lily lashes in the style Lux does it
doesn't look funky so something and
everything out of like a weird order I
guess everything is kind of done except
for the lips which is strange this feels
really awkwardly kind of million more
things to do but I guess we're done to
be perfectly honest the foundation
combination is not my favorite I do feel
pretty cakey but at least I tried
something new for all you guys that were
complaining I'm using same products
you're freaking welcome back to the
makeup over stick for the next video I
don't really know what I want to do with
the lips or the slit but my first
instinct is I need to block them out and
then do highlighter so I'm going to try
that first
mmm okay hey just let me find a lip
color and I'll be right back
yes much better I just applied my over
liquid lipstick in the shade of the
Broncos buy more p160 - 1/8 brush it's
just a liner brush I always usually do
our black lipstick with a liner brush
just because it's so much easier and
once you mess up you can never go back
so better to be safe rather than sorry
once our lipstick is dried down I'm
going to go in once again to that
starfish middle color in my morphe emma
705 brush to pack on and make a metallic
lip all right guys and this is the
completed a monochromatic pink glamper
today I'm honestly loving the - totally
go monochromatic one color Glo thing it
was really fun to sit down and
experiment like I said in my last video
I have not had time to do any creative
books in a long long time so this is so
fun to do also I wanted to join Beauty
this pathogen in LA which was so fun it
was so nice meeting all these I thought
I got so many questions about this
makeup so this is it this is what I wore
and for all of your ends questions also
you could do literally any color you
wanted pink obviously blue purple green
would look so pretty with holding a
monochromatic thing and if you try this
yourself please make sure to Tanya
incertum I'd love to see all of your
beautiful colorful monochromatic faces
