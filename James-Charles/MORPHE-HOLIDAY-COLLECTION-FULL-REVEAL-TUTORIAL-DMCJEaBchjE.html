welcome back to my youtube channel so
now the Halloween is officially over and
we are on to November that means it is
officially holiday season I am so so
excited because the following winter
time is by far my favorite time at the
entire year this is the only time that I
am slightly missing upstate New York but
I'm happy in LA I love a good breeze all
the leaves falling from the trees and of
course all the pumpkin spice latte
things but most of all all the makeup
brands out there holiday collections as
many of you guys know I'm currently
doing a sister upload week where I'm
uploading one video every single day for
an entire week we started this past
Saturday so make sure to check out the
previous videos if you have not seen
them yet and we have plenty of fun
videos coming soon as well that you will
have to say too and for but for today's
video I'm so pumped because I am gonna
showing you guys the brand new morphe
Holiday Collection you guys know I love
morphe so much I literally like one of
them all the time and even have my
coupon code for them on one of my
hoodie's but I really do love them as
both a brand and their products I think
they're really really great and this is
more B's first ever big big launch like
this and I had the absolute honour of
being able to actually model for the
collection and it was so so much fun so
without further ado if you want to see
all the new holiday items and how I
created this eyeshadow look today using
the Brady with 39a palette make sure you
keep on watching so a few days ago I got
a rather large package sent to my
doorstep and when I opened it up it came
with this then it literally cannot even
fit fully on the camera but this is the
pr package the morphe Holiday Collection
came in before we even get into the
actual products let's talk about this
freaking packaging because this is
absolutely stunning a lot of people
complained in the past about more V's
packaging being very very cheap looking
and I do not think that that argument is
if I want to make it all anymore there
are new stuff and new design and
products look so so good I've been so so
proud to watch them grow from the
beginning to where they are now it is
truly so exciting okay so looking at
this entire collection in front of me
there are a lot of things you have more
people definitely not playing around
they said girl your stockings are gonna
be stuffed let's go to knock out the
brush collections first so the first
thing I want to show you guys is the I
still a six piece brushed collection now
before we even talk about the actual
brushes inside once again the name
isolates so good the packaging off
stunning so opening us up you get six
different brushes for doing your
eyeshadow with and also a cute little
gold bag to store them all in I do not
even know this is a part of the
collection so cute you definitely have a
lot to talk about here so I'm just gonna
go through these drawers there quickly
but there is a tiny brush for doing
winged liner a pencil brush which you
guys know I always love to do for
highlighting my nose
but in our chorus my brow bones or any
detail work on the eyes of course a flat
top concealer brush for any cleanup work
I love using one of these to clean up
underneath my brows or sometimes my
winged liner or even my lip line if it's
looking a little bit wonky we have a
fluffy Packer brush which is perfect for
packing on any eyeshadow to the lid then
of course a fluffy blending brush whoo
that's a mouthful right there this will
be perfect for applying shadow into the
crease and on the eyelid and then of
course blending it out as well and then
of course a fluffy synthetic brush I
absolutely love using these for when it
comes to like blending work that needs
to be done a little bit more soft that
makes sense for instance like blending
out a nose contour or blending out a
shadow that's already applied like with
no product on it or I also use one of
these for blending out my eyelid primer
all the time so that is the I slay a
brush collection like I said it is a six
piece collection I'm gonna put the price
of it right down here so you guys can
see it because I don't know the prices
off the top of my head I think it
definitely has every different type of
brush that you would ever need to start
off and I sort of look so this would be
a really really great look for beginners
so the next brush that is called
complexion goals in one skin the
packaging is so beyond beautiful and
this a five piece brush collection and
based on the name and the size of this
box I'm assuming this one is going to be
for skin and complexion style brushes
okay so opening this up once again we
get a cute little brush case and then of
course we have the five brushes that the
complexion collection comes with so
starting off in the order that I would
use them in we first have a flat top
kabuki brush physically perfect for
blending in your foundation and it is so
so soft next we have a fluffy a rounded
brush and I would use this to set my
face in place using a translucent
setting powder
nice to have this a fluffy angle brush
and I would use this to contour so I put
it right here it has all of my
cheekbones of course we have two snaps a
jawline and the forehead as well so
after I contour you guys know that I
like to lightly bake my face a little
bit after baking I would go into this
next fluffy tapered rounded blending
brush whoa and use this to a whiteboy
the baked or deep it up my contours a
little bit
and lastly finally not least we have of
course the classic fan brush which
everybody uses to highlight and get that
blinding glove
alright guys that is the complexion of
goals brush collection all complete like
I said it is a 5 piece of brush set and
I'll put the price right down here I
think this is once again a really great
set for any beginner who likes to focus
on their skin I know my skin you speed a
really really big problem spot
especially when it came to my makeup and
I've been working so hard on it and it's
finally in a place that I'm like
relatively happy with so I would
definitely recommend this brush set to
anybody who wants to really have that
slate it's matched porcelain face tuned
in real life looking skin alright so
last but certainly not least brush
collection I wanna tell you guys about
today is the bling it on brush
collection opening this case up you get
once again a cute little storage thing
and this is more of like a rose gold
envelope I think it is so cute and then
opening this up you fold this little
Slough and you get little individual
compartments for all your brushes so you
can keep them super neat and organized
so this right here is a seven piece of
brush collection it comes with three
different face brushes and four
different eye brushes and these retail
for a whopping $79 I know that price
hike is definitely a really really high
it but these are definitely a
collector's item these are rolls called
brushes and then they have the cute
little crystal bejeweled handles they
are absolutely stunning
these are definitely gonna be a
collector's item I would not recommend
these for the everyday makeup wear these
are gonna be a really really great gift
for anybody that really really loves
makeup and the beauty rules I know that
I personally will never use these
they'll be displayed proudly right next
to my diamond brush collection for more
free launched a few months ago these
will be a really really great gift for
anybody that absolutely loves the makeup
world alright so those are all the brush
collections all complete but before we
move onto the eyeshadow today which I am
so pumped for I do want to show you guys
two other sets that came out with this
Holiday Collection those being the
weapons of mass seduction sets literally
once again the names so good we have
pure nude and deep smoky and these are
basically five piece sets they come with
it as you can see because they block gel
liner a black eyeliner pencil a smudger
fluffy brush and a tiny detailed smudger
brush and of course this little trio of
eyes shadow colors right here a black
brown and they more op bronzy copper
shade then the same exact thing comes in
the set pure nude but this is the
eyeshadow trio comes with instead and it
is like a brownie cranberry shade a
light pink shade and then a light orange
shade perfect for a more natural every
day on the go i shadow look I think
these days are gonna be perfect for
anybody who is more new to makeup or a
beginner
it's literally $15 for a five piece set
of everything you could possibly need
for either a smoky eye or a more natural
high finally we get to move into the eye
shadow which is what I know all of you
guys have been waiting for and I'm so
pumped for before we actually get into
the main star of the show though we have
two smaller pallets being the night
master and the day it's layer so this is
the base layer palette it comes with 15
different shades and retails for a
$15.00 so definitely super super cheap
it has a mirror at the top as well which
a lot of morphe palette sodon't have so
thank God they out of this it is so
incredibly helpful that you can do your
makeup on the go and this palette comes
with a lot of warm tone shade such as
oranges than the classic Browns and then
we even have any more like ready burnt
shade to put on top of the lid
definitely a beautiful mix of mattes and
metallics and I think this one is kind
of comparable to the 35 oh just a fewer
shades for a more concentrated look
obviously not everybody can carry around
some huge ass palette with them so I
think this is a really really great
palette for travel and then just like
the days later we have the night master
palette once again this one is $15 for
15 shades and this palette is more cool
tome with like browns still a few
orangie tones up in here but also the
more purpley cranberry tones for a more
night on the town a type of look finally
the palette that I've been so excited to
tell you about is the 39a which is the
dare to create palette so this is the
31-day right here and if you'll notice
it is much bigger than the typical
morphe palette that's because if you
open it up this is what you have inside
most morphe palette retail for $22 and
have seven rows of five-minute Oh five
rows of seven shadows that's right and
this pot is definitely a lot different
than the typical morphe palette this one
retails for $32 and it comes with 39
shades instead of 35 but as you'll
notice the middle row of this palette is
all bigger than the average pan size and
these are all transition shades I think
this probably is absolute genius because
not only are there literally seven
different transition shades for seven
different skin tones or seven different
looks the pan sizes are also a lot
bigger because y'all know as soon as you
get that palette that you really really
love the first shade you're gonna hit
pan on is a transition shade because you
use it all the time trust me it happens
to me all the time so I think it is so
smart to make the transition shades
bigger so you never hit pan on them and
you can use them and love them forever
without further adieu I'm exhausted at
talking at this point y'all are probably
getting a real tired of hearing my boy
so let's are playing with these shadows
so first programming the Shana to find
me on the light fluffy brush from the
ice lay a brush kit and putting that in
at my crease as a transition shade I'm
just putting the shade all over my
crease to get a light wash of color on
there to prepare for all the shadows
coming soon I'm not gonna grab the shade
of vivid on that flat Packer brush on
the same brush set and use this to to
find out the crease a little bit more
I'm gonna do a little bit of a halo eyes
today so when it comes to the crease I'm
keeping it pretty rounded and when I get
to the outer corner I'm not pulling it
out and winging it as much as I usually
do you guys know that I love doing that
so this is pretty hard for me but I
think the rounded iced-tea was gonna be
beautiful for today's look next under
grab an Abbott 514 brush and dip into
the shades passion and vibrant and just
mix them together to deepen up the
crease a little bit
next time to grab that flat Packer brush
that once again I use to to find the
crease and grab the shade thick coal and
start to pack that on the lid I can
honestly say I think it has been a month
since I've lost use green eyeshadow I
don't really like the color green
but these clubs in this palette are so
beautiful and it is perfect for holiday
season so I figured I would suck it up
and create a bomb-ass slang camo green
look today just for you guys I cannot
even tell you how good it feels to be
able to open a morphe palette and use a
mirror inside of it to blend my
eyeshadow today just because I modeled
before this collection does not mean I
can't throw a little bit of shade at my
favorite brand this should have been
done a lot sooner and I'm so glad they
finally did it once that's all blended
out and I'm happy with where the green
is I'm gonna go to the other side of
that flat Packer brush and dip into the
shade so glam it is like this bronzy
antique greeny gold type of color it is
so beautiful and I'll grab a little bit
on my morphe setting spray and I'm going
to spritz the brushes to get it nice and
damp so the color is super pigmented and
then I'm just gonna pack this right on
the center of the lid that's beautiful
I'm next I take the pencil brush on the
ice like it and I'm gonna dip into the
shade pine and I'm going to use this to
blend out the edges and deepen up the
inner and outer corner of this halo eye
this pie and she definitely does have a
little bit of kickback so make sure to
top off your brush before you apply it
or else you might be looking a little
crazy and then just for a little bit
more vibrancy I'm gonna dip into the
shade muse which is a block for the
pallet once again so glad more because
finally adding blocks with their pallets
I always love a little bit of block to
define and just be everything a little
bit more deep and then back into that
original fluffy brush that we use for
the transition shade
for one final pop on the island before
we move on to the lower lash line I want
to show you guys saying that I am so
excited about and that is the master of
metallic sad so these are here are the
master of metallics and these are cream
eyeshadows and these are probably my
favorite item out of this entire
collection aside from the 39 a palette
of course this set of three cream
eyeshadows comes for $12 meaning there
are four dollars each and these are so
beyond beautiful so comes with the shade
gold bronze and copper oh my god and my
opinion they're pretty comparable to the
steel out liquid metals they're
definitely not as like a glittery but
they're really really beautiful and
metallic and shiny and this is the only
$12 for a set of three meaning there are
four dollars each you guys you have to
get these and I really really hope that
more he comes out with more of these
soon because I definitely will be
needing a lot more colors first today's
I'm going to take a little bit of the
shade of gold and pop that right on the
center of my lid oh my god that is so
pretty then before ties down I'm just
gonna take my pencil brush to make sure
the edges are nice and blended out so
lesson learned these definitely dry down
really really fast which is definitely
not a bad thing but if you're gonna be
playing with these just be careful work
in small sections and blend fast because
this looks so bomb by the way speaking
of fast dry down times as well you're
kidding so now that the top lid is all
done let's go ahead with the lower lash
line I'm person I got that fluffy brush
once again from the isolate collection
and different to the shade it defined me
just for any light wash the color or the
smooth blend on the lower lash and then
using a tad a 514 with a shade of
passion and deepening that up a little
bit and then placing the shade too
fickle on the inner and outer corner
using that pencil brush once you're
gonna got me a little bit of Muse on a
tiny liner brush and I'm going to place
that right on the inner and outer
corners just for a little bit more
definition and then just putting a
little dollop of the gold cream shadow
right in the center so next we have two
more kits from this collection both
being to draw attention sets they come
in neutral and bold and these are both
sets of ten different eyeliner pencils
it is $19 each for ten pencils per kit
and this is what they look like and for
today's like I'm gonna grab the shade
coconut oh today so I'm gonna grab the
shade coconut I don't gotta use this to
line at my lower waterline for lash
today I'm gonna quickly pop on a pair of
house
psychotics once again thank God for this
mirror situation it is a literally a
holiday miracle alright guys and that is
one holiday I all complete I'm gonna do
the other one off-camera quickly to save
some time and I'll be right back to
finish out the rest my face and the
collection alright guys so those are
both holiday eyes all complete I just
went ahead and I quickly did my
highlight off cameras we get that
natural glow and now to move on to it
the lipid II doodahs they're actually a
ton of lips launched with this
collection the first two items being
these two lip kits being painted the
town nude and paint the town red
both retailing for $12 each with three
different lips inside so $4 a liquid
lipstick so in the paint the town notes
that we have this shade Lulu
sweets which is the lightest of the
three and then dainty and then in the
paint the town red set we have the shade
of stunner which is a deep blue toned
rabbit bonnie which is a true like
bright red perfect for the holiday
season and then finally the chain lovely
which is a more orange a tone red they
also launched five different metallic
liquid lipstick shades that all retail
for $12 each
just being straight-up honest metallic
lahood lipsticks are really not my
favorite I'm not the biggest fan of the
look of them but I'm gonna show you guys
anyway just in case you are because
that's what early 5 we had this like red
metallic shade which is called spotlight
there's also this bronzy shade called
luster this beautiful bright gold shade
is called Goldy this shade called
reflection is the very like mutant
purpley mommy color but on camera it's
showing up really really vibrant which
leads me to believe that this may be
more of like a duo chrome shade on the
metallic which is super dope and then we
have the shade it's sleek which is once
again a more a red metallic shade and
this is it next to spotlight as you can
see it's a little more purpley and a
little bit deeper for this today I'm
first gonna apply the shade of Lulu all
over and then layering over top the
shade of sweets
and then lastly family not least I'm
gonna finish off this look you see my
morphe setting spray I'm recommending
this is the completed look using the
brand new morphe Holiday Collection
I'm honestly living for this like I said
it has been so so long so I put on a
green eyeshadow because I just really
not my favorite color but today I'm like
living in the camo fantasy definitely me
