back to my apartment come on you guys oh
my god I am literally so beyond excited
for today's YouTube video if you guys
have been a true sister subscriber you
would know that since day one of moving
to Los Angeles into this apartment I've
been saying I'm gonna do an apartment
tour and guess what I have not done an
apartment door I've been here for about
a year and a half now I like it I
definitely do not love it and that is
why I wanted to do the apartment tour
today because I'm gonna show you guys my
little sister suite
my sister shelter but I'm currently in
the market for a sister sanctuary which
will be a house hopefully in the very
very near future it has been a huge goal
of mine I really really love
architecture interior design it's when I
fear things in the entire world I feel
like I've done a pretty pretty decent
job at this apartment and I'm not gonna
be here for much longer so I'm gonna
show you guys what I've done with the
place
I'm really really proud of it and I hope
you guys enjoy it too so as soon as you
walk into the sister shelter we have the
kitchen which is probably by far the
least used place of the entire house but
of course we do have our regular stove
our microwave where I cook ramen in our
dishwasher which does not get used very
often because we have paper plate and
then over here we have this like weird
little breakfast nook
cabinet situation on this wall I really
really love burning candles the sister
sense of down panel I can sometimes be a
little bit so stir spooky so I
definitely loved light candle then I
have my little Bowl that house my ear
pods my wallet and my keys because I'm
always losing I miss placing them so I
figured might as well just put them
there at my toaster oven if I ever cook
avocado toast and then just a coffee
machine it so I can make my coffee in
the morning with of course my good
morning sisters mug for my MA home so
although we don't do a lot of cooking it
you guys know I definitely do - a lot of
eating that is for sure I am definitely
a foodie i order from so many
restaurants in LA and I'm always having
friends over here so having a really
really nice dining set up for all my
friends and family to eat while they're
together is a very very important part
of this house disclaimer most of this
furniture and this property is actually
from Ikea the city was not hashtag
sponsored but at hashtag should be
because when I buy my sister sanctuary
in case you did not know real estate in
Los Angeles
exactly in the cheapest so a Cicero is
going to be broke so IKEA if you want to
hit a girl up I'd love to have you
furnished the new sister's house when I
get it regardless I just have these
place settings on here that I got from
CV to this cute little bench so a bunch
of people can sit on here and we can
sister squeeze wow so many good sister
fruits that I like I said I definitely
have had a huge interested in interior
design since I've been very very little
I'm a huge fan of Pinterest
I literally have boards and boards and
boards and boards of different
inspirations photos and these chairs
have actually been on my like a wish
list since I was literally like 11 or 12
years old swear to god I'm not kidding
so the second that I moved into this
house I ordered a ton of these chairs
they are super super comfortable and I
use them for a dining purposes above the
tiny people we have two very very large
hanging light pendants when I moved in
here we literally had to get a 20-foot
ladder and climb all the way up to the
sister ceiling to install these light
but I love love love how they look and
it was definitely very much worth it and
I'm definitely not climbing up there
again when I move out so hopefully the
next tenants like these lights and then
finally on the wall we just have these
two posters which I absolutely love
once again from Ikea the first one is
from Andy Warhol from the Modena musi in
Stockholm Sweden this has been a huge I
don't my voice let's forever I have a
bunch of them all throughout my
apartment I really really love Andy
Warhol as well I think he's a very very
inspiring artist and then my favorite
quote of all time work smarter not
harder
that is like my all-time favorite quote
to live by I say all the time it is my
phone wallpaper connected to the dining
room was actually obviously the kitchen
it but also the living room and the
office where I get all of my work done
throughout the day so along this wall we
have a bathroom right over here which we
don't need to go into this is why I
sister you don't need to see that along
this wall we have our office and this is
probably one of my favorite walls in the
entire house because this is where I'm
spending most of my time so I really
want to make sure it was super super
cute and a space that inspired me so
once again I have my little table from
Ikea and of course the Alex drawers of
course you guys know with my job we have
to say very very connected all
throughout the day it is vital to the
existence of me and all your sisters out
there so this is where all the work gets
done we have my huge iMac which I love
love love working and editing on we have
my phone charger an Apple watch charger
and then my laptop for work on the go
and then my sister I've had which I
always used for taking notes sketching
things down and just planning out
different video concepts when decorating
I knew I wanted to put the desk there
but that
left a very very large and kind of
awkward wall space that I knew I needed
to fill so I feel like a pretty good
design tip queen of HGTV and spill it
with a very very large buck face and
lots of different decor pieces and that
is exactly what I did I have a printer
right next my computer so I can print
out any files or contracts that I need
you to sign some different books my
favorite youtubers I have a few
different awards this is from the Shorty
Awards when I want it for break out
youtuber last year Thank You sisters
always being the absolute best of course
I have this little ampersand because I'm
an internet relatable team and then it
once again to some little plants here
and there to keep everything alive so
obviously all my work gets done in my
office but if we move just right over
here to the living room and this is
where all the fun that starts to happen
I'm actually very proud of how this room
turned out because decorating it was a
little bit of a challenge when I moved
in here obviously a lot of the walls are
white on the inside but all the outside
walls because this was a cornered unit
are made out of brick which makes
decorating it so incredibly hard because
not very many things match with burnt
orange red tones I try to convince a
building's help me paint it white they
would not budge I don't blame them it's
still a little bit sister's salty about
it but I feel like I did my absolute
best so of course we just have this very
very large and extremely comfy couch
from Ikea we have lots of different gray
at white and black throw pillows to add
just a little personal Flair and to make
light here a lot more comfortable
I've taken a so many sister siestas
that's a nap in Spanish I'm so cheesy up
in this couch of course in the middle of
the living room we have this little
light coffee table that I got once again
from Ikea and I'm not having like a
full-on meal and if I'm having more of a
little bit of a lazy day I'll sometimes
eat on here or put my feet up if you may
have noticed in this apartment I
actually do not have a TV and that is
because instead of a TV
I have a projector which is probably
literally the best decision that I ever
made in my entire life I have it right
under here on the bottom shelf and it
projects right over to here a big screen
that pulls down right above my office I
actually really really love having a
projector instead of a TV because it
relies on the lack of light obviously
work hello so it forces me to get my
work done during the day because I can't
use it and then at night once they have
everything done and I'm hanging out with
friends I can always pull this down
watch on Netflix on my Apple TV
I also have an Xbox down here which I
got for the sole purpose of playing a
black ops zombies literally the queen
event and a Wii which literally hello
and nostalgic memories I will crush you
in Mario Kart if you ever come over and
that is a promise moving right along we
probably have the part of the apartment
that you guys have seen the absolute
most from a snapchat and Instagram
stories and that is the sister selfie
mirror I literally love this huge
oversized mirror once again from Ikea
the lighting is literally the best here
because it's actually in the corner of
the apartment so there's light coming
from both this window and this window
which makes my highlight reflect on both
sides which is literally so good so
fresh as you can see I definitely have a
lot of plants in here I really really
love the look of greenery and plants but
they're all fake because literally every
plant or flower that I've ever owned in
my entire life has died and then last
but certainly not least we just have my
little keyboard sitting here on the
floor it's so sad looking literally one
of the first things that I buy when I
get my new sister Sanctuary is going to
be a huge huge huge professional
beautiful grand piano I literally cannot
wait but for right now we'll just have
to deal with this keyboard that I got
from Amazon but whenever I want to learn
to practice a new song that I'm loving
or at work on something myself
who knows what the future holds in case
you missed it which I really don't know
how you would because it is up sleek
huge right smack that Woodinville the
living room it's just insanely beautiful
spiral staircase which I am literally so
in love with and is actually one of the
main reasons I got this apartment in the
first place
when I was growing up for some reason
I've always had a huge infatuation first
tile staircases I always just thought
they were so cool and I'm gonna miss
this a lot when I move out but this
apartment is actually two different
stories so of course we have the bottom
level the living room with the kitchen
the filming room and the closet which
we're gonna get into a little bit later
and I'm so excited to show you guys but
upstairs we have of the loft and that is
where I get my sister sleep so let's go
up there I've actually never fallen down
this thank God but several of my friends
have sorry who's loved you the most the
main problem with the upstairs area is
that there's no window up here which is
so beyond frustrating
I only have one little string of lights
above my bed which do very very little
and it also gets really really hot up
here too because obviously we're on the
second floor and heat rises it can
sometimes be a little bit sisters sweaty
at night but I still do love this base I
think having a
locked bedroom is so cool because
obviously we have the railings and I get
to look over everything kind of see the
full apartment which is such an insane a
beautiful view and if I ever have a home
intruder I can so sore spot them before
I die of course we have my bed it right
here in the middle with some white bed
teeth just to match the aesthetic we
have a little bit of a blanket once
again for the LA winters if it gets cold
those little table lamp that I have next
to my bed I really really love this it's
just super cute and it's bendable so I
can kind of move it in any direction
that I want it to a large Jay painting
because I'm doing like I said I don't
really put that much time up here anyway
just to a sister sleep and occasionally
sisters talk and then moving down the
sister style staircase of course we have
a dis door right here which leads to the
closet I'm gonna save this room for last
because by far the best of the entire
house and I am so excited to show you
guys there but if we walk right across
the living room and dining room we get
to this door right here which you guys
may have seen in videos a few times but
I've never really given you the Grand
Tour and this is where all the magic
happens
the sisters studio I'm so good at as
soon as you walk in in the main space
once again we have a very very large
bookshelf we just have a few different
knickknacks some picture frames these
pictures of me my best friend Laura and
the entire world we have this little
poster that my mom made me saying makeup
is my art you guys gonna say that in
every video at this point before we get
a few different candles at different
plants some storage items we have my
Amazon Alexa so I can always listen to
music while I'm getting glam hashtag now
sponsored by Amazon's go ahead a sister
up I love to do a brand deal with you
guys and then down at the bottom we just
have a bunch of different equipment from
audio recording stuff to SD cards
batteries different cords different
chargers different lenses different
cameras this is like my videographers
dream area of the house and she keeps
everything there so you can say it's
super organized and get ready whenever
we're being issued during the day I've
been moving this way once again we have
the dream studio and for some reason not
a lot of GD gurus like to show this I
think it's because getting a perfect
lighting setup is obviously a very very
difficult thing it took me a lot of
trial and error and a lot of different
really really ugly looking videos but I
finally have a setup that I am super
proud of so this is kind of what it
looks like this camera and lens and
lighting setup not gonna lie I was
extraordinarily expensive it really bit
my bank account for a hot minute but
I've been saving up for it for a very
very long time and like I said having my
video quality be the absolute best I
could be for you guys or something it's
always been it very very important to me
so it was down
worth the investment clearly all this
equipment together isn't exactly the
prettiest it's definitely pretty pretty
cluttered and busy in here but all these
items work very very nicely together
so when I sit down I feel me using a
video this is what it looks like and
like I said this is taking me years to
get to this quality but I am finally so
beyond happy with the camera quality of
my youtube videos and this is what you
guys see and every single sister James
Channel video when I'm actually sitting
down to film this is what the general
setup looks like right in front of me I
have my makeup table once again from
Ikea I have a trash bin below for all my
last crises and my makeup wipes that I
use and my drawer here I just have a
bunch of different mix-match stuff from
it different handheld mirrors fixed paws
some makeup lights and of course all my
little tools like my tweezers my beauty
blenders or little scissors to cut my
lashes I of course my makeup brushes
over here I have this big standing
mirror right here on the corner of the
table that isn't in the camera frame but
I can definitely still see myself and
then on the other side we have this
beautiful TV monitor which is suspended
from one of the light poles and this
actually is connected to my camera so
I'm able to see myself live and make
sure that my angles are good the
lighting is good and to see if it stops
recording so this is kind of how
everything works together to really
create our really really awesome YouTube
video right above me when I'm filming a
video I have this boom microphone and
this catches all the sisters sound and
then behind the one I feel of course
have my backdrop so you guys know why
YouTube videos are always stoned at home
too based all on a white wall and over
here we have the holy grail closet tada
the makeup you guys have definitely seen
some vlog style clips of this kind of
general makeup storage area and I was
originally planning on doing a full on
like makeup collection tour because it's
like every beauty guru ever and the
entire world has done that but I
literally got to the point where my
collection was completely overflowing
which was definitely not cute at all so
I actually went through and got rid of
and by got rid of I mean donated like
90% of my makeup collection and now I
kind of only had my like favorite
products that I reached for on an
everyday basis and it honestly feels so
so so good so I think I can just kind of
go over in general what I have of course
I have that setting space up here
Beauty blenders lashes different
skincare foundations tanners powders
blushes and bronzers concealers and he
dragged or like more art type makeup
looks glitters more glitters liners
brows highlighters lip liners and a
regular lipsticks liquid lipsticks lip
glosses
some single eyeshadows
and makeup cleansing wipes down here I
have ISIL up health and down here I have
more excess lashes for a beauty guru I
feel like this is a very very small
collection and for me having everything
nicely organized and all together makes
it so easy for me to pick out makeup
before I'm doing a look before I'm
filming or if I'm putting something
together so I really really love the
system that I have going on thank you to
its sister desi Perkins for the
organization tips she did a full video
on her beauty room tour and this is
literally it's so insanely helpful and
these make organizing everything so
incredibly easy and really really easily
accessible on this top shelf I have at
various different wigs from whenever I'm
feeling Maya and dragged fantasy and
want to go from a brother to a true
sister these are so fun and they're just
displayed on these little styrofoam
heads and then right next to it the
makeup storage I have my youtube
subscriber pipes which are probably my
most prized possession of all time I
cannot wait to get a house and display
this literally in the front
walk-in hallway to say yes that's me but
I'm so proud of these and I keep these
where I see them every single day
in the make up filming room I love this
room I'm here majority of my time so I
really wanted to make it really really
special and really really cute obviously
but I think it's finally time to move on
to it the last room of the house if you
follow me this way out right across the
apartment we have probably my favorite
room in the entire house oh this is the
walk-in closet the first thing that you
see when you walk in is of course this
huge holding rocker right here and on
here is all the items from sisters
apparel displayed a loud and proud
obviously fans know you can get all your
sisters merch and gear as sisters -
apparel calm right here on this wall
once again we have another large selfie
mirror if I put on a new outfit at
weight to stay here and pose in front of
it and see if it looks good on me if it
frames the body well if the fine is
looking good or flat it's usually
looking flat but I can see it right here
I custom designed this entire storage
unit from Ikea once again not sponsored
but literally so good they actually have
a thing on their website where you can
put in the dimensions of your room with
walls and doors and everything and
design a full-on closet storage thing so
this is actually what I was able to come
up with and I am literally so happy with
it so proud it just stores everything so
efficiently and I'm able to organize
that really really well so and then I
only have this beautiful leather pouf
which is great for sitting on if I have
any friends over if I have my stylist or
designer over helping with al v they can
sit right here and sometimes because the
bow
was right there I'll come out of the
shower and fall asleep on here
butt-naked it's very very comfortable
that was probably too much information
you didn't need to know that regardless
the poof I think I ordered this from
Amazon I believe and then of course a
just little carpets what's sisters soft
right here the first storage area I have
our shoes and like I said I really
really love shoes starting at the top I
have all my boots from my wire cells my
Louboutins some timberlands some Yeezys
that runs different mix-and-match shoes
for the most part they're all adidas I
absolutely love adidas you guys know
where it literally all the time from
shoes shirts and jackets everything and
then of course we have my everyday go to
the Balenciaga switch you're going to
see me wear it almost every single
picture I'm sorry they're really really
comfortable and they're super cute we
have a cute little sister's poster and
then I feel like her bag I think
literally every beauty guru ever has
like 80 million Chanel bags little
purses
do you are a Louie Vuitton and the top
traders have some accessories I don't
really wear that many of them so I don't
have this drawer like very very fall but
definitely nice just to have them just
in case my earrings you guys always see
me wear the same one of my little lock
Michaels that I always wear from Louie
Vuitton and then of course my bracelets
that are way too expensive but I've
saved up for my entire life and I've
definitely been a beauty guru staple
item that everybody has so I don't
really have them in accessories but
anything that I have is stored right up
in here this deck story have my hats
which is actually thank God a drawer
that I don't really touch that much
anymore like I said if you've been
following me since day one a little you
sad the ugliest man bun and they have
terrible and these faithful hats were
glued to my head I just loved the way I
looked in them
mostly because I hated the way I looked
okay moving back a little bit here's
where I have all of my like more formal
pieces or my moral long pieces so I have
all my different jumpsuits you guys know
I love a good jumper that I feel so good
so powerful so like street wear ninja
type of look what I have a good jump
suit on so I have my graduation jumpsuit
my sister jump suit and a few other ones
my overalls are all up in here I have my
Coachella looks for archival purposes
you need to get them framed out I have
all my different suit jackets for want
to go to fancy events I literally hate
wearing suits so I don't really have too
many of them but I have a black a red
and a blue it's just in case whatever
the color coat is and then a few
different white dress shirts as well so
moving on to this wall right over here
we have my more every day at casual
stuff that I'm playing from all the time
this is mostly like shirts
sweatshirts jackets and hoodies
obviously you guys have seen a general
theme with me I don't really like to
dress up that often but I can still rock
a really really beautiful it's lame look
and make it sophisticated with a
sweatshirt
it just works trust me obviously you
guys can see that I have a very very
strict color scheme when it comes to my
outfit being white and black and gray
okay see I'll throw in a little bit of
color which is all stored in this drawer
right over here but that is very very
few and far in between so so doing over
here we have all the white and gray
pieces once again mostly sweaters I have
my underwear and socks drawer over here
what you definitely do not need to see
and then just some various different
t-shirts which are not very organized
but they're there just in case I want
them I really love this middle section
this is where I keep all of my different
jackets and kind of like more heavy
pieces so I have like 87 million
different denim jackets I absolutely
love them and a few different pieces
that are custom made by one of my fan
pages salads our illustration he paints
my face on the back of jackets hello
that is the coolest thing in the entire
world I love these so so so much I
always keep them right there in case I
want to once again so promo a little bit
because something wrong with that some
green or camo jacket and then a whole
lot of some block farmer jackets some
crop jacket some adidas jackets champion
Chanel YSL everything is kind of in
there if it's an outerwear type of piece
in this top drawer I have my sister
shorts when it gets hot in LA I don't
really have that many pairs then because
I just don't really like the way I look
in shorts but I just found these
recently which I feel a little it's so
cute and how loud they're like boyfriend
Schwartz but you know what's not cute
the fact that I don't have a boyfriend
and the second drawer down I have all my
pants and I've been obsessed with
getting really really cool pants
recently for some reason I don't know
why it's just so fun I literally used to
wear black skinny jeans every single day
I probably have like 30 pairs of just
blocks and jeans literally or right here
they're all from Laura's boutique use
code days for 10% off they fit amazingly
but I was just getting so bored of them
and I looked the exact same everything
that I've been trying to spice it up a
lot recently and then in this drawer we
just have my sweat shorts which I would
wear if I was ever gonna work out which
I'm not let's be real so the stores
probably completely who's this and then
a few different two-piece sets and then
finally on the bottom we have my like
sweat pants slash casual pants type of
drawer I love this Shore this is where I
keep all my adidas track pants that I
wear all the time and some different
Corp and pieces that I've been upset
- recently as you can see I definitely
like a very very casual item I like to
be very very comfortable while still
spicing up the office somehow and then
finally last but not least the last
section of the closet is all the way in
the back or right here and this is where
I keep all of my block pieces and I know
it looks a little bit barren right now
almost everything is in the wash
I picked a very very bad time to fill my
closet tour but you know what we're
gonna make it work obviously you guys
know that I wear a hold on a block so
this section is literally usually like
filled to the freakin brim but there's
just some really cool pieces out here
like about geography a few different
crystal pieces that I haven't worn yet
some unreleased this is apparel items
what could that be I don't know and then
just some fun pieces like this a furry
jacket but for the most part I think
that's actually it for the closet tour
like I said I definitely will go more in
depth in a future video when I move into
the new house but that's everything I
think we're done already sisters I think
that is air for this apartment tour
today I really really hope you guys
enjoyed it I know I've been saying that
I was gonna do one since moving in here
literally a year and a half ago but I
just honestly I've never gotten time to
it I'm always working I always have
boxes and people over every single day
so it's placed a little bit messy but I
figured it was finally time since I'm
leaving it very very soon to kind of set
everything up make it look really really
cute and show you guys what I've been
able to do with the place over the past
year I'm really really happy with how it
turned out and I really hope you guys
liked it as well and got some
inspiration and design at tips I know
that I'm so beyond blessed to be living
alone in the middle of Los Angeles
California and this huge beautiful
apartment I literally pinch myself every
single day because it feels like I'm in
a walking a magazine in this life is a
dream and I don't want this thing off as
bragging in any way shape or form this
would literally not be possible if it
was not for you guys so thank you for
all your love and support and for
everything you guys have changed my life
truly for the better and I absolutely
love you guys so so so much and I hope
you like this apartment tour like I was
thing beforehand - I've been saving my
money for a very very long time now and
I'm super close to being able to buy a
house
I'm so beyond excited there's been a
goal of mine since I was like literally
three years old I cannot wait to
decorate I was thinking to it that I
