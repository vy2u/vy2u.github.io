to my youtube channel i do apologize if
I sound discussing a very very sick
right now from traveling and I've been
filming all day long this is video
number 6 please save me but you know
what we're powering through cutting
grace to the place of this video I
thought I would sit down today and talk
to you guys only all-time favorite
brushes that you totally need in your
set I get messages DM tweets comments
all the time from you guys asking well
person I love the most what I use and
let I use them for so today I thought I
would just sit down and pick up my
all-time saves that I think everybody
needs is there like base
starter brush set and recommend them to
you I'll say it now because there's
going to be a ton of comments on it
I'll look everything one of these
brushes are from morphe except for a few
outliers this video is not sponsored or
be is not sending me a check for posting
this video and I don't know why people
will always like comment speculating
whether or not things are sponsored in
case you didn't know it is literally
illegal to have a sponsored video and
lie about it like I'm trying to decorate
my apartment not a jail cell that being
said I do have a coupon code of web
morphe it is James and it gives you 10%
off that 10% is Commission so it goes to
me you do not have to use my color I
really could not care less trust me and
it's just a discount that is there for
you guys I truly do enjoy all these
brushes I mean the doctors there there's
dirty and gross should show you that I
use them and everything one my luck so I
really do love their products alright
guys so grab a pencil and a piece of
paper and get ready to write down a ton
of brushes I'm just going to go in the
order of which I do my makeup routine so
yeah if you want to see my all-time
favorites just keep on it watching you
guys know from my foundation I always
use a Beauty Blender it's like my holy
grail tool I really do it truly truly
truly love it but some of you guys don't
so the foundation brush that I use and I
don't use my Beauty Blender is the m43 9
and of course I left mine in California
and cannot find it so you're going to
have to track down this one and is a
good foundation brush I'll put a picture
right here and it is $13.99 this videos
already off to an amazing oh the next
episode I want to talk like is the are
deer and this is for 2299 this is the
most expensive brush I'll be talking
about today after I do all my foundation
in my concealer and blend it in I would
use this brush and go to my transistor
- really really lightly like doses all
over the face just to get a light carbon
powder and just to kind of lock
everything at before I go in and really
like bake it up and I always use it to
blend up my neck as well because we
don't want that line of demarcation
chief Dooley sisters the next person I
use in my routine oi is the p40 it is a
pointed powder brush it is $8.99 this is
actually the first brush that I ever
bought for more fees as my face is all
set you guys know I love all the
coverage in the internal I always
followed by Mac Studio Fix foundation
powder in the shade m3 I don't know why
I'm telling you if it doesn't matter but
I always use this brush just attack this
right under the eyes and some of the
forehead Shanna and then went under the
contour area as well it's just like the
perfect brush and it really packs the
color and there in place but doesn't
make it too harsh definitely would
recommend this one
the next night what I do so my routine
is the r7 and this one is $15.99 this is
my bronzing brush it is so frickin good
it's actually like pretty large for
bronzing paddle fluffy type brush I love
English is the perfect brush for
bronzing whom it really does a really
good job of like this Persinger color on
the cheeks and I always went off on the
temple on to it before head to other
cheek and then it down the jaw line as
well the only one my all-time favorite
brushes after Bosley my next step is
always to contour and for that I
actually have two brushes that I always
use I have the m4 35 which is $8.99 in
the M 4 or 5 which is $7.99 I actually
prefer the 405 a little bit better
they are both angle poly brushes that
are perfect for getting right on the
hollows of the cheek and right on the
outer edges at the forehead and carving
on the drawing as well I like this one
because it's a little bit more stiff
than this one it's a little bit less
fluffy so it's more like a defined line
anyway they work exactly the same at
might as well just save a dollar and get
this one the M 405 after I contour my
face I say a short prayer and they
embrace my selves because my next step
is contouring my nose you guys know that
contract my nose has been a long time
learning process for me and it's
something that I have struggled with for
a long time because my nose is so early
it never looks good it still honestly
could look a whole lot better but the
one brush that literally save like my
nose contour is the JT wavy one easy to
brush with luck see that it's a mouthful
of this brush literally what's that from
the head
above this process gifted to me in a
generation beauties I never actually
bought it so I just wanted to luck see
beauty calm to look at the brushes and I
lied this is the most expensive brush in
this video it is $24 but trust me when I
say oh my god it is so worth it I always
use the angle ty to kind of sketch out
what I want the mill contour to be and
then this side is perfect for blending
it out and making sure that looks like
really like snaps but not too like dry
creamy although we love that look - I
don't have a cold luck see and I know
$24 may seem like a lot of money to
spend on such a small brush but trust me
is it so worth it I'm not even kidding
this literally stays away from my nose
Kandra is probably one of my all-time
favorite brushes as stupid and cheesy as
that sounds I seriously would not look
decent without it well my face is baking
my next up is always to do my eyebrows
if you went on to me for a long time now
you know that my brows have gone through
a drastic chain since of getting my
Instagram page and it was definitely for
the better when I first turned off my
eyebrows were huge I would pass on the
anasazi Beverly Hills different in the
shade everybody said they were so
freaking dark and thick when I did do
that silent Brown I would always use an
angled brush like this
this is the r44 and it is only 399 and I
was fully on one end and an angled brush
on the other end but recently I've been
loving using Frost has logistical for
the more light and fluffy look that is
right now has pink lipstick on this and
because I don't use it anymore but if
you still like that style of insta brow
look definitely recommend this one to
check out once eyebrows are all signed
plates they're probably looking crazy
messy so I like to go in and clean them
up using my favorite concealer and a
flat top concealer brush is the e43 and
it is $4.99 this is the only concealer
brush I ever use and it is super easy to
just go right in and carve a super
straight and on fleek brow that is all I
have to say about this brush that is
just really good once I can feel it
under my brows all pointed out I like
the one with more compute on the eyelid
to then send my eyes in place to prime
for eyeshadow to do this I always use my
e45 and my shaven and Cody Griffin
powder I use the same brush actually for
the powder and liquid and this brush is
$5.99 it's just a short domed rocker
brush and it says on the website it is a
mini detailed contour brush obviously
it's a brush you can do whatever the
hell you all of it it's never that
serious
but I really like this for packing the
eyelids it gives all the concealer of an
adult really really quickly easily and
tuck everything in place so I know my
eyeshadow
I'm going to go any winter with the face
all complete and be for the heavens we
are not ready for a shadow trust me when
I say you need this brush in your life
this is the unfort for one and it is
$5.99 it's been allotted that it is a
pro firmablend increase but there is
nothing firm about this brush it is
literally the best like big fluffy
crease brush ever and I'm not kidding I
think I had at least one two three four
five
I literally have six of them that are
just in front of me and this is just
from killing my looks today all my other
brushes are in the other room
it's always the first person to pick up
when I do eyeshadow I just use my
transition shade and I go all over the
crease the m41 is definitely easier
collection I would definitely recommend
ordering like at least two or three them
you will use all of them I promise
that's what I want to talk about is the
m4 33 and it's helping my number one if
you're a brush for more peace this brush
is 5 any item is a fluffy crease brush
and it is basically the same thing as
the Sigma e25 in the Mac 217 I was like
the holy grail preconscious that
literally every makeup whoever has at
least like 50 on it is perfect for
hitting right into that crease area it
is convinced with my where you
distribute the shadow where you want it
but it still qualities don't blend it
out while you're putting it there six
seven
yes 7 brushes right here once again one
of the ones that I have so many of but
literally use every single one of them
then I first I want to talk about today
is the m56 2 and this is another one of
those that I have several of you know
when you're doing this multi eye or a
half-cup crease and you want to deepen
off the Dekker corner and then you don't
have a darker shade so you know you have
to use black but you know if you go into
the fuzzy brush in the black it's going
to make everything muddy and growth in
way too dark this is the brush you need
in your life it's really tiny but still
topic you can get right into the crease
and outer corner and want everything
else really really seamlessly I forget
love this brush the next part I want to
talk about at the m22 4 and this one aim
is 299 I always will go in with some 6
plus or some setting spray spritzes
brush and then dip into it some italic
shadow or a pigment and then pack it
right on either cut the crease or just
do a metallic eyelid it is super duper
dense so it is absolutely perfect for
getting the shadow on there and making
sure it's all there and super super
pigmented once the eye shadow is on the
top I always go to the bottom and I
always sort of the un-- 5 6 to is the
same brush I just talked about almost
get like even color on there and then
the brush light wise use the eMeter
see this brush is 199 initiative small
details smudger brush it is perfect if
you have like anything in the waterline
that you want to blend gel or if you
just want to deepen up light up close
the lash line or do any do to work in
general really this is perfect
I'll do two such for a smokey winged
liner nice night ways pop on lashes and
mascara and lashes using tweezers and
mascara not that deep no questions
involved and the last step will be
highlighter was worth living for
highlighting my face is the m500 one
this one is $7.99 personally I am NOT a
fan of fan brushes but I'm right for
highlighting my baby that was not
 funny I feel like it doesn't
blend out the penguin easily and a lot
of times on this end I was in a straight
line of highlighter which is never ever
the goals I really like this one instead
it just gives like a nice fluffy
dispersed
heavenly glow the last and final brush
in this favorite series thank God it is
the m-43 one this brush is $4.99 and it
is a tiny pencil brush both pencil
brushes are round at the end but this
one is a little bit taper off and it
does have a slight point so I always use
the very tip of this brush to go right
in on the tip of my nose and it will
just go one line right down the basic
contour out my nose then with the same
brush a more highlighter I'll just go by
my inner corners to bring that out and
then I'll pop this on the brow bone as
well that you're not even highlighter
all over and there we go guys that
completes this favorite success series
