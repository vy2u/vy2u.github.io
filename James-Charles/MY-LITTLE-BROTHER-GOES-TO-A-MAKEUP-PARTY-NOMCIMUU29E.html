fun day so far but it's not a real in
the bureau's sometimes we have to do a
lot of different events so tonight we're
going to a party the links are gonna be
they're gonna be leggings it's a sister
cinched leg look I love us darshana leg
look it's not my sister I overdo the
change you have to win change I'm not
posting a picture this is the
traditional Jean thought would be a good
look for sister yeah
know where your crop top dude Oh weird
this crock-pot Pepsi crop top for you
roars no this one's a little bit of
print and I think it's masculine with
the red so many pairs a chain pantsuit
because they're cute and trendy
holy and we can put you in this good
Michael Costello
jumpsuit this is a James iconic
everyone will know it's James when they
walk in when you're in this looks like
it fits though it looks like a bit like
it would fit actually really nice and
cinched we love a cinch sister yes we do
oh my G bunchy overall dude why is the
waist here so this isn't over Bob it's
like it's like straight oh sure yeah I'm
just not gonna wear a shirt to an event
she proposed my wife Sal your wife L
boots plumber I don't think you'll like
the YSL bomber oh it's like shine oh I'm
scared of a human genes have like one
pair you can wear a sister sister short
wait we should put him in the flash like
Mary dress what is that what diff iconic
classic Mary dress what started my
entire career hello yeah with no pants
love you could look for sister and maybe
a pair of heels too perhaps this will be
the last outfit that we're gonna put me
MN I'm just an overall with nothing
under it I feel like you look good so
are you today okay so I need some
accessory is probably since early a
baton because James needs more fringe at
all times also a and Gucci belt cuz
again rich you down or that okay yeah
this is a good one for you and then
maybe something Kitty drinking Sonny is
its iconic I think it's a good look for
you
okay you ready
come on sister okay everybody from
Puerto yes please come out and share we
love a cinch sister nice can't really
breathe that's the point I actually love
all this looks on you're not gonna lie
you're like the masculine touch it be
easy you don't get an option go pee
ready for the last outfit come on out
sister oh this is literally James on
Instagram I'm really been watching
myself right now I'm scared this looks
so good on you
what's going on I'm scared do you like
this outfit
out of the three of those good and fresh
system particulate the five all right
definitely not the adidas dress with
heels cuz I like this cuz the crop top
so I guess the overall
look
oh my gosh wherever you you mean the
world to me oh my god oh my god sis
you're here it's so nice to meet you
do you like my time okay they come in
ten minutes
wait what
ow
thank you for your 10% off oh my god
that was one of the craziest days of my
entire life
I take my makeup off now yeah please you
finally came Thanks that's the best
feeling in the world I know this is
something that you really did not want
to do this morning when I proposed the
idea to you but did you end up actually
having a good day tonight I mean is
pretty interesting to see like what you
go through every day and like your life
and all people you know really a lot of
people think youtubers do nothing but
that's not really true
I mean James's day was extremely busy
and it was pretty stressful actually
behind the scenes of that no one
actually sees is probably the most
stressful part I give them a lot of
credit for bilious job so well oh sweet
of you I know you did not want to do
this like and the slate is bad not at
all actually not at all but it really
did mean a lot to me that you were
willing to like be such a true sister
and co-ruler
oh my god we just get this video to
sister and live my life with me today
let's do a piece and ted's what was your
favorite part and what was your least
favorite part of the day my favorite
part was probably the event Kosar
interesting to me all these makeup
artists I've never really met before and
at least favorite part was probably just
singing because I can't sing for my wife
you didn't find the eyelashes in the
nails oh yeah well that was awful too
so even a lot of today was makeup
tailored we did go to a photo shoot post
on Instagram and do some comments you
replied to a few business emails as well
and they went to in a bat
so could you see yourself living a life
like this in the future like as a
youtuber cuz we do a lot of the stuff
yeah I can definitely see myself being a
youtuber but probably not makeup base
but it was really nice to see all the
hard work that paid off at the end of
the day and I feel very accomplished
finally my face is nice and clean it
feels good to be back it's brother Ian
oh yeah thank you so much for doing this
video with me today like I said I know

lot that you're willing to indulge my
crazy but fun sister life so thanks pro
