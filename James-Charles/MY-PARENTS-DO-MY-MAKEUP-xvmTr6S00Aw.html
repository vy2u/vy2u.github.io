welcome back to our YouTube channel
today's video I'm so excited to bring
you guys a brand new episode of beauty
battles those who of my favorite people
on the planet the ones that gave birth
to me sister mother Charles and sister
father Charles welcome to our channel
brother oh my god so many time family
because they right now LA and on my
channel I do a really awesome series
called Beauty battles where I have two
different people both take one half of
my face with all the same makeup
products and they are challenged to see
who is the better ME way and being that
these two people came together to give
birth to me I makeup guru I figured what
better way to test out who I really got
the makeup knowledge from my dad or my
mom then have them do an episode of
Beauty battles so that is exactly what
we're gonna do today how do we feel
about this are we excited excited I am
excited I'm a little nervous because
although I wear makeup every day your
father is a much better artist than I am
yeah so I was gonna say that so I think
that the playing field is definitely
actually even in this situation that my
mom wears makeup every day and as the
true sister she watches all my youtube
videos she's always the first person
text me every single time I upload be
like great video you can't drink on
camera I didn't I definitely think she
has that makeup knowledge but my dad is
far more creative far more artsy I think
like we said this could be anybody's
game at this point
without further ado if you'd like to see
my parents a battle to see who was the
better anyway and learn about me and my
childhood and our crazy family keep on
watching okay so for today's video I
picked this look out for you guys to try
to recreate today it's really simple
sure I'm gonna take the Tarte shape tape
you're doing this first
so I tutored Assessors and I asked you
guys to send in questions for my parents
answer about me and my childhood and
growing up with me and sister Ian so are
you guys ready for a quick little Q &amp;amp;
slay sure why are you pushing it you're
pushing his face I'm just holding my
thing gently and you're like I'm trying
to would you keep moving it around the
first question is from Jenna and she
said ha
see you guys how did y'all react when
James wanted to start doing makeup I
just was confused at first because I've
never seen boys wear makeup so whatever
my first thought was that perhaps he was
transgender which would have been
totally fine but that was a whole new
unfamiliar area for me and I was nervous
for him and I was nervous for myself
because I knew things would change but
once we realized that James was
comfortable with himself we were
comfortable with him and we were very
supportive and still are with what he's
doing
yeah for sure it was I feel like a rough
patch in our family and our abuser is
kind of confused but I kind of like try
to explain to them as best as I possibly
could that I was comfortable my gender
identity I just wanted to do this to
kind of express myself and of course
like once I started like gaining
followers and getting paychecks and
something became more of a reality that
like I wanted to do I was like something
serious other than just a little hobby
after school going back even further
Zoe asked what was your guys's reaction
to James being gay you're gay I don't
know do you have the better side or do I
I'm not sure I got no better side
actually Oh Nicole asked how was the
family decision of James not going to
college and if he did go what would you
have liked him to study architecture
interior design fashion design I think
that would have been his forte actually
the whole College thing happened rather
quickly in my mind he was
I believe yes that he would have studied
something in the creative arts field and
I was still determined that he was gonna
go to college up until the very last
second okay so I actually have a
follow-up question for you too I was in
high school working really hard in doing
well on my grades but kind of last
second I kind of hit you guys with hey
I'm graduating early and moving to
California not going to college do you
have any advice as parents to any other
parents out there who may be watching
with their kids about college and for
those kids who might not feel like
college is the right path for them
obviously each individual each
circumstances obviously each person each
individual we're gonna be promised go
ahead so obviously each individual is
unique each situation is unique we you
answered smartypants if your son or
daughter's got good grades and they've
been working hard and they want to go to
school let them go to school they don't
want to go to school you're the dream
for about 80 grand a year so what can
that stand my life on a budget my budget
and ask what's the most embarrassing
thing sister James said as a child
t-ball
sitting at the second base line braiding
the second baseman's hair that's
embarrassing
she looks great Gabriella looked amazing
she did look great but we're at a t-ball
game priorities I didn't think the
baseball field or the infield was
exactly the place to be braiding
Gabriella's hair that's what did it for
me that's what I knew something was
but what do you think I do remember that
situation I also it's so cute how you're
like actually trying so hard for every
question I think it's cute that's why
it's funny just be natural
you're doing fine your egg looks good
it's nowhere near as dirty as mine
I draw how his jeans are coming up big
in Fonterra slash famous changed her
guys's lives I think the major change is
him just not being with us all the time
because he's living in California but it
is very surreal for me when we are here
visiting him or when we were in New York
City a couple months ago people
recognized him stopped him and want an
autograph or a picture and to me to us
I'm sure he's just James and to the
world he's James Charles and it's kind
of cool to see that everybody just watch
him but yes it definitely is scary a
little scary as well so you guys
mentioned the last question helps
sometimes a little bit scarier for the
world to kind of like know me so this
question comes from Nicole and she asks
mama and father Charles how do you guys
feel about the hey James gets for
anything as a fan it always makes me so
mad but I'd like to know how you feel
it's it's terrible and because he's a
new quote-unquote celebrity we are not
used to this and I do I admit that I do
read the comments and it just breaks my
heart that there's so many people that
are so unaccepting of people that are
unique if you don't like what somebody
does or what somebody believes in then
that's okay but don't don't be me don't
be cruel and it just breaks my heart
people are for the most part that's why
I don't participate in any of that
online stuff because as a father you
only have a couple of responsibilities
in your life one main one is to make
sure that your kids are safe his safety
has always been a priority to me that's
what scares the hell out of me because
there's a lot of
and that's always scared me school bus
I'm grateful for all his fans that
follow and protect him and support him
because it gives me strength to know
that there's plenty of people out there
that don't feel the way those selected
few do so I'll be so down this one is
for you and in a lot of cases when it
comes to boys in beauty we unfortunately
see a lot of like horror stories online
about their fathers not being supportive
from sister Kalina Papa Charles what was
it like building James's glam room and
the basement I put a mirror up and some
makeup lights and tried to do the best I
could to give him what he wanted his
glam room used to be my office it was so
I had to move out of my office
pretty much which was no big deal but
that's what I do I build stuff so it was
no problem
I had fun that was I think the really
cool experience to be able to bond with
my dad because we've always been really
close we boys built stuff together but
obviously like we were talking about
before makeup was definitely a really
rough patch for our family when we kind
of started off so that was a really
awesome just experience that we had
together because it really showed that
like they were beginning to be way more
supportive and helped me in my career it
was clearly obvious that he was
dedicating a lot of time with a lot of
energy to it and it was gonna be
something that he was going to pursue so
it just made sense to take it to the
next level and give him a better area to
work and a different set up so that's
what we tried to do next I'm gonna use
the morphe 35o palette for some color on
the eyes use code James for 10% that's
right
daddy's awfully concerned about his
daddy shadow
Karolina Oz what was one thing you
didn't allow James to do it but he did
it anyway
wear makeup to school I would have to
say everything
all right eyeliner Oh God this goes on
top of your eyes right yeah start at the
inner I guess I don't have a steady hand
should probably put my glasses oh that
was pretty good I think
don't be looking at mom what's now you
were no more nope
you're looking at mine to see what I'm
doing where's that go do it on the
bottom I don't know I don't know if I
want to put this on your waterline am I
gonna hurt you I'm not putting the stick
into the light for Christ's sake good
it's this that's not right
what's up right well why would I put a
stick on your eye do I going on
underneath your eye
no goes in there no no I'm gonna put
something in your eye it makes them look
pretty that's okay they look fine I'm
doing his eyebrows and acts I'm gonna
fill in the brows wisps don't you very
competitive I am are you looking at okay
brows this family is a funny subject
because thank God you got my dad's bras
because I know they're horrible they're
like sell anything apart
yeah I just put in the little line at
the end I don't know you should put them
together you should put him more
together yeah start like right here
right there yeah so I need to put little
here yeah you're actually a hundred Oh
get me up in the morning when you're
ready to do your eyes I'm super excited
because I've only done my mom's makeup I
think twice every time I do it she
complains because it always looks too
much but you know what I think sister
Christie is ready for a full glam
makeover stuff you guys want to see that
give this video a big thumbs up down
below I'm gonna slay her eyebrows I need
some tips on how to look prettier that's
you already look beautiful you saw your
makeup game could be a little better
sure I'm done with my brows I feel you
bro on the website beautiful if it's
matched no it's just a good word yes man
does this involve glue on your eye it
goes on the bottom of the top all right
so I've never worn false eyelashes
before so I'm not sure if you put
mascara on and then the lashes and I
know after you the lashes you always put
the mascara on to blend them together I
have no idea how to do this I think I
did it I'm going to put this on and turn
it to glue James as I should wouldn't be
the first time Kim asked what is your
guys's favorite makeup look that I've
ever done my favorite is the solar
eclipse it was my idea but it also was a
very creative very cool look that did
well I believe to reveal it said ok love
a marketing love there's been a number
of them I like the one with the hand
that was when you first started this
colony and the skull that's like two
years ago I know I just got that once
one of my favorite ones I thought was
really cool and I also like the one with
the matrix that you the color matrix on
your lips
I thought that was extremely intense I
thought those like my old yeah those
were some of my favorites when I was
younger and Saul had time to do a lot of
those creative looks I would go to
school all day for eight hours and then
go home and do my homework and then go
to work at my frozen yogurt shop and
then sometimes go home and finish my
homework or if it was a really late
night sometimes do a makeup look and my
mom always goes to sleep at like 6:00
p.m. so I'd always be the one awake so
he was at 11:30 midnight is he come
upstairs to say what do you think so he
would always be the one to do the lux
before they would go live okay this
question is from sister Sebastian and he
asks what were the options for James
when he found out you were pregnant
kind of question is that
Oh what were the name options for Jason
he found out your hip fracture if James
was a girl he was going to be named
Chloe and he was named James Charles
James after his grandpa who passed away
two years before he was born and Charles
is my dad's middle name
so hence James Charles I know you like
to have a full lip oops
so I know you over lined them oops oops
going on oh so sorry I'm pounding on the
Beautyblender yeah I had a little bit of
a ooh I do now as well now I'm gonna go
in with the liquid lips I have mine
Oprah liquid lipstick Oh Oh stay on your
side I'm gonna like do the corner of his
mouth no no put the mushroom on there
you just don't look very you're like
how's it go oh yeah you could do that oh
my god okay sorry last step I believe is
setting spray oh that's very close
I think my mom and dad have completed
their beauty battle for today I have not
seen the finished result yeah I'm a
little bit spooked Magoo my dad just did
me the honors of cleaning my mirror for
