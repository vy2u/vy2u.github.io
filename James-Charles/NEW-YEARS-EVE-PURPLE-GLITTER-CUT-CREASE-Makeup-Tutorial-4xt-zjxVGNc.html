hi guys this is James Charles welcome
back to my youtube channel so 2016 is
finally over
thank God and 2017 is quickly
approaching us but not before the ball
drops on New Year's Eve so for today's
like I threw together this purple
concretes with rainbow holo glitter
perfect for any upcoming New Year's
party you have let's be honest this lets
say a little bit extra but y'all know me
always doing the most you can totally
replace it with like a nude or a pink
it's up to it's not that deep anyways if
you want to see how I created this
entire look make sure you have keep on
watching so first I'm going to start off
as always
probably my face using my benefit
Porefessional primer I'm gonna rip a lot
of this on and make sure to really get
it on my skin this is gonna be for a New
Year's Eve party and we're going to be
getting a crumb on the day of throwing
underneath to your crystal ball that is
going to be dropping so we do not want
to sweat off our makeup today I just
went ahead in pre prime my nose using my
morphe Arthur tissue in my Mac Studio
Fix concealer and I have no idea what
shade this is it's rubbed off because I
use it so much but we all know I do this
for foundation today as always I'm going
to go to the my makeup for ever ultra HD
foundation stick in the shade y 315 and
then of course going to bump it in using
my Beauty Blender
for consider today I'm going to trying
out something new the heart-shaped tape
concealer I did use this in my no mirror
makeup challenge with Rachel that I
posted on my channel a few weeks ago if
you haven't launched it you should
totally check it out but I didn't really
get to see obviously how it works so I'm
going to be trying it up today I'm going
to use the shade light
I've already been saying like amazing
things of this concealer so okay okay
well I can see why they're saying
amazing things about this concealer holy
crap this is so good oh how I'm shocked
you
as always I'm going to set under my eyes
using my Cody or some powder in my damp
Beauty Blender I surely just help to
melt the power into the skin and then
I'm just gonna use my morphe I'm 439 to
creme above the rest of that powder into
my face just to set it in place and next
time you take my Mac Studio Fix
foundation powder and my morphe 40 and
just use this to highlight under my eyes
and the Centaurs Road and on my chin
same places that I put the concealer
just to enhance or intensify that face
contrast you get the point two bronze
today I'm gonna be using the Tarte Park
out princess palette and my morphe m-43
oops just getting em 5 to 7 and it
sculpt up the face and then of course
I'm going to contour my nose using my
age 80 81 82 brush
as always I'm going to bake my face
using my Cody our son and my powder puff
alright guys I'm gonna go put myself in
the oven for a few minutes I let myself
bake at 350 degrees I will come back
with my eyebrows already done off camera
because you see me do the a million
times I really want to focus on the eyes
today so I'll be right back for my cut
crease today I'm reusing this purple
shade of the morphe 235u palette
remember you can use code James for 10%
off all products and I'm going to be
using my Sigma EA T brow angled brush
I'm just gonna using the obviously
angled brush and not this bully I'm
gonna start by setting up this line
right above my natural eyelid crease
just kind of outlining it with that
shade of purple
and then I'm going to wing it out when I
get to the outer edge I'm not taking
Miami 213 on that same purple sheet I'm
going to begin to lightly buff out that
line
and then go your Miami 562 I'm just
going to lightly blend it out a little
bit more
I'm going to mix together the purple
with the black shade on the same angle
brush from before just to create a
little bit more depth in that cut crease
so on a normal cut crease say you would
obviously use concealer to carve it out
but for this look I'm just using this
pigment to actually carve out the cup
crease that just saves you a little bit
of time don't need to do the two extra
steps and then once I get to the outer
corner I'm going to sketch that pigma
out in the shape of a wing connecting it
to at the outer edge
for my clutter today I'm going to apply
using my Mac mixing medium once again my
242 brush same exact brush I use for
that silver pigment if i'm karis
recommend this to me I'm not a glitter
person I really I'm not the biggest fan
of glitter but I'm trying to get into it
more because it's so freakin pretty I
just hate how I use glitter once you end
up with it for the rest of your life but
you know what I guess that's just all
you have to deal with when you're a
beauty guru provide a lid today I'm
using the lit cosmetics share glitter in
the size 4 I'm not going to take that
Sigma liner brush one more time with the
dark purple and the black shade mixed
together go right over this edge make
sure the line is nice and smooth and
there's no glitter follow anywhere
and then without minor brush I'm going
to connect the outer edge of the wing it
down to the lower lash line
and then taking my time 2:13 on the same
purple shaded from before I'm going to
start to pop that light out this is the
same exact process as the crease we're
just doing it now right there
okay my camera just kinda I'm sorry all
I did was curl my lashes to put on some
mascara on at the top and bottom and
then I put some NYX jumbo eye pencil in
the shade black bean on the upper and
lower lash line just to create the smoky
dark effect and then for lashes I'm just
going to pop on my house of lashes
ikonics
and then it finish off the items going
to take a little bit more of that Mack
mixing medium up put on the inner corner
and then it's a little bit of cosmetics
shared glitter size three in their house
the up sentence okay that is one
eye all complete I'm gonna go into the
open up camera that we can come back and
get started on the rest of the face all
right we are back in the eyes of a
complete bajalia she I'm raising my two
phase sweet Pete's cloak it and my
morphe AB 501 brush oh wow that is
really pretty
all right now it is time for the lips
now of course maybe me I'm gonna do
something crazy but you can totally stop
here too like a pinky nude a pinky
orange or even like a dark purple will
be absolutely perfect to match this look
but like I said I'm gonna do something
crazy I'm first starting off by going
with the dose of colors liquid lipstick
in the shade and I want the lips to be
like a muted out skin color so I figured
it would probably be easier going in
with an actual liquid lipstick first
other than like a concealer or
foundation just make sure that they stay
on any place through any New Year's kiss
let's be real though if you're me we're
not kissing anybody so this is really
not that much of a worry
what's that lipid sorry I'm going to
take my makeup forever Ultra HD
foundation stick again the same to
actually that I use for my overall base
and I'm just going to run that around
the mouth area and then blend it with a
Beauty Blender
same exact thing with the eyes I'm going
to go to my mac 242 brush and my mixing
media we are going to dab that in the
center of the lips
and then just pressing on those glares
from lit cosmetics and the two different
sizes it just from the Centers of look
out creating a glitter ombre alright
guys and this is the completed glittery
look perfect for the upcoming New Year's
Eve finish it off I just on this black
baseball cap and this diamond choker
