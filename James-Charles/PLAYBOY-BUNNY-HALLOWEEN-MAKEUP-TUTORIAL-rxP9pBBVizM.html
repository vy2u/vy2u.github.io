hey guys it's James Charles welcome back
to my channel so I know it has been a
hot minute since I bought cells in a
video if you've been following me on my
other social media platforms but you
totally shot if you don't you know that
I've had some amazing things going on
recently that have totally taken up all
my time but in a very very good way if
you missed it I am officially the first
male cover girl and there will be a
video on that with all your questions
and all like the details of behind the
scenes footage coming soon so make sure
you definitely stay tuned now that
everything is kind of calmed down at
least a little bit and I am a back home
I finally have some time to sit down and
film for you guys and get back into the
Halloween groove today I decided to film
this super drag super glam a Playboy
bunny inspired look I absolutely love
how this turned out I posted it on my
instant yesterday and everybody was
commenting asked me to film so of course
I had to sit down and teach you guys how
to do this look full credit and
inspiration for this look goes to jubu
or instagram will be right here she is
so talented and she did this first so
this is inspired by her also this video
is a collaboration with one of my best
friends in the entire world
Tina helada or tutorials by Tina she's a
15 year old makeup artist and she is
beyond talented so we decided to team up
and do two different styles so Tina
decided to do a more toned town glam and
definitely easier version of this look
if you want to see how she created hers
make sure you click right here tell her
Jane sent you she is amazing as for a
mother cover we always got to be extra
AF on this channel you guys know that I
never do anything toned down so this is
the look I came up with this dry glam
inspired a Playboy bunny and if you want
to see how I created it make sure you
keep on watching
hi guys to begin this tutorial today I'm
going to start off by covering my brows
now this technique is definitely not the
easiest thing in the world so if you are
gonna do this for Halloween please make
sure you practice beforehand it can be
very very tricky I'm just using a
regular glue stick and brushing all the
glue into my brow hairs and then combing
every hair up with a spoolie on the end
of a brow brush to really make sure they
are flat to my face in every hair is
separated and going upwards then I'm
just going to take a damp towel and kind
of go over the edges of the glue to
blend them into my skin sometimes it can
be a pretty textured and lumpy so like I
said we really want to make sure these
are flat to create a new layer of skin
then I'm just going to do the same thing
on the
other brow and once that is coated and
dry I'm just going to continue to lay
our glue and then finding it letting it
dry between three or four times
depending on how thick your actual brows
are until you get the desired coverage
to where you feel they are good then I'm
going to set my brow hairs in place
using Kody era spawn this is my favorite
setting powder and just a regular powder
puff to really press that powder in
there once again to make sure they are
very very flat and not textured then I'm
using my morphe 48 brush to brush away
the excess hairs
now to begin covering the brows I'm
going to use my Mac painterly paint-pot
this Paint Pot is super super pigmented
I'm just brushing it on with the morphe
r32 brush to really pack that color on
there I love this because it really
covers the texture and the color of the
brows which can be very very hard if you
have huge ass caterpillar brows like I
do so I would definitely recommend this
step then I'm going to prime my face
using benefit professional you guys know
I love this primer this entire tutorial
is going to be very very out of order I
apologize this is just kind of the way I
did things and it worked out pretty well
so follow along if you choose or just do
whatever you want and then using that
same Paint Pot actually to start to
paint my nose now this technique was
recommended to me by a follower and you
guys always know that I complained about
foundations slipping off my nose so this
technique has really saved the light of
my nose contour and really helps
everything stay in place all day long it
doesn't wear out then I'm just using a
damp Beauty Blender to kind of blend
over the edges of the nose and the
eyebrow cover I'm then just going to
start my regular foundation routine as
always is my makeup over Ultra HD
foundation stick I'm just going to put
this all over my face including my brows
and my nose we really want to make sure
there is even coverage and no
discoloration and then I'm just gonna
blend that in very very carefully using
my morphe 439 foundation brush this is
one of my favorite foundation brushes
ever it is so great and you can use code
James / 10% off all morphe brushes and
products you guys know I absolutely love
them and stand behind them a hundred
percent so you should definitely check
them out if you have not already and
then I'm just going into my Too Faced
Born This Way concealer to put it in the
high points on my face and then blending
that out with the damp Beauty Blender to
really get everything it's snatched then
you look absolutely horrifying and you
get to make this face in the mirror and
at this point you are ready to set your
face once again I'm using a Cody era
spot and a powder puff just to pack it
on I'm starting off in the kind of baked
areas like the eyebrows and then
under the eyes and then I'm just going
in and just kind of slopping this
everywhere to really make sure I am full
face mat and definitely not oily or wet
anywhere to begin sketching out the eye
of the bunny I'm using my makeup forever
flash palette the white shade obviously
and my morphe m15 a brush to begin kind
of drawing it in place where I want it
I'm going to draw a line upwards problem
at the corner of my eye and then from
the inner corner of my nose and then
kind of connect it sort of similar to
the way we draw a cut crease just a lot
bigger and more dragging if that makes
any sense I'm really making sure to pack
a lot of product on there because we
want this way to be super opaque
obviously we can go over and clean it up
later on in the future and then I'm
going to take the anasazi liquid
lipstick shades in pure Hollywood and
blush mixing them together on an angled
brush and sketching that right over the
white line we just drew this is going to
be kind of the I guess eyebrow of the
bunny um I don't really know what it is
but it looks cute so we decided to do it
and it was in the original book by jubu
and I said before so I really really
love what she did and I wanted to
recreate it as accurately as possible
I'm just following the same exact shape
as the white line that I created below
but making it a lot thicker and then
tapering it off in the inner corner to
create that classic drag effect I'm then
gonna use my morphe amma 4-3-3 brush and
the anasazi a single shadow and shade
babycakes and kind of said that liquid
lipstick in place I know it will dry but
I really wanna make sure this is super
super exactly there and where we need it
to be and then notice going back over
with my m15 8 as I said before from
morphe and the same white shaded to
really make sure those lines are opaque
and very very sharp and defined then to
begin the upper fur of the eye on once
again using the same brush same shape
same color from the flash palette and
I'm just going to follow that pink line
exactly but I'm going to start sketching
in some fur this time really making sure
to pack a lot of product on there this
product while they are great can be very
very wet so sometimes I find that it can
kind of drag the foundation along with
it so really make sure you're putting a
lot of product on there so when you drag
out to be affirmed you're not dragging
out the foundation with you and your fur
remains white and super clean to set the
fern place I'm going to be using my Ben
Nye super white face powder on a flat
definer brush and just packing this
right into the fur to make sure it is
dry and super opaque and white
and then going with my Wet n Wild mega
liner in white it is a super precise and
thin liner which I love and I'm just
using this to draw in some more furs and
some tiny little hairs this adds a lot
more dimension to the look which
previously was not possible with the
flash palette and then using this tiny
Mac definer brush in my Kat Von D shade
and light palette I'm using the shade
all the way to the left to add in some
shadowing to the cut crease I'm just
placing the shade lightly underneath the
white lines that we created earlier on
the cut crease so above the top line as
well as the lower line where the liner
will be in a second this just creates
some more dimension and kind of looks
like it's like a mask that is popping
off my face so I really like how it
looks for the liner today I'm going to
be using my Kat Von D trooper liner this
liner is super precise and thin so I
really do love it and I use it all the
time which you guys know this liner
today was giving me a lot of trouble I
ended up redoing and fixing it like five
or ten times I don't know why I'm not
used to making liner this big but it is
a drag look so you got to do what you
got to do and then I'm going back in
once again with that mega liner from Wet
n Wild and just sketching in some more
hairs over top of that pink area I am
however keeping these hairs a little bit
smaller than the previous ones because
we are going to be adding some glitter
whew who doesn't love glitter me
actually I really don't like glitter
because it's dirty and once you get
glitter in your life you literally never
can get glitter out but that's aside
from the point under stating my makeup
forever mist and fix spray and then some
dollar-store glitter on my morphe Emma
242 brush and just packing this right
onto the pink area this adds a lot of
texture and dimension let's be real it's
pretty so you got included the glitter
for a drag look to finish off this I am
then going back into the white from the
flash palette and filling in my
waterline as well as a lower lash line
and then to shading once again with that
mock brush and the Kat Von D shade and
light palette to add some final
dimension and that completes one eye of
this bunny look going to go ahead and do
the other one off Cara then we can go
ahead and finish off the rest of the
face for my lashes today I'm popping on
a violet boss lashes in the style
idaho's
you guys know that I absolutely love
these I always wear these for my bigger
look such as like cut creases and drag
books they're just perfect and mice and
wispy for my lower lashes I'm popping on
janessa my Rex lashes in the style
thrive zero-one's these are really just
going to help to open my eye and kind of
further that whole drag effect and I'm
just popping those on right below the
white and the
line I'm then going in and starting to
contour my face with my morphe and 435
brush and my Kat Von D shade and light
palette I'm not going too heavy because
we are going to be covering a lot of the
face with some more fur but I am going
to go pretty heavy on my jaw line even
though we are cute Playboy bunny we
still want to be as snatched as hell as
always so I am packing on the bronzer
and really making sure to chisel out my
jaw and then just going to go in and
quickly bake my contour with my echo
tiara spot and a powder puff like I said
before not focusing too hard because we
are going to be covering a lot of it in
fur next I'm just going to buy more VM
509 brush and a little bit of blush we
are going to be using a pink highlighter
today from the Anasazi at moonchild
palette so this just really helps blend
everything together and make sure that
glow is super pink and of course I'm
using a pink heart from a BH moonchild
like I said then to start the facial fur
I'm just going into the white color from
the makeup rubber flash palette same
thing as before and that definer brush
and just sketching it where I want the
facial fur oh my god this voiceovers
literally such a mess it is still late
at night and I want to get this video
and I feel like I'm barely speaking
English anymore please bear with me once
I have that in place on then just going
back in and starting to fill that in and
similar to defer above the eyebrows I'm
really making sure to put a lot of that
product on there because sometimes it
does move around so we want to make sure
we have a white fur and not like
off-white skin color type fur then for
the nose I'm just using the same mixture
from before or those two liquid
lipsticks from ABH they are blush and
pure Hollywood and I'm just sketching
out the nose with a tiny angled definer
brush and I'm just going from nostril to
nostril and then filling the tip of the
nose in and then a similar to the pink
crease I'm setting that with the anasazi
eyeshadow and babycakes for my lips
today I'm going to be using Anasazi
Lucca lipstick in the shade at pure
Hollywood just to fill in my top lip I
am over drawing a little bit but making
sure not to go overboard and then I'm
going to set that in place in my Anasazi
babycakes single shadow as well as
setting the bottom lip with that been my
super white powder to make sure those
two colors do not transfer on to each
other to finish off I'm going into my
morphe m25 0-0 liner brush and some
black gel liner to draw a thin line from
the tip of the nose down to the Cupid's
bow and then finishing off with some
dots where the bunny's whiskers would go
