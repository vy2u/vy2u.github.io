hi sisters James Charles here and
welcome back to my channel getting
excited to play this videos what we're
going to be very long so I want to take
up any more of your time on this intro
it has been far too long to play up like
five times and kind of just chat with
you guys so something I excited to sit
down with them a little bit of a chit
chat Goethe's me a style video I asked
you guys on Twitter to send me a bunch
of questions about like my life makeup
whatever you want to know under the
Senate but today I thought I wouldn't
sit down and just talk to you guys I put
together this brown winged owl smoky
situation and I admitted to parent with
this blue appear with old custom lip
color honestly I really really love how
it turned out
I also brought back at the big breakfast
which I amount worn and a long
periodically time and I forgot to put on
a half of this video so this is
definitely a very very weird type of
situation for me to be in
I don't exactly feel like myself but
honestly I really really like sitting
down and talking to you guys so if you
want to just chill relax and hear some
questions being answered about me and
Fiona creatures definitely strange and
unique legal look make sure you would
keep on watching
oh hello everybody I am currently a
barefaced well no I'm not because I'm
putting out a primer but the hair shades
I got off a double size thank God is
looking a little dangly before not gonna
lie right now I'm currently rocking the
pepper from American Horror Story look
but you know what we're just gonna move
on and probably put on a hat soon as
humanly possible and you're like it's
been literally months I've like it's not
gonna talk to you guys I've been it's so
pretty busy as my move to LA into so
many different things going on and I've
been really really flocking on YouTube
and kind of every social media lately so
I'm so excited now that everything's
like kind of settled down a little bit I
am back and ready to kill it I really
wanted to sit down today and do a little
bit of like a chip shot get ready with
me a Q&amp;amp;A style video it's been far too
long since I like just talked to you
guys and nothing like a really Syria
in-depth tutorial so I really do miss
that a few days ago I tweeted on my
Twitter I just want to focus on you guys
and communicating
because I really feel like I don't talk
to you guys enough and that is something
that I definitely want to change so if
you don't want me a splitter of
definitely go follow me I've been
tweeting at xx nervously and following
one two people as well I don't know why
I didn't do this sooner but hey it's
never too late to be not a shitty in
flutter right I'm going to be blending
this foundation wagging it down like
next today as you can see a sister
spread hand is looking little splotchy I
have an appointment later on this week
perfect in time for Coachella this
weekend I am so freaking excited and I
hope that I'll be seeing a ton of you
sisters there it'll be me and Laura and
Susan Victor all going together it's
going to be such a good time so if you
see me you better freaking say hi I
honestly have no idea what I'm gonna be
wearing it so I am horrified but hope
they figure something else because the
last thing that we want to see is being
naked trust me
earlier on Twitter when I was planning
on what I want to do this video when I
said it out I'm doing a little to check
through an ASL video I tweeted out
asking for questions and stuff like that
you don't need to talk about so I'm
going to be answering them as I do my
grab today
the first question is from Mac and she
asked if you could do what one
Kardashian's makeup who would you choose
and why well I think I would have to
choose obviously a sister Kim just
because she is a living legend and I
have a personal bias to her because I
had the honor and blessing of meeting
her she was so frickin like literally an
angel sent for love so I asked we love
her and would love to whoever up one day
but maybe Lee after Mario dies because
that's his job and I do not want to
compete with a legend
Zoey asked where do you think your life
would be if you never picked up a makeup
brush and not oh wow that's honestly
such a hard question because I genuinely
have no idea just a year ago I was not
even doing this and now I'm living in
Los Angeles with amazing friends and
amazing people and doing what I love and
I'm able to make a career out of it this
all happened so quickly for me and I've
loved every single
of it but I probably would still be
sitting on a high school classroom
learning every single day she asked what
is your skincare routine and how do you
get rid of it weird spots and pimples on
your face that's a really good question
chase and that is a question I get asked
all the time
and unfortunately see my answer for you
guys is literally just wash my face in
the shower I'm going to sound like
complete but I swear to God I
do
literally no skincare which is
definitely going to come to bite me in
the ass later on I definitely want to do
some like research into finding good
skin care products student is just not
something that I've really like really
cared about in the past and I don't
really don't want it it's either I used
to have it very very very bad acne prone
skin when I was like in fifth sixth and
seventh grade but it kind of like just
went away and I really had to deal with
it it's weird too because with me when I
don't wear makeup for a few days then
I'll start to break out I'm definitely
not the person to ask when it comes to
thin guy plays I'm so sorry right now
what is one thing you love by your
career and one thing that you hope to do
in this future answer in this whole
doing my nose contour is that we are
it's Kelly because y'all know this takes
a lot of focus but I'm going to do my
best
how my favorite thing about my career is
just getting to me all of you guys I
mean oh that's like so chief that's what
everybody says but it truly does like oh
my god you guys are scaring my friends
if I'm having a shitty day you have no
idea how much it'll like infilling turn
around as soon as I see one of you guys
like in public or something even just
like getting happy p3 Rises truly just
makes I take it you have no idea how
cool it is to just know do you have like
an entire platform of people from all
around the world watching you in
supporting there's nothing you it one
can't get tough and trusting it they do
for everybody it's really just like nice
to be able to just get support from you
guys and hear all the nice things you
have to say that's definitely by far my
favorite part of my job I took the
future I really don't know what the
future holds I had a lot of ideas and
concepts that I would love to work on
I'll see you guys know that I love to
sing so I really want to do more musical
stuff in the future but that's hard as
well because like producing and
directing in
I'm trying to work on that everybody
oughta have nothing immediately planned
what the second I do have something that
you guys know know give you first people
to know so just keep your eyes open
there's a lot of cool stuff in the work
coming through behind the scenes for now
I'm just going to focus on YouTube and
sometimes time a good time Nicole said
it's cereal than milk or milk of M
cereal well Nicole I have news for you I
don't drink milk so cereals and more
cereal dry Oh suck your apps do before
doing a more creative books or more glam
books for me the entrances question is
extremely obvious but I think a lot of
people might think differently and that
is for sure
creative look 150 percent honestly I
hate doing glam looks literally more
than anything in the entire world I
don't know if every been just so boring
we've all seen the same with from Sophie
I accept a million times yet here we are
I better do a bronze mocha guy
in about ten minutes when I thunders
Dubrow created albums are out there
makeup looks got me to where I am today
they got me all my followers and they
are truly what I enjoy most about makeup
I love putting a ton of really crazy
stuff on my face it's like creating art
honestly but one thing that sucks up
them is that those look can take up to
like five six or even seven hours
depending on how complicated they really
are so it's much easier to do at home
when I was like still just starting off
now it's much harder for me because I'm
so busy and I have simpler on every
single day it's really hard to get five
or six or seven hours free but I really
am trying to get back into it I've been
trying to set aside some time but
recently I've been like pending a lot of
things on Pinterest and like dating a
lot of pictures for inspiration so
definitely keep your eyes peeled because
I really really want to get back into
creator so soon but yeah I definitely
prefer creative makeup looks over going
any day of the week Nicole asked James
what is your opinion on other Dolan's
work
well Nicole if you couldn't tell about
my service to Instagram comments on
their pages or whatever deal day or my
tweets to them or my ideas to them
asking
to culture the faith I have been
multiple to them and I'm very very open
to a brother-husband style oh my god
this joke is already going down
I love the Dolans that I want to vote
the country in the face and then make
out of me if I answered your eyes gently
he asked attending VidCon you asked
question mark unfortunately no I will
not be attending VidCon this year I'm so
 sad because I really really did
want to go but I just found out a few
weeks ago after I had already booked my
tickets to VidCon that is the same
weekend as my graduation back in New
York across the country so unfortunately
I'll not be a bit but I'll be at
playlist live in Orlando in a few weeks
I am so freaking excited so if you are
going to that I will be there
my meet-and-greet described enough I
think I mean great number 20 on Saturday
don't quote me on that but definitely
check it out get some tickets I can't
exceed all of you sisters uh how do you
like living alone in your new apartment
and are you going to do an apartment
tour soon it is very weird and yes
absolutely
I've been working for the past few weeks
actually on an apartment tour video I'm
working with a graphic designer to kind
of make like an HGTV style thing it's
going to be a big production this sounds
weird but I promise when you see the
apartment on video you guys are going to
be shoved to the frickin core I do plan
on doing a either two or three part
series of it I'm not 100 percent sure
yet but it is going to be a big thing on
my channel that I'm very very excited
for so please stay tuned and one of
those videos will be like a Q&amp;amp;A on
living alone and how I like decorated in
how I handle the boob so I'm not going
to answer that right now stay tuned
it'll be coming within the next few
weeks what I like especially done
decorating and fully like settled on and
I've been so crazy busy lately and I was
just traveling and now I'm going to a
hotel this weekend and I just kind of
friend think of me so there's been a lot
going on I will be done soon I promise
I want these videos to be like really
really good so just be patient they're
coming Gio asks what is your favorite
pool of all time hmm I feel like I
should really take something from like
one of the scissors apparel hoodies but
honestly it's probably work smarter and
not
harder it exactly in it like I always
apply it to my life and I feel like it's
a really good quote to like live by um
yeah that's kind of how entirely to work
every single day and like make sure that
I'm doing enough for possibly can work
smarter not harder or it's not that do
you Victoria how do you cope with all
the negativity receive I truly buy in
for sticking to career instead of taking
a break Thank You Victoria that really
does mean a lot to me I think it's
something that you really have to learn
to do it as a social-media influencer
and it's something that it's really like
it's really really hard to kind of like
grasp the fact that when you do this job
and you have this lifestyle everybody's
going to be watching everything that you
do and I think that even now today being
where I am it's taeil's something from
that is really really scary to think
about and something that I honestly
don't even like want to think about at
the end of the day if people are talking
about you and mentioning your name and
wasting their time talking about you not
only is that free publicity and free
prep but that means that you're
successful so when I see all these big
negatives we tell me I just try to keep
in mind the fact that like okay these
people are talking about me and day in
and day out because I have a name for
myself and because I've gotten myself to
where I am today it's a really like kind
of twisted way to look at it and it's
kind of sad that I like it even has to
be that way but that's the reality of
the job that I have I'm very very
thankful for I am and I'm so thankful
that I have all of you guys because if
it was not for you guys I definitely
would have quit a very very long time
ago but I have so many amazing sisters
out there that are all lot of my work
and loving the things that I do and that
is truly what keeps me going the
negativity that all social media
influences give definitely like be
number one down find out in this job it
honestly can make some days
so beyond miserable a lot of people seem
to think that oh your social media
influence or you make all the money in
the world you have all these friends and
you get to do fun things and well yeah
so that is sure I definitely have a lot
of friends and gets do a lot of cool
things and I definitely am making a
study and kama 817 which I am so
thankful for I would never take for
granted money it does not
happiness there is no amount of money
that anybody can the bank on that makes
a copy take it from me as someone who
has a lot more money than most seventeen
year olds I definitely still go to bed
upset many nights out of the week it's
just something you have to learn to cope
with and that sucks to say but you do
have a thing about the positive and
think about what you're going to do next
to get through it and how you been
handed to situation yeah Christine asked
how and why did you come out well
Christine I came out of the closet when
I was 12 years old and the way I came
out is definitely a little unique and
different to say the least so I plan on
doing a story time video about it
eventually please stay tuned I promise
it will come out just right now it's
still a little bit too soon but the
second I turn 18 we can talk about it oh
that's some weird I've been asked what
is your dream car by the way I love you
and I'm in love with my letter from
sisters apparel oh thank you I love you
too girl my dream car that's actually a
really really hard passion up until
recently I've never actually been like a
car person even still I'm kind of not
how do I live in downtown in LA I don't
actually have a car I've been everywhere
because I have my credit so maybe by
using my code
shout out to all of you for that but I'm
actually thinking about buying a car at
this summer and I definitely I'm looking
at a lot of different options but I'm
really leaning towards a Jeep they are
really really cute and they're not too
expensive either well apparently they're
also on gas mileage so I generally have
no idea but my dream dream car is
probably like a g-wagen Oh within the
next few years I will have a matte white
g-wagen in my driveway on my modern
California mountain home but as of right
now a sister is dealing with her ubers
their arms what did your go to order to
full line my orders are exactly the same
in a display all the workers at my local
Chipotle know me so I don't know if
that's like cool or really really sad
but either way my order is a breathable
with white rice no beans chicken and
then mild salsa lettuce cheese cloth yes
I know it's extra and then oh wait not
that
that is going to find upshifting box as
well anetha and drink for the road and
my total is 1589 sometimes they give you
the sisters discount I'm going to the
other eye off-camera really quickly then
I'll be get back and we can finish off
the rest of the face with more questions
I just want to take up anywhere every
time because I feel like this video is
already getting very very very long so
BRB so I just wanted to finish my eyes
off camera just to its take a little bit
of time so we continue on with the Q&amp;amp;A I
use the black liner for the upper
waterline and a nude liner for the lower
waterline of course I had a pop on my
house lashes ikonics for the lashes
today I just bend them together with the
benefit roller lash mascara a task
working with the idea of calling your
fans sisters this is actually one
question that I get asked all the times
I don't think I've ever actually adjust
it in a video before so it was like a
good time to answer I guess I personally
hate the word like fans more than
anything in the world I think it is so
incredibly tacky and ugly to call like
followers and supporters fans who I just
I don't know why I just really don't
like it sisters are she started this
past Halloween if you guys do not see my
Halloween costume I was a little bit of
like a dead deer type of situation it
was a very very intricate costume but
you guys know me I always need my
baseball hats on dorestad basically help
me cut holes in a lot of my other words
where so I could put antlers to it so I
could wear the antlers and a hat at the
same time loading me being extra however
nobody meant at all
but I was super super appreciative over
than any little photo to get out of
nowhere so I was like damn super
impressed and when he handed me the Hat
I don't know why but I said thank you
sister Marko don't know where it came
from don't know like why it came out of
my mouth because I had never like said I
before but and then I was thinking like
what should I calm and followers because
I hate the wife and then I was like you
know what I already called my best
friends which amazing with my family
Fitzer so why not call and you guys
sisters as well just be sounds like and
like to look at you guys and kind of
like
family and close friends as well so
that's why we're all sisters Anne Tolley
said if you were going to go to college
what would you study this is a great
fish that I actually get off all the
time and it's honestly something that
I'm not really quite sure the answer on
what I was applying to colleges and
looking at colleges I was looking at
different majors and specifically like
marketing and social media stuff common
thing I wanted to do something that was
going to be a focus towards stuff that
was going to help me with my career
later on but honestly a lot of the class
I was looking at the different school
seem very very early I'll date it and
just seemed like they weren't going to
be very much helpful basically however
once who I felt like lessons that they
had in their social media marketing
class and the moment basically told me
one of the main things that they focus
on is like finding your target audience
which yes is a very important part of
marketing and to like well one of the
biggest options we learned is how to
find your age group so basically if
you're going to be targeting older
people you want to go on Facebook and if
you want to get the young kids you're
going to want to go on Instagram and I
was like there's a lesson on that and
she's like yeah it's a huge part of the
program when I heard that for the first
time that is when I knew that college
definitely it was not going to be for me
I definitely do not claim to be an
expert at anything and I believed there
was always so much to learn but I am
definitely a very very hands-on person
taking class on a concept that I've
literally known and understood
environment executing throughout my
social media career says like age 7 when
I ran a Club Penguin blog should not be
a lesson that I need to take in a
college setting where I'm paying several
several several several several thousand
dollars my parents money that they don't
even have in the first place so at that
point it was like a unanimous decision
between my family that college definite
was not going to be for me and they were
on board and now I'm here in Los Angeles
and I'm learning more every single day
being like Anza and doing stuff like
that and marketing every single day was
my manager that I would ever learn in a
college classroom setting so I feel like
I definitely made the right decision
definitely look into it and definitely
do a lot of good research before you
make the decision as well because I
believe education is super SuperDuper
important I graduated high school a
super high average and I was very proud
of it but I definitely think it was
right for me
my family - I'm not intending on it but
definitely do some research and decide
what's best for your situation for
however today I'm going to pop on the
Eclipse highlighter from jeffree star
cosmetics this is an acai berries with
many other UI I am so fricking I am a oh
my god
oh wow hey hello a club how are you
doing today
the no for the lips today I was
virtually planning on this one from
Anastasio which now looking at it on the
camera would look really pretty so I
really hope that I don't regret this but
I'm going to go to the Anasazi a lip
palette today I'm going to custom mix
the color somebody mixing the shade
primary five which is blue with primary
one which is white and then a little bit
of nine which is purple making a
periwinkle color this is a combination
of the three colors that I'm going to go
for today I hope that I don't regret
this but I guess let's go ahead and put
on okay I really like this color this
would have been a really good
alternative oh well just edit off this
look of course I'm going to set my
safety to my Urban Decay oils like
setting spray and then use my pillow I'm
just going to dried out settings right
into my face to lock everything in place
and to just make everything kind of melt
into the skin and finally Zoe asked
