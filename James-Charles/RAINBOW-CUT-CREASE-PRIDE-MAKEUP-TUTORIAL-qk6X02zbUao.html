James Harold here and welcome back to my
youtube channel so this past weekend
here in Los Angeles was the annual Pride
Parade I am so honored and proud to be
part of the LGBTQ community it is such
an amazing place to be but unfortunately
I do not get to actually go to the
parade as you guys know I did just moved
to Los Angeles and I was so looking
forward to going to the first time up I
love that I've never actually been to
one before so I was so pumped toward
like some glam makeup and meet up some
of you guys but I had something a little
bit more important to do that weekend I
was actually shooting a very very
exciting campaign commercial that I
cannot talk to you guys about just yet
but I promise you Lee finding out very
very soon that being said however it was
a prior to beit's commercial and I was
wearing this looks for the shooting I
posted on Instagram and snapchat so many
of you guys are crazy over the drain
bolt cut crease prime and plan look I
have done this a couple total of five
times out and after number four on the
set for the commercial I loaded to be
this thing I would never ever ever do a
rainbow cut crease ever again but so
many do guys asked for tutorial on this
and was something that was very very
hard to explain this is definitely a
very very intricate look so I figured
let me just suck it up put it back on
for the fifth and final time and so most
frickin tutorial that being said this
book is definitely not being too Singh
in the world it's definitely pretty
tricky and extravagant I definitely just
going to James tutorial mode and teach
you guys the little techniques and
tricks that I use to get this look so if
you want to see how to created this
rainbow prior to cut crease make sure
you keep on watching all right babes
concerning out of my face and eye brows
already completely caught and done this
look is very very focused on the eye
region obviously so I don't want to take
too long on the base I just use my
makeup ever ultra HD stick and then my
turn shape tape as always my Laura
Mercier and my benefit brenell product
so just a normal routine like always
every single video and now let's just go
ahead and move right on with the eyes
and get into the glare I already went
ahead in five hours using some concealer
and then some loose powder and the first
time I'm going to go up in flame or be
35 B palette of course any ways that you
can use code Jase or 10% off your
project
the top is my all-time favorite develop
that I used to Michael
but you can see image very very used and
damaged but as my holy grail and I'm
gonna start with angle brush as you
system to feel ashamed or down in the
bottom to start sketching out my cream
so you would go for my pop creeps I do
deduct a little bit of a strange way and
as I sketch out of the crease first and
then come with the shadows and went up
or capture this is not a very very
common technique but it's what works
best on me
so follow it don't follow it that's on
you to decide to start YouTube you this
is just a mile of concrete I hope this
works really well for me just because it
gives me a really really good a
guideline when it comes to the concealer
I can just super easily cut it right in
half and I don't have to really worry
about like shaving or anything like that
I don't know this is my personal favor
and then I'm going to use the same exact
brush and I'm going to dip into the
orange shade and kind of place are into
the middle of the cut crease and then
that there's our brush dipping right
into the red
I've been finally winging out using the
bright pink shade when I sketch out my
countries and you can see I do a little
bit of hooded eye so I look straight
forward at the camera there's not much
actual lid space that you can see so
when I draw back Satan I really like to
go above my natural crease so when I
look forward you can still do pretty
much all the cut crease this is once
again my style you don't have to do this
I know a lot of people like to put their
countries in their actual crazy semen as
a cut crease you get what I'm saying
put your damn creature ever you want it
personally I prefer to draw above the
crease in my field this gives the best
result but once again you do you
next I'm going to go away I'm four three
three brush and dip right back into that
yellow shade and I'm just going to
really focus a slow rate on the inner
corner of not crease area nice very my
morphe I'm up 1/5 1 brush dipping it's
my Anasazi up blazing single shadow I'm
going to use this color and I'm going to
keep it out the orange part of the
crease I'm just going right in where I
drew that original crease line and
darkening up the bottom proportion of
dot 3 just to create a little bit more
dimension and then guarding a mother and
4-3-3 brush I'm going to dip into the
bright orange shade in 35e palette and
blend that out
next we're going to be clean morphe m151
brush again and dipp'd 20 jeffree star
and rajma color in the shade fetish same
thing with the orange I'm just placing
the floor at the bottom of that crease
line from before just to create some
dimension by grabbing another s33 brush
I'm going to dip into that red chasing
the 35e palette and I'm going to line
that out and then modeling with one left
and four three three I'm going to dip
into the bright pink shade and just
blend out the outside of that line and
smoke it out and those are all the
colors already on there like I told you
guys the technique that's super easy is
definitely my favorite I've been doing
it since the beginning if you have not
tried this technique to do concrete
definitely a ton of the 10 would
recommend just try it let me know what
you think at least I promise you will
not regret it but that being said as you
can see there's already a super easy
guide already drawn out because we
sketch it out originally but now just to
clean it up I'm gonna go back of my
Tarte stated to do it and I have a
makeup shock 286 brush and I'm just
gonna clean up that line I'm just going
to super carefully and below leave trace
and right underneath that original
crease line is being really careful not
to rinse it off because that blending of
already looking a bob a app and we don't
have to go around and redo it so I'm
just tracing the bottom outline and
driving it right to the inner corner and
then it was the new drug that concealer
is down onto the eyelid to stuff I can
feel it replace and just to brighten up
the eyelid itself and get ready for the
liner I'm just going to use the makeup
shock t-64 sandy white shade in this
every 5b and just pack it right on there
for a basic appeasement Kat Von D tattoo
and locket Lila this is my all-time
favorite winged liner
now looking at this this wing is
definitely way bigger than normal but
keep in mind it is a very very large
countries almost like drag style makeup
look so we definitely want to try to
balance without at least a little bit
when it comes to the line of the cuts
there's a book very very change of the
huge float on creases and a tiny little
baby baby wings so once again at sea
with this video do what you want but
this doesn't style that I feel like for
the fish of this book and what I came up
with
honestly this wing is ready to cut a
bitch I am living for it let's go ahead
and move on for my bottom lash science
today I'm first gonna start off by
letting my waterline is meet of Max
fascinating.i Kohl pencil
I love the formulas it is so creamy and
smooth and doesn't irritate my eyes do
you guys know that I'm really really not
a fan of water eye pencils I've honestly
been McKenna's get beyond that so
frequently but this one what is one that
doesn't irritate me and for this look
and certainly looks super cute to have a
little bit of white in the inner corner
just open up the eyes make them look a
little bit bigger a little more fun a
little tough because we are to be gluing
some Swarovski crystals in there too
something needs to really bring up that
lower lash line and get ready for a
whole lot of color for the first color
on my waterline I'm going to grab you
guessed it the morphe 35c
and whereas 4-3-3 brush and i'm just
going to dip into this sky blue shade up
in the top right corner on this focusing
color on the center of the lower lash
line and blending it lightly out to the
left and the right I definitely do not
want to take the shadow too low down or
else is going to really accentuate those
eye bags but I am being careful just to
make sure it's still blown out because
we don't want a SuperDuper harsh line
that is boys against the rules when it
comes to makeup with sister Jason I
maximally go back in with a 35 B and my
Sigma e55
eyes shading brush this is a flat
definer brush and I'm just gonna dip
into this bright green shade right up in
here and I'm just gonna place it in the
inner corner right underneath that white
shadow
out of all the colors in the rainbow
green is probably my least favorite
color so like I would say personal
preference I'm going to probably use the
least amount of green shadow and dance
look and I'm just gonna really focus
this right inner corner understand hot
pocket of my blue blending brush and
make sure that those shades are very
well blended together for the last clone
I'm going to go Miami 5 6 - its tiny
paper blending brush and dip that into
this is like a purple to finish off the
lower lash line I'm just taking this
purple shade and I'm putting it right in
the outer corner on the outer third of
the lid pulling into the blue a little
bit and then just pulling it up and out
and blending it into the bottom of that
wing then to finish off the island I'm
going to grab a SOR secret size 14 and
just pop her right onto these tonight
letter you just stop my last sentence
midweek yes oh okay it is very early
today I apologize I just popped on a
Swarovski crystal the size number 14
using a tiny dollop of flash fill in the
inner corner hmm I'm so sorry about that
now we're going to move on with the
lashes and for today I'm using the house
lost ikonics as always I always love
these for Christmas I'm just going to
put them here or right on then to finish
off I look on this way a benefit roller
lash mascara you guys know this is my
all-time save just a bunch of other my
fake lashes with my real one
alright guys Matt is one prize rainbow
cut creeps I all complete I'm going to
going to do the one off camera down to
save some time I'll be right back and he
said I shot the best top of the face all
right we'll be right along for blush
levity to be a massive dolly mix flush
of morphine okay this has no name on it
so this brush I am packing the blush a
little bit heavier than normal
today for James Trevis I am definitely
not my usual luck but I'm using a pink
highlighter today and for the commercial
that I shot before they really wanted a
very very intense pride lip that would
show welcome camera so this is exactly
what I did once again if you don't want
to wear that much blush you do you
sister this is getting so long I
apologize there for others now who do
you beat eclipsed highlighter from a
jeffree star in commercials maybe MUA i
freaking love this thing it is so
blinding pull I don't go lay out right
over top of that blush so it get a
little bit of a pink iridescent glow
most of all thing is how they turn right
onto the brow bone for a little bit more
glow up there then our sisterly I'm 433
and go right over that line between the
two just make sure that how it is not
too defined which is saying that I never
thought I was anywhere in life but we
just want to settle down Michael oh just
the slightest bit make sure they're
evenly blended between the highlights
the brow and like the red crease to
finish this look off where I lift the
nominees the over liquid lipstick in the
shade at Pasadena I felt like a nude lip
was it definitely necessary for the
slopes just seeing that if I chose any
bright color it would probably really
really unbalanced the eye look I did
want to like a red or anything because
senator be too much red or like blue you
get what I mean I feel like they need to
be the perfect happy medium between all
three and puffiness of my all-time faves
and you guys let you can use code
James for 30% off all over up products
as well all right into finish this look
off once and for all I'm going to drench
ourself in the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray if they're going to be
wearing this look to a pride event it's
going to be very very hot probably very
very sweaty and broadly very very fun
and celebratory so you definitely want
to make sure you locking your makeup all
day long

pride rainbow cut crease inspired
