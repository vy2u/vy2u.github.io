welcome back to my channel
gospel season is officially upon us and
I was so second excited to spend all
this amazing time with my sisters listen
to some great reason and take amazing
Instagram pictures like I said last week
video I know as tickets to these events
are crazy expensive and that's our lens
do a drugstore tutorial just for all of
these I found they're on a budget but
for this week's video I wanted to toe
back into a regular James Charles aisle
and today I created this rainbow 1/2 cut
crease pink glowy look using products
from all my favorite brands out there by
the way just looking it's very very
loosely inspired by one way all say
favorite horizon-- instagram use name is
barb Raquel she's like the queen of
festival season she did something
relatively similar to last year
professional season but I just wanted to
give her credit anyway because if you
guys don't know who she is you need to
check her out she is living the Queen I
freaking love her anyway he doesn't look
the I came up with today and if you guys
want to see a high printed it make sure
you keep on watching
alright this is also know for my base
already on this look is obviously going
to be a super duper concentrated on the
eyes and I guys like Kylie and contour
area so I figured we would skim out all
the basics as you guys image me do it 54
million times so let's get right on with
the island I'm going to start on my eyes
that are using this holy girl eyes
shadow palette the Anasazi at modern
renaissance palette if you don't own
this you are really missing out 10 out
of 10 would definitely recommend I'm
first going to get the shade a burnt
orange on my my 13 brush and I'm going
to use it as a transition shade in my
crease undisputed windshield wiper
motions but I'm really going to keep
this color concentrate on the inner
third of the face we are gonna be doing
a half cut crease today but the other
half is going to be transitioning into a
pink either very very complicated plan
for this look and there's a whole lot of
colors involved so I'm just going to
kind of be throwing stuff on there so
you guys just got to kind of follow me
as I go the normally share helps is
going to work
explaining why next taking me on 39 I'm
dipping into the sheet of real gone and
I'm just going to put this right in the
crease just create a little bit more
depth and dimension when I'm blending
this I'm blending very very lightly as
well because there are going to be so
many different colors and situations
going on on the eyelid region and I
really want to make sure each area is
very very defined and also blended out
as well to make sure that all the colors
don't get like muddy together and really
gross looking
next coming to grab my I'm at 5:07 and
mixed together the shade Cypress number
and red ochre and just keep it up the
very very inner corner of the eye I'm
going to take a little bit more real raw
on my r39 again and just blend over that
to make sure that it is not too harsh
I'm going to go ahead and leave the
crease where it is right now and we're
going to come back to it in a few
minutes but for now Vitter Godsey
Morpheus 35b you guys can use go to
James for 10% off your purchase at no
commercials calm you should know this by
now with my favorite holy ground palette
for all colored shadows I'm going to
Miami 514 and I'm going to dip into this
in Beyond pink shade and I'm going to
start the other half of the cream I'm
going to start to blend upon in the
outer corner and I'm obviously going to
blend right into the orange shade as
well being really careful once again to
keep them blended together but not
getting muddy because we really like
short each of the colors shine today
when I get to this outer corner I'm
going to wing the shadow I'm actually
going to bring up all the way to my
hairline because we're going to be
putting a whole lot of blush all in this
region it all makes them later on just
try to follow along for now remember
message is out of the way bitch there's
a fire I'm coming yeah next to thing
back into the mounted vendors on
probably clean and four c3 again I'm
going to grab the shade
love letter and I'm just going to use
this to deepen up the crease on the pink
side I'm going to Pat this color on the
outer third and we're also going to
bring onto the eyelid a little bit to
start off video blending and once again
I want to get to the outer corner I'm
just going to kind of pull it out and
wing it towards the hairline
next one member of yet another Emperor
three three brush and we're going to dip
into this purple shade and I'm going to
deep it out the outer corner I'm going
to wing this out out and then kind of
pull it back and right into the creek
just to create a little bit of a V
effect then I'm gonna grab my upper
earth review that I use level around and
I'm just going to blend into the crease
to stricture the orange and the purple
sheets are nicely transition together
and I'm also going to go ahead and put
the shade all over the lid just to
prepare for the cut crease
I'm after grabbin m56 - and the dark
indigo shade for the palette I'm gonna
grab my m56 - in a dark indigo shooting
the 35b and I'm just going to deepen up
that outer corner
once again and finally with that m56 -
I'm going to grab just the tiniest bit
of black cross your fingers and then
deepen up the outer corner just a little
bit or really testing or the with you
like I said just a little with it goes
literally the longest way lots of you
want to turn into a black smoky eye
that's next week's tutorial now we're
going to go ahead we're going to do the
half cut crease I'm going to run my tart
shaped teeth concealer and just put the
tank sit on two at the back of my hand
I'm just gonna grab the concealer on a
dose of colors I shadow brush and over
to carve off the crease next another
palette from Natasha oh no no I honestly
have no any windows called but this
palette eggs bhave off it is very very
close up so there are definitely several
alternatives you could use for the
shadow but I've ever accomplished 852 m
golden and beige on the same channel
brush I'm gonna quickly grab my are 39
and dip into a real barn just
whoa okay apparently I'm really going to
dip into real dog okay I'm going to a
blend that line out
then just add a little bit of pop on
house cut crease I'm going to have the
Urban Decay litter liner in the shape
Midnight Cowboy and just put a little
bit on there that starts the lower lash
line I'm going to go to this Tarte clay
pot in the shade of blue moon they just
sent me a huge PR package of a ton of
clay liners and these are Paul honestly
so freaking pretty so I needed to get
one of these in this tutorial I want to
have a little bit of a pop of color on
the lower lash line just to kind of
switch things up keep you on your toes
so it's a loser so I'm gonna put
this in my waterline today you're
kidding me that's so pretty here Oh
oh my god why not it's all going to go
to be a matte single shadow in the shade
electric eel and my morphe Abbott one
for my breasts no delay this right over
top of that tart clay liner sister
Callie recommended this isolated screen
shoot only one of her face so obviously
I had to put it into this tutorial then
I got to go back into my 10 4 3 3 that I
use on that purple shade and I'm just
going to blend out this outer corner
now that the eye shadow fortune is all
done I'm actually going to skip lashes
Justin right now that I'm actually going
to go onto the contour and highlight
portion of the base just to you that's
all going to kind of connect sector
going to be easier to just blend it all
together and then we're not last in the
other self
later to start off over there going to
be a Mac blush in the shade dolly MEK mi
amore feet are 36 brush and I'm gonna
start putting on some blush
and texting up to the eye shadow root
Jen you guys know that on this channel
there is barely ever blossom tutorial
it's honestly probably might leave your
makeup product of all time but for this
look it's going to be absolutely
necessary to pull everything together so
we're really going to pack it on today
this is hurting my soul a little bit but
I promise it'll look good at the Adams
of hopefully and then once I get up here
I'm going to turn on my blush a little
bit more heavily and I'm going to blend
it right into the eye shadow portion I'm
cueing the shadow of the most devoted
right in this temple regions by the eye
shadow and also right at the edge of the
hairline and then fading it out as we
get towards the center on with my face
normally I would do at one eye off
camera now and then come back for the
highlighter nested to face but this look
is going to be exactly symmetrical and
like I said we're focusing in this area
right now
so I'm going to be overall cheekbone
enhancer in the shaded cheeky a pretty
she was just a highlighter but thanks
again for it
the loose pigment and a penc so yeah I'm
also going to print out a little bit
with six plus four nice when we drove by
a very very cracked and shattered mary
lou manizer from the balm a little havoc
my brow bone and inner corner for last
today I'm gonna probably all fancies and
that will be hasta la psychotics shocker
for mascara going to blend in the fall
season library lashes i'm going to use
the benefit roller lash mascara and just
do a light coat all right surface and
that gets one side of the face ah-hum
completed now going to going to do the
other eye and the situation off-camera
I'll be right back and we can finish off
like the lips of them and guess up there
see right back alright I just went ahead
and did the same excepting on the other
side of my face and now we're going to
go ahead and finish off I guess this
look with the limp but let's the
revenues layer a morphing liquid
lipstick in the shade at vanity I really
wanted to go with like a really really
light pink I think it just suits this
look very very well now listed was
looking a little bit too quickly on me
and it was not really matching with
obviously but Pink's are but on this
look so I decided to switch it over to a
mixture of the over liquid lipsticks
associated Pasadena and Panama I like
this color a whole lot better and you
can use go to James for 30% off all over
liquid lipsticks as I said a million
times I don't know why I'm having a
store bottle when I'm over here as I
said a million times you can use coach
what the it's my favorite part way
too late at night for that and then the
last and totally optional steps just
like my last tutorial I'm gonna take
that part play later one last time
blue and a line of us are just going to
draw a line right down the center of my
lip yeah
at the last two finalists I'm going to
go ahead and set my face using the Urban
Decay oil slick setting spray this is
going to be a festive look as I said
before and the whole lot of makeup that
we have on our face so the last thing
you want is to melt off while we are
getting crunked in the field our
waitress and this is the completed a
rainbow 1/2 concrete festival look I
