outside YouTube channel for today's
video I will be doing something
completely different that I have never
done on this channel before and I'm
honestly so excited for and I hope you
guys are too in case you missed it I've
been living under a rock
Sigma just relaunch their lips which lip
gloss is that such a mouthful but these
lip glosses are like holographic rainbow
glosses I got and they aren't so beyond
beautiful they launched a few months
back and they took the internet by storm
everybody was doing a crazy looks with
them and they sold out and have not been
available set it's been like 3 or 4
months but they finally just relaunched
a few days ago and now I got my hands on
all 4 of the shape as soon as I got
these I was so freaking excited and my
first instinct was obviously to open
them right up and do some swatches over
on snapchat and if you don't follow me
I'll stop you definitely share using is
James Xiao Lin extra ask dr. Charles I
would do PR on boxes and opening
American when I'd give products like
these they're always getting swatched as
soon as I got these in swass if I wanted
to do a look so so badly because they
were so cool so fusions it's like black
smokey eye glossy lid and rainbow lips
situation closed on incident and you
guys went crazy over it I got so many
comments and so many requests to film a
video on this look and reality it's
literally just a black lip and black
smokey eye with a sauce over top anybody
can do that it's just the gloss I guess
it of the cool part so instead of being
like a Detroit because I feel like
that's boring it's super super easy I
want to feel like I fell on type of like
review suave simple situations and then
I'll Porsche you how I created the lips
from the look but well the eye part is
so much fun and photographed beautifully
but it's definitely not some practical
wear at all trust me I was like blinking
and gloss and getting all the way I
lived after like three three minutes so
definitely would not recommend so I
figured I would just give up on the eyes
and do only the lips for today without
further ado let's get into it the review
I just hold up a single website right
now and these are the lips which lip
glosses from Sigma Beauty they are $14
each definitely not too badly pipes for
a lip gloss I know most lip balms are
usually like 18 or 21 dollars similar
place to look realistic so you are
definitely adding a few dollars off
sure it describes other thing as a
holographic lip glosses that of
prismatic lightweight and adding
dimensional new layer to your favorite
lip color these lips which lip glosses
come in four different shades the first
one is called lip flop in this lens or
on telegraphic the next lips which is
called pink loaded and is basically pink
holographic next one is called a
transcend and it is this blue
holographic law and the last one is
called double whammy and it is a purple
blue green Treo Pro love gloss type of
situation so those are all four shades
washed onto the skin and I don't really
know how these are going to show up on
camera looking at the monitor you can't
really tell how actually holographic in
here doesn't they look and person they
are so beautiful I'm really color
changing I'm really really hoping that
it looks okay on the footage but anyways
also hopes to it does statistic losses
books D clueless will know they're over
a dark liquid lipstick and of course
they have a nude on right now but we'd
go ahead and remove this and replace it
with a flat but then do some coral lips
bottoms on the actual lips I'm going to
show you guys have created that oil
spell off that I posted on the
instagrams everybody was crazy over it
is such a cool look so let's go ahead
and take this little books off and I'll
show you guys what these classes can
really do all right so this one I hadn't
applied my favorite black liquid
lipstick I use jeffree star a weirdo for
this particular day and I'm not going to
go to these losses and create this oil
slick the first I'm going to go is
double whammy and this is the purpley
blue green holographic one honestly for
one this is probably my least favorite
up before I feel like it's pigmented it
doesn't really show off as well but it
does like a good transition color to
kind of blend all the other ones
together and help create those inner
colors like the orange and the green I'm
going to do this one first when I go to
apply this I'm going to kind of tap it
on her way
oh there we go I'm not going to go into
pink load it and put this on at the
outer corner once again same situation
grabbing a lot of gloss on there I'm
just going them super randomly and
placing this on a different earlier next
gonna grab the shade of transcend and
I'm going to land this on as well as it
for them this one's traveling my
favorite I feel like it's so moving to
then you can oh yeah you could risk you
can really see that on camera and God so
cool then I'm also going to go flip flop
and layer that on as well alright guys
and this is how I created the oil slick
lips they look so freaking cool I really
really hope that the camera is like geek
justice I can see on the bottom that
they definitely look very very involved
and person they look literally out of
this world
holographic rainbow realness being that
these funds only $14 I would definitely
say that these products are James
Charles approved they are so cool you
definitely do not need to wear all forms
of soft over a black lipstick like I am
these do look really really cool on
their own and come look really really
great over a nude lip or any other
colored lip you might have sitting in
your drawer there's so many cool
combinations that you could try out with
these so if you get that make sure send
me pictures and tweet me all your pin
combinations I would love to see your
