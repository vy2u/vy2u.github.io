to my youtube channel as you guys can
see I'm looking a little bit different
today my hair is not moved up like it
usually is and I'm walking it backwards
baseball hat of course you can get a
sisters - two parallel comb for all your
cute sisters merch but I was having a
really bad hair day today I'm also
having a mental breakdown because by the
time you guys are watching this I'll be
in Australia but I have literally a
trillion things to do before I leave in
two days and I am freaking out but you
know what we're gonna power through
because you guys know the grind it never
stops work smarter not harder
well I feel like I'm literally live
recording a Penta fight I'm on YouTube
but it's going on since I woke up this
morning literally wanting to cry for
being so incredibly overwhelmed and
stressed out I thought for once I would
do say nice to myself in life and get
myself an easier video to film so for
today's video I thought we would do
something that I've actually never done
on the channel before and I'm really not
gonna lie a little bit sister spooked
Magoo's when i've never actually talked
about on camera before if that before I
was a beauty channel here on YouTube I
was convinced that I was gonna be the
next big YouTube I don't even know what
channel I was I was thinking YouTube
videos for a good like one year they
were a comedy before I ever got into
makeup and they are all still up and
live on an old YouTube channel and I am
so scared I have not thought about them
or looked at them or watched them in a
good probably three or four years now
for today's video I thought we would
reminisce take a trip down memory lane
whoo that trip needs to be on folder
right now and reenact or not reenact
whoa definitely not react react to my
old YouTube video this video it has
already been it's such a mess probably
just like the ones we're about to watch
let's jump into it
oh look at how cute my channel banner
was literally so good oh my God look I'm
not even subscribed to myself mmm
fake about hiya my name is James Charles
and I'm 15 years old I live in New York
and I'm gay
shocker I love drawing doing here
singing interior design fashion
photography and of course making videos
Jesus I really hope you enjoyed my
channel and if you do please don't
forget to subscribe join June 30th 2013
and we have a whopping 283 thousand
views total this video in a seventeen
thousand seven thousand nine point five
thousand this one video has two point
six thousand views that is it I
literally get that amount of views and
minutes that is so insane I really
thought I was gonna make it big with
this channel so the first video that I
ever uploaded to the teacher channel
it's with my mother actually and it's a
four years ago it's called a vocab when
my mom good Lord at the club was sister
Chrystie I think I talked about this in
my beauty battle with my parents which I
will link right up here if you guys have
not yet seen it but I had to fight my
parents for so long to let me make a
youtube channel i battled them for years
and years and years and they told me
that on my 13th birthday
I could start doing YouTube and even
when I turned 13 they went right back on
their word and they just would not budge
and I literally remember making like a
20 minute PowerPoint presentation a type
of video as to why they should let me
make youtube videos and that was
literally the turning point that like
allowed me to do this in the first place
I was scared to check this out let's do
it I forgot that that was my original
YouTube intro
oh my god hello why did I ever leave
that was cute then again now we have hi
sisters what the heck I couldn't even
spell out my own YouTube intro
maybe I'm gonna be talking slow during
these videos
hopefully why just taking me 67 years to
spit out every single one of my work
it's oh my god it's been 36 seconds and
we've said like ten words total oh my
god
I just thank them for a hundred
subscribers one zero zero this is crazy
literally now we're gaining a hundred
thousand subscribers like every week
that's so rude hello and 2014 I said cry
that was an actual word that came out of
my mouth I want to die right now
what drunk princess 2014 meet my jolly
looked better at this video that it does
right now that was the ugliest
definition I think I could have ever
given in my entire life did you just
swear Wow we love a demonetised
video I want to watch the next video was
uploaded on this channel which is called
things that do during the summer it is
uploaded once again a four years ago and
hasn't whopping 7000 views and I
remember putting a lot of work into this
video so let's check it out and see what
the T is
it's Friday and you know what that means
new video so it's getting warm out and
people are pulling out their shirts and
sunscreen it's almost nice that means oh
here twice billy cherry today that is
literally so not true once again
relatable tumblr quirky lonely scene I
had so many friends in middle school my
mom would literally complain because
there'd be a new person over every
single day and you'd have to always make
food for them always give us cookies
after school always that have to learn
their names that she never could and
have to deal with all their annoying
parents but I will say the filming set
up hello cute look at the good chef in
the background the Lana Del Rey and
Lourdes drawings the little plant the
hanging tumbler light that do your
painting like aesthetic goals still
having it with the white wall clearly
nothing has changed so for today's video
I'm gonna teach you some things you can
do oh my god come on a today I'm trying
so hard to be funny like this is so not
funny because I'm trying so hard to be
funny why did nobody told me I wasn't
funny
let's read the hate comments I guarantee
there's no the top ones gonna be you're
not funny oh this is hilarious woohoo
I'm pretty sure he forgot the password
for this channel no somebody found it oh
my god haha you were literally so
hilarious
Wow really love this you're hilarious I
can totally see you becoming big on
YouTube this is all of your guys's fall
who left me comments in 2014 saying I
was funny why did you lie to me like
this oh wait this is satire okay at
least I'm not being serious about this I
literally thought I was making a serious
macaroni necklace I was a little scared
now it's not as bad still not funny
though
stop and start putting your strand
through and if you're really neat if you
collect the ends of your string so it
goes through easier now he's completed
dude you'll have the most fabulous
necklace you've ever seen I'll see you
in a few minutes of the finished product
once here we have a beautiful finish now
who's the worst today why video I've
ever watched in my entire lives
oh we have the eine kleine Nachtmusik
this is definitely demonetised right
that would have just blown over and
sucked me up mmm oh I'm scared as a
child Parag Rafi oh my god you guys know
how a lot of times in my collabs or
videos with Ian I always get comments
saying why is James mouthing the words
that the other person is saying I have a
really incredibly bad habit of doing
this because a lot of times it YouTube
videos you'll have to do takes twice
have you guys ever watched an unedited
video of mine you probably want to die
because I say a lot of my sentences is
five or six times because I was piqued
example a I'll have to say a lot of I
said it is five to six times because I
speak too fast we'll have to research so
a lot of times that I'm talking to
somebody else
they'll have to restart their sentence
as well because it's a normal thing on
camera and when somebody says him that
they've already said I have a really
really bad and also weird habit of
mouthing whatever I know that they're
going to say I'm doing it right here
luck
Wow that's where I got that problem so
they been going on since 2014
queen of scripted YouTube content I've
never even seen costo problem my entire
life
you're kidding me oh okay wait this is
good you're kidding you're dry thank God
for uber still doesn't make this funny
though the next thing we have is sexual
non labs it's from three years ago and
has a whopping nine point five thousand
views
let's who we have here so for today's
video I thought we could do something a
little exciting and a little scandalous
if you know what I mean okay so my
speaking is already getting
progressively faster that's great I'm
not as annoying an awkward on camera
making progress we're gonna be selling
out let's get started
so this mad libs is called my true
fantasy oh it sounds like me an
Instagram coming I need a verb present
ending and sucking hurt really curve
past tense
on Monday to yonce once again trying so
hard to be relatable Beyonce sweetie I
am so sorry still love you the most
was I not out of the closet I had to be
out of the closet right I'm just gonna
stop asking questions at this point and
just go color blue present and
slimy I really thought about take over
was apparently so funny that I need to
repeat it 5 times this iMovie editing
really got us good exercise now dog
clothing piece belt
Cokely piece again scrunching clothing
piece for third time straightjacket oh
this is gonna get real wild body part
ear canal clothing piece again ear canal
and lastly number of minutes
of course even 2014 James I'm still
taking any opportunity he possibly could
to sing my song in a video really
thought I was gonna get that recording
contract still hasn't happened for a
very obvious reason we're done let's see
how the story turns out one day
reenacting okay
gosh this is the madcon days this is
when i started developing my love for
cameron dallas and shawn mendes wow
that's a good thing to reminisce i guess
that night i poked about beyond saying
how would it be if we were slimy how
would it be if we all day your carry
guns
it's a tickle beyonce over to my house
he swaddled and oh my god
staring at her pretty kneecap the whole
time I asked her she wanted to come into
my room she looked at me quizzically but
she said she would anyways would we got
into my room she'd put her earlobe on my
ankle and said that she loved me since
we first met my home started to do
lunges and I told Beyonce the same
suddenly my dog went up and I asked her
if she wanted to see more of me Oh what
I know you all just heard that ya say
the same suddenly my dog went off and I
asked her if she wanted to see the less
has been there since 2014 to see more of
me she said yes she slowly unzipped my
belt as I unbuttoned her scrunchie and I
did her straitjacket
those ear canals oh she still wanted to
be monetized even 2014 love that the
morals haven't changed that is why I had
not kind of record deal yeah okay so the
next idea that I want to watch is called
things that do on the beach and this is
three years ago one has a 5.2 thousand
views I do actually remember a little
bit of this video and I do remember that
this is one of my hurt videos that I
ever made on the channel this is with my
best friend Kim at the time and we had a
lot of fun doing this we used to
vacation in Cape Cod together every
single year with our families and
honestly those are some of the best
memories I ever had it on my childhood
so this video could actually be a really
fun to watch let's see what we had going
on it and sister came call
not a thousand miles oh my god I can
still focus on the piano
Vanessa Colton really getting her usage
rights in this video
oh my god this is actually a good video
oh my god the clever cut of the words
god damn okay that was actually a pretty
decent one these are gonna be
progressively better and less annoying
and unguardable to watch I have a video
on my channel called types of people on
Twitter from three years ago which has
five point four thousand viewers I
really want to watch this but given my
current status with people on stand
Twitter I'm scared
hey guys it's James and today is Friday
so you know what that means no video so
if you're watching this video right now
I'm a sewer lady either have a computer
or a phone and you have one of those two
technological devices you probably have
a Twitter account let's get started the
first type of tweeter I like to classify
has the complainer complain name these
people are so annoying on Twitter it is
not even funny
maybe Twitter feed is just complaint
complaint complaint complaint please not
me getting deep in a video about people
on Twitter well it's going okay at least
I'm air
emotions what we got on our tests maybe
a selfie if we're feeling good or maybe
an interrupt we're in a bad mood because
I am part of this group other covert
readers extremely unknown being keep it
to yourself and I should probably take
my own anybody's because a lot of people
and get married when I tweet a lot but
hey you know it's my Twitter I'll do
what I want
I just complained for a minute straight
about people tweeting too much and then
recognize the fact that I have in fact
definitely a hundred fifty percent in
that category and then said Yolo it's my
Twitter loved me
oh god these people get me so heated the
people that get offended over everything
and feel the need to call you back
oh my god I didn't even know fake woke
Twitter was a thing in 2014 people who
my school say stupid things like how
dare you my great grandfather's favorite
color was blue and he thought over 100
30 I'm complaining about a tweet
tracking me getting thirty favorites Oh
sweetie you have a big storm coming
alright guys I think that is enough
videos for today and I think that this
little trip down memory lane needs to
come to a screeching halt watching my
vocab with my mom thinks they do during
this time when types of people on
Twitter videos were just very very Allah
I literally don't know who that James is
and watching it may be very very
uncomfortable I was not myself I was
making so many joke trying to fit in
with that like quirky tumblr awkward
relatable team aesthetic and it was
clearly not working for me I also don't
know what got into me
that led me to speak at one word a
minute whatever that is I may need a
little bit of it in my life right now so
you guys can understand me every once in
a while but like this is just really
really crazy that this was like once
online but it's also really awesome to
look back at this and see my growth and
see how country I am now in front of the
camera talking to all of you guys I'm
like thank God that I had a major major
gloss then we moved on to sexual mad
libs and of course the things to do on
the beach videos I
really really like of course there's
still a little bit of that awkward
tumblr teen vibe in there but I
definitely was in 2014 but I was a
little bit more myself I was speaking a
lot faster I was definitely more
comfortable making jokes and both of
these videos too were a little bit more
than just a regular sit-down video even
though I guess three years ago I was
clearly already getting bored with the
classic YouTube content I think it's
really cool to look back on this and so
see that even if three years ago before
I was even doing Beauty I was still
pushing myself really really hard to put
out cool creative content and I'm proud
of those two videos even though they
were definitely not the best I guess I
just want to say thank you to everybody
who's been here since day one and to see
my growth as a beauty influencer it's
been a crazy journey I also want to say
a major thank you to you if you've been
here since day one of this channel
because I know there are still a few
people left from this era so I'm sorry
if you had to see the stage of my life
but hey and thank you so much for
sticking around and growing with me
because thank God we have this James now
and I'm so thankful that I have a group
of followers that allows me to be myself
and be confident and not be some a fake
weird awkward personality that I wanted
to fit in with I get to talk fast I get
to put on makeup and inspire people and
I am so just incredibly grateful to have
this job every single day in my life and
I'm so thankful for you guys and I just
love you the most ever I really hope you
enjoyed this little reminiscing walk
down memory lane tonight this was a
little bit awkward a little
uncomfortable for me but also so
incredible to see you at my growth and
I'm just so thankful for you guys so I
love you the most ever if you're noir
