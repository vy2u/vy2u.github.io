back 22 channel it is been a long time
since I've actually sat down and thumbed
a video so hello hi miss you guys hello
to the most ever in the entire world I
am so excited for today's brand new
video I went to Starbucks this morning
to get a paycheck before pulling my
video today and this is what I received
this is not a pink drink this is a
purple drink and I've been toking on
these weird berry things all morning
long this is rude and they will be
hearing from lawyer anyways Wow I
literally cannot believe how fast this
here is flying by a holy crop it is
literally hello the end of June which
means it is officially summer
god bless I like to think not only God
but also Jesus for this and I am so
beyond excited for summer makeup looks
for today's video I thought I would do
saying that I did a few months back
actually but had so much fun doing and
that is really creating my followers
makeup looks I tweeted earlier today
asking you guys system your best summer
makeup selfies and for today's video I'm
gonna do my absolute best to hopefully
do you sisters justice and recreate them
let's have into the video alright guys
so I'm going through right Twitter and
literally 3,000 of you guys replied to
this tweet so thank you for the amazing
makeup submissions I've been getting so
much inspiration for this first look I
think I want to recreate this look from
Adele's makeup she did this beautiful
stunning glitter wave eyeshadow look I'm
gonna try my absolute best to recreate
this on my eye today and I'm a little
bit spooked because looking at it does
seem it very very complicated
I think I'll hopefully be able to figure
it out and hopefully do her justice I'm
gonna take a few different liquid
lipsticks starting off with a blue
velvet from Jeffrey's star and then next
again a little bit of Breakfast at
Tiffany's I'm just gonna mix it on the
back of my hand hopefully this will make
a really good in fresh color oh yeah
dude wow I need to sketch this out using
a really really tiny detail brush so
this one is the morphe m25 0 why these
Co chains for 10% off your purchase I'm
gonna try to sister sketch this in to my
eyeball that I'm just gonna kind of cut
out my crease using this blue
okay so now that I have the general
shape sketch on I actually am happy with
it I think so far I'm just gonna use
that same exact liquid lipstick mixture
to kind of fill in a little bit of these
ways and prepare for the shading that's
gonna come max now I want to start
shading it in a little bit so I'm gonna
grab my morphe m14 night it is just a
little fluffy pencil brush and then just
step into a matte dark blue eye shadow
and use this to start kind of blending
in everything okay it looks messy now a
second I'm gonna grab a lighter matte
blue shade and use that to kind of
diffuse over those edges as well make
sure everything is really a blended oh I
know that this obviously makes it look a
lot Messier but we're gonna go back in
with some liners in a second and kind of
go over at those detailed areas to bring
back the wave shape I promise
now that everything is kind of blended
out and looking absolutely horrible I
just mixed together that same a dark
blue shade and add a little bit of black
into it to make it a little bit darker
and I'm gonna go back over the top of
the wave to kind of cut the wave now I'm
gonna grab more dark blue and like a
little bit more block and maybe a little
bit of green too I don't know what this
look is going and try to kind of deepen
out the tops of the waves this is so
hard
holy okay so I'm finally at a place
where I think I'm happy you know this is
turning out so far actually never done I
aren't before I'm now realizing so this
is definitely a new experience I am
enjoying this but this is really really
really challenging but I'm trying my
best and it's a thought that counts so I
want to go in and out some more
dimension to this eye so I'm gonna grab
my NYX vivid brights liner in the shades
sapphire and then just a black liquid
liner I happen to grab this Sigma 1 and
add in some more shadows I'm just gonna
add in little stalks all around inside
of the waves just to add more dimension
and some color a variety to kind of
brighten everything up okay and some
black dogs for some more dimension using
the same black liner on the lid I'm just
gonna tight line up my eye up really
quickly just when I put on a lash later
on there's no
weird separation there I really hate
that just bringing that all the way
across just like that and then grabbing
that small tiny eyeshadow brush once
again this is the morphe at 39 and some
black eyeshadow and I'm just gonna blend
out the outer edge of that black liner
just make sure it blends and really
really see we'll see and there's no
awkward like little mini winged in the
side of my wave because okay actually
really loving how this is turning out
now whoo so I'm gonna grab my white NYX
liquid liner and I'm gonna use this to
once again do little dots but I'm gonna
try to focus the dots I'm like the tops
of the waves
I literally have so much newfound
respect for people who do these type of
eye looks I always knew they'd be really
really challenging I mean obviously
let's be realistic look at them but it's
not like even that hard to do it just
takes an immense amount of precision and
patience to things which I really don't
have very often so this is a test and
hopefully I passed okay so I'm really
happy how this wave is turning out so
far but in Adele's photo she has some
chunky glitter right in this outer
corner to kind of transition between
like the dark outer wave into like the
not glitter region and y'know I live for
a good chunky glitter so I actually
grabbed for were different glitters
today that I'm gonna mix together for
this look starting with this pigment
from peaches makeup called mermaids this
one is so stunning I have this makeup
over kind of a purple glitter in the
shade 0-9 I have their in your dreams
cosmetic glitter chunky in the shade of
purple unicorn and then also this one
which does not have a label on it but
it's really pretty I'm just gonna take a
little bit of the peaches and cream
glitter base and plop that right on that
outer region
I've been gonna first throw up with a
little bit of that and make up forever
glitter oh my god that is so pretty holy
crap then in the middle but we're just
gonna pop on a mix of those different
chunky glitters and then finally packing
a little bit about mermaids pigment
right on tippity-top
oh wow okay so I think that is the top
lash line all complete hello that is
literally the great way of Kanagawa
quaking I'm just gonna grab it once
again that tiny little pencil brush in
that dark blue shade and just finish it
off by defining the lower lash line I
think when I get to the inner corner as
well I'm gonna skip out on that inner
corner because I'm probably gonna draw
on a fake white one to kind of mere the
upper lash line I'm gonna grab a white
pencil and just fill in the
slide and then grabbing my liquid liner
one last time I'm gonna draw in some
tiny dots right onto that inner corner
for lashes today I'm just gonna pop on
some Lily lashes in the style Miami use
Co James for 15% off I know you guys
know that I use these way too often but
they are my favorite wispy lash and I
just spent way too much time on creating
this perfect little eye art wave look
and I do not want to cover it up with
some really intense lashes over case oh
my god finally hit that is one I have
this little wave inspired look I'll
complete I'm going to go ahead and do
the one off-camera quickly or actually
probably not write quickly I'm gonna
save you guys some time and I'll be
right back to finish off the rest of the
luck
all right oh my god I am back literally
that took me another hour to do the
other eye major props to everybody who
does I are out there it is so incredibly
challenging but if you just take a
little bit of time a little bit of
effort and a lot of patience and
precision you can get something like
this which is still mediocre at best
woo me is a youtube channel so obviously
the focus is on my eyes and I'm really
happy that my face is looking so I don't
want to add any extra blush or
highlighter today I kind of want to go
for a subtle base for once in my life
but I do want to add a really really
awesome lip to balance out the eye so I
want to go in first with the ofra liquid
lipstick in the shade the Bronx which is
just flock to kind of like outline the
lips then I'm gonna grab the shade up
velvet blue once again from Jeffrey star
and put that kind of in the middle of
the lip to blend together the black and
to make it not as dark and then over top
a bowl I'm gonna use the anasazi liquid
lipstick in this shade insomniac and put
that kind of in the middle for a more
seafoam pop and then finally to finish
this look up I'm gonna grab that
mermaids pigment one last time from
peaches-and-cream and pop that right on
the center of the lip wig okay I'm gonna
give my face one last bit of the mac
fix+ alright guys several several hours
later here is this wave makeup look
inspired by Adele's makeup all complete
I literally had so much fun at
recreating this look today
going into it I knew it was gonna be a
little bit challenging but I did not
expect it to be this hard I have such a
newfound even bigger respect than before
for all the artists who do different
types of IR because this is so
incredibly challenging but Thank You -
Adele for inspiring me to do this today
I had
I'm doing this and I definitely hurt I
doing it more art like this sometime
very very soon whenever I have several
hours of free time because this was not
easy but I absolutely love doing this
and I hope you guys love this one as
well I'm gonna go take a bunch of
sister's selfies so I never forget this
beautiful makeup look then I'm gonna
wipe this off and I'll be right back to
start the next makeup look today I wanna
recreate this look from oshkosh aches
and it's this floral cut crease and oh
my god this is literally so he was so
something I've never seen anybody do
anything like this before
once again we're getting back into the
eye art so this could be a little bit
challenging but I think we can
definitely make this work and hopefully
it'll be a lot easier than painting a
wave on my eyelid I'm gonna start off
with the jaclyn hill morphe palette
gotta get em 513 brush and dipping into
this mac and cheese shade right in the
upper left hand corner i'm gonna use
this to lay out as like a transition
shade in the shape of my cut crease
since i know your cut crease today and i
need to put some flowers on the actual
line of the crease i'm gonna place my
cut crease higher than my regular crease
so the flowers don't please whoa I'm
just gonna place these shades right up
here above the crease and blend them out
into this kind of like cliched thank you
and then I'm gonna grab a morphia r30
eye which is the same thing as the m4 33
and dip into
this shader right up in here it's kind
of like a warm tone pukey brown type of
color and I'm just gonna place this
right in please I'm gonna place the
shade
once again above the crease and blend it
into that kind of mac-and-cheese shade
from before just add a little bit more
dimension and you definitely wanna make
sure you don't bring the shade up as
high then going back in with that
original transition shade and the first
brush and just blending out those edges
to make sure that the warm tone yellowy
orange shade didn't disappear last I'm
gonna grab an M 506 it's just this tiny
little fluffy blending brush and dip
into this a brown shade of right in this
bottom right hand corner and use this to
deepen up that please one last time okay
I'm actually really happy how this
shadow is looking so far so I'm gonna
get ready to cut my best thing and I'll
grab my tarp safety of concealer and is
any flat concealer brush and I'm gonna
go right in and carve out the crease I'm
gonna be really really careful while
doing this as well because I really like
how the shadows blended so far and if
you've got too high you'll get rid of
all that shadow completely and if you
cut too low if you open your eye the
concealer will transfer so you have to
get it right in that perfect place once
we were finally happy without cliches
literally 30 minutes later I'm just
gonna grab a dense packing brush this is
the m22 for and just some regular trims
as a setting powder and I'm going to
pack that right over top of the lid to
keep that concealer locked in please
remember like this is any other cut
crease Otaki shadow onto here but I
actually really like the light tank low
that we have going on it so I want to
keep that the way it is
alright so now it is finally time to
actually start drawing on the little
sunflowers so I'm gonna brace myself and
I have a bunch of different liquid
liners that I'm gonna use here to add on
at different dimensions and different
colors and I'm gonna try to put the
makeup forever brow liner actually and
this is in the shade 30 and I'm gonna
use this to draw a little circles that
are like the center of the flowers this
is hard maxing one out into little
dimensions into the sunflowers because
you know how on the inside there's like
the it's like the block dog inside of a
sunflower we're gonna put those in with
the Kat Von D black liner now gonna grab
the NYX vivid brights liquid liner and
the shade vivid halo and this one is the
bright yellow obviously I'm gonna paint
in the petals with this one OH
that's a battle oh I'm gonna grab the
next vivid bright liner in the shade
delight which is the orange liner I'm
gonna use just a little bit of this add
a little bit of dimension into the
actual petals there it is the good and
fresh sister sunflower
okay so lots of Elia at least I want to
add in some leaves in between the
sunflowers just to make it look more
realistic like they're actually growing
out of my have cookies for some reason
so I'm gonna take the Carly liquid
lipstick in the shade
it's this kind of like really pretty
leafy green color literally perfect for
this look today and I'm also gonna mix
in the slightest bit of the Jeffrey
started liquid lipstick in the shady
quality just to make it a little bit
more of vibrant I'm gonna use this liner
brush that I got from my arts in Crosse
video and use this to actually draw in
the LEAs because I need to be very very
detailed and the last thing that I want
to do is mess up those sunflowers after
spending all that time drawing them in
okay I'm actually really happy all these
sunflowers turned out I think two leaves
really tied everything together this
literally looks like a little string of
sunflowers and I'm obsessed this was a
lot harder than I anticipated similar to
the wave art that I did before about we
got through it together I think if
anything the sunflowers could be a
little bit smaller I definitely know add
a winged liner to this look but I think
I want to do a brown liner instead of a
block today just follow along with the
whole like a warm tone of summer theme
so I'm gonna use that same exact a brow
liner to draw my wing now for the lower
lash line I'm gonna dip back into it the
chocolate hill palette and this thinks
that colors that I used before and just
follow those from right back onto the
lower lash line I went I got a little
pop of like gold yellow in the inner
corner just to really tie this entire
look together so I'm gonna grab just a
fluffy brush this is my morphe on 5/13
and dip into a bright yellow shadow I'm
just pop that right up in there and then
it's gonna pop a Goldy tone it kind of
sparkly highly it out right in that
inner corner to mix together with the
yellow oh yes oh my god I love this look
I just thought ahead and pop the yellow
liner in the lower lash line to really
tie everything together and oh my god
I'm obsessed
this so I just want to pop on a pair of
lashes to finish off this local once and
for all I'm gonna first quickly apply a
coat of the Mac extended play at mascara
just on the lashes so the lashes have
something to stick to and then once
again popping on a lily lash in the
style Miami I know you guys are these
all the time but they're super pretty
and once again similar to the last look
they're very nice and fluffy so they
won't cover up all the hard work that I
just did all right you guys oh my god
that is what I have this look all
complete I am obsessed without this
coming up so far I feel so beautiful
like this is lit oh this is a good
makeup day I'm excited
okay I'm gonna go ahead and do the other
one off-camera quickly and I'll be right
back to finish off the rest of this
summer inspired and luck alright guys I
am back both eyes are all complete I got
them as even as I possibly could my
eyelids are definitely two very very
different shapes so I'm pretty happy
with the final result but let's go ahead
and finish the rest of the look our
person will start by removing the excess
of a powder that I have left I'm gonna
get my face on light spread to the mac
fix+ gold light edition to really give
me a summer glow from within and to kind
of melt all of the powders together okay
so now we were glowing before the Gods
and I'm looking at my base in the mirror
and I feel like I need a little bit more
color for the summer look so I'm gonna
grab my blush brush and dip into my Mac
peach isn't blush and I'm actually gonna
for one kind of really dip in there and
just really uh nin a lot of color I'm
also gonna put a little bit of this
right on my nose bridge as well and I'm
gonna add in some fake freckles I'm just
gonna use my regular brow pencil to add
in some dots all up on my cheek region
for some faux freckles alright and
finally to finish off the slopes today
I'm just gonna pop on a nude at liquid
lipstick and then popping the Fenty
gloss file right on top as a final touch
alright sisters and that is this
sunflower perfect for summer look
inspired by a shot cakes all complete
and literally hello I am obsessed with
this look I think this definitely takes
the cake for where my favorite looks I
have ever done in my entire life I just
feel so beautiful thank you so much ash
for inspiring me today I had so so so
much fun doing this look but I'm gonna
have to say goodbye and wipe it off and
without further ado let's move on to the
last and final look of this video this
last look today is inspired by at one of
my all-time favorite people in the
entire world snatched by Jade he is such
a talented artist and I'm gonna be
recreating this look today at which he
just called the moon emoji and this is
like
sunset inspired look oh my god I am
literally obsessed I need to put this on
my face right now I'm first gonna start
off with just a like flat top fluffy
powder brush and kind of dip into an
orange e shade and I'm gonna start by
putting this in my contour area this is
what half of you think my contour looks
like on a daily basis anyway so
nothing's changing and I'm also gonna
sweep this up and right over my nose
then I'm just gonna grab another powder
brush and dip into a bright yellow matte
shade and kind of place this right above
that orange and blend those check out
they're going right over the highlighter
as well because I definitely want a
really intense gold tone i just like
jake has in his photo I'm gonna grab a
light blue with my really good and
definitely not overpriced Crayola brush
and I guess I'm just gonna put this on
my forehead oh oh oh god there's really
no going back now ladies okay and once I
get to this back hairline region I'm
really gonna pack the color on there
because we're gonna darken that way up
and put in some black which will be
great because that'll reduce the prints
of my five head and you know I'm always
trying to do that so can't wait I'm
gonna bring this down on the side of my
temple as well and kind of blend it into
the yellow and there were orange shade
while this is hard I'm also gonna put
this on my ear okay said all the way all
the base color kind of a laid down I
definitely wanna go in and add a little
bit more detail so I'm gonna grab
another brush that I'm literally never
gonna use the gun and dip into a matte
black eyeshadow shade and I'm gonna use
this to deepen the heck out of my
hairline well we love a hairline surgery
I don't want to get it right in that
hairline as well which I'm definitely
going to regret later when I'm washing a
block out of my hair for the next six
years I think it's really gonna help
with the full effect of the photo
oh yeah oh wait now I just want to grab
that brush that I use for the blue again
and I'm gonna dip into a darker matte
blue shade and kind of mix that together
with the lighter blue shade and just go
over those kind of black edges just
reach it to the blue it doesn't get lost
into the black and the blue is a blend
nicely together because I always tell
you guys adding black to any look is
always amazing and connect so much
dimension but it is a very very very
hard color to blend and sometimes if you
put too much of it on it can really just
kind of take away everything else that
you just worked on so just gonna keep
blending up blending and blending okay
so for the eyes it looks like take
actually kept it really really simple
but added a little bit of light blue
just in the crease of it to kind of add
a little bit more dimension so I'm gonna
do the same thing describing a same
light blue shade on my morphe vm5 13
verse and I'm just gonna pop that right
and they're not even gonna bother taking
my lashes off because literally having
the same exact ones and then just
covering another smaller brush and a
darker blue and putting that right in
the outer crease just for some more
dimension doing this look right now is
reminding me how much I hate working a
blue eyeshadow this is why okay so now I
want to go in and add just a little bit
more umph and contrast to this look so
I'm gonna do this using different
pigments I'm first gonna grab this
Inglot pigment in the shade number 112
it's kind of like this periwinkle duo
chrome with blue purple oh wow this is
so pretty okay I want to use just
literally the slightest bit of this over
top of some of the sky region oh god
that's a lot that is so pretty
oh hello on video it just looks blue but
in real life that shift that you guys
are seeing my forehead it's bright
purple this is so pretty
next when I grab the Tarte chrome
pigment in the shade at top yacht this
is one of my all-time favorite gold
highlighters it's so pretty look at this
ready
oh my god Oh next I want to take the
same pigment that I used in the wave
look earlier mermaids from peaches and
cream and I'm gonna put this on to
highlight to my face but in the blue
area to brighten everything up have a
little bit right below the brow bone Oh
what might on a little bit above the
brow bone oh this pigment is so pretty
okay so now I want to add in like all
the fun at pieces that really make this
a true sunset type of look so I'll go to
my next liner once again wow really
using this a lot in this video and the
shade white and I'm gonna sketch out a
moon in the center my forehead this is
bigger than I wanted to be no mother
I would love to know how you somehow
managed to draw on a crashing wave and
about 87 sunflowers on to my eyeballs
but I can't draw a literal half circle
and there's sin on my forehead
then there's gonna take the liquid light
are not in some stars all around kind of
the upper half of my forehead just kind
of keeping them sparse okay I wanna make
a shooting star here somewhere if I just
like this oh I'm gonna work okay
all right guys and this is the sunset
look inspired by my baby snatched by
Jake all complete I will say that when I
was picking out looks for this video
this look by Jake was by far the one
that I was most excited to recreate on
my own faith for this video today but
looking in the mirror now I think after
doing all three looks this one is by far
my least favorite on three looks and I
think it's my own fault because I don't
really like the way that I recreated it
today you know how sometimes you're
singing a song and you're fine just like
oh my god whose things that song and
then you're like oh this artists never
like wow you should have kept it that
way and it really like digs at you a
little bit on the inside because you're
having fun doing it by you just know
that it wasn't as good as the original
this is that and makeup for my face
right now
alright guys oh my god a lot of colorful
liner several emotional breakdowns and
three days later those are all three
looks all complete and I am so happy
with how they all turned out today we
started off with a beautiful wave makeup
from Adele's makeup then we added the
little sunflower cut crease from a scott
case and finally we finished off with
this beautiful sunset look inspired by a
snatch by Jake you guys I had so much
