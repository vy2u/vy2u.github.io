Charles here and welcome back to our
YouTube channel jumping right to the
point of this video because it's
probably going to be a quite a long one
if you guys did not know over on my
Instagram which is just James Charles if
you do not follow me come to the
Instagram sisterhood it's where I got my
start and I post a lot of a really bomb
selfies over there
but every single Sunday on my Instagram
story I pick weina really talented and
creative artists to take over my Ivy
story and give you guys a tutorial I am
so blessed to have a job where I get to
share my artwork with the world and
inspire you guys I've been having so
much fun with lurking and creepily
stalking on your guys's Instagram pages
and I have literally been so beyond
shocked at how much talent we have in
this sisterhood and I have been getting
so much inspiration from you guys some
of you guys are literally some of the
most incredible makeup artists I have
ever seen it but for today's video I
asked some of you guys to tweet me your
favorite makeup looks that you've ever
done on yourself and I'm gonna do my
best and matching your crazy talent
levels and recreated them on my face I
think it'll be really fun to see how our
different styles compare and it also
will be quite a little bit of a
challenge because I will say that I
picked three pretty awesome looks for
this first video I definitely wanna do
more of these in the future so if you
guys ever post our makeup books and
you're just feeling I'm so proud of it
please tweet it to me tied me I want to
see all your guys's crazy beautiful art
but without further ado keep on watching
it you never know your luck may be in
this video let's get started the first
thing I want to try to recreate today is
this one which is sent in by Rocio seja
if you guys do not know who she is you
have to check her out an Instagram but
she does the most beautiful colorful
looks I've ever seen in her talent level
is literally unreal you have to go check
her out she was with me and the benefit
bra competition so she definitely has a
special place in my heart but let's be
real a girl can blend and this is
definitely gonna be a really really hard
challenge one she tweeted me this she
literally said good luck sister so
challenge accepted so after looking at
all of Rho cos work I noticed that the
one thing she hasn't common with all of
her looks like the little stamp of Rocio
approval is she has a little star here
on the inner corner and I know that she
does this using a sticker so I went to
the store today to look for star
stickers and these foam glitter stars
were the only thing I could find this is
probably gonna get really messy and
really annoying but
it's gonna go ahead and I'm gonna pop
one of these right on my inner corner
hello
let's try that again well that is
definitely a way to bigger stars and
sister Rose here we usually use this but
you know what
so the colors in her look today are
obviously a rainbow so I figured the
best palate to use for this would be the
morphia 35b
it has all colors of the rainbow I love
this palette and you can use code James
for 10% off I'm gonna go to M four three
three brush and dip into this bright
yellow shade down in here I'm gonna
start by packing that into the inner
corner she also always brings her shadow
all the way up to her brow bone as well
and kind of almost blends into her brows
but I feel like I have a lot more eyelid
space in Rocio so I'm just gonna keep it
more concentrated towards the crease
region I'm next time I go to another
clean and 4-3-3 brush and dip into this
shade right here and I'm gonna pack this
right here kind of in the center of the
eyelid her rainbow colors are literally
always so incredibly pigmented and boy I
have no idea what the heck she does to
get her shadow I was like this I always
have to build them up so intensely I'm
gonna go back into this some more yellow
and make sure that those two colors are
really seamlessly blended together I'm
mixing to grab another clean and 4-3-3
and dip into this bright blue shade
right up in this corner here and pop
that right next to the green a few weeks
ago I did a favorite brushes haul on my
incertum stories which is still
highlighted by the way so if you want to
go check that out how'd it work might
insert it and go look at all my favorite
brushes and of course you get your
discount but when I was talking about
blending brushes I of course mentioned
the m4a3 which you guys saw was like my
all-time favorite brush and I said that
I had it 27 of these so many people were
like why the hell do you need 27 of the
same eyeshadow brush well I already used
three so far this is why our next to go
with a matte 514 and dip into this
bright purple shade and use just to
finish off my little outer V how did she
get her shadows to be so pigmented I'm
next to have a little bit of my Mac
select cover-up concealer and I Mac 252
brush and I'm just going to carve out a
little bit of like a halo eye type
situation next I grab this bright teal
shade on a flat PACCAR brush and I'm
going to stretch it with some mac fix+
to make that shadow super duper intense
and we're going to pack that right on
the center of that little halo eye we
just carved out
I'm gonna use those thing instead colors
I did before and create the same that
pattern of the rainbow just inside of
that little halo eye we carved out when
applying the shadows I'm more padding
and tapping them into place as opposed
to kind of like souping them and like
brushing them on in circular motions I
really want these clothes to be the most
pigmented they could possibly be and
we're gonna achieve that by packing them
on and then to really make that halo eye
pop I'm gonna grab the Mac reflex teal
and pop that right on the center I think
this came out like okay damn Rocio has
talent I did not think it was gonna be
this hard for the lower lash that I'm
gonna grab another fluffy brush and go
in with the bright red shade and I'm
gonna pop that right on at the outer
corner and then some orange right in the
middle of that lower lash line and then
going back into the inner corner with
some of that yellow to finish off the
lower lash line at Rainbow and last
certainly not least for the shadow
portion of this look I'm gonna go a just
dense packing brush from morphe and the
sugarpill single shadow in the shade
taco this probably the most pigmented
white eyeshadow there is this one is so
so so bomb I'm gonna dip right in it to
that shade and get a whole lot on the
brush and hopefully fingers crossed that
this foam star sticker works I'm gonna
pop this right here for my final reveal
I really hope this worked I'm gonna grab
some tweezers and I'm going to peel off
the star that is probably the worst I've
ever seen for once this is not my fault
I blame this one on the sticker and then
to finish off the stuff today I'm gonna
pop on the makeup shock lashes in the
style onyx I know roseola loves these
and uses these all the time
okay guys that is what I all complete
I'm gonna go ahead and either one
off-camera quickly and I'll be right
back with the finished roasty oh say hot
look okay that's that about one hour now
I am finished the other eye and I am
back with the completed look and I just
want to say good lord in heaven about
this was literally so hard to do like I
already had an immense amount of respect
for Rocio before as an artist but trying
to actually recreate her I'm a little
shocked right now this look is not my
best looking at the original picture her
blending work is impeccable her colors
are beyond pigmented and her crease is
so costly perfectly there's like a nice
bright
Shyne right in the middle and of course
her star on the inner corner is looking
perfect I think I got the entire look
the star was actually at the hardest
part but like I said blaming it on the
stickers I tried to outline it with some
white eyeliner to make it look a little
bit more defined but it is really not
looking the best major applause for her
and hats off because she's such a
talented artist like I said if you guys
do not know who she is or if you've not
seen her work before please go check her
out for a far far far better and more
talented version of this and yeah that
is the Rose feel look all complete okay
guys so the first thing I want to
recreate today was sent in by an artist
I follow on Twitter by the name of Ivy
kongu she is so incredibly talented and
so beautiful when she sent this that I
literally at guard I think I have a
really fun way to kind of put my own
twist on this when I saw this I just
thought it was so stunning the shadows
are so bright and pigmented and the
contrast between the shadows and her
skin color literally like so incredibly
beautiful so I'm gonna try my best to do
Ivy some justice and put my own sister
James twist on her look today okay so
I'm first gonna start by grabbing my
morphe m5 13 fluffy brush and my
radioactive pigment from melt cosmetics
these shadows are so incredibly
pigmented and I really want this look to
be very very bright and vibrant I'm just
gonna take this on my brush and I'm
gonna pop this right on this inner
corner area I'm really gonna press that
shadow in there because we are going to
be covering out the crease with this can
be a little bit messy I just want these
colors to be extremely extremely vibrant
I'm next gotta good with my morphe I'm a
4-3-3 brush and dip into this bright
purple shade right up in here I'm gonna
use this to put it in my outer crease
and shape out an outer V as well once
again I'm gonna start off by really
packing this color in there and pressing
an end to make the colors super super
pigmented and then kind of go in
afterwards and blend them together I am
gonna be adding a winged liner so to
kind of follow through with that shape
I'm just gonna take that brush and I'm
going to press it right in on that outer
corner to kind of create that v-shape
and then just connect it up to that
crease region just like that before we
go in and blend out the edges because
they're looking a little bit wonky at
this point I'm going to take a little
bit more of that purple on the same
exact brush and packed it on the outer
lid just to get ready for the base of
that half-cooked crease
looking at Ivy's photo she definitely
has a very very high contrast in that
look so to add a little bit more
contrast to my look today I'm gonna go
my morphe Emma 506 brush and dip into it
the black and the bottom
35b and I just a little bit of that in
the outer V make sure to not go crazy
I'm just gonna wiggle a little bit of
the shadow into the outer corner and
kind of pull it out just do your
slightest bit just to add some more
dimension and that is plenty enough and
I'm gonna go back in with my m4 3/3
brush that I just used with that purple
shade dip into a little bit more purple
and then just go right over that edge so
to make sure that the block doesn't get
everywhere to carve out the half cut
crease I'm going to use my steel out
liquid metals and the shade rose gold
retro this one is a little bit more
orange to him that I would have liked
but I'm gonna layer over top of it using
the Urban Decay glitter liner in this
shade grind to make it a little bit more
pinky I'm going to dip back into that
radioactive pigment using another m4 3/3
brush and I'm gonna go right over that
edge between the purple and the shadow
we just put down and then going back
into some more purple on the outer
corner and then like I said going into
that urban decay a glitter liner to make
it more ping other than that crease is
cut for the gods and all dried out I'm
gonna add a lilac liquid liner today
using the la splash Pro artist liner in
the shade psychedelic this purple isn't
as bright as I want it to be so I'm
gonna grab the Makeup Forever aqua XL
liner and this is in the shade I don't
even know it's the light purple and I'm
gonna go over top of that with this I
don't know what was going on here but I
was definitely having some liner
troubles I just finished up the wing
using that and Makeup Forever aqua XL
liner and then use some concealer to
clean up below it because it was getting
a little bit messy but for logist I'm
gonna pop on something nice and light
and simple which of course you guys know
my Lily lashes in the style Miami these
are like at this point kind of the only
eyelashes I wear but they're just so
pretty and they'll fit perfectly with
this look because clearly we want to
show off what's going on on the eyelid
but my lower lash line I'm just gonna
grab that same exact a dark purple shade
on my I'm 4-3-3 brush and pop this in
the outer corner right up against that
lash line then popping that pink shade
right on the inner corner to connect it
back up and then taking my Abbott 1/5
one brush and dipping into this dark
purple shade if I done here I'm mixing
it with the slightest bit of black I'm
going to use this to connect
the outer corner up to the wing I'm
really hugging the shade right up
against the lash line because I don't
want everything to get too dark and
muddy and then just pulling this right
up against my little wing I really want
my eyes to look big and have a lot of
attention drawn to them so I'm next I
grab my benefit high brow pencil which
is a pink like wax pencil this is
normally for highlighting your brows but
I'm pretty sure it's eye-safe don't
quote me on that maybe don't have this
at home but I'm just gonna pop this
right on the lower lash line to really
open my eyes and make them look huge
okay guys that is what I all complete
for right now I definitely have a few
more things that I want to add to this
look but I'm gonna do the other one off
camera quickly to save some time and
I'll be right back
alright this design back with the
finished look but I'm honestly loving
how this look so far sister I hope you
put little hearts right here to kind of
fit together like the whole love theme
but we're gonna take it one step further
so I grab these like little glitter
hearts that I found in my clitoris or
got to even have these but I'm gonna pop
a little bit of these right underneath
my eyes to be like kind of a glitter to
your type of situation I'm just gonna
apply this using the violet Voss glitter
adhesive and just put a little bit of
this right up in here then just pressing
those on using up my finger and then
finally to finish off this look today
I'm gonna add some heart freckles using
some different shades of pink and purple
liquid lipstick all from Oprah these are
in the shades in Laguna Beach Las Vegas
Panama and mocha and this is inspired by
a look that I saw Nikita dragon do it
she looked so cute so I'm gonna do it on
myself as well today
okay so honestly this look kind of got
real intense real fast I'm honestly not
sure if I'm loving the heart freckles
but you know what
I made the decision it is way too late
so we're gonna rock them now and I
finished off this look I'm just gonna go
into the ofra liquid lipstick in Laguna
Beach right guys and that is this
lovesick look inspired by sister ivy
Kong who all complete this deftly was
not exactly what I envisioned it
originally but I am definitely really
proud of how this came out I think that
the eye look is literally so sunny I
definitely want to do a lot more looks
using this like pastel liner I think
it's such a nice stark contrast from the
usual black liquid liner I'm honestly
like those looks really really bomb and
I hope you guys really really liked it
too and sister Ivy if you're watching I
hope I did you proud let's move on to
the next transformation okay so the next
thing I want to recreate today is this
one from it Mik drew on it hello Vicki
there he go Mik drew on Twitter it's the
next look I want to recreate today is
this one which was sent in by it Mik
drew on Twitter it is like this cool
toner a brown cut crease with a pop of
light blue in the inner corner I think
it is so stunning and so beautiful and
I've actually not done any cut crease in
a hot minute so I'm gonna do it this
look today please leave Nora my nose
baking as well I've had to take off part
of my makeup like three times now throw
at the point of this video to try to do
all these looks in one day this has been
a really intense but a sister's nose
needs to be snatched no matter what so
just roll with me here okay so when
Drew's look she definitely has like all
whole-tone Browns that I actually don't
have a single palette that's like all
cool tones I definitely need to get that
so if you know of any lettuce sister no
but I'm gonna be using the morphe 39a
today because I feel like there are like
few cool toned Browns up in here we're
gonna make it work I'm first nighttime I
grew up in Miami fine 13 which is a
fluffy blending brush and dipping into
this light brown cool tool in transition
shade and putting this in the shape of a
cut crease when I do my crease I like to
keep the shadows focused kind of above
the lid just for a more lifted and
really really large eye look but you can
obviously place your shadows wherever
your heart desires I'm gonna grab a
slightly smaller blending brush this is
the M 4-3-3 you guys don't have like
literally a million of these in my
collection that they're so good and I'm
gonna dip into this slightly darker
brown shade it right up in here and use
this to it to find out the crease a
little bit more I'm just gonna place
this once again in that same shape
following my natural crease and
pulling it out towards the end degree
that cut crease shape that we all know
and love to finish off the shadow
portion already on my m56 too and dip
into this kind of slightly warm tone up
cranberry dark brown up in here and I'm
gonna pop this just the slightest bit in
the crease I really like using this to
just get the slightest bit of definition
and cut creases and stuff like that
because you're able to kind of put the
color on and bonds it out at the same
time without putting it everywhere now
that we have the general shape and
blending on the cut crease all complete
I winter grab any folk harbors concealer
this is the max I like to cover up and
I'm gonna be using the Mac 252 brush I
just found this from Mitchell and Stacy
Maria I'm Ewing on Instagram and I have
been obsessed with this brush recently
and I'm just gonna use this to carve out
my crease
okay so don't do what I just did and
rush through the carving of the crease
because clearly this is not the shape
that we're going for today
I was definitely a way too confident and
that creased cutting situation so let's
try this again
I used to be a Middle East so I'm gonna
cut creases what is going on right now
okay doing this cut crease that I just
humbled me right off it has been a way
too long since I've done one clearly it
is showing in this work here this is not
my best status for sure but we're gonna
keep on talking and hopefully those will
come together at the end I'm gonna grab
a tiny brush just like this I dip into
the same dark brown shade and start
sketching out my wing just like a
regular wing liner I'm gonna pull this
right up out from the outer corner I'm
gonna pull the shade a little bit onto
the lower lash line as well just because
we are obviously gonna be putting shadow
there so that helps get the wing shape
nice and correct I'm gonna use the same
shadow too lately pock on the shape of a
winged liner and not making this too
thick because we're gonna be doing a
little bit into ombre waiting today
grabbing our original transition shade
I'm gonna grab me a small fluffy brush
just like this one and lightly go over
the edge to kind of buff and blend it
out so we have an ombre away so that is
the ombre smoky liner or complete but
clearly it got a little bit messy so I'm
gonna go Miami for three two you guys
know this is my favorite concealer brush
for doing under the brows but it's also
great because it's flat so I'm gonna
grab just a little bit more of that
concealer and I'm going to lightly go
over that edge and cut out the
there we go now we're talking since we
already went ahead and put a little bit
of that darkness on the lower lash line
it from before all I'm gonna do is grab
my original transition shade on a fluffy
brush and just bring that right under
the lower lash line connecting it up top
to that wing and just finishing it off
for the pop of blue in the inner corner
I'm gonna grab my morphe 35o palette and
just any old fluffy brush this one will
do this happens to be another 33 I'm
gonna dip it right into right here and
just pop this right in the inner corner
I'm not gonna put too much blue here but
we definitely want to do a light base so
the pigment really picks up that blue
sheen and then finally for that pop in
the inner corner I'm gonna go my mac
reflex teal this isn't my all-time
favorite glitter slosh penguins I don't
even know what this would be considered
but whatever it doesn't matter I'm gonna
pop that right in the inner corner that
is what I'm talking about oh my god this
is so pretty
I love this then I'm just gonna pop on a
wispy pair of lashes all right sister
status one eye all complete I feel like
for the amount of issues we were having
earlier on we somehow managed to pull it
together this is looking so beautiful so
far but I'm gonna go and do the other
one off-camera quickly and I'll be right
back with the finished look all right
guys I am back with the other eye all
complete this one was much easier to do
off-camera thank God I don't know what
was going on here but I think we
definitely pulled this together to
finish off the look I decided some more
glow and some more highlighter anasazi
yeah so Hollywood as always and then I
paired the lip with anasazi and Ashtyn
liquid lipstick and this is the
completed look inspired by it make
drew alright guys those are all three
looks complete for the day whoo my face
