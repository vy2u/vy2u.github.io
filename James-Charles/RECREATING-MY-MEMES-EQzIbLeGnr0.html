flashback Mary
flashback Mary hi sisters James Charles
here and welcome back to my youtube
channel so if you guys have logs of
Twitter at all in the past like probably
like three months or so you're probably
at some point seeing me getting exposed
honestly you have like no idea how fun
it is to wake up in the morning and then
wanting to cry yourselves right back to
sleep I've been seeing so many crazy
pictures of me going around lately like
not only have me and Greeks meeting all
of my favorite sisters out there but
also I've seen pictures of me doing
things I don't even remember doing like
starting an anime film urban legend and
apparently I'm like the lead role in a
horror movie that hasn't even come out
yet the internet is so crazy and all of
all these a wacko stories going around
lately I thought I would just stick out
and retrace some of these iconic photos
so if you want to see me recreate these
memes make sure you just keep on
watching I'm going to start off by
crying my face today using my benefit
Porefessional primer as always I want to
make sure that no matter how ghostly I
am my face is still look flawless a her
foundation today I'm going to be using
one of my all-time favorites and I'm
going to using this one from la girl
this is in the shade whiteout when
picking your foundation it is super
duper importantly pick a shade that is
exactly close to your skin tone
it's going to be so bad if you take any
photos in your face does not match the
knackery rest of your body
trust me take it from me sisters the
last thing we want is for our face and
not match our neck it's going to be
really embarrassing later on now that we
have the perfect shade match as you can
tell we still need to go to highly dress
with the face just make sure everything
is very very even and SuperDuper
sculpted so to do this I'm going to grab
the cuff on the concealer also in the
shade and whiteout will even sure you
get it in there we want to be super
snatched today and then once again
taking that same Beauty part of the coin
to blend it out that was the base is
looking super flawless I really wanna
make sure to set up to don't get an
increase this job today we need to
squeeze SuperDuper long lasting I'm
going to go ahead and set my faces in
the makeups ever Mike
- HD powder my burger can use code James
for temper solve your purchase at morphe
brushes calm that is morphe brushes calm
code James it is Commission FTC
disclaimer don't anybody think I am a
scammer up in here since my career is
ending I need all the help I can get so
please sisters make sure to use my code
and you the money thing with a contour I
couldn't really find an exact shade mat
so I'm gonna use the max English out in
the shade at Coquette and my morphe r14
brush to smash these cheekbones also we
got a call to our forehead I mean I was
planning on getting hairline lowering
surgery but since my career is ending I
need to save my money wisely and that is
not exactly at the top of my list right
now so we got to make do with what we've
done I'm showing as well I mean we all
know we're gonna face student later on
but - always like to try you know not
only have all the contours satin tights
I'm going to go ahead and bake my face
this is an absolutely vital step I mean
you really want to make sure using a
super good at powder that doesn't have
any flash back like I said before it is
super important that our face looks like
the exhausting towards our body we don't
want any embarrassing photos and I don't
know why that would even happen in the
first days but better be safe inside so
today I'm gonna be using me Cody or some
powders it is so great super super light
coverage it's like barely even there's
beyond us but it really does such a
really good job and there's definitely
no flashback as well like I said guys
only a super duper tiny back and the
next up is going to be to fill in these
brows to get them nice and on fleek I'm
first going to start off by destroying a
really really light strokes kind of like
extending the tail a little bit and then
I'm just going to really lightly start
to fill in and shape them next we have a
little bit more of that white I'll
consider from a top on D and just a flat
top brush I just concealed ended up
route it really like clean it up and
make sure it is super duper really sharp
and pointy like I'm ready to cut
somebody you know alright and that is
what I call an IRA that is so on fleek
I'm going to going to do this one
off-camera quickly and I'll be right
back we can finish off the rest of the
face now the brows are both done I just
went ahead and wiped off the bake now
for this look I will not wearing any
eyeshadow because I'm a lazy a non
talented makeup artists so just going to
go right ahead and move on with the
winged liner
those need to be perfect anyway like I
said before a whole just a Sunnah and
fix it later now different liners are
both done and pretty even I'm going to
go with and apply my favorite pair of
lashes today I'm gonna see how slashes
iconic honestly they're like pretty
iconic just like me I'll write another
CRS all complete normally next time we
want to highlight or but like I said I'm
a lazy intelligent makeup artist and
let's be real I'm just going to facing
it on later anyway so we're going to
move right along with the left for
listen they are gonna be using the
morbid liquid lipstick in the shade of
Sascha
once again coat gene to finish off this
super easy look I'm going to go in and
set my face use my la girl Pro setting
spray it is so good and it's super
mattifying as well the last thing you
want is something like an oil slick we
really want to look too matte as the
Sahara Desert and only like a little bit
is fine like a little goes a really
really long line all researchers and
this is the completed makeup look for
today it's just like a super easy light
beautiful glam now let's take some
photos and show you guys how it turned
out oh my god I can't even get over how
much those photos slay totally Instagram
ready that's like 200,000 likes right
then and there so since I love you
sisters so fricken much I thought I'd
give you guys a little bit about bonus
twist on this makeup tutorial like I
said before there's been so many
friction to me going around and one of
them that's pretty viral it's a picture
of me and the new movie that I'm
starring in there's a new movie coming
out called it it's written by Stephen
King and it is a horror movie you guys
know I love horror and I'm so excited to
announce that I am officially starring
in the lead role of the movie
- sir - child here as soon as the
trailered released little everybody was
feeding me pictures of me in the trailer
asking how I got the look saying that
they loved it so it does we already have
this basic Claremont I thought in honor
of the new movie coming out I would show
you guys how to transform from this page
you can look that I wore in the movies
so if you want to see that look just
keep on watching again first thing I did
while I was on set was take my makeup
ever flashed in my more p.m. 2:00 to
4:00 and we're going to draw on my clown
nose next to me to grab this morphe
brush and a little bit of this dark
purple shake from 1 through 35 feet
palette I'm just gonna start to add a
little bit of shadows to the nose they
wouldn't actually let me keep the real
clown nose that I use on set of course
they did not do it with makeup but so
maybe how to make do is what we had
click let me find one like I said guys
ker is ending here so we are definitely
on a budget we actually do get what we
got to finish off this koala today we
obviously have to change the lip color I
mean most clowns
don't worry lips but you know I'm not
judging but for today's look I'm going
to using the morphing liquid lipstick in
the shade nor fee once again guys don't
figure to use code Jam erases I really
