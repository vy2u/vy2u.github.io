welcome back to my youtube channel for
today so do I have something super fun
plan that I'm actually so excited for
but I'm still used to watch TV with my
mom all the time and the one thing that
I loved watching every single year was
award season I don't know why but
something about a red carpet just always
intrigued me so much and one of my
biggest goals growing up was to walk a
red carpet and now because of my amazing
job I pinch myself every single day
because at this point I feel like every
other week I'm walking some red carpet
and doing interviews which is so crazy
to me most celebrities when getting
photographed walking red carpet and
doing interviews like to look absolutely
perfect I mean of course who doesn't but
that usually includes a very expensive
gowns very very beautifully done hair
and intense glam makeup for some of the
best artists in the entire world but
that process can be extremely costly
today I want to try to get red carpet
ready full makeup full outfit full
accessories in under $100 I have my $100
bill right in front of me left it over
to the stores and see if we can get red
carpet ready and under $100 all right
guys we're here at CVS is gonna be our
first stop of today's video hashtag not
sponsored you guys know I don't really
use drugstore products that often I mean
my regular foundation alone would
literally eat up half of our budget so
we're gonna do our best to find as many
products as we possibly can here to
still look good on a budget
the first was gonna be a foundation I
heard the new Maybelline and Super
Saiyan
so bomb this one is $12 so definitely a
little bit pricey I'm stealing I'm gonna
grab the Maybelline fit me concealer in
the lightest shade this one is 7:14 are
you all right I know that Nicki also
wants the Maybelline fit me loose at
setting powder
I'm gonna try to save myself $2 and look
for the Cote air some powder at a
different store and oh that one is six
dollars however that is the powder that
created Basha Mary and on red carpets
you have to be photographed so hopefully
we're looking smooth so for mascara is
gonna pick up the covergirl soul wash
hair which I was literally the face for
hello that is me but it's $11.99 and
that is quite a punch at this point like
give me a discount or something I was in
the commercial to the provinces $10.50
the pomade is $7.50 and so is deep brown
shell
I do have a pretty bushy brows but Wow a
sister a family cannot have brows on
fleek I'm on a budget we're going with
this and said this is the NYX eyebrow
pencil this one is $5 didn't even see
her highlighting in contour palette is
$24.99 that's literally a quarter of our
budget
I don't know that attitude get it
together sister let's go for mascara
today I'm gonna grab B Maybelline a
great lash mascara that's one $5.99 and
I know the Maybelline is known for
having really great mascaras so we're
gonna pop that one in hopefully it'll be
a budget saver because mascara can be
crazy expensive it's six to horse for a
single shadow from L'Oreal I don't think
so sweetie
what in wild has liquid liners for only
three dollars so I'm gonna throw one of
those in there and then I also still
really valley
a highlighter okay so what we're gonna
do instead is I read about the blush and
highlighter do which is $5.99 and also
the contour and banana powder drew which
is also $5.99 so the tools together
equal the same price but I'm going to
put this one back
sorry sister elf I still love you that
way we're killing four birds with two
stones yeah just CBS and we have a bunch
of products our total came to 44
something and that means we have 55
dollars and one cent left for the rest
of this video not too bad but we did
already spend almost half of our budget
and that's just on makeup we still have
clothes and accessories and shoes I
don't know if we can do this guy that's
not looking too great so far away guys
we're on our second stop of sister or
Walgreens we only have a few items left
to complete our full autumn makeup look
today loose loose loose from Casper
$6.99 which is honestly not much better
than the one before but it is saving in
$2 and he's kind of look relatively
normal so we're gonna pick out these
four cities look at hope and pray that
they work see what I said Washington
will take our total is going to be
$10.83
$3.99 clothing store or less that's what
we need so at our last stop and say
which is going to be Friday and we only
need a powder and a lipstick left and
our total right now is at forty four
dollars and eight cents for mayonnaise
nine dollars for lipstick hello hello
it's lipstick seven dollars we're gonna
have like four cents for clothes
I built reproach that I got in the next
level we're at CVS oh we might obviously
have to go back for that
raucous CVS because apparently lip
products cost a trillion dollars each so
cream which are still seven dollars the
liner in the shade of natural which is
three dollars and fifty cents and the
soft matte lip cream in the shade of
Stockholm which is six dollars and 49
cents totally to another ten dollars is
gonna leave or clothing budget at around
thirty bucks
I'm really hungry something over there
and use a dollar sixty I on my budget on
that's not okay guys so since we're here
earlier and already bought a bunch of
stuff we have a nine dollar off Stevie
asked coupon since I bought oil CBS
member so that means it's ten dollars
and ninety three cents of lipstick and
lip liner that we just walk is now we're
going to come to one dollar in 7th ed we
love a bargaining couponing sister
extreme couponers is quaking right now
alright guys we just got back home we
finished our entire face of makeup
except for one thing and that is the
translucent powder i know the code erm
cutter is one of the cheapest and best
powders on the market but it's always a
little bit Walmart which we don't really
have a lot of so what I'm gonna do is
that is five dollars and ninety seven
cents and sales tax is eight percent so
if we do five wait nine eight times one
point zero eight we get six dollars and
forty-five cents and subtract that
problem the budget
3 34 35 36 36 dollars and 56 cents and
when you just get an entire elephant so
the one option that I have left that
they can actually be a really great
solution is Santee alley if you don't
know what Santee alley it is basically a
really long Street here in downtown LA
where you can get everything in the
entire world from fake makeup to Liberty
knock-off designer handbags Jorian
outfits for a super super low price it
is our ticketing really late so nice
everything is closed down I think we're
going to call it a night but tomorrow
morning we will wake up early it gonna
early start and go clothes shopping and
find holy an entire outfit from head to
toe only $36.50 see you guys tomorrow
good morning sisters below it is the
next day I'm up ready and looking
fabulous kind of tonight is our red
carpet event and I am so beyond excited
we have 36 hours and 56 cents left and
today we have to get a full-on look I'm
talking shoes shirt pants accessories
the full shebang in order to get ready
for this event and we only have a few
hours to do so hopefully we'll be able
to complete this look on a budget
a bunch of same shooting that everything
is actually really cute here but a lot
of the stuff is like literally taking of
the entire budget to be non of your
shoes that works to perk you but there
are $25 you find a paragraph they're
really cute but they were $31 we can't
get those the album only five dollars
this is coming to be quite a dilemma
comes to a renze of gucci and it's so
good but I'm not thinking that a
jumpsuit might be a really good option
because it's like two and one for one
price so the search has moved to a
jumpsuit that'll be our game plan
at least we ended up getting that
jumpsuit it was retailing for $34.99 but
we ended up being able to talk them down
to actually $20 even thank God but that
is still a huge chunk of our ad budget
that means we have 16 dollars and fifty
six cents exactly left to finish off
this entire outfit we don't have shoes
we don't have accessories and there's a
slave home too
there's a million shoe shops here in
Santee alley but almost every single one
of them is just heel like I've seen at
87 billion pairs let's play but I've
seen like three pairs of boys shoes
which is like fine I guess I mean high
definitely a lot of a good a pair of
heels oh my god guys look we just found
these knockoff uses for homie $15 Lilly
they're not even close to real as you
can see I have mine on right up in here
but they are black and red which they
match perfectly in my jumpsuit and I
would so much other have a sneaker then
a heel on because lord knows I can't
walk in here to save my life and I'd
probably fall over so these might be the
guy okay guys so my shoes earned nine
and a half ten but we only have a size
eight so I'm gonna see if my sister
could do a squeeze we I actually fit
them they fit I need these right now
okay guys we have our jumpsuit and our
shoes now and the only thing that's left
is accessories but our only problem is
we have a remaining balance of 56 cent
so we might have to go you dollars over
budget to get this perfect red carpet
look but I'm willing to do so it's a lot
we're gonna break the bank by just 56
cents it could really make or break a
look so let's see what we can find
not only we have bunch of peek at him
okay guys we just found this bracelet
and three ring trio for only 99 cents
that does actually put us over budget by
a few cents but I think accessories can
really make or break a look
we are an you sent over budget but we
did it we are super close to $100 and
now that we're over budget oh well I
think I have one last thing that I want
to buy before we go to today's law all
right sisters this should be a super
easy and quick jokes or makeup tutorial
today we certainly do not have many
items to work with so starting off we do
not pry in the skin that because that
was out of budget so I'm gonna go to the
Maybelline a brand new super state
foundation I got the shake lassic i
erase all I am praying this matches oh
okay honestly not a bad match at all I'm
just going to blend this all over the
skin like normal
oh this foundation looks amazing oh my
god how much what it's only $11 I'm
Chuck the one really annoying thing
about drugs are makeup shopping no
matter how good a product is is that you
can't actually test it out in store so
as you can see it this foundation
definitely oxidized a little bit and is
a little bit darker than my skin tone so
I'm gonna go to my next step being the
Maybelline fit me concealer and I got
the lightest shade so hopefully this
will help kind of brighten everything up
and kind of make it match a little bit
better I'm gonna put this right in the
center of my forehead and then right
under my eyes and a triangle shape and
you guys know used to be my concealer
all the way out up into here for that
really snatched look but more recently
I've been kind of focusing on my
highlights only on the very center of my
face it's a very Kim K so I love holiday
and contouring but I really really love
how it makes my skin look and how it
brings attention right here to the
center of my face it's got a cover of
the mustache you guys not even gonna lie
I am absolutely in love with how my skin
looks right now I am so shocked to the
core it looks so beautiful oh my god I'm
gonna go Mike oh dear some powder and
just set underneath the eyes today you
guys know I usually love to kind of make
a face and plays but I also love to go
in with a setting sprays and like a mac
fix+
in between at my powder steps to really
melt everything in and $20 for mac fix+
was definitely not in the budget I mean
literally fix+ bodysuit fix+ bodysuit
the last night I went to the gym was
never so I'd rather not go naked
oh you're literally kidding me so I'm
gonna temp to bronze and copper in phase
using what's left of this way while do
oh crap oh that is very pigmented maybe
because it's broken into a million
pieces can't forget to chisel out the
hairline of course let's be real though
the true test of a contour sauce
Broadway promoter is can it snatch a
sister knows I'm not not at the nose
contour but I'm also not like happy with
her she's like okay I'm gonna grab a
flat powder brush and dip into the
highlighting excuse me
banana powder side of this duo and I'm
gonna pop this in the center of my
forehead to bring back some of the
lights and I'm also gonna place this
right underneath my eyes and right up to
the sides of my nose to really brighten
everything up and further the illusion
of a pinched and snatched rhinoplasty
next to finish off my skin and base I'm
gonna open up this blush and highlight
our duo from Al I think this one was
literally only a $5 which is a snow bomb
and I'm just gonna play a both of these
to my cheekbones starting off with a
highlighter hello I'm gonna try digging
my brush into this and actually breaking
it a little bit to see if that way the
pigment will actually you know show up
oh there she is
okay I actually love how this looks I'm
gonna go with a little bit of blush on
an angled brush just to kind of blend
the contour and highlight together or
not
don't love doing this for some reason
you literally have to scrape the top
layer off of this I think it's because
it's a baked formula but the actual
pigmentation of the product underneath
is really really bomb and I'm loving how
my skin looks right now before I do my
brows my eyes as usual I'm just gonna
grab my damp Beauty Blender and
literally the lightest bit of powder and
just bake along the sides of my nose to
really snatch it in place and then just
right underneath that contour as well
moving right along next is going to be
our brows and for this one we're using
the NYX eyebrow pencil that's almost
four dollars it was literally the only
one that was within budget
let's see how this one compares to our
normal I think 21 or 22 dollar benefit
processing my brow pencil oh this is big
I mean let's be real we do usually love
a good sister a big tip but right now
this might not be very helpful let's see
what we can do here this brow pencil
supposed to be dark brown but its third
right coming off as like red on my skin
this is not what we need right now not
the worst I wrote but definitely not the
best I'm gonna grab my maybelline fitme
concealer on the back of my hand and
just a flat top concealer brush and
attempt to clean them up a little bit
although I'm really not sure how much
that is gonna help being that the main
issue here is definitely the color of
the brow but I'm not gonna complain
because clearly we have not a single
penny left to go exchanges or trying to
get a new one so gotta make do with what
you got honestly it really doesn't look
top out I'm definitely being dramatic
and the rest my face looks amazing so
far so I don't want to get discouraged
by it just the brows no next of course
comes the eyes and if you're an avid and
creative makeup lover like I am you
would know the eye shadow can sometimes
get really really expensive or really
fast for some reason though I was not
able to find a single big eye shadow
palette anywhere at any of the drugstore
as he went to I either found these ones
like white and wild is this what I'm
gonna be using today or tiny little
single shadows from like L'Oreal that
were like $12 each hello I absolutely
did not think so so I picked this but
I'm gonna do my best to create a soft
same look from it today I'm first gonna
go for tiny pocket brush in the shade
that says a brow bone and pop
right on the top my brow bone to give it
a nice little highlight and left before
I apply some shadow oh that's actually
kind of pretty I'll also go to place a
little bit of that right on the inner
corner to really make that area of my
face pop and bring attention to the eyes
I'm then gonna grab a fluffy brush just
the morphe m4 401 use cochise for 10%
off for all your future budget discount
shopping and dip into the shade a
transition right up here at the top tap
off the excess and I'm gonna pop that
right in the crease as my transition
shade
well that pigmentation is definitely
rather unfortunate I guess and they say
transition they really mean transition
because that color is literally barely
even there I am like dying to put a
darker brown in the crease to really
define it but the crease shade in this
palette is a steamer shade which is a
major major makeup no no you do not put
shimmers in the crease a little e-ever
there are barely any rules to make up
with that is one of them for sure so I'm
gonna do is crack back open my very very
shattered wet-and-wild
bronzer and dip into that with a fluffy
crease brush and use that to define out
the crease a little bit more okay now
we're getting somewhere
popping back into the little eyeshadow
pot I'm gonna grab this pinkish shade
called eyelid right on a dense packing
brush and pack that right on but I lose
oh that's actually kind of pretty look
that okay down I can work with that
this eye shadow honestly is not looking
back at all I'm kind of digging it I'm
gonna finish off by adding a little bit
of a wing using the Wet n Wild mega
liner this one was only three dollars
you know those days where our letter
just keeps getting thicker and thicker
and thicker because you keep messing up
and putting on concealer and then adding
more liner then messing up and putting
on more liner than adding more concealer
today is one of those days I really
wanted to find my lower lash in just a
little bit more but clearly we don't
have any Tarte brown eyeshadow so what
I'm actually gonna do is grab my brow
pencil from before and really lightly
and carefully run this right up against
my lower lash line to create a little
bit
dimension oh oh that kind of actually
looks good hello hack this our look
isn't even that bad but I think that
lash is deftly gonna take it to the next
level so I'm gonna give my lashes a good
and fresh curl and then apply a layer of
the Maybelline a great last that I found
at CVS this one was only $7 I usually
love Maybelline mascaras but honestly
not gonna lie I am definitely not
impressed with this one I feel you could
mascara it is definitely one of those
products that when you pay more you
usually do get more bang for your buck
but all time favorites are the benefit
roller lash and Mac extended play and
the Sun will definitely not be replacing
either of those anytime soon so to add a
little bit more oomph on my eyes I'm
gonna pop on these lashes from kiss that
I found at Walgreens these are in the
style horse and I got them because they
kind of loosely sorry Lily awry Marie of
Miami looking at these lashes if I could
describe them I would simply say that
they are underwhelming the actual style
of blush is literally so pretty and for
only I think they were six dollars and
fifty cents they're really really nice
lashes they're 3d they're separated
they're nice and fluffy the band is
comfortable but I would say that the
hairs themselves on the actual lashes
are too short and they don't make a big
enough impact so those are the eyes all
complete and that was definitely a
little bit of a struggle but I feel like
we came through I'm honestly a pretty
happy with these a result it looks
pretty beautiful so I'm gonna go ahead
and wipe away the bake it has been on
there for quite a long time now I'm
gonna go ahead and line my lips quickly
using the NYX liner and the shade
natural I really like this color it one
dose one religion by a few days ago she
used this one and she said this is her
all-time favorite so I had to pick it up
for today's look and it was only three
dollars and then last but certainly not
least I'm gonna fill in my lips using
the NYX soft matte lip cream in the
shade of Stockholm
all right scissors I guess this look is
complete normally you know I would give
myself a good spritz of a setting spray
but that was out of budget for today so
I'm gonna go ahead and change into my
red carpet-ready
outfit it I'll be right back to show you
guys the finished completed
oh you guys this is the finished
completed look particularly I have
something else hold on did I send an
extra twenty one dollars of the budget
that we didn't have to create a red
cover for myself
absolutely alright you guys so this is
the Braddock carpet both look complete
clearly I do not have a red carpet to
attend tonight but you know what it's
the thought that counts we have a full
look from head all the way down to the
toes and I'm honestly kind of living for
it not gonna lie it if we look in the
mirror overall this challenge was
honestly really really challenging but
also really really incredibly fun to do
although I definitely love to treat
myself going makeup shopping with
friends or buying a new Alfa or even
getting a new piece of jewelry for
hitting a milestone on social media if
you guys think you guys watch your
four-legged sisters are good examples of
hopefully on YouTube it was honestly a
really fun challenge today to shop on a
budget and this just goes to show that
you don't need to spend thousands of
dollars on a new dress or $100 on a new
foundation or to look a beautiful and
sunny and fabulous because hello I'm
standing right here
