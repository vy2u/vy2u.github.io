right now my say no violence I've been
practicing class watch it she and I have
a question for you yes this cloud but
like hasn't said that I've been looking
forward to literally forever because
I've been watching you and you too for
literary since you started like 10 years
ago how have you done it for the wait 10
years without like wanting to quit in
your life I do get frustrated and kind
of sad and burnt out and tired and then
I just like II or spent a long time on
the toilet and then I'll just like look
go on my Instagram whatever for like an
hour and then he's like did you die in
there and I'm like that is true no I get
really depressed a lot but then I
remember that I'm depressed which makes
me funny and that's why I am doing what
I'm doing your humor is so relatable to
so many other people because you talk
openly about like the issues that you've
dealt with in your past and that's what
makes people love you so much because
like you're not afraid to talk about
that stuff and like make jokes about it
which it's like awesome because it's the
internet right now is just totally
triggered and so upset about everything
so it's like really cool to be able to
like hear someone like you who's dealt
with a law and it's gone through a lot
of those issues that people don't like
talking about but can like shut a
humorous light on them
yeah like when I was a kid I had
many issues and I wish that people would
like talk more about it yeah you know oh
I forgot - oh that's me every time I do
my makeup I'm really killing it I love
are these eye brushes mm-hmm so tell us
this is what you're going for
okay so I'm going in with the Jaclyn
hill Beauty house by morphe X Jaclyn
hill beautiful one of my favorite
palettes out there honestly at the
moment well what am I gonna close - I
sister justice - I really want to go in
and make this shimmery gold work for the
look that I'm trying to achieve here
today oh that was better
no you put your thumb on the Fralick
gasps and you just let it go okay so I'm
moving on to eyes can you close your
eyes I got a boy we love a good blow so
what's more important to you a six-pack
or a good brain a good burger in a
million percent what if he has a weird
birthmark on his stomach that's fine
you're okay with that yeah so physically
you're not like the typical like oh I
only want to six-pack type of girl well
I mean that looks or not everything we
had much other have somebody with a
really good personality but like looks
definitely help
how tall are we thinking taller than me
I could never date somebody that would
be shorter than me just really kissing
purposes I think that are you so weird
also they come from the fact that like I
obviously I'm like very gay so like I
need someone to like balance me out and
not sin so that's like I think I go for
really really masculine guys typically
that would be like down for stuff on the
DL I just really want you to like feel
like the woman in that sense of having
like a taller like man let's talk about
deal-breakers okay only calls you sister
a million percent you want that no Don
okay I was like a dog star every time
something about such as me on a dating
app insist hi sis Tori instantly delete
and block them I want someone that I can
come home to and talk about something
completely different like I want to
close your day and have it be nothing
like mine right I could never do
something that's like similar to me in
any way shape or form
always farts like a lot probably
deal-breaker I don't think you're gonna
find somebody that doesn't honestly
after a while like no it's true like he
is a farty butt you have more of a party
buddy oh my god why am I good at this
I'm creating a iconic look well you
really are going
with the colors and I don't love the
trace of blue but it's not bad what's
like the ideal first day for you a nice
dinner an escape room a movie then like
cuddling after I'm gonna cry why are you
so sweet what do you do like at night
are you alone
yeah usually then are you just like
cuddling your pillows pretending it's a
person no I'm usually passed out what
was your guys's first day oh we were
gonna go to Cheesecake Factory at the
Grove it was - that sounds horrible and
we ended up at a marmalade cafe we went
to a really not great restaurant and
then went to the 99-cent store
it was a no target target and then I
took him home and showed him what
YouTube was cuz you didn't really know
why who are you saying that to Shane it
was going good I had an accident but
fine we're figuring it out if you can't
be one piece of advice you think that
would help to find me a man and what
would it be I don't think you should
have a problem I think you're confident
I think you're talented if you're
successful you're young yeah you're
attractive you know how to dress
yourself if anything you're just looking
in the wrong places like maybe stop
looking at the straight guys all right I
gotta try to get a sister lasean I love
that do I have to have like glue
did you know quickly want it I put the
liquid liner I'm gonna glue oh the
application would have been so good I
actually think mine is kind of working
out I love that attitude
I'm really excited is this fun highlight
that's this one right you're not gonna
work with a laugh
can't you go blind from that like if I
mess up that were a legally blind so we
don't love a wonky lash on one end does
it feel funky yeah oh this isn't that
bad - yeah okay well you're gluing I'm
gonna go in with a little bit of
highlight here godsister glow you know
put a little blow everywhere I like I
like glow you know we do love a good
blow I feel like even if the makeup look
isn't a hundred percent you can just add
some glow and it will like fix the
majority of it okay close your eye oh
God oh did I go - oh we love it though I
love that it's like wrong cuz it works
with a look
hello where's the lips yeah we both know
it's over there you are one of those
people who I'll see like I was on
vacation and I went to your Twitter and
you were tweeting like somebody thought
you said something or did something and
then you were tweeting about whatever
went out and I'm just like you need to
stop reading it or just don't reply
didn't care for me I've dealt with so
many scandals at this point there's
something is like going around that's
like talking about me I really don't
care unless
draw like I just had a scandal a few
days ago on Twitter where somebody
thought I said the n-word well
lip-syncing to a song inserted I'm live
and I shut that down real fast because
obviously I did it and I was not about
to let another racism scandal happen
when I've like fought so hard to like
prove to people that I'm like not a bad
person I understand because I feel like
you actually like really read all this
stuff I did like as a person like me
it's so stupid I feel like a lot of
people have started like on Twitter with
like today's society whoa like want to
call something out so bad just for like
likes and retweets and if you like
they're part of like something bigger on
Twitter instead of like really focusing
on the real issue at hand which is what
needs to be focus on and I think people
are losing sight of what's really
important people love drama people yeah
at the end of the day that's what it is
people want to jump on whatever's
trending yeah so are you not gonna line
the lip cuz I don't think I am
no of course do you wash your hands
after you go to the bathroom yes every
time pee yeah saying I don't wash my
hands I at least have hand sanitizer in
my little purse so intense are you
almost done shame come on I'm perfecting
my look don't be rude
yeah hi oh my god wait - actually coming
around you're I'm so excited I'm fixing
it don't worry about it all right let me
do my lip I need something darker I need
like it's dark like okay Riley I have a
question for you so you're like this
obviously changed dramatically within
the past few years yeah like you're
working and entertainment like we were
saying before and then all of a sudden
started dating your sister Shan join
YouTube and stuff ant well has the best
thing about your transition which is it
has been the best thing about your life
transition and the worst thing
definitely the freedom also the stress
being your own creator it feels like
you're never not working or not trying
to do something because it's like a
treadmill that never stops you got a
great way that's a little better but
then on the other side of it freedom I
don't have to be at a desk 9:00 to 5:00
I like create when I get to work he also
had his first nude pictures leaked oh la
so I was literally taking off on a plane
losing service getting text messages
that my nudes were being leaked
shit's how might Ebola scandal happened
oh yeah which is the worst feeling do
probably one of the only people that can
relate on that and he was on his way to
a funeral like trying to like deal with
the situation on the ground where I
didn't
service and everyone was like retweeting
my nude photos I was at a funeral right
like at a funeral prayers are happening
somebody's deceased I run to the
bathroom
I've been like trying to figure out who
did it and like how to get them down and
what to do literally people are weeping
in the stall next to me it was like such
an intense experience I think then I
texted you and you finally landed and
you're like it's fine they look okay
who's been the rudest celebrity you've
ever met ariana grande oh can you talk
about this yeah I guess have you ever
talked about this no this is everything
hello how are you this is Gigi gorgeous
the only bread it's everything I haven't
talked about because I really like
Ariana I just guess I just had a really
crappy experience with her but I went to
her show here in LA and that's when I
met Kim Kardashian for the first time
who was so nice and I posted a bunch of
videos on my story from the night and
the next morning I had woken up and she
had tea on me I was like oh my God thank
you for coming and she was so sweet and
I was like oh I love you the most ever
in the world to this day I don't really
have her feelings about it I think she's
so talented but she followed me and D on
me and I was like oh my god love me the
most ever like thank you and she was
like I'm gonna wish I know you were
coming think I would have loved to have
you backstage and I was like this is
right I feel like all my Skibo started
happening so I was gonna make a bunch of
really really angry tweets from her fans
are really mad that she had followed me
I'm literally four hours later I started
getting to be really Wow Ariana
unfollowed James like the rock gets what
he deserves like Wow love karma I was
like what the heck I checked and she did
actually unfollow me literally three
hours after saving it just too much
probably but I have messaged her back
and I was okay like did I do something
wrong and she lit he was like hey babe
like I just saw a lot of angry tweets
for my fans that I would never want to
disappoint them so I unfollowed and I
said that's like a very like strong word
a message to and I was like you have 100
million fans it's really disappointing
that you would like
stoop to the level of listening to
people bullying me just like appease
them but okay I've always looked up to
Ariana and I think she's one of the most
talented vocalists like of our
generation but I just really sucked it
like I was a little getting bullied by
her fans and instead of like just
ignoring it I'm like building a
friendship she literally could listen to
them and I'm falling which is just like
saying I think that's okay to do you
should have been nothing ignored it and
just kept him in here yeah like it
wouldn't been that deep that was a
disappointing interaction Wow have you
never talked about that wait Shane no
everything ariana grande unfollowed me
that's the title like most so I'm ready
that I like Matt through like my job
have been literally the sweetest ever I
think it's really cool cuz like through
like having a lot of followers online
I've been able to meet and interact with
so many who that I have looked up to
forever like both youtubers and like a
real celebrity so it's just been like
the craziest thing about me youtubers in
real celebrities because I get it well
if you really think one of the what
classifies a celebrity a sex date I
think it is the New Age celebrity I
think it really is because yeah if you
think about like I love Rea someone who
like makes a decent amount of money and
like it's known by the public and like
has people supporting that Emily
occasionally goes to events and like red
carpets and does photos I guess I want
to go through your contacts and see who
the most famous person is in your phone
I'm gonna set my side wait how do I find
contacts set my side - Oh yours is
changshan you have so many friends oh my
god shut up you know Noah Cyrus Cyrus we

today so this is after yeah all right so
let's see the before oh my god why God
wait what did you do if she popped you
changed species I just out under my nose
and my forehead you lowered your
hairline yeah interesting you're
insecure about that mhm
relate you made your face fatter I don't
really I always wanted that my jaw a
little bit in photos Wow you give
yourself a nose job
well that's the thing when I contour my
nose that the whole point of nose
contour is that you add in the two
darker shapes and then you put the
lightness on the sides to further that
illusion and nose contour is the thing
that only works in certain lighting so
like the lighting that I shot this photo
and it would like that's why my nose
looks huge I love that you made your
lips smaller it looks really big enough
alone for some reason people been asking
if I got more lip full recently and I
have it how long does it take a raw
image to a Instagram ready for like 30
minutes an hour sometimes I like photo
editing in my opinion photo editing is
just as much of an art as makeup is as
long as you're not editing on makeup
which I do not believe in ever right I
think it's like so fun like you can
really take a photo may transform into
something so cool
I'm gonna take a picture of your look
right now

gonna facetune it okay and that's what
