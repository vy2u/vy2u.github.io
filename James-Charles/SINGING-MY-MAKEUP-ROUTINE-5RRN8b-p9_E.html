welcome back to my youtube channel it
has been a hot moment since I have seen
you guys and if you guys saw on Sachin a
few weeks ago I needed a little bit of a
mental break for very very personal
reasons but I am back sister is ready to
slay and ready to go and for today's
video I'm going to be doing a boring-ass
makeup look that I have shown you guys a
million times before but of course
there's going to be a major twist for
today's video I am actually going to be
singing my entire credi process so for
those of you who hate my voice enjoy I
have my best friend in the entire road
with me here today
Anthony gardulla he's dominating my
singing videos with I have known him
since third grade so he had seen all
stages of sister James which I know he
is back there behind the camera with my
piano and earlier today I tweeted asking
you guys for your favorite pop songs and
Anthony has picked I think 7 out to the
steps of a makeup routine I do not know
the songs but he is prepared that were
already on piano so I'm just gonna go
ahead and start getting ready and he is
going to challenge me and I'm gonna have
to make up a song to the tune of my
makeup routine on the spot this should
be very very interesting I have no idea
how this is gonna go but we're gonna be
putting my songwriting skills to the
test which are absolutely zero by the
way so without further ado if you want
to see me say my makeup routine keep on
watching
foundation man and me cover everyone 350
