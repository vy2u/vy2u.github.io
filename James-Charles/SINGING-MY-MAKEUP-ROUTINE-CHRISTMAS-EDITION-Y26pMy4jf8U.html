welcome back to my youtube channel I
have a little to look on today because
it is getting a little bit chilly here
in LA it is the Christmas holiday season
I mean it's really not that cold but I'm
trying the hardest I possibly can and
this is the most Christmassy outfit that
I have so a sister is trying up in here
I currently have to get ready for a very
very fun video that I'm filming later on
today but the makeup look that I have to
wear is very very boring a look that you
guys have seen me do literally a million
times so you guys know when it comes to
doing those looks
I will never film them without making a
fun twist a few months ago I did a super
fun video called singing my makeup
routine with my best friends Anthony we
picked seven of the most famous pop
songs at the time and I improv my way
through them it was definitely
interesting to say the least and if you
have not yet checked out the video make
sure to click right up here and go check
it out it was one of the most fun videos
I've ever done and today you guys love
it so so much that I decided to do again
Christmas edition I have one of my best
friends behind the camera blade today
Gabe ugh you guys know her as Dee
soprano from flash back and if you have
no idea what I'm talking about
flash back cuz it acapella group that I
sing in music plays a very very huge
role in my life and I've been skiing
forever I'm definitely not the best at
it but I do enjoy it so for today Gaber
picked seven of the most serious and
most popular holiday songs she arranged
them on the piano and if you would like

makeup routine holiday edition keep on
