back to my youtube channel you guys
today I'm going to study a special gust
sister Sofia hello thank you of course
you guys I'm so excited to have a chef I
here with me today we're gonna be
filming such a fun video if you guys not
know who she is
please tell a little bit about yourself
well I'm a singer and I'm gonna be
having original music out soon so Ben
look at oh good if I always just on her
show on Fox called before and that is
where I first found her I watched a
bunch of clips on YouTube and I was like
oh my god I need to be best onto the
school right now we slid into each
other's genes we were already following
each other which was so cool I'm mr.
morning what truth is we hung out I did
her makeup for the four finale which was
so violet but we realized not only do we
share our huge passion for makeup but we
also both share a huge passion for music
for today's video if I and I are gonna
be getting at glamour together this is
gonna be a little bit of I get ready
with I don't think I've actually ever
done one on my channel before with
another person which is so crazy and I'm
usually doing it other person's makeup
but I have already had the chance
we figured it Forte's it it'd be so fun
to do our own makeup and also sing it
got a few songs while we're at it so
without further ado if you'd like to jam
out with us and see us get glam and all
beautiful and ready keep on watching
okay so there's abaya like we were
talking about you just competed on at
the show the for unbox yeah tell us a
little bit about your experience because
you literally are so talented and I
watched every single episode I was so
ready for each week to watch us play how
was that it was pretty intense
it was a lot of hard work overall it was
really good and like I learned a lot and
it definitely like gave me a really good
start for my career because I got a lot
of exposure on the show and I've gained
a lot of awesome fans that just gives me
like you know somewhere to start when it
comes to making my own music and being
able to like release that to the table
million percent well I was gonna ask you
you are 17 now but you started competing
on the show when you were 16
yeah and I just wanted to ask you what
was that like to go from literally being
just a normal everyday Girl dolls and
having millions
it's cuz the same weapon to me when hind
side with covergirl yeah it became this
huge world why things I feel like we can
totally believe them yeah definitely a
lot how was your experience with that
um I mean for me it was overwhelming
because like I think it was when the
first episode aired my followers like
went up like crazy like instantly now
just like whoa what the heck super fast
yeah but it was just insane to see like
how many people were like super
supported I can just be myself and be
all like loved that you know you could
not have said it any better I definitely
think I have a small face No thank you
drinking you down okay sisters about I
have a question for you as we face it's
in place what like got you into music in
the first days or when did you really
start like singing I've been singing
ever since I could remember I've always
been around music my mom she was in a
metal band I didn't even know that know
what yeah and then my dad also does
music - so basically like I'm just
literally everybody my family's toned
off including me sometimes gonna set her
in place real good and fresh you
actually rock like really good makeup
looks all the time which is so cool so
have you been like doing makeup for a
while - oh my god yes I've been wearing
makeup ever since I was in second grade
I love that you know because I feel like
it's important to express yourself
yeah not care whether people think you
didn't need it or no yeah just to
expression because Sam I thought it was
cool it's definitely something that I
enjoy doing every day because it's fine
it is I thought one of the coolest
things in the world was when I did your
makeup for the finale I was like what
kind of look do we want and you
literally turned to me and said you're
talented please do something crazy like
give me Drive makeup and I was like oh
honey
as an artist like you respected me as an
artist and yeah something really really
dope and I just thought that's one of
the great that was good and fresh I'm aa
watching favorite a couple feet ever
worn I did like a green cut crease but
then like on the lid I did like gold
glitter Oh Patrick stained the
leprechauns are shaking okay so I want
to know if you could collab with one
person for a song or for like a copper
who would it be and why that's really
hard one person
I think one of them is posing along my
name is both Malone and other is Dino no
Jessie dude I love her I feel like she's
one of the most underrated artists of
all time she is so good and nobody
appreciates her I think she's so
talented
I'm so glad you decide no buddy even
things out her she is so great it's like
what the hell if you could collab with
anybody who'd be in both music and
makeup I think I want to do Danny's
makeup oh she's one I favorite people in
the world she's really beautiful offer
I'd want to do her makeup but I'd be too
scared to sing with her so I just like
maybe hum along and just like a shame
what's going on today eardrums
I'd be too spooked to say no that's cute
she's like a little fast okay so what
you hear it's song by Timmy oh well my
fears over forever is so cold but from
the new album and I really like you
don't go from anymore we're just
supposed to cover about flashback I also
been a really lovely crybaby recently I
don't know you need to hear right now so
you you want me to sing it for you you
can see it scared of that thunder
you know crybaby but should make me cry
lady no cry-baby
but just make me cry cry baby oh good I
got a new palates yeah day was 10%
legendary sister that's the plot I used
on you when I did your glam oh yeah yeah
now I remember what if you did a purple
and pink look and try to recreate that I
did on you I do yeah yeah I think you
can kill that walk us through your steps
miss beauty guru okay so I'm just gonna
take you know looking color in my crease
mm-hmm what brush you're using I don't
know this is a random brush I'll crusted
dusted yes it's a crusty dusty brush
that I use every day I love that I
literally only use three brushes I can
give you some I have like a million no
it's okay it's gonna come on great I
love that attitude okay sister I have a
question for you yes would you ever do
another reality competition show never
never never
basically unless I was doing like my own
reality TV show which would be beautiful
I do the bass yeah let me fun how would
you say that the four differs from a lot
of the other like major shows right now
on TV then I would definitely say that
the four is more focused on the artist
yeah I'm like already finding something
that is complete kind of okay well I was
gonna say because I've had a lot of
friends audition for different reality
shows what a lot of people don't know is
that a lot of those reality shows are
not based on talent
literally the slightest ban a lot of
those shows are solely based on your
backstory
yeah the substr which really really
sucks I've had friends that are like
sweating out talent on a daily basis
like they burp talent when they finish
their soda and they were told no because
their story was not intense enough we
were talking about on the four I seemed
like it was actually a really legit
company yeah it's like based on actual
talent I mean it's like you you go on
the stage and you know that the audience
in there doesn't really know you so it's
more like you gotta prove yourself as an
artist rather than like you as a person
well I got to sing you my favorite song
for my finger RS what would you say your
favorite song is right now I love Drake
so it'd probably be one of his okay um
it's between like Phil no ways and too
good
oh saying to god I love that okay I'll
do I don't know how to talk to you I
don't know how to ask if you're okay
I've friends always feel the need to
examine things seems like they just
happier than us this day yeah I don't
know I don't know how to be there when
you need me if is like the only time you
will see me is when you turn your head
to the side and look at me differently
last night I think I lost my patience
last night I got I the expectation last
night I came to realization and I hope
you get shaky I hope you can take it all
I'm to continue
I'm Way too good to you you would take
my love for granny I just don't
understand it though I do good for you
I'm Way too good to you you take my love
for granny I just don't understand it I
just thought I did the whole ah I just
don't understand it no why did you take
my love for granny
never yours to claim it he was dark and
I was over until you kissed my lips and
you saved me my hands they're strong but
my knees were far too easy
then you're marooned with that fall to
your feet but there's a side to you that
I never knew never knew all the things
you'd say they were never true never
true and the games you play you would
always win always win
your face screaming out your name your
name to the rain when I fell something
died cause I knew there was the last
time
so rude at least another you literally
just slay the entire nation America
waiting to see what is next from Shania

then hopefully this year I'm gonna be
going on tour as well who knows I might
invite you to come on stage so sorry new

things for me about music when I got on

nervous at all

nervous but my leg shakes she just can't
