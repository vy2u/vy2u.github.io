ah what the heck we just need five
million on Instagram
is pretty much impossible to master the
heart of makeup and to become a
celebrity doing so within a year but
that is exactly what James Charles has
achieved he's done before at the age of
18
official source software and hopefully
with us accompany us on this year
yeah oh my god the girl like real at
large the lollipop you're kidding this
is so cool fan art thing I've everything

I enjoyed not a single hole with that my
stomach feels like it is in my throat
right now stammering if you go this is
the biggest drop drop let's do it you
don't worry and this current moment love
them so far but right now the chaperone
turned around it was like James so scary
and she scared you guys
this is my chance so we just said that
ride three times now um it was really
late not gonna live and I am soaking wet
from talking about him my brand-new
clothes that I just bought yesterday
that were several hundred dollars that's
great
we kept rewriting over over him because
there's the camera at the top just like
every rider takes your photo and by the
second time around we figured out where
the camera was so we wanted to create an
Instagram meme out of it because y'all
know it that's what I'm known for
starting a meme anyway
I screw clothes none of us are looking
so we have no idea where the camera
actually was oh wow yeah
you're kidding not gonna play the
helicopter tour
oh my god my face scared me either
wow-whee Lord which leg forward Oh see
much better
good hurry wow this is a good good
we are in Surfers Paradise here on the
Gold Coast and I thought I would stand
here today and let a bunch of strangers
do my makeup
I'm scared hopefully Border Patrol
doesn't get me good I love being robbed
I'm keeping us much time with you as I
possibly can I'm trying to finish me off
