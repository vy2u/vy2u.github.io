James Charles dig'em take you around our
Punta Cana lounge so first we got this

packing in our Punta Cana keep it where
10,000 miles from home all right nice

just woke up it is curling 9 o'clock
here meaning it is 8 o'clock in our
timezone right yeah so we are getting
upper and go get some breakfast we are
going to go to the buffet because we are
hungry as
julia is vegan queen of bean vegan so we
need to like buy good options for her
because she hate meat or dairy or eggs
so this is a little bit of a challenge
to say the least but Rohit see you just
walked all the way to the breakfast area
of the resort and of course it was
closing so we can't get any vegan food
for Julia turned down we're gonna go to
the cafe now and see what our options
are because we're all literally starving
we have not eaten since like last night
and we had to get vegan sushi for Julia
but it honestly was really really good
but there was not a lot of it so no
we're just really searching for more
food come on Nellie she's gonna give me

Republic day 3 I'm currently just
chilling on at the nice little daybed by
the pool about to edit some vlog footage
and just check up on all my social media
stuff in YouTube videos Rachael's
currently editing a video in the resort
room because she filmed of course the
night before she left literally the most
hard-working woman I now cannot relate
thank God but we are going to I think do
some makeup today into another photo
shoot we may or may not have to snuck
into the club
Oh
good morning everybody we are currently
at breakfast meal Anka just turn it out
to the airport and we are hungry in his
house and we ran to the diner for
clothes that we're going to eat a little
spoon Wow I cannot wait okay so we are
on the way back to the room
rachel is writing this interesting one
day to say the least but we laughed
urgently because me and devorah both got
the sudden urge of having teased the
bathroom
Oh sister let's not lie let's not line
at the camera okay so I just turn on my
contacts and a little bit of highlighter
Oh okay apparently a lot of it yeah but
julia is holding a video today and she
wants us to juju on that beat for her
fails video of 2016 and trust me when I
say there's not a single beat that I
want to be juju on today I want to do
this business
she's gonna be
drop hit the hole no file Hey no stops
why I don't dance I mean we definitely
do dude on a beat
maybe not that beat but a beat was
definitely do dude on today sorry you
had to see that
hi francesca and Azul they came and
found us at our resort little stalker I
came to say hi they're both so cute
thank you guys
now it's gonna be saying about going
home today okay are you excited for
vacation yes only Christmas yeah police
might come back to you thank you for
coming here love you thank you for being
the best yeah wonderful fly oh thank you
so I'm just looking here on the pool bed
at tanning I thought I wouldn't put the
phone down and just talk to you guys for
a quick little second please let me know
when the comes also what you thought of
this entire vlog this is our last day
and it's also my first time vlogging so
I'm kind of like starting to get the
hang of it practicing you know the
angles and everything definitely not the
best but you know what we're gonna keep
doing these we're gonna get better
because I love documenting this trip it
was so much fun like I said it is so
nice here it's like 99 degrees right now
but the breeze is coming in from the
ocean and it feels so nice like I just
been sitting here relaxing tanning of
course I got burnt let me show you my
back never cute this is what happens
when you're as pasty and pale as I am
but now I'm just desperately applying
every little hint of sunscreen I can to
hopefully soothe the burning sensation
because let me tell you it certainly
does not feel great by any means Rachel
and Julia are currently filming a video
Srilanka headed out this morning and
devorah and leia
i don't know where they are so hopefully
they're doing something fun also it
sounds so crazy so many of you guys have
found me here at this resort we posted
link the location and so many of you
guys like snuck onto the beach and came
to find us which is so cute we love
taking pictures everybody I saw a bunch
of them on Twitter and stuff everybody
was tagging me it was really so sweet to
be able to find you guys even in such
like a foreign country which I never
even liked it didn't the thought didn't
even cross my mind that I'd be seeing
you guys here but it's so crazy if we
even think about the like I have people
supporting me from all over the world so
that's freaking cool and not only has it
been amazing meeting you guys what's
also been a major perk is that every
girl who's out in to take a picture
always has a very very hot and muscular
older brother who also wants a picture
because some girlfriend that they have
likes me so I've gotten to take many a
picture with many a hot male on this
Beach so what I say I enjoy it
absolutely
good morning guys it is day 4 meeting is
our last day here in Punta Cana

everybody who celebrates I hope you had
a really really happy holidays Julia

nice slumber because she needs me to
film a video for her I think I'm going
to end up the vlog here because it has
been going on for quite a long a
periodical time I really really hope you
guys enjoyed this is my first time ever
doing this so I definitely need to
practice and get better but let me know
what you think I'd love to do more of
these in the future we definitely plan
on going on a lot more trips we're going
