back to my channel so I was on some time
a few days ago you know just doing the
huge taking all the selfies in the world
updating my story making sure all my
streaks were in line but when I went to
go take my good morning some chat BAM
selfie as usual as I do every single day
I came across this amazing filter and
while I was shook as soon as I saw this
filter you guys know my first thought
was holy crap I need to turn this into a
makeup look so maybe read that is
exactly what I did so if you want to see
how I created this full face galaxy
inspired snapchat filter makeup tutorial
how that's a mouthful make sure to keep
on watching I already went ahead to do
my face makeup off camera I figured
since this is obviously a pretty
intricate and detailed look we just
focus on the eyes today for this look
today I'm going to be using my morphe
35o palette you guys know this is my
favorite palette for my color books and
you can use Kota James for 10% off so
we're taking this bright pink shade on
my morphe r39 brush and buffing that all
into the crease I'm really taking a lot
of this pink shade and buffing it all
over the crease and the eyelid just in
general this look and filter kind of
takes up almost the entire eye region so
I'm going to put a lot of this pink in
here because it's going to be a lot of
colors going on and we really want
everything to blend out nicely once I
have all the pink in place I'm just
going to buy morphe I'm a four-for-one
rush I'm going around the edges to make
sure everything is really blown out and
blended I'm pretty happy with how this
looks I think we're going to move right
along I'm going to grab my morphe M
4-3-3 brush and this bright purple shade
from the palette and start to build up
my crease a little bit I'm really
roughly placing this colored in the
outer corner of my crease cuz that's
where I want the most color and then
with that excess under striking into the
inner corner a little bit and as well as
winging it out and then back down into
the lower lash line in the filter the
eyes are pretty dark so I'm going to
stick to that and I'm going to layer
more purple on there and the snap filter
itself in the WCA of the pink tones on
the No
and around the edges of the big smoky
eyes of the constellations but as for
the actual eyelid and like the crease
region is cut it is like a big purple
and black pit of nothing so I'm kind of
interpreting this in my own way with
what I think it would have looked like
if it was a little bit brighter so I'm
going to be using these Purple's Pink's
blacks and blues to kind of stick true
to that um
galaxy a theme once again to that M 4 3
3 I'm taking a little bit about purple
shade and buffing it into the outer
corner of the eye making kind of a
v-shape and then nothing a little bit of
it onto the lid once I get to the other
program I'm just kind of taking that
excess shadow and winging out and really
diffusing the edges like I said I should
have look it's going to be huge for the
lid I'm just taking this blue shade from
the palette and my Sigma e25 blending
brush and just helping it right on I'm
being very very careful in my hand and
I'll packing this blue shade on to the
lid this pallet is extremely extremely
pigmented and I want this blue to pink
transition to be really really pretty
and seamless and really buffed and
blended out so I don't want there to be
any harsh lines once that blue is all on
there I'm going to go back with my
morphe m4 33 which is the brush I use
for the purple and kind of brush over at
the border of the blue and the crease to
make sure everything is really blended
out okay so obviously we have a lot of
color going on right now but I really
like hell in the snap filter there was a
lot of dimension and it was still kind
of dark so I'm going to take my morphe
m56 to brush and mix together the dark
purple blue and black shapes from the
palette and start to bond the end to the
outer corner I'm being really gentle and
careful while doing this blending
because as I'm sure you guys know black
can very very quickly mess up any makeup
look and make it super muddy and really
really really messy how many quickly go
ahead and line my upright and lower
waterlines using it NYX jumbo eye pencil
in black bean I am going to be wearing
lashes with this obviously and I want to
do a little bit more black on the lower
lash line so I'll help everything blend
it together I hate doing this so much oh
my god to my lower lash line i'm taking
my morphe m 213 brush and once again
just mixing those three dark colors and
buffing them into the waterline
now I'm just going to go in
another M 2:13 I didn't realize they had
so many of these I'm dipping into that
purple shade I'm just going to buff out
that black to finish off the shadow
portion of this ayah I'm taking my m4
for one one last time with a little bit
of pink on it and I'm just going to bomb
all around this entire eye look just
make sure we don't lose any of that pink
I would take this I have few steps
further down some pigment or top of the
shadows just make everything pop a
little more and add some excitement so
I'm going to start out by taking makeup
addiction cosmetics pigment into the
Valentine and pop that in the inner
corner and then for the very very inner
corner I'm taking my morphe M 550 brush
spiriting with a little bit of makeup
rubber piston picks and popping on a
rosy future from star crush minerals to
add a final pop I'm going to the tiny
bit of janessa Meyer X pigment in
daydreaming and I'm just going to pop
that right and at the center of the lid
over top of that blue alright that
completes this I have any one into the
other one off camera mirroring it
completely and then when I come back we
will do the consolations mascara and
lashes and then obviously finish off the
rest of the face I will be right back
and there we go the other eye is
complete I'm going to quickly go in and
highlight my nose bridge using my m5 15
and pink heart from anastacio moonchild
I know this is all in like a weird order
but I just want to do the nose highlight
before I put any consolations on cause
we can all make sense in a second just
bear with me tied in the constellations
and the stars so I'm going to use my Wet
n Wild mega liner in the shade trim with
lace which is just the white liner I'm
be incredibly careful to doing this as
I'm sure you can see my hands are
shaking I'm trying to say as still as
possible though and if possible if
you're doing this trying to rest your
hand on either your face or a table or
something so you can keep steady so you
don't make any mistakes I'm not really
into ecology so I have absolutely no
idea what any consolation so it's like
aside from the Gemini one for obvious
reason so I'm kind of just drawing these
in completely randomly
now we have all the big constellations
out there or I want them to be I'm going
back into the same liquid lighter and
adding in stars just to fill up the
empty spaces also just a dir a little
side note if you have a pimple oh my god
turn it into a star Wow
problem solved to Procrit lashes I'm
just going into the benefit roller lash
for lunches today I'm going to pop on is
skeeto lashes in the style life magic
they're pretty wispy and not really
dense which is perfect because obviously
we just did a whole lot of work on the
eyes and we don't want to cover it all
up I don't think there is number one
spent a time that I have put on my
lashes on the first try and gotten them
perfect there's always something wrong
saying they need to be reglued on or so
that needs to be adjusted
what about you guys leave me a comment
below and tell me what your least
favorite part about your makeup routine
is because you all know a mine is
actually a Kobe nose contouring - they
both suck to give my face a nice Spacey
and Spira glow I'm going to go in with
my Anasazi of moonchild okay in the
shade of pink heart with my morphe and
501 brush oh okay Wow for lips today I'm
going to first go in with Anasazi liquid
lip in the shade of potion okay I went a
little bit crazy with the over lighting
today I'm well-aware I can see if my
eyes that I have on my face so please
don't leave any comments about it it is
perfectly 3:41 in the morning and I want
to go to sleep so I'm Way too lazy to
fix it if you don't want to lips tree
this big don't draw this big and that's
not on that to make the lips all Spacey
and metallic I'm first going to layer
over the daydreaming pigment from
donessa my ricks and then just pop me on
a tiny bit of pink art from the moon
child located right in the center and
there we go guys that completes this
full face galaxies nebulae inspired
snapchat realness
