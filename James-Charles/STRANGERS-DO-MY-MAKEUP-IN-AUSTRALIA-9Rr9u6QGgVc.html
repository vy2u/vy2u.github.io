so much fun to do something that we
actually did over in my homeland which
is Los Angeles such as strangers day
makeup on Hollywood Boulevard but
clearly we are not in Hollywood or on a
boulevard we are in Surfers Paradise
here on the Gold Coast and I thought I
would stand here today and let a bunch
of strangers do my makeup so last video
I know there were a ton of sisters
hopefully there'll be a lot of sisters
here today hopefully I'll also go to get
cleaned up by some really hot surfer
dudes as well with some washboard abs in
six packs that we can find in the water
as you can see the ocean is very clear
today so the chances of that
like my relationship life are looking
very very slim we try to do this
yesterday and for some reason the world
is just really really a gun stuff this
could either go really really good or
really really bad doo doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo it's a counting limit I hear
on the Gold Coast and none of the
sisters are showing off hello since the
seagull would you like to do my glom and

hot so I guess we can these are what we
call fake eyelashes you're gonna glue
these onto my face today and then we
also have some glue sister neck when you
hold this if you glue this wrong you
could make me call blind so no pressure
so Nick what do you do I played cricket

job here yes so if I can put eyelashes
on I can do any type of makeup then I
love straight people Alan you still had
a hard time getting my last clue open

favorite and least favorite thing about
Australia I love the web app because
it's like pretty much always sunny yeah

move on to the glow nice to meet you

attacked that's right goddesses are
talking pop I want to be brighter than
the Sun that's shining through the
broken ozone layer here what is like the
legal working age in Australia 14 nine
months what 14 and 9 months guys the
weirdest number I've ever heard in my
entire life 14 why 9 months I never
highly be there before there's gonna be
a shining sister done so we're pretty
