my youtube channel as you can see today
we are not in my normal makeup studio we
are here and the center of Los Angeles
on Hollywood Boulevard and for today's
video I thought we'd do something
probably crazy I may be regretting this
on the end of it but I'm gonna have
strangers walking down the street do you
my makeup hopefully I'll see some
scissors along the way because I have a
very exciting surprise for them as well
but without further ado let's get
started and wish me luck what's your
like your makeup expertise level would
you say I'm too lazy to wear makeup I
feel on a spiritual level sometimes wear
foundation if I'm breaking out once
again feel that on a spiritual level
so as you're gonna play this one day
since we I want you to steal my career
be a beauty guru and tell the sisters
what you're doing alright so right now
I'm gonna grab the two face and the
color nude one little squirt
she's have like it covered today ladies

as well we gotta cover everything I
likes mr. Tyler okay are we happy I'm
happy with my size just look at this Wow
natural oh I think this is the fact that
you guys need to have maybe not on
camera I don't want to get too monetized
okay guys I think the next up is going
to be my youtube video just can see
whatever you think a sister could use a
little help okay

lock you're not doing your best work

concealed but we need to set definitely
so hopefully we can find someone else
and it looks like hello sister your
eyebrows look amazing my goal is to have
your brows I loved on that's a present
artistry right there well if you leave
