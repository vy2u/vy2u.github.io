just go right in okay well after
covering my brows with a glue stag well
I am gonna do my makeup like I think

formula yeah now did we bring my color

concealer okay this is really good luck
for me I think for me you have the YSL
all ours foundation yeah I've never
tried this one before so it's cool
excited she's a little light who the
dark ones light yeah let's go right over
the brows ready for this okay let's see
it well know if the foundations full
coverage it looks like it is literally
shaved it with the mach3 raised there
yeah if you like we have a lot of things
that we want to talk about today so I'm
down I'm gonna open book what I'm sure
you guys all probably know if you were
like well-versed in the makeup
community's lost industry is that when I
started the beauty industry me and Jeff
we've had serious beef kinda we did huh
yeah like bad it started off my sister
scandal there's been a few moments we
just talked about them all yeah great
all right so we met in New York at
actually the Jacqueline's lon dog
champagne pop James is at the party I
had flown to New York with some friends
and we were there and I'd never met
James before remember you came up to me
I did I was super excited to meet
Geoffrey yeah
you guys know that I came into this
industry pretty fast even though I was
so growing as an influencer I was still
a major fan of all the people that were
up there yeah which I didn't even know
at the time so looking back on like ouch
like people were a little mean girl
so I remember someone I was with was
like uh I don't really want you to take
a picture of James and did it and it's
like this whole weird thing and I'm like
I mean he's cool he's a boy and
beauty like let's meet him he's younger
like I lived for and I love your
artistry
thank you I saw you use my liquid lips
like his liner and you were just like
full-on taking it there so I was excited
but it sucks when and I could admit it
even at my age that people do have an
influence in like it on you
yeah and when someone's in your ear like
kind of staying you kind of follow along
which sucks so I was a follower in a
situation that I definitely regret it
yeah I mean I apologized for that night
being so short and annoying but you know
looking back I'm like oh my god it's
just so high school
you know it sucks so like the center she
really is very high school the next
thing that happened was a twitter battle
and this is when I was very small
mystery and I was doing a lot of like
the crazy looks all the time that you
were just talking about like every day I
was pulling out some new look yeah that
I wasn't growing as fast as obviously I
am now because the thought that I was
doing these crazy creative looks I will
admit I definitely did have a little bit
of like an ego when I first came in okay
and lovely a groaner to say that though
yeah yeah absolutely and in my eyes I
was getting frustrated the people like
Jeffery or Mandy who did more classic
lamb were growing and skyrocketing of
Fame when I was pulling out these crazy
career books and no one has ever seen
before and I was staying at the bottom
yeah I remember tweeting asking for my
followers to send me ideas for creative
videos or creative makeup look okay yes
somebody replied and said like oh do
swing inspired by Manny and I quoted it
and literally said girl I said creative
you did take it there and I was with
Manny at that time and we were sitting
in a car going somewhere and oh girl I
was it was it was rough ridiculous and
it was so childish but at the time I was
literally sixteen I just how about
sorority convicts and I had an ego and I
will definitely be able to admit that
now of course I've never hurt feelings
no it came off very conscious I can't
read things on the internet yeah
can't read how someone's talking it so
it came off a little harsh and I
remember you definitely hurt his
feelings no girl James yeah so I know
what to think about James at that time
me and Manny were just in the car like
it was bad once it turned into kind of
like a group beef with friends yes I me
know when people are really friends
you're loyal and you want to chime in
like what so I remember me and John we
started arguing on Twitter and then you
had addressed me I knew had talked about
how I introduced myself to you that
night at the dock on the back line I
thought the next big thing of the beauty
industry and I was just like wait a
second whoa I may be a little bit
egotistical but I would never ever ever
ever ever say that so I was so spooked I
instantly had texted Manny trying to
squash the beef and apologize but it was
a little bit too late I couldn't take
back what I said yeah a little too soon
like sometimes people aren't ready to
hear sorry
right away they may like get over being
angry or like their feelings which
obviously we both can definitely a tough
dude annoying for SAP but it was a very
interesting situation to say the least
hmm but it sucked does that like have
your number to like fix it or really
call you I was just more in the vein of
like okay whatever like you may have
that coming up Manny you guys can fix it
but you guys ended up fixing it yeah
obviously I apologized on a personal
level too but even in a business sense
which I definitely want later on in this
video
okay it's stupid to burn bridges with
people in your industry that you're
forced to work with and you're forced to
see all the time so all the time I
always try to say drama free which
Geoffrey I can't relate cannot relate at
all times but I think that is why we're
so different and I think that'll be an
interesting conversation later on as
well I'm gonna contour okay I'm gonna
use the lemare the pillow dude the
powder it's literally called the powder
it's so boozy that's all you get
how much you can cost that's like with
tax $97 yeah I'm just gonna set my
entire face with this and my Beauty
Blender okay I'm gonna start contouring
with the Anastacio classic contour kit
all right and I'm gonna go in it with my
morphe M 5 to 7 brush you can use code
James at checkout for 10% off watch your
sister yes we got more drama to discuss
the star I'm look I'm carving out my
cheekbones hit me what what's another
good moment oh that we would love to
the makeup repre party Oh sister James
wants to go for the beheading I think we
do hit me what really got us going good
here woohoo I'm sweating and my actual
indirect beef with Geoffrey and it was
with Nikita yes and one day I was gonna
make up forevers party I had gotten
ready and I did a crazy blue glitter
look right I wasn't there no you were
not there no this is right when Kylie
was first launching her makeup line yes
and I wore a black lipstick and it was a
hundred percent Jeffrey's there's mother
I hated him there was no denying that he
has a good formula yeah and I tagged it
when I posted in certain picture as
Kylie no shade literally just wanted the
Kylie repos I was really close phones
the makita still AM and she came up to
me and was like talking up my lips and
stuff and talking about my look and
she's like oh is that like a Geoffrey
weirdo moment crash like she kind of
figures you know I had the best black on
the machine you know is this the Kylie
lip but I was like no it's Jeffries and
oh you told her that yeah think nothing
of it Nikita hops right on snapchat and
puts her phone in my face it's driving
me to hell and back but I'm thinking
it's a Jo
once the stop had kind of completed I
realized oh my god wait this isn't a
joke at all and she was like looking
over I said please don't post that like
please do not post that actually here in
the snapchat me saying please do not
post that but she did it went up anyway
and I of course was at the party so I
don't know that it went up and told two
hours later after I had already left and
was getting thousands and thousands and
thousands of hate tweets from Nikita's
fans from your fans from that whole
squad calling me out for being shady and
for lying and okay for being just like a
shitty person I was so shocked and so
upset you're like does he not still be
happening yeah so I called Nikita like
super scared alarm like what the heck is
going on like help me she was in the
club so she did not get my call finally
after like two hours of texting her she
finally answered and like we ended up
solving and apologizing and resolving it
but hey because that was like wow so
using my lipsticks but didn't tag it
like which I been that before too cuz
same that's a little I talked about this
a few times before but that's literally
one of the main reasons like rusev asked
was because I literally cannot afford a
lot of brands makeup so I lied about it
and then the brand to repost me I love
that we live American ballin on a budget
oh yeah absolutely huh you know I can
appreciate that hi
BAM okay
ready to highlight we're gonna use the
classic James the full sister highlight
moment and now we're gonna use both of
these yeah
Anasazi it's a Hollywood and the tar
chrome paint in a top band alright let's
take the classic all jokes aside and
more p.m. five-10 brush every little
sister spritz mm-hmm I also just need to
do it to my whole face anyway like you
do it BAM
I feel like I'm doing a drag tutorial
right now who you are okay so I'm gonna
go ahead and start my eyebrows now and
these need to be right pink which I am a
full scared okay so I'm gonna use the
vivid bright scream color those are
unreal and then probably mix it with a
little bit of druglord as well we're
gonna fully start this transformation no
James did give me the iconic morphe
palette 235 be okay we got the 35 be
I've never really used this one the best
one if you haven't heard of this I'm
sure you have because it's James here it
is
oh wow full rainbow okay you definitely
have a thinner eyebrow than I do a
little bit more of an arched brow yeah
due to low do it like a uh-huh here yeah
and then alright now I'm gonna start
painting some blue oh look at eyebrow
okay the structure is getting there now
have you ever done a pink brow for fun
no I've done dry brows yes but not pink
amazing oh we have one more drama thing
to talk about
okay wait ten more we actually ended up
squashing our beef oh my god at the door
already yeah oh my god okay I was there
and didn't even know you were gonna be
there no and in walks James and I was
like okay and I was like and the beef
and like any drama had happened like
months ago and I was just in a different
place mentally and I was like okay you
know what like let's talk about it talk
about it yeah me and James went outside
on the patio for an hour while everyone
is drunk and smoking cigarettes come out
really and came not really ooh and we
just talked about everything and it was
really nice we just talked to each other
like normal people yeah you know what no
one else chiming in there's energy can
be really overwhelming which a lot of
people I'm sure you guys can understand
after like just watching us but the one
thing that like is really common with a
lot of people in this industry is the
fakeness yeah and there's a lot of
people who are very very two-faced and
are fake and despite the fact that I
didn't hate Jeffrey for a long time
because of really stupid stuff I did
always respect him and always made a
note of this one talking about him as
well
that I not only respected his ability to
be blunt and honest but also has a
business mindset what to talk about
later but I think the fact that we were
able to just sit down and just be
face-to-face and just own everything
that we have both that wasn't very
important it was important and it's
something that not a lot of people are
able to do it was really really cool I'm
really thankful we're able to do it
because now of course we're fine I think
the problem is you have people chime in
your ear or you hear something online or
someone tells you what James maybe no
it's nice to just go to the source like
I have James's number we're really cool
so if there's any ever a problem is a
girl someone said he maybe has said this
and he's like oh just trying to make up
some it never said that great hope it'll
be a good day like it's so easy to have
a normal conversation and people don't
communicate I think in this industry a
lot yeah and it's not healthy that's not
okay enough with the drama we've had it
quite the journey but yeah we would have
no issues for months and probably never
again kaguro adults
okay sister James is testing me right
here with this moment and I love it
I'm trying to conceal my pink eyebrows
I'm scared oh wow Ivan even really
looked up yes now when someone says that
brows can only be sisters and not twins
can't relate cuz that's look pretty
identical honey they're still sisters
though have you ever done like crazy
look like this before you know oh yeah
this is the first I love that you're
taking me out of my comfort zone we're
really just going there and okay
something that's been on my mind is yeah
I have seen a lot of people come and go
in this industry right I'm gonna call
myself an OG yeah and it's really cool
to just watch you from far away and see
your business sense because there's a
lot of people that thank you you know
and I really appreciate and admire how
you are about your business at such a
young age definitely something that a
lot of people should look up to and
admire because you don't play around
thank you yeah oh my god hearing that
from you honestly means the world
I always said and you can ask anybody
best I hate Geoffrey but I think that
the way you handle yourself although may
not be the most professional sometimes
there's a reason you've been around for
ten years and are not falling off
anytime soon and I think that that's
something to really pay attention to oh
that pushes weight to it dance haha to
really pay attention to and something
that has made me look up to you it's
kind of a role model in the sense
I've just seen so many kids that are my
age get into this and grow quickly and
they completely throw it away and just
make stupid decisions and I've always
been thrown who's very calculated I love
numbers I love statistics I love all
these things addicting
it really is honestly and I would so
much rather be focusing on that and
being brainstorming with my team and
seeing what can we really do next to end
everything up rather than like going to
a party or like getting coffee yes I
just love that because you really remind
me of me at a younger age I think what I
really admire about how you're handling
things is like you're not overspending
like money's rolling and but you're
being really responsible and I don't
know who taught you that whether it's
your parents and you can tell me in a
second yeah but it's cool that you're
not just being wild because I've seen so
many people come and go in this industry
they start making money and they
literally spend at all I think it's
gonna it's just like yeah every month
it's like forever and it's like you know
it's good to treat yourself like I love
you treat yourself once in a while yeah
but you're not being crazy and like
irresponsible right which at your age I
can't believe you're not yeah I think
that amazing once again I've seen so
many people do it and I think that's
part of the reason why I'm not also like
with my family I didn't grow up poor per
se but we definitely didn't have any
extra money at all yeah and my mom and
dad honestly did a really great job of
lying to be my brother about it and
trying to just provide for us in any way
that they possibly could to make us
happy which still to this day means so
much time so basically you're saying
like they didn't really tell you the
financials district right guys that
right
from being a child that you know has
experiences moment it's cool because I
didn't get that so I'm gonna share some
not it's not dark it's just you know
yeah it's a sick childhood stuff so my
mom definitely did not know any of that
stuff she had bad credit she was in debt
when I was young and there was constant
like money problems that were always
stressing us out yeah it's cool that
your parents didn't let you guys feel
that stress yeah I remember definitely
feeling a lot of that stress
I'm very just thankful for the way that
I was raised with that in the sense that
I did always save my money and I've
always been a very very like versed in
the technology and like social media
area even as famous before like had a
business where I would make stuffed
animals with a girl in my school
your Instagram accounts in the Twitter
house I got bored and didn't do it
anymore I would just sell it or just
move on I'm a dead person where I like
to go big or go home and every powders
that I'm working on and if I'm not
feeling inspired anymore I'm like wow
yeah and I'm not gonna waste I'd housing
that I don't care about and when I first
started doing makeup my mom was like oh
we were gonna get bored of this in 20
minutes yeah we're not buying you these
lights we're not buying you this makeup
you're gonna get bored in 20 minutes
the best but surprisingly I'm still here
after almost three years of doing at
Afghans because now that thankfully I
have been able to grow in the beauty
space I'm constantly challenged with new
things and I'm able to kind of keep
growing creatively will just awesome I
like how you were honest last year and
you were like look guys like I don't
want to be someone that just does little
bronzy tutorials and reviews like this
doesn't get me off yeah and I love how
you were just honest about that I don't
want to be just a review channel and no
tea no shade because like review
channels are awesome and I go to review
channels when new products being exactly
yeah today we're still consumers as well
yeah and I look to my peers especially
Tati when I used to see if something is
really really good and a lot of other
channels as well so nothing against them
but for me person tin spire me to sit
down and do that type of stuff I love a
review yeah where I get to just be
really real time it's just bringing for
me to like I said and use the same
products every video oh my god no yeah I
didn't know mostly followers know that I
use the same stuff in every single video
a very very rarely I think my most
recent edition was the k'kaw
highlighting powder but nothing has been
added in - oh so for me to sit down a
big oh yeah guys this concealer is
really really good everyone's like no
it's not completely laia
so for me I only do reviews if I like
know that it's gonna be like a good
video and like bacon yeah it's like we
want to hear you review right Kim K -
today but for the most part I just try
to keep myself inspired creatively
because I know the second thought I'm
not inspired I'm out and I really love
me done the new female of this community
and I love my followers that I have
built so it's kind of like an incentive
for me to like not get bored yeah so I'm
trying to close myself to stay on top of
things and really push the boundaries so
thank you for saying that yes yes of
course
alright we are blending oh yeah eyes
coming together oh my god this way it's
so pigmented
come on blue clothes is why right it's
like you're your butter mm-hmm Wow
sister snapped okay I have a question
for you what is next for James like do
you want to do a collab with the brand

you want to put out a makeup line what
do you want to do for right now I'm just
focusing on just getting content and
really like having everybody shaking

their comfort zone so like if I can have
my friends do something cool and to have
a little fun while doing it
I don't know a lot of my looks like this
I always like to add a lot of dimension
and a lot of different like colors and
pigments and shadows to just so they
like photograph really nicely and also
if you like more than just a makeup look
I really like these to feel like a piece
of art they sure look like one when I
saw those here for the first time I was
like she did that oh thank you sir I had
one thought for you that you need to
leave downtown crawl I'm well aware I
arrived
I am trying I'm trying to buy house
which I talked about a few videos ago
but oh you did yeah let's give my mother
sister update you guys know I'm 18 but
because I'm 18 I just got a credit card
last year for the first time yeah and my
account is set up so all my credit card
bills get wiped in sleep in my account
her my credit score should technically
be perfect but because this is my first
year credit it's not perfect right when
you get a house they average together
your last two years of income and of
course this year with income I made a
lot of money and I've been saving all my
money very wisely I'm really making sure
that I keep everything because I have
known that I wanted to my house but last
year I made nothing okay not nothing but
I made very little compared compared to
this year of course and when those two
numbers are outfits together they're not
good so clearly I'm stuck in that
situation when my best friend's Mother's
was actually really to co-sign on my
mortgage with me for a house which is
why insane yeah that's a big thing they
do yeah but and apparently to have a
cosigner you need three lines of credit
I don't even have one good line of
credit how would I ever have three lines
of credit on a house which is also so
stupid because the parent of a cosigner
is to adjust your credit
yeah but like so now they're like being
in a little impulse so now they're being
impossible so it looks like I'm sister
stock but at this but I'm trying to
figure out anything that I can in five
years so now I hope to be moving on to
the next big thing and you'll be chillin
in my mansion and yeah
you know like not have to worry about
the type of stuff but I just really want
to get the house and I want to be able
to have one for my parents and I'm so
yeah my brother move in with me and get
a car and a dog and lately that place of
my editors my team and it is most
fulfilling to help others yeah I got my
mom a house buy my mom a brand new car
just so amazed I helped all my you know
all my friends people like I've had
cousins and family members I just can't
get ahead because they're in debt I wipe
it clean you know if you know I hear
about that and people really don't ask
me the good thing I mean there's been
some family members that literally think
they but you're like they're personal
yeah I am Bank of America so when people
act entitled yaga blog I don't care if
you're my mom's sisters cousins whatever
like girl I and if we haven't talked to
me in 10 years maybe not maybe just say
how are you cousin not oh my god I need
to borrow money and my girl that's crazy
so family can't also hurt you and
sometimes but they can also be really
great you have really supportive parents
which is awesome you have a you know
like one brother or how many siblings
one brother okay sister Ian yeah and
yeah keep you know obviously you keep
those people close but people will start
coming out of the woodwork and they
already are not family thank God my
family's amazing and a good nothing
portable yep France eeeh and actually
had an experience where a few of his
friends started asking him for money
when we filled our videos - James hasn't
even sent me our Chuck yeah like what is
16 16 oh my god Furion what is another
16 year old neat what's wrong what do
they need easy's and mac makeup or what
do they need it was stop it actually I'm
saying no that was a disappointing
Sirians for him this is reigns between
me and Ian has really brought us closer
together because yeah we didn't really
help the best childhood growing up and
so many people thought that I was just
using improv use on our videos together
which I mean I get it the videos do
really well so like I could see where
you might think that but at the same
time like Ian's my brother and because
we didn't really have the brush
childhood together sorry I'm taking
every possible champion
spend time with him be greater than bond
yeah and it's in a really amazing
strains for us together and I'm so
thankful and because of that we have
gotten so much closer we've been talking
a lot more and when that happened he
actually faced timing and was so upset
and was talking about it and I really
had a sit him down and be like listen
you're gonna lose a lot of friends right
yes and it sucks because you think that
more people would come and try to leech
off you and of course they will they
will also get a lot of people that don't
really care for you and you realize that
they were only there for what you had to
offer them yeah yeah which is hurtful
and you gotta let him go it's well at
least he has you tell him that yeah well
I learned that the hard way and I had so
many people that I was close friends
with for years on end but I had to cut
off for my own well-being and fame in
the long run I'm now thankful that I did
but it sucked and I remember crying I
felt asleep so many times over it and
wishing and praying that it would be
different and that I could keep those
people in my life but at the end of the
day I now don't miss any of them and it
sucks to think like that and I gotta be
that way often it's a crow some people
just start to turn a different way or
they have a different mindset as you or
things just change and it's healthy yeah
you know alright so the only part I'm a
little what's right word sister spooked
sister spooked about is the white
steepling I want that galaxy effect yeah
so while I'm sitting there a fluffy
brush like that's okay kind of jiggle it
around a little bit got a little bit
messy and I took a white cream shadow
I'm gonna kind of grab it on here we'd
have to add a little bit more dimension
so that's gonna be like what kind of
looks like stars Oh see I was afraid
that was too much okay well no because
if you go in with a law it kind of
balances it out there especially if you
add in black too dissimilar of fact huh
oh I got it BAM we love a little sister
steepling sticks are weird steepling
stifling a steeples were horses sleep no
it's a ball steeple is church like
alright so we're doing mascara um James
gave me the extended play gigablack lash
from Mac sty free I hope yup I used her
but I do not have a sty great so we're
doing lashes okay we're both doing Miami
I wear Miami unless you
can't even make that up the past coach
aims for money off ok the co with Lily's
house the photos everybody ok these go
James get some money off your morphe
brushes you have Lily lashes your over
liquid lipsticks your life insurance

James I use it talked about it works
Oh what is your favorite and least
favorite part of your makeup routine Oh
least favorite drawing on brows it's
just like taking the time sometimes I
mean I love an alien look this year I've
been very anti brown haven't warm
problem so long that's why I was so
excited to do our collaborative on brows
thank God I just love skin and glow like
I love getting my skin to perfection
from making all the discoloration and
everything go away to full matte Barbie
like I love that and I love I waiting
and it's love yeah I feel like you're
definitely ask in person all right now
we're gonna dive in and use a drug lord
which is vegan and safe around the eyes
and the face and we're just gonna do a
little lightening a little lightening
them my sister strike a full sister
storm strike love I'm gonna gather a
little bit of sarcophagus a little bit
of legendary - I want that mean ketone
in there okay you know now it almost hit
pound sarcophagus cuz Tana took her
whole brush and just went right in there
so thank you for that this thing classic
are we surprised no no we're not
definitely not I have another question
for you Jeffrey hit me baby one more
time yes we were talking earlier kind of
about like the social media how it's
ever-changing and we did mention how you
have been someone who's kind of like the
cockroach of social media oh gee does
not die me and Shane Dawson I've been
doing this since we're too long yes for
too long no kind of rock your brain from
being online for so long what do you
think really separates a creator from
being like just a little fad - like a
long lasting person oh wow and do you
have any advice for me to do that do you
think yeah I think you've already
learned a lot at your age you went
through what most people go through in
like seven years ah yeah in like one
same with me yeah like I addressed
controversy years ago and then I got Bri
brought up ten years later so imagine
like imagining you there like 28 you're
like 10 years later and someone's still
running their mouth
you're that girl it's so far from who
you are but it's the Internet
nothing goes away right so my advice is
really just stay true to who you are
which is exactly what you're doing don't
get mixed up with any more both than
people in our industry I think what's
really kept me let's say relevant and
current I mean it's been a long time
right we're talking from yeah Friendster
to MySpace to Facebook to Instagram to
YouTube it's been a wild journey and
I've always been very authentic and I've
just always been myself I know it sounds
so like boring almost or like bland but
yeah I've just never been a different
person I've always been me and I've
always stuck up for what I believe in
and I've always been passionate about
you know my thoughts and feelings which
I know a lot well you know but you just
gotta stick to doing you and I think
that you're discovering yourself right
now as you get older and you're you're
on the right path and no matter what
anyone says about oh you're a hard
worker and I love watching your journey
and I know people whether it's Coachella
or something else people are always
gonna say something about you but you're
you're doing it the right way and you're
being authentic and don't ever let
anyone take that away from you
thank you what's that's what I gotta say
I mean the world even in the short time
that I've been it's industry like
alongside of you I actually change in
you as well because like let's be real
and I first joined you were very oh yeah
loud and there's a lot going on it was
every day was like I was like oh my god
Jeffrey's I was calling out somebody
else on social media yes and I knew you
on a personal level and but we weren't
dot HOSA friends yeah because there were
so many times I wanted to text you and
be like you are a genius
stop talking yeah and wish you would
have yeah I wish I would have to get a
why yeah let me tell you why I wish you
would have okay and I've never said this
out loud before is because a lot of
people that were around me were making
it worse it takes a real friend to be
able to sit there and call you out on
your bi yes well yes
yeah yeah and I didn't have that really
a lot of learning and that's okay you're
never too young or old to learn I'll say
that yeah well that's very much my
personality as well and like I've i'm
definitely blunt and i've definitely can
hold out for being a little rude or a
little Starkie before to people but in
the long run all when I am that way
towards people especially my close
friends yeah even though it may seem
really harsh and kind of like aggressive
in the moment it takes a real us friend
to be able to say that with confidence
know that this is coming from a place of
love not hate and not being angry to me
I'm the same tear a person like I want
someone to come to me and be like listen
sister I love you the most
you need to shut up you're being awful
right now I'm thankful for those people
in my life and I want people to do that
to me
so I think that's why I have the same
nature to do that to other people cause
like I wish I had somebody to stop me
before we did stupid things but at the
end of the day it does shape us as a
person and it really allows us to grow
and become better but I find that with
thankful for the people that are and
you're going oh yeah and have your back
exactly yeah okay so we have one last
step of course for every makeup or two
of Courtney and these looks are iconic
so I think we have to set them in place
