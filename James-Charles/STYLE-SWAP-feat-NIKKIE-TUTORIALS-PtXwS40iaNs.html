welcome back to my youtube channel today
is a very very special day as you can
see I'm trying to be super super special
guest one of by far I think the most
talented people in the makeup industry a
living legend myself nikkietutorials is
joining us today all the way from
Holland she is by far my favorite people
in literally the entire world so for
today's video I have something very very
fun planned this is actually a challenge
that has never been done before and it
is a new series that I am starting on my
channel so I hope you guys are super
super excited for this this is a new
challenge that I like to call style
swamp
we love the Focolare so what do you have
a galaxy banner on your face or just a
beautiful everyday at a glam look behind
every makeup look as an artist and
that's what all of us influencers or
here to share our art with you guys and
even though we are all here and we're
all teaching you we all have a very very
different styles and techniques that you
guys have picked up from us I picked out
a look from my Instagram past I think
represents me best and my artistic
abilities and also sister Nicci has
picked out a look that she's done in her
past that she really really loves and
represents her and her techniques and
we're going to switch looks and
challenge each other we're doing the
other person's look and switch makeup
bag so we have to use all the other
person's products and try our best to
recreate the same techniques without
further ado okay ready
I feel like if anybody's gonna be able
to do this look it's gonna be you same
okay okay ready one two three okay oh my
god I'm giving you this very it's a very
Nikki glam look umm it's got a cut
crease in there it's got a halo eyes got
a little later liner um a red lip glowy
skin it's got everything you think of
when you think of a Nikki look hmm and I
have a solar eclipse on my face how did
you even do that a lot of face pain
[Laughter]
there you go sister I love trading with
the sister love a sister trade
let's get started have you never glued
on your brows before run it all the way
through so it's like super super intense
going against the yeah yeah all this
primer is like stinging my face a little
bad stinging yeah for foundation Vicky
has the huda beauty foundation which
I've been so excited to try let's
freakin do this I think this might be a
little bit light for me oh fast like
Mary's my hair come back I'm gonna mix
it with a darker so a foundation that
she hasn't here to hopefully make a more
sister James color when was the last
time you did like an intense look like
this
never yes you have but I've never like
drawn the sword clips away well there's
a first for everything I got first for
everything so sister Anna here you've
been doing YouTube for almost 10 years
now how this year will be my 10th god
bless you you and chocolate hell were
the two people that I used to like watch
that like got me into makeup in the
first place it was literally you so
crazy because last night when we and
Nicky were together I hadn't mentioned
her in my Instagram story and she like
clicked on it cuz you get a DM when that
happens and she found a DM for me from
2015 it was so cute so James send me in
2015 he sent me this photo right here oh
god and he said oh I'm posting this
tonight inspired by Lady gaga - I love
your video so much I cannot even explain
you inspire me each and every day and I
seriously do adore you and love you
thank you for being so amazing Nikki and
Nikki never responded welcome to the
beauty world right here I am finding
Make Up For Ever HD Stix
okay my all-time favorite I can do that
Lea tiny bit of foundation you know it's
the light comfort everyday look wearing
a mask hello I've got my challenge cut
out for me today
I think if anybody can recreate this
look though it's like you for sure
I don't because I feel like we're kind
of the only two beauty gurus that like
made it to the top doing like more
creative stuff and that's I'll show you
anybody I just reeling our styles are
definitely kind of different from people
that um like you know I just love makeup
so much that I kind of get carried away
and just keep on going and going and
going like I started doing makeup for
the art behind it and I definitely like
fell into this career accidentally yeah
you're one of the few people that I
still like watch and I'm constantly like
impress Wylie well I think because I've
been doing this for almost ten years now
it's fun to sort of like keep like
daring yourself to do new stuff and took
you trying new looks agree and then
Nikki always uses her trusty Maybelline
fit me powder well thought so Clara can
actually see what I'm doing with my base
today because in my video I wasn't
allowed to have a mirror I'm doing this
we did makeup roulette over on Nikki's
channel where we had a bunch of
different maker challenges all in one it
was definitely and trusting to say the
least I did - you guys have to go check
it out the result is honestly shocking
shocking yeah I don't want to give you
guys the team you have to go check it
out but we were a little bit shocked not
gonna lie oh that's me out of my
forehead
flashback Mary Nikki what did you do to
the back in town I didn't do anything
mr. Sampat except not my problem
speaking of the fact that we both got
into makeup for the are who are some of
your favorite artists right now that are
constant giving you inspiration I'm
really in love with the UK artist right
now same so Mitchell Mitchell and say
things they see the bands page Louise I
don't know what isn't that UK water or
there but magic literally they're so
good like their technique is so
different their style is so different
and really as a breath of fresh air
yeah after years at this same blended
smoky eye they are giving us something
completely different and new I'm so
excited to announce that every single
Sunday I'll be having an artist that I
really really like
respect and think deserves a bigger
platform take over my Instagram story
and give like a full-on tutorial for all
your sisters out there I think it's so
exciting this past Sunday I had my mama
Mitchell like we were just talking about
and it was so much fun
he literally gained like 20,000 forms
it's just so cool so thank you guys for
supporting the people that I support
that's so dope yeah well well I'll
deserve so I'm just excited to be giving
um smaller artists like bigger platform
because obviously I want to help anyway
we love sharing things we do love
sharing sister I feel like a lot of Isis
covers wouldn't know that you're
actually from another lens yeah
which is so crazy because your English
is the way perfect yeah well you don't
even have an oxide either I've like
English is a really hard language to
learn and that we say so much stupid
stuff we do I have a funny story to tell
you actually so when I was younger
probably like 11 or 12 years old I went
camping with my cousins and literally in
the middle of nowhere
and we met these two dust kids named
Peter Paul and Sophie the true is you
can think of literally and I remember
they really teach me a few things to say
in dogs and I don't remember any of that
except for one thing
and I want to tell it to you and I want
to know if it has anything correct off
if I yo so hard slam don't ya hut knees
an out your navel oh my god so basically
what you just said was I'm gonna punch
you so hard you're gonna blah blah blah
blah blah
were you friendly with me I'm gonna slap
you so hard that you'll sneeze out of
your belly button so after like
literally eight years now I still show
Hartland that you had not you never I
think that's why I was pretty close yeah
okay I'm really scared now cuz now I
have to move on to the hard part okay
what did you do first the black circle
I'm gonna be using the morphe 35o a.m.
today to do this eye shadow look for the
base of the glitter liner you can use
code jams or code Nikki for 10% off your
purchase but you should use Co James I
also love that you gave me
this look because yours did 588 thousand
likes because it was the day of the
flippin solar eclipse well I'm here in
January and it's cloudy well do you want
five hundred eighty thousand like yeah
I'm literally a meme on what happens
when you mess up your eyeliner I'm not
skilled enough to do this yes you are
attitude no how did that yellow end up
up there you're kidding karma don't talk
to me it's been a long time since I've
used colored eyeliner it's been a long
time since I've drawn a galaxy on my
eyes thank you
what look are you the most proud of that
you've ever created I think probably my
blank canvas won not only fun to do
creatively but I think it also like had
a really really cool message behind him
that I was like really proud of but I
also really like done that you're
working on the Eclipse one and then also
my Sun and Moon one inspired by the
milkface chart that you didn't want to
do that one although I didn't want to do
it thank you what about you
the pulled up demon one yeah mm-hmm I
hate glitters Tom I hate the galaxy so
it's so different from yours though like
so different well it's okay I think the
whole point of this is that we're a
contagion right
these are own skills and techniques and
mix them with the other person's and
really create new art inspired by other
ODS
yeah obviously crediting people is
important but I think it's really cool
to be able to take somebody's art and
look at it in your own way with your own
skillset and be able to kind of
reimagine it and give it a new life that
the original artists may have not
intended or may have not yeah thought of
you know we can all inspire each other
to create new look absolutely when I did
a blank canvas luck even though I gave
Jody home the original artist credit in
my video and in my Instagram picture and
in my youtube description there was so
so many people that were commenting on
her picture being like oh my god James
stole this from you and there were even
people that commented on my picture
saying oh my god Jodie Holmes stole
stole your luck I was like oh my god
first of all she did this first and then
she actually messaged me apologizing and
I was like girl please do not apologize
and she actually sent me such a kind
message and she's like I was inspired by
her look thank you so much for creating
it like it's a really really cool so we
inspired each other which was so cool
but because of like the energy in the
makeup community she felt the need to
apologize to me because people were
talking her I think that there is
definitely like way too much competition
in the community where it does not need
to be that way at all we're all here
because we shared the same love for
makeup
exactly that's what I've been saying
everyone people copy each other on
people they don't give credit and people
shade each other on Twitter like
doesn't need to be like necessary yeah
if we could all just enjoy makeup a
little bit more and enjoy the process a
little bit more and leave each other
would be great the galaxy will be very
happy so like we were saying earlier
obviously you live in Holland yeah could
you ever see yourself moving to LA oh
not permanently I love home so much and
I love my family my friends too much to
like leave that behind forever
this past year when I graduated early I
had definitely a hard time leave my
family friends behind but if anything I
feel like I would rather like hopefully
one day when I'm rich fingers crossed
I'm being able to move my family and
friends here there's literally no matter
money in the world that could ever get
me to move back home mm New York I like
the vibe that Ali has and I like the
fact that like everybody is here because
they have a goal to like make it in life
and I think that's really really cool
yeah everyone has a dream yeah which is
very inspiring I don't know where I grew
up like I grew up with people that like
when I told them oh yeah I wonder
graduate early and go be like a makeup
artist they're like oh my god haha like
good luck and now I'm like ha ha good
luck at your 9 to 5 job which there's
absolutely nothing wrong with but I'm
people that are scared to make the
change themselves right those are the
people seeing all of that but I think
it's a fair feeling to have because this
whole entire world and realm is so new
to everybody when I talked I was like oh
yeah like I'm not gonna go to college
I'm gonna be a famous youtuber my mom
was like like you're playing fi tea and
literally like she thought until
literally the week of acceptance that I
was going out she thought that I had
applied and written my essay and then
letters were out and she's like James
like where's your acceptance letter like
you had to make it in because I had
really good grades and I was like no mom
and I literally didn't tell her until
after the date that they had all went
out and I was like yeah I never wrote it
and she's like you're literally kidding
but at that point we had hurry like
disgust me moving to LA she kind of knew
but it was just like a nice like yeah
she didn't to really believe it but it
was a nice move for me too
like yeah like I'm really doing this and
it took like a while for them to really
understand that like I have faith in
myself and that like I had a dream and I
was gonna make it work and it really
took me those first two you like big
paycheck so then to be like okay maybe
he does have this in the bag right I
think it's a really cool girl that's
like I'm so thankful for but it is
definitely a new a new reality for a lot
of people so it was so crazy to me to be
able to lightning indulge Annette I
don't know I want you to move all right
sisters we've been climbing for a really
really long time and we definitely are
getting into concentrated mode here we
have a lot to do today so I'm gonna go
ahead and finish the other eye
off-camera and sister Nicci is gonna add
her finishing touches to her solar
eclipse and we'll be right back with the
finished looks alright guys we are back
with our completed style swapped looks
I'm so proud of herself I am - yours
literally looks so good it looks
literally I think even better than my
original no seriously it is so different
but what I love about it is that I
started off and I was so scared I'm
nervous and I didn't know what to do but
also because of you you were like you
got this just you know keep going and
that truly is a part of makeup that I
think a lot of people and even myself
forget that in the end it's gonna pull
through but it just takes a long
yeah I think that's like one thing I've
learned while doing those type of looks
it's like in the beginning it usually
looks a little bit wonky until you
really like until that last step what do
you think about - I love that you pull
that wing out way farther than I would
do and it made it so much more fierce
and a blend of the glitter a honey
I like this I normally never work with
glitter no I personally really really
hate glitter it's like one of those
things where it's like I'm a neat freak
I like being clean so when as soon as
you use glitter once it's in your life
for the next like six months I think
everything on this look aside from this
forehead situation it's like so good I
definitely am so excited by a lot of
these products I definitely will be
picking up the foodie beauty foundation
I read that max like cover up concealer
to do my brows and I definitely want to
try out this eye style again and maybe
maybe
you'll see some glitter on my channel
maybe probably for sure you'll see more
creative stuff on my Instagram like yes
it's so fun you look the boss ah we
inspired each other so yeah oh my god
