super well I don't have spent a hot
minute since I uploaded on YouTube my
computer was out of storage my ring
light broke my camera broke a lot has
gone on but I'm here that's all that
matters and I'm filming for you guys
which I'm so excited to get back into
the YouTube game I just had my last
final a few days ago so think on it is
finally summer and I wanted to teach you
guys today how to do my go to summer
freckle look I did a super soft base
with no eye shadow winged liner and
freckles and of course this purple lip
but I do provide you with other lip
options just in case you don't want to
go crazy so make sure you keep on
watching if you want to learn how to do
this makeup look I'm going to start off
by probably my face today using my
benefit Porefessional primer I just
finished finals at school so my skin has
been absolutely horrible from all the
stress acne I've been getting no offense
but I didn't even do that well on my
finals so it wasn't even worth it for
foundations today I'm going to be using
my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick in
the shade Y 315 this is literally gone
so I'm going to be using a morphe 57
brush to scrape this out of the tube to
apply it to my face normally I would
just draw it on but when you use this as
much as I have you can't really do that
any more
I love this foundation for this arm time
because it is oil-based but it's super
dewy and it sets on the skin really
nicely it looks like natural skin as
opposed to like a layer of cake over
your face so I really really love this
foundation and would definitely run I
would definitely recommend it to all of
you guys out there I'm now going to take
my damp Beauty Blender and just blend
this into the skin super seamlessly I'm
not going to go ahead and highlight and
conceal my face using the Too Faced Born
This Way concealer in the shade light
because our brand new I've never used
them before but everyone's been saying
amazing things about them so I'm very
excited to try them out this is my first
time ever using it on my face so honest
review time here we go
I'm also going to take this out I'm
going to do one really
lined on the tip of my nose I've been
practicing my nose contour lately still
not a pro at it my nose is humongous
so I'm doing my best to try to make it
work if you have any tips please let me
know but as soon as I perfect this I'll
make a tutorial for you guys I promise
so you can have a snatched nose like me
like me in the future because right now
let's be real it's not two snatched I've
done it once and you saw it on my
Instagram will ever let that good again
probably not we'll have to find out once
again just taking my damp Beauty Blender
I'm going to blend this into the skin I
really like how this is blending out
this is really nice huh just at my face
today I'm going to using Cody airspun
powder and my morphe e41 brush I'm just
getting a little bit on the brow so I'm
going to top it off because I want to
set my face with powder but I don't want
to take it on like usual because we
still want a little bit of that duty
coming through and obviously we're going
to be using some highlighting powders
later but this will just help it to be
matte but not flat love a good rhyme if
you want you can use my coupon code
James for 10% off all morphe products I
love their brushes and you really should
too if you haven't tried them to bronze
my face today I'm going to using my
benefit hoola bronzer and my morphe m4
3/5 brush this brush is my holy frickin
grail
I'm going to attempt to contour eye nose
please wish me luck this is so hard
I'm using my hula bronzer oh not gonna
panic we can fix this son really needs
to explain to me how to actually do this
because this never works my nose boy
still looks so bad I don't understand
well this is um something to say the
least
I'm going to let this sit for a few
minutes and pray and maybe sacrificing
to the gods and hope that this comes out
okay update still looks bad it still
looks big still looks rusty so I'm gonna
move on because clearly I don't know how
to do this very well and I don't wanna
waste any more of your time we're all
set with the face for now so I'm going
to zoom you guys in so we can do the
eyebrows I'm going to be using my
Anasazi dip brow in the shade dark brown
as usual and my Anasazi at number 12
brush this eyebrow she's the real deal
she goes to church every Sunday she get
straight A's she doesn't do anything
wrong no drugs no sex before marriage
like this is the good bro this one on
the other hand she is the ugly one she's
ugly stepsister she gets no man she got
kicked out of the house for doing too
much weed doing too much we this joke is
suddenly over I'm going to start off
this part by drawing the outline on the
bottom so I never start right in the
front I always start a little bit
outwards just so we can get that nice
bright insta brows aid grabbing a little
bit more of my brush I'm going to define
the tail of the brow this should be
where your brow is darkest so um you're
going to want the most product in this
region
doing your brows on camera is really
something that is so challenging
you should never aspire to do it is not
fun zero out of ten would not recommend
it's very hard the angle number looks
good
how the time your Braille comes out
should be anyway not just taking the
excess product that's left on the brush
that I'm making a little flippity
doo-dah Zin the front of the brow to
define it but not to make it like a
really really dark because we want like
I said the nice fade the hombre brow
this did not come out as bad as
affecting so yes follow that if you're
going to do your brows now I'm going to
go in and clean up the bottom of the
brow I'm going to use the same concealer
as before the Born This Way one and the
morphe e43 brush to make sure it's super
defined so lurch what I said before you
really want to start in the middle of
the row and blend outwards as opposed to
just starting from one end and going
right to the other it will help you
blend my star and make it look really
really natural and just define as
opposed to a white line underneath your
brow which never ever ever is cute to
finish out this brow I'm just going to
go to the my a tinted brow gel from
Anastacio in the shade espresso to set
all the hairs in place so they don't
move throughout the day and this is a
finished James chose brow I'm going to
go ahead and do the other one off-camera
then we can get started with the eyes
for this lips today I'm actually going
to do no eyeshadow but I am going to
teach you guys how to do a bomb-ass wing
for this I'm gonna be using my Kat Von D
tattoo locket liner in trooper I like to
make my wings more straight out as
opposed to straight up because my eyes
are very hooded and my eyebrows
obviously have zero arch to them so this
really flatters my face shape and helps
to widen everything out
now let me help on when done once again
we pray to the Lord make us few
sacrifices because now need to do the
other one and hope to god that it's even
if you're later isn't even it's okay
trust me most people's probably aren't
it's a thought that count for mascaras
today I'm going to using my benefit
roller lash this up is my Holy Grail
absolutely love it i've raved about it
since the beginning and it's my
ride-or-die i'm just applying a really
light coat because i am to be wearing
falsies with this look so i don't want a
lot of mascara
four launches today I'm going to be
applying s Quito lodgement Politan
lashes they are so cute and they start
off really really tiny and get huge as
they go out so I absolutely love the
shape of lash and it flatters my face
super nicely and it will probably find
are yours too
darÃ­o that's the ice completed I'm
going to go ahead and zoom at mass we
can finish the rest of the face
Tyler we face today I'm going to using a
mix of two Anasazi shades from their
glow kits I'm going to using sunburst
and summer I'm applying these with the
damp morphe m5a1 brush I absolutely love
this brush for highlighting it's so nice
and so precise
it's obviously extremely um worn out
because I use it and rub it all over my
face all the time but it still does its
job
hey this is what you gangster I just
want to add it's a fake freckles quickly
if you don't know how to make fake
freckles and you would like to you can
feel free to check out this video which
I already uploaded on my channel on how
to make fake freckles so go ahead and
watch it they're super trendy this
summer for my lips today I'm going to be
going in with over liquid lipstick in
the shade
this look at lipstick is all my favorite
shades from Oprah it's so cute and I
feel like it's perfect for summertime
since people are finally willing to wear
bright colors thank God but if you don't
want to wear a purple lip I get you girl
I feel it on a spiritual level not every
day as a purple lip kind of day so I
went ahead and I give you guys two other
lip options
this is Oprah's Laguna Beach it's a nude
pink color and it's one of my absolute
fave this last lip option is over liquid
lipstick in the shade
it's another anoint absolute phase it's
so cute and if you want to keep it
really bright for summer but you don't
want to do a bright ass purple this is
the perfect shade for you basically the
point of this is is that this look is
really cute and you can choose whatever
look close you want and you'll still
look good so you get the best of all the
worlds all the liquid lipsticks I
mentioned in this video tonight are from
Oprah cosmetics as you guys know they're
one of my absolute favorite brands and I
talk about them literally all the time
in my opinion that liquid lipstick
formula is the best on the market so if
you decide to purchase for them please
tell them I said hi and you can use code
Jay Chou's from 30% off your order

fun getting back into the swing of
things and filming for you guys now that

new setup I'm going to try so hard to
get out as many videos as I possibly can
