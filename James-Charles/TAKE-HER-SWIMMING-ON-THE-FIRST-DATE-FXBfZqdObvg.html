welcome back to our YouTube channel for
today's that I have something very very
crazy and fun planned and that is this
take her to me on the first date makeup
tutorial now this video totally inspired
by sister Kathleen light she posted a
video about a week ago and her channel
where she tested waterproof makeup it
was so funny and so freakin cute and
they had to do the same thing a while
ago on Twitter it was this huge ugly ass
trend for straight boys to post pictures
of girls with it without makeup next to
each other and be like take her swimming
on the first date oh sorry chikan
because we have settings right and
waterproof makeup we have a ton of
products laid out in front of me right
here that are all waterproof makeup
items I am going to put them on and
create a look with them and then I have
a pool party later on today so we're
actually going to go in the water and
test these out so if you want to see how
these actual waterproof products hold up
in the water make sure you keep on
watching so to start off today angry
priming my face using the brighter dates
highlighting moisturizer I actually
could not find a waterproof primer and
I'm pretty sure don't fault me on this I
am NOT - Bill Nye the Science Guy but
I'm pretty sure that that's because most
foundations do have a little bit of
water in them so I think using a
waterproof primer would probably make
the foundation like coagulate and get
all wonky looking on the face for a
foundation today we're going to be
taking us up away from the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation tip because
that is not waterproof and we're going
to using the Mac Pro Longwear a
nourishing waterproof foundation and I
got the shade MC 25 I'm not sure it is
going to match me I am praying that it
will because it's the only shade that I
bought so okay this could be good I have
actually never tried this foundation
before and I've never actually tried
maximizations in general besides from
the foundation powder so I'm super
scared to see how this wears but it
definitely claims it is a waterproof
foundation and I feel like if I was to
jump in the water foundation would be
the first thing that would like to get
all messed up so let's see how this
holds up it looks good this is actually
really good match okay you guys know
that I do like to make myself look a
little bit more tanned of my foundation
just because we've had some very very
unfortunate situations in the past that
we will not be speaking of today but I'm
not going to be doing that today I guess
but honestly this is a very very close
color match to my neck so we're just
going to roll it we're not going to be
tan today I guess we're just going to
use a lot of bronzer later on now that I
base is all on I'm actually loving how
my skin low
and I'm going to tell you guys another
curveball we will not using any shape
tape today and I leave using the makeup
forever full coverage concealer and I'm
in the shade 1 and this is also
waterproof waterproof why don't I just
say that so weird
so this shade is definitely very very
good for highlighting underneath the
eyes but I guess the color isn't
necessarily the point of this video it
is obviously going to be whether or not
it resists under water so let's go ahead
and apply her as normal the consistency
of this concealer is like very very
strange it almost is like a whipped type
of formula it's not very like liquidy
it's definitely a lot of thicker but I
do like how this is applying so far and
I'm excited to see how it blends out in
a second Wow
all right so I just went ahead and I
lost my face in place using my Kat Von D
lock-it translucent setting powder and
now let's go ahead and move on with the
bronzer to bronze my face up today for
that summer glow I'm going to use the
Tarte Amazonian clay waterproof bronzer
in the shade
park a princess I'm applying this
Taipei's using my morphe M 570 and
ethmoids you can use code change for 10%
off your purchase at morphe brushes calm
but I actually really like this bronzer
okay I'm actually really curious to see
how the powders are going to hold up in
the water this is definitely a powder
bronzer but it does say it's waterproof
so I'm really curious to see like what
ingredients or what properties allow it
to stay on in the water because normal
huge things like water mixing with a
powder would definitely destroy it and
silly I did do that video a long time
ago on my Instagram page Roy dug my face
in the shower sounds good to me
and I makeup actually see it on
perfectly and I was not even trying to
use waterproof stuff then
so my face could say perfectly exactly
the way it is locked in place but we're
going to find out as soon as I get my
face into a very cool pool and then for
blush today I'm going to grab my ax
Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour blush which
is also waterproof in the shade to do
for brows today we're going to pull an
oldie but a goodie and that is the
anasazi beverly hills dipbrow and i am
in the shade dark brown it is honestly
probably like a good year or so since
I've used a dip brow product as opposed
to like a brow pencil because lord knows
I used to have some very very scary
Sharpie eyebrows and ever since then
I've been way too nervous to go back to
this I'm honestly super scared today but
I'm just going to go really really
lightly insert to build it up so we
don't get that like super thick Lego
brow effect I want to do my brows today
by the way I'm using my morphe t29 brush
everything God this actually is turning
out a lot better than I was expecting
who once I have those brows basically
shaved out I'm going to go back in a
little bit more of that makeup forever
full coverage concealer
fits on my morphe 43 brush and just
clean up the bottom of those brows and
tend to say before I don't have a lot of
proved primer I am going to use is
considered as well to prime my eyelids
for a shadow and I decided lock these
rather interesting result in place I'm
going to just use the Anasazi clear a
brow gel and brush to the hairs so I do
have some waterproof I have products
that we will get to in a second but
obviously there are no waterproof
eyeshadow unfortunately those do not
exist
just yet but for today's look I'm just
going to use some single shadows that
are all from on a selfie Everly Hill and
I think one from colour-pop as well and
my custom palette right up in here if
you guys like me to do a video on this
custom palette as well definitely let me
know because these are like my go-to
favorite shades but I'm just going to
quickly throw on a look I'm for Senate
we have a BH orange soda at the
transition shade I'm going to go for a
very very light I look today with a pop
of color on the bottom lash line so I'm
just first topping this into the crease
to create like a nice blending point for
every other shadow that we're going to
use later on I would have Center grabbed
the shade of blazing on my are 39 rush
it is like a burnt orange but I just
have a little bit of red undertones as
well and the shadows that I'm going to
be using from Tarte in a second it's
actually rose gold so I do want to have
a little bit of a mix of a red and
orange so the gold tones match you'll
see what I mean I'm just placing the
color on the outer third of my eyelid
with brush and then I'm just going to
lightly blend it up into the crease and
towards the center of the lid I'm next
gonna grab that same brush and dip into
this Mac blush in the shade sketch
obviously this is a blush but you can
use it for eyeshadow as well I haven't
been able to actually find a good like
dark red single shadow that doesn't have
like purple undertones that has just
like regular red so if you guys know of
one please let me know but I've been
loving this blush to darken up bread and
now for the star of the show to cut my
crease today I'm gonna be using the
Tarte Amazonian clay pot in the shade
rose gold oh my god this is so pretty
holy crap okay I am so frickin shocked
right now because of these little clay
pots are so pretty and they are actually
the one thing aside from the liner that
is waterproof in this eye look so if
this entire face comes up in the water I
praying that at least these say on
because this is so beautiful for lined
up today I'm going to quickly throw in a
wing you see my Makeup Forever aqua XL
liner I mean the waterproof thing is
actually in the title so hopefully this
wing will stay on and be on fleek even
in the pool for the lower lash line
today I'm going to grab another one of
those Tarte little clay pots and this is
in the shade at crystal ball and it is
just like blue purple iridescent color
and I'm so freaking excited to see how
this actually looks and I'm just gonna
apply this using a pencil brush I'm just
going to buff this into the lower lash
line for a little pop of color oh wow
that's really pretty so this little pie
is definitely very very beautiful but
not as pigmented as the rose gold one so
I'm going to do is dip in that same
brush and dip into the color pumps
English shadow piece of cake and just
use that as a base and layer this shadow
over top for a brighter path before
lashes and first I wanted to end curl
them for last time I'm going to pop on
daylily lashes in the style Doha these
are really really beautiful and I
definitely want to do a light and flirty
lash and if their lashes I actually
can't find a waterproof lash glue so
this can easily do a 1 as always we may
be hearing some girls screaming the pool
thinking that there's a spider winner in
reality it may just be my floating
missing lash and then to blend my
natural lashes with the fake ones I'm
going to use of course the Too Faced
better than sex waterproof mascara
out of this entire look the thing that I
am most scared about wearing off in the
water is going to be the actual mascara
but this one it does claim it is
waterproof and I know better than sex is
a very very good formula it is
definitely like one of those staple
makeup items that are no plain favor so
I'm hoping to this lemma laughs in the
water
alright guys and that is one a
waterproof I already complete I'm going
to go ahead and quickly do the other one
off-camera and then I'll be right back
to finish off the rest of the look and
we could to take a dip alright so now
that the eyes are both done and complete
our next type is going to be of course
the glow and unfortunately Highlander
was the one thing that I could not find
a waterproof version of today so I'm
going to using the over X
nikkietutorials collab and her shade
ever glow this hair is so bomb if you
could James to 30% of all over products
this collection is sold out but they
have a ton of other amazing highlighters
on their site
so last and final step of this book is
obviously going to be the lips and I
thought I had a lot of waterproof
lipsticks but apparently all the ones
that I thought our waterproof were
actually just 24-hour along wearing
formulas so not technically waterproof
but they should last hopefully in the
water I don't really know how this is
going to work out but I apologize for
that and the one I'm gonna be using
today is the over liquid lipstick in the
shade dominatrix I know Sam is going to
be to lock this entire face in place and
hopefully create a barrier between the
skin and the water using our Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray as you guys
build this up it's very very long
wearing and long-lasting it'll keep any
makeup on so hopefully that includes in
the pool alright guys so this would be
waterproof makeup look I'll complete I
absolutely love how this turned out and
all these products actually look really
really bad so I'm so excited to actually
put them to the test
I'm gonna head out right now because I'm
running very very late but I'll see you
guys in a few short seconds all right so
the pool parties didn't exactly work out
because sister James 18 and they're
being really really difficult for no
reason at all about letting me in
whatever ambience is there can see but I
have our own pool party on the rooftop
so pumpkin
all right so been sitting on for quite a
while now I can definitely see on the
sides of eyelashes about a fly off but
it is time for the big reveal
sister magic I please have my mirror oh
god it looks so fabulous
oh you're kidding this is our year
definitely color glued and the light is
also God which is surprising considering
this liner was the Makeup Forever aqua
expound liner and it is loosely
waterproof but it is definitely it's
pretty much gone except for the wing
she's still ready to cut a bit and see
if on fleek as the actual eye shadow the
rest pop penguins from tarp are looking
still really really pretty and glittery
but the red eyeshadow and orange
eyeshadow that were from the Anasazi
single shadows obviously are pretty much
gone now but they were not waterproof to
begin with so not mad about it my brows
are definitely still here - they look
pretty pretty on fleek and even the brow
gel kind of held up the brow hairs are
definitely in place and they feel crusty
which is good because that's the frogs
are supposed to do pardon them and lock
in a place similar to a hairspray so I'm
definitely not right at the brown zone
either the blue and the Laurel Asik I
don't know if you can see because of the
shadows of the Simon also looks bomb now
for the part that we actually all care
about the concealers the foundation the
bronze are the highlight all the states
products after the actual foundation I
am honestly so beyond impressed
my skin looks really really bomb I'm
only crossing in a few places one of
them being my fire line but you guys
know that I said in every video I always
get really bad crack they're the only
place where you can definitely start to
see the foundation wearing off hard
course on the nose but I'm really not
that surprised because lord knows my
nose it's definitely a large operate out
of everything I honestly think I'm
probably most impressed with the bronzer
and the blush now you guys sounded smart
earlier they were both complete powders
so I'm honestly so sure the deductive
they still have to complete payment on
my face the contour bronzer is si still
there and my blush is looking nice and
pink and rosy as well so definitely a
major plus to tart on that honestly all
the tar products that we try say they
claim they're waterproof pretty much
stayed completely amazing underneath the
water so I am so shook right now I'll
raise dishes in that at all house today
for this waterproof makeup tutorial for
the both for it honestly so impressive
on these products they definitely still
look very very beautiful on the skin
even after dark you may face in the
water for a very very long time doing
lots of a factual fun show
pants and everything in the book
obviously some products held up much
better than others but overall I am
super impressed let's definitely keep -
this is the full phase of liquids creams
and powders induction to a full on a
pool I'm so happy with these results the
basis of this video is common to the
whole taker swimming on the first day
thing which is literally the most
ridiculous message ever just a PSA for
everyone out there we were makeup to
impress ourselves and it feel beautiful
and confident not to impress you if you
can't love your boyfriend or girlfriend
the exact same amount when they have
full glam on or not a drop of makeup you
need to find somebody new and if you are
the Apple that's going to have the fame
of ignorant mindset just keep it in the
back of your head we have a whole lot of
waterproof products but it allows us to
that first date if you guys enjoyed
