welcome back to our YouTube channel
today I'm done to the very special guest
BAE's rug I thought this is a club you
never thought you would see coming no me
either I know thank you
first today's video has something very
very plagued I obviously am in the
beauty community and Brian is in the
vlogging community but before he was a
blogger he was a gamer a full-time
gaming a nerd and I just feel like those
worlds are two opposites and right now
we're having likely opposites collide so
for today's video I'm gonna teach Brian
how to do my makeup and then after that
he's gonna teach me how to be
professional gamer and we're gonna face
off in black ops I'm so excited to do
this
me too even though we have virtually
nothing in common I think this will
probably be really really funny and a
definite awesome challenge
for the two of us to try out each
other's the thing that we do best also
if you guys want to check out the video
we did on my channel James here turned
me into a beautiful drag queen and he
did a 10 out of 10 job so if you guys
want to see that work come over to my
channel and check out the check it out
it was a great love a good bearded
sister alright guys so since part 1 of
this video is gonna be teaching at
sister Brian how to do my full face of
makeup
I clearly already have a full-on look so
let's go ahead and take it off and get
started with the video let's do it okay
so now a bare face and ready to go as
you could see my face is looking a
little bit bad right now
I had a facial this morning my sister
Yoli glow popped all my pimples for me
just let you know beauty gurus can have
pimples 217 million layers of foundation
we are definitely far from perfect but
without further ado let's go ahead and
cover this up please let's do it I got
you so do you know what the first step
of this is going to be foundation yeah
really yeah okay there I don't really
know what foundation is but is it this
yeah no way yeah okay
see I did learn a thing or two from our
videos yeah I love that we just did a
quick sister switch a room already yeah
oh my god okay so you're gonna want to
pounce it in as opposed to like rubbing
it yeah like this yeah okay okay that
looks better
yeah
all right so you're just talking about
how you broke out like extremely bad do
you know I'm not bad but do you use
makeup to like feel more confident about
her like just to hide it in stuff or
yeah I actually wear makeup like as an
art makeup for me has never been
something as the way to like hide
insecurities or anything although I
definitely feel like really confident
and pretty where the full face that
makeup off for me I basically just wear
makeup like as an art form and to kind
of express myself I never really need it
to like feel pretty but I I mean like
definitely some people do yeah as like a
straight guy who's like dates girls
obviously what is your opinion on like
when girls wear makeup to me not to
sound cheesy at all like girls don't
need make-up to express how they look
but like if it's something like you said
like it's an art like if it's something
that they enjoy doing that of course
they're gonna do it if anything if
anyone is into makeup and passionate
about it like that just makes them more
attractive like their personality true
it is so true honestly after spending
the day with you like I've learned so
much about makeup and how it's really
not only about the looks like I swear
like it it it feels like I'm being
artistic now yeah it's weird like I love
it isn't it fun it is you want basically
all the come together we focus on the
highlights of your face let's go bring
brightness and attention to the center
all right perfect
okay so next I was gonna be our powder
so Brian is gonna use the Beauty Blender
and is going to dip it in and then he's
gonna set first I always sort with
underneath my eyes it's okay cuz that's
what creases first okay so I have a
question for you yeah you started on
YouTube I think five and a half years
ago now that's a little crazy but you
just turned 21 correct yeah okay so me
and Brian are really not that far off
age wise but you do flaws correct yeah
now there's definitely been some drama
and the vlogging community of people
making a fool of themselves I'm not
gonna name any names here was it strange
for you as someone who like shares our
entire life with the internet and
obviously I do this as well but to go
from being a normal everyday like high
school student to all the sudden being
watched by millions of people and now
considered a role model
honestly the transition from like not
being anything to becoming something is
a blessing first cuz like it's it's
insane that like this money people
actually want to watch my videos sure
wanna like stay updated with my life I
never really started to pop off until
after high school huh
but honestly it's crazy to me because I
have a bunch of my old friends that
snapchat me to this day like watching my
videos and I'm like that's so crazy that
like that is weird that they stick with
my life that like Emily we don't really
talk that much but like they still like
like keep up with my day-to-day life
yeah okay so I was doing my sister
research on your channel and I saw that
you joined like I think it was two years
ago
mhm so it was not too long ago mm-hmm
how has that changed your life it's
definitely like a blessing to have so
many people like looking up to as like a
role model but I think that it's
definitely also a really scary thing as
well because like we never really knew
where we're gonna be like it's not exact
five years ago you knew you're gonna be
like where you are now I felt like when
I first put on makeup I knew I was gonna
sign with carpet girl and yeah blow up
to where I am not like never in a
million years what I haven't imagined so
it's not like I really started doing
this to become like a role model yeah so
what all of sudden millions of people
are watching and I feel like you do
instantly get that tag as a role model
there's really nothing you could do to
kind of get rid of it we're gonna
contour our face using the Kat Von D
shade on a palette right now but it's
kind of like a really really
overwhelming feeling to all the sudden
how that many people watching and
looking up to I feel like it's
definitely like scary and you obviously
have to like be on your best behavior
and not make a really stupid mistakes
yeah of course many names yeah I mean I
myself have made tons and tons and tons
of mistakes my it's I think it's really
really awesome to like be a role model
for young people and get people like
watching you looking up to you that
placement is perfect really okay and
then just blend it in so the point of
contouring is basically like it adds
shadows to the face when you're putting
up there on my cheekbones because it's
like the very bottom my cheekbone it
makes it look like I have like really
snatched okay she thought if that makes
any sense no it does it's looking really
good right now laughs I think I'm doing
a good job what do you guys think I love
that confidence yeah it looks pretty
good so basically we knows cotton we're
gonna be putting two lines on
the side of my nose as closely as
possible so it looks really really
pinched okay does that make sense
no you don't want to follow the natural
shape in the nose that's kind of the
whole point you try to fake it oh oh
yeah our next one's gonna be to add a
little bit of blush before we move on to
the eyes and this goes on the apples of
my cheeks the apples like a nice smile
like do they look like
even definitely you have a lot of color
going on our next one's gonna be to bake
definitely help me out yeah gonna take
the Beauty run with a powder on it right
I'm gonna go right up against your nose
contour so right there all the way down
and see how that line is perfectly
parallel yeah yeah yeah on the other
side perfect
yeah so while we're baking in the oven
our next step is going to be the
eyebrows oh no we're on that level yeah
oh not the worst I used to at aside
without brow no I'm gonna make this one
better
don't give up on this one always okay
watch I can fix it yeah all right all
right I got this
I feel so concentrated it's ridiculous I
wanna show you how I would do this yeah
okay once you get to the tail there's
clearly like a lot going on over here
right now that's okay if you clean it up
so I'm gonna bring it out and then up
top also needs a little bit more
definition okay I'm gonna pull this up
right here and then bring it down
so has a nice arch and shape and then
I'm gonna go right under
oh yeah come up the Little Miss I made
oh that actually looks good
interesting wait this one's hard like
the eyes are actually harder to do than
the face yeah yeah for sure
okay so the brows are all complete next
up it's going to be the eye shadow
yes I'm first gonna dip into like a
light warn Shea nothing we called our
transition color and that's gonna go
right in the eyelid and that like makes
everything blend really nicely together
okay and I'm gonna dip into a more burnt
orange shade and that's gonna go in the
crease again but it's gonna keep it more
concentrated so it's gonna add more
dimension there's no way I could
possibly mess this one up
you'd be surprised okay I think that
same shader I'm gonna pack it on like
the outer portion of the lid I don't dip
into like this dark brown shade right
here and then pop that right into the
outer area of the violet so right on
that outer corner
just like that see okay I'm gonna grab
this shimmery shade up here I'm gonna
spritz it with a little bit of fix+
and by adding water to a shimmery shadow
it makes it more vibrant okay I'm gonna
pop that right on the inner corner and
hug it right up there that's good yeah
that actually does that and then our
eyeliner I'm gonna do a winged liner
with the one right here uh-huh okay all
right so I'm gonna grow like this I'm
gonna take a tiny line I think you can
recreate that on the other eye
I can probably recreate like all this
like the first steps then this part
where I have to actually draw it I don't
think I'm gonna be able to do that no
that's true actually I'll make it better
that's the thought let's do it so you're
gonna hold that like this Oh
oh go wait I kind of went a little bit
too high it's okay so you can see that
for I could see so in that case you're
gonna want to grab a clean brush and
just go over that edge to kind of make
sure like the color is diffused and
that'll hot really make sure the colors
I can evenly distribute everywhere there
aren't ready rules to make up it's a lot
about self-expression but the number one
rule that is a rule is you have to blend
okay blend blend blend logo move line
all right I'll keep that in mind there
you go
okay so the way you're holding it right
now it's bad yah-ha-ha-ha-ha
since you got a little bit of makeup on
the side of the brush if you hold it
like this
not only is it putting it in the crease
but it's also putting it all up here -
because you're rubbing it on so when
you're applying eyeshadow especially
when you want to make it more defined
you want to make sure to hold it that
brush as parallel as possible so it's
really only getting the point right in
that crease or even lower so sometimes
you can get a little bit on the lid but
that's okay because you're gonna cover
up anywhere - okay is this like the the
glam one okay so it's it's this one
right here no that one no
you're ready for the winged liner oh man
my favorite part okay I'm ready for this
all right I used to take art class in um
sixth grade oh I got an F but Picasso is
Shh
you ought to end today as pointed as you
can possibly get I try try let's see if
you could fix it up that is definitely
not fixable oh she's gonna be really
thick so even if you mess up you could
just fix it with concealer is that like
the concealers like the go-to of them
okay like we have a good concealer
you're pretty much unstoppable so if I
go like this ready I'll take my
concealer there's like to make it
thinner kinda looks great I think I did
a great job on that uh-huh I have two
washes here these are my all-time
favorite style there are Lily lashes in
the style Miami's and you're gonna glue
them on to me today okay all right I got
this you basically want to put it right
at my eyelashes as close to like the
lash line as you can get then you want
to make sure it's sticking all the way
you know happy I get when you get that
excited yeah when I do something right
love a good sister eye lash application
so while that was on your face didn't do
anything yeah so basically like leaving
the powder on there for a little while
it kind of brightens everything up so
like I was telling you how you put the
contour to kind of create those shadows
yeah the baking powder helps intensify
the highlights to just further the
illusion of like more chiseled features
okay okay so our next one is gonna be
the highlighter this is the one time
where you do want a lot of product on
the brush it off and then you're gonna
put it right on top of the cheekbone
that doesn't seem like something I can
mess up but we've said that about
everything see that glow oh that's nice
give it a little world world huh yeah so
good okay okay so I also like to do
highlighting on my nose to make my nose
look nice and pinched so you want to
make sure to draw this small ass line
you possibly can or right down the
center cuz that really creates like
starting from Legree here yeah mm-hmm
perfect so this is the liquid lipstick
meeting goes on obviously a liquid and
it has this little don't foot applicator
relate to call it but it dries down a
fully map like a normal lipstick so you
get like a little bit of wiggle room so
you're gonna go ahead and apply this on
me and I like to over line a little bit
only on the top left so basically I go a
little bit over my natural lip line to
make them look nice and Tuesday okay I
got this
as you can see I'm not like a good
tracer that was something I wasn't good
at as a kid staying inside the lines
yeah I can tell
when in doubt when something goes wrong
conceal it yeah okay okay so we have one
final step which is gonna be to set our
face in place so it last through all the
sweat blood and tears it's about to go
down in our gaming session okay all
right
quick spritz when you do setting spray
it's really great to use like a palette
or a fan too kind of fanning the liquid
out for the back and that kind of makes
all the powders and stuff like meld
together and look more like skin as
opposed to okay a million products just
kind of like slightly yeah all right
really proud of you really yeah thank
you literally like you were being so
patient the entire time you really were
like asking a lot of questions to make
sure you're doing the right thing yeah
if something was wrong you asked me how
we could fix it and I feel like the
finish result came out like pretty good
thank you yeah no there's just so much
that I was interested in like there's so
much more to make up than I thought
there's a lot it's all I was really
interested this is like a class yeah
it's like an art class I feel like when
guys are always like getting their girl
writing like oh my god babe like why are
you ready yet we did go this is why
that's Larry's okay I don't blame them
for taking back for real yeah do you
think you could ever like recreate this
look again do you think you have like
enough makeup knowledge no - I think I
actually do yeah yeah I should do my
mom's you see double your house makeup
first show that I had so much fun
teaching you I'm so appreciative that
you were like willing to hear everything
that I wanted to tell you or just tips
and tricks and stuff regardless I think

game let's game let's do it okay guys so
we're here on black ops 3 and I guess
we're gonna be playing some zombies

to do your makeup you have to teach you
how to game this is where it all started
for me yeah so I'm gonna turn you into
the best gamer ever okay are you ready I
think

in a while but I am pretty good at
Bobby's Oh that'd be learning from the
bass I used to be like an avid gamer

I used minutes when I was younger with
my brother but I remember before I
wasn't the kind of a closet to him we'd
be planning on like Xbox Live and like a
little every 15 seconds in here oh my
god you're fucking fat can't believe you
just kill nearly I died that's so gay I
would always like people hate me they
don't even know me yeah it's so intact
the gaming community no I know that it
sucks yeah because like when people say
oh that's so gay they really mean they
say like oh this sucks you suck like I
don't think they need to say in an
offensive way but like some people just
don't realize what's coming out of their
mouth but I always remember like trying
to be in this like gaming world I guess
but like always and cynically yeah
because it's like kind of tough when
like people are screaming out gaily
every five seconds but there's nothing
wrong with being gay people just say how
to finger okay I don't realize that like
it was actually an offensive now saying
wow how real of an educated I just went
down again hold on the pro gamer goes
down four times you know just kill them
for now
honestly nine round nine rounds that's a
really good sister I'm proud I'm
actually surprised I'm shocked just how
you were shocked like I could do like
some stuff with makeup I'm shocked that
you could actually like kill a zombie
yeah you went down more than I actually
I'd be you did better than me
I'm the gaming pro gamers are who are
shaking face clad watch out sisters
Faye's Charles Oh sister okay sister
that was so intense I literally feel
like I could take over a zombie
apocalypse being you
yeah sesame yeah okay alright sister so
that is all we have for this challenge
today I literally had so much fun today
even though like I said earlier me and
Bryan don't really have a lot in common
I think it was so cool to kind of like
trade places and see into the other
person's like industry and what they
really really love to do we were
definitely brought together by a strange
Instagram live occurrence but I'm say
never in a million years did I think I'd
be into makeup like that yeah and like
after today I kind of want to actually
go home and try to do my mom's makeup I
think years old I don't really how
devoted you were to it like you really
cared you took your time with like
thought was so cool it really is like an
art like yeah it's it's not just makeup
like you throw on makeup it's like
precision and like creativity
yeah it's stuff like that so like I
actually enjoyed it yeah and I never in
a million years expected to like be
playing freaking black ops or a
professional gamer but without that one
we killed it we got so far and it was
really awesome to kind of participate in
a world that I was once literally
horrified out because of some like the
nasty comments and stuff but you do have
to understand that like these are really
really young kids yeah are educated and
exactly fingers crossed they will find
their cost and they definitely what
they're saying is offensive sometimes
before class that there's people like
you who are like leading a community of
people especially young kids as well and
you like teach them right from wrong and
that that's super super awkward if you
guys enjoyed today's video please don't
forget to give it a big thumbs up down
below and not only for Bryan's amazing
makeup but for my amazing zombie-killing
skills
