well so today I'm excited to sit down
and film a collab video we did a little
chitchat get ready with us we are about
an hour and a half way to an event right
now so we kind of like Zippity duped up
sped right through this yeah I'm like
taught Ricky what's one of the make up
road because he's trying to try out
makeup recently anyway I don't know what
to do and he taught me today yes so go
honesty I've created these looks and
just enjoy our conversation they're
definitely interesting to say the least
make sure you keep on watching so we're
in first off by priming our faces and
I'm going to use the benefit
Porefessional primer so it's Ricky Oh
head on over and we're cool stop it's
like really good oh my Tris camera oh
wait yeah it was fun Oliver yeah
alright
glad you like my neck um it's not that
Jesus really matter okay you love that
phrase don't you I really do
how much for counting from you say it
give me good brows good I'm learning
that and I'm so hit or miss I like doing
where they went one time and it'll be
horrible then I could be like one of my
video visually they were so bad for
people and all the comments were like
what happened is eyebrows but I like the
next figure they look good okay so trick
is a cool just showing what's the
question I don't know what should I do
this to if you want to um yeah the
person is scored they matched it with me
so if it's not right then it's their
fault that look right that color does
actually okay let's draw it on you have
to pathway count it up and down like
okay this is like okay how does that
blend it out though you just happen in
look at no oh wow whoa shook an iconic
invention I'm shooken
the gold his ticket at every nook and
cranny possible without raising your
forehead but also get creases and then
we'll be crusty your crusty
thank Thank You uncle we're great one to
conceal our okay conceal don't I make
that joke with my litter every time I do
a video that joke about to come up
that's what my brain goes to
sing frozen to the about to say that
sounds familiar
Oh fun fact about my eyes they water
really oh my mother for suddenly this
cooperation just actually got cake yeah
um I mean it I'm like fine but like if
you see while rescuing out oh it's like
quite a task
it really is yeah well that's when
you're texting you're like oh how I'm
just going to take like an hour nothing
oh this is jacking this one I use for
like video to take like two minutes
must be that's very very basic I just
it's just like you want like you want to
like even out your skin tone and
everything about you right so like when
you do your makeup and sup if we do
highlighting and contouring you want to
add as much contrast to your face as
possible alright it's like when you put
on your foundation obviously it's like
one color if it's like full converse
like you don't want to be like Flat
Stanley no I don't be like dimensional
so like have my videos and oh okay self
Drago's always whoa I mean yeah this
goes on the cheekbones
do I let sure it actually like every
nice feeling I truly do like I like a
good sneeze me she loves yeah I do it's
like the best bodily functions by far
right so wait what are you putting this
um on the cheekbones so like this I'm
like right below oh wow never never
never never never
it always goes like on the cheekbones
anyone upwards I thought that how it
goes the cheekbones
yeah so I thought bronzer where do you
think bronzer goes like it okay like
what hold on
like in know what no no no the whole
point okay so your dental bronzer like
here and blend upwards and then you want
this part to be boy yeah that's enough
that makes your cheekbones okay son get
in that's what you want you on like how
snaps cheekbones do it for me oh needy
okay likewise okay okay I'm hats right I
do I do it right there I don't blend up
I just kinda like yeah like luck
got this like right here and this
article I'm talking but this this storm
situation will go actually below yes
yeah I do this to how to get below like
a Big D print some shadow then I'll make
your drawing will play stronger okay and
then same thing on the forehead oh not
words and there's nothing for head
before yeah so look actually you only
need to give a small for her anyway must
be nice cannot relate unfortunately but
like yeah actually she the bed oh it's
pretty bad so bad okay let me try it up
again boom whoa watch it okay tap that
off I rubbed it like twice yeah you're
Adam see y'all up it's blue
okay it was that enough yeah now try it
lightly light top there you go that's it
no do it again there you go
well I like Tom take it off hey Lucas
good nice amar I love the nail thing
literally make up I swear make up like
it's over lock that you like I I
personally as Martin close to you I do
you really I kinda like I come on really
yeah I know it really does help a lot of
people like for me I just cannot help
but start like rocking up Beauty stuff
is like littering all like oh tapping
all robbing like something I got to do
as a mouth like a daily basis just like
everyday makeup routine so I think maybe
that's not like I'm you twit at this
point but again I don't like go watching
it but I stumbled upon it I get that
like it's like the pimple popping videos
I'm backing into that really love gotcha
boo love me a good blockhead Oh God
now that we've conquered and bronze
we're going to go ahead and bake our
faces which is a drag technique so yes I
know cuz I watched a great I don't undo
that it okay so we're gonna get a whole
oh I love beta you do what kind of
pastry possible croissant left and right
you know the occasional all
nice Sunday morning or something no
matter what be careful cuz like okay so
God okay we're gonna let this set for
were done oh yeah that's good about okay
guys watch anyone ready to go okay
notice they were going to let this set
why don't I just eat it was just got too
serious too fast we're gonna let this
set for a like a few minutes and I'm
going to come back and we're gonna start
off on the brows and then finish off so
we are me we're gonna start oh this is
great
it doesn't look good I like we're gonna
get started on the brows we're and oh
gosh right now we are currently 37
minutes late for it so we're covering
Hey
okay so I'm gonna do one of Ricky's
borrows for him and we're going to see
how stache we can make it and then it's
gonna match it while I do mine
let's do this one time okay okay so now
I will go on concealer and I've seen it
up whoa alright like a ever worried
about making it perfect right away you
can always fix it
we're not to do I'm going to try to
match it I might end up having two
different looking eyebrows so it's okay
it's the thought that coming I'm gonna
start with my Anasazi dip brow and my
amore PE 29 and I'm going to begin
sketching out my brows as quickly as
possible
what's your favorite part makeup to do
my favorite part is probably um I shadow
it's like it's really fun and it's like
something new true if I do my face
always the exact same video so it kind
of gets boring um how does this look you
drew this problem really really low
whereas so that makes your brows sagging
a chance to like you're constantly
crowning see how this prob is like more
arched it like looks more like snatched
in like happier yeah I get it for this
distraught looks like sad Ricky um happy
Ricky so how do i what do I do
conceal under it okay like hold a mirror
this is high no it really really is this
is beauty guru video everyone so you
have to hold your head up hold the
mirror down so you can look in the
mirror okay and now you can see what's
going on in this region or your forehead
is increasing so it must does in the
mirror look at yourself but keep your
head up but look down to the mission
this is hard if I just like chopped that
up
what would you do when I probably ought
to do it not even beyond that it's so
ugly that's not I like it it's cute in a
bun but like oh man I'll take it down
later we're doing yeah like what does it
do
she kind of flops over it's so gross
well I'm getting it done on Thursdays I
haven't been washing it I'm gonna now
use my e45 to blend in my eye concealer
this stuff and then reconsider the same
exact thing I was about to say that he
said it before it couldn't though yes
just can't do for boys weirdest things
you're do you doing you're pretty good
whoa you're gonna cut it I needed your
editing video like I'd like to clean so
